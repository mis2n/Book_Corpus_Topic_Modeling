PREFACE 
Durin recent years there has been an increased call for 
Physics as part of a general education. At the same time there 
has been a decided dislike for the subject as it has been pre- 
sented. To meet both of these conditions, this book has been 
repared. 
Much has been said about the value of mathematics and 
cience as a means of mental discipline. The writer’s belief is 
hat it is the excessive attention paid to the mathematical side 
f Physics, together with the development of formulas, that 
as made the subject so difficult for the average student. There 
‘an be just as good mental training in developing the thought 
hat enables a pupil to answer a set of questions selected from 
very-day experiences, as can be obtained from the ability to 
olve a mass of problems, many of which have no connection 
ith the life of the pupil, and therefore mean little to him. 
The object of Household Physics is to present those phases 
f Physics which enter into the daily household life, introduc- 
ng each principle by means of some well-known application, 
hen explaining the principle, and finally presenting other appli- 
ations as a means of clinching the principle; first the known, 
ollowed by the unknown, and ended by the known. 
At the end of each main group of principles appears a set 
f questions on that group. At the end of each chapter is a 
et of questions covering the different groups in the chapter. 
hapten the book are questions covering the different 
oting . rere is en opportunity for three reviews, each 
none 2 anger e than the one preceding. Complete 
€ questions cannot often be found in the text.

    A well-founded knowledge of the principles and applications 
however, will enable the pupil to think out the answers. 
There is enough material in the text to allow the teach 
considerable latitude in the selection of work for a year’s course, 
and the pupil at the end should be in a position to appreciate the 
many phenomena that take place about him, and should be abl 
to answer most of the questions that deal with Physics in o 
daily life. 
Non-technical words have been used as far as possible i 
the explanations of principles and applications. Wherever ne 
essary, the applications as well as the principles are given carefi 
explanation, and are not left to the student to work out. Ter 
and definitions are for the most part introduced when thei 
application follows almost immediately. 
As far as possible the text is limited to physical phenomen 
those phases of household life that come more properly und 
the realm of chemistry being purposely omitted. 
While the order of presentation of subjects is not the sam 
as that followed in most text-books, the writer feels that He 
is closer to the student’s life than is Mechanics, and therefor 
affords a better way of arousing the interest and desire fi 
information. The chapter on Mechanics is, however, presente 
in such a form that those who desire can just as well start wit 
this chapter, and take up Heat second. 
The chapter on Plumbing may be studied or not, as maj 
seem best. There are no new principles presented in thi 
chapter. It simply deals with the mechanical principles di 
cussed in the preceding chapters, showing how these principle 
are applied in household plumbing. 
Boys and girls are interested in Physics if only it can 
presented in such a way as to have a real meaning to the

Throughout Household Physics the writer has tried to present 
he subject more for the sake of the pupil than for the subject 
lone, and trusts that those who read may be awakened to 
bserve and appreciate the many wonderful phenomena that 
ake place daily about them. 
The writer wishes to extend his thanks for the use of illus- 
tations as follows: 
To the Illuminating Engineering Company of New York 
for Figures 49, 60, 94, and 106; to the Weston Electrical

Norman W. Henley Publishing Company of New York for 
Figures 327, 329, 332, 333, 336, 349- In conclusion the writer wishes to thank Mr. Thomas G. 
Rees, of the Mechanic Arts High School of Boston, for valued 
criticism of the manuscript.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
1, In our daily experiences we note the many changes that 
are going on about us. It is these that give variety to life, and 
the better we are able to appreciate them and understand their 
causes the greater becomes our enjoyment of life. 
Some of these changes are brought about by human or 
animal effort; others through what are called natural causes. 
In all of the changes something is accomplished for better or 
for worse. It may be said that the object of all existence is the 
accomplishment of something, small or great. This accomplish- 
Ment may be that of the mind or that of the body. In the sub- 
ject of Physics with which this book deals, bodily or physical 
accomplishment only is to be considered. The appreciation of 
it can come only through one of the five senses which are our 
only means of communication with the world about us. 
2, Physical and Chemical Changes. When we melt ice or 
boil water, magnetize a piece of iron, light an incandescent lamp 
with the electric current, produce music by playing on a piano, 
lor move objects about, we are in no way changing the identity 
or composition of the object. If the cause is removed the object 
returns to its original condition. On the other hand, when wood 
jor gas burn, when meat decays, when iron rusts, when plants 
tow, the substance is changing its composition. In the first of 
hese processes we have examples of physical changes, and in 
he second, of chemical changes. The latter will enter very little 
into our study. 
3. Energy. Whenever anything happens there is some driv- 
ing force behind the action. This driving force is due to what 
1 
     
    
      
    
        
    
   
-P-A-G-E-10
2 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
is called energy. Energy is encountered in various forms- 
heat energy,sound energy, light energy, and electrical, chemica 
and muscular energy—all of which bring about changes. 
4. Work. Whenever the above forms of energy manifes 
themselves they are said to do work. Whenever work is done 
an opposition of some sort, known as resistance, is overcome 
and a change in condition results. Very frequently this chang 
is one of motion. Whenever motion results, or is interfere 
with, we may know that two forces are opposing and that o 
is greater than the other. 
5. Measurement. All the changes that are going on abo 
us in our daily life may be looked upon from two points of vie 
the qualitative and the quantitative ; the first has to do with t 
kind of things and the second with the amount. If we ai 
buying cloth, we must first find the material of proper te: 
ture and color, and then tell how much of it we need. Thi 
quantitative side of things requires a system of measureme’ 
It may be of length, as in the case of cloth; of area, as of lin 
leum; of volume, as of milk, wood, or gas; of weight, as 
groceries and meats ; or even of time, when we employ labor. 
In the olden times trades were made by bartering, in whi 
an agreement satisfactory to both parties was made on the sp 
and the trade completed. There was no regular system 
standard of measurement. As years passed by and busine’ 
dealings became more complex, some standards of exchan; 
were necessary. Asa result of this demand came standards 
measurement, of quantity, time, and money. Each of the di 
ferent nations had its own system. For length, the length 
some part of the body was generally chosen as the unit. F 
weight, that of some particular well-known object furnish 
the standard.

INTRODUCTION 3 
| There are in use in civilized countries today two general 
systems of measurement : one with which most of us are familiar, 
as used in every-day life, known as the English; the other used 
extensively in scientific work, known as the Metric system of 
weights and measures. 
In the English system the standards have been arbitrarily 
chosen and named. The division and subdivision of these stand- 
ards has been haphazard and irregular, with the result that we 
have a very mixed up system, difficult to learn. As an example 
of this irregularity, we have as the unit of length the yard, 
divided into three feet, each foot being divided into twelve 
inches, Division of the inch into halves, quarters, eighths, six- 
teenths, thirty-seconds, etc., furnishes the first semblance of 
regularity. 
. In weighing, the same confused condition exists. Not only 
is the common division of the unit (the pound) irregular, but 
the pound is divided in three different ways, according to the 
kind of substance to be weighed. We have avoirdupois weight 
for common articles, apothecaries’ weight for drugs, and troy 
Weight for valuables such as metals and precious stones. Each 
has its separate independent set of divisions. 
In the metric system, one general scheme of division is 
followed, whatever the character of the substance measured. 
There is a standard of length, of area, and of weight. When 
amounts other than the standard are to be considered, the 
decimal or tenths system is employed. This metric system was 
devised by a committee appointed by the Assembly of France 
atthe time of the French Revolution. It was an attempt to bring 
§'e nations of Europe to accept one common system of measure- 
gUet in order to bring about uniformity. It is at present adopted 
by Nearly all these nations. In England and America the old

English system is still used in business, although the metri 
system is employed almost exclusively in science. 
In order that the unit of length might be a fixed quantity 
that could be duplicated at any time, those in charge decided t 
take one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the 
pole, along the meridian that passed through Paris. A platinum 
iridium bar of this length was made and is kept at Sevres, nea 
Paris, at the Bureau of Weights and Measures. [It has sinet 
been found that this bar is not exactly equal to the length in 
tended, so that there is really no means of duplicating it exactl 
if it should be lost or destroyed. It is called a meter, and i 
equal to 39.375 inches in length. 
Given the standard of length, the meter, one-tenth of it i 
called the deci-meter ; one-tenth of a decimeter is called a centt 
meter; one-tenth of a centimeter is called a milli-meter. T 
meters make a Deka-meter ; one hundred meters make a Hekt 
meter ; one thousand meters make a Kilo-meter. 
In measuring area we have square centimeters, square deci      
     
    
     
     
     
   meters, square meters, etc. For measuring volume we hav 
cubic centimeters, cubic decimeters, cubic meters, etc. Just 
in the English system we have the quart for measuring liquid: 
so in the metric system we have the liter. The liter, howeve 
is regularly connected with the decimal system, being equal 
a cubic decimeter, which equals one thousand cubic centimeter: 
One liter equals 1.057 quarts. The quart and liter are thus ve 
nearly equal, the liter being only about a twentieth larger. 
In the system of weighing, the unit is the gram, which 
the weight of one cubic centimeter of water at a temperatu 
1To be more exact, the term mass or quantity of substance should be used here. 
mass of anything, such as the piece of platinum-iridium used as the standard of weight, is 
same wherever it may be carried. Its weight varies on different parts of the earth’s surfé 
owing to the difference in the attractive force of the earth. This difference is very slight, h 
ever, so that for our purposes it is sufficient to say weight, where mass might be more properly:

of 4° Centigrade or 39.2° Fahrenheit. At this temperature, as 
will be shown later, water is most dense. As this weight is 
very small, being equal to about one-thirtieth of an ounce, the 
standard is a piece of platinum-iridium metal that weighs 
one thousand times as much, called a Kilogram. This is also 
stored with the Bureau of Weights and Measures, and is equal 
to about 2.2 pounds. 
Amounts smaller than a gram are prefixed by deci, centi, 
| milli, as in the case of the meter. For the sake of convenience 
i writing, abbreviations of metric and English terms are used. 
The following table shows these abbreviations and the equiva- 
lents in the two systems: 
meter (m.) = 1.094 yards (yd.) = 39.37 inches (in.) centimeter (cm.) == .3937 inch 
kilometer (km.) == .6214 mile (mi.) 
Square meter (sq. m.) = 1.196 sq. yd. 
Square centimeter (sq. cm.) == .1550 sq. in. 
cubic meter (cu. m.) = 1.308 cn. yd. 
cubic centimeter (c. ¢.) == .061 cu. in, liter (1.) = r.os7 quarts (qt.)

through the sense of feeling that we are aware that there is 
such a condition as heat. We frequently try to determine the 
degree of heat by means of this sense, and many times fail to 
get an opinion that agrees with that of another person. The 
reason for this is that our temperature sense depends upon 
the temporary condition of the skin at the time. This condition 
depends upon where we have been previously or upon the 
amount of exercise we have been taking. It frequently happens 
that two persons coming into a room do not feel the same. The 
one coming from a much cooler place feels warm, while the 
other coming from a warmer place feels cool. Cold water from 
the faucet feels hot to a person whose hands are very cold. 
Because the body is not an accurate indicator of how hot or 
how cold an object is, we must resort to other means of deter- 
mining temperature. Such means lie in the effects of heat upon 
Something other than the human body. 
7. Effect of Heat upon Objects. Whenever heat is applied 
to an object, one or more of the following effects may take 
Place: (t) there may be a rise in temperature (the object be- 
Comes hotter); (2) there may be expansion (an increase in 
volume); (3) there may be a change of state (from solid 
to liquid, or liquid to gas); (4) there may be an increase in 
outward pressure onthe walls of the containing vessel ; (5) there 
May be a change in its characteristics. As examples of each 
case, we have for expansion the overflowing of the water in a 
tea kettle if it is completely filled with cool water and placed 
Over the fire; for change of state we have the melting of ice 
to form water, or the boiling of water to form steam; for in- 
crease in outward pressure we have the steam escaping from 
a covered kettle; for the change in characteristics we have the 
thinning of molasses and the softening of sealing wax.

EXPANSION EFFECTS 
8. Expansion of Solids. The expansion effect upon solids 
may be shown as follows: Figure 1 represents a ball and ring, 
both made of brass, the inside 
diameter of the ring being 
just equal to the diameter of 
the ball as long as both are 
at the same temperature. If 
the ball is heated consider- 
ably, it will be found that it 
will no longer pass through the ring. If the ring also is heated, 
the ball will now pass through. 
Figure 2 represents a bar of iron, one end of which rests 
firmly against the left support. The other end touches one end 
of a hinged pointer. Any movement of the right end of the rod 
    Fic 2,—THE PoInrzR Risks WHEN THE BURNING 
Gas HEATS THE Bar 
causes the pointer to rise or fall. If heat is applied, the pointer 
will rise, showing that the rod is expanding in length. Upon 
cooling, the pointer will fall back to its former position, showing 
that the contraction is equal to the expansion. 
Concrete sidewalks must be laid in sections, with spaces 
between to allow for expansion. When not so laid, they have 
been known to buckle on hot summer days. There are spaces
-P-A-G-E-17
HEAT 9 
between the ends of car rails in winter, while in summer the 
ends fit snugly. The metal girders of buildings are held firmly 
together by rivets which are put into the holes red-hot and the 
small end is hammered out around the edges of the hole, thus 
forming a double head. The rivets on cooling contract and 
hold the plates tightly together. The glass chimney of a lighted 
lamp is sure to crack if a drop of water falls upon it, owing to 
the great contraction on the spot cooled by the water. 
| g. Unequal Expansion of Different Substances. All solid 
substances are not affected equally by equal rise in temperature.

table show what portion of its original length a piece of each 
substance will increase when its temperature is raised one centi-

bar is heated, it will soon become curved, with the brass on t 
outside. If now cooled back to the original temperature, the ba 
will again become straight. If further cooled, however, it wi 
be found to curve with the iron on the outside. The brass b 
comes longer (expands more) than the iron on heating, a 
therefore takes a position on the outside of the curve; while of 
cooling it becomes shorter (contracts more) than the iron, anf 
therefore takes a position on the inside of the curve.

even temperature by regulating the hea 
supply. There are two systems in generd 
use, the electric thermostat 
being oftener seen in homes, 
and the compressed air type 
in large buildings. In the elec- 
tric system the dampers regu-

lating the drafts of the heater in the cellar are operated throug 
a magnet which the thermostat brings into action. The effect 
either to check or to force the fire in the heater. Which of the} 
two effects will take place depends upon whether the compouy
-P-A-G-E-19
HEAT It 
bar C (Fig. 4) is in contact with A or with B. If the room is 
too hot, the bar bends to the left, touching A. This completes 
an electric circuit that causes the fire to be checked. Likewise, 
if the room is too cool, the bar tends to straighten out, and the 
circuit is completed through B. This results in an increased 
draft and more heat. The figure shows the thermostat and the 
circuit through which the mechanism in the cellar operates 
the dampers (Fig. 4b). 
A glance at the table shows that different substances are not 
affected the same amount by equal temperature rises, but there 
are two that expand practically the same on equal 
heating ; these are glass and platinum. This fact 
makes platinum the only metal that can be used 
to connect the outside wires of the electric wiring 
circuit with the carbon or tungsten filament of 
our modern incandescent lamps. Since they are 
Sealed into the glass hot, the wires and glass upon 
cooling contract equally, and the wires are just 
as tight-fitting hot or cold. Any other metal would 
contract more than the glass and thus be loose, 
and allow air to get into the bulb. The presence 
of air would cause the filament to burn out and 
thus become useless. 
11, Expansion of Liquids. The expansion of 
liquids may readily be shown by fitting a glass 
tube into a hole in the stopper of a flask and 
filling the flask and part of the tube with water 
(Fig. 5). On being heated, the liquid will rise in the tube. 
Different liquids, stich as alcohol and mercury, may also be used, 
when it will be found that they do not expand equally, with the 
same temperature rise.   Fic. 5

       12. Expansion Effect Utilized in Determining Temper- 
ature Changes. Inasmuch as such substances as mercury, 
alcohol, and metals expand when heated and contract when 
cooled, it is possible to take advantage of this by properly| 
arranging the substance to indicate the changes. Figure 6 rep- 
resents a metallic thermometer in which the compound bar of 
brass and iron has one end B securely fastened to the support, 
  Fic. 6—METALLic DiaL THERMOMETER 
and the other end C is free to move. This end is connected to 4 
pointer P which rotates about its axis. When the temperatur¢ 
rises, the metal bar tends to straighten and the pointer is turned 
to the right. When the temperature falls, the bar curves more 
If the scale. is marked according to some accepted standard, 
thermometer is the result, and the pointer indicates the tenm 
perature. 
13. Liquid Thermometers. Commoner than the metalli 
thermometers, however, are those made by the use of som 
liquid such as mercury or alcohol. In these (see Fig. 7) a gla 
tube has a thin-walled bulb blown on one end. The open en

Fic. 7 HEAT 13 
is drawn out by melting the glass. The bulb is 
filled with mercury or alcohol, and is then 
heated. When the mercury reaches the top, 
the open end is sealed by melting the glass 
there, and the bulb is allowed to cool. As 
the mercury or alcohol cools, it contracts into 
the bulb, and the upper end of the column 
moves downward until the contraction ceases, 
i. e., until the liquid becomes the same temper- 
ature as the surrounding air. Such a piece of 
apparatus is good only for comparing the 
temperatures of different objects or of the same 
object at different times. 
14. Graduation of Thermometers. To make the above 
mentioned tube indicate temperatures, 
it must be marked and graduated 
according to some accepted standard. 
There are two such standards in 
Seneral use now: the commoner one, 
as seen in most households, called 
the Fahrenheit, and the other, used 
almost exclusively in science, called 
Centigrade. They differ only in the 
manner in which they are marked 
to indicate the intensity of the heat. 
Both employ the same methods in 
Securing the so-called fired points.

concerned, the two thermometer scales are the same; but as for 
the numbers representing them on the scale (such numbe 
hong Contgeede serving as a simple indicator of tempera 
sx Being ture), the scales differ. The freezing poinl 
on the Centigrade scale, which represents 
exactly the same degree of heat as on th 
Fahrenheit scale, is o (Fig. 9), while on the 
latter scale it is 32. The boiling point, re 
resenting exactly the same degree of he 
on both, is on the Centigrade scale mark 
100 and on the Fahrenheit 212.1. These num, 
bers, since they stand for certain degree 
of heat, are called degrees. Having locate 
the degree marks for the freezing and th 
boiling temperatures of water, the space o! 
the tube that lies between them must be divided into a numb 
of equal parts to represent intermediate degrees of heat. If 
certain heat addition to the bulb causes the mercury to ris¢ 
a certain distance up the tube, a double heat addition will pr 
duce twice as much rise. The space on the tube between freez    Freezi pont

1 Reason for the peculiar F, numbers. The probable explanation for the odd numbers 32: 
212 for freezing and boiling point on the Fahrenheit scale is that when Fahrenheit devised 
scale, the coldest thing known was a mixture of salt and ice, which he called zero. The tem 
ature of the human body was known to be pretty constant, and he called this 100 degrees. It 
since been shown that the temperature of the salt and ice mixture depends upon the proportit 
of each taken, Asa result, some change in the zero marking has come about, bringing the t 
perature of the body to 98.6, Freezing and boiling water bring readings of 32 and 212 on st 
ascale.

ing and boiling ort the Centigrade scale is divided into 100, and 
on the Fahrenheit scale into 180 equal divisions. 
16. Plus and Minus Readings. Since the freezing point on 
the Fahrenheit scale is 32°, zero on this scale is lower than 
freezing ; in fact, 32 Fahrenheit degrees lower. Now, inasmuch 
as we meet with conditions when the temperature is lower than 
0° C. and o° F., such degrees of heat are called minus (—), 
as contrasted with temperatures above 0°, which are called 
plus (+). In connection with this use of the plus and minus signs to 
indicate temperature above and below zero on either Fahrenheit 
or Centigrade scale, it must be borne in mind that it is possible 
to have a temperature which is minus on the Centigrade scale 
and plus on the Fahrenheit scale; this is because the freezing 
Point is not zero on both scales. A temperature of 0° F. would 
tegister nearly —18° C, 
—5° C. and 23° F. are both below freezing, —5° C. is below 
zero C., whereas 23° F. is above zero F. 
~20° C. and —13° F. are both below freezing and both 
below the zero of each scale. 
17, Changing from One Scale Reading to the Other. 
Owing to the fact that one is often likely to meet a Centigrade 
a8 well as a Fahrenheit temperature, it is well to know how to 
find one when the other is given. In order to find the equiva- 
lent temperature on the scale, it is necessary to bear in mind 
(1) that the fixed points, freezing temperature (0° C. and 32° 
F.) and the boiling temperature of water (100° C. and 212° F.), 
are marked differently ; they do, however, represent exactly the 
same heat intensity, as evidenced by the distance the mercury 
Tises up the tube in expanding from the lower to the higher 
temperature ; (2) that 100 Centigrade degrees represent exactly

the same heat change (rise or fall) as do 180 Fahrenheit degre 
A change in temperature of one Centigrade degree is equal 
a change in temperature of 3 (= 488) of a Fahrenheit d 
gree; a change of one Fahrenheit degree is equal to a chang 
of § (= 488) of a Centigrade degree. : 
By substituting the given temperature in either of the fo} 
lowing formulas, the desired equivalent temperature on the scal 
may be easily calculated: : 
ce af —32) x gh 
F.° = 3 C.° + 32. 
In using these formulas bear in mind that the temperature of 
reference in all cases of changing from one scale reading to tt 
other is the freezing temperature of water. The first step is 
find how many degrees the given temperature is away fro 
freezing. 
18. Uses of Thermometers. Thermometers have mati 
uses in the household other than the common one of indicatim 
the temperature of the air in a room or 0 
of doors. Most up-to-date cooking stov

to indicate the condition for baking al 
roasting different articles of food (Fig. 10)

1g. Clinical Thermometers. One of the most valuable 
uses of the thermometer is in medical practice, as the means 
of determining the degree of bodily temperature. This in all 
normally healthy persons is 98.6° F. Any considerable devia- 
tion from this temperature is an indication of bodily disorder, 
ustially a fever, which is accompanied by a higher temperature 
than normal. About the first thing a physician does when there 
is any indication of feverishness is to take the temperature of 
the patient. This is done with a so-called clinical thermometer 
(Fig. 11), which is different from ordinary ones in three ways: 
first, the scale reads only from 94° to 110° F., with a special 
  Fic. 11.—CLinicAL THERMOMETER 
mark at 98.6° ; second, the bore of the bulb, up and down which 
the mercury moves as it expands and contracts, is very small; 
and third, this bore is particularly narrow near the bulb. The 
Purpose of this last is to prevent the mercury from passing 
0 teadily back into the bulb after it has registered the tem- 
Perature of the patient. Were it not for this, the physician 
Would have to “read the thermometer” when it is in the mouth, 
48 otherwise the mercury in the thermometer would contract 
and register a lower temperature by the time he read it. The 
narrowing in the bore cuts off the mercury column from the 
Mercury on the bulb side, so that it does not return to the bulb 
and the reading may be taken at any time. The mercury must 
be forced back into the bulb by shaking until its level is below 
98°, before another temperature is taken. 
20. Exceptional Expansion of Water. Water forms an 
€Xception to the general rule that the addition of heat to any-
-P-A-G-E-26
| | 18 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
thing causes expansion, and the removal of heat causes cot 
traction. It does follow this rule within certain limits. If itis 
cooled, it will contract until its temperature reaches 4° C. of 
39.2° F. Upon cooling below these temperatures, instead of, 
contracting, it expands until it reaches 0° C. or 32° F., whet 
‘it freezes. Upon heating, the reverse takes place. That this 
exceptional characteristic should apply only to water is one of 
the great provisions of nature. For were it not so, our pond 
and rivers would freeze solid during cold spells in winter and 
the fishes would die. As it is, it is not possible for the water a 
the bottom of a pond to become colder than 4° C. or 39.2° F. 
For a better understanding of this fact, it is necessary 1) 
know the meaning of a new term, density. If a dish is just filled 
by a quart of cold water, which weighs 2 Ibs., and this dish # 
then placed upon the stove, the water in expanding will over 
flow. When the water is hot, there will still be a dish full 
water, but it is hot and weighs less than the original cold wate 
by an amount equal to the weight of the water that has ovet 
flowed. This hot water occupies exactly the same space or vd} 
ume that the cold water did. It is therefore said to be less dens 
than the cold water. Even though the temperature may be 
same, equal volumes of different substances weigh differently 
A quart of mercury weighs more than a quart of water, as d 
also a quart of molasses. If either substance, molasses or 
cury, is poured into water, it sinks to the bottom. 
Tt is thus seen that denser liquids sink and less dense rise 
the top. Such being the case, if a drop in temperature bel 
freezing occurs in the air above a pond, the water at the t 
of the pond is first affected, cools off, contracts, and beco 
denser than the water below it. It naturally sinks to the bott 
pushing up to the top the warmer water below. This water

turn cools, contracts, and sinks. This process, which is a very 
slow one, goes on just as long as the water on top, contracts 
upon cooling, namely, until it is 4° C. or 39.2° F. Further cool- 
ing, however, now brings about an expansion of the water on 
top, which, thus becoming Jess dense than the water below, stays 
on top and continues to cool until it reaches 0° C. or 32° F., 
when it freezes to form a layer of ice on top. Thus the water 
at the bottom does not get below 4° C. or 394° F. 
21. Pressure Effect When Heat Is Applied. Very serious 
explosions of kitchen ranges have occurred when people have 
started fires in stoves at times when the water in the pipes was 
frozen. The reason for this is that when the water in the water- 
back of the stove starts to expand there is no room for this to 
take place, as the pipes are clogged with ice. The tremendous 
Pressure exerted by the water as a result of this expansion bursts 
‘the water-hack, A similar result, more disastrous, occurs in a 
hot water heating system where the water has frozen and a fire 
1s started,

22. Heat Value in Substances. Most people, in buying 
Is like coal, wood, kerosene, and gas, give little thought to 
the amount of Aeat that can be obtained from this fuel, but 
think only of the quantity of material they are getting. Different 
inds of coal vary greatly in their heat-producing values. For 
this reason Many companies that buy large quantities of coal 
Tequire in their contracts that the coal shall give a certain amount 
af heat per ton weight. In some coal there is a large percentage 
of incombustible substance, which forms the ashes in our stoves 
and furnaces, This idea of heat value is a very important one 
also in connection with the food we eat, for food is the fuel 
for the production of body heat. 
23. Heat Exchange—-Warming and Cooling. In order to 
Understand the idea of such a thing as heat quantity, which 
Stot represented by some object, as in the case of the yardstick 
for Measuring cloth, the quart measure for milk, the pound fue
-P-A-G-E-30
22 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
weight for sugar, etc., there is one fundamental principle tha 
must be thoroughly understood. Whenever we feel a desire t 
get warmer, our first thought is to go to a place that is of highe 
temperature, whether it be a warmer room or a fire. The reason 
that the result thus sought is attained is that whenever tw 
substances of different temperature come together, the cool 
one heats while the other cools; the first rises in tempers 
ture while the second undergoes a fall in temperature. Hos 
much heat change from the warmer to the cooler takes pla 
depends upon how great is the difference in temperature betwee 
them, increasing with the greater difference. The heat cann 
be seen or handled. That there is a change at all is evidenc 
only by the change in temperature of the objects. To meas 
heat, then, we must resort to an indirect means, namely, its eff 
on some standard accepted substance. This substance is wate 
and the unit in which the heat is measured is the amount 
will make the temperature of one gram of water one Cent 
grade degree warmer. Such a unit is called a gram calor 
or more simply calorie.    
      
      
    
     
   
   
    
    Since it takes one calorie to raise the temperature of 
gram of water one Centigrade degree, it will take twice as mu 
to raise it 2 Centigrade degrees, namely, 2 calories. If, on 
other hand, 2 g. of water are taken, there is twice as much s 
stance for the heat to be distributed in, and therefore it will 
2 calories to raise 2 g. of water one Centigrade degree. Tor i 
5 g. of water 10 degrees will take 50 calories, and so on. 
number of calories absorbed is equal to the number of grams 
substance times the number of Centigrade degrees change} 
temperature. If the above mentioned weights of water 
cooled, the same respective amounts of heat will be given 0 
Since a Fahrenheit degree is only § of a Centigrade deg!
-P-A-G-E-31
HEAT 23 
it requires only § as many calories when the temperature change 
is measured in terms of Fahrenheit degrees, 
24. Heat Capacity. A pint of water placed in a pan will 
heat much faster than a quart of water placed in another pan, 
if both are put on a hot stove side by side. Also a pound of 
molasses will heat faster than will a pound of water. In these 
two cases we are dealing with a situation that shows us that 
it makes a difference how much of a substance we use, and 
also what the substance is, as to the temperature effect pro- 
duced upon it by equal amounts of heat ; for in both of the above 
cases each of the two pans receives an equal amount of heat 
(number of calories) from the fire. In the first case the weights 
are different, but the substance the same; in the second case the 
Weights are the same, the substances different. The two sub- Stances in each case are said to have a different heat capacity; 
that is, they require different amounts of heat to raise the tem- 
Perature of each one Centigrade degree. 
35 Specific Heat. Substances other than water require 
different amounts of heat to raise one gram of them one Centi- 
Stade degree. The number which represents the number of 
calories required to raise one gram of any substance through one Centigrade degree represents the specific heat of that Substance 
The difference between Specific heat and heat capacity is 
twofold : (1) specific heat is a relation between a given sub- 
Stance and the standard substance water, and is expressed by 
2 number ; (2) specific heat has to do with one gram of a sub- 
Stance, while heat capacity has to do with the whole substance. 
hus one substance may have a different heat capacity from 
another, though of the same material, because different in

different substances differ in their specific heat may be shown by t 
balls of the same weight but of different metals. These are heated 
the same temperature by immersion in hot oil, and then placed on a 
disc of paraffin wax (Fig. 14). The one that gives 
the most heat on cooling will melt the wax most, 
passing through. The others will sink to differt 
depths in the wax, in proportion to their respe 
specific heats. , 
If we place in separate test tubes 20 g. respectit 
of lead shot, iron filings, aluminum filings, and cop 
filings, and heat them in the same beaker of boil 
\. water, they will all in time come to the same tem] 
Fie. 14 ature as the water. If they are now poured into s 
rate beakers, each containing i100 g. of water at 
same temperature, we shall find that the water will beheated up uneq 
the aluminum producing the greatest effect, the iron next, then 
copper, and last the lead. This is because of their different specific h

gains, both finally reaching the same temperature in the process. If 
100 g. of water at 80° C. are mixed with 100 g. at 20° C,, the resulting 
temperature will be halfway between, namely, 50° C. The warm water 
loses 100 X 20 = 2,000 calories, while the cold water gains 100 X 20 = 
2,000 calories. If we use 100 g. at 80° and 50 g. at 20°, the result will 
be a temperature of 60°, since the cold water rises 2° for every degree 
the warm water cools off, as there is only half as much of it. Here 
100 X 20 = 2,000 calories for the hot water and 50 X 40 = 2,000 calories 
for the cold water. 
Tf now we put a piece of hot iron in the cold water, knowing that the iron will give up as much heat as the cold water absorbs, we can 
calculate how much heat one gram of the iron gives up in cooling one 
Centigrade degree. For example, suppose 200 g. of iron at 100° C. are 
Put into 200 g. of water at 15° C., with resulting temperature of 23.6°

32. If we take the temperature of the ice at the time melti 
starts, we find it is 0° C., at which temperature it re f 
during the whole time of melting. Nearly all substances act 
this manner when melting. Some substances, like sealing 4 
and butter, do not remain at the same temperature, but § 
warmer as the melting goes on. The general rule is for a gi 
substance to melt or freeze ata definite temperature u 
ordinary conditions. This temperature is called the melting] 
the freezing point. |

presence of salt causes the ice to melt at a temperature lower 
than its ordinary melting temperature. Likewise the presence 
of salt in water necessitates a lower temperature for the water 
to freeze. Other solids and liquids are also affected by the 
presence of an impurity, which in all cases lowers the melting 
or the freezing temperature. 
34. Alloys. Whenever the plumber wishes to mend a leak- 
ing water pipe he uses lead solder, not lead. This solder is made 
up of one-half lead and one-half tin, and melts at 190° C—a 
much lower temperature than the melting point of lead. Because 
Of this, the lead pipe is not melted by the hot solder. Alloys are’ 
composed of two or more metals in varying proportions. Pieces 
af gold are soldered with an alloy of gold, silver, and copper ; 
Silver articles are soldered with an alloy of silver and copper.

certain metals, alloys of very low melting points maybe obtained ;

36. Automatic Fire Sprinkler, In the automatic sprinkler (Fé 
15) the glass plug Z, held in place by the bar F, H, G, fits tightly int 
the hole of C, thereby preventing water comin 
through C from below. G and H are solderel 
to F by means of a low fusing point allo 
Should a fire start near a water pipe fitted wif 
such a sprinkler, the alloy, when heated 
155° F., melts, and the pressure of the wali 
below is now sufficient to force the pieces 4 
and G away from F. The water, no longé 
held in by the plug EZ, rushes up, strikes ty 
umbrella-like tip J, and is sprayed in all dire! 
tions. In buildings protected by such automa 
sprinklers, pipes are run close under the ceiling 
of the rooms and the sprinklers are placed 
them at frequent intervals. 
37. Effect of Pressure upon Meltisi} 
Point. If we walk along the sidews 
when there has been a light fall of snow, and the temperatt 
is slightly below freezing, a cake of ice frequently forms on 4 
heels of our shoes. It is this piece of ice that sometimes drop 
off the heels after we have been in the house a short time. 
snow has in some way been turned into ice. Now water is 
substance that expands when it freezes, and vice versa, ice cd 
tracts upon melting. If we look upon the melting of ice a 
process of contraction, without considering the heat side of 
matter, it can be seen that if we apply pressure alone to ice 
may bring about the same result that heating will do, namé 
turn ice to water. By the pressure of the heel we are helpi 
the ice (in the form of snow) to contract. As a result, the sud 
melts at a lower temperature than it otherwise would. Whé 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
HEAT 29 
we lift the heel we remove the pressure that caused the contrac- 
tion, and the water at once expands to the solid state, since the 
surrounding air is too cold for it to remain a liquid. _ 
Summing up: (1) most pure crystalline substances melt and 
freeze at definite temperatures; (2) while melting, the solid 
substance stays at the same temperature; (3) the presence of 
an impurity which will dissolve in the substance lowers the 
melting point; (4) the application of préssure to a substance 
that contracts on melting lowers the melting point. Most sub- 
stances expand on melting. Cast iron, type metal, and water,

the purpose of cooling the food there, that is, absorbing the

39. Determination of Heat of Fusion of Ice. This is dow 
in much the same way as is the experiment for determining specific hea’ 
If 10 g. of ice at o° C. are placed in 190 g. of water at 20° C. ani 
stirred, the ice will first melt, forming to g. of ice water. The ice watt 
will then be warmed to 15° C. 
In this case the 190 g. of warm water have given up 190 X (20-15), 
or 950 calories. The 10 g. of ice water, warmed from 0° C. to 13° C 
have absorbed 10 X 15, or 150 calories of these 950 calories, which rea 
950—150, or 800 calories used up in melting 10 g. of ice. One gramd 
ice then takes 800 + 10, or 80 calories, to melt it.

place when ice melts is taken advantage of in the ice creafl 
freezer (Fig. 17), where, will

perature rise, so liquids after being cooled to their freezing pois 
in the process of freezing, give off heat to the surrounding

43. Change of State—Vaporization. All liquids before 
they will burn must be changed. into a gaseous state. This 
explains why the wick of the kerosene lamp or the candle does 
not light at once when a lighted match is held to it. The heat is 
at first used to convert the substance into its gaseous state. This 
gaseous substance, in the case of things which we ordinarily 
find in the solid or liquid state, is called a vapor, as contrasted 
with a gas with which we are more familiar in its gaseous state.* 
Examples of vapors are the gaseous form of gasoline, kerosene, 
alcohol, paraffin, produced by heating them. Examples of true 
Gases are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen., 
Some substances turn to the gaseous state without first be- 
coming liquids, as camphor, naphthalene moth balls; even ice 
does when clothes freeze dry. 
The process of changing a solid or liquid substance into a 
Saseous state is called vaporization. This process may take place 
mn two distinct ways ; for imstance, water in a pan may be made 
‘0 disappeaTGither by setting it aside, when the level slowly 
falls and the water quietly turns to vapor—a process known as 
poration; or the pan may be set on the hot stove, when the 
Water soon heats up, becomes violently agitated, and turns to 
Stam—a process known as boiling. The difference between 
these two processes is that evaporation takes place (1) slowly, 
(2) only on the surface exposed to the air; whereas boiling 
takes place (1) violently and rapidly, (2) throughout the liquid. 
44. Evaporation, If the laundress wishes the wet, wrung-. 
Sut clothes to dry as quickly as possible, she spreads them out 
A" the line ina sunny, windy place, that the water in the clothes

large surface to the air into which the water vapor is to pass, 
(2) to get the clothes as warm as possible, and (3) to have the 
wind carry off the vapor as soon as it forms. Furthermore, if 
a pair of gloves have been washed with gasoline, they will dry 
faster than another pair washed with water, even though the 
two pairs hang side by side. 
Four conditions thus affect evaporation: 
(1) The character of the evaporating liquid. 
(2) Surface exposed. | 
(3) Temperature. 
(4) Removal of vapor when it forms. 
Medicines and perfumery, which are generally alcoholic solt 
tions, must be kept tightly corked to prevent the rapid evaporte 
tion of the alcohol. 
45. Boiling. If a pan of cold water with a thermometet 
in it is placed over a fire and carefully watched, bubbles wil 
soon be seen forming inside on the bottom and on the sides d 
the pan. These bubbles grow larger and finally break aw# 
from the pan, rising to the surface and quietly disappearing 
They consist of air which was dissolved in the water and er 
panded because of the heat. After the air blisters have quilt 
disappeared from the inside surface of the pan, a further ris 
in temperature produces a new phenomenon. Small blist 
appear on the bottom of the dish where the heat is greate# 
These blisters begin as slight mounds which rise and fall. #

noise results from this. Further heating sets the bubbles fr¢

This is due to the fact that with the sudden release of the pres- 
sure there is nothing to prevent the water from boiling violently, 
since it is at a temperature two or three degrees higher than is 
necessary for it to boil ordinarily. This extra heat in it is set 
free all at once, the temperature of the boiling water falling back 
to 212° after the cover is removed. The boiling over goes on 
only while the temperature is dropping, and 
ceases when 212° is reached. 
50. Pressure Cookers. Application of the 
fact that an increased pressure raises the boil- 
ing point of a liquid and the temperature of 
the resulting steam is made in the so-called 
Pressure cooker, in which vegetables are cooked 
‘Na very short time by the use of a cover that 
Sclamped to the kettle. There is a safety valve 
to allow the steam to escape if the pressure 
becomes too great. In this manner a temper- 
ee considerably above 212° F. is obtained (Fig. 20}. In 
Cooking vegetables a high temperature is what is sought.

held near the spout of a teakettle of boiling water. In both

process is called condensation, just the reverse of vaporizatioy 
The cloud near the mouth of the spout of the kettle is cot 
posed of drops of water formed by the cooling and of 
densation of the water vapor, when it meets the cool outside 
54. Distillation. Since different liquids boil at diffe 
temperatures, if two mixed liquids or a solution of a solid i! 
liquid are heated, the one boiling at the lower temperature # 
vaporize first. If this vapor is passed through a tube shat 
kept cool (Fig. 21), the vapor will condense and may be ooh
-P-A-G-E-47
HEAT 39 
lected. This process is known as distillation. If, for instance, 
a dirty solution of salt and water is boiled in the flask D, the 
water vapor must pass through the tube C. This tube is kept 
cool by water passing through an outer tube J, entering at EZ, 
and leaving at L. This cool water causes the vapor to condense 
and flow into beaker R. The salt and dirt remain in the flask, 
since they do not vaporize. 
In the case of boiling hard water in a teakettle, a deposit 
forms in time on the inside of the kettle. This is due to the 
mineral substance that is left behind when some of the water 
is boiled away. Oyster shells are often put in the kettle for this 
deposit to form upon. If the steam formed in the process had 
been condensed, pure water, free from mineral, would have been 
the result, . 
Kerosene and gasoline are obtained from petroleum oil by 
the process of distillation. The gasoline, vaporizing at a lower 
temperature, boils first and its vapor is condensed. Ata higher 
temperature the kerosene boils and its vapor is collected in the 
Same manner. 
Essential oils from flowers, as used in perfumery, are dis- 
tilled at reduced pressure, as in this manner the full odor of the 
flower is preserved. 
55. Singing of Kettle. The explanation of the noise described 
under the process of boiling (Section 45) can now be understood as due 
to the collapsing of the steam bubbles which formed first on the bottom. 
These steam bubbles were hotter than the water just above them, and 
Were therefore condensed when they rose up into it. When they col- 
ised the water dropped down upon the bottom of the dish, producing 
aseties of taps which, acting together, made the metal of the dish vibrate. 
Such a phenomenon occurs when the kettle “sings” or “simmers.” 
56. Heat of Vaporization. Just as ice in melting absorbs 
heat without its temperature rising, so water, in vaporizing, 
whether in the slow process of evaporation or in the rapid

40 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
process of boiling, absorbs heat without an accompanying tem 
perature rise. This absorption is very apparent in the case d 
boiling, for thetemperature remains the same during the proces| 
In evaporation it is not so apparent. Such heat used to chang! 
one gram of any substance from the liquid to the gaseous stat 
is known as heat of vaporization. For water it is 540 calories 
When one gram of the vapor of any substance condenses bad 
to the liquid state, this heat of vaporization, sometimes calle 
heat of condensation, is given out to the surrounding air orf 
objects near, without any accompanying drop in the temperatutt 
of the liquid. 
57. Applications of Heatof Vaporization. Many evident’ 
of this heat of vaporization exist. A wet towel on the line 
much cooler than a dry one hanging beside it. A flower pot wi 
a wet plant in it is cooler than one with dry earth inside. Th 
skin of human beings is cooler than the body temperature, wit 
to the evaporation of perspiration from the skin, which supplié 
the heat necessary for the vaporization to go on. A scald frat 
steam is much worse than one from hot water, owing to 
large amount of heat given up by the steam in condensitf, 
Hot water merely cools off. Steam heat is much more inten 
than is hot water heat for the same reason. 
Alcohol on the forehead, since it evaporates much mo 
rapidly than the perspiration, makes one feel cooler. Gasolitt 
not only makes one’s hands cooler, but, by absorbing the p& 
spiration, as well as itself evaporating, dries the hands. Waté 
standing in a tumbler is cooler than water in a bottle beside # 
because of evaporation. 
58. Experiment to Show the Heat Absorption duriss 
Evaporation, Let us take a small dish of thin copper, placing #9 
a small amount of ether. If we now place the dish on a drop of wa 
on a cork, and blow gently on the ether with a bellows, the dish

soon be frozen to the cork. The ether in evaporating has absorbed the 
heat from the dish and the water so rapidly as to lower the temperature 
of the drop of water below freezing. 
59. Determination of the Heat of Vaporization of Water. 
Suppose 5 g. of steam at 100° is condensed in 195 g. of water at 20° C. 
with a resulting temperature of 35.5° C. The cold water has taken up 
195 X (35.520) == 195 X 15.5 = 3022.5 calories. Of this the 5 g. 
of condensed steam has given out 5 X (100—35.5) = 5 X 64.5 = 322.5 
calories, in cooling down to 35.5 degrees. The balance, 3022.5 — 322.5 = 
2700 calories, has been given up by the § g. of steam in changing from 
steam to water. The heat given out by I g. is 2700 + 5 = 540 calories. 
60, Heat Resulting from the Compression of a Gas. 
When air is pumped into a bicycle tire the pump barrel soon 
becomes quite warm. This heat is not due to friction between 
[> =a) Fic, 22.—Wuen AIR Is Compressep Ir Becomes HzaTED 
the piston and the walls, for the barret does not become warm 
if we move the piston back and forth when the pump is not 
connected with the tire. The heat effect is due to the compres- 
sion of the air. This heat effect may be strikingly shown by 
™eans of the apparatus called a fire syringe (Fig. 22), in which 
tight-fitting piston is pushed rapidly into a cylinder the other 
end of which is air tight. A piece of very inflammable material 
Put into the cup at the end of the piston is set on fire by the 
Steat heat evolved when the piston is pushed rapidly into the 
cylinder, thereby compressing the confined air. 
en a gas is expanded a reverse effect takes place; the gas 
Omes cooler. This may be shown by allowing compressed 
air to pass from a tanle and fall upon a thermometer bulb. If 
€ air in the tank is at room temperature, there will be a drop 
in temperature shown on the thermometer.

61. Cold Storage and Artificial Ice. If gaseous ammonia 
is compressed sufficiently and then cooled, it can be turned into 
a liquid state. During the process, however, large amounts of 
heat both in compression and condensation are evolved. ih 
compressed ammonia is cooled by passing cold water over th 
pipes in which it is to liquefy. The cooled liquid ammonia is 
now allowed to expand again through a valve into larger pips 
that are surrounded by brine (salt water). In the process al 
turning back into the gaseous state, the ammonia absorbs from 
the brine the heat of vaporization of ammonia, which absorp 
tion lowers the temperature of the brine considerably below 
32° F. If pans of water are placed in this cooled brine, cake 
of ice will form. If, on the other hand, the brine is pumpél 
through pipes arranged on the walls of a room, the heat of th 
room will be absorbed in warming the cooled pipes. Articls 
are thus kept cool as in a refrigerator where ice is used. This 
method of artificial refrigeration is known as cold storage, aol 
is used nowadays in preserving eggs, butter, apples, fowl, meas 
and other articles of food that would otherwise become wtf 
for use in a short time. 
By using air which has been liquefied by a process of cot 
pression and cooling, just as the ammonia was treated, tempt 
atures as low as —191° C. are obtained. : 
62. Artificial Skating Rinks. The ice in artificial skatif 
rinks is formed by the use of ammonia as above described, ! 
cold brine being pumped through pipes laid on the ground 
a layer of water over them to the depth of 3 to 6 inches. 
63. “Sunstroke,” Fever, “Colds.” “Sunstroke” is a id 
tion in which the pores of the body fail to work normally, with the 
that there is no perspiration to evaporate and thus cool the skin. 
intense heat of the sun produces too great oppression and unconscio® 
ness may result. In fever, the same failure of the perspiration to      
    
  
-P-A-G-E-51
HEAT 43 
allows the heat to accumulate in the body, and the temperature of the 
body consequently rises. A fever is “broken” by bringing on perspira- 
tion. A “cold” is a form of fever, and is frequently relieved by a hot 
bath (which opens the pores of the skin) followed by a drink of 
hot lemonade, to bring on abundant perspiration. This, in evaporating, 
absorbs heat and relieves the internal congestion.

64. Quantity of Water Vapor in Air—Effect of Temper 
ature. Clothes dry more quickly in the warm kitchen thal 
out of doors. Water on the pavements tends to evaporate mud 
faster on the warm days of summer than on the cool days df 
winter. This is due to the fact that it is much easier for watt 
to evaporate into air as the temperature of the air rises. We ma 
for convenience liken the condition to that of alum in waté 
Much more alum will dissolve in hot than in cold water. If ti 
water has dissolved all the alum it can take up, it is said to

HEAT 45 
saturated. Any cooling of this saturated solution will result 
ina separation from solution of some of the alum, since at the 
lower temperature it takes less to saturate it. In the same way, . 
when all the water vapor possible has been taken up by a given 
volume of air, the air is said to be saturated, and no more water 
will evaporate into it. 
65. Quantity of Water Vapor in Saturated Air. Experi- 
ments have shown that a cubic foot of air saturated with water 
vapot at different temperatures contains the amounts indicated 
in the following table: 
1.32 grains at 20°F. 
2.11 grains at 32°F. 
2.84 grains at 40° F. 
4.07 grains at 50° F. 
5.74 grains at 60° F. 
7.98 grains at 70° F. 
10.93 grains at 80° F. 
14.79 grains at go° F. - 
66, Condensation—-Dew Point. If air is cooled below the 
Saturation point, some of the water vapor condenses to form 
Water, which may be deposited in several ways, such as mist, 
fog, clouds, or dew. Because we are most familiar with the 
deposit that forms on the grass and woodwork, when the air 
near the ground cools off in the night, the temperature at which 
any given air becomes saturated on cooling is called the dew 
point. Scarcely ever, however, is the atmosphere saturated with 
Water vapor. In fact, the quantity of water vapor that is in the 
at varies greatly in different places, and even in the same place 
at different times. The air must generally be cooled consider- 
ably before it reaches the saturation temperature.

67. How the Dew Point May Be Found. Let us take a highly 
polished narrow metal cup (Fig. 23) half full of water. If we now 
lower the temperature of this by adding pieces of ice 
and stirring with a thermometer, a mist will appear o 
the outside shiny surface, if the quantity of water vapor 
in the surrounding air is not too small. The temperature 
at which this mist begins to form is the dew point, as itis 
an indication of the temperature at which the air next 
the cold metal becomes saturated. Sometimes it may bt 
necessary to lower the temperature further by using salt 
and ice if the dew point happens to be very low. 
68. Frost Point. If the quantity of wate 
vapor in the air is very small, there must be a cot 
siderable drop in temperature before the vapot 
condenses. The saturation point may be evé 
  below the freezing point of water. In this caset 
is called the frost point, and instead of the watt 
vapor condensing as liquid water, it deposits in the solid form 
as frost, minute ice particles or snow cloud. ! 
69. Dew, Fog, Mist, Cloud, Rain, Frost, Snow. The di 
ference between dew, fog, mist, cloud, and rain, on the one h 
and frost and snow, on the other hand, lies in the termperatut 
at which the water vapor condensed. If the condensation t 
place at a temperature above freezing, any one of the first grol 
may form; if below freezing, either one of the second gro 
may form. As to whether we get dew, mist, fog, cloud, or f 
depends upon where the condensation takes place and in hi 
great an amount. If on the ground or woodwork, etc., it 
called dew; if in small amount on the dust particles in the 
near the ground, mist; if in larger amount, fog; if high up 
the air, cloud. Inthe case of mist, cloud, and fog, the condens#l 
water appears in very minute particles, so light as to float in tht 
air. If now the condensation on the particles in the cloud it Fic. 23 
     
     
 
-P-A-G-E-55
HEAT : 47 
creases, the cloud becomes darker and the particles so heavy 
as to fall to the ground as rain. If the condensation to form 
the cloud took place below the freezing point, snow results. 
If the temperature at which condensation takes place is above 
the freezing point, and it afterward falls below it, the water 
particles freeze to form sleet. Hail, generally forming in the 
summer time, is thought to be a case of clouds forming high 
in the air and coming in contact with a very cold wind. This 
wind freezes the water particles and swirls them about with 
great force, condensation taking place upon them all the time, 
80 that they become quite large before they are heavy enough to 
drop out of the wind.

yo. Effect of the Heat of Condensation in Preventing 
Frosts. Inasmuch as water vapor, when it condenses, gives out to the 
air the heat that the water absorbed when it evaporated, it is evidet 
that the formation of large quantities of dew or other form of conden 
sation sets free a large amount of heat in the air, thus raising its ter 
perature. If, however, the dew point is below the freezing point, ther 
is danger of frost when the temperature of the air is slightly above tk 
freezing point in the evening, as the air near the ground cools ome 
night. Frost may be predicted when the dew point is known. 
The dew point may be calculated by means of a wet bulb theroue 
eter and the table below. A wet bulb thermometer differs from an oré| 
nary dry bulb thermometer in that the bulb is wrapped in a strip of clot 
the lower end of which dips into water (Fig. 24a). There is contin 
evaporation going on from this cloth, the temperature of which is ths 
lowered. As a result the wet bulb thermometer “reads” lower than th 
dry one. How much lower it will be depends upon how much walt 
vapor there is in the atmosphere. If we multiply the difference betwes 
the readings of the dry and wet bulb thermometers by the number thi} 
in the multiplier column of the table is on the same line with the 
thermometer reading in the first column, the product is the number 
degrees that the dew point is below the dry bulb temperature.

71. Relation between Our Feeling of Comfort and 
Water Vapor in the Air. The quantity of water vapor in 
air has much to do with our feeling of comfort. Our feelit 
in the matter depend upon the tendency of the perspiration 
the body to evaporate and thus cool us off. The human 
may be likened to a plant growing in a flower pot. Part of
-P-A-G-E-57
HEAT 49 
water poured on the earth of the plant will pass out through 
the pores of the pot and there evaporate, making the pot colder 
than it would otherwise be. The earth around the plant inside 
the pot, however, is not affected to any considerable degree 
by this cooling of the outside. In the same way, the human body 
is covered by a layer of skin, through the pores of which the. 
petspiration passes out to the surface, there to evaporate. The 
skin, as a result, is much cooler than the body inside; how much 
cooler depends upon how fast the perspiration evaporates. Now 
the more water vapor there is in the air the less is the tendency 
of the perspiration to evaporate, But if that same air is heated, 
the perspiration will evaporate faster, since warm air can take 
up more water vapor than can cool air. As a result we may feel 
cooler at the higher temperature. The actual quantity (num- 
ber of grains) of water vapor in a given volume of air (1 cu. ft.) 
'scalled the humidity of the air. Now the more nearly saturated 
any given air is, the less additional water vapor will it take up. 
Air that may be nearly saturated at one temperature will be much 
below saturation at a higher temperature. The ratio between 
the amount of water vapor there is in the air and the amount 
there would be if the air is saturated is called the relative 
humidity, Raising the temperature of air does not change the 
humidity, provided there has been no chance for more water 
Vapor to get into the air. Raising the temperature does, how- 
‘ver, change the relative humidity, making it lower. For ex- 
ample, if t cu. ft. of air at 60° F. contains 2.37 gr. of water vapor, 
is ahout two-fifths saturated } since to be saturated it must 
Contain 5.74 gr. to the cubic foot. Its humidity is 2.37 gr. per 
Cubic foot. Its relative humidity is 2.37-~-5.74=41.3%. This 
arwhen heated to 80° F. will still contain 2.37 gr.,* but will be 
about one-fifth saturated ; since to be saturated at 80° F. it must 
" Tnveality, owing to the expansion of the air, there is a little less than 2.37 gr. to the cu. ft,
-P-A-G-E-58
50 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS | 
contain 10.93 gr. Its humidity is as before, 2.37 gr. per cubic 
foot, while its relative humidity is 2.37 + 10.93 or 21.6%. | 
There are two extremes of comfort in regard to water vapor 
in the air. Air with too low relative humidity causes too rapid 
evaporation of perspiration, with resulting dryness of the skin 
and the nostrils. Air with too high relative humidity cause 
oppression by too little evaporation, and one feels sticky ant 
damp. The normal condition is 60% relative humidity. 
By means of the hygrodeik (Fig. 24b), the relative humidity 
and the dew point may be quickly determined by means ofa 
diagram that lies between the two thermometers. 
72. “Drying” Air. Since raising the temperature lowers 
the relative humidity, thereby increasing the tendency of watet 
to evaporate into it, warming air is said to “dry” it. What i 
really meant is that it makes the air feel dry ; for no water vapd 
has been driven out of the air by heating, as would have af 
the case to dry anything. Ona “damp” day clothes will not 
so well as on a day when there is less relative humidity. Bring 
ing the clothes into the hot kitchen will, however, hasten tht 
drying on such a day. Mists that are in the air and obscutt 
the sun in the early morning are said to “burn away.” The hett 
from the sun warms the air, thus making it possible for itt 
take up the mist. Water vapor, both at a low temperature and 
as steam, is invisible and the sun’s rays pass readily through 
while water particles obstruct the rays. 
73. “Too Dry” Air in Many Houses. This so-called 
ing of air is a serious trouble in buildings that are heated # 
well as ventilated by hot air, whether it be by a furnace in# 
dwelling house or by a fan in large buildings, such as schoo 
houses or theaters.. In cases where normal air is taken in fro 
outside, heated and passed through the rooms where it is to be

74. Sources of Heat. As mentioned before, besides the k 
generated in the body to keep us alive, heat is needed to catty 
on the various affairs of life, such as cooking, warming oo 
houses, running engines, etc. The commonest source of heat 
the sun, but this has very little direct use other than wart 
our bodies. For other purposes we resort to the heat obtai 
from burning such substances as wood, coal, oil, gas, and, 3 
our atitomobiles and flying machines, gasoline. The treal

In olden times heat to start fires was obtained by rotating 2™

the fire on the hearth was kept going continuously, if possible, 
) after it was once started. Today with our matches, which we . 
_ set on fire through friction, we little think of the difficulty of 
former times. Nowadays use is 
made of electricity as well as of 
gas as a source both of heat and 
of light. It furnishes a convenient 
means of heating, for it is clean, 
does not use up the oxygen of the 
air, and does not contaminate the 
air with unhealthful gases.

will pass up B even with thebox and 4 removed, 
as there is cold air on all sides of the candle. 
When we light an ordinary lamp wick 
(Fig. 29) we get a dim, smoky flame until the 
chimney is put in place. The light then becomes 
clear and bright. In this case the air inside the 
chimney has been heated and forced upwards 
by the colder air outside the base of the burner.

air coming to the flame in greater quantity than beforé

of more perfect combustion. -
-P-A-G-E-63

55 
In the fireplaces of our houses the heat from the fire makes 
the air in the chimney expand, and thus become less dense. The 
denser cooler air in the room outside the 
fireplace pushes the warm air up the chim- 
ney, thus creating a draft, constantly re- 
newing the supply of fresh air to the fire, 
and making it burn better. : 
In ventilating a room it is better to open 
the windows at the top and bottom, so as 
toallow for an inlet and an outlet (Fig. 30). 
77. Circulation of Air in Kitchen 
Stoves. In the kitchen range there are 
several regulating dampers. The fire box _ 
has an under and an upper damper, to 
Tegulate the fire. With the under one 
opened and the upper one closed, the draft 
acts through the fire to make it burn faster.

HEAT 57 
The flue may be too large, so that the air in it does not get heated 
fast enough. 
There may not be sufficient chance for air to get into the room 
and up the chimney. 
There may be two chimneys of different heights in adjoining 
rooms (compare Fig. 28), so that when a fire is burning at the 
bottom of one it may be difficult to start a fire in the other, 
which has been acting as a course for the cold air downwards. 
The wind, owing to walls or roofs of houses near by, may blow 
. down the chimney (Fig. 32). 
79. Refrigerator. In the refrigerator (Fig. 33) the ice is 
always placed near the top, so that the cold air in falling will force the warm air below 
up to the top, thereby bring-

with the food. The warm 
air, when cooled by the ice 
above, in turn falls.

cellar. The heat from this is transferred, as needed, to the ét 
ferent rooms of the house. The three methods by which 4 
transference is carried out are by the use of hot air, of Md 
water, and of steam. The last of these, the steam heating 9*|

are fastened to the body of the pot with glass or ivory diss 
and chafing dish handles are made of wood or horn, The fat 
that asbestos is an insulator makes it of great use for coveri 
steam pipes to keep them from cooling as steam passes throvgt 
them to the radiators in thedifferent rooms. The walls of reftig- 
erators (Fig. 42) are made up of successive layers of insulatil? 
material. Storm windows are put on in winter to furnist? 
layer of confined air between the warm room and the outst 
cold air. Our fireless cookers utilize the poor conductivity 
air in that the hot food is shut up in air-tight compartmet \

(Fig. 43). The heat put into the food cannot easily escape, so 
the cooking goes on, aided sometimes by the heat from hot 
soapstone slabs put above and below the vessel containing the 
food. The modern vacuum bottle 
(Fig. 44) that keeps liquids either 
hot or cold, as may be desired, is based 
on the fact that the space between the 
imer and outer bottle has no air in it. 
Avacuum, which is a space unoccupied 
byany solid, liquid or gas, is even better

heat enters the hand only from the spot touched. The two sensa 
tions of heat resulting will be quite different on this account. 
Water may be boiled in a paper dish held over a low bunse 
flame without the paper burning. Here we have a most striking 
example of the fact that water cannot be heated in an open dist 
much above 100° C. The paper being thin conducts the hea 
readily through to the water. The paper cannot become hotter 
than the water inside, and as the kindling temperature. of papet 
is much above 100° C., it is impossible to set it on fire as long 
as there is water over the bottom of the dish. This cannot be 
done with a cardboard box, as heat is not conducted readily 
enough through the thick cardboard. 
go. Radiation. We have thus far learned that heat may be 
transferred by cogyection, in which the heat is carried upwards; 
and by conduction, dh which the heat is transmitted from the 
warmer to the colder part of an object. Also we have learned 
that air is a very poor conductor ‘of heat. Neither of thes 
methods then will explain how our hand feels hot if held beneath 
a hot object. The manner in which heat shows its presence 
this case is known as radiation. Since it is neither conductiot 
nor convection, this radiation must take place in a mediw™ 
different from that in the other two cases. We get the bene 
of the heat of the sun, as we all realize every day of out lives 
Now the sun is some 93,000,000 miles away, and we know {rot 
the experience of men who have gone high up in balloons that 
the air becomes rarer and rarer the higher they go. Dependit 
on this, it is calculated that our atmosphere extends abott 
50 miles above the earth. From the upper limit of the atm 
phere to the sun there is said to be a vacuum. Therefore a1 
medium has to be considered through which the sun’s heat oa 
travel. To this is given the name of radiant ether, or mo —
-P-A-G-E-77
HEAT 69 
simply, ether. It is called radiant because it is the means of 
transmitting the so-called radiant energy, a name given to the 
energy of heat and light. This ether is supposed to be every- 
where, whether or not air is present. 
gt. Molecular Composition of Substances and Molecular 
Theory of Heat. For a better understanding of this radiant 
‘energy, which we must now consider, an understanding of what 
goes to make up substances and what is happening to them is 
necessary. According to the present accepted theory, substances 
are made up of molecules, which are very small particles, so 
small that they cannot be seen with the most powerful micro- 
scope known. Between these molecules are spaces. There are 
many kinds of molecules, but those of any given kind of sub- 
Stance are all alike; and it is by the combined action of all the 
molecules of the same kind that we are able to say what each 
Molecule is doing. The molecules are continually moving back 
and forth in a vibratory manner, hitting one another and 
alo hitting molecules of another sort at the surface of the 
dbject. There is a certain amount of friction between these 
molecules as they rub or hit against one another, and this results 
in the internal heat of the object. The faster the molecules 
Vibrate the greater becomes the friction and the higher the 
temperature of the substance. Heat may thus be said to be due 
to the energy of vibration of the molecules. 
(92 Waves. If we throw a stone or other object upon the 
Wet surface of a pool or pond, ripples or waves form on the 
Water and spread out in all directions on the surface (Fig. 45, 
Tontispiece). These form a series of concentric circles which 
ome larger and larger until they finally strike the shore with 
Tore or less force. Any disturbance of still water produces 
Such an effect. Now the ether is just as susceptible as is
-P-A-G-E-78
7O HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
water of having waves set up in it when it is disturbed. The 
main difference is that it requires a different sort of disturbance, 
Furthermore, when once started, the waves pass in every direc- 
tion from the point of disturbance outwards, not in concentric 
circles, but in concentric hollow spheres. Molecular vibration 
is the disturbance that starts these ether waves, which depend 
for their frequency on the rapidity of the molecular vibration 
The more rapidly the waves form, the shorter they are; and 
vice versa, long waves are due to a disturbance from a less rapid | 
molecular vibration. 
93- Heat and Light Both Produced by Molecular Vibre 
tion, Differing in Degree. If we hold a small piece of iron in 
a hot flame, at first there is no perceptible change in appea™ 
ance, though the molecules are being set in more rapid vibration. 
We are aware, however, that the iron is becoming hotter by the 
fact that it feels warmer if held a short distance from the fact 
On further heating, a condition is reached at which the iro 
begins to take on a dull red color, followed by a bright red, and 
finally reaches a white heat. Another of our senses, sight, ha’ 
come into use, and we say the iron gives off both heat and light 
Both these conditions have been produced by putting heat into 
i the iron, thereby causing an increased vibration of the mole 
cules. Furthermore, the effect of this increased vibration s 
produced upon the skin and eyes nearly equally in every dire 
tion from the hot object. The action has taken place through 
the ether and the cause has been radiant energy. Thus hed 
and light are closely connected, differing largely in degree of 
vibration of the molecules and in the effect of the waves ufo! 
our senses. 
Naturally the waves set up in the ether by the slower vib 
tions are longer, and we say that heat waves are the longer etht
-P-A-G-E-79
HEAT 71 
waves; while the waves produced by the faster vibrations are 
short, thus giving us short ether waves, or light waves. Both 
are waves originating in radiant energy. 
Just as our bodies react differently to the two kinds of waves 
(long and short), so do other substances react differently to 
them, and we find that light waves will produce many effects 
other than those produced by heat waves.

94. Sources of Light. If we turn our attention to the vat 
ous sources of light, we find that they are the same as thos’ 
from which we derive heat. The sun is our natural souret; 
artificially we have the burning of wax, oil, gas, and the effed 
produced by the electric current upon the carbon and tungsteal 
filaments in the incande 
cent lamps, and upon tit 
carbon rods in the at 
lamps. Such sources of 
light are called Luminowt 
objects. Objects which 
not emit light are called 
non-luminous; but up 
receiving light waves fa 
luminous objects these ® 
come illuminated.

moving at any particular point is called a ray, and for con- 
venience the term ray of light is frequently used instead of 
wave of light, which is what is, really referred to. Thus we 
speak of the sun’s rays falling upon objects about us. 
96. Opaque, Translucent, and Transparent Objects. 
There are some things through which light waves will not pass 
atall. Metals and wood in thick layers are examples of such 
| dbjects, which are called opaque. Some substantes allow light 
waves to pass through and illuminate objects on the other side, 
but the objects cannot be seen through them. To this class 
belong paper, ground glass, milk; all of which are called trans- 
lucent. Finally, through such substances as clear glass, water, 
air, objects on the other side can be readily seen. This class of 
substances is called transparent. 
EFFECTS PRODUCED BY OBJECTS UPON 
LIGHT WAVES : 
97. Whenever light waves encounter any medium other than 
tther, any one of three things can happen to them: they may be 
raxsmitied, as by glass; reflected, as from mirrors; absorbed, 
% by dark walls in rooms. Generally two or more of these 
effects take place together. We know that sunlight falling upon 
glass window lights up the room within; but at the same time 
it obscures the interior of the room from a person outside. The 
mated glare dazzles his eyes.- It is because .of the reflected 
wets that one cannot see out of the window at night when there 
a light i inthe room. That the color ofthe wall paper makes 
piniderable difference as to how brilliantly a room is lighted 
¥alamp is well known (Fig. 49). 
98. Intensity of Light. As we move away from a light

78 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
source, such as a gas flame, the brightness of illumination af 
a book decreases rapidly. This is because a smaller portion of 
the light waves is 
falling upon th 
book. The intensity 
of light depends 
upon what part of 
the waves is inter 
cepted. Let us com

tion of the wave

upon the book. At C, three times as far away, only one-ninth 
of the light falls upon it. From the above result we say that 
the intensity of light diminishes as the square of the distance 
from the source. Many people do not realize this, and attempt 
toread with the light too far away. Much eyestrain results from 
this abuse of the eyes. 
We speak of various sources of light as being of so many

by five the time in seconds that elapses between seeing the light- 
ning flash and hearing the thunder, we can tell how many miles 
away the lightning is. 
z00. Shadows. As we walk along when the sun is shining, 
we notice what we call our shadow upon the sidewalk. This 
shadow is due to the fact that the light waves have been stopped 
by the body, which is opaque. Now not only have they been 
cut off from the dark part on the ground, but from all the space 
included between it and our body. This space is called the rea 
shadow of the body. We cannot see that the light waves att 
absent from this space unless we hold some object there. The 
formation of shadows necessitates our having an unobstructed 
space between us and the light when we read at night. That 
we can see the object at all when it is in shadow we shall later 
find is due to light waves 
reflected from other objects 
near at hand. ¢

there is some distance from the top to the bottom of the flame. 
We may look upon the flame as made up of many tiny points 
of light from each of which rays 
diverge (Fig. 54). 
Taking the top particle (Fig. 55a), 
a shadow represented in section by 
4B CD will form, and if it were the 
only source, CD would represent total 
darkness on the wall. Light waves 
which pass from the bottom particle 
done would give a similar dark area,

light waves together, we shall get a condition represented by 
Figure 55, in which the portion A B F C is getting no light 
Waves, while 4 C E and B F D are getting waves from part but 
not from all of the flame. 
As a result we have a 
dark spot bordered by

from total darkness to

We call the central dark 
-portion the wmbra and 
the shaded portion the 
penumbra. For this rea-

101. Phases of the 
Moon. The formation 
of shadows plays a con- 
spicuous part in our 
lives in the matter, of 
eclipses, both of the 
sun and of the moon 
To understand this we 
must bear in mind that 
the earth is moving in nearly a circle around the sun, taking 
a year to do it. At the same time the earth rotates on its axis, 
giving us day and night. Around the earth the moon moves 
once a month. All the time the half of the earth or of the moot 
on the side toward the 
sun is illuminated. This 
results in day on. the 
earth. -How the moon 
will look to us depends 
on where it is in rela- 
tion to the earth (see 
Fig. 57). As a result 
we get the phases of the 
moon during the differ- 
ent parts of the month.

REFLECTION

tither of silvered glass or polished metal in the sunlight that 
Shines into a room, we find that the light disappears from the 
Pot where the mirror’s shadow falls and appears at another spot
-P-A-G-E-96
&8& HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
which is now illuminated more brightly than before. The res 
of the room remains practically unchanged. If, however, we 
use a piece of white rough paper, instead of a mirror, we find 
that the room becomes slightly brighter. In both cases the light | 
waves have been affected, though differently. In the first case, 
by turning the mirror we can shift the point of illumination 
We cannot do so with the paper. There has been a regular effect 
produced by the mirror. The rays have not been scattered, ox

the spot of light is of nearly the same size as the outline of the 
mirror’s shadow. In the second case, the rays have been se 
rated and scattered. In both cases, reflection has taken plate: 
with the’ smooth mirror there -has been regular and with the 
rough paper there has been irregular or diffuse reflection 
Figure 59a represents regular reflection and Figure 59) reff 
sents irregular reflection. The relation of the rays to each othe | 
when reflected from a mirror is the same as before they str 
the mirror. This is not so in the case of rough paper. : 
looking at a mirror we see things in the mirror, not the mit 
when looking at the paper we see the paper itself. This majy

waves from these come to a mirror, they continue, only ina 
different direction, and we see the light just as if we were look- 
ing straight at it. In the case of the paper each point on the 
rough surface, because of irregular reflection, becomes, as it 
were, a new source of light, sending off rays in all directions, 
so that when we look at the paper we see these separate points 
104. Value of Diffuse Reflection. Diffuse reflection from 
walls of buildings and other objects produces a blending of the 
light waves, and makes it possible to see in places upon which 
no direct light waves fall. The smoother a surface is, the more 
difficult it is to see it. For this reason books printed on highly 
polished paper are bad for the eyes because the giare of the light 
regularly reflected from the polished surface makes it difficult 
to see the print. Because newspapers are printed on rough 
porous paper, it is not so tiring to read them. The mellownes: 
of artificial light first reflected to the ceiling and there diffused 
through the room is very noticeable (Fig. 60). Also the use of 
the opalescent and ground glass 
globes produces a softer, mot 
agreeable light.

Fic. 61.—REFLECTION OF is due to the fact that light ra

rmal always lies between the incident and the reflected rays. 
le angle formed by the incident ray and the normal is called 
eangle of incidence, and the angle formed by the reflected 
y and the normal is called the angle of reflection. The angle 
{incidence and of reflection are always equal, an increase in 
ie causing a corresponding increase in the other. 
The same law of reflection holds for all kinds of surfaces, 
hether mirrors or not, but it brings about different results in 
ferent cases. 
Note—Rays really pass in all directions from the object to 
he mirror ; but in representing what takes place, only the rays 
town are considered. . 
106. Kinds of Mirrors. Mirrors are of two types, plane 
(fat) and’ curved, The curved mirrors may be concave or 
‘otvex; either a portion of the inside or outside surface of.a 
bellow cylinder or of a hollow sphere, giving us cylindrical 
iver and concave, and spherical convex and concave mirrors. 
Care all familiar with the plane, and many are familiar with 
Concave spherical mirrors. 
Concave spherical mirrors are of great value in medicine 
“reflecting light upon the teetli, into the throat, and into the 
&. They are used in searchlights and for reflectors of lights 
“Yooms, The images seen in the inside and outside of spoon 
and in the outside of silver pitchers are examples of 
tion from curved mirrors. 
"Vex spherical mirrors were formerly used to a great 
sent as hall mirrors, and are now used on automobiles to see 
toad behind without turning the head. 
"07. Parallel Rays. While rays from a source of light
-P-A-G-E-100
92 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
diverge in all directions, the amount of divergence of thos 
striking a given area depends upon how far from the soure 
we are considering them. For example, in Figure 62 the ray 
passing through the successive openings of the cards J, IJ, I 
diverge least in //I, the one farthest from the light source. | 
we go far enough from the source, those passing through th 
same sized opening will be more nearly parallel. Now the su 
is so far away from us that we consider the rays from it a 
  Fig. 62.—THE Rays THROUGH III arE More NEARLY 
PARALLEL THAN THROUGH I 
    
    
    
  parallel. We shall see later that it is possible to change 
parallel rays into parallel rays by artificial means. : 
If a series of parallel rays strike a plane mirror (Fig. 
they will be reflected parallel, since the incident rays, as 
as the normals, are parallel. If such a series strike a cone 
mirror (Fig. 67) they will be converging (coming to 
on reflection, and in the case of a convex mirror they 
diverging (separating) on reflection. The normals on ¢ 
mirrors are the radii of the curves.

ton of these gives what

in a line drawn from a point 
perpendicular to the mirror. 
The image of the object is re- 
versed, either from right to left 
or upside down, and is the same 
size as the object (Fig. 64). 
A simple experiment to show the 
location of the image formed by a 
plane mirror is to set a lighted candle 
before a piece of glass placed verti- 
cally. If a tumbler is set so that the 
center of its base is as far behind 
the glass as the candle is in front, 
it will look as if there were a candle 
burning inthe middle of the tumbler.

In a convex mirror we also get a virtual image, since Fi 
rays, on reflection, diverge. This image, however, is smaller 
than the object (Fig. 65). |

“ch a pencil of rays will make less angles of incidence than 
the parallel rays of Figure 67. They will not, therefore,       Fic. 68

be bent inwards so much, and will cross or focus at a poitt 
farther from the mirror, somewhere between the principal 
focus and the center of curvature. (Note.—The reflected ray 
must be on.the other side of the radius.) ° 
If the light is brought up to the center of curvature, al 
rays will strike the mirror perpendicularly, and therefore be 
reflected straight back, focusing at the center from which they 
started. Should the light be brought nearer the mirror, between 
the center of curvature and the principal focus, the reflec 
rays will pass outside of the radii and the focus will be fal 
away than the center of curvature. When the light is on 
principal focus, the rays on reflection will be parallel and n 
focus. If, finally, the light is brought closer to the mirror, 
rays on reflection will diverge and seem to come from a P 
behind the mirror, thus forming an unreal or virtual image. 
Thus far we have dealt with a single point of light. If , 
now desire to locate the image of an object we locate the images 
of the two extreme 
points of the object by 
the use of two rays, the 
focus of which deter 
mines the focus of al 
rays from that point of 
light. These two 7/8 
are, one that is paral 
to the principal a8 
and one that passe 
through the center di 
curvature. The first passes through the principal focus on 
reflection, and the second is reflected straight back. In each of 
Figures 69 and 70 the image of one point is thus located; i.

image of any other point may be found in the same manner. . 
An examination of these shows that as long as the object is 
beyond the center of curvature the image will form between, 
the center of curvature and principal focus, inverted, real and

the image will be at S. Thus object and image are interchange- 
able, and the two foci are called conjugate foci.

REFRACTION 
110. Refraction of Light Waves. That glasses are trouble- 
sotne to persons when they first wear them can he realized only 
by those so unfortunate as to need eye correction. When look- 
ing sidewise near the edge, they see things double. This is due 
to the fact that unless light rays strike the surface of the glass 
perpendicularly they do not continue straight on into the glass, 
  Fic. 72 
  but are bent. Another example of this is in the bevel of the 
mirror. When we stand directly in front of the bevel we se 
a part of our image double, though we see a single image if we | 
move to where the glass is not beveled. ( 
Figure 72 shows the effect produced upon light rays as they 
strike glass at different angles. Such an effect is known a 
refraction. The amount that a ray is bent or refracted out of 
its course depends upon what medium it passes from and into 
what it passes, and upon how great an angle it forms with the | 
surface at the point where the ray enters the second substance. 
In Figure 73, J O represents the incident ray and O R the 
. refracted ray. I O P is the angle of incidence, and C O Rte | 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
LIGHT ror 
angle of refraction. Angle R O D represents the amount the ray 
is refracted from its otherwise straight path. This angle is 
called the angle of deviation. When a ray passes into a denser 
| medium, as from air to glass, it is refracted towards the normal ‘ 
dense medium, as from glass to air, it is bent away from the 
  Fic. 73 
rommal erected at the point where it leaves the denser medium. 
The normal always lies between the incident and the refracted 
"ys. Figure 74 shows the course of a ray of light through a

of incidence, while c d and angle ht c d are the refracted ray and 
the angle of refraction. Since the two perpendiculars are 
- parallel, the ray, on coming out of the glass, is bent back just 
as much as it was bent 
out of its course upon 
entering. It is shifted, but 
is parallel to the path in 
which it was passing be 
fore it entered.

looks much higher up that 
the table top on which it 
rests, if it is looked 
at from above. Water 
always looks shallower 
than itis. A stick thrust into water seems sharply bent upwards. 
A ray of light that in the water passes straight towards the ey 
is bent to take a path below the eye when it emerges into the 
air. A coin lying on the bottom of a glass dish, seen only 
through the side, becomes visible over the side as well as through | 
it when water is poured into the dish (Fig. 75). | 
Owing to the fact that the earth’s atmosphere is a medium 
different from the ether outside of it, light waves from tle 
sun, on entering it, are refracted towards the earth (Fig. 76): 
As a result we see the sunrise really before the sun is above tht | 
horizon, and the sun seems to set a little later than it really dot: 7 
Furthermore, the reflection of the sunlight from the particles 
in the atmosphere makes the shutting off of the sunlight less 
abrupt, giving us twilight. In the same way we get the effet

of the sunlight in the morning before the sun appears. This 
effect we call daw. 
112. Cause of Refraction. The reason that refraction takes 
place whenever light waves pass from one medium into another 
is that they move with different velocity in different media.

The greater the difference there is between the velocities of

the distance the wave moves in successive equal time intervals. 
If R O, the direction in which the wave moves, is perpendicular to 
the glass, then ail portions of the wave will strike the surface b O a and 
enter the glass at the same time. The wave will move with less speed 
in the glass, but it will continue in the same direction. All parts of the 
wave will reach the other surface and pass from the glass into the air 
at the same instant. The speed will now increase, but the direction in 
which the wave moves will be the same.

and the angle at which it takes place is called the critical angh 
for that substance. The critical angle for light passing from 
water into air is 48.5° ; in the case of diamond into air it is 24°: 
from crown glass into air it is 42°. Such reflection is the mot

bent so much out of their original path, because they strike the 
first surface at a less angle of incidence than do the upper and 
lower ones, and furthermore the sides of these prisms are more 
nearly parallel. | 
Should we increase indefinitely the number of prisms, each 
one slightly different from the next, we should get on each side 
a surface that is curved (Fig. 85c). Such a piece of glass is 
  Fic, 85¢ 
known as a lens, which is a transparent medium composed of 
least one curved surface and is of different thickness at the 
edges and center. In most cases the surfaces are spherical. 
If we should take two prisms with apices together the rays 
will be bent away from each other. Increasing the number of 
prisms in this case will give us a lens that makes the rays 
diverge (Fig. 86). 
116. Spherical Lenses. Lenses may be divided into tw0 
different types, those that are thicker at the center than at the 
edges, known as convex ; and those that are thinner at the cente 
known as concave, They are called converging and diverging 
lenses because of the effect they tend to produce upon rays of

light passing through them. Convex lenses produce converging 
effects and concave lenses produce diverging effects. Each

shown in Figure 87. :

112 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
axis. Other axes are called secondary. In case there are two 
curved surfaces, the principal axis passes through the center of 
the other curve. In this case there are two principal foci, each 
between the optical center and the center of curvature near 
the latter. Rays parallel to the principal axis, when passing 
through the lens, are refracted, converge and pass through 
the principal focus on the other side (Fig. 89a). In the case 
of a concave lens such rays are refracted, diverge, and seem to 
come from the principal focus on the side from which they

entered the lens (Fig. 89b). Concave lenses never form real 
images, and they are therefore used only in connection with 
convex lenses, in order to diminish the converging effect of the 
latter. The distance from the optical center to the principal | 
{ 
| 
  focus is called the focal length of the lens. 
The same results are obtained with convex lenses a5 with 
concave mirrors, as far as the kind and size of the image is ©” 
- cerned. The difference lies in the fact that with lenses the light 
passes through, and refraction, instead of reflection, is te | 
phenomenon. Therefore real images are on the other side | 
the lens from the object, and unreal images are on the same 
side as the object. Figure go represents the manner in which the
-P-A-G-E-121
LIGHT 113 
positions of the images are located. Here the secondary axis 
is through the center of the lens. Two facts must be borne in 
mind: first, a ray of light passing parallel to the principal axis 
will be refracted toward the axis when it enters the glass, and 
  Fic. 893.—Concave LENS 
ieth et refracted toward the axis when it emerges on the 
a te Side, finally passing through the principal focus; second, 
ioe ts through the optical center will be unchanged in 
00 after passing through. This will, however, be slightly shi : ° 7 
| hed, just as a ray passing through a parallel-sided piece of
-P-A-G-E-122
114 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
glass is shifted. For all purposes of construction, however, 
it is sufficient to consider the ray as passing through the lens 
unchanged. Where two such rays cross we get the image of 
the point from which they originated. By locating the image 
of the two extreme points of the object we can locate all inter- 
vening points by joining these two images. 
Now, inasmuch as the farther off an object is, the more nearly 
parallel are the rays from it, the image of such an object will 
be near the principal focus of a convex Jens. As the object is 
brought nearer the lens, the image will form farther away. Ia 
Figures 90 a, b, c, the ray A I parallel to the principal axis will 
in each case pass through the principal focus in the same direc- 
tion after leaving the lens. This will be the same no matter 
how near the object is. The secondary ray from A through 
the optical center of the lens will, however, slant downwards 
more, the nearer the object gets to the lens. The two rays wil 
thus meet farther out on the other side of the lens, as the light 
is brought up to the lens. When the light is between the pr 
cipal focus and the lens, the two refracted rays diverge and 
never come to a focus. To a person looking through the lens 
they seem to come from a point on the same side of the lens 
the light, but farther back. By construction and by experiment 
it may be shown that with the object more than twice as fat 
away as the principal focus, the image is on the other side of 
the lens, between the principal focus and a point twice as fat 
away, real, inverted, and smaller than the object (Fig. goa). It 
the object is between the principal focus and a point twice as fat 
away, the character of the image is just the reverse of the oné 
above, as regards location and size, but is still real and inverted 
(Fig. gob). Tf, finally, the object is between the lens and its 
principal focus, the result is a virtual, upright, magnified imag’

located on the same side of the lens as the object, but farther 
‘Way (Fig. goc). In the reading lens, or simple magnifying

Fig. 91), we find an application of the last case.

118. Camera. In the camera (Fig. 92), as used ordinarily 
to secure small pictures of objects, we have an example of the 
formation of the image of an object more than twice as far away 
as the principal focus. The image obtained on the screen is real, 
inverted, and smaller than the object, and lies between the prin-

  cipal focus and a point twice as far away from the lens. The 
purpose of the bellows on the camera is to keep out all light 
other than that passing through the leris, so as not to affect the 
sensitized plate or film. The bellows serves another function. 
Inasmuch as the camera is to be used for taking pictures of 
objects sometimes near and sometimes far away, the distance | 
between the lens and plate (or film) must be changed if we wish | 
clear images. This distance will be greater for near objects than 
for distant ones. The bellows makes it possible to change the 
distance easily. In order that the photographer may be sure of 
getting a clear image, many cameras are provided with a ground 
glass screen upon which the image may be examined. |

  Fic, 92.—CAMERA AND PLATE HOLDER WITH PLATE 
Sound glass, A plate holder containing a sensitized plate is 
then inserted in place of the ground glass, and the opening in 
the lens is closed either by acap ora shutter. The slide is drawn 
from the plate holder and the plate exposed by opening the 
Stutter of the lens or removing the cap. In some cameras 
(kodaks) a film is used, on which a number of exposures may 
| taken in succession. In this case there is no opportunity to 
“t if the image of the object is clear, as the film cannot be 
Femoved until all the exposures are made. A scale upon the 
€ board must be used in setting the lens at the proper place. 
As the distance of the object must be estimated, one cannot be
-P-A-G-E-126
118 HOUSEHOLD PILYSICS 
sure that the lens is set at the proper distance from the film 
to give a clear image. 
The sensitive emulsion on the plate is such that where light 
falls upon it a chemical change takes place. The plate is devel- 
oped in a dark room under ruby (dark red) light, which does 
not affect the emulsion. In the process of developing and fixing, 
those parts of the plate that were affected most by the light 
become nearly black. These represent the high lights of the 
object, such as the sky and white parts. The parts least affected 
are nearly transparent. These represent the shadows and dark 
parts of the object. Because the white parts are shown as black 
and the black objects as transparent, the plate after development 
is called a negative (Fig. 930). { 
Printing from the Negative, To make a picture from the | 
negative, a sheet of sensitized paper or another sensitive plate 
is placed against the emulsion side of the negative and light is 
allowed to fall upon it. Where this is transparent, light gets ! 
  through to the sensitive surface; where the negative is black, 
no light gets through. This printed plate or paper, when devel 
oped, gives the reverse of the negative, called the positive 
(Fig. 93b). If it is on paper, it is called a photograph; if 0 
glass, it is called a transparency or lantern slide. Films that are 
used in moving picture machines (see Section 129) are positives: 
120. Human Eye. In the human eye (ig. 94) we havea 
living camera with which pictures are being continually take f 
as it were, and transmitted by nerves of sight to the braith 
where an impression is made and recorded. In this “camera” | 
there are three refracting media, but for our purpose of disc 
sion we need consider only the lens. This lens is a semi-gelatitr 
ous substance that can be thickened or flattened according 8 
certain muscles act upon it. The covering of the eyeis compose!

of muscular coats, the inner lining of which at the back is com 
posed of the sensitive retina, which corresponds to the plate in 
the camera. Now, inasmuch as in a camera the ground glass 
  Fic. 94—Human Eve IN SECTION 
must be moved back and forth in order to get a clear image, 
according as the object is near or far away, so in the eye pro- 
vision is made, that we may be able to see clearly near and fat 
objects. The shape of the eyeball cannot be changed by a 
muscular action. It is the lens that changes. A thick lens will 
form an image much nearer than will a thin one, because the 
curve is greater and the refraction is greater in the thicker om 
(Fig. 95). Therefore, when objects are far off the lens is made 
thin by relaxing the ciliary muscle, and the image forms clearly 
on the retina. If the object now comes nearer, or we look a4 
near object, with the lens thin the image would form clearly 
at a point behind the retina, if it could. Thus, where the 
strike the retina they do not focus; so we make the lens thicke! 
by bringing the ciliary muscle into action (Fig. 96), and the 
image focuses clearly on the retina. This process of changit$

the thickness of the lens to focus for near and for far objects is 
called accommodation (Fig. 97). When the ciliary muscle is at 
test the lens is thin, so that distant objects can be seen clearly 
without effort. The ciliary 
muscle pulls against the sus- 
pensory ligament, which re- 
faxes its pull on the lens. 
The lens then becomes more 
curved, 
121, Defects of the Eye. 
Many eyes are not normal, 
owing to various defects. If 
; Normal, the eye lens should 
be such that when the ciliary 
muscle is relaxed and the 
lens is thin, images of dis- & 
tant objects form clearly on 
the retina. In some eyes it is 
Necessary to thicken the lens 
to get this clear image of dis-. 
‘ant objects. This is gener- 
ally because the eyeball is too short from front to back 
(Fig. 982) and the image

at a distance better than persons with normal eyes. This i 
because they bring the ciliary muscle into action slightly, eve 
in looking off at a distance, and get as a result a very delicat 
agit adjustment of the lens, where a normal per 
cia, son is used to seeing fairly well without th 
. use of the muscle. Such eyes are therefor 
gmet called farsighted. To correct this defect, ifi 
is considerable, convex lenses are placed i 
front of the eye (Fig. 98b), producing th 
same effect that is brought about by thicker 
ing the lens. 
Fis. 96.— Acton On the other hand, some persons cannd 
or Crutary Mus- Possibly see clearly objects far off, but cal

122. Astigmatism, This is another common defect in eyes 
It manifests itself in one’s inability to see clearly at the same 
time all the lines in a diagram like Figure 100. The cause of 
this is that the front part of th 
eye called the cornea is na 
curved equally all over, witl 
the result that the ciliary muscle, 
which acts uniformly on al 
parts of the lens, is being cor 
tinually called into action # 
focus first for lines in one al 
then for those in another dire 
tion as we read. This quick 
Fic. 100.—Lings For Derecr- tires the muscle and eyestrail 
NG AsTicMaTisy results. It is corrected by te 
use of cylindrical glasses in which the curve sufficiently increas 
the curve of the cornea at its defective points. In fitting glasses 
to persons with defective eyesight, the oculist seeks to get ¢host 
glasses that will make the eye nearly like a normal one. They 
do not make com- 
plete correction, 
as that tends to 
weaken the eye. 
123. Binocular 
Vision. Many 
think that two eyes 
are given us as a 
safeguard against total blindness in case one is injured. The 
real reason is that with two eyes we can better locate objet 
than with one. A simple test of this is for a person to let som 
one hold a fountain pen in front of him, and then, with one 124 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS

shut, try to place the cap over the point. With both eyes open 
it is a simple matter. The action of the muscles that turn our 
eyes serves as a means of judging distances, the two inner ones 
acting more strongly when we look at near objects. The amount 
of this effort aids us in our judgment (Fig. 101). Sometimes 
the muscle in one eye is weaker than in the other. To correct 
this prismatic eyeglasses are used. 
124. Blind Spot. There is one other advantage gained by having 
two eyes. Where the optic nerve enters the back of the eye there is one 
spot on the retina that is not sensitive to receive an impression, It is 
+ 
on the side of the retina toward the nose. Its presence may easily be 
shown by looking steadily at the black spot in Figure 102 with the right 
tye closed. If the book is moved until it is about 1 ft. away the + dis- 
appears. At 8 in. and at 14 in. it reappears. With the left eye closed, 
the + must be looked at and the spot will then disappear. This is 
because the optic nerve enters at the left of the center of the right 
tye, and at the right of the center of the left eye. For this reason we do 
Not notice the disappearance of objects when the image of them falls 
on the blind spot in one eye, since the other eye receives the impression.

se of regulating the amount 
of light that passes into the eye. 
When the light is strong, the iris 
contracts, thereby making the 
pupil very small. Otherwise the 
sensitive retina might be injured 
by the too intense light. In dim 
light the pupil is large, so as to In Strong Light

and thus enable us to see better. 
It is on account of this enlarged 
pupil that we are dazzled when 
coming from darkness out into 
strong sunlight. This condition

tloses and the pupil becomes 
small again. It is the large size 
of the pupil in the eye of the cat, owl, and other animals at

134. Color. In our study of refraction thus far we have 
only considered the fact that a ray of light passing from one 
medium to another is refracted. In reality something more has 
happened. I we allow a ray of sunlight to pass through a prism 
and place a white screen in the path of the refracted ray, a band 
of light of several colors appears upon the screen (Fig. 115). 
This band of colors is similar to that we see in the rainbow, 
  
    
Fic. 115 
and is called the Solar Spectrum. A similar spectrum may be 
obtained by using an, arc light as our source. The so-called 
white light of the sun has been broken up into seven colors, 
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, known 4 
the elementary colors. Of these the red has been refracted the 
least and the violet the most. In our previous study (Section 93) 
we have learned that the slower molecular vibrations produce 
the longer light waves, while the more rapid ones produce the 
short waves. The longest red waves are retarded least in the 
glass and are refracted least. If light waves from other sources 
than the sun are passed through a prism, a like refraction takes

place, the color of the light on the screen depending upon the 
color of the waves emitted by the luminous object. From a 
sodium flame there will be nothing but yellow; from a kerosene 
lamp the yellow will be brightest; from the Welsbach light we 
shall get less yellow and more green; from the mercury vapor 
light the green will predominate. Colors of lights depend upon 
the wave lengths of the light waves they emit. 
135. Color Sensation. According to the modern theory of 
color sensation, there are three sets of nerves in the retina of the 
eye, sensitive respectively to red, green, and blue light waves. 
When these are equally stimulated, white results. If only the 
ed set of nerves is stimulated, red color sensation alone results. 
Likewise blue when the blue set is stimulated; and green from 
stimulation of the green set. If more than one set are stimu- 
lated at the same time, intermediate colors are produced. These 
vary according to the proportionate amount of stimulation each 
Set of nerves receives. 
Color, whether of lights or of anything else, is a sensation, 
and depends upon the length of the light waves that come to 
the eye. 
_ 136. Absorption and Reflection of Color Waves. If, 
instead of a white screen, a dead black surface is used to receive 
in solar spectrum formed, as in Section 134, there will be very 
© evidence of color on the screen.’ The light waves fall 
a the black screen but are not reflected to the eye, and no 
comes results. Black objects absorb all light waves that 
hand to them and reflect none. White objects, on the other 
a whine all colors equally and absorb none. Any part of 
ton " Surface looks the color of the light waves that come 
light Wann part of a black surface is black, no matter what 
ves come to it. u The surface must be a dead black.
-P-A-G-E-144

137- Color of Opaque Objects. Some substances possess 
the power of absorbing some color waves and reflecting others. 
The color we call objects depends upon the light waves that 
come to them and upon which of these the waves are reflected. 
An object called red reflects red waves best, and absorbs most 
of the other color waves when white light falls upon it; likewise 
a blue object reflects blue waves best, and absorbs others. These 
objects reflect other color waves also somewhat, but the red pre- 
dominates in the first and the blue in the second. If now the 
light waves coming to the red object are of a color that the 
object absorbs, the object will look black, as nothing is reflected. 
A piece of rough red cloth or paper when held in the spectrum 
looks red where the red light waves fall, but elsewhere it looks 
nearly black. A green object looks bright green in the greet 
part of the spectrum where green waves fall upon it, but if it 
is placed in the other parts of the spectrum the colors are very 
dim if apparent at all. Prussian blue reflects blue waves Very 
well; also green and violet waves in less degree. Afl other color 
waves it absorbs. In white light it looks Prussian blue. In blue 
light it looks different, as there are no green or violet waves 
to be reflected and stimulate the eye. In green light it looks 
green; in violet light, violet. The color in neither of the last 
two cases is as strong as the blue in blue light. 
Similarly a yellow pigment looks different in white light 
from what it does in yellow light. In green light it looks gree" 
and in red light red. In blue light it looks black. This is because 
it reflects yellow waves best ; but also reflects green, orange, and 
red waves, absorbing all other color waves. 
What light waves an object reflects depends upon the Hight 
waves that come to it and which of these it absorbs, Colof 
is not in objects, as many suppose.
-P-A-G-E-145
LIGHT 137 
It is on this account that colored materials selected in day- 
light look so different under artificial light. Some artificial 
lights lack blue waves, as the kerosene lamp and ordinary fish- 
tail gas flame ; others lack red and yellow waves, as the Welsbach 
gas light and mercury vapor electric light. Blue cloth in the 
yellow light of the kerosene lamp looks nearly black, because 
it absorbs yellow waves. 
Clothing and ribbons appear quite different in the daylight 
from the way they appear in different colored lights cast by 
fireworks at night. : 
In the mercury vapor light there are green and blue waves, 
but no red waves. In such a light our faces took ghastly, as 
there are no red rays to be reflected by the blood in the face. 
As the skin reflects green and blue waves, it appears the color 
of these. 
138. Color of Transparent Objects. Just as the color of 
opaque objects depends upon the light waves they reflect, so the 
color of transparent objects depends upon the light waves they 
transmit. The power to transmit varies. The color of the waves 
ittransmits in greatest degree determines the color of a piece of 
glass, even though it transmits other color waves somewhat. 
Ifa piece of red glass is held between the prism and the screen 
on which a spectrum falls, the screen looks red where the red 
Part of the spectrum is. Elsewhere it looks black. A piece of 
blue glass absorbs all the color waves but blue and green. The 
two glasses together absorb all the color waves, and no color 
appears on the screen, which is now black. A piece of yellow 
glass transmits yellow light waves freely; green and red waves 
less freely ; blue and violet waves not at all. If blue and yellow 
glasses are placed together, only green waves will be transmitted 
by both, and the screen looks green.
-P-A-G-E-146
138 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
Solutions of Ammoniacal copper sulphate and of Potassium 
bichromate act in the same way as blue and yellow glass respec- 
tively, when placed separately or together in the path of the 
band of color waves. 
139. Compound Colors. The reason that we get the above 
results is that it is almost impossible to get substances that have 
the power to reflect or to transmit colors of one wave length 
only. While it is perfectly possible to get chemical substances 
that look the same as any color in the spectrum, we find that 
this is the result of two or more color waves combined. For 
example, a mixture of red and green waves gives a yellow that 
looks exactly like the yellow of the spectrum. Such colors are 
called compound colors, as contrasted with the pure colors of 
the spectrum. 
140. Matching of Colors—Dyeing. When cloth is dyed, 
a substance is put into it that has the power to absorb all the 
color waves of white light except those that produce the desired 
color. Two pieces of cloth of the same material, dyed at the 
same time, with the same dye, should look alike in all lights. 
Two pieces that were dyed with different dyes, labelled the same 
as far as color is concerned, might look alike in some lights and 
different in others. Often people match cloth and ribbon in the 
artificial light of a store, only to find them quite different when 
exposed to daylight. Here the dyestuff in both reflects the arti- 
ficial light waves equally, but one reflects in the daylight either 
the same color waves in different proportion, or an additional 
color wave that the other dyestuff does not. 
141. Fading of Cloth. Gradually, when exposed to su 
light, some dyestuffs, through chemical action, change in com- 
position and lose their power to absorb certain color waves. As 
a result the cloth fades, becoming more nearly white. It is easy
-P-A-G-E-147
LIGHT 139 
to see why it should approach white and not black, since it 
reflects more of the light waves. 
142, Color Mixing. Figure 116 represents a piece of appa- 
ratus for recombining the colors of the spectrum. It consists 
of seven mirrors fitted on small rotating stands. When placed 
at the proper position and distance from the prism of Section 134, 
each mirror will receive one 
of the seven spectrum colors. 
By turning the mirrors, these 
different color waves may be 
thrown together or separately 
upon some spot on the white 
screen. If all are thrown at 
once we get a white spot 
formed by the recombined 
Spectrum colors. Red and 
green-combined look yellow. 
Red, green, and blue produce 
White, These three kinds of color waves, which produce the 
same effect as do the waves of all the spectrum together, are 
therefore called the three primary colors. We have here a case 
of addition of color wave sensations in the eye, stimulating all 
three sets of nerves. From the proper mixture of these three 
color waves, any of the other colors of the spectrum may be 
Produced, 
  Fic. 116 
143. Complementary Colors. Since all seven sets of color 
Waves that go to make up the spectrum together produce the 
Sensation white, it is easy to see that six of them will produce 
* color effect that together with the seventh will produce 
“nsation white. A great number of such combinations is 
Possible. There is always one compound color that when added
-P-A-G-E-148
I40 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
to any given color produces white. Such a pair of colors are 
called complementary. Figure 117 is so arranged ‘that the 
colors or intermediate colors on opposite sides of the circle are 
complementary. 
Let us take a circular brass disc upon which a piece of white 
paper has been pasted, and paint one-half of it with Prussian blue pigment and the other half with yellow pigment. Let us 
whirl this rapidly on 
the whirling machine 
(Fig. 118), with 
white light falling 
upon it. The result- 
ant color will be 
white. In this case 
there has been an 
addition of color sen- 
sations in the eye

Mis. 117 low, red, and green 
waves. There has been a rapid succession of color waves of 
the whale spectrum coming to the eye, producing the sensation 
white. 
144. Mixing of Pigments, If upon another piece of white 
paper we mix the two pigments Prussian blue and yellow, 
green is the resulting color. Why we do not get white, as whet 
whirling these two pigments together, may be readily seen from 
the fact that yellow pigment absorbs blue, indigo, and violet 
waves, while blue pigment absorbs red, orange, and yellow waves 
 
-P-A-G-E-149

Together they absorb all but the green waves, which are reflected 
tothe eye and determine the color of the mixture.

Inthe case of pigment mixing the process is one of subtraction 
of color waves, not of addition, 
as in the whirling of the colored

145. Primary Pigment 
Colors, Since blue and yellow 
pigments, when mixed, reflect 
only green waves, the addition 
of red pigment, which absorbs 
green waves, will produce no 
color, or at least a very indiffer- 
ent muddy brown, These three 
Pigments, red, yellow, and blue, 
are called the primary pigment

ing pigments, to get white.

absorb is diminished by the added substance, white. If the 
Power to absorb is increased by the mixing of a substance that 
Teflects no light, called a black substance, then a shade results.

diminished,

147. Printing in Color. The art of printing in color has | 
been developed to such a high degree that today it is possible 
to secure reproductions that are almost true to the color appear- 
ance of the object they represent. This has been made possible 
through the three-color process, which has been developed from 
the half-tone process of printing in black and white. 
148. Half-Tone Process of Printing. In this process a 
negative is made of the picture or object that is to be reproduced. 
This is made through a screen placed close to the plate, between 
  Fic. 119—ScREEN FOR MAKING HAL-Tone NEGATIVES 
it and the lens. This screen is made up of two finely ruled glass 
plates, on each of which there are from 75 to 200 parallel lines 
to the inch. The ruled sides face each other in such a way that 
a series of diamond-shaped openings result (Fig. 119). Whet 
the picture is taken, it is the light that passes through these 
openings that affects the sensitized plate. The negative obtained 
is not made up of solid masses of black, gray, or transparent 
parts, but consists of irregular shapes, from fine black dots fat 
apart and surrounded by large transparent areas to portions 
of almost solid black with fine transparent dots scattered over 
them, Between these two extremes there are portions that are 
made up of varying amounts of black and transparent areas.

Figure 120 shows in a magnified form the appearance of the 
man in the bottom picture of Figure 110, as seen in the negative 
from which the half-tone plate of Figure 110 was made. 
The negative* is printed upon a copper plate which has upon 
it a coating that becomes insoluble in water wherever light waves 
     Fic. 120 Fic. 121 
have acted upon it. When this printed copper plate is washed 
with water, the bare copper represents those parts where light 
waves did not pass through the negative, which were the light 
parts of the original object. This bare copper is then etched by 
1In ordinary photography, where the print from the negative is the final product, the print so obtained would be just as the object looked as far as right and left were concerned. But in 
the half-tone process the negative must be turned around, because the final printing with ink is 
done from a metal plate printed from this negative. The film is transferred to another piece of 
glass, so that what was previously next the glass is now away from it.
-P-A-G-E-153
144 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
a solution that dissolves copper. The parts where the coating 
was made insoluble are not affected, and remain as projections 
even with the original surface of the plate. These projec- 
tions represent the dark parts of the original object. Figure 121 
shows the magnified appearance on the copper plate of the same 
part of Figure 110 that Figure 120 represents in the negative. 
When this copper surface is inked and an impression is made 
upon paper, the black parts will be made by the projections on 
the plate. The different projections and depressions are so small 
and so close together that the eye gets only the general effect 
of all the separate black impressions. Where the impressions 
are close together, the print appears black; where far apart, it 
appears white; while gray results when they are between these 
two extremes. This may be likened to three squares of equal 
size, in which dots have been placed. If these are scattered in 
the first, a little nearer together in the second, and close together 
in the third, the effect will be white, gray, and black, if they 
are looked at from a distance. 
If Figure 121, which is the positive, is held at arm’s length, 
the outline of the face is not clear; but ifthe book is placed 
eight or ten feet away, the appearance is nearly the same as the 
face in Figure 110, though reversed. , 
149. Three-Color Process. This differs from the regular 
black and white half-tone process in that three negatives and 
three half-tone plates must be made for the one object to be 
reproduced. These negatives are made, one through a violet 
piece of glass called a color filter, the second through a blue- 
green filter, and the third through an orange filter. The first 
negative is dark where the violet waves from the object passed 
through the filter to the plate. The dark parts of the second 
represent the green waves, and of the third represent orange
-P-A-G-E-154
LIGHT 145 
waves. All other color waves are combinations of these three 
colors, so that some will affect two or more plates, according 
as they contain more or less orange, violet, or green waves. 
-Half-tone copper plates are made from these three negatives, 
and they are then printed, one after the other, upon the same 
‘spot. It must be borne in mind that the projections on the 
copper plate which do the printing represent the parts of the 
negative not affected. by the light waves when the picture was 
‘taken. These represent the parts in the original object mot re- 
flecting violet for the first plate, not green for the second plate, 
and not orange for the third plate. Therefore the ink used on - 
the first half-tone in printing must be the complement of violet, 
ywhich is yellow (see Fig. 117). The ink for the second plate 
vis the complement of green, which is red; that on the third 
plate is the complement of orange, which is blue. These inks 
must be as nearly pure colors as possible, to get the best results. 
The colors of the glass filters and of the inks used determine 
ina large measure how nearly true the results are. 
The color plate facing page 143 shows (1) the prints of 
‘the three separate plates, (2) the print of the yellow and red 
,fogether, and (3) the print of the three plates together. Exami- 
nation of the last one with the microscope will show how the 
different colored dots lie side by side, producing upon the eye 
a combined color effect. 
Sometimes a fourth negative is made through a yellow 
filter. Gray ink is used on the half-tone plate made from this. 
‘The result of this fourth impression, which is printed first, is a 
softening effect over the whole picture. Such a fourth impres- 
sion, though it produces a more pleasing effect on the eye, 
throws the colors out of their true proportion. 
150. Color Blindness. One of the sets of color nerves is
-P-A-G-E-155
146 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
often lacking or weakened in a person. Sometimes two sets are 
affected, and in very rare cases three. To a person lacking 
in all three, color sense is lacking; light and shade only are 
apparent. The effect produced upon an eye in which one set is 
lacking is quite different from that upon a normal eye. A yellow 
object, appears quite green to a person lacking in the red set, 
since yellow sensation is a combined effect on the red and green 
nerves. Prussian blue looks bluer to a person lacking in the 
green set of nerves than to one in whom the nerves are normal. 
Those who are color blind in the red set of nerves cannot be 
depended upon in places where danger signals in the form 
of red lights are used, as on railroads. Color blindness may 
in some cases account for the startling combinations of colors 
worn by some persons. 
Color blindness is commoner among men than among 
women. About one man in every twenty-five is affected in one 
set of nerves.t 
The test for color blindness is the sorting of a pile of 
different colored skeins of worsted. A color-blind person puts 
together into the same pile different colored skeins. 
151. The Rainbow. Whenever sunlight coming from behind 
a person falls upon a mist from a fountain or a hose a solar 
spectrum appears in the mist. In the same way, when sunlight 
falls upon mist in the sky a spectrum appears. To this we give 
the name rainbow. Rainbows appear either in the early morn- 
ing or late afternoon, after a rainstorm has passed over a place. 
The sunlight falling upon the raindrops as they move away is 
refracted and internally reflected by the individual drops 
(Fig. 122). At the same time the light waves are broken up

ness in men.

into the seven elementary colors which appear in bands on the 
sky. 
While this phenomenon of internal reflection and dispersion 
of the white light into its elementary colors takes place when- 
ever sunlight falls upon water drops in the atmosphere, the 
rainbow effect is seen only when the light waves as they come
-P-A-G-E-157
148 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
from the drops pass downward towards the ground. This 
happens only when the sun is rather low in the sky, never in the 
late morning or early afternoon. 
From the lower drops we get a rainbow in which the red 
is on top. From the drops higher up a second rainbow appears. 
In this the red is on the bottom. In the second case the ray of 
light has been internally reflected upward instead of downward. 
The semi-circular form of the rainbow can be explained by 
likening the reflection to that of parallel rays from the surface 
of a concave spherical mirror, in which all the rays from the sun 
focus at the principal focus, at which the observer stands. No 
two persons will see the same rainbow, as a different set of rain- 
drops is acting in each case. The same person sees a different 
rainbow, if he changes his position. 
The play of color seen in the sparkle of the diamond is 
caused by the same sort of internal reflection and dispersion 
of light. Diamond has great refractive power and low critical 
angle. It is cut so as to get the greatest possible amount of this 
internal reflection. 
152. Sunset Colors. We have all noticed the beautiful 
colors produced at sunset, particularly when there are clouds 
in the sky. These may be explained as being a result of the 
combined effect of absorption and reflection of light. The light 
waves must pass through a greater thickness of atmosphere at 
sunset than at midday, and therefore there is a greater chance 
for absorption ; and since the rays strike the clouds from below, 
the opportunity for reflection is greater.

RADIATION AS APPLIED TO HEAT AND 
LIGHT ENERGY 
153. Effects Produced upon Radiant Heat Waves. Hav- 
ing studied the various effects produced upon light waves, we 
are in a better position to understand those produced upon the 
other form of radiant energy, heat waves. Just as in the case 
of light waves, heat waves may be transmitted, absorbed, re- 
flected, and refracted. The difference lies in the fact that the 
same substances do not necessarily act the same on both. We 
must bear in mind that while heat waves themselves are as a rule 
longer than are light waves, they in turn can be divided into 
both long and short waves. Those that come from objects 
that do not emit light waves also are the long ones, while from 
objects emitting light waves come short heat waves as well.
-P-A-G-E-159
150 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
With these facts clearly in mind, we are in a position to grasp 
explanations that follow. Let us see first if all hot objects set 
up heat waves equally well in the ether. Ifa rough surfaced 
teakettle and a smooth surfaced one are filled with boiling water 
and set aside, the rough one will cool off much faster. . Likewise 
if two cups, one rough and one shiny, are filled with hot water 
a similar effect will be produced. In fact, any rough object cools 
off (radiates heat) faster than a smooth one. For this reason 
radiators are always rough, as we wish the heat to get out of 
them into the room as easily as possible. The bottoms of tea- 
kettles are made rough, as it is thus that the heat is absorbed 
by the water inside. We say then that rough surfacc- ~*--+ 
easy radiation and are easy absorbers of heat, while 
surfaces, which are poor radiators, are also poor abso: 
Coming to the matter of color in clothing, we have : 
white objects absorb no light waves, while black ones uoue 
practically all light waves. If we allow sunlight to fall on black 
cloth, the light waves, being absorbed, are turned to heat and 
the cloth becomes warmer. With white cloth scarcely --+ +9 
perature effect is produced. We therefore wear darli 
in winter when we go out into the sunlight merely t JJ. we

khaki are worn in the tropics for this reason. Becai 
conversion of light waves to heat when sunlight 
Ieaves on the snow, holes form underneath, as d: 
become warmer than the surrounding snow. 
Icicles form when the sunlight beats down on the 
of houses, warming them and causing the snow to- 
water dripping from the eaves gets out from the ir 
the warm roof and meets the air that is colder that 
It thus freezes a little at a time and forms icicles.

154. The effect of glass on heat and light waves may be shown with 
a piece of apparatus known as the radiometer (Fig. 123). In this there 
are four light aluminum vanes mounted upon a delicate frame. One side 
of each vane is shiny and silvery and the other side is rough and black. 
The vanes are so placed that when they revolve the 
rough sides face all one way. The bulb is nearly 
exhausted of air. When this is held near a Bunsen 
flame the vanes whirl, with the rough side moving 
away from the heat. If now a piece of thick glass is 
placed between the bulb and the flame, the rotation 
soon slows down. If the holes of the burner are 
closed, a yellow flame resulting, the vanes at once 
move faster. 
The explanation of this is that in the first case, 
where heat waves only were coming to the vanes, 
the rough surface absorbed them faster and therefore 
became warmer than the shiny surface on the vane 
at the other end of the cross-piece. The molecules of 
air next to the rough vane were, as a result, heated 
more and therefore set in greater vibration. They thus 
hit the rough vane harder and made it move away. 
When the light waves came, after the glass shut off the heat waves, the 
black surface absorbed the light waves more than did the white surface, 
thus again becoming warmer. 
155. Cold Frames. While glass and water are transparent to the 
light waves and to short heat waves, they are nearly opaque to the long 
heat waves. If, then, we surround a bed of violets with a wooden frame 
and over this place a tight-fitting glass frame, the light waves passing 
readily through the glass will be absorbed by the dark earth and turned 
into heat to warm the plants. The long heat waves set up cannot pass 
out through the glass, so that by day there is a gradual accumulation of 
heat which keeps the plants warm through the night in the midst of 
winter. In the same way the light waves are utilized in helping to keep 
greenhouses warm. 
156. Radiation and Its Effect upon Temperature. Inas- 
much as damp air is transparent to light waves, but not to long 
heat waves, a result similar to that of the cold frame takes place 
when there are clouds over any part of the earth, and at night 
the air remains warm. If, however, the air is dry and clear,

157. Origin of Sound. Most persons if asked to define 
sound would say that it is something we hear, just as light is 
something we see. This is true as far as the sensation itself 
is concerned. But each sensation has its cause, as we have 
learned in heat.and light. Under certain conditions the sensa- 
tion of sound results, for it can be produced by clapping the 
hands together, by striking a bell or a piano wire, by bursting 
a bag, the air in which has suddenly been squeezed, by forcing 
air from our lungs between the stretched vocal cords in the 
throat. If we touch the bell, piano wire, or throat during 
the time that we hear the sound from them, we find a vibrating 
154
-P-A-G-E-164
SOUND 155 
or quivering condition. In fact, we learn that in every instance 
the origin of sound lies in the vibration of some object. In 
sound the vibration can be seen or felt, and we do not have to 
assume it as we must with radiant heat and light, in which the 
invisible molecules are supposed to be the vibrating source. ) 
158. Medium through Which the Vibrations Get to Our 
Ears. Just as in heat and light, so in sound, vibrating substances 
set up waves; the difference being that sound waves are not 
transmitted by the ether, but by gases, solids, 
and liquids, things with which we are all 
familiar. Commonest of these is the air. By 
means of the apparatus shown in Figure 124, 
it can be shown that ether is not the medium 
through which sound waves pass. An elec- 
tric bell is suspended in the bell jar by means 
of the coils of wire, which also serve as con- 
ductors for the current that rings the bell. 
As long as there is air in the bell jar, the 
ringing of the bell. can be heard distinctly. 
If we pump out the air the sound becomes fainter, until when 
the air is nearly all removed the ringing can be scarcely heard, 
though the clapper can be seen vibrating. If air is now re- 
admitted, the sound gradually increases, until, with all the air 
back, the ringing of the bell is as distinct as before. Had the 
bell been rigidly fastened to the glass jar, the ringing could 
have been heard more clearly during the experiment, because 
the vibrations would have been imparted to the glass through 
the metal or wood parts of the bell, and the vibrating glass 
would have set up waves in the air outside. 
159. Manner in Which the Waves Pass through the 
Transmitting Medium. This perhaps may best be illustrated

by a spiral spring (Fig. 125). If the end A is struck, there | 
will be a pushing together of the coils at that end. They are 
thus thrown out of equilibrium. In coming back to their orig- |

inal condition they will pass by the starting point and vibrate 
just as a clamped stick when pulled aside swings to and fro 
(Fig. 126). The vibration of the coils produces a compression 
on the next coils, which, going through the same 
process, impart the effect to the next, and so on. 
In this manner a wave of successive compressions 
passes through the spring. Now, in the case of! 
bursting a bag, the compressed air inside, on 
being set free, produces. the same kind of effec 
on the air outside, air being just as capable oi! 
vibrating as is the brass spring. Waves are set up 
in the air, only they pass in every direction, nol 
. from end to end, as in the case of the coil of wire 
The waves are said to pass along in the form of

closer than ordinarily, then rebounding and flying farther 
apart than before. It must be clearly borne in mind that the 
molecules do not move along with the waves, but simply, in 
vibrating to and fro, impart the suc- 
cessive impulses onwards to the next 
molecules, as do the molecules in trans- 
mitting heat by conduction. This may 
be shown by placing a lighted candle 
at the small end of the ro-ft. tube 
(Fig. 128). The waves produced by 
slapping two books together will put 
out the flame. The waves pass through 
the tube in a shorter interval of time than it would take the air 
molecules to move from one end to the other. 
160. Effects Produced by Sound Waves. If sound waves 
fall upon the receptive ear, the sensation of sound results. If 
they fall upon the diaphragm or disc in the phonograph or tele- 
  Fre. 127 
  Fic, 128 
phone, they set it in vibration. If of sufficient force, as in the 
case of waves set up by violent explosions, they may even break 
windows or cause houses to shake. 
161. Speed of Sound Waves. Compared with light waves, 
the speed with which sound waves pass, even through the best 
media, is very slow, as shown by the table.

Water, 5,000 Oak, 12,600 
Steel, 16,000 
162. Intensity or Loudness of Sound Waves. When a 
large bell is struck, the sound produced is loudest at first, but 
gradually dies away as the vibration diminishes. Extent of the 
to and fro motion determines the amplitude of the vibration. 
When this is greatest the sound produced is loudest. 
We have learned (Section 98) that the intensity or bright- 
ness of light diminishes as the square of the distance from the 
source. The intensity or loudness of sound diminishes at the , 
same rate. Sound waves, like light waves, spread out in every 
direction, covering an area that increases as the square of the 
distance from the source. 
Loudness of sound waves thus depend on (1) the amplitude 
of the vibration of the vibrating body, and (2) the square of the 
distance from the source. 
“Putting one’s ear to the ground” is an expression originat- 
ing in the fact that one can hear approaching horses, teams, 
or trains much better in that way than through the air. An 
approaching train can be heard when far away by listening 
at the rail. A blow on a steam pipe in any part of a house can 
be heard very distinctly in every room through which the pipe 
passes.

REFLECTION OF SOUND WAVES 
163. If sound waves can be prevented from spreading in - 
all directions and concentrated in one direction, the loudness 
can be increased. Sound waves undergo reflection, just as do 
light waves, when they encounter 
a medium different from the one 
through which they are passing. A 
sounding board placed above and 
behind a speaker or band reflects 
some of the sound waves in one 
general direction, which thus helps 
out those naturally going in that direction. In the megaphone 
and speaking tube we have this reflection phenomenon most 
advantageously utilized (Fig. 129). 
It is on account of reflection of sound waves from the walls 
of a room that a person’s voice sounds louder indoors than out 
in an open field. 
  Fic. 129.—MEGAPHONE
-P-A-G-E-169
160 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
Smooth, hard surfaces reflect better than do rough, soft 
ones. For this reason the presence of furniture, curtains, or 
human beings in a room deadens the sound by breaking up the 
waves. 
164. Echoes. Sound waves require one second to travel 
1,100 ft. in air and the human ear is able to recognize five short 
syllables a second. 
In 4 of a second sound waves will travel 220 ft. in the air. 
Reflecting surfaces more than I1o ft. away will thus cause 
reflected sound waves to be heard at the starting point more 
than + of a second after those heard directly. The sound will 
thus be heard twice. Such a repetition is known as an echo, 
which is a common phenomenon in valleys, the sides of which 
are smooth and nearly vertical. Sometimes multiple echoes 
result and the sound is heard many times repeated. If the size 
and shape of a room are such that the sound waves reflected 
from wall to wall take more than 4 of a second to return to their 
origin, we get echoes. Echoes in a hall are most objection- 
able and are often corrected by stretches of cloth so arranged 
as to interfere with the reflected waves. If, however, the sound 
waves return in less than } of a second, so as not to produce 
distinct repetitions, a resounding effect known as réverberation 
results. It is because of this effect that empty rooms sound 
hollow. Halls sound so when empty; but when a room has in 
it furniture and portiéres, or the hall is filled with people, the 
reflection of the sound waves is interfered with and the rever- 
beration becomes much less.

flection is utilized. When in use the large end of this is placed

2. Why is it so easy to hear whispers in an empty room? 
3. Explain the “roar of the sea” heard in large shells held

MUSICAL SOUNDS 
166. Musical Sounds and Noises. Sounds may be divided 
into two classes, depending on the uniformity or regularity of 
the waves. In the case of waves resulting from the rattling 
of dishes, from water running from the faucet into the sink, 
from water boiling in the kettle, from the rumbling of thunder, 
from wagons rolling on the pavements, the vibrations that set 
them up in the air are complex and the waves produce a dis- 
agreeable result called a noise. If the vibrations are of one sort 
and regular, such as in the case of the vibrating teeth of a comb, 
as the thumb nail is run across them, we get a musical sound. 
Sound proper deals with the latter.
-P-A-G-E-171
162 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
167. Characteristics of Musical Sounds. We speak of 
musical sounds as being high or low in pitch, loud or soft in 
intensity, and as having quality, which distinguishes them from 
other sounds of the same pitch and loudness. It is this last that 
enables us to recognize which instrument is being played or who 
it is that we hear speaking at the other end of the telephone line. 
It is sometimes figuratively called color. 
168. Musical Pitch. If we examine the strings of the piano 
or the pipes of the organ, we find that the wires and pipes that 
correspond to the low notes are large and long, while the high 
notes come from small short ones. 
If a pasteboard card is held so as to strike successively 
against the teeth of the wheel 4 (Fig. 131) when it is made to 
: revolve at high speed, the successive 
vibrations of the card produce a musical 
note. With increased speed the pitch of 
this becomes higher. If at the same time 
another card is held against the wheel 
B, which has a larger number of teeth, 
a note of higher pitch results. We thus 
see that the greater the number of vibra- 
tions and consequent waves that are set up in a given time the 
higher is the pitch produced. 
169. Siren Disc. That pitch rises with increased frequency 
of vibration may also be shown by the so-called Siren Disc 
(Fig. 132). In this there are eight circles of holes. (In this 
figure part of the disc is cut away to show the means of rota- 
tion and the impulse attachment.) The outer circle has 48 holes, 
the next has 45, then 40, 36, 32, 30, 27, 24, respectively. The 
impulse attachment consists of a piece of metal fastened to a 
bellows or other source of compressed air. By means of thumb 
  Fic. 131
-P-A-G-E-172
SOUND 163 
screws, eight in number, it is possible to direct an air stream 
against any one of the eight circles of the disc. If we open the 
inner hole and rotate the disc, a chopping off of the air-stream 
will be noticed. As the speed 
of the rotation increases, 
there will come such frequent 
chopping that a musical note 
of low pitch results. With 
further increase of speed the 
pitch of this rises. We may 
vary the pitch by the speed 
of rotation, which determines 
the frequency with which the 
successive pulsations are set 
up in the air. 
Let us now see what relation exists between the vibrations 
set up in the air by the inner and outer holes of the siren disc. 
If we open the outer and inner holes the notes will seem nearly 
the same to the untrained ear, though an experienced person 
will recognize a second note, an octave higher. Here we have 
  Fie. 132 
twice as many vibrations set up in a second, since there are 48 
holes to the outer circle while there are only 24 to the inner 
circle. If we now shut the outer tube and open the fourth from 
the outside, which is opposite the circle of 36 holes, we shall 
get a note that, together with that obtained from the inner, pro- 
duces a very agreeable sensation. The same holds true if we 
open the sixth hole, opposite the 30-hole circle, while the inner 
one is open. We thus see that with vibration frequencies that 
bear the ratio 24 to 48, 24 to 36, 24 to 30, we get harmonious 
combinations. These ratios simplified become 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 
4 to §, respectively.
-P-A-G-E-173
164 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
If we try opening together the outer and second holes, which 
bear the ratio 48 to 45, or the fifth and sixth from the outside, 
with ratio 32 to 30, the result is very disagreeable. 
When vibrations which bear simple ratios to each other act 
together, harmony results. Experiments have shown that three 
notes with the ratio 4 to 5 to 6 sounded together are harmoni- 
ous. Three such notes are called a major triad or chord. Some- 
times a fourth note, the octave of the lowest, giving ratio 4 to 
5 to 6 to 8, is added. 
170. Musical Scale. The musical scale with which most of 
us are familiar has been built up of three such triads as men- 
tioned above. The diatonic scale is composed of seven notes 
which connect the two notes an octave apart. These notes are 
lettered c de f g abc’, and are called do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, 
si, do’. The three triads are do, mi, sol, sol, si, re’, and fa, la, do’. 
If we place these in their proper places in the scale, the relation 
that exists between do and the succeeding notes, calling do 1, 
is as follows:

In the key of C, in which C is do, which we are now con- 
sidering, and with which we are all familiar, this note middle C 
of the piano is produced by 256 vibrations per second.+ By 
multiplying this number by the respective fractions indicated 
1In international pitch, middle C has 261 vibrations, and in concert pitch 274.
-P-A-G-E-174
SOUND 165 
for each note, the vibration frequencies of these other notes 
may be easily calculated, with results as indicated below. 
For the purpose of giving intermediate tones, notes have 
been added between c and d, d and e, f and g, g and a, 
a and b, giving us sharps and flats, which are represented on 
the keyboard by the black keys. We have as a result twelve

notes to the octave on the keyboard (Fig. 133). The intervals 
between the notes of the diatonic scale are very nearly equal, 
and serve the purpose just as long asc is the key note. If, how- 
ever, we attempt to build up a scale with any other key note, 
as g, we find that of the eight above notes only six will serve; 
a and f' are different.

We thus need two new notes. If other key notes are used, 
further notes must be added. To meet all the requirements of 
our present-day music, we should need about fifty notes to the 
octave. To overcome this difficulty, the even tempered or chro- 
matic scale has been introduced. In this there are twelve equal 
intervals between the octaves. The interval between do and mi, 
the first and third notes of the scale, is called a third; that 
between do and sol, the first and fifth notes, is called a fifth ; 
and so on. 
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
171. Musical instruments may be divided into four classes, 
according to the character of the vibrating member. In them ! 
we have (1) vibrating strings, (2) vibrating rods, (3) vibrat- 
ing columns of air, and (4) vibrating membranes. Among the 
first class are found the piano, violin, banjo, guitar, mandolin, 
  Fre, 134.—SONOMETER 
and harp. In the second class come the music box, xylophone, 
and tuning fork. The third class includes the pipe organ, fife, 
flute, clarinet, piccolo, bugle, cornet, and trombone. As repre- 
setitative of the fourth class we have the drum, phonograph, 
gong, bell, and human vocal cords. 
172. Vibrating Strings. A string tightly stretched between 
two supports (Fig. 134) may be set in vibration in three ways: 
(1) by drawing a bow across it, as in the case of the violin ; 
(2) by striking it with a hammer, as in the piano; or (3) by 
ne 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
SOUND 167 — 
plucking it, as in the harp, guitar, or banjo. In any case the 
vibration of the string takes place according to definite laws. 
For purposes of demonstration a wire is better than a string. 
If we place a sliding bridge under the wire, the length of the 
vibrating part may be regulated at will. Experiment will show 
that a long loose vibrating part produces a lower pitch. A short 
tight wire produces a higher pitch. A heavier wire under the 
same tension and of the same length produces a lower pitch. 
Thus the pitch of vibrating strings depends on three things— 
length, tension, and size. 
173. Vibration of Strings in Segments. If we pluck the 
wire in the above sonometer at its middle point, the whole wire 
will vibrate and give off a 
note called its fundamental. 
If, however, we touch the 
middle to prevent that part 
vibrating, and bow the wire 
one-fourth from the end, it 
will vibrate in halves (Fig. 
135), the right half going up 
while the left goes down. 
The middle point is at rest 
and remains so even after the 
finger is removed. This point 
of no vibration is called a Fic. 136 
node. The number of vibrations of each half of the wire will 
be twice as great as before, as evidenced by the pitch, which is 
the octave of the fundamental note. This note is called the first 
overtone. By damping the wire one-third way from the end 
(Fig. 136) and drawing a bow across the wire one-sixth way, 
the wire will vibrate in thirds, giving us the second overtone.

remain on the wire, while the other two, half way and five-sixths

Fourtus way, respectively, where the 
vibration will be greatest, 
will be thrown off. By 
proper damping, the wire may 
be set in vibration in fourths, 
fifths, etc. (Fig.137), thereby 
producing successive over- 
tones or harmonics. As we 
shall see later, it is desirable to have a wire vibrate not only as 
a whole but also in parts at the same time. Bowing and pluck- 
ing are therefore never done at the middle, but near the end.

own fixed length. The strings 
are set in vibration by a felt- 
covered hammer controlled by a 
key. When the key is released 
a felt damper falls back against 
the wire and the vibration 
ceases. The pedals, loud and soft, are to increase and decrease 
the duration of the vibration of the wires. The loud pedal pulls 
away all the dampers, so that the wires continue to vibrate for 
some time. The soft pedal brings the hammers nearer the wires,

stringed instruments the waves set up by vibrating 
strings alone would be few and the sound wouli 
be thin and weak. In the piano, violin, mandolis, 
guitar, the strings pass over a bridge, which rest 
upon the surface of a sheet of thin wood called 4, 
sounding board. Whenever the strings vibrate 
these boards are set in vibration, and they, becaus 
of their larger area, produce a much greater effed. 
in setting up waves in the air. These boards it

present and by the proportion in which they are combined

with the fundamental note. Shape, quality of material, and 
arrangement of parts all enter into this. 
In the upright piano the sounding board is vertical. Because 
of this, and the fact that the piano is placed with its back to the 
wall, there is much less opportunity for the free outward move- 
ment of the waves than there is in the case of the grand piano. 
In the latter, with the cover raised and forming a reflector, the 
full volume of sound is secured.

VIBRATING RODS 
178. Vibration of a Rod One End of Which Is Free to 
Move. In the music box we find an instrument consisting of 
a set of metallic rods or teeth of different lengths, fastened at 
one end (Fig. 145). The free 
ends are set in vibration when 
snapped by pins projecting 
from a revolving barrel, and 
emit musical notes, the pitch 
of which depends upon the 
length of the rod. The shorter 
teeth emit the higher notes. 
In this instrument we have an 
example of a vibrating rod one end of which is free to move, 
while the other is fastened to a fixed base.

do not vibrate. We have here a vibrating rod with three vibrat- 
ing parts and two nodes. In the xylophone (Fig. 147) advan- 
tage is taken of such a mode of vibration. Bars of wood rest 
upon two supports which lie under the points one-sixth of the 
length from each end. When such rods are struck at the middle 
they vibrate, nodes forming where the bars are supported. By 
using a set of bars of proper length a musical scale can 1 he 
produced. 
180, Tuning Fork. If a rod such as described in the pre- 
ceding paragraph is gradually bent as indicated in Figure 1484, 
Fic, 148.—Tuntnc Fork 
the nodes come nearer together. If we use a bar of steel about 
ten inches long, bent so that the sides are parallel, and fasten 
a handle to the middle part (Fig. 1485), a tuning fork results. 
When the ends or tines of such a fork are set in vibration, the 
middle point rises and falls (Fig. 148c). 
When held alone the vibrations of the tuning fork make 
very little impression, but when the handle rests on a table, 
door panel, or other large surface, the vibrations set up in the 
table intensify the sound, just as did those of the sounding box 
of the violin. Such vibrations are known as forced vibrations. 
Owing to the fact that a tuning fork gives off only its funda-
-P-A-G-E-183
174 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
mental note, it is used as a standard of pitch for tuning other 
instruments. It is sometimes mounted on a box of definite 
shape and size, to get the greatest possible effect from it 
(Fig. 150). 
181. Vibrating Columns of Air—Resonance. If such a 
tuning fork as above described is held over a jar (Fig. 149) 
and water is poured into the 
jar, there is one time when 
the level of the water is such 
that the note from the tuning 
fork becomes quite loud. In 
this case the column of air is 
of such length that it vibrates 
in unison with the fork; that is, the sound wave 
passes down the tube, is reflected by the water, and 
returns to the fork in exactly the same time that it 
takes the fork tine to make one swing. The air wave 
thus reénforces the note of the fork and the phe- 
nomenon is called resonance. If this column of air 
is set in vibration by some other means, as will be 
explained later, it will in itself emit a note of the 
Fic. 149 same pitch as the tuning fork. If the tuning fork RxEsoNANCE ; . . : . 
is mounted on abox in which the air column vibrates 
in unison with the fork, the note resulting when the fork is 
struck will be much fuller than when the fork is placed on the 
table. As different sized tuning forks vibrate at different rates 
they are mounted on different sized resonators (Fig. 150). 
182, Sympathetic Vibrations. Very often when certain 
notes are played upon a piano, violin, or other instrument, vases 
are set in violent vibration. If two tuning forks of exactly the 
same pitch, mounted on resonators, are placed near each other     
 
-P-A-G-E-184
SOUND 175 
(Fig. 151), vibrations set up by one cause the other to vibrate. 
If the vibrations of the first fork are now stopped, the second 
will be heard still vibrating and giving off the same note as did 
the first. 
In this case the sound waves from the first box have set in 
-yibration the air column in the second. This results in the 
vibration of the handles 
of the fork, which may be 
shown by letting a sus- 
pended pith ball rest 
against the second fork.

If a piece of wax is 
put upon the end of the

. periment repeated, there 
will be no response on the 
part of the second fork, 
as the fork with the wax 
on it vibrates more slowly, 
_ and is no longer in tune 
with the first fork. 
Similarly, if the note 
middle C is sung into the piano when the loud pedal is on, 
the middle C wire will be found vibrating. Any other note sung 
will cause the wire of corresponding pitch to vibrate.   
  Fic. 151.—-SYMPATHETIC VIBRATIONS 
Such vibrations set up in objects, the vibration frequency 
of which corresponds to the note sounded, are called sympathetic 
vibrations, ‘

WIND INSTRUMENTS 
183. Principal upon Which Wind Instruments Act. From 
the above discussion of resonance and sympathetic vibration) 
it is easy to see that if a complex wave made up of waves repre 
senting different pitches should come to a certain   
resonator, the air column in it will respond only t 
> 
2 the waves of the same frequency as those that it woull 
a set up itself. A simple experiment with pill bottles oi 
various sizes shows this. When we blow 
across the mouth of the bottle (Fig. 152) 
it gives off its characteristic note; the 
smaller the bottle the higher the pitch. In 
this case, out of the various vibrations set 
up by the mouth of the bottle as the air 
passes across it, the air column in the bottle has 
responded to only one pitch. 
Wind instruments, depending for their action 
upon vibrating columns of air, are divided into three 
types, air jet, reed, and lip instruments. 
184. Air Jet Instruments. As representative of 
this type of instrument, we have the common whistle 
and certain pipes of the organ. In these (Fig. 153) 
the air passing through the tube ¢ of the mouthpiece 
is broken up and set into a fluttering condition when 
it strikes the edge of the lip L. The air column in r 
resounds to its own vibration frequency and a note Fic. 152 rr ie 
'

Fic. 153 
results. The pitch of this is determined by the length of the 
air column. In the flute and fife (Fig. 154) air from the lungs 
is directed by the lips of the player across an opening. The 
edges of the hole break up this air stream, as in the case of the
-P-A-G-E-186
SOUND 177 
pill bottle. The air column resounds to the waves of its own 
vibration frequency. In ordinary whistling, the mouth cavity 
  Fic, 154.—(a) Fire, (4) FLore 
forms the resonator, the lips setting up the vibrations as the 
air passes out. 
185. Reed Instruments. In the harmonica or mouth organ 
(Fig. 155@) a set of thin metal strips serves to break up into 
puffs an otherwise continuous stream of air that passes through 
an opening, The musical 
effect is similar to that 
produced by the holes of 
the siren disc (Section 
169). The difference is 
that the siren disc was set 
in motion by another force 
than the air, while the 
metal strip of the harmon- 
ica is set in vibration by 
the air itself as it passes 
through. This thin metal 
strip is called a reed. 
Figure 1555 shows how the air passes as such a reed J)” vibrates 
in the opening. By the use of strips of different lengths all 
the notes of the scale are produced. In this form of reed the 
whole effect is produced by the chopping of the air stream.

pitch result. In some cases, as in 
  the clarinet mouthpiece (Fig. 156), 
Fic. 156—Ctariner Movru- the reed does not swing through 
PIECE the opening. 
In the reed organ pipe (Fig. 157) the reed swings to and 
fro, as in the harmonica. The difference lies in the fact that 
there is in this a column of air B A to act as a resonator, and 
greater fullness of sound results. 
186. Organ Pipes. In the case of wind instruments the 
: vibrations of the air column take place in a direc- 
tion along the length of the tube instead of trans- 
versely, as in the case of stringed instruments. 
Inasmuch as organ pipes are made either with 
both ends open or withone end closed, 
they may be used as representative of 
all wind instruments. 
The tube (Fig. 158) may be used 
to illustrate the organ pipe. In this 
an open or closed pipe effect can be 
produced at will. Also the length of 
the closed pipe can be regulated by the 
sliding piston. With the open pipe 
the fundamental note is an octave 
higher than when the lower end is 
covered with the finger. 
If a small disc containing a light powder, and 
suspended by a rod, is lowered into a glass-   
  
-P-A-G-E-188
————_—_—_———__ sou ND 179 
walled open pipe while the pipe is sounding (Fig. 159), we see 
that the powder is agitated until the disc is lowered to a point 
halfway down the pipe. This is the point where there is no 
vibration of the air, and it is called a node. The vibrations are 
greatest at the two open ends and least at the middle. 
It is thus easy to see that each half of the pipe is 
vibrating the same, and that the pitch produced by 
the open pipe is due to only half of the column. 
We should get this same pitch if a partition were 
placed across the middle and the upper half removed. 
This gives us a closed pipe only half as long for the 
same pitch. 
Tia hole is bored through the walls at any point 
in an organ pipe, the effect upon the pitch is very 
nearly the same as if the pipe were cut off at that 
point. It is by means of such holes, which may be 
opened or closed at will, that the length of the 
vibrating air column is controlled and notes of 
different pitch are sounded upon the fife, flute, and 
clarinet. 
187. Overtones in Organ Pipes. In the previ- 
ous experiment only a gentle blowing was needed 
to get the fundamental note of the pipe. If now the 
  . . Fie. 159 
force of the blowing is slowly increased, there will  Grass- 
be a fluttering effect, followed by a second clear note, ‘Ona 
the octave of the fundamental. Our membrane will PIPE 
show that there are nodes } and ? way down. By proper regu~ 
lation of the force we may produce a second overtone, in which 
the nodes are 3, J, and § way down. The pitch of this is the 
fifth above the octave. In the organ this regulation of over- 
tones is called voicing.
-P-A-G-E-189
180 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
Representing these conditions by Figure 160, in which the 
distance between the curved lines represents the degree of vibra- 
tion of the air column 
at that part, we can say 
that the air column is 
a Second xertong Vibrating in halves,

successive overtones up 
to the fifth and sixth and even higher. 
Summarizing, open pipes vibrate in halves when giving — 
out their fundamental. They may also be made to vibrate in 
fourths, sixths, eighths, and so on, in even parts, giving octave, 
fifth above octave, second octave, third above second octave, 
fifth above second octave, third octave, and so on. As an 
example of open pipe instruments we have the fife, flute, and 
clarinet. 
188, Pitch of Pipes. The pitch of any given pipe is deter- 
mined by its length. Large long pipes emit low notes, while 
the short small pipes give out the high notes. This is true for 
both open and closed pipes. This may be demonstrated for the | 
closed pipe by means of the sliding valve as in Figure 158. 
As‘the length of the pipe is increased for lower pitch, the 
diameter must also be increased; for if the pipe is too narrow 
for its length, the air column is too easily broken into parts 
and overtones are more likely to sound than is the fundamental 
note. 
Tn all cases of wind instruments the material and shape deter- 
mine what overtones shall enter into the compound tone, which 
gives the instrument its characteristic quality.

SOUND 181 
189. Lip Instruments. In the trumpet or bugle, cornet, 
and trombone (Fig. 161), the puckered lips are placed across 
the mouthpiece. Air from the lungs passing through the slit 
thus formed sets the lips in vibration. The air column of the 
instrument resounds to these vibrations. The overtones are 
those of the open pipe. The length of the air column in the 
bugle is fixed. It is played by overtones only, beginning with

_ the second. From it are obtained sol’, do”, mi”, sol". In the 
cornet, there are loops in the tube. In these stops are inserted 
which are controlled by the fingers. In this manner the length 
of the vibrating air column may be changed by cutting off certain 
parts, and all the notes of the scale may thus be played. In the 
trombone, the length of the air column is regulated by a sliding 
part of the tube that may be moved back and forth, and the 
pitch is determined by this. 
190. Vibrating Plates. Gongs and cymbals are cases of 
plates in vibration. The pitch of the notes they emit depends 
on their thickness and area. In bells we have curved plates. 
They never vibrate as a whole, but in four parts when they 
give their fundamental note. In vibrating, the edge of the bell

these points and then at points halfway

Goblets may be set in vibration by rub- 
bing a wet finger around the edges. By 
changing the volume of water in the goblet 
we may change the pitch of the resulting 
note. In this manner a series of goblets | 
may be arranged to sound the scale and a 
tune may be played upon them. 
1g1. Vibrating Membranes. When 
membranes are stretched tightly they may 
be set in vibration. 
In the tambourine 
(Fig. 163) we 
have the simplest 
form of this. In 
the drum there

also in the case of a piece of grass held tightly stretched between 
the thumbs. In both instances a disagreeable noise results when 
air is blown through the opening. 
192. Phonograph. In the phonograph (Fig. 164) we have 
an instrument that reproduces sounds by mechanical means. 
This is brought about through a diaphragm placed over the 
small end of a tapering tube. Records of the sound waves

Fic. 164.—-PHONOGRAPH WITH HORIZONTAL 
DIAPHRAGM 
that are to be reproduced are made by concentrating the waves 
upon the diaphragm by means of a large horn attached to the 
tube. To this diaphragm is fastened a sharp pointed needle, 
which rests on a revolving cylinder or disc of wax. On this the 
vibrations of the needle make successive indentations when 
sound waves enter the horn and strike the diaphragm. The 
number and depth of the indentations depend upon the vibration 
frequency and intensity of these sound waves. Hard surfaced 
reproductions of this indented disc are made and sold as records. 
When such a record is placed under a similar needle and dia-

phragm, and is revolved, the point, as it moves up and down 
over the elevations and depressions on the disc, produces vibra- | 
tions of the diaphragm. These and the sound waves that are set _, 
up, correspond to the original ones that caused the indentations. 
In some types of phonographs the diaphragm is in a vertical 
position (Fig. 165), so that the effect upon the disc is sideways 
instead of up and down. The length of such a record is shorter

than that produced by the elevation and depression method, a 
the breadth of each line is greater. 
193. Human Voice. This is the most wonderful musical 
instrument of all3) for not only can the pitch of the note be 
changed at will, within certain limits, but the quality also can 
be changed. Here we find the vibrating substance to be a 
pair of membranes, called the vocal cords, which ordinarily lie 
loosely folded back against the walls of the windpipe near the 
opening of the pharynx (Fig. 166). When these are stretched 
tightly by the muscles to which they are-attached, a narrow slit 
is left. As the air from the lungs passes through this slit the 
membranes are set in vibration. The rapidity of vibration de- 
pends upon the tension upon them. The throat, mouth, and nose 
cavities act as resonators in reénforcing these vibrations. The 
quality of the sound emitted depends upon the size and shape
-P-A-G-E-194
SOUND 185 
of this combined cavity. The mouth cavity can be greatly 
modified by the altered position of tongue, cheeks, and palate 
(Fig. 167). In speaking, the letters used are divided into 
  Fic. 166.—(a2) Corps STRETCHED FOR SPEAKING, 
{4) Corps RELAXED FOR BREATHING ONLY 
vowels and consonants. Vowels are formed by the combined 
effect of one or more simple notes added together. Consonants 
ate called labial, palatal, or guttural, according as the lips, 
tongue, palate, or throat are 
used most in forming them. 
In all cases some vowel 
sound forms the basis of the 
letter. Speech is nothing 
more than a combination 
of vowel and consonant 
sounds, which when pronounced together form word sounds. 
Hoarseness is produced by a swelling of the inflamed cords 
and by a gathering of mucus in the opening between them. 
This interferes with their proper vibration. 
194. Difference in Voices. The quality of the human voice 
is determined, as in the case of all other musical instruments, 
by the number of harmonics that are present. The more of these 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
186 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
that can be brought out, the fuller is the tone. All singers seek 
by long practice to acquire control over the vocal cords and 
shape of the mouth cavity, thereby attaining great range in pitch 
and ability to throw the sound. 
The vocal cords in women and boys are naturally shorter 
than in men, with the result that women’s voices are of higher 
pitch. This accounts for the soprano voices of boys, which 
deepen with mature years. Even among women on the one 
- hand and among men on the other hand, there are variations 
in the natural length of the cords. Because of this we have 
soprano and alto voices among the women, and tenor, baritone, 
and bass among the men. 
MEMBRANES SET IN VIBRATION BY SOUND 
WAVES 
195. Telephone. In the phonograph, already described, 
sound waves coming to the diaphragm or thin disc set it in vibra- 
tion. In the telephone transmitter also, which will be studied 
later, a disc is set in vibration by sound waves sent to it by the 
person speaking. This causes variations in the current passing 
through the wire, thereby making it possible to reproduce the 
sound in the receiver some distance away. 
196. Human Ear. In the human ear (Fig. 168) is found 
the most perfect receiver of sound waves. It is through this 
that we are able to hear the many noises and musical sounds 
about us. Without it the sound waves would exist, but there 
would be no sensation of sound. This answers that question so 
often brought up as to whether there can be sound where there 
is no ear to receive the waves. 
The ear is divided into three parts: the external, the middle,
-P-A-G-E-196
SOUND . 187 
and the internal ear. The external consists of the cartilagenous 
projection on the side of the head and a passageway about 1} in. 
long into the bone on the side of the head. Its function is to 
catch as many sound waves as possible and direct them towards 
the drum, which is the dividing membrane between the outer 
and middle ear. To the drum is fastened, on the interior side, 
the hammer, the first of three bones joined together to form a

connection between the drum and the inner ear. The other two 
bones in order are called the anvil and the stirrup. This last 
fits into a hole in the wall of the inner ear. In the inner ear is 
located the organ of hearing, consisting of about 3,000 minute 
fibers, different in length and each capable of vibrating in sym- 
pathy with a certain vibration frequency. They form one _ 
terminal of the auditory nerve, the other end of which is in 
_ the brain. The whole chamber is filled with a fluid. When the 
sound waves coming into the external ear strike the drum, they 
set it in vibration. The bones of the middle ear communicate 
this vibration to the fluid of the inner ear. Waves pass through
-P-A-G-E-197
188 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
this, and each sensitive fiber picks from these the one to which 
it respectively corresponds and transmits the sensation to the 
brain. Here the combined effect of these sensations produces 
what we call a sound impression. 
197. Deafness. From the above paragraph we see that in 
order to hear we must receive sound waves and transmit to the 
brain the effect of these upon the ear. Now if any one of 
the three parts of the ear, the drum, bones, or nerves, is out 
of order, deafness will result. If the nerve is affected the deaf- 
ness is likely to be total. Sometimes the drum hardens and will 
not respond to the waves; sometimes the drum is destroyed. 
In this case the waves are transmitted in less degree to the inner 
ear and the deafness is not complete. 
REENFORCEMENT AND INTERFERENCE OF 
SOUND WAVES 
198. Beats. We learned in Section 169 that some notes, 
when sounded together, produce a pleasant sensation, while 
others produce a throbbing effect that is disagreeable. This is 
due to the fact that the waves corresponding to different notes 
  Fic. 169 
sometimes act in conjunction and sometimes in opposition to 
each other. If two tuning forks of the same vibration fre- 
quency (Fig. 169) are set in vibration together, a sound o!
-P-A-G-E-198
SOUND 189 
increased intensity results. If, however, the vibration frequency 
of one is lessened by fastening a weight to one of the prongs 
(Fig. 170), the resulting sound rises and falls in volume. The 
nearer to the end the weight 
is fastened the more fre- 
quent the pulsating effect 
becomes, until it is so great 
as to be quite unpleasant. 
These successive changes 
are known as beats. They 
are due to the fact that the 
sound waves from the two 
forks alternately reénforce 
and interfere with each other. As long as rarefactions and 
condensations of the waves are coincident, the resulting sound 
is continuous and intensified. But if a rarefaction of one 
sound wave encounters a condensation of the other, one counter- 
acts the other and silence 
results. In the intermedi- 
‘ate stages we have results 
of varying intensity. Let 
us represent a succession of 
Pr sound waves by the curved 
WAIST RAAT Tine (Fig. 171, I). That 
part above the horizontal 
represents the wave during 
Fig. 171 rarefaction and the part 
below during condensation. The farther away the curved line 
is from the horizontal, the louder is the sound supposed to be. 
Two wave trains (Fig. 171, I1), A and B, in which rarefaction 
and condensation are coincident will give the resultant wave C. 
  Fic, 170.—BEats 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
190 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
Should the two wave trains differ by one wave per second 
(Fig. 171, III), there will be one time where rarefaction and 
condensation are opposite. The result of such combination will 
be an irregular wave condition, loudest at the beginning and 
the end and least in the middle of the second. This alternation 
of intensity produces the beat. Now if there is a difference of 
two waves per second, two beats per second will be the result. 
and so on. The number of the beats per second thus coincides 
with the difference in the vibration frequency of the sounding 
bodies. In the tuning of piano wires, where there is a set of 
two or three wires for a note, any difference in the vibration 
frequency produces beats.. The tuner uses this principle as a 
means of determining whether the strings are under proper 
tension. 
199. Harmony and Discord. When the number of beats 
per second is 32, the effect upon the ear is most disagreeable 
and discord results. As the number of beats per second is in- 
creased, the discordant effect dies away gradually, until, when 
_ there are 72 beats per second, the ear is unable to recognize 
them. A single note, when sounding, alternates so many times 
per second that the rise and fall between rarefaction and 
condensation is indistinguishable. Two successive notes, like 
cand d or b and c’, however, differ by 32 vibrations per second. 
These two notes therefore produce discord as before mentioned : 
c and e, c and g, differ by 64 and 128, respectively, so there is 
no discord. 
In determining whether or not there will be harmony when 
notes are sounded together, we must consider not only whether 
the fundamentals are in harmony, but their overtones as well. 
The first overtone of c is c’ of 512 vibrations; the first overtone 
of e is e’ of 640 vibrations. These differ by 128 vibrations. In
-P-A-G-E-200
SOUND 191 
the case of the second overtones of 768 and 960, respectively, 
again harmony results. The same condition is present in the 
case of the first and second overtones of c and g, g and c’. In 
writing music, composers must either consciously or uncon- 
sciously take into consideration the matter of beats in the group- 
ing together of notes.

MAGNETISM 
| 200, Natural Magnets. In many parts of the world there 
is found a certain mineral that has the property of attracting 
( to it particles of iron. Because it was first found near Mag- 
nesia, Asia Minor, the name magnet was given to the substance, 
| its attractive power being called mag- 
netism. Today we call the mineral 
| magnetite. The ancients called it 
Lodestone, meaning “leading stone,” 
because, as we shall see later, when it 
| is suspended, it comes to rest with 
one end pointing always in the same 
direction, north. 
201. Artificial Magnets. In the A 
beginning of the study of magnetism, a 6 
artificial magnets could be made only F!¢._ 172-—(e) Horszsuox b Macnet, (4) STRAIGHT

the substance used for these, as it was found to remain magnetic 
longest. Today, through later discoveries, strong magnets are 
made more easily. These magnets are of different shapes, such 
as straight bar or horseshoe, and are called permanent magnets 
(Fig. 172). 
202. Poles of Magnets. Ail magnets have a strong attrac- | 
tion for iron; they also attract nickel and cobalt. If a natural 
or an artificial magnet 
is rolled in iron filings, | 
the latter cling most

  | points, generally at | 
opposite ends, with very few clinging to the parts between these 
spots (Fig. 173). These two places where the magnetic action 
is strongest are called poles. 
203. Poles of a Magnet Are Unlike. If a magnet is sus- 
pended by a thread, as indicated in Figure 
174, and left with no iron near, it always | 
comes to rest in the same position, in a north 
and south direction. If turned out of this 
position it returns. Furthermore, if the 
north-seeking ends of two such suspended | 
magnets are brought near each other, repul- 
sion between these like ends results. This ah 
also happens when the two south ends are | 
treated likewise. If, however, north and 
south ends are brought together, attraction 
results. We thus see that the two poles of re r74 Sus 
a magnet are different, and that like poles 
repel and unlike poles attract each other. The north end is 
called the north-secking pole and the south erid is called the

“ result like Figure 177b when the paper MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 195 
south-seeking pole. Such a magnet balanced upon a needle 
point gives us the mariner’s compass (Fig. 175) used so much 
for guidance on land and sea. 
204. Magnetic Field—-Lines of Magnetic Force. If a 
small compass needle is placed at various spots near a magnet, 
the direction in which the north-seeking 
end points will change. Near the south- 
seeking pole of the magnet it will point 
toward the magnet, Figure 176, I. Near 
the north-seeking pole it will point away, 
Figure 176, II. Midway between the two 
poles, provided it is not too far away from 
the magnet, it will point parallel with the 
magnet in the direction in which the south- 
  Fic. 175.—Mac- 
seeking pole lies, Figure 176, III. If we — NETIC Compass 
put the compass in various spots, making 
an arrow to indicate the direction in which © 1 
the needle points at those spots, we shall @ ® 
get a result something like Figure 177a. 
If now we take fine iron filings in place of 
a compass, sprinkling these upon a paper © 
spread over the magnet, we shall get a @ 
Fic. 176.—Compass 
is gently tapped. Here each iron filing is NuEpie Near 
pointing in some particular direction. 
There seems to be a definite relation between the iron filings, 
as they are arranged in a series of curved lines which are 
farther apart as they lie farther from the magnet. These lines 
are called lines of magnetic force, and all the lines together, 
of which those in the drawing represent a small part, are called 
the magnetic field of the magnet. Those shown represent only
-P-A-G-E-205
the external part of the magnetic lines. Lines are supposed to | 
pass through the magnet from pole to pole inside. They are 
not shown by the iron filings. An idealized drawing showing the 
external and internal magnetic circuit is found in Figure 177¢. 196 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS

Whenever iron filings or a small compass are placed in such 2 
magnetic field, they are supposed to take such a position as to | 
lie parallel with the lines of force at that particular spot where 
’ they are placed.

like poles when placed near each other. In this the lines pass 
  (@) MAGNETIC FIELD BETWEEN (6) MAGNETIC FIELD BETWEEN

across from pole to pole, thereby seeming to hold the magnets 
together in attraction. If two like poles are used, the result is 
like that shown in Figure 178b, where the lines do not pass 
across, but seem to mect 
half way, and then to pass 
sidewise, repelling, as it 
were. Figure 179 shows 
the effect when a horseshoe 
magnet is used. 
205. Permeability. A 
magnet can attract iron 
filings through most sub- 
stances. If sheets of paper, Fic. 179—Macnetic FIELD BETWEEN 
: PoLEs OF A HorsESHOE MAGNET glass, copper, aluminum, 
are placed between the magnet and the filings, the latter will be 
found adhering to the substance on the side away from the

198 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
magnet. The magnet will act even through glass and water to : 
attract nails placed in a tumbler of water. 
If a sheet of iron is placed near the magnet, filings are not 
attracted to the other side. The magnetic action seems to be 
obstructed by the iron. The lines of force, instead of passing 
through the iron, apparently go into it, resulting in an attraction 
of the sheet to the mag: 
net. A study of various 
substances shows that 
magnetic lines pass - 
through them in varying ) 
degrees. The tendency 
of the substance to con- 
centrate the lines is called 
its permeability. A sub- 
stance like bismuth tends 
to make the lines spread 
farther apart than they

READILY THROUGH IRON THAN 
THROUGH AIR 180 shows the effect of     a7] 
  / placing a piece of iron 
called the keeper over the poles of a horseshoe magnet. This 
allows the external lines of force between the poles a much easier 
path through which to complete the magnetic circuit. The mag- 
netic lines are supposed to point away from the north pole 
outside, and toward the north pole inside the magnet. 
206. Magnetic Induction. Many people are much troubled 
because, as they ride about in the trolley cars, their watches ; 
become magnetized and thus keep very irregular time. This is : 
because there is considerable steel used in the mechanism of 
watches, and in the presence of a strong magnetic field, such rf
-P-A-G-E-208
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 199 
as is found about the motors of the trolley cars, this steel becomes 
magnetized. 
That this can happen may be readily shown by bringing a 
soft iron nail near one end of a bar magnet (Fig. 181). Even 
though the nail does not touch the 
magnet, its lower end, when placed LN_ Ss p 
in iron filings and then lifted, will : . Fic, 181--MAGNETIC 
pick up some of the filings. If now InpucTIon 
the magnet is removed, the filings 
fall off. Furthermore, the lower end of the nail, if 
brought near a compass needle, will show the same 
polarity as the magnet pole that is acting upon the nail. 
The iron has thus been temporarily magnetized by the magnet. 
A hard steel needle treated in the same manner will show a 
similar effect upon the iron filings, though in less. degree. The 
iron is very permeable or susceptible to magnetic influence, while 
steel is not so susceptible. To get a better effect upon the steel 
needle, we must stroke it with one pole of the magnet, from 
_ the middle to one end, and 
then with the other pole from 
the middle to the other end. 
The needle thus becomes a 
permanent magnet, as is evi- 
Fic, 182—MacGnetTizED TAcK dent when the larger magnet HAMMER : 
is removed. 
We thus see that soft iron is easily magnetized, but does 
not stay so; while steel is not easily magnetized, but when once 
made so, it remains so. Iron has great permeability, while hard 
steel has great retentivity. The former is used only for tempo- 
rary magnets, while the latter is best for permanent magnets. 
Steel blades of knives and scissors sometimes become mag- 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
200 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
netized. Tack hammer heads made of steel are often magnet- 
ized, and they thus hold a tack until it is driven into the wood 
(Fig. 182). The phenomenon of magnetic induction explains 
why iron filings are attracted to a magnet. Each filing becomes 
a small temporary magnet, with opposite pole next to that of 
the attracting magnet. 
Small magnets, such as those in small compasses, frequently 
have their polarity reversed by being brought too rapidly under 
the influence of a strong magnet. Magnetic induction takes 
place so powerfully that the effect on the magnetic needle is 
the same as if the strong magnet were acting upon a piece of 
unmagnetized steel. Great care should be exercised in handling 
compasses to keep them away from such strong magnets, as a 
reversal of the polarity may mislead a person who depends upon 
a certain marked end of the compass as an indicator of north. 
207. Residual Magnetism. Soft iron does not entirely 
cease to be magnetic when it is removed from the influence of 
a magnetic field. It still shows a certain amount of magnetic 
action. The amount retained depends upon the hardness and 
the purity of the iron used. This magnetism that is retained is 
called residual magnetism. 
208. Earth a Magnet. The fact that a compass needle 
always points with the same pole north leads us to believe that 
it is arranging itself to point in the direction of certain lines of 
force, and that these lines of force are part of the field of a 
large magnet, the earth. This earth magnet has its poles in the 
northern part of North America, in Hudson Bay, and in the 
Antarctic Continent. The north magnetic pole and the north 
geographical pole are not identical, so that a compass will not 
point toward the north star on all parts of the earth, The 
north star is directly over the north geographical pole.
-P-A-G-E-210
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 201 
It is now plain to see why we call that end of the compass 
needle that points north, the north seeking pole. For if we call 
the north magnetic pole of the earth north, then the north-seek- 
ing pole of a magnet is really a south magnetic pole. 
209. Theory of Magnetism. What magnetism is, no one 
knows. Neither do we know what electricity is. This does 
not prevent our using both, however, and discussing what they 
will do, for we have found them exceedingly helpful in our 
modern life. 
If we break in two a long magnetized steel needle, we find 
that the two broken ends have poles 
where before, as one middle portion, 
they showed no indication of magnet- 
ism (Fig. 183). These two poles are 
opposite to each other and to the 
other ends of the magnets of which they are a part. 
Tf we further break these two, four magnets result. This 
process of breaking may be continued as long as the resulting 
magnet is long enough to be handled, two new magnets being 
formed for every one 
broken. From this re- ato [ine 
sult of breaking mag- oho hsete 
nets the following mPfmmoyane 
generally accepted 
theory about oagnets 
has resulted: all _pieces S 
of iron and steel, which © 
are what we _use_ for 
magnets, are made up 
of many~particles, each a magnet. These particles, when the 
iron or steel is in an unmagnetized state, are all jumbled together, s a D

f pointing in all directions (Fig. 184a). When brought under / 
the influence of a magnetic field of sufficient strength, these 
particles rearrange themselves so that the north poles all point 
in the same direction, just as do all the south poles (Fig. 184). 
Tn this condition the poles are acting together to produce at one 
end a north pole for the whole bar, and at the other end a south 
pole. We can thus see why such a magnetized bar when broken 
will give us two magnets.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 203, 
STATIC ELECTRICITY 
210. Static Phenomena. It is quite common for children 
in a playful way to scuffle over the carpet on a cold day, and 
produce a spark by touching the knuckle to the gas pipe or to 
some one’s cheek. A cat does not like to be stroked on such 
a day, as its fur crackles. Women combing their hair with a 
rubber comb “ feel the electricity” resulting and hear the snap- 
ping. A piece of tissue paper placed against the wall and rubbed 
briskly with the hand remains in place after the hand has been 
removed, If the paper is removed by a corner and held near 
the wall it will quickly go back on to the wall again. If held 
near the hand or face it is strongly attracted to them. In all of 
the above instances we have a phenomenon known as electrifica- 
tion, resulting in every case from friction between two different 
objects. This is a very common phenomenon wherever there 
is such friction. Cold, dry air is, however, essential to success 
in getting very striking effects from the experiment. 
For the study of this so-called static electricity, perhaps the 
simplest substance to use is tissue paper. A piece of glass and 
silk, or a piece of sealing wax and a cat’s fur, will serve. If 
the substances of either of these two pairs are rubbed together, 
the glass or the sealing wax, when held near light substances, 
like bits of paper or the pith of the elder wood, will attract 
them. The rods are said to be charged with electricity and to 
give up some of this charge to the small particles. 
211. Two Kinds of Charges. While the glass rod rubbed 
with the silk, and the sealing wax rubbed with the cat’s fur, 
acted the same on the paper and the pith, they will not act the 
same on other charged rods of the same material. If a charged 
glass rod is suspended in a stirrup supported by a silk thread
-P-A-G-E-213
204 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
(Fig. 185) and another charged glass rod is brought up, repul- 
sion results. A similar result is obtained if two pieces of 
charged wax rods are used in the same manner. If, however, 
charged wax is brought up to the charged glass, attraction 
results. Jn the same way, if two pieces of charged tissue paper 
are suspended near each other repulsion results. If two pith 
4 Sealing 
Wor

  Fic. 185 Fic. 186 
balls suspended by silk threads (Fig. 186) are charged by being 
touched with either the charged wax or glass, they fly off from 
the rods and then stay some distance from each other. We aze 
thus led to believe that the glass and the wax are charged 
differently when rubbed as described; also that like charges 
repel and unlike charges attract each other. The repulsion 
between like charges, and attraction between charged and un- 
charged objects, are most strikingly shown on cold, dry days 
when we try to fold a piece of tisstie paper, over which we have 
first passed our hands in smoothing it out. The two halves
-P-A-G-E-214
a 
Y \ MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 205 
persist in flying apart, and both adhere most aggravatingly to 
the hand. This action is much more marked if the paper and 
the hand are cold. 
The two kinds of charges are called positive (+) and nega- 
tive (—). Different charged conditions may be obtained by 
rubbing different substances together. While the wax rubbed 
as above with the cat’s fur was charged (—) and the glass 
rubbed with silk was (++), the cat’s fur was (+) and the silk 
(—). Asa result of experiments with different substances, 
the following table has been made out in which any article, 
when rubbed with any that comes after it, becomes charged (++). 
The other substance becomes charged (—). 
Cat’s fur, Wood, 
Flannel, Metals, 
Glass, Hard rubber, 
Cotton, Sealing wax, 
Silk, Resin. 
Thus glass becomes (+) charged when rubbed with silk, but 
(—) when rubbed with flannel or cat’s fur. 
212. Conductors and Insulators. If the hand is passed 
over the surface of a charged glass or wax rod, the charge 
disappears. Charged pith balls that are repelling each other, 
quickly come together if touched with the hand. The balls 
cannot readily be charged if suspended by a cotton thread, or 
if the silk thread is damp. Experiments in static electricity are 
hard to perform on damp days. We thus see that the electric 
charge can escape through some substances and not through 
others. These different substances are divided into conductors 
and insulators (poor conductors) of electricity. No substance 
is a perfect conductor or a perfect insulator. Among the best 
conductors are metals, salt solutions, acids, graphite; among
-P-A-G-E-215
206 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
the poorest are rubber, dry gases, silk, wax, amber, shellac. 
Some substances lie between these two groups in their conduct- 
ing power. Among these are cotton, linen, dry wood, paper, 
and the human body. 
Just as long as there is an insulator between two differently 
charged bodies, there will be no loss of charge; but if they are 
connected by a conductor, immediately the charges will neutral- 
ize each other, electricity passing from + to — between them 
through the conductor. Sometimes the difference in charges 
becomes so great that the intervening medium, generally a gas, 
‘does not sufficiently resist the passage of the charge. In this 
case a spark passes through the gas. Such a condition is present 
in the case of lightning, when the clouds and certain parts of 
the earth become so differently charged that a big spark passes ; 
generally from the cloud to the earth, but in some instances 
from the earth to the cloud, or even from one cloud to another. 
It. is in the passage of this spark that houses and trees on the 
earth are struck. 
That lightning is an electric discharge between clouds and 
the earth was proved conclusively by Benjamin Franklin, who 
flew a kite into the thunder clouds, using a hempen cord, near 
the lower end of which was fastened a silk cord, to be held in 
the hand. A metal key was hung from the end of the hempen 
cord a few inches above the ground. Sparks passing between 
the key and the ground showed the discharge between cloud 
and earth. The silk cord acted as an insulator, thus keeping the 
charge from passing through Franklin’s body. 
213. Difference in Potential—-Direction of Flow. When 
two objects or parts of the same object are charged differently 
they are said to be of different electrical potential. When con- 
nected by a conductor, the electricity is said to flow from the
-P-A-G-E-216
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 207 
place of higher to that of lower potential. This was what 
happened in Franklin’s experiment. The clouds and the earth 
were at different electrical potentials, and when the conductor, 
the hempen, cord, furnished a path, the current of electricity 
passed through the cord. 
Difference in electrical potential may be likened to difference 
in water level. Water flows only from a higher to a lower level. 
So electricity flows only from a higher to a lower electrical 
level (potential). There must be a means of transferring the 
electricity, just as there must be something to carry the water. 
214, Electrical Flow between Charged Bodies Is Not 
Continuous. That we get only an instantaneous passage or 
flow of electricity through a conductor when two charged 
objects are connected is due to the fact that it is not possible 
to get very much electric charge on a body by frictional means. 
If it were possible to keep renewing the charge on the object as 
fast as it passes off, we should expect a continuous flow through 
the connecting wire or other conductor used. Such a means we 
have in the galvanic or voltaic cell and the dynamo, to be 
described later.

CELLS 
215. Voltaic Cell. In the latter part of the eighteenth 
century, Galvani, an Italian physician, while experimenting with 
a pair of frog’s legs, by chance hung upon an iron balustrade 
the copper wire by which the legs were suspended. As they 
were swinging back and forth, a sudden jerking took. place 
whenever the lower end of the legs struck the iron balustrade. 
Galvani thus discovered how an electric current could be secured 
of cardboard soaked with salt 
solution (Fig. 187). As a result, 
a sufficient difference in potential 
Vouraic was Secured between the top zinc 
PILE 
  and the bottom copper to pro- 
duce many of the phenomena of static elec- 
tricity; but better than that, it gave a con- 
tinually renewed supply just as fast as the 
discharge took place. Thus came about the 
beginnings of our modern Voltaic cell, which 
consists of two different metals, preferably by other than frictional means, which was the only 
way known up to that time. Volta, another Italian, 
was the first to put this to a practical use, however, 
in the form of the voltaic pile. This consisted of a 
pile of copper and zinc discs alternating with each 
other, every pair being separated by a smaller disc

difference in potential results, and if the strips, called electrodes, 
are connected outside by a conductor, a current flows continu- 
ously (Fig. 188). The reason that there is a difference in 
charged condition between the two metals, with resulting differ- 
ence in potential, is that one metal is affected more by the liquid, 
and tends to dissolve more rapidly. Any two metals in the fol- 
lowing list may be used, the one coming higher up on the list 
being the (—) electrode. The current flows to it through the ~ 
wire from the other (++) electrode. :

216. Types of Cells. The commonest forms of cells in 
use are the wet sal-ammoniac cell, and the so-called “dry” 
cell. In the former (Fig. 
189) the solution consists 
of sal-ammoniac (ammo- 
nium chloride) dissolved 
in water, the electrodes 
being zinc for the (—) 
and carbon for the (-+). 
In every case the source 
of the electrical energy is 
the action of the solution 
on the electrodes. One is affected more than the other and 
gradually wastes away. In time it must be replaced. 
  Fic. 189.—SaLt-AMMoNIac Wer CELL
-P-A-G-E-219
210 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
In the “dry” cell (Fig. 190) the same materials are used 
tor the electrodes, the zinc forming the jar into which is packed 
the damp sal-ammoniac with the carbon 
placed in the center, surrounded by man- 
ganese dioxide. The top is sealed with 
pitch to prevent the evaporation of the 
water, which is essential to the electric 
action. 
The “dry” cell is more convenient than 
the other, but when once a hole has been 
eaten in the zinc covering, it soon really 
  _«Dry” . Fic. re Dry” dries up and becomes useless. 
In the wet cell, which has a glass jar, 
in which the liquid is placed, the solution may be replenished 
and the zinc renewed so that a longer use may be secured from 
it. The longer life more than makes up for the extra cost of 
this cell. 
217, Battery. Sometimes, as we shall see later, two or 
more cells are used together in a circuit. Such a combination 
of cells is called a battery. The term battery is often applied 
incorrectly to a single cell. 
218. Electric Circuit, Closed and Open: As long as the 
two electrodes of a cell are not connected, there will be no flow 
of electricity between them. They are, however, at a different 
potential, as can be shown by proper apparatus. If we connect 
them by a wire, a current flows through the wire outside and 
through the liquid inside the cell. The whole path through 
which the flow takes place is called the electric circuit. That 
part through the wire comprises the external, and that through 
the liquid forms the internal circuit. As long as the electrodes 
are connected so that the current flows, the circuit is a closed
-P-A-G-E-220
a MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 2It 
one ; but when the wires are disconnected anywhere, the circuit 
is an open one. The act of connecting the electrodes is called 
“closing” or “making” the circuit, and the act of disconnecting 
the wires is called “opening” or “breaking” the circuit. 
219. Polarization. If we examine the surfaces of the zinc 
and the copper as they stand unconnected in the dilute sulphuric 
acid, no action will be apparent if the zinc is pure. When we 
connect them by a wire outside the liquid, however, a layer of 
gas forms over the surface of the copper and bubbles rise from 
it. These bubbles are hydrogen 
gas that has been set free by the 
chemical action taking place in 
the liquid. Let us use a very 
large copper plate and a piece of 
zine wire (Fig. 191), connecting 
them through an instrument that 
indicates the current strength, 
called an ammeter. We shall Fic. 191—-POLARIZATION 
find, after they have been immersed a few seconds, that the 
pointer, which moved considerably at first, will swing back 
towards the zero mark. This shows that the current has weak- 
ened. The phenomenon is called polarisation, due to a weaken- 
ing of the current caused by the collection of hydrogen bubbles 
on the copper plate. Polarization is largely prevented in sal- 
ammoniac and dry cells by surrounding the carbon, which 
corresponds to the copper of the voltaic cell, with an oxidizing 
agent in the form of manganese dioxide powder. The oxygen 
of this combines with the hydrogen to form water. In this way 
the collection of hydrogen gas on the carbon is diminished. 
220. Local Action. If we bring the copper and zinc plates 
together outside the liquid while they are connected to the am- 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
212 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
meter, we find that no current passes through the ammeter. 
This is because there is an easier path for the current from 
copper to zinc, where they touch. Any easier path is called a 
short circuit. If we disconnect the zinc and copper from the 
meter, and make them touch inside, bubbles of hydrogen form 
on the copper, just as they do when 
the plates are connected outside. 
Commercial zinc, such as is used for 
cells in common use, is impure, con- 
taining considerable iron or carbon.) 
Consequently, when such zinc is 
placed in the acid, a current flows | 
between the zinc and the iron or/ 
carbon particles, just as between the 
zinc and copper when they touched 
Fic. 192—Locat Action inside the liquid, so that bubbles of 
hydrogen form, apparently on the, 
zinc, but in reality on the carbon particles in the zinc (Fig. 192). 
This action is called local action. It is prevented by amalgamat-, 
ing the zinc, a process in which the zinc is coated with mercury,” 
which covers up the iron or carbon particles without interfering | 
with the action of the zinc.     N N EN

MAGNETIC EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRIC 
CURRENT 
221. Oersted’s Experiment. If a small compass is placed 
in various positions about a vertical wire through which a 
current of electricity is passing, there will be a change in the 
direction in which 
the needle points. 
If the wire is passing 
vertically through a 
card (Fig. 193b) and 
iron filings are sprin- 
kled on this, they 
will take positions 
forming circles about 
the wire as a center. 
  Fic. 193 
This shows that there is a magnetic field around a current-carry- 
ing conductor. If the apparatus represented in Figure 194 is 
set up so that the wires lie in a north-south line with the mag- 
netic needle placed between 
the wires, a current passing 
through the upper wire from 
south to north will make the 
north end of the needle swing 
toward the west. With the 
current reversed, the needle 
swings toward the east. A 
current from south to north 
in the lower wire produces the opposite effect from that of a 
south to north current in the upper wire, the needle swinging 
toward the east. Likewise an opposite effect is produced when 
  FIG. 194
-P-A-G-E-223
2i4 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
the current is north to south, the needle swinging toward the 
west. An increased current produces a greater effect in all 
cases. Inasmuch as compass needles tend to point the same way 
as the magnetic lines of the field in which they are placed, the 
ae SAAN — Current Ly             ry rity

Fic. 195.—Macnetic WHORL 
conclusion from the above effects is that a magnetic field about 
a current-carrying conductor acts in the opposite direction on 
opposite sides of the wire. It is in the form of a whorl or bundle 
of concentric magnetic circles. These are acting in a right- 
handed, corkscrew fashion when viewed along the wire in the 
direction in which the current flows (Fig. 195). 
222. Rule for Determining the Direction of the Magnetic 
Effect. If the right hand is placed upon the opposite side of 
the wire from the 
compass needle, with 
the palm toward the 
wire and the fingers 
pointing in the di- 
rection in which the 
current flows, the 
thumb will be on that 
side of the wire to 
which the north end

223. Electromagnet. If a current flows from south to 
north in the upper wire of Figure 194, and from north to south

MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 215, 
in the lower wire, the effect on the needle is greatly increased, 
as shown by the greater swing toward the west. Thus if a 
current flows through several turns of wire (Fig. 197), the 
intensity of the field will be multiplied by this greater number, 
each separate turn furnishing its 
additional magnetic field. If each end 
of the coil is tested with a compass 
needle, one of them will be found 
to attract the north and the other the 
south end of the magnet. We thus 
have an effect similar to a magnet as a result of a current of 
electricity, even though no iron is present. Such a coil with the 
current passing through it is called a solenoid. Ifa piece of soft 
iron is placed in the coil, the effect upon the compass needle is 
greatly intensified, and the 
result is a magnet much 
stronger than any natural 
or permanent one. Such an 
arrangement, consisting of a 
solenoid with an iron bar 
or core, is called an electro- 
magnet. Other than the fact 
that it is much stronger, this 
magnet is similar in its action

  magnet, having unlike poles 
at its ends. Such magnets 
may be straight or horseshoe (Fig. 198). The strength of an 
electromagnet is determined by the number of turns there are 
in the coil and by the strength of the current flowing through 
the coil.

224. How to Tell the Polarity of an Electromagnet. If | 
the coil is grasped in the right hand, with the fingers pointing 
the way the current is flowing, the end where the thumb lies 
will be the north pole and the other the south pole (Fig. 199). 
Another way is to look at the magnet endwise. If the current

FOR ELECTROMAGNET 
is flowing through the coils in a right-handed direction, like the 
motion of the hands of a clock, that pole looked at is south; 
otherwise it is north (Fig. 200). 
225. Use of Electromagnets. The discovery of the prin- 
ciple of the electromagnet by Oersted revolutionized modern 
electricity ; for it has given us, among other things, the electric 
bell, telegraph, telephone, dynamo, and motor. 
226. Electromagnet for Surgical Purposes. In former 
years the only means of removing pieces of iron or steel that 
sometimes lodged in the eyes of persons engaged in the iron 
trades was the knife. Nowadays electromagnets are made of 
such shape and strength that it is a simple thing to draw out

a piece of steel through the hole made by the particle when it 
entered the eye or other part of the body (Fig. 201). 
hs di a a Fic. 201.—MEDICAL ELECTROMAGNET 
  227. Electric Bell. In the electric bell we have perhaps the 
commonest use to which the electromagnet has been put. There 
are two kinds of bells; one in which the bell rings but once 
when the current flows; and the other, called the vibrating or 
intermittent bell, which keeps ringing as long as the push button 
is pressed. 
In the single stroke bell (Fig. 202a), when the button B is 
pushed down, thus closing the circuit between the battery and 
the bell, the current continues to flow through the electromagnet 
just as long as the button is so held, and the iron bar or arma- 
ture A is pulled over and held against the magnet. The clapper 
strikes the bell once only, when the bar is first pulled over. Only 
when the push button is released can the clapper go back. Then 
the spring S pulls it back, because the magnetic attraction has 
ceased. 
In the vibrating bell (Fig. 202b), even though the push 
button is kept down, there is an arrangement in the bell itself 
whereby the circuit is broken. At the first contact of the push 
button B, which completes the circuit, a current flows through 
the coils, producing a magnetic effect that attracts the soft iron 
bar A and causes the clapper to strike the bell. This action, 
however, at the same time breaks the circuit at C, and the attrac- 
tion between the magnet and the bar ceases. The spring S makes
-P-A-G-E-227
218 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS | 
the bar go back, when contact at C again sets up a current in the 
coils and the striking process is repeated. This intermittent 
action goes on as long as the circuit is completed at the push 
button. 
In the iron framed bell, the iron base takes the place of the ,

wire from the clapper to the binding post. The binding post 
from which the wire to the coils starts and the support for the 
_ contact screw C are both insulated from the iron base. 
Fire alarm bells are sounded by means of a:‘hammer operated 
by clockwork. The clock works are set in motion by an e1ectro- 
magnet, which, when the current flows, releases a catch.

button, and wires for a-single bell circuit. In the case of two 
bells, front and back door, Figure 203b shows the most eco- 
nomical arrangement of wires. Here one wire from the bells 
to the battery suffices for both bells. Figure 203¢ shows the 
wiring with dining-room bell added. 
Sometimes one push button is used to ring two bells at the 
same time, one up- 
stairs and the other 
downstairs. Figure 
204a shows such an 
arrangement. 
In apartment

Battery Battery When any button is 
a 6 pushed, thereby clos- 
“ing the circuit, an 
electromagnet acts to release the catch on the door frame. 
The action is like that of the single stroke bell, with several push 
buttons on the circuit (Fig. 2040). 
22g. Causes of Failure of Bells to Ring. In most cases, 
failure of bells to ring is due to weak cells which need either 
a new zinc or a new solution. If dry cells are used, new ones 
must be bought. 
If the trouble is not due to the cells, there is probably trouble 
with the contact at the push button or on the vibrator of the     Fic. 204

bell. The least probable cause of trouble is a break in the wire. 
somewhere, unless it be at the binding posts of the bell, or of 
the cells, or at the push-button screws.

HEATING EFFECT OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT 
230. Heating Phenomenon—Fuses. Whenever an electric 
current passes through a wire, the wire becomes heated. The 
degree of heat depends upon the strength of the current, the 
size of the wire, and the composition of the wire. This heating 
effect serves many useful purposes, but it must be kept under 
control, as many fires have resulted from overheated wires. 
There is a limit to the amount of current that it is safe to 
send through a wire; for if it becomes great enough, the wire 
becomes so hot that it first glows, then becomes white hot, and 
finally melts. For this reason fuses are used on circuits. These 
are made of metal that melts at a low temperature, so that if 
the current becomes too strong the heat melts them and thus 
breaks the circuit before the wire parts become overheated. 
Three types of fuses (Fig. 205), called the open wire link, the 
screw inclosed, and the cartridge, are in general use. ‘The last 
two are the ones used in houses, as the danger from fire at the

instant the fuse melts is prevented by the fireproof casing in 
which the fusible metal is placed. Figure 205d shows a car- 
tridge fuse cut open to expose the fuse metal.

tric current flowing through coils of wire under the seats. The 
electric flatiron (Fig. 206) consists of a coil or a grid of wire 
  a . é 
Fic. 206.—{2) ELectric FLaTiRon, (6) Wirz Grip 
placed inside a hollow iron casing. The heat is radiated to the 
casing, that can thus be kept at a given constant temperature. 
Instantaneous electric water heaters (Fig. 207a@) consist of a 
coil in a metal casing, which gives up its heat to the water in 
which it is placed. Electric warming pads (Fig. 207b) have

232. Incandescent Electric Light. This light (Fig. 208) 
consists of a glass globe from which the air has been removed 
and inside of which there is a filament of carbon, tungsten, or 
tantalum ; the two ends of this filament are 
connected to the outside wires through pieces 
of platinum sealed into the glass walls of the 
bulb (see Section 10). When the electric 
current is turned on, the filament becomes 
heated to incandescence. The size and length 
of the filament affect the current strength, 
and therefore the amount of light obtained. 
We thus get lights of different brightness. 
The air must be removed from the bulb, 
because the filament would oxidize and soon 
be destroyed if any oxygen were present. 
The two platinum wire ends are connected 
to a brass disc and ring respectively. These 
  . 208.—INCAN- : Ee NT Eveen are insulated from each other. The whole 
TRIC LAMP lamp screws into a socket in which there is
-P-A-G-E-234
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 225 
a corresponding ring and disc, to which the ends of the two 
service wires are fastened. Thus the current flows when the 
switch completing the house circuit is turned on. The advan- 
tage of such a means of lighting lies in the ease with which the 
light can be turned on or off. 
233. Arc Light. The arc light makes our streets nearly as 
brilliant at night as in the daytime. This is brought about by 
the fact that incandescent particles of carbon, when heated 
to a white heat by the electric current, will jump across a gap 
  Fic, 209.—SimpLe Arc LicHt 
between the ends of two carbon rods, and produce what is called 
the electric arc. Such an arc is dazzling, and produces a light 
most nearly approaching that of sunlight both in brilliancy and 
color. Figure 209a represents such an arc light in its simplest 
form. The carbon ends are first brought together to complete 
the circuit. When they are pulled apart the current continues 
to flow across the intervening space, forming the arc. The 
carbons can be pulled some distance apart before the arc 
“breaks” and the current ceases to flow. Naturally the (-+) 
carbon wears away and the (—) carbon tends to grow. The
-P-A-G-E-235
226 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
result is that the (+-) carbon becomes hollowed, forming a| 
crater, and the (—) becomes pointed (Fig. 209b). If the car- | 
bons are exposed to the oxygen of the air 
while burning, there is a gradual wearing 
away of both, due to the consumed oxidized 
carbon, and the carbons must be renewed | 
from time to time. As the carbons wear 
away, the ends forming the arc must occa- 
sionally be brought nearer together, so that 
the gap will not become too great for the 
arc to be maintained. In projection lan- 
terns and in other pieces of apparatus, 
where the light is used for a short time, 
Fig. 210—Auromaric this can be done by hand; but on street 
FEED ake Laur, lamps, where the lights run for nearly all 
the night, the “feeding” of the carbons is 
done automatically by a system of electromagnets above the | 
carbons (Fig. 210). | 
234. Inclosed Arc Lamps. The latest of street arc lights | 
are of the inclosed type, in which the arc is inclosed in a nearly 
air-tight glass globe with an opening at the top. In such a case | 
the carbons last much longer, as there is very little opportunity 
for the oxygen of the air to get to the arc. 
235. Mercury Vapor Lamp. In this form of lamp, vapor 
of mercury is made the conductor between the two terminals. 
It consists of a long glass tube from which the air has been 
removed (Fig. 211). Through each end a platinum wire is 
sealed. The lower end consists of a receptacle for mercury. 
The (++) terminal of the supply is attached to the upper end, 
and the (—) terminal to the end containing the mercury. When 
the tube is brought to a horizontal position a thin stream of 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 227 
mercury flows to the other end, thereby completing the circuit 
just as the carbons of the arc light complete the circuit when 
they are brought together. If the tube 
is tilted back to its slanting position, 
an arc of heated mercury vapor forms 
throughout the tube as the mercury 
flows back. This arc produces a green- + 
ish light that lacks red waves. It is a 
very penetrating light and brings out 
shape and outline clearly. It is a 
cheap light and is therefore often used 
where the lack of red waves is not Fic, 211.—Mercury

236. Electrolysis. A glance at the table of electric con- 
ductors and insulators will show that water is neither a good 
conductor nor a good insulator. In fact, it stands between these | 
two extremes. Pure water conducts electricity very slightly. | 
Tf, however, we put some soluble substance like copper sulphate, 
silver nitrate, or lead acetate into the water, a good conductor 
results. Such solutions are called electrolytes, of which there 
are many kinds. 
When an electric current is sent through a dilute copper 
sulphate solution, a very remarkable phenomenon takes place. 
The name electrodes is given to the wires by which the current 
passes into and out of the electrolyte. The one by which the 
current enters is called the anode, and the one by which it leaves 
is called the cathode. If these electrodes are made of platinum | 
strips, in the case of the copper sulphate solution, the cathode 
gradually becomes coated with copper, and from the anode 
bubbles of gas arise. If the current is now reversed, the copper 
will disappear from the electrode that is now the anode, and 
copper will deposit upon the new cathode. If a lead solution 
is used, lead deposits upon the cathode; with silver, gold, and 
nickel solutions, silver, gold, and nickel respectively will deposit 
upon the cathode. If hydrogen sulphate (sulphuric acid) solu- 
tion is used, hydrogen gas forms at the cathode and oxygen gas 
at the anode. This is one of our means of determining that 
water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen. In all cases the 
metal travels through the electrolyte in the same direction as 
the current.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 229 
237. Electroplating. By means of the above process of 
electrolysis of solutions of metals, we have a method of deposit- 
ing metals upon other metallic surfaces. Silver, gold, and nickel 
plating are done in this manner. The object to be plated is used 
as the cathode in a solution of the metal to be deposited, and a 
bar of the solution metal 
is used as the anode (Fig. 
212). The purpose of this 
anode is to keep the solu- 
tion supplied with fresh  5itver 
metal just as fast as it is Anode 
deposited from the solu- 
tion upon the cathode. 
The current is allowed to 
flow until the desired thick- 
ness of deposit is secured, when it is turned off and the plated 
object is removed and polished. 
The process of electroplating has made it possible for people 
to have plated silver or gold when solid silver or gold would 
be too expensive. Such plated ware, whether of gold or silver, 
lasts many years before the metal deposit wears through. 
238. Electrotyping. Books are nowadays generally printed 
from electrotypes, which are copper-faced reproductions of the 
type as set up by the typesetters. The object of this is twofold: 
(1) to secure a harder surfaced type which will last longer, 
and (2) to avoid the expense of buying a new set of type for 
each new book published. All large publishers have a set of 
clectrotypes of every book on their list, so that at any time a 
new edition may be printed without the expense of resetting the 
type.

powdered graphite is brushed onto every part. This coated wax ( 
is then suspended as the cathode in a copper sulphate solution.

and hot water is poured over the front. This melts the wax 
directly underneath and the copper strip is easily removed. 
Over the'back of this molten metal is poured, which on solidify- 
ing gives the copper sufficient rigidity to stand the pressure of

239. Storage Cell. Of late years much attention has been 
paid to the storage cell because of its extensive use in the electric 
automobile, and in electric light and electric car power houses. 
In the household we find it of great use to the physician and 
surgeon. In the first instance, a light-weight cell was needed. 
The genius of Thomas Edison solved this problem, giving us 
today a storage cell that is very economical. In the case of power 
houses, the storage cells are used for reservoirs in which to store 
  Fic, 215.—(2) STORAGE CELL CHARGING, (4) STORAGE 
CELL DISCHARGING 
the excess electricity generated by dynamos during the hours 
of the day when little electricity is being used. In this way there 
is an extra supply to draw upon during rush hours, and the 
dynamos can thus be run evenly all day and night. 
In the storage type of cell we have simply what the name 
implies, a storehouse for electricity, not a source. Before it can 
be of any use the storage cell must be stored or charged with 
electricity, just as a coal bin must be filled with coal. In the 
process of storing, the electrodes, as used in this electrolytic 
cell, are changed to become so different that when the 
charging current is removed and the electrodes are connected
-P-A-G-E-241
232 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
through a bell, light, motor, or other piece of electrical appa- 
ratus, the cell acts like a source of electricity. A current passes 
out of it in the opposite direction from which the current passed 
through it when it was charged (Fig. 215). Just as soon as the 
cell has given out what was put into it, it will cease to act further. 
It must be borne in mind that electricity can pass through 
an electrolytic cell and change the character of the cell, perform- 
ing electrical work in so doing, just as a man may go up three 
flights of stairs, carrying something up the second flight only. 
He does work in climbing all three flights, but does most work 
in climbing the second flight, because on this he meets the most 
opposition. We must not get the idea that the electricity goes 
into the cell only and stops there. 
240. Lead Storage Cell. In the common lead type of 
storage cell the two plates are made of lead framework, into 
which a paste of lead oxide has been forced (Fig. 216). One 
of these is made the cathode and the other the anode, in a solu- 
tion of sulphuric 
acid. During the 
process of “charg- 
ing,” the hydrogen 
collecting on the 
cathode reduces the 
oxide to spongy lead, 
while the anode is 
further oxidized by the oxygen which collects upon it. There 
thus results a considerable difference in potential between the 
two plates. When they are connected through the outside con- 
ductor the lead oxide becomes the + electrode and the lead 
becomes the — electrode. On discharge, the positive lead oxide 
is reduced and the negative lead is oxidized, which is the reverse 
of what occurred during the charging process.       CPienetaesnesed

the process of charging, the nickel hydrate 
is the anode and the iron oxide the cathode. 
As a result of this charging process, hydro- 
gen forming on the iron oxide reduces it, 
while oxygen forming on the nickel hydrate 
oxidizes it. When discharge takes place, 
the reduced iron oxide is the — electrode, 
and the nickel oxide is the + electrode. 
During discharge the iron becomes oxi- 
dized and the nickel oxide becomes re- 
duced.

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 
242. Faraday’s Discovery. With the discovery made by 
Michael Faraday, about the middle of the nineteenth century, 
that a current of electricity could be set up in a wire by moving 
the wire in a magnetic field, there resulted a more important 
advance in our knowledge of electricity than that furnished by 
Volta in the discovery of the electric cell. It was Faraday’s 
experiment and interpretation that led up to the later discovery 
of the modern dynamo, by which electricity has been furnished 
in sufficient quantity to give us our incandescent and arc lights, 
as well as to run the motors of our sewing machines, trolley cars,

cells alone. 
243. Electric Current Produced in a Wire by Moving a 
Coil in a Magnetic Field. If a coil of wire (Fig. 218), with 
its two ends connected to a milliammeter,? is moved up to the 
north pole of a permanent magnet, a current will flow through 
the coil and will be indicated by the swing of the milliammeter 
needle. The current ceases to flow when the motion stops. If 
    
    Moving

BY MEANS OF A PERMA-— 
NENT MAGNET Fic. 219.—MILLIAMMETER 
the coil is pulled away from the magnet, a current in the oppo- 
site direction will be set up, the milliammeter needle swinging 
to the other side. The milliammeter, often called a galvanom- 
eter, consists of a coil of wire with a pointer fastened to it, and 
suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet. When a 
current flows through the coil the magnetic field set up in it 
makes it act like a compass. This is acted upon by the power- 
ful field of the magnet, and the coil turns just as if it were a 
compass needle, so as to cause its lines of force to lie in the same 
direction as those in the field of the magnet (Fig. 219). 
1 Such a coil, with its ends connected, is called a closed coil as contrasted with an open one, 
with its ends unconnected.
-P-A-G-E-245
236 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
If the coil is brought up to the south pole of the magnet, 
a similar effect takes place, only the needle swings the same 
way on bringing wp the coil as it did upon removing it from the 
north pole of the magnet. If now the magnet is moved into 
and out of the coil, exactly the same effects are produced as 
when the coil was moved, the direction of the flow depending 
upon whether the motion is up to or away from the coil and upon 
which pole of the magnet is used. 
244. Effect Produced by Using a Solenoid instead of a 
Permanent Magnet. If (Fig. 220) a solenoid is used instead 
: of the magnet and the 
above mentioned mo- 
tions are repeated, ex- 
actly similar effects as to | 
current set up in the | ee 
closed coil are the result.

ing -and Closing the

If now the current-carry- 
ing coil is placed near the 
other (Fig. 221) and the 
circuit is opened and closed, a current will be set up in the other 
coil even though there is no motion of the coils. 
In all of these cases the current set up in the coil connected    Fic, 221.—CurRRENT INDUCED BY MAKING

-P-A-G-E-246
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 237 
to the galvanometer is called an induced current, and the phe- 
nomenon is called electromagnetic induction. Inthe cases where 
current-carrying coils are used, they are called the primary 
circuits, and the other in which the current is induced is called 
the secondary circuit. In the first two cases, where a permanent 
magnet, solenoid, or electromagnet was moved, it is apparent 
that there has been a motion of the magnetic lines of the field 
about them. These have been disturbed or cut by the wires of 
the secondary coil. This cutting of the magnetic lines is not 
so apparent in the case of opening and closing the primary 
circuit, but if we stop to consider that the magnetic field about 
the primary coil appears only after the current is set up, and 
disappears when it ceases, it is easy to see that there is an interval 
in which the lines are moving outward on the closing of the 
circuit and inward toward the coils on the opening of the circuit. 
During this interval the lines are cut by the secondary coil, and 
it is then that a current is induced in this coil. 
246. Direction of the Induced Current. In the above ex- 
periments we found that the direction of the induced ‘current 
through the secondary coil was opposite on the closing from 
what it was on the opening of the primary circuit, and that there 
was a difference on the approach and on the separation of coils, 
or of the coil and the magnet. If the course of the secondary 
current is traced in each case, it will be found that it is such as 
always to present a pole toward that of the magnet or primary 
coil that is like it on the approach and unlike it on the separation. 
For example, if the north pole of the permanent magnet, sole- 
noid, or electromagnet is the one toward the secondary coil, the 
current induced in the latter will be such as to present a north 
pole on approach and south pole on separation. Where the 
primary circuit is made and broken a like condition results.
-P-A-G-E-247
238 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
247. Intensity of the Induced Effect. Close observation 
of the distance the galvanometer needle swings to the right or 
to the left in the above experiments shows that the faster the 
motion takes place, the greater is the induced current, as 
shown by the greater swing of the needle. Furthermore, if we 
strengthen the magnetic field, with the same rate of motion, 
a greater induced effect results. The field may be strengthened 
by sending more current through the primary coil. If the con- 
centration of the magnetic lines is increased by the use of an 
iron core, or by an increased number of turns in the primary 
circuit, greater induction takes place. Each of these changed 
conditions results in a greater number of lines being cut by the 
secondary coil in a given time. 
Inasmuch as the motion of the magnetic lines outward on 
the make and inward on the break of the primary circuit is 
almost instantaneous, we should expect and do get the greatest 
effect by the make and break method of induction. 
248. To summarize: 
1. Whenever there is a change in the magnetic field in the 
neighborhood of a closed coil of wire, whereby the magnetic 
lines are cut by the coil, a current is induced in the latter. 
2. The direction of the induced current depends upon 
whether the magnetic field about the closed coil is becoming 
greater or less (approaching or receding). In all cases it is such 
that its resulting magnetic field opposes the change. 
3. The strength of the induced current depends upon the 
number of magnetic lines cut in a given time by the closed coil. 
249. Telephone. One of the most useful inventions to 
mankind has been the telephone, which has enabled us to con- 
verse at a distance with one another and thus save much time 
both in business and in the home. In this the principle of elec-
-P-A-G-E-248
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 239 
tromagnetic induction finds, together with the dynamo, a most 
wonderful application. By means of the telephone, instantane- 
ous reproduction of the human voice and other sounds has been 
made possible. 
We have learned in the study of the phonograph (Section 
192) that sound waves set up by the human voice are capable 
of setting up vibrations in a disc, and, vice versa, that these 
sound waves may be again set up when the disc is made to vibrate 
by mechanical means. We have also learned that any change in 
the magnetic field about a closed coil will set up a current in that 
coil (Sections 243-245). Now soft iron is very permeable to 
magnetic lines, and therefore when it is placed in a field, as in 
| is Fic. 222.SIMPLE TELEPHONE CIRCUIT 
the case of a magnet keeper, the lines, instead of spreading out 
through the air, concentrate in the iron (Fig. 180). Any move- 
ment of the iron changes these lines. If a coil is placed over a 
pole of the magnet (Fig. 222), and an iron disc is placed near 
the end of the magnet, the lines, as they change, when the iron 
disc moves back and forth, will be cut by the coil, in which a 
current will be induced. If the ends of the coil are connected 
with a coil on a similar magnet pole, the current flowing in this 
second coil will alternately strengthen and weaken this second 
magnet, as the induced current alternates in its direction. An 
iron disc placed close to this pole will thus be attracted in vary- 
ing degrees, according to the changes produced by the vibration 
of the iron disc at the other end. The dise vibrations produced 
by the sound waves from a person speaking will thus be repro-

connected form a simple telephone circuit. Our modern tele- 
phone has been developed by the addition of batteries, trans- 
mitter, and transformer, mentioned later. For the present let 
it suffice to assume that the transformer intensifies the effect. 
The batteries give a current the strength of which is changed 
through induction.

of copper wire which rests against the carbon. By means of a 
thumb screw the pressure between the carbon and the copper 
may be very delicately adjusted, so that the slightest vibration 
of the base board will produce a change in this pressure.

Let us attach the secured ends to a cell with a telephone

251. Electromagnetic Induction as Applied to the Dy- 
namo. Since a cutting of magnetic lines is needed to set up a 
current in a closed coil,,a continuous cutting of these lines will 
produce a continuous current. Infact, if we rotate a coil between 
the poles of a magnet, we do get such a current, but it flows 
through the coil first one way and then the other, changing 
every half revolution. When the coil a b c d (Fig. 226a) is 
rotated in a clockwise fashion as indicated, a current will be 
induced that will flow in the direction abcd, so as to get 
a north pole on the right and a south pole on the left. The 
attraction between the south pole of the magnet and the north 
pole of the coil, and between the north pole of the magnet and 
the south pole of the coil, opposes the motion of the coil. When 
the coil has passed through one half revolution (Fig. 226b), 
c b is on top and @ d‘is below. During the next half revolu- 
tion the induced current ‘will flow in the direction ba dc. No 
matter which wire is en top, the current will flow down-
-P-A-G-E-252
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 243 
ward in the front wire a b, and upwards in the back wire d c. 
Let us cut the wire a b and fasten the cut ends to rings 
  Fic. 226 
(Fig. 227), and rest upon these rings strips of metal called 
brushes, which are connected to some outside circuit. When the 
coil is rotated we get a current flowing through this circuit first 
one way from 4 to y and then the 
other way from y to x, according 
as ad or be are above. Such a 
current, which changes its direc- 
tion as the coil rotates, is known 
as an alternating current. This 
sort of current has its uses, as we 
shall see later, but for many pur- 
poses a current that flows always 
the same way, as from a cell, is 
wanted. To get this from adynamo 
  Fic, 227 
as above described we must resort to a device known as a com- 
mutator. In this (Fig. 228) the ends of the wire from a and b 
are fastened to half rings placed one above the other. It can
-P-A-G-E-253
244 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
now be seen that as the coil rotates the upper brush will 
always be touching the half ring which is connected to the side 
of the coil that moves downwards, and through which the 
current is flowing toward this 
upper brush. The half rings alter- 
nate in passing under this brush 
as the coil rotates. The change 
takes place when the coil is in 
the vertical position. As a result 
we get in the outside circuit R 
what is called a direct or uni- 
directional current. The rotating 
coil is called the armature. The 
magnet that furnishes the magnetic 
field is called the field magnet. 
By making the magnetic field stronger or by using a larger 
number of turns in the rotating coil, or by making the coil rotate 
faster, we can increase the effect and thereby get a greater 
current in the external circuit. 
252. Electric Motor. With the development of the dynamo, 
making possible the use of electricity in large amounts, came the 
extended use of the magnetic effect produced by the electric 
current in the form of the electric motor, In this a current is 
sent first through the field magnet to produce field poles, and 
secondly through the armature in which poles are also produced. 
With the commutator segments and brushes so“placed that the 
magnetic lines passing from pole to pofe of the armature on 
the one hand, and those between the field magnet poles on the 
other hand, are not parallel, there is always an attraction between 
the unlike poles and rotation results. Almost any dynamo may 
be used as a motor. The direction of rotation with the same

of motor is, however, too complicated to be discussed her 
MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICITY 
253. We have thus far used such terms as quantity o! 
tricity, electric current, pressure, without making any a: 
to explain their meaning, on the assumption that for the purpose 
their meaning was understood. 
254. Electrical Pressure—Volt. At the end of Static elec- 
tricity the term difference in potential was explained as a differ- 
ence in charged condition, as a result of which a current flowed 
from a higher charged object to a lower charged one when the. 
two were connected by a conductor. This difference in potential 
lies behind the force that drives the electricity through the wire. 
This force is called electromotive force (E.M.F.) and is 
measured in terms of volts, after Volta. 
255. Electrical Resistance—Ohm. Inasmuch as in all 
cases where action results, some opposition must be overcome 
by some force, we speak of this opposition to the flow of the 
electric current, which must be overcome by the electric pressure 
before a current flows, as the electrical resistance. It varies 
greatly in different substances. The unit by which it is measured 
is called the ohm, after Georg Simon Ohm. The ohm is the 
electrical resistance offered by a column of mercury 106.3 em. 
long, of uniform cross section, and weighing 14.45 g. at a tem-
-P-A-G-E-255
246 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
perature of o° C. The resistance of a conductor in ohms depends 
upon four things: (1) its composition; (2) its length; (3) its | 
size (area of cross section) ; (4) its temperature. The follow- ‘ 
ing table shows the relation between the resistances of wires 
of the same length and size and temperature, but of different 
composition : 
Silver, I Zine, ‘ 3-91 
Copper, 1.06 Iron, 6.17 
Aluminum, 1.81 Lead, 13.87 
| The resistance of a wire increases directly with increased length; 
decreases with increased size. Just as more persons can cross 
a wide bridge than can cross a narrow bridge at one time, so 
can more electricity flow through a large wire than can flow 
through a small one. A hot wire offers more resistance than 
does a cold one. 
256. Electrical Current—Ampére. Whenever the elec- 
trical pressure of one volt overcomes a resistance of one ohm, | 
a unit current of electricity flows through the conductor.. This 
unit is the ampere, named after André Marie Ampére. Such a _ 
current deposits 0.001118 grams of silver per second upon the 
cathode in a silver electrolyte. 
257. Relation between Ampére, Volt, and Ohm—Ohm’s 
Law. When an electromotive force of one volt overcomes a 
resistance of one ohm, a current of one ampere results. This 
is known as Ohm’s Law, which in its more extended meaning 
may be stated as current in amperes equals volts pressure divided ! 
by ohms resistance. More simply: | 
: c= =z 
R 
Thus with an E. M. F. of 10 volts and a resistance of 2 ohms | 
a current of 5 amperes results. With any two of these three
-P-A-G-E-256
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 247 
quantities known, it is a simple matter to calculate the third; 
for 
c= = E=CR R= E 
R Cc 
In the above form R stands for the total resistance of both 
internal and external circuit, i.¢., that of the wire, lamps, or 
motor on the one hand, together with that of the source (battery 
or dynamo), on the other hand. 
For all calculations on the succeeding pages, which deal only 
with the commercial electric current as supplied to houses, 
R stands for the resistance of the external circuit, which is all 
that need be considered. The commonest form in which this 
resistance occurs is in the wires that go to make up the various 
electrical apparatus. Simplest of these is the wire of the incan- 
descent lamp. In this the resistance is very large and the heat- 
ing effect so great that light results. In some cases a heating 
effect of less intensity is desired, as for cooking, ironing, and 
for heating purposes. In other cases the heating effect is of 
minor consequence, and is a hindrance rather than a help; for 
in these the magnetic or electrolytic effects are desired, as in 
bells, in electroplating, and in motors. 
258. Measurement of Electric Power—Watt. In the 
measurement of the amount of electricity used, in order to 
determine the charge to be made the users, three things are 
considered: (1) the current, (2) the E. M. F. (voltage), and 
(3) the time interval during which the flow has occurred. Inas- 
much as the resistance determines the current, this, too, may be 
said to enter into the calculation. The number of amperes mul- 
tiplied by the volts pressure gives the unit of electric power, 
called the Watt. One ampere at a pressure of one volt yields
-P-A-G-E-257
248 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS | 
one volt-ampere, or one watt. If one ampere at one volt pres- 
sure flows for one hour, a watt hour results. Since a watt hour 
is a very small quantity, the kilowatt hour, which equals 1,000 — 
watt hours, is generally used. It is this for which we pay and 
in the terms of which bills are rendered. A current of 10 am- 
peres at 100 volts pressure gives 1,000 watts or 1 kilowatt. If 
this current flows for one hour, a kilowatt hour of electric energy 
has been expended. 
A current of 5 amperes at 220 volts pressure corresponds 
to exactly the same number of watts as do 10 amperes at I10 
volts pressure; for the products in the two cases (5 X 220 and 
10 X 110) areequal. A current of 1o amperes at 110 volts pres- 
sure flowing for one hour represents the same number of watt 
hours as does a current of 5 amperes at 110 volts flowing for 
two hours; for 10 X 110 X 1 hour equals 5 X 110 X 2 hours. 
259. Watt Consumption of Different Electrical Appa- 
ratus. The electricity supplied to houses is at a pressure of 
110 or of 220 volts. The former is the commoner, and it is on 
such circuits that lamps, heating appliances, and small motors 
are run. Incandescent lamps in use are those with carbon or 
tungsten filaments. They are nowadays rated according to their 
watt consumption. Formerly they were graded with reference 
to their candle power, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32, etc., candle power, ac- 
cording to the brightness of the light they give. Increasing 
candle power of course required greater watt consumption. For 
equal candle power the consumption of the tungsten lamp is a 
little less than one-half that of the carbon type. A sixteen candle 
power carbon light, requiring 55 watts, is now being replaced 
by the 25-watt tungsten light. The tungsten filament is, how- 
ever, much more easily broken than the carbon filament, and 
sucha lamp requires very careful handling. The current that  
-P-A-G-E-258
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 249 
flows through each of these can easily be calculated by substi- 
tuting the voltage 110 and the watts 55 and 25 respectively in 
the expression 
watts = volts X amperes. 
(1) 55 = 110 X amperes. 
ves = -5 amperes, for the carbon light. 
(2) 25 = 110 & amperes. 
Yrs = .227 amperes for the tungsten light. 
The following table gives the watt consumption of the electrical 
appliances mentioned :

cells stich as those used in houses for electric bell ringing furnish 
between 1.5 and 1.8 volts each. By joining several cells together 
higher voltages may be secured. (See Section 263.) 
The E. M. F. of the commercial electric circuit is either 110 
or 220 volts, usually the first. On the trolley car circuit, 550 
volts are employed. The new Edison nickel storage cell gives 
1.2 volts, The voltage of a charged lead storage cell is 2.

261. Series and Multiple Connection of Conductors. 
Since resistance increases with the length, joining wires end 
to end produces a combined resistance equal to the sum of the 
separate ones (Fig. 229). Such a method is called joining in 
  fn ee en ne nen een teen? 
Fic. 229.—WireEs JoINED 
IN SERIES Fic. 230.— Wires JOINED IN 
MULTIPLE OR PARALLEL 
series. Now if both ends of three wires are joined together 
(Fig. 230), each wire will carry its separate current, and we 
get as a result the same effect as would be secured by increasing 
the size of the wire. This method is called joining in multiple 
or parallel, and results in a combined resistance less than that 
of any one of the separate conductors. 
The greater the resistance of a wire the less current it carries, 
i. e., the less conducting power it has, under the same pressttre. 
The conductance decreases as the resistance increases. The 
unit of conductance is called the mho. This is equal to the re- 
ciprocal of the resistance in ohms, or 2. If then two conductors 
connected in parallel have conductances x and = the com- 
. . 1 : 
bined conductances of the two will be the sum of their separate 
conductances, since each offers a separate path for the current. 
uli equals their combined conductance, then Ptaiad Rx Rx R Ri 
By substituting the values of R and R, in this equation, the 
value of Ry can be easily calculated. For example, if two wires
-P-A-G-E-260
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 251 
of 2 and 3 ohms resistance are connected in parallel, the equa- 
tion becomes = =434+4. 
Solving: 6 = 3Rx-+ 2R, 6=5R, R, = 1 ohms. 
If the separate resistances are equal, then the solution of the 
problem becomes quite simple; as the combined resistance 
becomes equal to that of a single one divided by the number 
joined in parallel. (See Fig. 230.) 
We meet with just such a situation in the grouping of incan- 
descent lamps in houses (Fig. 231). The wires to which the 
lamps are attached are at 110 volts E. M. F. When an additional

lamp is lighted, the combined resistance is diminished and the 
total current through the wires increases proportionally. One 
way of arranging the lighting wires in a house is shown in 
Figure 232. Just inside where the main wires from the street 
enter a house, fuses are inserted so that if the wires become 
crossed anywhere in the house, thereby producing a short cir- 
cuit, the fuse will melt and shut off the supply. Otherwise the 
very large current and resultant heating effect produced by 
the large current flowing through a very small resistance would 
cause fire.

is an advantage to turn on the light from 
a switch on the wall instead of at the light

the mains passes to the switch first and an 
extra wire passes from the switch to the 
Jamp (Fig. 233). The key at the lamp is 
always left on. 
In case one wishes to turn a light on or

connections for such switches are shown in Figure 234.

is thereby, completed. 
263. Grouping of Cells. Although the 
zinc carbon cells furnish a higher voltage 
(1.8) than most others, being formed of 
metals far apart in the electrochemical series 
(Section 215), sometimes a greater pressure 
(electromotive force) is desired. In such a 
case two or more cells are: used together, 
forming a battery. They are then connected 
in series, the zinc of the first to the carbon of 
the second, the zine of this to the carbon ainesreres 
of the next, and so on (Fig. 235@). The car- CONTROL or 
bon of the first and the zinc of the last are 
thus free, and to these are fastened the wires that pass to the 
bell or other circuit on which such a grouping is used. The 
combined electromotive force is found by adding together 
the electromotive forces of the separate cells. 
Cells may also be joined in parallel, just_as electric lights. 
_ In this case the zincs of all the cells are joined together, and 
‘ the carbons are also joined together (Fig. 235). To the com- 
bined carbons and to the combined zincs, wires are fastened. 
These are connected to the apparatus to be used. The E. M. F. 
of such a battery is the same as of a single cell, the effect of 
such a grouping being the same as increasing the size of the 
plates. As a result, owing to the greater number of paths for 
the current through cells, the internal resistance of the battery 
is decreased.         CSS

connected in series, the carbon of the first one pressing against 
the disc of the lamp and the zinc of the last one being connected

265. Measuring Instruments. These are of three kinds. 
ammeters for current, voltmeters for E. M. F., and wattmeters 
for power. In all of them the magnetic effect of the current 
is the underlying principle involved; the magnitude of this 
depending upon the strength of the current. Such instruments 
usually consist of a coil of wire in the field of a permanent 
magnet (see Fig. 219). Indication of the magnetic effect is 
shown by a pointer which moves across a graduated dial. A
-P-A-G-E-266
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 257 
coiled spring becomes tighter as the pointer moves. This offers 
an opposition, which, on the one hand, keeps the pointer from 
moving too far, and, on the other hand, when the current ceases, 
acts to force the pointer back to the zero mark. 
An ammeter is a shunted galvanometer (Fig. 237), in which 
the conductance of the shunt is so great, as compared with that

of the moving coil, that a very small proportion of the current 
that flows through the instrument passes through the coil. 
Ammeters are placed on the line so that all the current passes 
through the instrument (Fig. 238). 
A voltmeter can be made of the same galvanometer as was 
the ammeter, by placing a coil of large resistance in series 
with the movable coil (Fig. 
239). The resistance of the 
voltmeter is so large that very 
little current passes through it. 
Voltmeters are placed across 
the line (Fig. 238), and regis- 
ter the pressure (E. M. F.) 
between the two wires of the 
line.

and ammeter. In 
this (Fig. 2400) 
the magnetic field 
is formed, not by 
a permanent mag- 
net, as in the case 
of a voltmeter or 
ammeter, but by 
the current that 
flows through two 
coils 4 A joined 
in series to the ter- 
minals EZ. All 
the current which 
passes through 
the lamps Hf 
(which represent 
the load) passes 
through these field 
coils. Thestrength 
of the field thus 
produced depends 
upon the magni- 
tude of the cur- 
rent used. 
The movable 
coilB isconnected,
-P-A-G-E-268
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 259 
as ‘is a voltmeter, across the line to the terminals F F through 
the springs CC. In series with this movable coil is a resistance 
D which prevents too strong a current flowing through the coil. 
The magnitude of the current through the movable coil depends 
upon the E.M. F. between the line wires. The amount the 
movable coil turns out of its position of rest depends upon 
the combined effect of the magnetic fields of the field coils 44 
and of the movable coil B, increasing with an increased current 
through either. A pointer moving across the graduated dial G 
indicates the product of what determines the strength of these 
two fields (amperes & volts = watts). There will always be | 4 current flowing through the movable coil B, just as long as there is any supply in the main line. It will show no effect on the pointer, however, because there will be no magnetic field around the coils 4.4 until a current flows through some apparatus, as lamps, a motor, or heating appliance. 
House wattmeters are of the recording type, in which the , “Pring are removed from the movable coil. A motor effect is produced and by a series of cogs the watt hour consumption is registered on a dial (Tig. 240b). For greater convenience the measurement is made 
| in kilowatt hours. To pre- 
vent too rapid motion of 
‘ the rotating coil, there are 
permanent magnets m,m, mM, 
which, acting upon an iron 
disc, retard the movement. 
266. Transformer. If 
we examine the poles on 
which are strung the wires that supply the electric light to 
houses, we see on some of them an iron box like Figure 241. 
  Fic. 241.—TRANSFORMER 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
260 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
To this box are attached wires, some of which are connected to 
houses near by, while others come along the poles from some 
distant source, the power house. These boxes are transformers, 
used to reduce the voltage of the current. Through these wires 
an alternating current is supplied whenever the locality is a long 
distance from the power house. To customers living near the 
power house a direct current is usually supplied and transform- | 
ers are unnecessary. 
A large current of electricity in the form of a direct current 
supply, when sent a long distance, requires a very large wire. 
Otherwise with a small wire there is a large loss of electrical 
energy caused by the heating effect in the wire. In proportion 
to the energy delivered at the end of the line, this loss is so 
large as to make the cost to the producer excessive. The loss 
in the wire is due to the large resistance that must be overcome 
in such a long conductor. 
Now the watt consumption is found by multiplying current) 
in amperes by electromotive force in volts. A large current at 
low voltage furnishes the same amount of electrical energy as 
does a small current at high voltage. For example, 10 amperes 
at 2,200 volts give 22,000 watts; 100 amperes at 220 volts also 
give 22,000 watts. If then a supply at 2,200 volts and 10 anv 
peres can at the end of the line be turned to a supply of 100 
amperes at 220 volts, we can use much smaller wires to carry 
the 10 amperes than would be necessary to carry the 100 anv 
peres. This change-cannot be accomplished when the direct 
current is used. The alternating current, because of its rapid 
surging first one way and then the other, back and forth throug! 
the wire, furnishes a constantly changing magnetic field. Thi 
affords a means of inducing a current in a coil placed in the! 
neighborhood of another coil through which the alternatin$| 
current passes,   
 
-P-A-G-E-270
MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY 261 
Referring to electromagnetic induction (Section 248), we 
find that consideration was given only to changes in the magnetic 
field of the primary coil. The secondary coil in all cases was 
kept the same, both as to size and number of turns. Let us now 
see what will be the effect of changing the number of turns in 
this secondary coil. Since the induced electrical pressure in the 
secondary coil depends upon the number of magnetic lines cut 
by it in a second, an increase in its number of turns will increase 
the rate of cutting and thereby increase the induced effect. Now 
it can be shown that if the two coils, primary and secondary, 
have the same number of turns, the electromotive force induced 
in the secondary coil will be equal to that between the terminals 
of the primary coil. If there is a difference in the number of 
turns, there will be a corresponding difference in the two electro- 
motive forces, the greater E. M. F. being in the one having 
the greater number of turns. An ar- 
rangement of two coils on the same 
iron core, made up of rings of sheet 
iron, is called a transformer (Fig. 
242). We have “step up” or “step 
down” transformers, according as = 
the secondary coils have a larger Fic, 242.—SIMPLE ‘TRANSFORMER 
number or a smaller number of turns 
than do the primary coils. In the case of the electric light 
supply the transformer is a “step down” one, the primary 
being supplied from the power house at 1,100 volts and the 
secondary delivering 110 volts (Fig. 243). This low voltage is 
necessary in houses, as the higher voltage is dangerous to human 
life. 
In a house itself use is sometimes made of a “step down” 
transformer as a substitute for a battery for ringing electric

267. Energy. We have learned (see Section 3) that the ’ 
cause of all changes that go on about us is energy. This energy 
may be due to the position of an object with reference to its 
distance above the surface of the earth, or it may be due to 
the condition of the object. A stone or other object above the 
earth is capable of producing effects upon other objects when 
it is released and allowed to drop. A coiled spring of a clock, 
as it uncoils, makes the wheels revolve. The energy in coal, 
when it is set free, while the coal burns, cooks our food and 
warms the house. Electricity that flows through wires rings 
the doorbell or furnishes us with light in the incandescent 
lamp. In all these cases we have what is called stored up or 
potential energy. 
On the other hand, a stone flying through the air will break 
a window it may strike; a hammer, when used for pounding, 
will drive a nail into a board; a tennis racket, when swung 
against the on-coming ball, sends it off in another direction. In 
these cases some moving object has brought about the change 
sought. Such energy of moving objects is called kinetic energy. 
268. Force. Thus far we have used the terms force and 
pressure in the sense of agents through which various forms 
of energy have brought about the changes described. In many 
cases only the qualitative side of this force has been considered. 
The quantitative side of it will be discussed more in the pages 
that follow. As it happens, forces are measured in the same 
unit as are weights. In fact, weights are forces. When we 
weigh things we place them upon something, which is thereby 
pulled or pressed down. The common means of weighing is 
the spring scales (Fig. 244). In it the coil of wire, or spring, 
is stretched by the weight of the object pulling down upon it. 
The spring possesses a characteristic known as elasticity, because
-P-A-G-E-276
MECHANICS 267 
of which, when the weight is removed, the coil returns to its 
former condition. The distance the coil stretches depends upon 
the strength of the force, and increases at the same rate. If we 
hang upon the hook a weight that represents the 
standard pound, the pointer will move downwards 
a certain distance. Ii we mark its position on 
the scale and replace the weight by one twice as 
heavy, the pointer will move twice as far; and 
with half the weight it will move half as far. By 
dividing the spaces equally, we can form a scale 
by which the weight of anything up to the limit 
of that scale can be determined. 
Energy and force must not be confused. 
Behind all forces is energy. Energy is a property 
or characteristic, while force is a representation 
or agent of energy, through which the existence of energy is 
made apparent. 
269. Weight—Gravity. What is weight? This can best 
be answered by stating that there is some force that attracts 
objects to the earth. If they are raised or carried above the 
surface they will return when there is nothing to keep them 
from dropping. There is an attraction that exists between the 
earth and objects on it, as well as between the earth and the moon, 
and between the earth and the sun. To this attraction of the 
earth for objects on it, is given the name gravity. The down- 
ward pressure of any object caused by gravity is called its 
weight. Different objects weigh differently because they are 
composed of different amounts of substance upon which gravity 
can act. 
270. Characteristics and Effects of Forces. We can have 
forces other ‘than those due to gravity, as we have already 
  Fic. 244
-P-A-G-E-277
268 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS | 
learned. While weight acts downwards always, these other 
forces may act in any direction. All forces must act upon some- 
thing, in some definite direction, and with a certain intensity. 
To these characteristics of a force are given the terms point of | 
application, direction and magnitude, respectively. | 
Sometimes the forces act alone, sometimes together, upon 
the same object. In the latter instance the effect produced will 
depend upon the direction in which they act. If they act in the 
same direction, the magnitude of the combined effect will be 
equal to their sum; as in the case of three or four persons pull- 
ing together upon a rope attached to a tree that is being pulled 
down. If they act in the opposite direction, the effect produced 
will depend upon which is the greater ; and motion, if it results, 
will take place in the direction in which the greater force acts; 
as when we lift a box, we must pull up with a slightly greater 
force than the weight of the box. Finally, if the forces act 
neither opposite nor in the same direction, the effect will be 
in the direction of neither, but will be between them, and its 
magnitude will be greatest when they are most nearly parallel 
and least when they are most nearly opposite. In all these cases 
a single force may be substituted to take the place of the two 
original forces. To this single force is given the name resultant. 
In the case of an overcoat that hangs on a form from a clothes- 
line (Fig. 245), the two parts of the line on either side are 
pulling towards the hook at each end, producing as a result an 
upward pull to hold up the coat. The two forces acting towards 
the hook are called components. They can be replaced by a 
single vertical resultant force which holds up the coat. 
Just as two or more forces may be replaced by a single re- 
sultant force, so may any single force be broken up into any 
number of pairs of components. The coat may be supported by 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
MECHANICS 269 
the same two parts of the clothesline, though they may 
pull in directions anywhere between nearly parallel and nearly 
opposite. The intensity of the two pulls will be least in the 
former, and greatest in the latter case. The reason for this 
   10 Ibs 10 lbs. 10) bs. 10 Ibs. 
FIG, 245 
is that when pulling in opposition they are not only supporting 
the coat, but are tending to pull against each other as well 
(Fig. 245). 271. Work. In all instances in which energy, either kinetic 
or potential, has been the means of bringing about a change, 
through its agent, force, work has been done. A change which 
involves motion of some sort must take place in order that work 
may be done. This change involves an expenditure of energy 
in overcoming some opposition known as resistance. The oppo- 
sition may be due to various causes, such as weight, friction, 
mertia, 
272. Friction. Whenever we light a match by rubbing its 
head across some rough 
surface, the head is 
heated sufficiently to set

the match on fire. In the metallic gas lighters used so much 
nowadays (Fig. 246), an alloy of iron and cerium is rubbed 
over a steel file, forming sparks, which light the gas. In the 
tinder, flint, and steel used by our ancestors, this principle of 
friction between two objects, rubbed or struck upon each other, 
was utilized. Friction is the resistance that objects offer to 
being rubbed one over the other. The act of overcoming 
it produces: heat. 
All surfaces are more or less rough (Fig. 247), and as one 
slides over the other, the projections on one alternately rise and 
fall over those of the other. The smoother the surface the less

and not on the ground. 
It is to reduce friction that 
floors are waxed for danc-       
    
ing; that drawer runners 
are waxed and wheel bear- 
ings are oiled. 
273. Sliding and Roll- 
Fic, 248—RoLLine FRIicrion ing Friction, We are all 
familiar with the fact that 
a carriage wheel rolls over the ground much more easily than a 
sled runner slides over it. This is because the friction between 
a rolling object and the ground is much less than that between a 
sliding object and the ground. The wheel, as it rolls forward, 
compresses the part directly under it, thereby making a little 
ridge ahead of it (Fig. 248). The act of piling up this ridge 
is an overcoming of a resistance that the surface offers when 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
MECHANICS 271 
it is compressed. The larger the circumference of the wheel 
the less it tends to make a depression, and therefore the less is 
the resistance due to compression. Furniture fitted with castors 
of large diameter can be rolled about much more easily than 
when fitted with small ones, because of this lessened tendency 
to make depressions in the floor.

8. Why does an old-fashioned iron nail hold two pieces of 
board together better than do wire nails? 
274. Inertia. Whenever we move anything from one place 
to another, we feel a certain opposition to the change. This 
opposition is greatest when the object is starting. After that it 
is less, and is due only to friction, so long as the motion is a 
steady one. We also experience a certain opposition if we 
try to stop a moving object, or make it move in another direc- 
tion, This characteristic of objects, because of which an out- 
( side force must be exerted upon them to start them, stop them, 
or change their direction of motion, is called inertia. The a a
-P-A-G-E-281
272 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
heavier the object is, the greater is the force that must be applied 
to bring about the desired effect. 
It is because of inertia of rest that a person’s head is jerked 
backwards when a carriage in which he is seated starts suddenly. 
The same is true when a person standing in the aisle of a street 
car facing the front of the car is thrown backwards as the car ' 
starts. In this last case the feet go forward while the upper 
part of the body, upon which no force acts, stays behind. 
Just as force is needed to overcome the inertia of a body at 
rest, if we wish to set it in motion, so it is needed to stop or to 
slow down a moving object. In the process of shoveling coal 
into a furnace, the inertia of the moving coal causes it to leave 
the shovel when the shovel is stopped suddenly by the hands. 
For the same reason snow or mud leaves our shoes when we 
stamp them upon the ground. 
Sometimes the effect sought is not to increase or decrease 
the motion of an object, but to change the direction. Here also 
force is necessary. Every one knows how difficult it is to turn 
around a corner quickly when running. A carriage or automo 
bile going rapidly around a corner tends to skid or tip ovef 
outward, and persons in it brace themselves against the outet 
sides of the seat. 
275. Effect of a Force Applied to Overcome Inertia. The | 
effect produced by any force in setting an object in motiot 
depends upon the point on the object at which the force acts | 
upon the direction in which it acts, and upon how quickly it 
acts. When a person’s head is jerked backwards on the suddet 
starting of a carriage, the force acts upon the body, not upot 
the head. The body moves, but the head does not. 
If the force acts perpendicularly to the surface, its effect 
is directly upon the object, which moves in the direction if 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
MECHANICS 273 
which the force acts. If, however, the force acts at an angle 
with the surface, the amount the object will move in the direc- 
tion of the acting force will depend upon the amount of the 
friction. The force here divides into two component parts, 
one acting perpendicularly to the surface, the other acting 
parallel to it. The rougher the surface is the greater becomes 
the effect of this force parallel to it, and the more the object 
tends to move in the direction in which the force is acting. 
As an example, if a hammer strikes a glancing blow upon a nail, 
it will not drive the latter so far into the board as when it strikes 
the nail squarely. Furthermore, the nail is generally bent, 
because of the horizontal component of the striking force. The 
rougher the head of the nail is, the more the nail will be bent. 
A piece of paper may be pulled from under a pile of coins 
without disturbing the coins, if the action is sudden enough. 
The force acting upon the under surface of the lowest coin is 
the friction between the metal and the paper, and is practically 
parallel to the two surfaces. This friction is not sufficient to 
overcome the inertia of rest of the pile of coins. For the same 
reason if a tray loaded with a pile of dishes is suddenly pulled 
sidewise when carried out of a room, the pile is likely to topple 
over, because the friction between the plates is so small. 
In stopping objects that are already in motion, the force 
produces the greater effect the more directly it acts in opposi- 
tion to the motion. In walking on ice or on a waxed floor, 
persons must exercise care by planting the foot squarely if they 
would avoid slipping. Dancers avoid the retarding action of 
the floor by purposely sliding about the floor. 
, The coal mentioned in Section 274 leaves the shovel for the 
| teason that the friction between the iron and the coal is not 
sufficient to overcome the inertia of motion of the coal. When
-P-A-G-E-283
274 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
the feet are stamped upon the floor or ground, the adhesion 
between the shoe and the mud or snow is not sufficient to over- 
come the inertia of motion, and the mud or snow continues to 
move. 
The effect of that part of the applied force which acts per- 
pendicularly to the surface of an object will depend upon how 
hard and rigid the surface is. A hard substance will respond 
to the blow and show a greater effect than will a soft, pliable 
one. Rubber tires on baby carriages are used for the purpose 
of lessening the jar. Pneumatic tires on automobiles are 
filled with air which yields readily to the sudden changes in the 
uneven road. Springs are put on carriages for the same reason. 
Here the inertia of the heavy body of the carriage is so great 
that the change in position takes place mainly in the tires and 
springs. 
Sometimes when water faucets are suddenly shut off, a 
bumping noise is heard. This is due to the inertia of the moving 
water, which is stopped by the 
Ar faucet. To prevent this bumping 
Cushion effect, air chambers are placed at 
the end of the pipe (Fig. 249) to 
act as a cushion. The force of the 
moving water is thus taken up 
slowly. 
Pneumatic door checks are used 
so that the door will shut more 
slowly, and not slam. The air cushion makes the force of stop- 
ping the door act less suddenly, so that a less intense effect is 
produced. 
In the case of making an object change its direction of 
motion, the force that brings about the desired change in direc- Fic. 249
-P-A-G-E-284
MECHANICS 275 
tion acts towards the center of the curve along which the change 
is to take place. The force, called centripetal (center pulling), 
is applied to pull the moving object out of a straight line of 
motion. The tendency of an object thus pulled to continue 
moving in a straight line is called centrifugal tendency. It is 
quite apparent in the case of water flying from the rim of a fast 
rotating grindstone. The direction in which the flying drops 
move is tangent to the curve of the rim of the stone. The mag- 
nitude of the centripetal force increases with an increased 
size of the object, increases with increased speed of the moving 
object, and increases as the direction of the path of the mov- 
ing object becomes more curved. 
An egg beater may be nearly freed from the adhering parti- 
cles by rapid rotation of the hoops. Clothes are often dried in 
centrifugal dryers, consisting of large revolving barrels with 
many perforations in the sides. The water passes out through 
_ the holes, as the adhesive force between the water and the 
clothes is not sufficient to overcome the tendency of the moving 
, water to go in a straight line. 
| 276. Shade Roller and Cream Separator. In shade rollers 
the centrifugal tendency of the two loose-fitting catches 
(Fig. 250), as the shade is allowed to roll 
up rapidly, keeps the one on top from drop- 
, ping into the slot. The slot does not rotate, 
since it is a part of the roller that fits into 
| the bracket which supports the shade. If, 
however, the shade is allowed to roll up Fis, 250 
| slowly, the catch drops into the slot and thus prevents further 
  rolling. 
( We learned that a greater force is needed to pull heavy 
| substances than to pull light ones from a straight line of motion.

From this it is easy to see that if a mixture of two liquids of 
different density, such as skim milk and cream, which together 
make up ordinary milk, are whirled 
together in a cylinder or tube, the 
cream will remain near the center 
and the skim milk will go to the 
outer part. This principle is utilized 
in the cream separator, by which 
the cream may be quickly separated, 
immediately after the milk is ob- 
tained (Fig. 251).

  277. Measurement of Work Done. It requires twice 4°: 
much effort to raise forty pounds as it does to raise twenty 
pounds the same distance. Furthermore, to raise twenty pound: 
twice as high also requires twice as much effort. We thus see
-P-A-G-E-286
MECHANICS 277 
that the work done, which is the result of the effort, depends 
upon how much force is applied and through how great a dis- 
tance it acts. Work done is equal to the force acting times the 
distance through which it acts, The unit of work is gener- 
ally expressed in foot-pounds, gram-centimeters, or kilogram- 
meters. Thus to raise one pound one foot higher involves one 
foot-pound of work. Two pounds lifted one foot involves 
2 foot-pounds. Two pounds lifted two feet involves 4 foot- 
pounds. 
In raising a basket of clothes weighing 20 lbs. to a height 
of 3 feet, 20 X 3 or 60 foot-pounds of work are involved. To 
raise a kilogram to a height of 4 meters involves 4 kilogram- 
meters or 400,000 gram-centimeters of work, If the force acts 
in another direction than upwards, as in the case of pulling the 
same basket across the floor, then the force required to over- 
come the friction is multiplied by the distance the basket is pulled. 
The force in this case is less in magnitude than when the basket 
is lifted, since friction alone is the opposition to be overcome. 
This is less than the weight. 
_ In all cases the work done may be calculated by the formula 
Work (W) = Force (F) X Distance (D). 
In the case of work done in lifting objects, the force is the same 
as the weight of the object, and the distance it acts is the height 
the object is lifted. The formula then becomes 
Work = Weight X Height. 
278, Work in Walking. In the act of walking the body is 
lifted at every step, and as a consequence work is done. The 
extent of work thus done depends upon how much a person 
weighs; upon how much he rises on his toes as he walks; and 
upon how long a stride he takes. A person taking long strides 
gets more exercise in walking than does another of the same
-P-A-G-E-287
278 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
weight who takes short strides. 
This is because the body falls 
‘ farther in the middle of a long 
stride than it does in the middle 
ofashort one. Figure 252 shows 
the relation between the drop of 
Fie. 252 the body in the two instances.

MECHANICS OF SOLIDS 
279. Downward Pressure Exerted by Solids. Every object 
has in a given locality a definite weight. The downward pres- 
sure resulting from this weight may, however, produce quite 
different effects under different conditions. If we walk upon a
-P-A-G-E-288
= 
os 
ee MECHANICS 279 
board placed upon a muddy sidewalk, the board does not sink 
into the mud nearly so much as one’s feet would if there were 
no board upon which to walk. The same force is acting in both 
instances, i. ¢., the weight of the body. The difference lies in 
the fact that if we are walking upon the board, this weight is 
distributed over a large area, with the result that on a surface 
under the board equal to that of the bottom of our shoes, there 
is only a small portion of the total pressure. It is for the same 
reason that we do not sink deeply into the snow when we wear 
snowshoes. The intensity of the pressure is what determines 
the effect on the surface pressed upon. This idea of pressure 
intensity, or pressure per unit of surface, as contrasted with 
total pressure, or pressure on the whole surface, should be thor- 
oughly fixed in the mind; for it is pressure intensity that is 
nearly always meant whenever pressure is expressed. 
280. Balanced and Unbalanced Forces. When two persons 
pull on a rope in opposite directions there will be no resulting 
motion as long as both pull equally. The two forces are balanced. 
When, however, one pulls a little harder than the other, motion 
results in the direction ef the greater pull. The two forces are 
unbalanced. All about us are conditions of balanced and un- 
balanced forces. When things are at rest the former condition 
exists, and whenever things are moving we know that there is 
an unbalanced condition. All changes are the result of un- 
balanced forces.

snowshoes than do men?

281. Machines. There are many things that cannot possibly 
be done with the hands, such as pulling a nail from a box, chop- 
ping meat, grinding coffee, sawing wood. We must resort to 
some contrivance to aid us. Even when it is possible to do the 
  
  a 
Fic. 253--SimPLe Levers 
work with the hands, we can often do 
it more advantageously with some im- 
plement, to which we give the name 
of machine. If we wish to take the a 
cover off a box, the easiest way is to pry 
it up with a chisel (Fig. 253a). The claw of the hammer makes 
it possible to pull out a nail (Fig. 2535). In these instances the 
simplest form of a machine, known as the lever, is being used. 
If we wish to get a barrel into a wagon, it requires less effort to 
roll it up a plank than to lift it directly, just as it is easier to walk 
up a long gradual flight of stairs than it is to climb a ladder to 
reach the second floor of a house. In this latter instance we are

using the second general type of machines, called inclined planes. 
Of the first type there are three classes, known as simple lever, 
crank and axle, and pulley ; to the second type belong the inclined 
plane, wedge, and screw. Every tool or implement in the house 
involves one of these two principles, the lever or the inclined 
‘Meat Press. Cutter,

plane. As examples of the simple lever we have the can opener, 
grass clippers, and tack lifter; of the crank and axle we have 
the bread mixer and coffee grinder; of the pulley the wheels 
over which the supporting ropes pass as a window moves up or 
down in its frame (see Fig. 268). An example of the simple 
inclined plane is found in a plank one end of which is higher 
than the other, or in a sloping road. The knife edge, axe, and
-P-A-G-E-291
282 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS | 
chisel are wedges ; while the meat press and rotary meat cutter 
are examples of the screw. In Figure 254 may be found illus- 
trations of the different classes of machines, 
Machines also enable us to employ other forces than human, 
such as in the case of a wagon pulled by a horse, the electric 
motor in the trolley car, the steam engine, the gasoline engine 
in automobiles. In all of these instances we find at least one, 
and generally several types of the simple machines represented. 
These are called compound machines. 
282. The Lever. In the lever in its simplest form (Fig. 255) 
we find a force (F) acting upon the machine, which in turn acts 
upon the resisting body 
(R). Here the lever is 
between the acting 
force and its opposi- 
tion. If F produces 
motion, R is moved 
the opposite way and the various parts of the lever move, 
with the exception of one point (O).. It is about this point O 
that rotation takes place. O is called the fulcrum, which remains 
stationary. We have thus two forces pulling in one direction 
and a third force acting between them and in the opposite 
direction. Let us support a meter stick at its middle point O 
(Fig. 256) by means of the clamp and the spring balance. Let 
us place movable clamps, 4 and B, on either side of O and note 
the reading of the balance. This shows the downward pull of 
the meter stick and clamps. Let us now place a 100 g. weight 
on A anda 50g. weight on B. If we place B at the 10 cm. mark, 
we find that 4 must be placed at the 70 cm. mark to produce 
equilibrium. The force F, acting upon B is one-half as great 
as the force F, acting upon A. The distance B O, however, is O Fulcrum rr 
     Acting 
Ry Resistance Force UF

MECHANICS 283 
twice as great as the distance 4 O. It is immaterial which of the 
two forces is called the acting force and which the resisting 
force. 
With the two weights 100 g. and 50 g. on A and B, the read- 
ing of the balance becomes 150 g. more than it was at first. 
No matter where 4 is placed with reference to the fulcrum 
O, B will always be twice as far from O to produce equilibrium, 
as long as the force on J is twice as great as that on B. Ifa

25 g. weight is placed on B instead of the 50 g., then the distance 
B O must be four times as long as A O, to produce equilibrium. 
The balance now reads 125 g. more than at first. In all cases 
the product of one force and the distance from the fulcrum to 
| its point of application is equal to the product of the other force 
and its distance. Furthermore, the single force recorded by 
the balance, which is counteracting the other two and pulling 
in the opposite direction, is equal to their sum. 
283. Rotational Effect of a Force—Moment. If in prying 
off the cover of a box with an iron bar or a chisel we take hold 
farther away from the fulcrum, we find that it takes less force
-P-A-G-E-293
284 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
to push down that end. The effect of the force in producing 
rotation about the fulcrum thus increases as its distance from 
the fulcrum becomes greater. 
To get the maximum effect at any given distance from the | 
fulcrum, the acting force should be applied at right angles to 
the bar. If it is applied at a slant, then only a part of it is pro- | 
ducing a rotational effect; the-other part of it acts along the 
length of the bar, either pushing it inwards or pulling it out- 
wards, In calculating the rotational effect, the perpendicular

distance from the axis or fulcrum to the line of direction in 
which the force acts is what is used. This is called the force arm 
(Fig. 257). The product of the acting force and this force 
arm is called the moment of the acting force. Likewise the 
product of the resistance and the resistance arm is the moment 
of the resistance. 
Moments that tend to produce rotation like the motion of 
the clock hands are called positive, and contrary to them, nega- 
tive moments. When the positive and negative moments are 
equal, no rotation results. Thus, in order to cause changes with 
a machine like the lever, the acting force must produce a moment 
slightly greater than does the resistance. For purposes of dis 
cussion, however, the law of the lever may be expressed as 
Acting force X force arm = Resistance & resistance arm.

MECHANICS 285 
If a force of 20 lbs. acts upon the bar A O-B at the point B 
(Fig. 258), until the bar reaches the position 4’ O B’, then while 
B has moved through 6 inches the weight of 80 pounds at A 
has been raised only $ of 6 inches, or 14 inches. Since B is 
4 times as far from the axis O as is 4, and the force needed at 
B, to move 8o Ibs. at A, is only 4 as great, it must act through 
4 times the distance that the 80 Ibs. is moved. ‘The work ex-

pended upon the lever by the force of 20 Ibs. at B (20 X 6) is 
practically equal to the work done by the lever, (80 X 14) ; but, 
owing to friction at the fulcrum, it is slightly greater, so that 
we never get from a machine as much as we put into it. For 
purposes of discussion the general law of machines is force times 
the distance it acts is equal to the resistance times the distance 
it is overcome. F X Fd =R & Rd. 
284. Types of Levers. It is easy to see that any one of the 
three forces may be made the fulcrum of a lever. There are 
three ways in which this may be done, which give us the 
three types of levers (Fig. 259). One of the forces always 
acts in opposition to the other two, with its point of applica- 
tion between them, and it is equal to their sum. In all cases 
AF X arm = R X arm.

are two types of weighing scales in general 
use (Fig. 264). In one, (a), the arms are 
of equal length; the object to be weighed is 
placed upon one pan and weights equal to it 
are placed upon the other pan. Such a method 
of weighing is called counterbalancing. In 
the second type, (b), there is one pan; and 
a weight is moved back and forth on a gradu- 
ated beam until balance is secured, when the 
weight of the object-is read from the gradu- 
  Fic. 263 
ated beam. On the 
left side of the ful- 
crum the length of 
the arm remains 
always the same, 
and the weight

On the right side 
the movable weight 
remains the same, 
but the length of

The object sought in the development of modern machines i 
to reduce as much as possible the loss that is due to frictiot 
between the parts. The relation between the work done by !

288. Screw. In this machine, as exemplified in the vise and 
the letter press (Fig. 268), the object sought is one of greatly 
increased pressure. The acting force passes through a consider- 
able distance, while the resistance is overcome through a short 
distance. When the handle of the vise or the letter press is 
turned once, the screw advances the distance between two suc- 
cessive threads. This distance is called the pitch of the screw- 
  | Fic. 268.—ExAMPLES OF THE SCREW, (a) VISE, (4) LETTER PRESS 
thread. The distance the acting force moves is the circumfer- 
ence of a circle. This is considerable as compared with the 
pitch of the screw, so that whatever force is applied to the handle 
| is greatly multiplied. 
  The loss due to friction in a screw is much larger than in 
any other type of machine, as the resistance acts over a con- 
siderable surface of the screw thread.

Sometimes a force greater than can be applied directly by 
the hands is desired; as when we cut metal, crack nuts, grind 
coffee, squeeze juice from fruit or meat, clamp two glued boards 
together, raise heavy weights, such as safes or pianos. Some- 
times great speed is desired, as in 
the bicycle, sewing machine, knife

upon other forces than muscular, | See

If we wish to overcome a large 
resistance, we make the force arm

  shears, the coffee grinder, and the 
fruit press. If the force arm is 
three times as long as the resistance arm, then the resistance 
overcome will be three times as great as the acting force. 
Tf, on the other hand, we wish greater speed than can be 
attained directly with the hands, we make the force arm short | 
and the resistance arm long; as in the paper cutting shears, the | 
sewing machine, and the grindstone. If the resistance arm is 
three times as long as the acting force arm, then the resistance 
will be moved through three times as great a distance as the 
acting force moves. The intensity of the resistance will, how- 
ever, be only one-third as great as that of the acting force. 
The ratio that expresses the gain, whether it be in force 
intensity or in speed, is called the mechanical advantage of the 
machine.

In all cases the work expended equals work done by the 
machine plus waste work. The less the waste work becomes, 
the more nearly does the work done by the machine approach 
the work expended, and the greater becomes the efficiency of the 
machine.

  290. Center of Gravity. We have learned that all objects 
when taken above the earth show by their downward pressure 
a tendency to return to the surface of the earth. If we remove 
the ground from under them, as in digging a hole, they will drop 
into this. There thus seems to be an attraction deeper than the 
surface. Furthermore, a box resting on end on the earth will; 
if tilted sufficiently, fall over on its side. A person will fall 
over if he loses his balance. We infer then that the attraction 
between the earth and objects is between a certain part of the 
earth and of the object. This point in an object upon which 
the force of gravity seems to act is called the center of gravity. 
We shall see that the center of gravity of any object tends to 
get as near the center of the earth as possible. This condition
-P-A-G-E-305
296 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
is reached in the case of any object lying upon the surface of 
the earth when the center of gravity of the object is as low as 
possible. . 
When a weight is held by a string, the string hangs ina 
vertical or plumb line. If a pin is put successively through the 
holes 4, B, C, of a card (Fig. 273a), the card will assume differ- 
ent positions and the plumb line from the pin will pass suc- 
cessively along the lines 4 4’, BB’, CC’. All three of these 
  Fic. 273 | 
lines pass through Q. If the pin is placed through O, the card | 
will remain in any position to which it is turned. We may look 
at any object as made up of many particles, all of which are 
pulled downwards by gravity. When the pin is placed through 
A, these combined forces (Fig. 273b) act to produce negative 
rotation about 4. When the pin passes through B, positive 
rotation results. When O is the point used, there are as many 
forces acting to produce positive, as to produce negative rota- 
tion. In other words, O is the point of application of the single 
force that takes the place of all the forces of gravity on the 
object. The pin acts upwards against this, and the two forces 
being equal and opposite, no motion results. The plumb line
-P-A-G-E-306
. MECHANICS | 207 
which connects the center of gravity of an object with the center 
of earth is called the line of direction. In solid objects that are 
uniform in shape, like the cube, rectangular block, or sphere, 
the center of gravity is at the same point as the geometrical 
center. If the objects are not symmetrical or are made up of 
different ‘materials, it will lie near the heavier part. In some 
instances the center of gravity lies in space outside of the 
material part of the object, as in the case of a ring, stool, box, 
or bottle. Sometimes it may lie much below the support; as in 
the pendulum of the clock. 
291. Equilibrium—Stability, A mucilagebottle “stays put” 
much better than a salt shaker (Fig. 274). A person standing 
with feet spread 
apart is much more 
difficult to push over 
than one with heels 
together. It is much

walk whea she can

thing to keep her sar § —) ER balance. Balance Fic. 274.—MucILacz Borre, SALT SHAK! D 
    
of support the object has. 
The area formed by the lines connecting the points of sup- 
port of any object is called its base: ‘Thus the base of a chair 
is nearly a square ; of a table it is a rectangle, square, or triangle ; 
| of a three-legged stool it is a triangle; of a bicycle when being 
. | and resulting equilibrium and stability depend upon the extent 
) 
  ridden it is a broad line connecting the points where the front

| Point ; of a cylindrical pencil on its broad end it is a circle, on
-P-A-G-E-307
298 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
its side a straight line, and on its sharpened end a point. It is 
very easily seen that if the line of direction passes through the ‘ 
base, equilibrium results. To illustrate this, take the toy called 
the leaning tower (Fig. 275). As long as the top is off, the 
center of gravity of the remainder is at C and the line of direc- 
tion passes between a and b. When the top is put on, the center 
of gravity of the whole tower is at D, so that it topples over, as 
the line of direction falls outside of ab and negative rotation 
results. In the case of 
the leaning tower of 
Pisa (Fig. 93), the 
line of direction falls 
well within the base. 
When a person leans 
over or raises one foot 
forward without at 
the same time moving 
the upper part of the 
body backward, his 
center of gravity is thrown forward and a fall will result if the 
foot is not put upon the ground in order to change his base so 
that the line of direction passes within it. The act of walking 
is a series of falls thus checked. A person must always lean 
forward considerably when he starts to run. 
The stability of anything, which determines its tendency to 
upset, depends upon how much work must be done to get its 
center of gravity to a point where, when released, it will of 
its own accord fall to a lower position. If the line of direction 
already passes outside of the base the object will need no force 
to aid it in falling. Such a condition exists in the case of a lead 
pencil on its point. The object is in an unstable condition. In 
  Fic. 275 LEANING TOWER
-P-A-G-E-308
MECHANICS 299 
all feats of balancing performed by jugglers, the performer’s 
skill is shown in his ability to keep the base under the center of 
gravity of the articles he supports. While apparently in equilib- 
Tium, the objects are really in a very unstable condition. 
Of the two pitchers (Fig. 276), weighing the same, the first 
will be the more difficult to tip over, as the center of gravity 
is lower and must there- 
fore be raised through a 
greater height as it is tilted 
about O to the position, 
where it will fall over. 
Objects with low center of 
gravity and broad base are 
the most stable. For this 
      o 
  a 
reason lamps are generally ,, 276.—(a) Is More STABLE THAN (6) 
made with the lower part 
heavy. An object is called “top heavy” and is easily upset 
when the center of gravity is very high. 
Aged and infirm people use canes to support them when they 
walk, as the cane acts like a third foot to increase the area of 
the base. If a person is carrying a pail of water in the right 
hand, he must lean to the left, as the pail of 
‘water throws the center of gravity of the body 
and the pail of water together over to the right, 
thereby decreasing the stability of his body, 
the base of which remains the same. 
292. Sagging of Doors. Doors are usually 
supported by two hinges, on the side, one near 
the top and the other near the bottom. The 
weight of the door acts downwards at its center 
of gravity (Fig. 277). The upper hinge must
-P-A-G-E-309
300 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
pull inwards. The lower hinge must push outwards. For this 
reason it is more important to have the upper hinge securely 
fastened to the framework. In the same way, the upper screw 
of a wall bracket should be the more secure. 
The rotational downward effect produced by the weight of 
the door at the center of gravity tends to produce a sagging 
of the outer edge (Fig. 2784). This makes the diagonal ab 
. from the top of 
the hinged side 
to the bottom of 
the latch side longer 
than the other 
diagonal c d. To 
prevent this sag- 
ging, a brace in the 
form of a strip of 
‘metal should be 
fastened across the 
diagonal a b that 
increases in length, 
so as to prevent this 
pulling apart of the 
corners. This sag- 
ging effect is par- 
ticularly likely with long gates. To prevent it, sometimes the 
end next the hinges is made higher and a piece of board is 
nailed diagonally, as shown in Figure 278b. Sometimes a heavy 
piece of wood is inserted between the other two corners, as in 
Figure 278c. This wooden bar prevents compression as well as 
gives solidity to the gate. 
293. Pendulum. The pendulum, as used in clocks to control 
    ce

-P-A-G-E-310
MECHANICS 301 
the movement of the clock works, is familiar to us all. In this 
we have a weight or bob at the lower end of a slender rod. 
The center of gravity is much below the base. When the bob is 
pulled aside the center of gravity is raised, 
so that when the bob is released it falls back 
to its lowest position. It does not, how- 
ever, stop there, but, because of inertia, 
passes on, rising on the other side. As a 
result a to and fro motion takes place. 
This vibrating motion will gradually be- 
come less, and finally come to an end 
because of friction at the support and the 
resistance of the air as the pendulum moves 
through it. If, however, this frictional re- 
tarding effect is overcome by 
the force of the escapement 
wheel (Fig. 279), the pendu- 
lum continues to vibrate as

often in mantel clocks, there are in the bob two tubes (Fig. 280) 
which contain mercury. As the center of gravity is lowered 
by the expanding rod, the expansion of the mercury upwards 
counteracts the effect. The pendulum thus remains the same 
length at all temperatures.

294. Pressure in Liquids. In houses where the water sup- 
plied to the boiler comes from a tank upstairs, the hot water 
comes from the faucet in the kitchen with much more force 
than from the faucets upstairs. This is evidence that the higher 
the column of water 
extends above the

is the pressure at

  serted in the holes (Fig. 282), the water level will be the same 
in the bottle and in the 
three tubes. (Note—As a 
matter of fact, it will be 
slightly higher in the tubes 
because of capillarity, 
which will be discussed 
later.) If there is an open- 
ing in one of the tubes 
anywhere below the level 
shown, water will run out 
of that tube until its level 
in the bottle and in the 
other tubes has reached
-P-A-G-E-313
304 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
that of the opening. The saying, “Water seeks its level,” is 
well illustrated by Figure 283. In the teapot (Fig. 284) and 
the watering pot we can tell while pour- 
ing how much water is left in each with- 
out looking inside. 
If into a tube one centimeter on a 
side (one centimeter square) (Fig. 285), 
water is poured to a depth of one centi- 
meter, there will be a pressure of one 
gram on the bottom, which has an area of one square centi- 
meter, If the column of water is 2 centimeters high, the 
pressure becomes 2 grams per square centimeter. For each | 
additional centimeter in the height of the 
column, there is one gram pressure added to 
the square centimeter on the bottom. 
Tf we now take a tube one centimeter by 
2 centimeters on its base, there will be a pres- 
sure of 2 grams on 2 square centimeters when 
water is poured in to a depth of one centimeter. 
The pressure per square centimeter is the same 
as before, namely, one gram. For each addi- 
tional centimeter of height in the water column 
there will be an additional 2 grams pressure 
on 2 square centimeters of the base, or one 
gram on one square centimeter of the base. Fic. 285 
Thus an increase in the area of the base does 
not increase the pressure intensity. This is determined. only 
by the height of the water column. The total pressure upon 
the base is, however, affected by the area of the base. It is 
found by multiplying the pressure per square centimeter by 
the area in square centimeters. If the depth is in feet and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-314
MECHANICS 305 
area is in square feet, the pressure intensity is 62.4 pounds per 
square foot for every foot of depth below the surface. 
If a box 30 cm. long and 20 cm. wide is filled with water to 
a depth of 15 cm., the pressure intensity on the bottom is 15 g. 
per sq. cm. The total pressure is 15 multiplied by the area, 
which is 30 X 20. The total pressure is thus 15 X 30 X 20 = 
g,o00 g. If a box is 2 ft. long and 1.5 ft. wide, and is filled 
with water to a depth of 2 ft., the pressure intensity is 2 X 62.4 
== 124.8 Ibs. per sq. ft. The total pressure is 124.8 X 2 X 
1.5 == 374.4 lbs. 
295. Density. A jug filled with kerosene or alcohol weighs 
less, and when filled with molasses it weighs more than when 
filled with water. An iron ball weighs many times as much as 
a cork ball of the same size. Aluminum utensils are noticeable 
for theit lightness. We thus see that equal volumes of different 
substances weigh differently. The weight of any unit volume 
of a substance, such as a cubic foot or a cubic centimeter, is 
called the density of that particular substance. It is expressed 
in the English system in pounds per cubic foot and in the 
metric system in grams per cubic centimeter. It is found by 
dividing the weight of any given object by its volume. 
Following is a table of the densities of many common 
substances.

296. Pressure Intensity When Liquids Other Than 
Water Are Used. If a liquid one cubic centimeter of which 
weighs twice as much as water were used in a tube, the pres- 
sure would be twice as much as at the same depth in water. 
A liquid less dense than water would produce a less pressure 
intensity. Consequently in calculating the total pressure pro- 
duced by a liquid upon any horizontal surface, we must know 
the density of the liquid, the depth below the surface, and the 
area pressed upon. The total pressure is the product of these 
three. For example, at a depth of 5 meters in fresh water the 
total pressure on the top of an immersed box 2 meters long by 
one meter wide will be 500 X 200 & I00 = 10,000,000 g. In 
sea water, which has a density of 1.026 g. per c.c., the total 
pressure at the same depth on the same box top is 500 X 200 
X 100 X 1.026 = 10,260,000 g. .
-P-A-G-E-316
MECHANICS ~ 307 
In a tank of kerosene oil of density 8 g. per c.c., the total 
pressure on this box top at a depth of 5 meters is 500 X 200 
X 100 X .8 = 8,000,000 g. 
297. Meaning of Depth in a Liquid. In determining the 
depth it is the vertical, not the slant, distance from the surface 
exposed to the air, to the point under 
consideration, that must be taken. The A 
pressure at the bottom of tube 4 (Fig. i 
286) is just the same as at the bottom 8 
of B, though the length of column 4 is 
greater. 4 
298. Pressure at a Given Point in Fic. 286 
a Liquid Is the Same in All Directions, 
Assuming that the downward pressure 
at the point O in the liquid (Fig. 287) 
is 5 g. per sq. cm., then there is an equal 
upward and an equal sideways pres- 
sure towards the front, back, and sides. 
Were this not true and if the sidewdys 
pressure at X were greater than at O, 
there would be an unbalanced force, 
and motion would result. For the same 
Teason motion downwards would result if the upward pressure 
at O were less than the downward pressure there. Likewise 
there would be motion upwards if the upward pressure at O 
were greater than the downward pressure there.

of 5 X 16= 80g. The sideways pressure on the front will equal 
that on the back, and the pressures on the sides will balance. 
We thus see that there is an excess pressure of 80 — 16 = 64¢.

| sure, is greater than this, the cube will sink; if it is less, the cube 
\ will be pushed up and float; if it is the same, the cube will re- 
main where it is, when released from its suspended condition. 
Which of these three things will happen is determined by the 
material of which the cube is made. The volume of the cube is 
64 c.c., exactly equal to the volume of water it displaces, The 
buoyant effect is 64 g., exactly equal to the weight of water 
displaced. If the density of the material is less than one gram 
Per c.c., the total weight will be less than 64 g. and the cube 
will rise. If its density is one gram per c.c., it will remain sus- 
pended ; if more than one gram per c.c., it will sink. 
The quantitative relation between the weight of water dis- 
placed by an object and the buoyant effect produced upon it by 
the water may be shown by the following experiment: 
Fill the overflow can 4 (Fig. 289) with water, allowing the water to run out until it reaches the level of the outlet O. Next weigh the catch bucket B empty. Take any object such as a piece of marble, that 
      
sinks in water, and weigh it in air by counterbalancing. Next carefully 
lower this into the water of the overflow can. The water will be dis- 
Placed, and the amount pushed up will be equal to the volume of the 
marble. This water will overflow into the catch bucket. Weigh the 
Marble in the water, thus finding its apparent weight in the water. |

Weigh the catch bucket with the displaced water, that has overflowed. 
If we subtract the apparent weight of the marble in water from its 
weight in air, and the weight of the catch bucket empty from its weight 
with the overflow water, we find the two results are equal. From this 
we deduce Archimedes’ principle, which is that the loss in apparent 
weight of an object immersed in a liquid is equal to the weight of liquid 
displaced. 
Whether a substance sinks or floats when immersed in a 
liquid depends upon whether or not its weight is greater or less 
than an equal volume of the liquid, i.¢., whether or-not it is 
denser or less dense than the liquid. A substance such as ice 
will float in water but will sink in alcohol, because it is denser 
than alcohol and less dense than water. If mercury, olive oil, 
and colored water are mixed and allowed to stand, they will 
separate into layers, with the mercury on the bottom and the 
oil on top. 
Sometimes objects float even when made of materials denser 
than the liquid. Ships float even though made of steel; a tin 
cracker box, if placed carefully upon the water, so as to allow 
no water to get inside, floats. The explanation of this is that 
while the cracker box is floating upon the water, and therefore 
apparently weighs nothing, the space 
that was occupied by the displaced 
water is now occupied, not by the 
cracker box alone, but by cracker 
box and air within it (Fig. 290). 
Fic. 290 Now the weight of the whole cracker 
box and of the air included in the 
space a b ¢ d is just equal to that of the displaced water that 
occupied the space e f g h. If water is poured inside the box, 
the latter will settle lower into the water until the weight of the 
tin box + the water inside is greater than that of the displaced

water, when the box will sink. This is why metal rowboats or 
metal ships sink when they are “swamped,” while wooden boats 
do not. It explains why a motor boat, with its heavy engine, 
sinks when filled with water, even though its framework is made 
of wood. , 
Pumice is full of very small pores. The air in these is not 
readily forced out when the piece of pumice is placed in water. 
Pumice full of air thus floats , 
upon water, though its sub- 
stance is denser than water. 
Certain soaps float upon water 
because of a large amount of 
) air in them. 
In the ball cock that regu- 
lates the supply of water in 
house tanks, the float is a hollow metal ball (Fig. 291). As the 
water level rises the buoyant force pushes the ball up, thus 
stopping the flow of water by shutting the valve.

MECHANICS OF GASES 
300. Gases Have Weight. Gases have weight, just as do 
liquids. This may be easily shown by weighing the brass globe 
(Fig. 292), which is at first filled with air. If it is again 
weighed after pumping out the air, there 
will be a difference in weight equal to the 
weight of the air removed. 
301. Atmosphere. Just as sea animals 
crawl about on the bottom of an ocean of 
water, so do human beings and 
animals move about at the bottom 
of an ocean of air called the 
atmosphere. This atmosphere 
forms a blanket of air about the 
Fic. 292 earth, extending upwards to a 
height of about fifty miles. Peo- 
ple have been led to believe this because balloonists 
find that the air becomes less and less dense (rarer 
or thinner) as they go higher, and from this the prob- 
able height of the atmosphere is calculated. Beyond 
the limit of the atmosphere there is nothing but the 
ether. 
302. Pressure of the Atmosphere. The atmos- 
phere above the earth exerts a downward pressure, 
just as do liquids. How great the pressure is depends, Fic. 293
-P-A-G-E-322
MECHANICS 313 
of course, upon the depth of the air column. If a U-tube (Fig. 
293) has mercury in the two arms, its upper level will be at the 
same height in both, as there must be the same pressure exerted 
at the bottom of each side to produce equilibrium. The atmos- 
phere in this case pushes down equally on each side. Suppose, 
however, that one side is sealed at the top and the closed arm 
is filled with mercury and then inverted (Fig. 294). If the 
closed arm is over thirty inches long the mercury 
will not come to rest at the same level in both 
arms, as in Figure 293, but will drop only 
slightly, leaving a space V in which there is no 
air or mercury. - Such a condition, in which a 
space contains neither solid, liquid, nor gas, we 
have learned is a vacuum. The mercury does 
not fall further because something is holding 
it up. Inasmuch as there is equilibrium, the 
pressure at the bottom of the two arms must be 
equal. On the left side there is a pressure pro- 
duced by the long column of mercury 4; on the 
tight there is a pressure produced by the short 
column of mercury B and the atmosphere. The 
atmosphere does not act upon the left side. If 
the top of this side were opened, the air would 
immediately get in and acting downwards upon 
the top of the mercury column, force it down until the level 
is the same in both arms. In Figure 294 the atmosphere is 
exerting a pressure equal to the column D, since B is balanc- 
ing C. We thus say that the atmosphere exerts a pressure 
equal to that of a column of mercury about 30 inches in height. 
The pressure exerted by the atmosphere is thus equal to about 
15 pounds to the square inch, or 1,033 grams per sq. cm. Con-      a 
Fic. 294
-P-A-G-E-323
314 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
sidering the size of a square inch it is easy to see that the pres 
sure of the atmosphere upon our bodies and upon objects about | 
us is enormous. 
303. Barometers. An apparatus used for the measurement 
of atmospheric pressure is called a barometer. There are two 
kinds of barometers, mercurial (Fig. 295) and aneroid. The 
latter type will be explained later. In either one, the reading 
that records the atmospheric pressure is given as 
so many inches or centimeters. The barometric 
reading is not the same at all times, as the pressure 
is different from day to day. Cooks say that water 
does not “come to a boil” so quickly on some days 
as on others. This is because on a day when the 
atmospheric pressure is greater than normal, the 
boiling point of water is higher, as there is a greater 
pressure of air to be pushed aside by the steam 
(see Section 49). 
304. Atmospheric Pressure as a Weather 
Indicator. It is a well-known fact that when water 
boils away in a kettle more rapidly than usual, it is 
an indication of stormy weather. The sea captain 
Fic. 295 foretells a storm by a rapid fall in the barometer 
MercvriaL readings. Both of these means of predicting a BAROMETER . 
coming storm are due to the same cause, a reduced 
atmospheric pressure. 
Wind is air in motion, resulting from a difference in the 
pressure of the atmosphere in two different places. The air 
always moves from the place of higher to that of lower pres- 
sure. Rain clouds are blown along by the wind. They are thus 
brought to those regions where the atmospheric pressure has 
been reduced in some way. A considerable “fall” in the barom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
MECHANICS 315 
eter shows to the sea captain a pressure lower than normal, and 
warns him of the coming storm. A pressure lower than normal 
makes water boil at a lower temperature and therefore it boils 
away faster. 
A rapid “rise” in the barometer indicates an increased 
atmospheric pressure, which results in storm clouds moving 
away. Thus fair weather is predicted when the barometer rises. 
305. Relation between the Volume of a Gas and Its 
Pressure. When we ride on a bicycle or in an automobile we 
feel the jolts less because the tires are filled with air. This air 
is not in the samie condition as ordinary atmospheric air, but 
has been forced in until it is at considerable pressure. It has 
been compressed. The tire, before the air was pumped in, 
was full of air; it remains full of air as we pump more in. The 
difference is that it contains the same volume of air but at a 
different pressure; and it is this increased pressure that keeps 
| the tires from flattening out. Large volumes of outside air at 
ordinary pressure have been forced to occupy a smal! volume 
at greatly increased pressure. The volume of this air decreases 
, at the same rate that its pressure increases. This law applies to 
all gases the temperature of which remains the same. It was 
discovered by Robert Boyle, and is called Boyle’s Law of Gases. 
If the pressure upon a gas is made equal to two atmospheres it 
will occupy one-half the space that it occupied at ordinary 
atmospheric pressure. Likewise if we compress a gas to one- 
third of its original volume, it will exert three times as much 
pressure outward. 
306. Aneroid Barometer. In the aneroid barometer 
| (Fig. 296), which is the more common form seen, the changes 
in atmospheric pressure make the walls of the hollow corrugated 
| metal box (Fig. 296b) separate or come closer together. The
-P-A-G-E-325
310 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
box is air-tight and the air inside is ina rarefied condition. This 
air will increase in volume as the pressure outside decreases, and 
will push the thin walls of the box apart. One side of this box 
At High Atmospheric Pressure

b 
Fic. 296.—ANEROID BAROMETER 
is fastened securely to the base of the instrument. The other 
side is connected to a pointer through a system of levers. As 
the free side of the box moves up and down with the changes 
in volume of the air inside, the pointer moves back and forth 
over a scale on which is graduated the 
inches or centimeters by which the pressure 
is indicated. Sometimes the pointer is an 
inked pen that records upon paper wound 
around a revolving drum a curve which 
represents the fluctuations of pressure 
for a week. This is called a recording 
barometer.

In the sprayer (Fig. 302), a small stream of air is forced 
over the end of a tube, the other end of which rests in the liquid 
to be sprayed. The reduced pressure at the open end of the

giz. During our study we have had occasion to refer to 
two kinds of pumps, in both cases dealing with air. In Sec 
tion 49, Figure 19, reference was made to an air exhaust pump 
as used to make water boil at reduced pressure. In Section 296 , 
a pump was mentioned as used to force air into a bicycle tire. | 
312. Air Pump. Pumps are contrivances used to transfer 
fluids (liquids or gases) from one place to another. They con- 
sist of some movable part and a confined space of some sort 
for the fluid to occupy temporarily. 
If the piston (Fig. 3052) is raised, the air below it expands. 
Its pressure becomes less, and as a result the atmosphere pushes 
upon the two valves 
o and 7 harder that. 
the air inside pushes 
outwards. Each 
valve opens only 
one way,o outwards 
and i inwards. The 
greater atmospheric 
pressure acting 
b upon o shuts it, 
while on the other 
side iis forced open and air rushes in until the inside and outside 
air pressures are equal. 
On the down stroke of the piston the reverse process takes 
place. The air is compressed and pushes outwards harder than 
the atmosphere pushes inwards. Valve i is forced shut and 
valve o is opened, the air passing out until the pressures inside 
and outside are equal.   
  
  a 
Fic. 305.—~AIR PUMP
-P-A-G-E-332
MECHANICS 323 
We thus have a transfer of air from the right to the left 
of the cylinder as a result of the up and down stroke of the 
piston. If we connect the side L to the rubber bladder of a 
basket ball or football, air will be forced into it under pressure, 
and the basket ball becomes harder.’ In this way the pump 
becomes a compression air pump, forcing air into the basket 
ball on the dow stroke. 
If, on the other hand, we connect the side R to a bottle, the 
air in the bottle will expand and pass into the cylinder below 
the piston on the up stroke, because, as the piston moves up- 
wards, the air below it expands and exerts a less pressure upon 
i than does the air in the bottle. This will take place on the 
up stroke of the piston. On the down stroke the air below the 
piston is forced out through 0 and L. On each up stroke the air 
.t the bottle tends to expand into the cylinder of the pump, 
just as long as there is a sufficient difference in pressure to force 
open the valve i. In this case, in which air is being removed, 
the pump becomes an erhaust pump. 
Frequently the outlet is on the other side of the piston from 
the inlet, and there is a valve in the piston to allow the air to 
pass through it on the down stroke and be forced out on the 
up stroke (Fig. 3055). 
The various vacuum cleaners in use nowadays are exhaust 
pumps of either the to and fro piston, or of the rotary type. 
In the latter form there is a fan (Fig. 306) which, as it rotates, 
forms a partial vacuum at a. This is because of the centrifugal 
[tendency of the air between the sides of the wheel. If the open- 
ings a and b are covered, and a is connected to the floor by a 
pipe, while b is connected to a bag of closely woven cloth, the 
air, as it is forced into a by the greater outside pressure, will 
carry dust along with it. This dust is then collected by the bag

314. Human Lungs. In the lungs we have a bellows in 
which the inlet and outlet for the air are the same. The lungs 
are made up of two connected sacs inclosed within the chest 
cavity. Between the outer walls of the sacs and the inner walls 
of the chest cavity there is a thin layer of lubricating liquid. 
The atmospheric pressure keeps the sacs inflated so that they 
fill the cavity. By means of the muscles between the ribs and 
by the diaphragm it is possible to increase the size of the chest 
cavity. (Note.—The diaphragm separates the chest cavity from 
the abdomen.) During this act of inspiration the air inside, 
upon expanding, becomes reduced in pressure and the greater 
atmospheric pressure outside forces air in, On expiration, the 
muscles are relaxed, whereupon the chest contracts naturally 
and the air pressure inside be- 
comes greater than the atmos- 
pheric pressure outside. The air 
is forced out by the diaphragm 
and by the muscles of the chest. 
The greater effort is in the act of 
inspiration, for it is in this that 
the chest muscles are stretched. 
Figure 308 represents the action 
of the diaphragm. A toy balloon 
is fastened to a glass tube, and 
the tube is passed through a one- 
holed stopper that fits the top of 
the bell jar. Over the lower

downwards the balloon becomes inflated. If the disc is pushed 
inwards the balloon collapses. (Note——After the rubber disc 
has been fastened over the lower end of the bell jar, the balloon 
should be blown up slightly before the stopper is inserted.) 
315. Pneumatic Piano Player. In this apparatus we find 
application of an exhaust pump in the form of a bellows 
operated by foot power. The piaro 
mechanism is the same as in any reg- 
ular piano. There is an additional 
mechanism (Fig. 309) by means of 
which the hammers of the piano can 
be made to strike the wires through | 
atmospheric pressure instead of by the 
pressure of the hand. Which hammers 
shall strike is determined by perforated 
paper rolls which pass across a tracker 
bar consisting of a series of openings, 
each one of which corresponds to a 
note on the piano. The foot bellows 
produces a partial vacuum in each of 
1 these openings as long as they are 
Fic. 309.—Prano Prayer covered by the paper. When a per- MECHANISM . . 
foration in the paper passes over the 
opening, air passes through it into the tube, as indicated by 
the arrows. This air presses against the three pistons at the left 
of the three bellows above the piano key, and moves the pistons 
to the right, thereby allowing the air in the three bellows to be 
pumped out by the exhaust pump (foot bellows) below. The 
greater atmospheric pressure on the outside of these three 
bellows makes them collapse. As they do so, they push up the 
rod which actuates the hammer mechanism, just as does the

forated sheets are turned by an air motor that is operated by 
the same exhaust beilows that operates the hammers. 
316. Bicycle Pump. In the bicycle pump (Fig. 310) there 
is no valve in the piston nor at the outlet. There is a valve in 
the tire, however. The 
leather rim of the piston is 
cup-shaped, curving down- 
wards. On the up stroke 
the edges curve inwards 
and air passes around the 
rim; on the down stroke 
the leather opens outwards, 
presses firmly against the 
wall of the cylinder, and 
thus prevents the passage of the air around the piston. The 
action may be likened to the effect produced upon an umbrella 
when it is pushed back and forth, while being held by the end 
azway from the handle. It opens out and shuts according as we 
push it away or draw it towards us. 
317. “Suction.” What makes water rise 
in a pump? Our commonly accepted idea of 
water is that it flows down hill, not up. This is 
because it is denser than the air and therefore 
sinks beneath the air. When we put a straw 
into soda water and “suck” on it, the soda 
“rises” into the mouth. We have learned that 
whenever there is motion, an unbalanced force 
is the cause. Is the air pulling the soda after it, 
or is something pushing it from behind? More 
reasonabiy the latter is the case, for there must

be something under the water to push it up. What really hap-

its lower end in water has a tight-fitting piston in it (see a), the 
air inside the piston pushes down upon the water inside just as 
hard as the atmosphere pushes on the water outside, since the 
water levels are the same. If, however, the piston is raised, the 
air inside will expand and exert a less pressure. Some water 
will be pushed up the tube (see b) by the unbalanced outside 
pressure. The water will rise until the combined pressure of | 
the expanded air and the water inside equals this atmospheric 
pressure, If the piston is now pushed down again, the air will 
be compressed and will exert an increased downward pressure 
sufficient to equal the atmospheric pressure without the aid of the 
water cclumn inside. The water thus drops back to its original 
position; or even lower if the piston is pushed down so far as 
to increase the inside air pressure above that of the atmosphere 
‘outside. We thus see that it is the pressure of 
the atmosphere that forces water up the tube when 
the piston is raised. 
"Suppose the piston has a valve in it (Fig. 312) 
that will open upwards only. When the piston is 
raised this valve will remain shut ; as the pressure 
of the atmosphere downwards on the top of it is 
greater than that of the air upwards inside. If 
the piston is now pushed down suddenly, the 
compression of the air below it will take place so 
quickly that the valve will be forced upward and 
the air will escape through it into the atmosphere 
above. There will now be less air in the cylinder than originally. 
On the next up stroke the water will rise higher inside, as there 
will be less air inside to press down with the water. A repetition

valve in the piston. To prevent this a second valve 
should be placed in the tube just below the piston at 
the bottom of the stroke (Fig. 313@). This valve 
opens upwards as does that in the piston. It shuts 
when the water starts back on the down stroke, so 
that the water must pass through the piston. Such 
an arrangement gives us what is called a lifting ot 
Suction pump. 
318. Limit to the Height Water Can Be ~ 
Raised by a “Suction” or Lifting Pump. Since 
the atmosphere can force mercury up 30 inches, as 
in the barometer, it can force water 30 X 13.6 times 
as high, or 408 inches, which is equal to 34 feet.’ 
Thus it can readily be seen that since the water 
is continually being forced up to the valve of the 
piston by the atmosphere, the piston at the lower 
end of the stroke must not be higher than 32 feet 
above the water in a well, if we are to get it out 
at the top. For this reason, in very deep 
wells the piston rod has to be quite long 
(Fig. 3130). 
319. Priming a Pump. Sometimes the 
sides of the piston, which are generally of 
leather, become dry from lack of use, so that 
the piston does not touch the walls of the tube all around 
(Fig. 314). In this case air leaks around the piston as it is 
raised and lowered. Water must be poured in at the top so 
as to fill this space while the piston is being moved. The 
action must of course be quick or the water will soon run 
down around the piston. Such a process of starting a dried 
out pump is called “priming.” After the leather becomes 
wet, it swells and the piston fits tightly. 
  1 Since water turns readily to a vapor, so that we cannot get so near a vacuum over it, as wit? 
mercury, this height is really less, about 32 feet.

320. Simple Force Pump. If the piston of Figure 313 were 
solid, and a valve opened outward near the bottom (Fig. 315), 
we should have a force pump, in which water would come out 
  Fic. 315—Simp_e Force Pump Fic. 316.—TR ge Sprayinc Pump 
of the pump, not on the up stroke, but on the dozen stroke. Such 
a pump is used for spraying trees (Fig. 316). 
321. The Heart a Force Pump. The heart beat, and its 
accompanying pulse in the arteries, is produced by the mast 
perfect and efficient pump known. The heart is a muscular 
organ divided vertically into two independent halves, each of 
which is a force pump. In each half is an auricle and a ventricle. 
For our purpose the auricle need not be considered, save as it 
aids the action of the ventricle, the true pump. A simple force 
Pump as above described requires an inlet and an outlet, each 
fitted with a one-way valve, and a solid piston as a means of
-P-A-G-E-341
332 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
transferring the liquid from inlet to outlet. There is no piston 
in the heart (Fig. 317), but instead of this there is an expan- 
sion and contraction of the walls of the ventricle which make 
the cavity alternately large and small. On expansion, blood 
rushes in from the auricle into the ventricle through the auriculo- 
ventricular valve. The valve into the artery is shut. When the 
  Fic. 317-—Hrarr ActTIoN 
ventricular walls contract, the auriculo-ventricular valve is 
forced shut and blood is forced into the artery. The alternate 
expansion and contraction of the ventricle produce the heart 
beat ; while the intermittent pumping of blood into the artery 
produces the pulse. 
322. Siphon. Many people are often bothered by having 
the drip pan of the refrigerator overflow. It is practically im- 
possible to remove the pan from under the refrigerator and 
empty it into the sink, without spilling considerable of the 
water. A simple little device in the form of a short rubber tube,
-P-A-G-E-342
MECHANICS 333 
about a foot long, properly used, will do away with all this 
unnecessary spilling. Fill this tube with water, hold the ends _ 
tightly to prevent the escape of the water, and release one end 
under the surface of the water in the pan, allowing the other 
end to rest on the bottom of a dipper on the floor alongside. 
Water will flow from the pan to the dipper until.the level in the 
dipper is the same as that in the pan. One or two emptyings 
of the dipper will bring the water level in the pan to a safe point 
for removing the whole pan to the sink 
and emptying it. In this simple rubber 
tube so used, we have a siphon, the 
action of which may be explained by 
Figure 318. Whenever forces are un- 
balanced, motion results. In this case 
the atmosphere acts equally downwards 
at s and upwards at o. The water 
inside the tube below i balances an 
equal column in the jar of water; the 
column i¢ balances ¢ t; the column fo is unbalanced, and pulls 
downwards and out. Just as long as the outlet o is below 
the level of the water in the jar there will be this unbalanced 
column, and action results. This action is greater the farther 
the opening o is below the inside level. It must be noted that the 
atmosphere keeps forcing more water up the arm i ¢ as it goes 
out the arm e 9, We may thus say that a siphon is a contrivance 
which utilizes atmospheric pressure to allow us to transfer water 
from a higher to a lower level, first making it go over an 
elevation. 
323. Adhesion and Cohesion. When we desire to stick 
together two substances that do not of themselves adhere, we 
must place between them something that sticks or adheres to 
  "Fis. 318.—SIPHON
-P-A-G-E-343
334 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
each. Such a substance is called an adhesive, as glue, mucilage, 
cement, Which one we use depends upon the substances to be 
treated. For inorganic substances like crockery, glass, stone, 
we use mineral cement; for organic substances like paper or 
wood, we use glue or mucilage of organic origin. The reason 
for this is that the cement must have nearly the same expansion 
rate as the objects cemented. Otherwise a change in tempera- 
ture will cause a sliding of one object over the cement. It is on 
this account that it is difficult to cement inorganic materials like 
metal or porcelain to organic substances like pasteboard. 
The force of attraction between the adhesive and the thing 
stuck is called adhesion, as contrasted with the force that holds 
different parts of the same substance together, called cohesion. 
Cohesion is exemplified in the opposition that wood offers to 
being broken or torn apart; that metals offer to being broken; 
that pieces of cement or glue themselves offer to being frac- 
tured. In the case of glue on wood, experience has shown that 
a thin layer well pressed between the two pieces holds them 
together much better than a thick layer does. This shows that 
the adhesive force between wood and glue is greater than the 
cohesive force in the glue itself. The force of cohesion differs 
in substances, just as does that of adhesion between different 
substances. Whether any part of a substance clings to another 
when the two are brought together depends upon which force 
is greater. Thus water clings to the skin and feels wet when 
the finger is immersed. The finger is wet when removed. In 
the case of mercury, however, though the finger feels wet when 
immersed, it is dry when removed. Liquids between which the 
adhesive force is great mix very readily ; as in the case of alcohol 
and water. In the case of oil and water, the oil will not mix 
and floats upon the surface of the water. Water does not adhere
-P-A-G-E-344

to oily substances, hence the difficulty in washing oily hands; 
or in trying to dry hands with unbleached cloth, in which there 
is considerable gummy substance.

| 324. Capillarity. A rough porous paper absorbs ink well 
and is therefore used for blotting paper. In paper which we 
use for writing purposes, the pores have been filled up with 
some substance, called a filler, that prevents the spreading of 
the ink. A lump of sugar with only one corner dipped in a cup 
of coffee or tea quickly turns brown all through, showing that
-P-A-G-E-345
336 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
the liquid has risen through it. A towel when rubbed on the 
wet hands becomes wet through. A lamp wick with one end 
in the oil soon becomes saturated throughout. In all of these 
instances, the adhesive force has a chance to act over a very 
large surface. Spreading outwards and upwards, such an action 
in small openings as are present in porous bodies is called 
capillarity. We see it all about us in the swelling of wood and 
string in damp weather, in spots spreading on the ceiling 
when the roof leaks, The great porosity of wool makes it 
absorb large quantities of water, which require a long time 
to evaporate. 
To prevent capillary action we put a filler in wood and coat 
it with varnish. This counteracts the tendency of the wood to 
absorb moisture and warp as a consequence. 
Cloth, both woolen and cotton, each of which is easily wet, 
is frequently made waterproof by putting something into it to 
prevent capillary action. 
In rubber we have a material which in itself is not porous 
nor does water adhere to it. It therefore makes the best water- 
proof material.

Need of Pure Water. Next to an ample provision of 
uncontaminated air for breathing, nothing is so essential to 
human life as a supply of pure, wholesome water. This ought 
to be so abundant that it can be used very freely. Together 
with this plentiful supply of water, there should be a good 
plumbing system in a house. 
In the country, where houses are scattered, the removal of 
waste from the house is not a difficult matter, so long as care 
340
-P-A-G-E-350
PLUMBING 341 
is exercised in keeping the waste matter away from the source of water. During drought the water supply, however, is some- times the cause of considerable worry. 
With the rapid growth of cities and the resultant concen- tration of families, the problem of a pure water supply and a Proper sewerage system has been constantly growing. In the cities, where houses are close together, unless the sewerage system is under one general control, there is great danger of contamination of the water, as well as of the air supply. In order to avoid this contamination, certain regulations are made concerning the removal of waste in city houses, 
| WATER SUPPLY 
325. Ground Water. In the country, the water supply comes from wells or springs, the quantity depending upon the Tainfall. 
The crust of the earth is 
made up of layers of different 
Composition, which have been 
deposited in ages past, one 
upon another. Some of these 
layers, such as sand or gravel, 
are porous, and allow water to 
sink readily through them. 
Other layers, such as clay or 
Tock, are not porous, and water 
‘annot penetrate them. When 
‘ain falls upon the surface of the 
‘arth, the water soaks into the 
Porous layers, and sinks until it : . | Teaches one of these impervious Fi. 319-—Grounn “‘Warer :  
-P-A-G-E-351
342 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
layers, If this layer is horizontal, the water collects over it to 
a varying depth, according to the amount of rainfall (Fig. 319). 
This water is called ground water. 
In a flat country it will be of the same depth over a large 
area. In case the layers of earth are uneven (Fig. 320), there 
may be a layer b that is porous and exposed in some place on 
a mountain side. If ¢ and d are not porous, water will flow 
between them and collect until it rises to the level ¢ in the layer 4, 
Exposed ce 
    provided there is no outlet through d or c. In case the thick- 
ness of d is very slight at some point, say at a, the pressure of 
the water in b, the level of which is much above a, may be sufhi- 
cient to force an opening through d to the surface, and a spring 
results, 
In case the layer d is too thick for the water to work its way 
through, an artificial opening may be forced through d, and an 
artesian well results. Water will be pushed out through the 
opening by the pressure produced because of the higher level 
ofe. This is a true artesian well. The term, however, has come 
to be applied to any well that has been bored through a non- 
porous layer to a porous one containing water. The water in 
all cases is supplied by the rainfall that has collected in the 
porous layer.
-P-A-G-E-352
PLUMBING 343 
If ground water on a level place is to serve as a water supply, 
it must be tapped by means of a well. This may be an open or 
a driven weil. 
326. Open Well. An open well consists of a hole dug in the 
ground to a point that is below the upper level of the ground 
water (Fig. 321). Water tends to pass by capillary action to 
  
  Fic. 321.—OPEN WELL Fic. 322——Driven WELL 
any place exposed to the atmosphere, if the soil is loose. For 
this reason water from all sides flows into a well, in which the 
level of the water is the same as that of the surrounding ground 
water. Water is raised from such a well either by buckets or 
by means of a lifting or force pump. 
327. Driven Well. In this type of well (Fig. 322) an iron 
tube made in sections, with a point on the lowest one, is driven 
through the earth until it reaches ground water. The first sec- 
tion of the tube, which has the point on it, is perforated with
-P-A-G-E-353
344 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
many holes, so that the water can pass into it and thus be pumped 
to the surface. 
Fic. 328. Wind Mill Pumps. Whenever water is pumped by 
means of hand pumps, the supply in the house is greatly limited. 
  Winp MILL 
Pump 
  Sometimes the energy of the wind is 
utilized to run a wind mill pump, by which 
water is forced to a tank considerably 
higher than the highest faucet of a house 
(Fig. 323). This furnishes a supply that 
can be piped to the house. In this case 
the pressure of the water at a high level 
furnishes continuous water at the outlets. 
329. Compression Tank Water Sup- 
ply. The wind mill pump and tank are 
today being largely supplanted by a force 
pump that is driven by a gasoline engine 
or an electric motor. By means of this 
pump, water is forced into a compression 
tank in the cellar of country houses. This 
system is superior to the other one in that 
it is not dependent upon the wind, and the tank, being in the 
cellar, is not subjected to the heat of the sun. 
In such a system, water is forced into the bottom of a large 
cylindrical tank (Fig. 324). 
the air is compressed, thereby As the water level rises inside, 
exerting an increasing pres- : sure downwards upon the 
surface of the water. When 
a faucet in the house above 
is opened, the water is forced 
through the outlet into the

PLUMBING 345 
supply pipe, which supplies water to the various fixtures and 
tanks of the house, just as does the supply pipe from the street 
mains in city houses. As water is drawn off the pressure de- 
creases, and this must be watched and the engine set running, 
in order to pump a fresh supply as needed. For this kind of 
pump four-cycle gasoline engines are generally used. 
330. Gasoline Engine. Most of us are familiar with the 
gasoline engine as a motive power in automobiles and motor 
boats. Some are also familiar with its use in the country now- 
adays, to replace the windmill as a means of driving water 
pumps, circular saws, and other farm machinery. 
This form of engine is run by the energy of combustion of 
gasoline vapor, which, when mixed with air in the right pro- 
portion, explodes with great violence. This explosion occurs 
in an inclosed cylinder in which there is a piston connected 
with a shaft, and is brought about by an electric spark which 
forms at a time when the mixture of gasoline vapor and air is 
under compression. The piston is forced to the other end of the 
cylinder and the shaft rotates as a result. 
There are two types of gasoline engines, called the two-cycle 
and the four-cycle. The difference in them is in the frequency 
with which the explosion takes place. Calling the stroke of the 
piston from one end of the cylinder to the other end a cycle, in 
the two-cycle type, an explosion takes place every revolution 
of the shaft, or two cycles. In the four-cycle type (Fig. 325) 
the explosion occurs every two revolutions, or four cycles. 
The two-cycle engine is used almost exclusively on motor 
boats. The four-cycle engine has more extended use for other 
Purposes. 
331. Four-Cycle Engine. In this form, when the piston is 
| made to move down by the crank, an explosive mixture enters ~
-P-A-G-E-355
On the return stroke this mixture is compressed, and when the 
piston is at the top of its stroke, explosion is brought about 
fatare Compression Explosion Exhaust by an electric spark. The 
force of the expanding 
gases drives the piston 
down, and the inertia of the 
heavy fly wheel fastened on 
the shaft causes the piston 
not only to move back and 
thereby force out the waste 
gases through the valve at 
the left, but to continue 
Fic. 325—Action In A Four- through another intake 
CycuE Gasoline ENGIny stroke and compression 
stroke. Thus one explosion brings about four strokes of the 
piston. The valves open inwards and are operated by cams 
which are connected with the shaft of the engine. 
On automobiles, several four-cycle engines are connected 
on one shaft, and so adjusted that the explosions take place 
in succession. If there are two cylinders, explosions occur 
every revolution of the shaft; with four cylinders, every half 
revolution. With six cylinders, there are three explosions to a 
revolution. 
332. City Water Supply. In planning for a city water 
supply, large bodies of water are sought, as ordinary wells 
would not furnish water in sufficient quantity. If possible the 
source should be high above the city, so that if pipes are run 
from it the pressure will be sufficient to force the water out of 
faucets on the top floor of houses. Often such high lakes are 
not available ; in such a case, where water from a lower source 346 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS

-P-A-G-E-356
PLUMBING 347 
must be used, a pumping station is necessary. Pumps force the 
water into reservoirs on some high land. From these reservoirs 
the water passes into the city mains, from which it enters houses 
through branch pipes. 
Where an extra pressure is desired to drive the water into 
houses on hills, the pumps drive water directly into the mains. 
In order to keep this pressure steady and to prevent too great 
@ pressure in the pipes at times when little water is being used, 
  
  Fie, 326.—WatTER Suppty STANDPIPES 
standpipes are erected at different elevated places (Fig. 326). 
Into these the extra water passes, to be drawn off at times when 
the demand exceeds the amount that is being pumped through 
the mains. In this way the pumps can be run at a more uniform 
rate during the times of both small and large consumption of 
water, The pressure of the water in the pipes will of course 
be determined by the height of the water in the standpipes, 
in all of which the level will be the same.

DISTRIBUTION OF WATER IN A HOUSE 
333. Where there is not a continuous water supply froma 
tank in a country house, the question of distribution need not 
be considered, as the water in this case is obtained as needed 
either by a bucket or by a pump. 
Where there is a continuous water supply piped to a house, 
it is divided into a cold water and a hot water system. 
334. Cold Water Supply. The cold water supply is led by 
branch pipes from the main supply pipe to the various cold 
water outlets and to the closet tanks. In cases where the cold 
water pipes are of the same size throughout the house, the 
turning on of one faucet is likely to diminish the flow through 
other faucets. To prevent this the main supply pipe should be 
larger than the branches. 
335. Hot Water Supply. The hot water supply is provided 
by heating cold water in a kitchen range or in a gas water 
heater. The cold water may come to these either directly from 
the cold water main, or indirectly through a supply tank, located 
high up in the house. 
336. Indirect Hot Water Supply System. The tank ina? 
indirect systeni is supplied with water from the cold wate 
main through a valve called a ball cock, operated by a ball floct

(Fig. 327). As the float rises with the rising water level, the 
supply of water is gradually shut off (see also Fig. 330). If 
the water level falls, the float drops with it, and the valve opens, 
allowing more cold water rteot Bell Cock 
to enter the tank. From the 
bottom of the tank a pipe 
passes to the kitchen boiler, 
through the top of which it 
extends nearly to the bottom 
inside (see Fig. 37). From 
the tank there is also an 
overflow pipe to carry off 
the excess of water in case — Fic, 327.——Hovuse SurPLy TANK,

    sxponSeen Pipe 
of this overflow pipe should be over a closet tank or a sink, such 
as that in the kitchen. 
337. Coal Range Water Heater. Where the water is heated 
by a coal range, a pipe passes from the bottom of the boiler 
to the lower part of the water back in the range (see Fig. 37). 
The upper part of the water back is connected to the side of the 
boiler about a third way up. Convection currents form as indi- 
cated, and the hot water collects in the top part of the boiler. 
From here it is forced out through the hot water supply pipes 
when any hot water faucet is opened. 
338. Gas Water Heater. In case a gas heater is used for 
heating the water, the bottom of the boiler is connected to the 
lower end of the heater coil, while the pipe from the top of 
the coil is connected to the hot water outlet pipe at the top of the 
boiler (Fig. 328). The reason for the difference in the manner 
j of connecting this last pipe is that when the gas heater is used, 
4%
-P-A-G-E-359
350 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
hot water is wanted at once, and will be drawn off long before 
the water in the boiler is heated to its boiling point. In the case 
of the coal range, the water may be heated to boiling, since it 
is not drawn off at once. If the return 
pipe from the stove were connected with 
the boiler at the top, steam would collect 
in the upper part, while the water at the 
bottom might be considerably below the 
boiling point. If the steam is made to 
enter the boiler half way up and there to 
mix with the water, the lower temperature 
of this water will condense the steam and 
the heat will be distributed more evenly. 
Sometimes an “expansion” pipe passes 
from the top of the boiler to the tank up- 
stairs. The purpose of this is not so much 
to allow for expansion as to furnish an 
outlet for the air that is set free from solu- 
tion in the cold water when the latter is 
heated. The cold water pipe from the 
tank allows for expansion in the boiler. 
Note.—The term “boiler” is incorrectly applied to the tank 
in the kitchen. The water is really heated in the water back 
or in the coils of the gas heater. The “boiler” is only a storage 
tank, by means of which large amounts of water may be heated 
at one time. 
  339. Circulation Pipe. Many persons are bothered by 
having to draw off considerable cold water from the hot water 
faucet before hot water comes out. This is because the boiler 
is some distance away, and the hot water, standing for some 
time in the connecting pipe, has cooled. To prevent this waste

placed in the hot water system (Fig. 329). This pipe connects 
the lower part of the boiler with the hot water supply pipe at 
a point beyond the last branch. By means of this the water, 
as it cools, is kept circulating in the supply pipe. In this way, 
when we desire hot water, it is necessary to draw from a faucet 
only the water that stands in the branch pipe which leads from 
the main hot water pipe to the faucet. 
340. Direct Hot Water Supply. In this system the cold 
water supply comes to the boiler directly from the main pipe 
instead of from a tank. The pressure of such a supply, if it is 
from the city mains, is considerably greater than that from a 
tank in the top of the house. Consequently there must be a much — 
stronger boiler to withstand this extra pressure. The expansion 
of the water must either bring about a pressure backwards upon 
the water in the main, or be cared for by means of a check valve. 
The distribution of the hot water is the same as in an indirect 
supply system. . 
341. Freezing of Water Pipes. Many fatal explosions of 
water backs in stoves have occurred when people have started 
fires in the stoves after very cold nights. During the night the 
water in the pipes that connect the water back with the boiler 
has frozen, so that there is no chance for expansion of water 
in the water back when the fire is started. The result is gener- 
ally the bursting of the water back. Too great precaution can- 
not be taken in the matter of starting fires in heaters where 
there is any possibility of frozen water pipes. 
342. Closet Tank. The closet tank serves the purpose of 
supplying a large volume of water in a short interval of time for 
flushing water-closets, in order to remove waste matter thor- 
oughly and rapidly. This tank is similar to the house tank, but 352 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS /

is smaller. The inlet is regulated by a ball cock and float, while 
at the outlet there is a stopper which is lifted when the chain 
that is attached to a lever is pulled+ 
Tanks as used to supply water to water-closets are of two 
classes : those from which water flows only as long as the chain 
is pulled, and those which become nearly empty when once the 
chain is pulled, whether or not it is 
soon released. 
To the first class belong the old- 
fashioned tanks, the stopper in which 
is hinged and remains up only when 
held up (Fig. 330). When released, 
it is forced into its seat by the pres- 
sure of the water above. ae 
To the second class belong the Fis. 330.—OLp Form o¥     Boi ock 
  
CLoser TANK 
many types of modern tanks. They 
differ mainly in the manner in which the tank is emptied, when 
once the stopper is lifted from its seat. One of the simplest 
of these is that represented in section by Figure 331a.? In this 
the outlet valve consists of a soft hollow rubber ball r, which 
fits snugly into the cup-shaped opening s. As long as this ball 
is in place, the pressure of the water above holds it down firmly 
and no water gets by. If, however, the ball is lifted by the 
chain pull, the added water pressure upwards underneath is 
sufficient to keep it buoyed up as long as it is covered with 
water. The water flows out through the outlet f until the level 
icrops about half way down the sides of the rubber ball. The 
[: then drops back into place by its own weight, which now

i knob that is pressed to set the tank in operation,

-P-A-G-E-363
354 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
produces a greater downward pressure than that of the water 
upwards underneath it. 
In another form of tank, siphonic action is the working 
principle. This is started by the lifting of the valve v (Fig. 
331b). In this tank the water level in the tube @ is the same 
as that in the tank, when it is not in action. When the valve v 
is raised, water flows through the opening into the flush pipe f. 
  N 
( N N N

  Fic. 331.—Mopern CLosetT TANKS 
When v is closed, on the release of the chain pull, this water 
in the flush pipe acts as a piston pulling downwards, and makes 
the water in @ rise above the bend between a and b and over- 
flow into b. Siphonic action starts and water flows through a 
and b until the tank level reaches d, the lower end of a. The 
siphon flow is broken by the air which now enters a, and the 
tank refills to the level shown. 
343. Fixtures. Fixtures include such appliances as faucets, 
tubs, bowls, sinks, water-closets. Faucets serve to regulate the 
supply of water from the pipes. Sinks, bowls, and tubs serve 
as receptacles for water for bathing and washing purposes. 
Water-closets serve to remove waste matter from the house. 
344. Faucets. Faucets, as used to regulate the quantity 
of water that passes out of the pipes, are of several types, of

WASTE REMOVAL 
346. Sewerage System in a House. While a pure water 
supply is very essential to health, the proper removal of waste, 
both liquid and solid, is of vital importance. 
The removal of garbage does not concern the plumbing 
system of a house. The removal of sewage in the form of dirty 
water that has been used for bathing or cleansing purposes, as 
well as of human excreta, takes place through the sewerage 
system of a house. This starts at the sinks, bowls, tubs, and 
closets, and ends at the cesspool or city sewer. It consists of a 
system of pipes called the plumbing stack. There is one large 
pipe (Fig. 336) which passes nearly vertically through the 
house. This is called the soil pipe, which, through branches
-P-A-G-E-366
RAN NE IONE FEO ENB NDEI EE NIE IONE IIL RONG 
fixtures. When water enters any of these 
waste pipes, all of which slant somewhat 
toward the soil pipe, it flows down to this 
pipe, through which it passes to the house 
drain and thus out of the house. 
Such an arrangement seems simple 
enough, the force of gravity acting to 
make everything flow to the lowest point, 
the sewer. Unfortunately, sewer gas from 
decomposing substances in the sewer may 
rise through the soil pipe, and, unless in 
some way checked, can pass through the 
branch pipes into the house, thus con- 
taminating the air supply. To prevent 
such an occurrence, traps are placed in 
the waste pipes below the fixtures. 
347. Traps. Traps are water seals. 
  In their construction (Fig. 337) advan- Fie. 336.—PLuMBING 
tage is taken of the fact that a gas will not STACK 
force its way into water to a lower point, unless its pressure is 
  greater than that upon the 
water surface at the other 
side of the bend. Just as 
long as the pressure of the 
air in the soil pipe is the 
same as that of the air on 
the fixture side of the trap, 
no movement caused by air 
pressure on the two arms € 
Fic. 337.—TRAP a@ and b will occur. If,
-P-A-G-E-367
358 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
however, the water level on the side a@ rises through water 
coming down from the fixture above, the level on the side 
will rise also, until it reaches the opening into c, through which 
water will flow into the soil pipe. This action will go on just 
as long as the level in @ is higher than the opening into c. 
When the water ceases to come from the fixture above, the level 
in both arms will drop to a little below the level of the opening. 
The water below the line of ¢ is called the water seal. 
348. Refrigerator Trap. A water 
seal is utilized in the refrigerator trap 
(Fig. 338), by which water from the 
melted ice may pass down and out from 
the ice chamber, overflowing into the 
drip pan as the level rises inside the tube. 
No warm air can get back into the re- 
frigerator because of this water seal. 
Fic. 338. REFRIGER- 349. Types of Traps. The trap de- 
scribed in Section 346 is called the drum 
trap. It is made in many forms, in one of which a slight 
upward curve of the inlet pipe makes the water swirl around 
inside the trap, forcing out any solid matter that would other- 
wise settle to the bottom and clog the trap. 
Of late years another type of trap known 
as the S trap has come into extensive use. 
In this (Fig. 339) the large chamber of the 
drum trap is replaced by a continuation of 
the pipe that passes downward from the fix- 
ture. With the introduction of this form of 
trap, which is very easily made and qutite 
economical, a trouble known as siphonage 
is encountered. Fic. 339—S Trap 
   
-P-A-G-E-368
PLUMBING 359 
350. Siphonage of Traps. Let Figure 339 represent a sec- 
tional view of a trap of the S type, with the water seal ab. 
Suppose a large volume of water enters the side a from the 
fixture. The level in b rises and the water flows over into ¢, 
where it forms a piston and siphonic action starts. As a result, 
when the flow of water from above a ceases, the level in a drops . 
down below d until air can pass up the side b and thus break 
the siphon flow. In this manner nearly all the water in a and b 
is removed, so that there is not enough to seal the lower bend 
completely. Since ¢ is connected with the soil pipe, it is easy 
to see that if there is any sewer gas in the pipe, it can readily 
pass up into the house through the fixture. 
351. Venting of Traps. In order to diminish the possibility 
of the loss of water seals in traps through siphonage, a system 
of venting has been introduced. An opening 
made in the top of the bend between b and c 
(Fig. 340) prevents siphonic action, since the } | 
atmosphere is then continually acting on the | 
water there, and thus 
breaks the continuous 
stream between 0 and c. 
The water level of a 
can drop only slightt Fic. 340 
below the bend between VeNTiNe 
b and c when.the supply from above 
stops. The inertia of the moving column 
alone makes it fall below this level. 
The latest plumbing regulations in 
some localities require that vents for 
Fr; traps shall be continuous. In such a sys- IG. 341.—CONTINUOUS . .

pipe from the trap passes horizontally into the wall of a house 
and passes down to the soil pipe through a continuation of the 
vent pipe. Such a form of trap is called the half S trap. 
In the modern system of venting traps, another vertical pipe 
known as the main vent pipe is added to the stack (Fig. 336). 
This pipe starts at the lowest fixture and passes to the roof of the 
house. To it pass the vent pipes from all the traps. Through 
this main vent pipe air at atmospheric pressure acts upon the 
top of each trap, thus preventing the possibility of siphonage. 
352. Non-Siphon Unvented Trap. Many traps in which 
siphonic action cannot take place have been invented. The time 
is undoubtedly coming when such a trap will be generally intro- 
duced, and the large expense of venting in 
houses will be eliminated; for in spite of the 
law to the effect that traps must be vented, there 
is a possibility that the water seal will be broken 
through causes other than siphonage. Common- 
est of these is evaporation. The water in both 
arms of the water seal of a vented trap is exposed 
to the atmosphere, on one side a directly through 
Fic. 342-Non- the fixture, and on the other side b indirectly 
SrpHon Trap : + through the vent pipe. If the fixture is left un- 
used for any great length of time, the water will evaporate to 
such an extent that there will be a free passage for gas through 
the trap. This will not happen so readily in a non-siphon un- 
vented trap, as in this there is a chance for evaporation on only 
one side of the water seal. Figure 342 represents in section one 
of the good non-siphoning traps. 
353. Grease Trap. From the kitchen sink, large quantities 
  1 Sometimes the soil pipe passes through the roof, and the main vent pipe is connected to it 
‘iwst below the roof.
-P-A-G-E-370
PLUMBING 361 
of unnecessarily greasy waste are often allowed to pass into 
the trap and waste pipe. This results in a large loss. As long as 
the water is warm, the grease is in a more or less liquid state. 
As it cools in the trap, however, it solidifies and collects on the 
walls, thus interfering with the proper working of the trap. 
The vent pipe may even become clogged with grease to such an 
extent that there is nothing to prevent siphonage. 
In ordinary drum or S traps, there is a cap that may be un- 
screwed, either to remove any obstruction or to clean out the 
vent pipe that has been stopped up with grease. In the best 
forms of traps these caps are on the bottom or on the sides 
below the water surface. (See e, Figs. 337 and 339.) 
To prevent an accumulation of grease in the vent pipe, 
grease traps are frequently placed under kitchen sinks, particu- 
larly in restaurants and hotel kitchens. Figure 343 represents 
the section of one form of such a 
grease trap. The trap fits into the 
sink, the top of it being level 
with the bottom of the sink. The 
greasy water enters the trap 
through the holes h h h, and rises 
in a and b to the level of the out- 
let pipe as indicated. Cold water 
passes around the central part a , 
thus cooling the waste water, and 
causing the grease to solidify. 
The grease, being less dense than 
water, floats upon the upper part 
in b. To remove the grease, the 
central part a b is lifted out. 
When this is done the cylinder d Fic. 343-—Grease Trap 
 
-P-A-G-E-371
362 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
fits into a groove around the base ¢ and is lifted by c. Thus no 
grease can get out, though the water in @ and b can pass through 
the hole 0. The cylinder d can then be slipped off upwards and 
the grease can be scraped from the outer surface of a. Soap 
can be made from this grease. 
354. Water-Closets. Water-closets are of various forms. 
In all of them there is a water seal, the closet itself forming a 
trap. Of the forms of closets in use today, we have, in the order 
in which they have been adopted, the short hopper, wash out, 
wash down, siphon, and siphon jet closets. 
355. Short Hopper Closet. This is the oldest type of closet 
permitted by law in communities where there are regulations 
concerning plumbing fixtures. The water seal (Fig. 344) 
4 connects the hopper or bowl with 
the waste pipe a. The trap is vented 
through b, The waste pipe a leads to 
the soil pipe. When the closet is 
flushed, water enters at the top, and 
passes around the rim, through which 
b it flows down the sides of the hopper. 
Fic. 344.—Suort Horrzr The disadvantage of this type is that 
Cuoser the hopper is dry when not in use, and 
it may become foul smelling, as the water at flushing may not 
clean it thoroughly. Such a type of closet is used mostly because 
of its cheapness. It is inclosed in woodwork. 
356. Wash Out Closet. In this form of closet (Fig. 345) 
there is added a shelf s in which there is water when the closet 
' isnot in use. The trap is of the same form as in the short hopper 
closet, but instead of being separate from the closet proper, it 
is a part of it, so that the whole closet is of one piece. 
357. Wash Down Closet. In this type, the inner arm of 
 
-P-A-G-E-372

the trap has a larger water surface, so that there is less of the bowl exposed for accumulations (Fig. 346).

358. Siphon Closet. The difference between the wash down 
and siphon types (Fig. 347) is in the outlet arm of the trap. 
While in the wash down type it leads directly to the soil pipe, 
in the siphon type it turns nearly at right angles, and is con- 
stricted at one place a. In this way water collects and acts as

is much less pronounced in any one of the three preceding types.

action is hastened by a jet of water which enters the bottom of 
the bowl. This water comes from the tank supply, which divides 
at the point where it enters the closet, a part to run around the 
rim of the bow], the other part to flow through a passage at 
the side and enter the bowl at the bottom. 
The figures representing the different types are merely one 
of many different forms of each type. The principle upon 
which all those of one type act is, however, the same. 
360. House Drain Trap. As an added precaution against 
sewer gas, a trap is placed in the house drain, just before it 
leaves the house. This is 
known ds the house drain 
trap. It is of the running 
trap type (Fig. 349), one 
of the simplest forms, and 
merely furnishes a water 
seal. A rise in the water

361. Fresh Air Inlet. Near the main house drain trap, on 
the soil pipe side of it, there is a vent pipe known as the fresh 
air inlet. This is to insure a free circulation of air through the 
soil pipe and the main vent pipe, as well as to prevent any extra 
pressure in the soil pipe from breaking the seal of the main 
trap. .

CHAPTER VIII 
THE AUTOMOBILE 
362. Automobiles are of three types, named according 
to the agent that in acting produces the motion. They are 
steam, electric and gasoline. In the first two the fuel used to 
produce the steam or ‘electricity is burned outside the engine 
itself, and with these we shall not deal in this discussion. 
All automobiles consist of a power plant called the engine 
or motor, a driving mechanism (the wheels) and a means of 
communicating. the power of the engine to the wheels, called 
the transmission. There is also a steering mechanism and a 
body for carrying purposes. 
363. Gasoline Engine. In the gasoline engine as used 
in automobiles we have what is called an internal combustion 
engine. By this we mean an engine in which the driving 
force is furnished by the heat produced when a burning 
explosion) takes place inside the engine. This explosion 
is produced by the ignition of a mixture of gasoline vapor and 
air, brought about by an electric spark. 
The engine is composed of a certain number of cylinders 
in a metal casting called a block. One end of each cylinder 
(Fig. 350) is open and the other closed with a cylinder head 
in which there are two openings called ports over which 
movable covers, called valves, fit. In the cylinders tight fit- 
ting pistons move up and down. One of the ports, called the 
inlet, is for allowing a mixture of gasoline vapor and air to 
be sucked into the cylinder and the other, called the outlet,

or exhaust, is to allow for the removal of the waste burned 
gases resulting from the explosions. The piston is connected 
with a crank on a shaft to which it imparts a rotary motion

Tn order to start a gasoline engine and get it to run itself, 
it must first be cranked. Assuming the piston to be in the 
position indicated by A (Fig. 351), a turning of the crank 
and shaft makes the piston move downwards. At the same 
time the geared wheel on the crank shaft makes two other 
geared wheels of twice the diameter turn. They make one

rotation when the crank shaft rotates twice. To these second 
geared wheels are fastened cams. These cams are so set that 
with the piston as indicated the inlet valve J is kept open during 
the downward movement of the piston. With the piston so 
moving an explosive mixture is drawn in through the inlet 
valve. When the piston reaches the lower end of the stroke 
the cam has been moved around so that the inlet valve closes. 
Tf the piston is now moved upwards, B (Fig. 351), the mixture 
in the cylinder is compressed, as both valves are closed. At 
the top of this stroke a spark is produced in the: cylinder 
head and the mixture explodes. When this happens the 
cranking ends and it is no longer necessary to move the 
piston from without. The force of the explosion C (Fig. 351) 
now makes the piston not only move downwards, but also 
impart a rotary motion to a heavy flywheel that is fastened 
to the crank shaft. (See Fig. 350.) The momentum thus given 
to this flywheel forces the piston upwards D (Fig. 351), 
downwards and upwards again. During the first upward 
stroke so imparted the right hand cam opens the outlet valve 
E and the waste gases are forced out the exhaust port, into 
the outside air, producing an explosive noise. At the end 
of this upward stroke, the outlet valve closes and the con- 
dition is the same in the cylinder as at the start, and the 
four operations or strokes are repeated in succession over 
and over again. The motions of the crank shaft can be 
transmitted to the wheels of the auto when we wish the 
latter to move. These four strokes are called respectively 
the intake, compression, explosion (or power), and exhaust. 
We see from this that there is a propulsive effect every four 
strokes, and for this reason the engine is called a four stroke 
cycle engine.

THE AUTOMOBILE 369 
364. Engines of More than One Cylinder. By having 
two or more cylinders in the block, all connected with the 
same crank shaft, while each cylinder produces an explosion 
effect every four strokes, it is possible to have this power 
stroke come in one cylinder at the same time that another 
stroke is taking place in the other cylinders. In this manner 
the explosive effect will be imparted to the shaft oftener than 
every four strokes; for example, in a two cylinder engine 
the explosion will come every two strokes; in a four cylinder 
engine every stroke; in a six cylinder one every two-thirds 
of a stroke, and in an eight cylinder on every half stroke. 
With each additional cylinder the added frequency of the 
explosion makes the effect of each one less noticeable and 
the exhaust effect becomes like a purr. The total driving 
c of the engine also increases with added cylinders. 
365. Carburetor. The explosive mixture of gasoline 
xapor and air that is sucked into the cylinders on each intake 
aroke results from the vaporization of gasoline liquid and 
the mixing of this with the proper amount of air to make it 
explosive. These two processes are brought about in the 
«arburetor, the action of which is controlled by the throttle 
nthe driving wheel or by the accelerator, which is a foot- 
trottle. The carburetor (Fig. 352) is automatically kept 
[i with a definite amount of gasoline liquid by means   
    
  
‘fa float valve. The cylinders of the engine are connected 
‘sith the carburetor by a pipe called the inlet manifold. Over 
the gasoline air is drawn in through a pipe by the suction 
fect of the piston as it moves down on the intake stroke. 
[: air in passing over the liquid gasoline makes it evaporate

-P-A-G-E-379
} 370 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
of this mixture that passes to the cylinders of the engine is}’ 
regulated by a valve T (Fig. 352) which is controlled by the 
throttles. The difference in the action of the hand and foot- 
throttles is that the hand-throttle stays where it is left, while 
the foot one springs back when the foot is removed.

366. Choke. A mixture that will explode when hot will 
not do so readily when cold. A larger proportion of gaso- 
line vapor is needed. This is called a richer mixture. To 
start a cold engine the opening through which the air enters 
the carburetor is made smaller, to shut off the air supply. 
This is called choking and is controlied by a knob on the 
dash board which is pulled out to shut the valve C (Fig. 352)- 
367. Spark Plug. Distributor. The explosions in the 
cylinders are produced by an electric spark which passes be- 
tween two points in a spark plug at the top of each cylinder-
-P-A-G-E-380
THE AUTOMOBILE 371 
‘he timing of this spark to make it come at the time the 
iston is at the top of the compression stroke is accomplished 
y means of a distributor. This has in it a rotating cam con- 
ected with the same shaft as the valve cams, which rotates 
wice to every rotation of the crank shaft. As it moves 
iround it successively meets contact points, each of which is 
‘onnected with one of the terminals of the spark plug to 
which it belongs. Thus sparks are produced in succession 
in the cylinders. The time at which the sparks come can be 
slightly varied by means of a second lever on the steering 
wheel, called the spark lever. This regulation is necessary: 
for when the engine is being cranked and the crank shaft 
moving slowly, it is very important to have the spark come 
after the piston has reached the top of the compression stroke: 
as otherwise the explosion may make the crank rotate back- 
wards instead of forwards and thus break the arm of the 
person doing the cranking or injure the self-starter. On the 
other hand, when the engine is rotating at good speed it is 
necessary to have the spark come slightly before the top of 
the stroke, to allow for the time it takes for the explosion 
to come to its full effect. The act of making the explosion 
come after the top of the stroke is called retarding the spark: 
and that of making it come before the top is called advancing 
the spark. On some cars this is automatically controlled by 
the engine speed. 
The electricity by which the spark is produced is either 
irom a battery or an electric generator. This may be a dynamo 
7 the direct current type, or a magneto of the alternating 
ype. Ifa battery and dynamo are used together, the battery 
| of the storage type which furnishes electricity for sparking

and lighting purposes when the engine is not running; the 
dynamo doing these when the engine is running and storing 
any excess electricity in the battery for future use. 
368. Clutch. In order to communicate the motion of 
the crank shaft to the wheels there must be a means of 
tg transmission |

in the clutch, which by means of a pedal can be thrown out 
or in. This clutch (Fig. 353) consists of two parts, one of 
which, @,a, is securely fastened to the flywheel of the engine 
and the other part, b,b, to the shaft that communicates with 
the wheels through the transmission. Powerful springs, s, hold 
these two parts tightly together when the clutch is in. (This 
is when the foot is released. Stepping on the clutch pedal acts 
against the spring.)
-P-A-G-E-382
_ THE AUTOMOBILE 373 
369. Transmission. If an engine going at slow speed 
were directly connected to the rear wheels when an automo- 
bile is at a standstill, the inertia of the car would be such as 
to stop the engine when the clutch is thrown in; or if the 
engine is going very fast, put a serious strain on it, as well 
as start the car with a jerk. In order to avoid the above 
mentioned results, a series of geared wheels called the trans- 
mission is placed between the crank shaft of the engine and 
the main drive shaft that acts on the rear wheels. These 
gears are so arranged that by the use of a gear shift lever, 
near the driver, the car can be started easily and slowly on 
what is called first or low speed, and then when it has begun 
to move a shift to a higher ratio gear called second speed can 
be made, and finally the main shaft can be directly connected 
with the crank shaft of the engine. Furthermore, the trans- 
mission gears make it possible to impart a reverse motion to 
the rear wheels with the engine shaft rotating the same way 
as for forward motion. A four stroke gasoline engine can 
rotate only one way. 
370. Transmission Gear Action. The four actions of 
the transmission gears may be represented by the diagrams 
(Fig. 354) in which the cog wheel C is represented as con- 
nected with the free side of the clutch. In low speed position

(a) this wheel meshes with L, which rotates one-fourth as 
fast as the engine shaft. In the second speed position (0) the 
wheel C meshes with S, which then rotates one-third as fast 
as the engine shaft. In high speed (c) it meshes with H, 
which then rotates at the same speed as the engine shaft. 
Wheels L, S, and H are all supposed to be connected directly 
to the main driving shaft to which they impart their motion. 
A fourth position (d) makes the wheel C mesh with an idle 
cog wheel which in turn meshes with wheel L. The motion 
thus imparted to L will be in the opposite direction from that 
when C meshes directly with L, and the car moves backward. 
371. Differential. The main drive shaft which con- 
nects the transmission gears with the rear wheel axle is at 
right angles with the latter. The motion of the shaft is com— 
municated to the axle by a pair of bevel gears A,B (Fig. 355)» 
which revolve at right angles with each other. These gears 
are in a housing which covers the rear axle. This axle is 
divided into two parts, one for each wheel. This is necessary, 
for if the wheels were connected by a rigid axle the car 
could not go in a curved direction without one or the other 
of the wheels sliding (just as do the wheels of a trolley car 
when it rounds a curve, and to aid in which the tracks are 
greased). These two halves of the rear axle are each con— 
nected at the inner end with bevel gears C, which mest 
with gears D that rotate loosely on the ends of the casing H” 
(Fig. 355). This in turn is fastened to and turns with the 
gear B that meshes with the drive gear A on the main shaft- 
By such an arrangement known as the differential, the motiom 
imparted by the drive shaft can be divided between the two 
wheels either equally or unequally as the conditions require,
-P-A-G-E-384
the other standing still; or each receive an equal amount, as 
when the car is moving along in a straight line. Should one 
wheel be on a slippery spot and the other not, then the first 
wheel will spin around when an attempt is made to move the 
car by means of the engine, because of the presence of this 
differential.

372. The Wheels. Inasmuch as the driving force of 
fhe engine is communicated through the wheels, these are 
‘olted securely to the rear axle. The front wheels on the 
‘ther hand are not so fastened to the front axle, but rotate 
reely on the front bearings. These, besides serving as a 
)-:pport for the front end of the car, are for determining 
ft direction the car will move. These wheels are 
      
  ied by means of the steering wheel, which is connected
-P-A-G-E-385
with each other and thus turn together. 
373. Brakes. While the process of making a car move 
is very important, an even more important thing is the stop- 
ping of it when it is going. This is done by means of brakes, 
of which there are two kinds, called hand and foot brakes, 
according as they are operated by the use of that particular 
part of the body. The foot brake is the one depended upon 
usually when the car is moving, and the hand brake is used 376 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
with them by rods. The two wheels are directly connected 
to keep the car from moving when it is at rest.

CHAPTER 1X 
RADIO 
374, Radio Waves. We have learned in the study of 
heat (Sections 90-93) (a) that molecular vibrations can set up 
waves in the ether, called respectively heat and light waves; 
(6) that we have sense organs which are affected by these 
waves, making us feel warm and see light; (c) that heat and 
light waves can be of different length, depending on the 
rapidity of vibration of the molecules. Now these same mble- 
cules, that in vibrating can produce ether waves which affec 
us, can also produce ether waves which do not affect us. 
When an electric spark passes between two objects of 
different potential, or when a magnetic field around a wire 
is very rapidly or suddenly changed, electromagnetic waves 
are set up in the ether. d This occurs when we turn on or off 
an electric lamp, electric iron, motor or other electrical ap- 
pares Jth se_waves ate today called radig waves because

speech with which we are 
dil familar These waves travel in all directions over the 
earth just as do heat and light waves, but as they do not affect 
tls we are not ordinarily aware of their existence. 
375. Reception of Radio Waves. As we have no sense 
3 organ with which to recognize radio waves, scientists have 
{ produced a piece of apparatus that as sensitive to them. This 
when affected by them transforms’ this effect into one of 
4 379

sound, which does act on our ears. This apparatus is called 
a Radio Receiving Set. 
Before we can understand the workings of this receiver, 
however, we must know something about how the waves are 
produced and in what form they come to us. If a radio 
receiving set is put in operation and there are no radio waves 
affecting it, you will hear very little in the way of sound from 
it, except what the set itself is producing. If, however, it 
has been adjusted (tuned) to waves from a particular send- 
ing (broadcasting) station, then just as soon as that station 
begins to send out waves there will be a rushing heard from 
| il

the head phones of the receiving set. Then there will be vari- 
ations of this rushing sound which we recognize as those of 
musical instruments or voices. The first rushing sounds are 
produced by what are called carrier waves, produced by an 
instrument called an oscillator, which is producing electrical 
vibrations at a regular rate (frequency). Each station has 
a definite vibration frequency assigned to it. 
Fic. 357. — REPRESENTATION OF SOUND WAVES 
376. Speed and Length of Radio Waves. The speed 
of radio waves is the same as of light and heat waves, namely, 
186,000 miles a second. This is equal to 300,000,000 meters 
a second. Now if the vibration frequency of the oscillator 
of a station is 1,000,000 a second, then the wave length of 
the waves produced will be 300,000,000 meters divided by 
1,000,000, which is 300 meters. , ‘ 
377. Terms Applied to Radio Waves. The waves pro- 
duced by the oscillator are called radio frequency or carrier 
2 waves (Fig. 356) and serve the same purpose in radio that the 
1 wires furnish in the ordinary telephone. As you will remember 
@ ‘Section 250), in the telephone when sound waves come into 
|. transmitter they make the diaphragm vibrate and thus pro-

duce variations in the strength of the current that is flowing 
through the transmitter circuit, thus bringing about a change 
in strength of the magnets of the receivers. Now in a- 
similar manner a transmitter, called a microphone, is connected 
in the oscillator circuit that is sending out the radio frequency

(carrier) waves, so that when sound waves act on this trans- 
mitter, variations in the carrier waves result (Fig. 358) 
These produce variations in the strength of the current that 
js produced in the receiving apparatus, and these variations 
of the rushing sound produced by the radio frequency

RADIO 38 3, 
(carrier) waves cause the sound waves that we recognize 
as the voice or music. 
The variations of the radio frequency waves which travel 
along on the carrier waves are called audio frequency or 
rider waves. It is these with which we are most interested, 
once the set has been adjusted to the particular carrier waves 
of the station to which we are listening. 
378. It is not the purpose of this book to explain in 
| detail how the carrier and rider waves are produced further 
than to say that at the sending station where the oscillator is 
located a wire called an antenna or aerial extends outward 
into the air and another is connected to the ground. This 
wire serves as a means of producing the waves in the ether. 
What we are interested in is the 
reception of both these kinds of 
waves, “and the transforming of 
them into sound waves. Antenna

make the top become alternately positive and negative, the 
bottom being the opposite. 
379. If now a telephone receiver is connected in the wire 
(Fig. 360) the result will be a current first one way and 
then the other through its coils. This will, however, change

in direction so fast that the iron disc of the telephone teceiver 
will not have a chance to move one way before the effect will 
be in the opposite direction. As a result the receiver disc 
does not vibrate.

RADIO : , 385, 
380. Crystal Detector. It has been found that crystals. 
of certain minerals, among them Galena, have the property: 
of allowing e icity to pass through 1 i ond 
direction when the tip of a small wire rests on them. This: 
direction is from crystal to wire. . 
With such a crystal inserted in the antenna telephone, 
ground circuit (Fig. 361) one-half of the induced effect is. 
temoved from the telephone, and. the one Jeft will be all 
in Ofie direction, though not steady. To this the disc of the. 
telephone will respond, though very faintly. 
If with such an arrangement set-up the waves-at the 
sending station are changed (modulated) by means of a 
microphone placed in the oscillator circuit, these changes will 
show themselves in the radio frequency waves in the form: 
of irregularities (Fig. 358). These irregularities are of 
sound wave frequency, which are from 40 to 25,000 per sec- 
ond as compared with 1,000,000 a second, the frequency of 
the radio waves. These changes at audio frequency, taking 
place in the antenna to crystal to telephone to ground circuit, 
will produce an appreciable effect on the iron disc of the tele- 
phone and make it vibrate in unison with these audio fre- 
quency variations, thus causing the production of sound waves 
that come to the ears from the telephone receivers. 
The above is a description of the simplest form of radio 
teceiver. The effect is very faint and the waves must come 
from a sending station that is nearby and be very powerful 
! to produce much effect. The development of radio sets has 
been along lines that will intensify the effect produced by the 
tlectromagnetic waves, thus enabling a set to receive very 
weak effects from distant stations and make them audible.
-P-A-G-E-395
386 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
All sets receive the waves in 
any locality. The difference in 
fhem lies in the amount they 
magnify the weak impulses. 
381. Tuning. The simple 
set as above described will be 
affected by waves of any length 
from any station, so that if 
waves of two or more different 
lengths are coming together, 
both will act on the set and a 
mixture of sounds result. Just 
as there is one particular tun- 
ing fork (see Section 182) that 
vibrates in unison with another, 
so there is one particular length 
of wire that corresponds with 
any sending station wave length. 
The first step in the develop- 
ment was the matter of making 
the length of the antenna of the ingle Slide 
Tuning Coil 
Fic. 362 
receiving set adjustable, so as to vary it to agree with the 
wave length of the different stations, and thus make it selec- 
tive, responding only to the waves of the station desired. This 
is accomplished somewhat by putting a coil of wire between 
the antenna and crystal, and having the antenna connected 
with a slider that can be moved along the coil; the other end 
of which being connected with the crystal (Fig. 362). The 
act of changing the amount of this coil that is in the antenna 
to ground circuit is called varying the inductance. The coil 
is called a slider tuning coil, and the process called tuning.
-P-A-G-E-396
RADIO 387 
382. Double Slide Tuner. The presence of: 
the crystal and the telephone on the same circuit 
as the antenna and ground wires makes consid- 
erable resistance for the current (weak under 
any condition) to pass through. By putting these 
on a separate circuit (Fig. 
Double Stide 363) the main current flows 
Tuning Coil easily up and down the 
antenna circuit and the ef- 
fect of this is imparted by 
self-inductance (see Sec- 
tion 386) to the telephone 
circuit. There is a second 
slider on this circuit and the coil is called a 
double slider tuning coil. 
       
   
    
  383. Coupling. By introducing a second 
= coil (Fig. 364) and connecting the crystal 
and telephone to this coil, still better recep- 
Fie. 363 tion is secured. In this case the current in 
the antenna circuit flows freely up and down. 
As it does so, it produces a magnetic field about the antenna 
(primary) coil. A current is induced in the secondary coil, 
the crystal detector eliminating one-half of it. This process 
is called coupling and the two coils called a coupler. 
Couplers are of two sorts, one called a loose coupler, in 
which one coil slides inside the other, and the other called 
a vario-coupler, in which the secondary rotates inside the 
primary. The intensity of the current in the telephone cir- 
cuit is greatly intensified by the use of a. coupler. The
-P-A-G-E-397
388 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
amount of induction in the sec- 
ondary coil is varied by moving 
the secondary. Tuning is done 
by means of the primary coil. 
384. Capacity. Tuning by 
means of varying the number 
of turns in the coil of the an- 
tenna circuit is called tuning 
by inductance. In this method 
more turns (inductance) are 
added to the antenna for waves 
of greater length. 
Another method of tuning 
is by means of capacity. In 
this a condenser is used. A Coupler . : Tuning Coil condenser consists of two : 
metal plates, generally small 
sheets of tinfoil, with either 
air or some other insulating == 
material between them. They . Fia. 364 are called variable or fixed, ac- 
cording as to whether or not it is possible to vary the 
amount of the metal that is brought into use. In the fixed 
form (Fig. 365) two pieces of tinfoil are separated by a

thin piece of mica. In the variable form of condenser 
(Fig. 366) a number of segments (generally half circles) 
are fastened to a frame and a second group like them 
but smaller is fastened to a pivot the turning of which will 
make one set pass between the other. The amount of capacity 
of the condenser depends on how much of the rotatin: 
is between the others.

Capacity is measured in terms of farads. This, however, 
is much too large for ordinary use, so the term microfarad, 
or one millionth of a farad, is used. 
385. Condenser in Circuit. If the rotary plates of a 
condenser are attached to one wire of a circuit and the fixed 
(stationary) plates to the other wire, then capacity is said 
to be put into the circuit, Joining one set of plates to the 
antenna, and the other to the tuning coil, places capacity in 
the antenna circuit. This brings about the same result as 
adding more turns to the tuning coil circuit: it makes the 
receiving set tuned to longer wave length. The advantage 
that the condenser has over the coil in tuning is that it can 
be adjusted much more finely and so enables one to tune to 
wave lengths that are slightly different (see Fig. 369).
-P-A-G-E-399

386. Inductance. Just as a current of varying strength 
flowing through the primary of a transformer induces a 
current in the secondary, so does the same current induce a 
current in the adjacent turns of the coil in which it is flowing. 
This current is self-induced and is called inductance. It flows 
in the opposite direction from the current that causes it and 
therefore opposes this current, making it weaker. The intro- 
duction of such an inductance in the antenna circuit has the 
same effect as adding length of wire to the antenna. 
387. Condenser in Parallel. Placing a condenser in 
parallel with the antenna tuning coil (Fig. 369) has the 
effect of making the antenna shorter. The action of such a 
condenser in parallel with any apparatus such as a telephone 
receiver (Fig. 369) shows itself only when the current is 
changing in strength, either alternating or pulsating. The 
tendency of any flow of electricity through a wire is to be 
continuous and steady. It opposes any change. That is 
why a spark occurs when an electric circuit is broken.. The 
tendency to continue flowing makes the electricity jump the 
gap after the wires are separated. If, however, a condenser 
is connected with the two sides of the wire where the break 
occurs, the charge instead of jumping the gap, rushes into 
the condenser, which, when thus charged extra, discharges 
back and thus makes the break or change in the current more 
abrupt and pronounced. Thus we get a clearer effect in a 
telephone receiver when a condenser is in parallel with it. 
Condensers are often used in various places on a radio cir- 
cuit to produce smoother effects. 
388. The Vacuum Tube. A number of years ago 
Thomas Edison, inventor of the electric incandescent lamp,
-P-A-G-E-400
RADIO . , 391 
discovered that if he inserted a second wire in the bulb and 
joined this wire to the positive side of a battery, connecting 
the negative side of this battery to the battery that was light- 
ing the filament of the lamp, there would be a flow of elec- 
| tricity through this second wire circuit, though there was 
apparently no electrical connection inside the tube (Fig. 367). 
This flow took place only when the lamp was lighted and

* Fic. 367.— Tue Epison Errecr 
when the second wire was connected to the positive side of 
the battery. Our modern knowledge of electricity explains 
this effect as due to the fact that the hot filament is sending 
out tiny particles, called electrons, that are charged with nega- 
tive electricity. The second wire, being attached to the posi- 
tive side of the battery, is charged positively and attracts 
these negatively charged electrons to it, thus providing a path 
for the passage of electricity through the stream of electrons. 
389. Three Element Tube. The modern radio vacuum 
tube was invented by DeForest, who discovered that if a
-P-A-G-E-401
392 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
third’ wire called a grid (Fig. 368) is inserted between the | 
second wire above mentioned and the filament, the current | 
-between the second wire called the plate (because of its large 
surface) can be varied. This is brought about by charging 
this grid wire with varying amounts of positive and negative 
electricity. With a positive charge on the grid the current

or THREE ELEMENT TUBE 
increases, as this extra positive attraction causes the negative 
electrons to pass across to the plate more readily ; while with 
the grid negatively charged, the negative electrons are re- 
pelled and the current flow is diminished. 
_ If the grid of such a three element tube is attached to 
one end of the secondary coil where the crystal is attached 
(in Fig, 364) and the filament to the other end, the alternating 
current produced in the primary coil by the incoming waves 
will alternately charge the grid positively and negatively, and 
thus alternately strengthen and weaken the current that flows
-P-A-G-E-402
RADIO 393 
in the plate circuit. If the telephone receiver is placed on 
this plate circuit (Fig. 369), these variations in current 
strength will cause the discs to vibrate and produce sound 
Waves. : 
The battery that lights the filament and thus produces © 
the negative electrons is called the “A” battery. The battery . 
that supplies the steady current through the head phones and 
plate circuit is called the “B” battery. A rheostat is placed 
Fic. 369.— Trex ELEMENT TUBE USED IN PLACE OF CRYSTAL Variable Fixed 
“Condenser Condenser 
  between the “A” battery and the filament to control the 
amount of current that passes through it, and thus keep the 
filament from becoming overheated and melting (burning 
out). 
390. Amplification. If instead of placing the telephone 
teceiver in the plate circuit (Fig. 370), we attach there the 
primary coil of a transformer, then the voltage of the pri- 
mary will be multiplied by the transformer according to the
-P-A-G-E-403
394 HOUSEHOLD PHYSICS 
ratio of the number of turns in secondary and primary coils 
of the transformer. If the ends of the secondary coils are 
then connected to the grid and filament of a second vacuum 
tube, the increased voltage produced by the transformer will 
act on the grid and thus increase by a much greater amount 
the plate current in the second tube, thus amplifying the 
changing strength of current through the telephone receiver. 
In this manner a feeble current on the first plate circuit can

he made greater in the second; and by continuing the process 
using more tubes and inserting the primary of the trans- 
formers in place of the receivers, several amplifications can 
be produced. It is in this way that the very weak waves from 
distant stations can be made to produce a loud sound from 
the head phones or loud speaker. 
391. Regeneration. If the current that flows through 
the plate circuit of a vacuum tube is made to pass through 
a coil also (Fig. 371), this coil, called a tickler, can be brought 
near the tuning coil and (by induction) the fluctuating cur- 
rent that flews through the plate circuit can cause an added a a 
  , Weenies cage" -

LLL Ea ren msn RADIO. 395 
variation in the voltage impressed on the grid. This will in 
turn increase the current in the plate circuit, which will in turn 
react on the grid of the tube through the coil on the plate 
circuit. In this way a very large effect can be produced on 
the grid. Thus by this process known as regeneration, a 
result can be obtained similar to that secured by the use of 
transformers and extra tubes. There is, however, a limit to

the amount of this feeding back of the plate current, for 
finally a squeal or howl is heard in the receiver. When this 
happens the tube is said to oscillate. In this condition it is 
acting as a transmitter, sending out radio waves, which, act- 
ing on other receiving sets, produce the squeals and howls 
known as local interference. The regenerative set works 
best when the feed back is carried almost to the point of 
oscillation.

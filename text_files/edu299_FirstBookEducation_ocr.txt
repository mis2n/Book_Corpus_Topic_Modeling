  PREFACE 
This book has been written from the viewpoint of 
the beginning student of education. Our normal 
schools and teachers’ colleges introduce the student 
to the study of education through a discussion of the 
topics treated herein. The difficulty in the past has 
been to find the desired information in accessible form, 
and this book is an attempt to present a composite 
view of the field of elementary education as well as 
the ideals and aims of the various divisions of this 
field. 
In order to insure the establishment of the school 
for the child and to deny the conformity of the child 
to a rigid school system, the development, physical and 
mental, of the child as he goes through school is the 
basis upon which to build our system of education. 
The discussion in this book follows this plan. The 
four divisions of the elementary system—primary, 
intermediate, junior high, and rural schools—are con- 
sidered in turn, and the mental and physical charac- 
teristics of the pupils in each division carefully noted. 
These characteristics are indicated as possible bases for 
classroom procedure. No discussion of methods has 
been made as it was felt that such discussion did not 
fall, primarily, within the province of this book. How- 
ever, there has been no hesitancy in referring to meth- 
ods whenever such reference would clarify the meaning

of the text. Ultra-modern points of view have not 
been presented nor have past practices been condemned 
because they are old, but rather the attempt has been 
made to bring the old up to date and introduce the 
modern only when such introduction is thoroughly 
justified. 
A chapter on discipline has been included, as it was 
felt that a knowledge of the fundamental principles 
of discipline was essential to an understanding of class- 
room procedure. It is hoped that this chapter may be 
helpful to the novice teacher in securing and holding 
her class from the first, without much of that “trying 
out” period which so sorely besets the inexperienced 
teacher. 
It is with the hope that this book will inspire the 
young student of education to look upon teaching as a 
science, based upon definite laws, that this book is 
presented to the profession. 
The author is indebted to many. It is impossible 
to mention them all. The influence of McMurry, 
Briggs, Bagley, Snedden, Colvin, and others is readily 
seen in the text. To these, his former teachers, he 
would acknowledge his inspiration. Especially to the 
Bureau of Publication, Teachers College, New York 
City, for permission to reproduce tests published by 
it, and to Scott, Foresman and Company for permission 
to use parts of Landsittel’s Observation Record Book 
are the author’s thanks hereby recorded.

CHAPTER I 
THE AIMS OF EDUCATION 
The average classroom teacher thinks little of the 
aims of education. The problems of discipline and 
the routine of school work usually keep her occupied 
to such an extent that she seldom stops to think where 
the process of education is leading. She is engaged 
in teaching, in educating, but does not consider the 
goal to be reached. 
However the classroom teacher may consider it, edu- 
cation has a goal; it has a definite end, an aim. The 
teacher may be so absorbed in the process that the 
end is obscured. Nevertheless it exists, and it is not 
an intangible something, but a real, vital, fundamental 
end, as a little thought will show. 
The definition of education—Ever since education 
has become a factor in our lives men have tried to 
define it. It is so far reaching, so complex that it 
has baffled definition. Herbert Spencer has given us 
a definition that has survived for many years, “EHdu- 
cation is preparation for complete living.” At the 
present day we are more likely to say that education 
3
-P-A-G-E-14
4 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
is life and not a preparation for life; but still we may 
accept this definition as it stands. If we take this 
point of view we needs must define “complete living” 
and undertake to find out what preparation is needed 
for it. 
Complete living—Someone has divided the day into 
three parts. According to such divisions we find our 
day giving us eight hours for work, eight hours for 
recreation, and eight for rest and sleep. Complete 
living demands that each of these periods be used 
efficiently and with pleasure and enjoyment. This 
then leads us to feel that education opens the door of 
satisfaction in living and permits us to get the most 
possible out of life. The educated person simply has 
more doors of satisfaction open to him than one who 
has not had the advantage of education. In his leisure 
time he may enjoy music, literature, art, and the like 
because his education has prepared him to appreciate 
them. During his working hours he may work more 
skilfully, more effectively or efficiently because his 
education has shown him the way. His hands are 
directed by an educated mind, and because of this he 
becomes a skilled laborer. 
Recreation a part of education—Recreation is no 
small part of education. It is essential that our bodies 
have a period of rest and quiet during which time 
they may replace and repair the tissues used in work. 
Recreation provides a change both in environment 
and action. It is true that much of our recreation
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE AIMS OF EDUCATION 5 
is aimless, but it can be made the means or much 
enjoyment, pleasure, and instruction. A walk through 
the woods may be an irksome duty if it is undertaken 
with a spirit of compulsion and with eyes not educated 
to see the beauties of nature. On the other hand, 
such a walk may be a wonderful excursion simply be- 
cause one is educated to see and enjoy. 
Mind and body—All of these considerations point 
toward the symmetrical development of both mind 
and body to the end that the educated person may be 
an efficient member of society. But efficient citizen- 
ship involves duties as well as pleasures. It is the 
duty of the educated person to contribute of his 
education in such a way and manner as will best ad- 
vance rightful living. This means good citizenship 
among other things. It means standing four-square on 
the side of right. Above all does it mean vision and 
broad-mindedness. 
The obligations of the educational system—Our 
educational system should be of such a nature that no 
matter at what point a pupil may be obliged to leave 
school he will be a better citizen, a better man, be- 
cause of the education he has received. We are likely 
to think of education as a continuous process—valuable 
if some unit of it is completed—while it should afford 
something of value regardless of the point at which 
the pupil must leave school. This then is the thought 
the teacher should have in mind as she stands in front 
of her class—how much better will these children be 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  
6 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
for having gone to school, even though the period of 
schooling be brief? If she can show that something 
has been gained that will enable the pupil to earn a 
living, appreciate his environment, and be a better 
citizen, then her teaching has been effective and 
efficient. On the other hand, if nothing or little has 
been gained such teaching is inefficient. There are 
countless numbers of teachers who see nothing beyond 
teaching than a number of lessons to be “heard” and 
fail utterly to see that teaching is more than lesson- 
hearing or the setting of tasks. On the contrary it 
should stimulate and encourage the child to make the 
most of his opportunities and to get the most out of 
life. 
The school and civilization—Our schools are the 
outposts of civilization. The Constitution follows the 
flag—the school follows the home. The history of 
colonial days tells us that after the establishment of 
the home, the next concern of the colonists was to 
establish the school. Thus the school has always been 
a factor in advancing civilization. The rural school in 
all its ugliness, standing silent and alone in the dreary 
sections of our country, is a symbol. It demonstrates 
that in our democratic country there is an educational 
opportunity the like of which cannot be found in any 
other land. The school may be poor in equipment, 
poor in instruction, but it breathes the spirit of 
America. Already we feel the quickening power of the 
new education that has for its slogan: “It is the pri-  
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE AIMS OF EDUCATION cl 
mary duty of the school to teach the child to do better 
those things he will do anyway.” When we have this 
aim of education as the foundation stone of our educa- 
tional system, we will turn out an educated product 
from our schools trained to think and act and to 
whom the doors of pleasure and enjoyment will be 
open because of the education he has received. 
Exercises 
1. What is the aim of education? 
2. How would a teacher determine whether she had 
achieved this aim? 
3. Make a list of the common branches taught in our 
schools and indicate how each one contributes 
to the aim of education. 
4, Is there any value in having children learn such 
facts as capital of states, dates in history or rules 
in arithmetic? How does such knowledge con- 
tribute to “complete living”? 
5. Not all children will complete the work of the 
grade school. What responsibility has the school 
toward the child who may not complete his 
school course? 
6. Why is education free, compulsory and universal 
in America? 
7. If it is the primary duty of the school to teach 
the child to do better those things he will do 
anyway, what are “those things he will do any- 
way”? Are they taught in our schools?
-P-A-G-E-18
8 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
8. Why should education be for leisure as well as 
work? 
9. In what sense are schools outposts of civilization? 
10. Explain the chief differences between an educated 
and an uneducated person. 
11. How is physical education involved in achieving 
the aim of education? 
12. How will education assist in making an individual 
a better citizen? 
13. Why is the teacher ordinarily but little concerned 
about the aims of education? 
14. In what respect are the aims of education the same 
in the rural school as they are in the city school?

CHAPTER II 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
Not all children who attend our public schools are 
alike. They differ in height, weight, sex, nationality, 
and in many other respects. Our educational system 
has not fully considered this, but has taken children 
as they entered our schools and attempted to put 
them through the same process with the idea of turning 
out a product that would be an exact counterpart of - 
every other product coming through the educational 
machine. It was comparable to taking a mass of 
lead, melting it, and pouring it into molds to make 
lead soldiers—each one of which would be like his 
fellows. 
Difference in mental ability—Recognition of the 
fact that children differ considerably shows us the 
absurdity of this process. Children are not alike. They 
differ in many ways; in ways vital to the teacher 
and the teaching process. Of these differences that 
of mental ability is the chief. There is a certain 
amount of native ability, original nature, or call it 
what you will, present in each child that makes him 
different from every other child. Nor are all children 
sent into life equipped with the same amount of mental 
9
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
ability. These facts alone make it imperative that 
teachers recognize individual differences and, recog- 
nizing them, adapt their teaching to conform to them. 
Basis for biologic differences—If we should count 
the number of kernels on the ears of corn found in a 
bushel we should find that some ears have a great 
many kernels, other ears have but few, while the ma- 
jority would have about the same number of kernels. 
Should we measure the height of a thousand persons 
selected at random we would find a few very tall, a 
few very short, but the majority would be about the 
same in height. Any analysis involving measurement 
in the physical world will show us the same thing. 
Nor is this all; we can forecast the percentage that 
will be found in any group. For example, in measur- 
ing the height of a thousand people, we will find 
that approximately 25% will be very tall; 25% very 
short; but that 50% of the group will be about the 
same in height. 
The normal curve of distribution—For a long time 
these facts have been known in the biologic world. 
It is only recently that we have found the same things 
to hold true in the mental world. Due to the efforts 
of Binet, Simon, Terman, Thorndike, and others we 
can now measure the amount of intelligence with which 
a child is endowed. Of course, the measuring stick 
is crude and the results not refined, yet as we gain 
in our ability to apply and measure, we are refining 
our standards. Even now, with our means of measure-
-P-A-G-E-21
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES ll 
ment crude we can determine the group to which a 
child belongs with intelligence as its basis. Thus to 
follow the grouping given above we may say that in a 
group of a thousand school children 25% will be su- 
perior, 25% dull, and 50% of average intelligence. 
Plotting this to show the existing relationships we 
obtain a curve as follows: 
  This is known as the normal curve of distribution, 
and will always be found as the result of grouping a 
large number of cases selected at random with respect 
to any given mental or physical trait. 
In actual school work we are able to refine our di- 
visions somewhat, making them as follows: 
  Necessity of the recognition of differences—It can 
be seen from the above that it is of the utmost im- 
portance to the teacher to recognize the fact that 
on the basis of mental ability alone, children are very
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
different. The average teacher can usually success- 
fully teach 75% of her group because they comprise 
the average and above-average group. It takes a real 
teacher to be able to teach not only 75% of the group, 
but a greater proportion. The above-average pupil 
will learn readily if he has but an average teacher— 
the average pupil will get along with the average 
teacher—the dull pupil needs a teacher who under- 
stands the problem of the child who is below the 
average. 
Maximum and minimum assignments—The ideal 
situation is the one in which each pupil is encouraged 
to work to the limit of his ability. This demands some 
preparation on the part of the teacher. The method 
of maximum and minimum assignments by which a 
minimum is assigned to all pupils and a maximum 
suggested will permit the bright pupil to work to the 
limit of his ability and at the same time allow the 
dull pupil to contribute to the extent to which he is 
able. This, however, is but one device used by teachers 
in school practice to secure results with children of 
varying mental abilities. 
Methods of solving the problem of individual dif- 
ferences—The problem of individual differences is de- 
manding the attention of educators and they, in turn, 
are solving the problem in various ways. / In systems 
large enough to permit of the division, we find the 
various grades divided into sections on the basis of 
ability. Thus, grade 4A might consist of the brightest
-P-A-G-E-23
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 13 
fourth graders, grade 4B would be made up of the 
average pupils, while grade 4C would contain all pupils 
classed as slow, dull, or backward. While this method 
of classification is a very good one, it is very often 
based upon the judgment of the teacher alone. It is 
sad but true that a child is often considered dull merely 
because his appearance gives that impression. His 
clothes are old and dirty, his hair uncombed, his face 
unwashed, his finger nails filthy—because of this he 
is considered stupid. On the other hand, the truly 
dull pupil may be considered much brighter than he 
really is merely because he is dressed neatly and comes 
to school with his face and hands clean and his clothes 
neat and well-brushed. When we introduce a more 
scientific method by which to separate pupils into 
groups we will be able to accomplish more than at 
present; there is undoubtedly much to be gained by 
grouping pupils into classes on the basis of their ability, 
but such grouping should be the result of scientific 
measurement rather than subjective judgment. 
The superior child—The bright child presents a 
problem just as truly as does the dull child. Our 
school systems recently have been much more con- 
cerned with the problem of the dull child than with 
the problem of the superior pupil. There seems to 
be no adequate reason why the superior pupil should 
be held back. Why not permit him to go through 
school at his rate? The chief reason is because we 
have made no provision for rapid progress through
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
the grades. Our schools are established on the basis 
of a year to a grade, and we labor with the dull to 
promote him in a year’s time, and we hold back the 
bright for fear he will be ready for promotion before 
the end of the school year. A few schools, recognizing 
the injustice done to the superior pupil, have organized 
“express classes,” traveling at a more rapid rate than 
the regular classes, thus permitting the pupil to do 
the work of more than one grade in one year. 
School reorganization—It is very likely, as attention 
is given to these problems, that a considerable amount 
of reorganization within the school will take place. 
We can already see various indications of it. It is 
more than probable that the child, on entering school, 
will be carefully measured with respect to his mental 
ability, and that his status will largely determine the 
rate of progress and type of education he will receive 
in our public schools. Much of the waste of public 
education can and will be avoided by a recognition of 
individual differences. 
The group as individuals—It is true that the prob- 
lem of classification of pupils on the basis of mental 
ability is an administrative one. Only in a small way 
is it likely to touch the school life of the classroom 
teacher. And yet, there is an aspect of individual 
differences that is the concern of every teacher. After 
we have made our mental ability divisions and have 
assigned a teacher to each division, our problem is not 
yet solved. The teacher knows that within a very
-P-A-G-E-25
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 15 
limited range the pupils in her class are of the same 
mentality, but that tells her nothing at all about 
the class as individuals. One pupil may be a bully; 
another bashful; a third sullen and stubborn; and a 
fourth cheerful and happy. The teacher discovers 
these qualities and then her real work with the class 
begins. The mentality of the class is the same; the 
characteristics of the individuals are different. The 
solution of the problem lies in binding the individuals 
of the class into a group with the dominant charac- 
teristics of loyalty, codperation, and group welfare. 
The suppression of individuality—The spirit of de- 
mocracy in our country has led us to build up a demo- 
cratic school system in which each child is subjected to 
the same kind of educative process regardless of his 
individual characteristics. The rigid discipline of our 
early schools was part and parcel of such educational 
theory. In other words, the individual was sacrificed 
to the mass. Only the group was considered; never 
the members of the group. 
How many educational crimes were committed un- 
der such a régime we can only guess. It is certain, 
from the evidence of those who have passed through 
the mill, that many longings to explore, to discover, 
to experiment, were ruthlessly suppressed. The child 
with an abundance of the power to appreciate nature, 
music, literature, and the like, was laughed at, mocked, 
until his life was made miserable. However, if he 
conformed to the group all was well.
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
Especially in our rural schools do we find some of 
this spirit left. The individual, his longings, his ideas 
must conform to the group or else he is an outcast. 
Our graded schools seem to be farther away from this 
notion, and teachers in these schools recognize that 
the individual is to be taught and that such teaching 
includes tolerance of his ideas, sympathy with his 
plans, and an understanding of his nature. We need 
teachers with these qualifications. A knowledge of 
subject matter and a thorough training in the tech- 
nique of teaching is most desirable, but more desirable 
perhaps than these is the teacher with the understand- 
ing heart who will shield the child and enter into his 
plans with enthusiasm. Our democratic society doesn’t 
need a group of individuals all alike; we have need of 
many kinds of people. We need engineers and lawyers 
and doctors, but we also have need of poets and artists 
and musicians. 
Differences due to sex—The teacher who is con- 
fronted with the task of teaching a group composed 
of boys and girls will find many striking differences 
due to sex, even though the mental range is equal. 
Schools were first established for boys alone. Girls 
were admitted reluctantly and then only with the 
understanding that they take the same subjects as 
boys. It was secretly hoped in this way that girls 
would soon drop out of school, but this has not been 
the result. The girls came to school, they stayed, 
and have done as well as the boys. Nevertheless, in
-P-A-G-E-27
  
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 7 
any class of boys and girls there are likely to be por- 
tions of the subject matter more appealing to the boys 
or vice versa. This apparent individual difference ap- 
pears in a group of just boys or just girls in much 
the same way, and the keynote of instruction is, of 
course, the major interest of the group. While we 
may find an occasional class of girls who are doing 
better work than boys (measured by school marks), 
or while we may find a group of boys doing work 
superior to that of girls (measured by the same stand- 
ard), in general we may say that boys and girls do 
equally well. That is, of the same mentality, there is 
little to choose between work accomplished by a boy or 
a girl. With respect to subjects there is more of a 
difference. The majority of girls will do better in 
a class of domestic science, although the author has 
seen a very enthusiastic class of boys in camp cookery; 
and from this class, in open competition with girls in 
bread making, a boy carried off the honors! Boys are 
likely to do better in mechanical drawing, laboratory 
work, machine or woodworking shops. Even here 
we will find some girls who will also do this work 
well. The point to keep in mind is that there will 
be an overlapping of sex ability. Some boys will 
do as well as the majority of the girls in subjects 
usually considered for girls alone, and some girls will 
excel in subjects usually thought of as belonging to 
the realm of masculine endeavor. A more even grad- 
ing with respect to interests, ideas, and motives is 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
likely to result when we separate girls and boys in 
grades or classes. 
Differences due to nationality—With America the 
“melting pot” of the nations it is not at all surprising 
to have the element of the foreign child enter into 
our problem. The unthinking teacher is quite likely 
to consider the foreign child as inferior to the American 
child. It is impossible here to go into the problem 
of Americanization. It is a serious problem and should 
be carefully studied by every teacher who has any 
number of foreign children in her classes. Foreign 
children should not be classed as dull merely because 
they do not measure up to the American sanitary code 
or because they do not speak the English language 
as we do. Teachers must be tolerant with the foreign 
child. They must be sympathetic. With no class 
of pupils will forbearance, love, and patience yield 
such large returns as with foreign children. The 
foreign child is not likely to remain in school so long 
as the American child, but that is all the more reason 
why we should give him the best possible education up 
to the point of his leaving the system. Regardless 
of where a pupil leaves our democratic school system 
he should be a better citizen because of his having 
attended school. Individual differences are practically 
the same with foreign children as with American, and 
fall in very much the same classes. Our problem with 
the foreign child is to devise ways and means of hold- 
ing him in school longer, so that society may benefit  
-P-A-G-E-29
      INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 19 
by the increased efficiency that comes through longer 
school periods. Certainly we do him an injustice to 
call him dull merely because he is a foreigner. 
Supervised study as an aid—One of the aids af- 
forded the teacher to note individual differences and 
to help her in solving the problems connected there- 
with is the excellent plan of supervised study, but 
whatever plan is used, essentially the same element 
is present regardless of how the plan is administered. 
Every type of supervised study includes the oppor- 
tunity of having the pupil study his lesson in school 
under the direction of the teacher to whom he will 
recite that lesson. Home study has been such an 
integral part of our school system that great opposi- 
tion is usually encountered from parents and teachers 
when a proposal is made to have the pupil do all of 
his work in school. To the parent it does not seem 
that his child is going to school if he does not bring 
home a number of books and have lessons to “get” 
for the next day. This is probably because the parent 
in his school days was accustomed to do that very 
thing. The teachers’ objection to the plan will likely 
be because the school day is lengthened. Supervised 
study will lengthen the school day; that cannot be 
contradicted. But when we investigate the plan and 
discover that all school work on the part of both 
teacher and pupil is finished in the school day at 
school, the plan is not so objectionable as appears at 
first glance.   
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  
20 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
A longer period, generally double the usual time, is 
required for supervised study. This is divided into 
two parts. During one part the lesson is recited and 
during the other the lesson for the next day is studied 
under the direction of the teacher. It is a question 
as to whether the recitation should complement the 
study period or vice versa. Personally the author be- 
lieves in the recitation period during the first half 
and the study period during the latter half of the 
division. There is a technique of the study period 
just as definite as there is of the recitation period, 
and it must be mastered by the teacher if the supervised 
study period is to be successful. 
Ordinarily our supervised study period works out 
in the following manner: the lesson for the day is 
taught in the usual manner; the assignment for the 
next day is given, but instead of taking this lesson 
home to study, the pupils begin immediately. At 
home, if a pupil fails to comprehend his lesson, he 
secures help from father or mother or older brother 
or sister. Such help often results in the problem 
being solved by a method different from that taught 
by the teacher. When such a pupil comes back to 
school and gives the solution, the teacher’s task is two- 
fold. First, she must assist the pupil to unlearn that 
which he has learned at home; second, she must teach 
him anew the correct process. With supervised study 
this is all changed. The pupil begins to study his les- 
son; he comes to a difficult part; he can ask the
-P-A-G-E-31
       INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 21 
teacher to help him, and she in turn will not just 
give him the information asked for, but will teach 
him the thing he needs to know at the time he needs 
to know it. There is no waste of time; the rest of 
the class are working according to their abilities, and 
the teacher is free to give individual attention to the 
pupils in her class. In the group many characteris- 
tics of children go by unnoticed; by the individual in- 
struction and help the teacher is able to give her at- 
tention to the individual, and his problems become her 
chief concern. 
Individual differences will be solved in many differ- 
ent ways. In one school system supervised study will 
solve the problem; in another school something else. 
Each teacher must experiment until she discovers for 
herself that which is of the most benefit in assisting 
her to know her class as individuals. Then we will 
have sympathetic, understanding teaching in our 
schools.

      CHAPTER III 
THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH 
SCHOOL 
The schools are for the most part not interested in 
the child until he becomes of school age. They have 
made no attempt to restrict his pre-school activities, 
even in the instance of the children of homes too poor 
to provide or permit of the normal play activity. This 
side of education—that is, pre-school age education— 
should very properly become the concern of all our 
schools if we hold to our democratic idea of the public 
schools—free schools for all children and equal educa- 
tional opportunity for all. A few attempts in this 
field have been made, but they remain attempts. There 
have been no solutions as yet, although several of the 
experiments in this field are promising enough to lead 
us to hope for results. 
The school is concerned chiefly with children of 
ages 6-16, and it is of these that we shall treat. 
THE PRIMARY PERIOD 
The background of the primary child—The child 
enters school at approximately age 6. His experience 
is limited, his environment may have been rich with 
23 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
stimulating materials, or it may have been utterly 
barren. His instinctive tendencies are very prominent. 
Coming into the atmosphere of the school, very often 
his first introduction to a group, he sees so many new 
things that he is bewildered. In the midst of his be- 
wilderment he finds the teacher, and in her he finds 
a friend. To him the person is all-important. His life 
thus far has been marked by attachment to people— 
father, mother, the members of the household, and 
now the teacher. The teacher thus represents the 
home, and the highest tribute a child can pay a teacher 
is when he forgets in the activity of the school and calls 
her “Mother.” 
Imitation—The child’s chief characteristic at this 
age is imitation. He imitates the teacher, he imitates 
his playmates, he imitates sounds and learns to read 
or sing, he imitates his classmates and raises his hand 
whether he knows the answer to the question proposed 
or not; his imitation is but a natural part of himself. 
The basis of instruction is naturally to use this im- 
pulse and to teach the child through imitation. The 
reasoning ability of the child is but slightly developed, 
but as much as the child has should undoubtedly be 
used. The child is social during this period and every 
effort should be put forth to develop his social ten- 
dencies. 
Social responsibilities—But this involves tremen- 
dous responsibilities. If we consider the social sig- 
nificance of the child during his primary period in
-P-A-G-E-35
THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 25 
school, we must also be aware of the social responsi- 
bilities the child is to assume. To this end imitation 
of correct manners, speech, and action are of im- 
portance. He must know how to assume the duties of 
host and his obligations as a guest. The introduction 
of activities involving these elements does much to 
secure this desirable result in the child. 
The approach to the mind of the child—The senses 
of the child are keen, awake, ready for those experiences 
that will later form the basis of his thinking, reasoning, 
and imagination. Bright colors appeal to him. The 
prade rooms are brightly decorated with colored pic- 
tures, paper. cut-outs, and the like. The books placed 
in his hands have beautifully colored pictures; the 
schoolroom itself is beautiful—or should be. The 
reaction of the child to all of this is the beginning of 
appreciation of environment. Through the medium 
of color there is brought to his attention those elements 
of life and environment that will form the basis of 
experience so needful in his study of subject matter. 
We cannot make our schoolrooms, especially those for 
primary children, too beautiful. The ugly, rigid desks 
and barren atmosphere of some schoolrooms is giving 
way to a tastily decorated room with movable seats 
so that the children may form groups of their own; 
floors covered with rugs; windows curtained; plants 
growing in the windows; a bird, perhaps an aquarium, 
and all that goes to make a well-ordered, livable room. 
There is no reason why the schoolroom should not be 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
as attractive, as lovely as the best of homes. Teacher 
and pupils under such circumstances find school en- 
joyable and the daily “task” becomes a pleasure. 
Value of music—The primary child is reached 
through music. Most children like to sing; all children 
can be taught to sing. The natural desire of the child 
to sing should be encouraged, developed, and by all 
means made prominent in the first years of the child’s 
school education. A piano in the classroom adds much 
to the possibilities of the teacher. Lacking that, a vic- 
trola with suitable records is the next best substitute. 
For teaching appreciation of music the victrola is un- 
excelled, because of the vast storehouse of music made 
instantly available in the classroom. Introducing the 
child to the best of music, music he can understand 
and appreciate, will help him all through life in a 
recognition of the worth while in music. 
Value of touch—By no means should we overlook 
the sensations of touch which are received through 
the child’s acquaintance with and intimate knowledge 
of materials in his environment. He must learn 
through actual experience that stone is hard, grass 
soft, tar sticky, and mud slippery. The greater the 
provision made for the child to investigate and handle 
and touch the sooner he will know and appreciate his 
environment and the world in which he lives. 
Plan of primary education—What then should be 
our plan of education in the primary grades? Our 
aim should be to develop children so that they will 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 27 
be able to take their place in society and not be found 
wanting. We cannot consider children as being “lit- 
tle men” or “little women”; they are not miniature 
adults; they have a life all their own, and it is our 
duty as teachers of small children to begin naturally 
the development of those characteristics that will be 
of service to the child when he grows up. This in- 
volves the following: Education in the primary grades 
should include the teaching of social and individual 
characteristics. Among these characteristics are, un- 
selfishness, fair play, truthfulness, honesty, courtesy, 
dependability, optimism, punctuality, and the like. 
Nor can these be taught by talking about them, read- 
ing about them, or discussing them. In the first place 
the teacher of the primary group ought to have these 
characteristics because of the inherent tendency of 
the child to imitate his teacher. If the teacher has 
these qualities it is certain that her pupils will get 
some of them through direct imitation; for example, 
courtesy. Again, projects, problems, and socialized 
groups involving the practice of these qualities will 
fix them in the minds of pupils in a way that no other 
method will. The fixation of ideals comes to us through 
experience with the elements of those ideals. 
Materials for primary grades—We have indicated 
that children of the primary period should become fa- 
miliar with the elements of their environment. This 
involves the use of these materials in the primary 
grades: hammers, saws, scissors, paste, boards, nails, 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
  
28 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
and all similar materials, the nature of which the child 
must learn through contact and experience. This does 
not mean the “busy work” of the past decade. We 
cannot say that much of that contributes to the child’s 
learning the substance and material of objects in his 
surroundings. We do mean that a varied experience 
with making of bird houses, modeling in clay, using the 
scissors and paste in making cut-outs must be definitely 
provided for if the child is to secure this essential 
part of his education. 
The place of school arts in the primary school— 
The school subjects of reading, writing, and number 
work are not to be slighted or omitted because of these 
other factors. Whereas in our older type of school, 
the school arts were the principal concern of the 
teacher, our modern school recognizes the fact that 
teaching primary children involves more than teaching 
the child to read, write his own name, and count up 
to one hundred. It is well enough to be able to do 
this, but society demands more. It demands personal 
attitudes and responses that the school must foster 
and teach. So it is a complex job, this teaching pri- 
mary children. The implications are many and only 
those teachers possessing the characteristics we wish 
children eventually to have as their own are likely to 
be successful in this field. A teacher who does not 
possess these personal qualities herself can scarcely be 
expected to teach them to children, nor can they be 
assumed for the occasion. The clear gaze of the pri-  
-P-A-G-E-39
THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 29 
mary child effectively penetrates the disguise—the 
teacher and her attributes must be real. 
This looks like an extensive program for the primary 
grades. Compared with the ideals of the old-time 
school, it is. The modern school, bringing to its aid 
the knowledge gained through an intimate study of the 
child and child life, finds it not impossible. For ex- 
ample, we recognize that the child is active, that he 
is curious, that he is interested in many things, and 
that this interest is not centered long on any one ob- 
ject. We utilize this by permitting him to be active. 
Only in the most formal of formal schools is the child 
required to sit in “position” with hands folded on the 
desk in front of him. Animals, dogs and cats for ex- 
ample, during the growing period need to stretch. So 
do growing children, and ample opportunity for them 
to exercise should be provided. A change of position, 
blackboard work, a game will give the desired activity. 
The use of curiosity—The child is curious; exces- 
sively so at times. There is no conscious thought on 
his part to interfere with affairs not his own, but any 
unfamiliar object furnishes him with the incentive to 
discover what it is, what it is made of, and what it is 
used for. At this period he loves to take a clock apart 
to discover what makes it work. He is a living ques- 
tion mark. “Why?” and “What?” are his most fre- 
quent questions. Now all of this can be turned to good 
account in teaching. His natural curiosity will lead 
him on to discover and learn many things that he 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  
30 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
might not otherwise learn. Curiosity, the keynote of 
the child’s life, will be found one of the most useful 
devices by the primary school-teacher. He will learn 
to read because he sees other people read and he is 
curious to know how himself. 
Interesting the child in school work—The interest 
of the child is fleeting. It cannot be fixed long on one 
subject. The recognition of this fact is found in the 
short periods of work in the lower grades. A period 
of ten minutes in the first grade will be found to be 
about as long a time as the interest of the child can 
be maintained on one subject. To secure the interest 
of the child and to make school interesting are im- 
portant, for when the work of the school is interesting 
to the child, he will learn more easily, and that which 
he has learned will remain longer with him. This is 
not a plea for “soft pedagogy.” The child should 
achieve difficult tasks, but only when his interest has 
aroused his effort to the point where he can see that 
such achievement will be to him worth while and not 
because the teacher in the réle of slave driver has set 
the tasks for him to perform under penalty of severe 
punishment for failure to do so. Here is where the 
teacher can be of the utmost assistance to her pupils. 
Interest can be aroused and the activities of the child 
guided toward desirable and worthy achievement. The 
child’s interest in snow can be easily aroused, and 
through this the function of the snow in serving as a 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 31 
blanket for shrubs, vines, and plants can be presented 
and impressed upon the mind of the child. The wise 
and skilful teacher will utilize a snowy day in winter 
when the children are active in playing in the snow to 
use the interest engendered to teach the facts noted 
above. A warm day in spring will bring no natural 
response to such a lesson. This example is obvious, 
but similar instances of the lack of foresight to utilize 
this characteristic of the child are frequent in the aver- 
age classroom. 
How to arouse interest—The arousal of curiosity, 
the development of interest can be stimulated by the 
school in two ways. One is to surround the child with 
stimulating materials. If his experience in school is 
merely with objects and materials with which he is 
perfectly familiar—those things he has seen day in 
and day out—he may be pardoned if school is to him 
a place to go because he must. On the other hand, if 
there are placed in his environment objects to see, 
touch, and use, and if there is constantly a change 
in these objects, he will go to school, not because he 
has to go, but because he feels he will miss something 
if he does not go. Teachers commonly make the mis- 
take of introducing the child at one time to all the 
materials available in the early part of the term, rather 
than keeping some of the materials for use later in the 
term. Even at the risk of having but one or two stimu- 
lating objects (supplementary readers, modeling clay, 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
    
32 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
paper cut-outs, etc.) at a time, a teacher should plan 
the use of the material so that at all times there will 
be something new available. 
Value of companionship—In the second place, it is 
the duty of the school to provide companions for the 
primary child. That is, if we wish the primary child 
to have the characteristic of companionability he must 
have the opportunity of working and playing with 
other children. Too often (very often in our modern 
life) the child comes from a home in which there are 
no brothers or sisters. He is an only child. He does 
not know how to work or play with other children, and 
obviously the only way he can learn is to afford him 
the opportunity. This means group activity both in 
the schoolroom and on the playground. Children who 
are members of large families do not need this pro- 
vision so much, but even here it is a common ex- 
perience to find children from these homes working 
and playing better with other children than with those 
of their own family. The personal attitude of unsel- 
fishness, tolerance, and sympathy result from this pro- 
vision, while the group ideals of fair play, codperation, 
and good will are sponsored. We cannot too strongly 
advocate incorporating provision for companionship 
in the primary grades. It is essential if we wish to 
foster the child’s tendency toward social efficiency. 
In his adult life he will be confronted with the situa- 
tion of meeting, living with, and working with others. 
The school in reflecting this life situation must defi-
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 33 
nitely provide for the child working and playing with 
his fellows. 
The use of collections—The child of the primary 
school enjoys making collections. The pocket of the 
average boy of six or seven will show this. Children 
will collect all sorts of things, stones, tags, pictures, 
colored papers, and a thousand and one things of value 
and interest only to the collector. The school may 
well utilize this collecting interest of the child in fur- 
thering his education. Inquiry as to available collec- 
tions brings us a wealth of material. In one school a 
collection of samples of the bark of trees in the vicinity 
of the school was made. These were arranged on a 
frame and underneath each sample of bark was a small 
sample of wood of the same tree. Thus a sample of 
maple bark would be matched with a sample of maple 
flooring hung directly beneath it. In another school 
collections of weed seeds, grains, and the like were 
made and stored in small pill bottles mounted on large 
sheets of cardboard for display. 
One effective collection that can easily be made is 
that of leaves. In the fall when the leaves are turning 
color the children enjoy gathering them. Such a col- 
lection becomes troublesome after a few days. The 
leaves become brittle and break. To preserve the leaf 
it is often dipped in melted paraffin. But even this 
becomes unsatisfactory and besides requires some skill 
to accomplish successfully. To remedy this and make 
the collection available for all, the following method
-P-A-G-E-44
  
34 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
may be utilized. Provide squares of white drawing 
paper of good quality and tubes of oil paints of various 
colors and a number of fine brushes. Carefully paint 
the surface of the leaf in its natural colors with the 
oil paints, using them sparingly. Then turn the leaf 
face down upon a square of drawing paper and care- 
fully smooth it out. Upon removal of the leaf an exact 
imprint in original colors will be the result. A group 
of such imprints can be tied together, forming a per- 
manent collection of leaves. 
Clothespin dolls dressed to represent children of 
various countries studied, a collection of flags or stamps 
of foreign countries are collections within the reach 
of the primary school. The guiding principle to be ob- 
served in making collections is to be sure the collection 
is of value educationally. There are undesirable col- 
lections which children sometimes make themselves, 
such as tobacco tags and pictures. The substitution 
of a more worth-while collection should result when- 
ever it is discovered that this is being done. 
Value of collections—Collections have value in that 
they encourage children to form the habit of order. 
This is perhaps one of the most difficult of habits for 
children to form, and permitting them to have some 
possessions of their own and keeping them in order 
will accomplish this. A collection that is not orderly 
is worthless, and the child recognizes the fact. The 
keeping of a collection will make for order, self-reliance, 
and dependability.

Qualifications of the primary teacher—And what 
shall we say of the teacher of the primary school? 
What qualifications and characteristics must she pos- 
sess to be successful? It is obvious that the primary 
teacher must possess those characteristics which we 
wish the child in the primary school to have. This 
involves unselfishness, courtesy, dependability, fair- 
ness, optimism, and the like. Above all does it involve 
patience. And not only patience, but boundless pa- 
tience. Next to having a real love for children, 
patience is the most desirable quality a primary teacher 
can have. Little tots do forget. There must be sym- 
pathy and understanding with child nature and a pa- 
tience that helps the child over difficulties and enables 
him to adjust himself to the world in which he finds 
himself. 
Some superintendents are of the opinion that the 
small statured teacher is the best for primary work. 
On the other hand, other superintendents complain 
that if teachers are too young looking, too small, they 
cannot be detected from the pupils. It would seem that 
age, stature, or size in themselves mean nothing so far 
as success or non-success in primary work is concerned. 
The primary teacher must be young at heart. Her hair 
may be gray, her years of service long, but her heart 
must beat in sympathy with the hopes and disappoint- 
ments of her pupils. 
Training of the primary teacher—Of the profes- 
sional training of primary teachers we shall say but 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
little. A two-year professional teacher training course 
should be the minimum. The work of the primary 
grades should be chosen deliberately by the prospective 
teacher who can work best with little children, actuated 
by a real love for them and not from any idea that the 
work required of the teacher in these grades is less 
exacting because it is the work of the beginning grades. 
The primary teacher should be fairly well skilled in 
music and art. Expertness is not demanded, but the 
ability to sing simple songs and to teach them and the 
skill of drawing and designing the thousand and one 
things (calendars, costumes, borders, dolls, etc.) used 
in the primary grades is undoubtedly necessary. 
Special qualifications ; dangers—Because of the imi- 
tative instinct being so strong a left-handed teacher 
should not attempt primary work, nor one who is de- 
formed in any way, be it ever so slight. Teaching a 
child to write or cut out designs with his right hand 
while you do it with your left may be found an insur- 
mountable task. The schoolroom and its equipment 
is planned for right-handed children—and the left- 
hander is at a distinct disadvantage, and we should 
be careful not to influence a child to use his left hand, 
a not improbable result if he imitates his teacher who 
is left-handed. 
THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL 
The intermediate school pupil is of ages 9-12. He 
is beginning to lose that characteristic of imitation,
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 37 
and he wants to do things for himself. The boy about 
this time has a desire to run away from home and join 
a circus or go West to shoot Indians or be a pirate. 
The girl is giving up her dolls, and toward the latter 
part of this period becomes rather romantic. The 
children in the intermediate school are undergoing a 
tremendous change; slowly they are putting away the 
toys of childhood and are taking on “grown-up” ideas. 
In other words, children of this period stand forth as 
individuals, distinct, separate, and anxious to show 
their ability as persons. 
Methods in use—Obviously the methods used in the 
primary school must be so altered as to fit the changed 
conditions met in the intermediate school. Those child 
characteristics which are individual are the most 
prominent during this period, and methods of instruc- 
tion must necessarily follow those personal ideals 
rather than the group ideals and attitudes. In many 
of our schools the methods used in these grades have 
been drill. Drill has its place and serves a very valu- 
able end, but drill should not be the exclusive method 
of grades four, five, and six. 
Fundamental principles of learning in intermediate 
grades—During the intermediate school period the 
child learns mainly through the responses and reactions 
he himself makes to the stimulating material of the 
classroom and also of his own environment. For this 
reason there should be plenty of opportunity for ac- 
tivity of the pupil in these grades. It is only as he, 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
for himself, looks up definitions, works problems, and 
discovers methods of work that he is being educated. 
Too much teacher help during this period will defeat 
the very purpose which it hopes to accomplish. 
Some children are slow workers; and while special 
individual drill lessons should be provided to correct 
this defect, still this type of pupil will be present in 
all grades in greater or lesser numbers. With such 
pupils the nervous, quick, and often unskilled teacher 
will have some difficulty. Don’t try to hurry. Be 
patient, take it easy, and give the pupil a chance to 
think. Don’t be afraid to wait until the pupil has 
had a chance to organize his knowledge in response 
to your question, but give him plenty of time. The 
result of hurrying him will be to develop the attitude 
that if he waits long enough he will not be obliged to 
answer the question, for the teacher will either call 
on someone else or answer it herself. However, there 
is a point at which patience ceases to be a virtue, and 
too long a wait should not be permitted because of 
the waste of time. How long the wait should be 
will be determined largely by experience; in any case 
it should not be longer than twenty seconds. 
Interest in adventure—The intermediate child is 
interested in adventure. This fact is of tremendous 
importance to the teacher of these grades. The boy’s 
interest in adventure, turned to stories of great men 
and great events, leads to the study of history. It may 
be utilized to introduce him to the best of literature.
-P-A-G-E-49
  
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 39 
At this age the boy becomes familiar with stories of 
the dime novel type. Recognizing this we can put in 
his hands such books as “Kidnapped” and “Treasure 
Island,” and while we are satisfying his love of adven- 
ture, at the same time we are providing him with a 
type of literature of great value in forming his literary 
tastes and habits. The boy who reads “Diamond 
Dick” behind his geography book is merely satisfying 
his longing to take part in stirring adventure, and be- 
cause of that should not be condemned by the teacher 
and punished. Rather turn that urge into worth-while 
stories of which there is such an abundant store. 
Utilizing the “movie”—We must not overlook the 
effect of the movies on this characteristic of children of 
this period. Attendance on movies is common and fre- 
quent. Frequently through school movies or those 
shown in the neighborhood theater there will be op- 
portunity for English themes, geography lessons, his- 
tory lessons, and citizenship lessons. That the moving 
picture is of value educationally we all will agree, but 
there is much chaff among the wheat and our problem 
is to develop habits and attitudes for the worth while. 
Supplementary materials—During the intermediate 
school period the use of supplementary materials plays 
an important part. By no means does this imply that 
the classroom must be well stocked with supplementary 
readers, magazines, and encyclopedias before such work 
can be undertaken. With a little thought the teacher 
can provide all the materials that can be used. For 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
example, if the class were making imaginary journeys 
to various parts of the United States, there are avail- 
able railroad folders, steamship guides, magazine ar- 
ticles culled from magazines the pupils find at home. 
A little bit of searching will bring to light much that 
can be used. The bed-time stories printed in our news- 
papers can be mounted on cardboard and used for 
supplementary reading. Many manufacturing con- 
cerns send out exhibits showing how their products 
are made. All these and more can be used for in- 
teresting lessons in many subjects. The teacher who 
says she has no material and is unable to secure any, 
simply is closing her eyes to that which is around her. 
No matter where she may be situated, it is available. 
While it is true that geographical readers and supple- 
mentary readers and maps and charts are fine, yet the 
lack of these ought not to deter any teacher from mak- ° 
ing the most of what can be found with a little effort. 
To the boy or girl who is given the problem of dis- 
covering where he can, in school or out, the information 
that will be of service to him in solving his problem, 
there will be an interest and a perseverance that simply 
cannot be obtained by application to the textbook 
alone. A chat with a Civil War veteran, for example, 
will make more real and vital that part of history than 
hours of study of facts as presented in the history 
books. 
Qualifications of the intermediate teacher—The 
teacher of the intermediate school needs fully as much
-P-A-G-E-51
          THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 41 
patience as the primary teacher. Children are often 
exasperating in their deliberateness during this age and 
grade period. The matter of discipline also becomes 
a factor, and the teacher of grades four, five, and 
six has a problem on her hands. It has been said that 
teachers who do not have the patience to work with 
little children and who cannot get along with the ado- 
lescent boy or girl will get along all right with inter- 
mediate school children. The teacher in these grades 
must understand what the child has been in the pri- 
mary grades and what he likely will be in the Junior 
High School in order to guide him during the “be- 
tween” period. Indeed, good intermediate teachers 
are scarce, and instead of putting unsuccessful or po- 
tentially unsuccessful teachers of the other grades in 
this division, we ought to carefully train teachers for 
these positions. 
The qualities chiefly demanded of intermediate 
school teachers are: first, an understanding of child 
nature, and second, a sympathy, patience, and op- 
timism that will recognize the individuality of the child 
and permit it to develop. We need strong teachers— 
strong in the sense that makes the pupil realize that 
education is serious and the chief business of the child, 
and at the same time surround school with interesting 
activities so that the child learns through the effort he 
makes.
-P-A-G-E-52
    
42 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
The Junior High School Period 
The Junior High School is a grouping of grades seven, 
eight, and nine, thus forming an educational unit in 
which the child, through departmental teaching, selec- 
tion of subjects, pre-vocational training, and promotion 
by subject, shall have the opportunity to explore in 
order to discover his major interests and aptitudes. 
The junior high school is a recent development. We 
have recognized that at the age of twelve the child 
enters the adolescent period. During this time tre- 
mendous changes take place. His body grows rapidly; 
many of his organs, the heart for example, double in 
size. He becomes awkward. He turns from the in- 
dividual of intermediate school days and again desires 
to meet members of his own age in a social group. 
But he is clumsy, his hands are so big, he stumbles over 
his own feet, and his voice is changing. The boy and 
girl at this period are most unlovely. Until recent 
times the school has made little or no provision for this 
period of change. He still pursued the same subjects 
he had in the lower grades. It is true they were more 
“advanced,” but they still were history, geography, 
English, ete., and he was heartily sick of them all. 
Organization of the junior high school—The or- 
ganization of the junior high school varies in different 
sections to meet existing needs. The true junior high 
school is organized on what is known as the 6-3-3 plan.
-P-A-G-E-53
         THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 43 
That is, six years are devoted to elementary school 
work, three to junior high, and three to senior high. 
Variations of this are the 6-2-4 plan, the 6-6 plan, and 
many others. The 6-3-3 plan, however, is the real 
junior high school plan; the others are largely make- 
shifts. Thus some superintendents claim to have a 
junior high school, when as a matter of fact they have 
departmental teaching in grades seven and eight and 
are organized on a 6-2-4 basis. 
The junior high school as a bridge—The junior high 
school serves as a bridge over the gap existing be- 
tween the elementary and the high school. The elimi- 
nation from school at the end of the eighth grade is 
appalling. Large numbers drop out at this time. Nor 
is the reason entirely that of economic pressure. In- 
vestigation of such dropping out reveals that students 
have left school because they “hated school,” “thought 
the teacher had a grudge against them,” “got in with 
a gang that thought school was no good,” and for 
similar reasons. Only a small percentage left because 
they were obliged to go to work. The indictment is 
squarely against the school system—it was not vital 
enough to hold boys and girls to their educational tasks. 
With the attendance law compelling attendance, pupils 
left as soon as the restrictions were removed. 
To a large extent the junior high school has elimi- 
nated many of the withdrawals. We shall discover 
shortly by what methods, but for the moment we shall 
merely state the fact. If the junior high school has
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
done nothing more than that it has been worth while, 
and it has—a great deal more. It is the first attempt 
to build a school around the known qualities and 
characteristics of the child at the adolescent stage. It 
is therefore a school for the child and not the conform- 
ing of the child to the school. 
Exploration of courses—The organization of the 
junior high school provides definitely for the explora- 
tion of courses in order that the child may have the 
opportunity to discover his interests and aptitudes. In 
many junior high schools this is done by means of a 
series of short unit courses of six weeks each, perhaps 
in such “subjects” as printing, auto repairing, car- 
pentry, mechanical drawing and blue printing, tinning, 
and plumbing. Many a boy will “find” himself in this 
pre-vocational taste of a trade. Again in the academic 
subjects the pupil has the opportunity to explore in 
order to discover his interests. The same opportunity 
is offered to the girl. As a result the life-work of the 
individual-is the result of trial plus definite guidance 
from a teacher or director charged with such duties. 
The boy then does not enter a trade or business because 
his father is in that trade, but because he has selected 
it as appealing to his interest and skill. Usually he 
finds also the need for a good education in those sub- 
jects contributing to success in his chosen occupation. 
The junior high school provides also the academic 
course of study leading to professional courses in college 
and university as well as this pre-vocational training 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 45 
for trades. We use the term “pre-vocational” ad- 
visedly. The junior high school does not pretend to 
turn out a finished mechanic, printer, or plumber. It 
merely gives the boy or girl an insight into the work 
to be done in these various occupations and permits 
him to do some of it, but it does not provide vocational 
training in the sense of giving a completed education 
in any field of vocational endeavor. Pre-vocational, 
on the other hand, expresses the “before training” the 
child gets which acquaints him with the occupation 
and permits him to enter upon it with some knowledge 
of its limitations and possibilities and the skill de- 
manded for success. 
The place of the junior high school in American 
education—The junior high school fills a definite place 
in the scheme of education. The adolescent boy and 
girl, confronted by a multitude of conflicting ideas, 
is often bewildered. His social tendencies are pro- 
nounced and there is the desire to be with his com- 
panions. During the intermediate school period he 
had no use for the girls—they were tolerated but were 
a nuisance. Now he seeks their company. And this is 
as it should be. It is normal and natural that boys 
and girls of this age should desire to be together, and 
the school has a wonderful opportunity to provide the 
means. In working out lessons in geography, civics, 
history, and the like, excursions to places of interest 
or natural phenomena, such as rivers, mountains, 
woods, give the teacher an opportunity to bring boys 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    
46 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
and girls together naturally and without self-conscious- 
ness. There should be plenty of opportunity of this 
type and also of the semi-formal type—school parties, 
entertainments, plays, so that the boy may grow up 
with a fine regard for womanhood and the girl with 
a respect for manhood. Just as soon as we say to 
young people of this period that they must not be to- 
gether, they will be. It is far better to plan for op- 
portunities of a social nature where boys and girls 
can meet under proper supervision than to leave them 
to their own devices. 
Separation of the sexes—In some junior high 
schools provision is made in the organization for sepa- 
rate classes for boys and girls. There seems to be a 
distinct advantage in having boys and girls together in 
classes and in study rooms that far outweighs any 
argument for separation. Again, it is merely the fact 
that together there is opportunity for natural relation- 
ships to be fostered which simply are not secured when 
boys and girl have their own classes and study rooms. 
Characteristics of the junior high school—There 
are many features of the junior high school that have 
usually been reserved only for senior high school stu- 
dents. Among them we find departmental teaching 
and its corollary promotion by subject, elective pro- 
gram of studies, homogeneous grouping, and many 
others. It is not our purpose to discuss all of these. 
Departmental teaching being the common feature of 
the junior high school it might be wise to consider
-P-A-G-E-57
         THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 47 
it in its various aspects. Normally, departmental teach- 
ing means one teacher to a subject with a change of 
classes each period. Sometimes a teacher teaches two 
or more subjects to a change of classes. This plan of 
procedure distributes the influence of a strong teacher 
over a larger group than if she were teaching all sub- 
jects to one grade, and also minimizes the effect of a 
weak teacher. It makes possible the expert in subject 
matter. A teacher who teaches one or two subjects 
is likely teaching subjects of her major interest and 
therefore has the inclination and opportunity to de- 
velop lessons that will grip the attention of her pupils. 
The corollary of departmental teaching, promotion 
by subject, is a wise provision for junior high school 
organization. It seems unwarranted and unmerited to 
compel a pupil to take the work of an entire grade over 
again merely because he has failed in one or two sub- 
jects. We have known of pupils repeating the work 
of the entire eighth grade because they failed in spell- 
ing and writing. Not that spelling and writing are 
unimportant subjects, but it is ridiculous to take 
arithmetic, English, and history over again because 
of failure in the aforementioned subjects. To carry 
this to its logical conclusion we ought to have depart- 
mental teaching in all grades of school, not merely in 
the junior high school. Indeed, many of our progres- 
sive schools are doing this very thing. 
The junior high as a school for adolescents—The 
junior high, then, established to meet the needs of 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
adolescent boys and girls, should include all such in 
our school system. Any boy or girl twelve years of 
age, regardless of what grade he may be in, should be 
immediately transferred to the junior high school un- 
less he is retarded because of illness or lack of educa- 
tional opportunity. The mentally deficient child of 
this age in grades one or two or three will find work 
better suited to his needs than in the conventional 
classroom. The feeble minded can be taught to work 
with his hands, and the shop opportunities in the 
junior high school may be the agency to show him 
the way to social independence. Another element 
enters here. He is physically of the adolescent age 
and should associate with others of the same physical 
age rather than with those of younger ages. Of course 
if such a plan is followed these mentally deficient 
children should be in a separate class with a teacher 
skilled in teaching pupils of this type. 
Supervised study in the junior high school—There 
is likely to be in junior high school, as well as in any 
type of school, some pupils who will need special help 
to keep up with their classes. Supervised study—a 
feature of most junior high schools—will help a con- 
siderable number, but there will be others who for 
various reasons—illness, sickness in the family, and 
the like—will fall behind their classes. The special 
teacher will be found of greatest assistance in these 
cases. This special teacher-tutor will have sent to 
her from the regular classroom teachers those pupils
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 49 
who for any reason have fallen behind their classes. 
She will provide extra study periods, during which 
time she will help these pupils make up the work 
missed. In systems in which this special teacher is not 
provided, this work must of necessity fall upon the 
classroom teacher. 
Character habits—The habits of character which 
were in the process of formation in the lower grades 
should also receive attention. The concrete ideas 
of unselfishness, fair play, courtesy, and the like are 
still emphasized, but now is the time to introduce 
the child to the abstract ideas of altruism, tolerance, 
and optimism. These desirable qualities may form 
the theme for discussion in connection with the work 
in almost any subject, but ought not to be neglected 
or omitted. 
Qualifications of the junior high school teacher— 
The junior high school movement, as a rather recent 
development, has not been in existence long enough 
to set up uniform standards of training for its teaching 
staff. The usual procedure in any city establishing 
junior high schools has been to select the outstanding 
successful teachers in the grades and establish them in 
junior high school positions. In Rochester, New York, 
which, by the way, has a most wonderful and remark- 
able development of junior high schools under the 
able direction of Dr. Herbert Weet, a similar process 
was used with the provision that any successful grade 
teacher might apply for a junior high school position 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  
50 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
and then attend an intensive school of a few weeks’ 
duration for junior high school teachers. This had the 
advantage of at least preparing teachers for conditions 
they were likely to meet. Our colleges and normal 
schools are beginning to awake to the situation and are 
offering specialized courses for teachers in the junior 
high school. 
A perusal of these courses shows a wide diversity of 
subject matter, but in one respect they are a unit. 
All provide for thorough training in the understanding 
of adolescence. It is right that this is so, for an un- 
derstanding of child nature and psychology at this 
important stage of his development is essential to 
successful teaching in junior high schools. Subject 
matter is important, for the teacher is now specializing 
in one or two subjects, and she needs to be well 
grounded in her specialty. Discipline is an important 
factor, for the child is changeable—one day docile and 
the next a barbarian. But paramount in the qualifi- 
cations of a junior high school teacher stands a knowl- 
edge of adolescence. 
Our junior high school teacher needs to be sympa- 
thetic, sympathetic in a different way from the primary 
teacher. During this period the pupil is seriously ex- 
ploring, reaching out to discover his interests and 
aptitudes, and he needs a sympathetic listener to whom 
he can pour out his longings. The sympathetic junior 
high school teacher can do much to assist the pupil 
in separating the immediate and attractive but short- 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 51 
lived interest from that which may be more remote 
but substantial. 
Coupled with this sympathy is the guidance of 
pupils in a vocational way. In many of our larger 
schools this duty is centered in one individual who 
does no teaching but acts as the counselor of all the 
pupils with respect to vocational choice. In a sense 
this is unfortunate. The teacher is apt to be in more 
intimate contact with the pupil and the pupil in turn 
is more apt to confide in the teacher whom he knows 
more intimately. The teacher is the logical person in 
whose hands the guidance, vocationally, of the student 
should be placed. Only when our units are too large 
for convenient handling and where such a task adds 
greatly to the burden of the teacher should resort be 
had in a special vocational adviser. This is assuming, 
of course, that our junior high school teachers have 
been trained in the principles underlying such 
guidance. 
The junior high school teacher, as one superinten- 
dent has expressed it, “should have no nerves, but have 
plenty of nerve.’ This means the characteristic of 
experimentation, of being firm and fair in discipline 
and the realization that adolescent boys and girls need 
to be dealt with in a way different from their brothers 
and sisters in the intermediate school. The teacher 
who is easily discouraged and disappointed, who does 
not have perseverance, will never be a successful junior 
high school teacher. 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
  52 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
Current tendency—The tendency of most school 
superintendents is to demand a college graduate for 
a teacher in these grades. This is frankly because 
the college graduate is better grounded in subject 
matter than a normal school graduate. In order for 
normal school graduates to compete with college gradu- 
ates at least three years of professional training should 
be offered. Many normal schools are doing this. A 
four-year specialized course for teachers of junior high 
school subjects in a teacher training institution ought 
to be the minimum academic requirement for all. 
THE RURAL SCHOOL 
One who has never attended rural school either as a 
pupil or teacher has missed a wonderful experience. 
Teacher and pupil in a one-room rural school will get 
down to basic fundamentals sooner than in any other 
division of our public schools. There is more real sac- 
rifice, more hard work, more joy in accomplishment in 
a rural school than anywhere else. Taught by inex- 
perienced teachers for the most part, working on a 
pitifully meager salary, without adequate equipment 
or supplies, the rural school is “carrying on.” We 
eulogize the little red schoolhouse without stopping to 
think that its illustrious products—statesmen, clergy- 
men, bankers, editors, ete.—would probably have been 
just as illustrious had they attended a graded school 
or no school at all. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63

Rural school conditions—Rural school conditions 
in many sections of the country are far from ideal. 
The physical condition of most of them is frightful. 
The old-time rural school appears like a box car with 
a small steeple on one end. It contains one room with 
windows on three sides. It was built around 1870 and 
perhaps has been painted once since. The desks are 
much whittled and are non-adjustable There is a 
desk and chair for the teacher, a few books, a rusty 
stove, and a blackboard. The playground is bare of 
trees and the yard surrounding the school is a veritable 
sea of mud in wet weather. In the midst of such sur- 
roundings and with antiquated equipment the teacher 
is expected to turn out a product that will compare 
favorably with the city school product. 
The country child is entitled to educational ad- 
vantages comparable to those afforded the city child 
—A little thought on the subject will canvince one 
that there is no reason why the boy or girl born in 
the country should not have as good an education as 
the boy or girl who is born in the city. Why should 
we penalize the country boy and girl? Why should 
we throw a handicap in their way? The slogan of 
education reform in rural communities should be 
“Equal Educational Opportunity For All.” It is gen- 
erally admitted that our rural schools are poorly taught 
and poorly equipped, but in spite of this admission 
comparatively little is done to improve them. It is 
true that we find gratifying exceptions to this. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
54 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
Western States, less bound by tradition than the Hast, 
are pushing consolidation as the remedy. The State 
of Pennsylvania is doing much in the same way. New 
Jersey through an excellent supervision provision does 
much for its rural schools. But in spite of all measures 
which may be taken there will always be the necessity 
for the one-room rural school. There will be sparsely 
settled sections in which the one-room school will fit 
the need of the community, and so we will always have 
our problem with us. 
The basis for the solution of the rural school prob- 
lem—To understand better the rural school problem 
we must turn our attention to rural conditions and find 
in these conditions the elements that will lead to the 
solution of our school problem. It needs but a glance 
to tell us of improved conditions in farming. We use 
the self-binder, the mowing machine, the tractor, the 
hay loader, the manure spreader, in place of the ox- 
team, the scythe, the cradle, the tying of grain sheaves 
by hand. The farmer has kept abreast of the times 
with respect to farm machinery. He has modern equip- 
ment with which to work his farm. 
In the home, modern conditions do not prevail to 
the extent that they do on the farm. There are count- 
less numbers of farm homes that boast a tractor but 
do not have running water in the kitchen. The aver- 
age farm kitchen, so far as convenience is concerned, 
is very similar to the farm kitchen of fifty years ago. 
While the farmer uses modern equipment on the farm,
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 55 
the farmer’s wife puts up with inconveniences her hus- 
band would not tolerate. Even in the farm home most 
modernized it is hardly so modern as farm methods. 
In other words, the farm home has not kept pace with 
farming improvements. 
When we compare the progress of the rural school 
with the farm and the farm home we are again as- 
tonished. We have indicated a lack of improvement, 
of old equipment, and inadequate provision for modern 
teaching methods. The average rural school shows 
but little progress and the best of the rural schools 
but little enough. 
To indicate graphically the comparative progressive- 
ness of the farm, farm home, and rural school the 
following will be of value.

Increased cost of rural school education—To pro- 
vide properly for educational opportunity in the rural 
districts it will be necessary to spend much more money 
than at the present time. As soon as you touch the 
taxpayer’s pocketbook, you touch him in a vulnerable 
spot. He willingly pays ten cents for a loaf of bread 
that formerly cost five; he spends thirty-five cents 
for a fifteen-cent magazine, while a five-cent cigar 
exists in name only. He pays double for his amuse- 
ments, pleasures, and necessities, and because he fre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
    56 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
quently is called upon to expend money for these 
things he has become accustomed to their price. But 
once double his taxes! If he spent twice as much 
for the education of his children as was spent on his 
education, he would be giving his children an education 
admittedly inadequate and in no sense meeting the 
changed conditions of modern life. And when we 
consider that in many of our rural districts taxes for 
school purposes are far from being double those of 
thirty years ago (to make them so would cause a riot), 
we can really see one of the big reasons for the non- 
advancement of the rural school. No, more money 
must be spent in rural school districts and it must 
be expended wisely in order that the rural boy and 
girl may have as good an educational opportunity as 
the city boy and girl. 
This does not imply the same type of education as 
the city child receives. Education must adapt itself 
to rural conditions and rural needs and fit the rural 
child for his place in society. The best way to under- 
stand just what a program this involves is to analyze 
rural conditions and needs and then fit the school pro- 
gram to meet these needs. 
Advantage of city life—We often hear the expres- 
sion of opinion that the country is the place to bring 
up children; that in the country there is an abundance 
of fresh air, food, and plenty of exercise. We deluded 
ourselves with the fancy that this was true until we 
came to a rude awakening. The war which brought
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 57 
many factors to our attention showed us that in com- 
parison with the city boy, the country boy was a 
poor second in general physical condition Why? The 
city boy is surrounded by health regulations; he has 
been taught the value of health. The city provides 
for the collection of garbage, disposal of sewage, 
quarantine for contagious disease. City-wide measures 
are taken to prevent breeding of flies and mosquitoes. 
In the country we are but slowly awaking to the menace 
of the garbage pile, and pools of stagnant water, and 
the necessity for plenty of fresh air in sleeping rooms. 
There still persists in the country the notion that night 
air is poisonous. 
Use of rural life situations in the school—The rural 
school teaches physiology and hygiene. Instead of 
the usual textbook method of instruction, the learning 
of facts and not connecting them with every-day life, 
how much more profitable it would be if some topic, 
such as the breeding of flies or mosquitoes, was dis- 
cussed and actual practical work in the prevention of 
such breeding undertaken. The boy who covers a pool 
of stagnant water with a coating of oil will learn more 
about mosquitoes than he could possibly learn through 
textbooks, and it will remain with him longer, to say 
nothing of the benefit to society as the result of his 
act. 
The country is full of such opportunities. A small 
Babcock milk tester will furnish hundreds of arithmetic 
problems—and also tell the farmer the truth about his 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
cows. The germination of seeds and testing of seeds 
for percentage of germination afford wonderful op- 
portunities for lessons in many of the school arts. The 
subject of balanced meals, proper foods, and the neces- 
sity for certain kinds can be taught through the school 
lunch. Every rural school ought to have provision for 
serving something warm at noon. Every rural boy who 
has carried his lunch and eaten frozen pie will ap- 
preciate the force of that statement. It is a simple 
matter to provide for serving warm milk, soup, or 
cocoa at noon. And many are the lessons to be taught 
in this manner. 
Play and the rural pupil—Pupils of rural schools 
too often do not know how to play or what to play 
when they are sent on the playground for recess. Every 
pupil should be sent out-doors. Simple homemade 
equipment, see-saws, swings, and the like will furnish 
an incentive. Certainly the rural schoolteacher needs 
to get out on the playground with her pupils. She 
should have at her command knowledge of games to 
be played and activities that can be carried out in 
small and large groups. By no means should she domi- 
nate the playground. This is the children’s hour. Let 
them decide what to play; the teacher is merely a 
guide, an adviser. She need not go on the playground 
every day, but certainly she should make it her busi- 
ness to supervise this part of the child’s education as 
well as that which he receives within the four walls of 
the school building. This is the teacher’s opportunity
-P-A-G-E-69
         THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 59 
to fix those desirable habits of fair play, team work, 
courtesy, and good sportsmanship. 
Teaching the rural pupil to appreciate rural en- 
vironment—Rural homes and rural schoolhouses are 
for the most part unattractive. And they can be most 
attractive. What better opportunity affords to teach 
the child the love for the beautiful than in this situa- 
tion? Cleaning up the school yard, planting flower 
seeds, bulbs, and trees, building bird houses, decorating 
the schoolroom according to the season of the year, 
give the opportunity for the development of this 
side of the child. The life of a rural child can be drab 
and dull if he is not taught to see the beauty in nature 
about him. It is worth while to talk to him about the 
sunsets and stars and forests and rivers. The poetry 
and beauty of his environment can be made an open 
book, and he will read it with avidity if only the sesame 
be placed in his hands. 
Changing rural social conditions—In the days now 
past the social life of the rural sections was replete 
with visitings, sociables, and the like. Families traveled 
long distances with oxen or horse and wagon to visit 
each other and swap news. There was a solidarity 
about it all that made it remarkable; no sham, no 
show, just plain, honest worth. Today with the tele- 
phone, the automobile, the improved highways, the 
movies, the radio, this is largely changed. The farm 
folk may go forty or fifty miles for their amusement 
after the day’s work is done. Visiting can be done
-P-A-G-E-70

60 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
over the telephone with half the countryside listening 
in. Neighborhood life is greatly changed, and the 
influence of modern convenience is reflected in rural 
life. 
The rural school as a community center—The rural 
school can and should be the common center around 
which the community activities of the district can re- 
volve. Open the doors of the school to entertainments, 
socials, lectures, parent-teachers’ meetings. Here is 
common ground belonging to all, where all individuals 
may meet as equals. The rural school can be the 
community house of the country, and as such can do 
much to help the rural community find the best that 
is in life. 
A modern readjustment of rural education—To 
do all this and more—for we have merely indicated the 
extent of the possibilities—there is need for a modern 
readjustment of rural education. A properly qualified 
teacher (and we shall attempt to describe her later) 
will help, but more than that, the physical equipment 
must be of a type fitted for country life. An ideal 
rural school would be of cottage style attractively 
situated in an accessible location so that no pupil 
would be obliged to walk more than two miles or ride 
more than one hour. The grounds would be at least 
two acres in extent, providing for playground space, 
and also for attractive trees, shrubs, flower spots, and 
vines. The school room would contain all modern 
conveniences, adjustable, movable seats, a library, coat
-P-A-G-E-71
         THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 61 
rooms, window boxes, adequate heating and ventilat- 
ing systems, curtains at the windows, in short, an 
attractive room that makes its appeal to the child at 
once because of its evidences of refinement. Nor is 
this an impossible program for a rural community. 
It means an increased expenditure for education, but 
it also means an increased return to the community. 
Qualifications of the rural schoolteacher—The 
teacher in our ideal rural school will have at least two 
years of professional training after high school gradua- 
tion. The chief qualifications will be a love for country 
life and a sympathy with rural conditions. She will 
make the community her home and contribute to its 
welfare by active participation in the affairs of the 
community. She must be a good mixer, able to get 
along with people of all types. There will be criticism, 
of course. When a teacher is not criticized there is 
something wrong with the teacher. Our ideal teacher 
will meet each criticism with tact and courtesy, and 
so far as possible show to the individuals concerned or 
the community as a whole that her plan of procedure 
is sound educationally. By taking the public into her 
confidence much unpleasantness will be avoided. 
Why rural teachers change so frequently—At 
present the rural schools are not attracting the best 
teachers. It is common practice for the teacher to 
remain in one school but a year, moving on when the 
next school year comes. You cannot expect any teacher 
to remain in a school unless she can have the support
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
of the community, and together with it make an effort 
for progressive education. The practice in some sec- 
tions to engage a teacher and then to handicap her 
with unwarranted criticism, meager supplies, worn-out 
equipment, gossip because “she does not do like the 
teacher we had last year,” cannot be too sharply con- 
demned. The writer once “sat in” on a meeting of 
school directors who debated buying a dictionary for 
the school on the request of the teacher and who de- 
cided in the negative on the ground that it wasn’t 
needed—“‘the teacher last year had n’t asked for one, 
and she kept a good school.” The teacher in the rural 
school should be accorded all possible chance and op- 
portunity to give the children of the community an 
education, and there seems to be no excuse for such 
parsimony. 
Ideals of rural teaching—The reason why it is pos- 
sible to affirm positively that ideal conditions will 
produce desirable results is because we have evidence 
in those schools which approach the ideal. There are 
many beautiful rural schools in the midst of wonderful 
surroundings, presided over by well-qualified teachers 
who have carried out ideals of community endeavor 
and who have adopted the school curriculum to meet 
rural conditions. These teachers have remained in the 
same school for a number of years. Some states have 
provided teacherages similar to the parsonage, where 
teachers may find comfortable and desirable living 
quarters. Such endeavors make us hopeful that the
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE PUPIL AND HIS PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL 63 
rural school will eventually come into its own. Just 
now we need teachers who have a vision of service to 
go into these schools to raise their educational stand- 
ards. We must raise the requirements for a teaching 
certificate to teach in these schools or we are going 
to continue having inefficiently taught rural schools. 
The salary schedule must be made attractive to induce 
our teachers in training to serve in the rural school. 
When we begin to demand these we will obtain them. 
The situation is favorable and with courage we must 
press on and secure for the country boy and girl that 
which his city cousin has long enjoyed.

CHAPTER IV 
TYPES OF TEACHING 
The actual teaching of a class may appear to an 
observer to be a surprisingly simple procedure. The 
teacher stands before the class with the textbook open 
in her hand while the pupils have theirs closed. From 
the open text the teacher esks questions and calls upon 
a pupil to recite. The good recitation she commends; 
the poor one she scolds over. But mark, this is not 
teaching; this is merely “lesson-hearing,” and while 
we find plenty of it in our schools today the well- 
trained teacher conducts her class in a much different 
way. Lessons are planned as carefully as a general 
decides upon a plan of battle; individual weaknesses 
and strength are noted and provision for them made. 
The possible methods available for the subject and 
materials taught are considered and the best selected. 
It is our purpose to discuss the types of teaching most 
commonly used in our schools at the present time 
and to point out their desirability for different lessons. 
THE INDUCTIVE METHOD 
The inductive lesson belongs to the formal type of 
teaching. It follows the five steps of the Herbartians, 
67 
   
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
namely: Preparation, Presentation, Comparison and 
Abstraction, Generalization, Application. 
Preparation—The step of preparation gives the 
pupil the aim of the lesson and, arousing his interest 
in its solution, makes the problem vital. This step 
should build upon the foundation of the past experi- 
ence of the child. This is one reason why it is so 
essential that the child should have such a wide and 
varied experience in the primary grades. Out of this 
mass of experience the teacher will assist the child 
to bring to mind those elements that will be of assist- 
ance in the solution of his problem. It is inevitable 
that some extraneous material will be brought as well. 
This, however, will be taken care of at a later period 
and need not hinder in the development of the lesson. 
We may compare this step to that of preparing the 
soil for seed; the child is prepared by gathering from 
his experience those elements with which he is familiar 
to solve a problem which is unfamiliar to him. 
Presentation—Presentation utilizes past experience. 
With the problem stated, the child is encouraged to 
contribute to its solution by presenting such data from 
his past experience as may be of value. The amount, 
as well as the quality of such data, will vary. Each 
individual will have had a different past experience. 
With some it may have been meager, with others it 
may have been extensive. In case the problem in- 
volves elements with which the child has had no ex- 
perience, it is wise for the teacher to supply the 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
TYPES OF TEACHING 69 
necessary experience if possible. In this way the child 
will understand and appreciate the factors entering 
into the solution of the problem. 
This experience should be real, vital, and interest- 
ing. In many cases it can be found in the form of 
an excursion actually to see certain processes or forms. 
It may be that the experience can be gained through 
pictures, diagrams, or similar types of visual instruc- 
tion. The sand table may be utilized, or clay for 
modeling. This period of the lesson should very 
definitely weigh the evidence presented as a possible 
solution to the problem in hand. It is the work of 
the teacher to direct, stimulate recall, and to help 
pupils organize their knowledge in an attempt to solve 
the problem. For this reason it is wise to restate the 
problem ‘from time to time or to emphasize the aim 
of the lesson so that the pupil will not go far afield 
in his endeavors, but will be kept within rather narrow 
bounds of thinking. 
Comparison and abstraction; formulating the 
generalization—Comparison and abstraction mean 
the comparison of the elements secured and organized 
in the previous steps with the idea of abstracting those 
which apply directly to the problem and eliminating 
all others. Care should be taken in the comparison 
of major elements. That is, if the problem of the 
lesson deals with the climate of two sections of the 
country, we must compare climate with climate and’ 
not with any other characteristic. The reasoning and 
    
¢
-P-A-G-E-80
  70 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
thinking process is involved in this section of work, 
and it is important that the pupil be trained in those 
habits of thought that will develop into correct reason- 
ing and thought. So the result of our comparison and 
abstraction is that we draw off those elements that 
enable us to form a generalization. 
Generalization—A generalization may be the rule, 
a definition, a principle, or a formula. The object in 
securing a generalization is to obtain a method that 
will solve all similar problems containing the same 
elements as the one solved. This, of course, demands 
a general rule, a general principle, or general formula; 
rules, principles, and formule which will solve all 
problems and not special types or cases. It is of the 
utmost importance to bring the child’s attention to 
this, for a special rule for a special case defeats the 
purpose of this type of lesson. 
Application—Having obtained a generalization is 
comparable to securing a good straight nail and driv- 
ing it into a bit of wood. It may stay there, but at 
any time it can easily be withdrawn. So a generaliza- 
tion by itself, even though committed to memory, is 
of little value unless some application of it is made. 
The application is comparable to clinching the nail. 
It fastens it firmly in the wood. The application con- 
firms the generalization in the mind of the child. Just 
as he learns to do by doing, so he fixes rules, 
principles, and definitions by applying them to con- 
crete situations.   
-P-A-G-E-81
ee ee ee 
TYPES OF TEACHING 71 
This application can be made in several ways. The 
teacher may merely assign a series of problems involv- 
ing the generalization developed. These may be “the 
next ten” in the book. Or she may present real, live 
vital problems concerning the pupils’ environment 
that depend upon the generalization for their solu- 
tion. Again, she may ask the class to contribute 
problems involving the elements studied, and from 
the list submitted select a number to be solved by the 
class. This involves time and to many teachers will 
appear to be more troublesome than assigning work 
from the text. It is true, it will take more time and 
the results at first will be very disappointing, but it 
should be continued until the class can present a 
creditable series of problems. By doing this we are 
enlisting pupil activity in the process of education, and 
any such activity will do far more toward educating 
him than any other plan. 
Cautions—There are numerous cautions to be ob- 
served in the use of the inductive lesson. It is not 
intended as an exclusive method. Not all lessons lend 
themselves to the inductive method, and the fact that 
the inductive lesson is likely to be formal in the hands 
of many teachers makes it undesirable from that 
standpoint. In its place it is very effective, but it is 
not a bow for every teacher to use. Especially is it 
difficult to use if the child is deficient in experience, 
for then, not having a foundation on which to build, 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
    72 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
the teacher must spend most of her time supplying 
the deficiency. 
THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD 
The second of the formal types of teaching is to be 
found in the deductive method. In a sense deduction 
is the reverse of induction, for whereas induction ends 
with a generalization, deduction requires a generaliza- 
tion at the beginning of the process. The formal steps 
of deduction are: (1) Statement of the Problem, 
(2) Generalization, (3) Inference, and (4) Verification. 
Statement of the problem—The statement of the 
problem is necessary to start the thought process. 
This problem should be real, vital, and contain a life 
situation. It should conform to the age and grade 
of the child. The problem should excite a desire to 
solve it, and in the lower grades the element of 
curiosity may very well enter into the question pro- 
posed. For best results a simple problem simply stated 
is best. Thus “How are lead pencils made?” is a much 
better problem than “Discover the various elements 
that enter into the manufacture of lead pencils, and 
show how each is produced and finally are made into 
the finished product.” 
Generalization—A generalization—a rule, defini- 
tion, or principle—will be recalled as a solution to a 
problem. Two or more generalizations may be re- 
called. In either case we need the next step to decide 
which one should be used.
-P-A-G-E-83
  TYPES OF TEACHING 73 
Inference—Inference is merely inferring that a gen- 
eralization will fit the problem, and it may take some 
trial and error process before we arrive at the one 
which will fit. 
Verification—The process of trying and the securing 
of the successful generalization is verification. Verifi- 
cation is always made in application of a generalization 
which is based upon an accepted authority. In the 
classroom accepted authorities may be the teacher, 
the textbook, dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc. Pupils 
should be trained to have some authority for the 
generalization used in order that verifications may 
properly become the successful outcome of deductive 
reasoning. 
THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 
As such, we find comparatively little inductive or 
deductive teaching in our schools. Instead we are 
likely to find development lessons which are really a 
combination of the inductive and deductive types. 
For example, a topic is developed by induction down 
to the point of development of the generalization. It 
is usually good practice to allow this generalization to 
be formulated in terms of the child’s own thought. 
Later, if it is thought desirable, the generalization 
may be revised as to mode of expression until it is more 
nearly like the textbook definition. But at first accept 
the definition as the child forms it. Then after the 
generalization has been thus formed, the lesson is
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
taught deductively by proposing a real problem con- 
taining a life situation. It is likely that this type of 
teaching will be met more frequently than either in- 
duction or deduction, and it indicates the development 
of new types of teaching. 
THE APPRECIATION LESSON 
We have taught in our public schools lessons de- 
signed to awaken the child to the beauties of literature, 
music, and art. These fields lend themselves very well 
to the conventional appreciation lesson as taught in 
our elementary schools, but there seems to be no valid 
reason for confining our work in appreciation to these 
three subjects. Every subject has its element of 
appreciation. A pupil can appreciate the fact that 
mathematics makes possible our bridges, our sky- 
scrapers, and our railroads as well as he can appreciate 
the beauties of a sunset. So we have in every subject 
—history, arithmetic, geography, and all the rest—an 
opportunity of teaching appreciation. 
We must appreciate before we can teach apprecia- 
tion—If we do not feel the thrill of joy and pleasure 
which comes when we read a stirring poem, listen to 
good music, or view the sun as it peeps over the hills 
waking the world to a day of activity, we cannot pass 
on that thrill to someone else. In many schools there 
are pictures and poems designated to be taught to the 
pupils of each grade. Many a teacher has struggled 
through the task of so doing in an attempt to comply
-P-A-G-E-85
TYPES OF TEACHING 75 
with the regulations, but it has not been a whole- 
hearted joy, it has been a task. It is better if a 
number of pictures, poems, and prose selections be 
indicated, so that the teacher may have some choice in 
selection and thus teach that which she herself enjoys. 
Forcing expressions of appreciation—Often in our 
teaching of appreciation we attempt to force expres- 
sion of such appreciation from the pupils. We say 
“that’s fine, isn’t it?” and the pupil agrees to please 
us. A young lad was taken to the circus by his father. 
The father was so anxious that his son miss nothing 
that he pointed out so much that the lad saw nothing. 
Some teachers teach appreciation that way. Better 
call attention to but one or two points and permit the 
influence of the selection to make itself felt. The 
expression of the child’s face will tell his appreciation 
far more than any words he might express. The spon- 
taneous expression which comes from the group indi- 
cates the amount of appreciation. 
No formal steps in the appreciation lesson—There 
are no set steps for the teaching of the lesson in appre- 
ciation. Whatever is the subject of appreciation—a 
picture, a poem, or a bit of music—is presented to the 
class. Be sure they understand what is being shown 
to them, but do not carry the analysis to the utmost 
degree or the pupils will lose interest or even be 
repelled. If it be a poem, there is no great need to 
dwell upon the life of the author unless some influence 
which affected his life is reflected in his poem. At first 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
  76 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
it is better to present the poem for what it is; the life 
of the author and other similar elements can be con- 
sidered later—at some other period if it is thought 
desirable. It is folly to require a child to memorize 
the date of the author’s birth and death and the date 
of his entrance to school, college, or the like. Dry 
data like this will result in disliking a poem rather than 
liking it. 
Memorizing literature—If a poem or bit of litera- 
ture or a song is especially enjoyed, it may be memo- 
rized. In later life these gems of literature or music 
are treasured; while much of school work may be for- 
gotten, the fragment of a poem or song remains with 
us. It seems desirable to have literature memorized 
only if it appeals to the child. Much of that which he 
is required to learn is learned under compulsion, and 
is promptly forgotten. That which he really likes 
and enjoys he retains, and it becomes a part of himself. 
Skilful teaching can do much to form the child’s taste 
and ability to appreciate. Just as we learn to like 
olives by eating a number of them, we can often 
develop a liking for literature and music that at first 
glance does not appeal to us. 
Incidental lessons in appreciation—There should be 
taught more lessons in appreciation than we now use 
in the elementary schools. Many of these lessons can 
be incidental. The pictures on the wall make their 
appeal to the child, or will if they are hung low enough 
so they may be seen or if the teacher takes time to 
   
-P-A-G-E-87
  TYPES OF TEACHING V7 
explain the picture to the pupils. Teachers have been 
known never to mention the pictures on the classroom 
walls to their pupils; pictures hanging in classrooms 
have been observed to be covered with grime and dust 
and far above the line of vision of the child as he 
sat at his desk. 
Sources of appreciation lessons—The teacher may 
also find wonderful possibilities of teaching apprecia- 
tion in the nature surroundings of the school. Field 
excursions to observe birds, flowers, trees; the growing 
of bulbs in the classroom, window boxes, and similar 
devices will introduce the child to an appreciation of 
the environment in which he lives. Too often these 
are neglected, especially by the teacher in the city, 
who is likely to think of the school surroundings as 
being void of such material. Such, however, is not 
the case, as but a slight survey will show, and the 
active teacher will be able to discover many possi- 
bilities within range of the classroom. 
THE DRILL LESSON 
Drill is essential to the mastery of any subject. 
Every stimulus is connected with its response by a 
path or connection. Drill deepens this path so as to 
make the response automatic whenever the stimulus 
is presented to consciousness. Thus when the pupil 
sees the word CAT, the path, through drill, has been 
so deepened that immediately the sounds making the 
word CAT are given. Drill belongs to all periods of
-P-A-G-E-88
  78 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
school age. Every subject needs some drill, but in no 
case should we use the method of drill to the exclusion 
of all others. 
Elements of the drill lesson—These elements should 
be present in every drill lesson: (1) The drill lesson 
should be snappy. A drill lesson that is long and 
drawn out defeats the purpose for which it was used. 
The attention of the child wanders; he loses the desire 
to participate, and the result is—nothing accomplished. 
(2) Drill to be effective should be interesting. Often 
an interesting game can be used for drill purposes 
that will give as much actual drill as the ordinary 
method utilized by the teacher. Holding the attention 
and interest of the child secures maximum results. 
The child who participates in drill with his attention 
wandering and his interest gone may be worse than 
gaining nothing; he may actually be learning incor- 
rectly. He may be repeating p-e-n, p-e-n and slip to 
p-i-n without noticing that he has done so. (3) Drill 
should be largely individual. In the old-time school 
there was much of repeating lessons in unison. Some 
teachers use it now. Such drill is not very effective, 
for we cannot make sure that each child is repeating 
correctly—or at all. He may be merely going through 
the motions. Then we will get results such as the 
little girl who learned in unison with other members 
of her class, “Susie Adams forgets Susie Adams,” in 
which case it took considerable conjecture on the part 
of her parents and an interview with the teacher be- 
oi a
-P-A-G-E-89
  TYPES OF TEACHING 79 
fore it was discovered that she had been taught, 
“Enthusiasm begets enthusiasm.” The use of such a 
method will develop plenty of loafers in the class who 
will be perfectly willing to let others do the work. 
The substitution of individual drill methods will 
eliminate entirely such difficulties. (4) Drill in the 
way you wish the knowledge to be used. This means, 
always present the correct form to be learned, never 
the incorrect. Do not drill in this manner: “Do not 
say trespass’, say tres’pass.” The reason for this is 
the fact that after the drill period the pupil who wishes 
to use that which has been drilled will often become 
confused and not remember which form was correct 
and which incorrect. Some teachers carry this to the 
extreme of never permitting a pupil to see an incor- 
rect sentence in English to be corrected or allowing a 
pupil in spelling class to finish spelling a word incor- 
rectly because of the danger of confusion at some later 
time. It is questionable whether such extreme meas- 
ures are necessary, but we can and should avoid the 
incorrect form in drill. 
THE TEST LESSON 
There are times in the school term when the teacher 
is desirous of ascertaining how much her pupils know 
by means of a test or examination. This lesson may 
also result in the teacher’s discovery of how much her 
pupils do not know. As long as there have been 
schools there has been a system of examination. We
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
have it in our schools today as a relic of the past— 
and practically unchanged. We give the pupils a series 
of questions to answer or problems to solve; when 
these are completed we correct the papers with eagle 
eye to detect the smallest possible error. 
Value of test lessons—Tests are desirable forms of 
procedure to show the teacher not only how much her 
pupils know or do not know, but to show her how 
effective her teaching has been. The aim of a test 
should be to test a pupil’s ability to do. We have 
taught him certain facts which are comparable to tools 
for him to use. The test should be for the purpose of 
finding out how well he uses the tools and how effec- 
tive the teaching of the use of them has been. 
The teacher’s test as a reliable factor—It is possible 
for the teacher to formulate a test which no pupil in 
her class will be able to pass, or to write out a test 
which everyone can pass. A teacher’s test is not a 
very reliable factor, for she is likely to go to one 
extreme or the other, seldom between the two. With 
the introduction of standardized tests, now available 
in almost all elementary school subjects, we are taking 
measures to substitute objective measures for sub- 
jective ones. These standard tests make possible the 
comparison of the work of the grade with the standard 
obtained from taking the results of many thousand 
attempts, and also the comparison with marks made 
by other grades in the same subject. If standard tests 
are not available, the teacher may wisely use the plan
-P-A-G-E-91
  TYPES OF TEACHING 81 
of formulating as fair an examination as possible and 
using it over a period of years, being careful to give 
it at about the same time each year. Thus, she can 
compare grades of successive years. 
Less emphasis at present on formal test—Our 
modern school does not place quite so much emphasis 
on the formal test as did the older school. In fact, 
there are many school systems that do not have formal 
tests at all. Even in schools where the formal tests 
are used the final mark or grade in a subject does not 
depend on the test mark alone, but is combined with 
the grade obtained from class recitations. A notable 
exception to this is the Regents System of New York 
State. Promotion in every high school subject de- 
pends upon securing a passing mark in the state 
examination. In place of the formal test teachers are 
using the short, five-minute written or oral test at the 
beginning of the period on the work of the previous 
day. The latest development of the standardized test 
movement has given us the false-true test and the 
completion test, either of which makes possible the 
testing of large groups in a minimum period of time. 
Elements of a good test—A test to be of value must 
be fair, neither too easy nor too hard, afford an oppor- 
tunity for all to do something with it and at the same 
time challenge the best endeavors of the brightest. 
This means that the teacher will be obliged to give 
some thought to the formulation of the test. It cannot 
be written in a few moments. Such a test fairly given 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
will reveal to a teacher the conditions existing in her 
class and tell her of the effectiveness of her teaching. 
In this way we can see that the test is not for the 
pupils only; it is for the teacher as well. 
THE PROJECT LESSON 
The project method of teaching is at once the oldest 
and newest type of teaching used in our schools. It 
was used long as a method before the name project was 
applied to it. The teacher who, in a reading class 
of twenty years ago, said, “I wonder who will be the 
first to find what the dog said,” was using the project 
method in its elemental form. Today it is widely used, 
wisely by many teachers who see the possibilities and 
advantages of the method, and unwisely by those 
teachers who adopt it because it is popular and who 
use the form of it only. 
Elements of the project lesson—Lssentially the 
project method of teaching involves activity. This 
activity is used in the solution of a worth-while life 
situation in which the child’s interest is centered. 
There are three essential parts to the project. (1) 
There must be a compelling motive of such intensity 
that it will initiate activity on the part of the child 
and carry him through to its completion. (2) The 
activity will necessarily .be a life-situation, that is, a 
situation similar to one met with in actual life. 
(3) There should be a testing and proving of results. 
An example will show these various elements. Sup- 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
      TYPES OF TEACHING 83 
pose our project is a party given by one grade to 
another. The motive for this should come as an ex- 
pressed desire on the part of pupils, although in fact 
it is carefully devised by the teacher. It may come 
from a discussion of a story told by the teacher or 
read by the pupils. It may be the result of a child’s 
description of a birthday party he has had or attended. 
However it may come, it must be turned into a class 
activity with each individual selecting the part for 
which he wishes to be responsible. This is usually 
done in the following manner. The question of the 
activity is voted upon and the wishes of the majority 
prevail. Should the majority decide upon the Valen- 
tine party, then plans may be suggested and formulated 
by the group. Various members form themselves into 
committees, one of them to write the invitations, one 
to welcome the guests, one to provide for the refresh- 
ments, one to provide for the entertainment, and so 
on. After the party is over it should be discussed and 
methods of improving the procedure pointed out. 
Individual projects—Not all projects are group 
projects as the one we have just described and ana- 
lyzed. Projects may be individual. In this case the 
same general principles are involved. There must be 
a motive—a desire which is the source or mainspring 
from which the activity derives its driving or comple- 
tion force. The desire to get a high mark on one’s 
report card may be the motive for action, but this is 
an exceedingly poor motive. The building of bird 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  84 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
houses from the motive to help the birds find a sanc- 
tuary is more desirable. Or the building of a radio 
set to bring enjoyment to an invalid is also fine. But 
in any of the cases mentioned, plans must be made, 
ideas formed and rejected, a consideration of material 
to be used, selection of material from that which is 
available, and estimate of cost, comparison with ob- 
jects made by others, and then putting the plans into 
operation and completing the object. But this alone 
is not enough. There must be criticism of the finished 
product. If such criticism can come from one’s class- 
mates who may be engaged in the same or similar 
occupation it counts for much more. Such criticism 
should not be only destructive in its character, but 
should point out and show the good qualities as well. 
The project as a natural method of learning—The 
project method, if carried out extensively, seems to be 
a rather disorganized way of teaching. Especially is 
this true if several projects are being carried out at 
the same time. While it may seem disorganized, yet 
it follows the natural impulses of the child to get the 
answer to his desire. Rousseau advocated many years 
ago a so-called “natural education” of the child, and 
in the project method we see many of its phases. 
Class organization for project teaching—The or- 
ganization of the class for project teaching will depend 
largely upon the materials available. In many in- 
stances pupils will be stimulated to provide much of 
their own, securing it from such sources as cigar boxes
-P-A-G-E-95
  
TYPES OF TEACHING 85 
(light wood), pasteboard boxes, magazine pictures, 
and many similar sources available in most homes. 
Following this plan one teacher had her pupils make 
up a booklet of brown wrapping paper cut to size. 
Each page represented a room in the home and with 
the aid of some old furniture catalogs a home was 
furnished according to the pupil’s desire and fancy. 
Another teacher assisted her pupils in laying out a 
scene in a desert on the sand table. A small oasis was 
formed in which a bit of looking glass served as the 
pool of water, branches and twigs for trees. The trail 
was marked with lengths of crayon and camels and 
nomads of the desert cut from magazine pictures and 
arranged to form a caravan. 
The school arts and the project—But this all sounds 
like play; one wonders how school work is taught by 
this method. A project is likely to involve more than 
one school subject. Consider the making of the bird 
house. There is arithmetic in measurement of ma- 
terial, nature study in deciding upon the features of 
the house, that is, making a home for a certain bird, 
and first studying its habits so that the bird studied 
will make use of the bird house. If a drawing of the 
finished product, or the parts making the product is 
made, we have a means of studying drawing. Writing 
a description of what was done involves penmanship, 
English, and spelling. Reading about birds involves 
silent reading, and the use of supplementary material 
brings in geography and possibly a bit of history. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
    
86 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
fact, a project can very well involve all the school 
arts taught in any grade. One project may well lead 
to another and, by being continued, in the course of 
a term under the direction of a skilful teacher more 
will be accomplished than through the formal types 
of teaching. This type of teaching belongs only to 
the teacher who has carefully studied its technique 
and possibilities, and then only in its smaller units. 
The class is likely to get out of hand if too much is 
attempted at one time. 
The project as a hobby—There is another side to 
the project very little considered by teachers. In 
many instances it furnishes the pupil with a hobby 
which he will continue to pursue after school hours. 
If he starts building a cart, a playhouse, a radio set, 
or whatever it be in school, he will be likely to want 
to do similar things at home. Thus the educative 
value does not stop with the school day, but its influ- 
ence continues beyond it into his life out of school. 
For the child who has no playground except the street 
this is often valuable in providing him with desirable 
out-of-school activities. 
Possibilities of the project—The possibilities of the 
project are many. The teacher will have to find many 
of them herself, as it is often impossible to foresee 
the outcome of any particular activity. There is one 
caution to be kept in mind, and that is to stimulate 
and guide the child toward developing a life-situation 
in his project. In other words, to avoid the artificial 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
    
   
                   
   
          TYPES OF TEACHING 87 
as much as possible. The development of a life situa- 
tion will come as the child feels a need for the activity. 
The work of the teacher will be largely one of pro- 
viding stimulating material so that the felt need may 
arise and the project result. The need to write and 
read can be emphasized by surrounding the child with 
books containing interesting pictures; he will want 
to read about them, and thus arises the need of know- 
ing how to read. To keep his own possessions he will 
need to write his name upon them, and thus will arise 
the desire to learn to write. This follows the natural 
desire and inclination of the child instead of forcing 
him to tasks the meaning of which he may not under- 
stand or which do not appeal to his interest at all. 
Objections to the project—There is the criticism 
that the project method is slow. In some measure this 
is true. Much depends upon the training of the 
teacher, although in schools where the project method 
has been extensively tried, measurement of the 
achievement of children taught by the project method 
as compared with children taught by the more formal 
methods shows little or no difference. 
              
  THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION    
      
  Closely allied to the project method of teaching is 
the socialized recitation. Many of the same ideals 
are fostered by the socialized recitation that we found 
in the project method. The socialized recitation, how- 
ever, is a group activity, and for that reason empha-      
         
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
sizes those characteristics and qualities which are 
essentially group characteristics. Most important of 
these is that of codperation. The socialized recitation 
may be defined, then, as a method used to unite the 
members of a group into a unit of work in which the 
characteristics of responsibility to the group, codpera- 
tion, and a common interest are most prominent. 
No one plan of social organization—There is no 
one set plan for the organization of the socialized 
recitation simply because there is no one plan of 
organization. The group in the kindergarten gathered 
around the teacher simply for the purpose of discus- 
sion is as truly a type of socialized recitation as is the 
highly organized junior city in the junior high school 
grades. The form of organization may vary greatly. 
It is a socialized recitation when the pupils contribute 
freely to the discussion of a problem from their own 
experience, from their reading or observation, and 
when they ask questions of each other and discuss the 
problem of the class hour. 
Essential elements of the socialized recitation—In 
any socialized recitation there are three essential 
elements which contribute to its success or failure. 
These are (1) universal participation, (2) spirit of 
group responsibility, and (3) morale. 
Universal participation—Universal participation 
involves activities that can be entered into by all 
members of the group. There must be present the 
element of all wishing to take part in the activity, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
   
     TYPES OF TEACHING 89 
it is perhaps with this point that most teachers have 
the greatest difficulty. A teacher can never secure 
unity of purpose among the members of her group 
unless there is a spirit of willingness to abide by the 
decision of the majority. Early introduction to this 
as a form of making class decisions will be of great 
service to the teacher in the development of this trait. 
Dramatization of a story read might be the setting for 
a socialized recitation. The selection of the story to 
be dramatized should be the result of the vote of the 
class. Participation in the dramatization should de- 
pend upon selections made for each character by the 
group. 
Spirit of group responsibility—The spirit of group 
responsibility or its lack will make or break the 
socialized recitation. The situation calls for responsi- 
bility to the members of the class and not the teacher. 
Emphasis is placed upon the activity of the pupils— 
not upon the activity of the teacher. Thus participa- 
tion rests upon the approval or disapproval of the 
group, and usually the group will be much more severe 
in its condemnation of one of its own members than 
the teacher would be. This spirit of group responsi- 
bility will bring with it loyalty, codperation, and 
desire to win the approbation of the group. It does 
much for the child because it welcomes him to a group 
composed of his classmates, and in this group is given 
him the opportunity to show his worth or his un- 
worthiness as the case may be. There is no hiding 
     
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
of talents, for he has the opportunity to show his ability 
from the very beginning. 
Morale—Morale is difficult to define. Bagley has 
used the word “fashion” in much the same sense 
(cf. definition by Bagley of discipline). In a sense it 
is a feeling of unity, of good fellowship, of friendliness. 
It is the cement that binds the group together as a 
unit in order that the work of the group be accom- 
plished. While it serves as a means to secure an end, 
viz., the completion of the work assigned, it also 
develops a fine spirit of comradeship that in itself is 
desirable. In its highest development, if morale pro- 
vides for an atmosphere of unity and good fellowship, 
its presence is easily noticed; its absence greatly felt. 
Types of organizations for the socialized recita- 
tion—The organization of the socialized recitation, as 
we have indicated above, ranges from the simple 
unorganized group in the kindergarten or lower grades 
to the highly organized and complex situation in the 
junior high school, in which the group is imitative of 
some plan of government such as city council, state or 
national senate, or junior city. The unorganized group 
is simple, direct, and effective. Too often do we find 
that the cumbersome machine of the socialized recita- 
tion makes it the most formal of all types of teaching. 
The finest type of socialized recitation is that in which 
the group elect a chairman (changed at each meeting 
so that all have equal opportunity) and proceed to 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  TYPES OF TEACHING 91 
discuss the lesson of the day, presenting ideas, asking 
questions, and criticizing opinions expressed. 
In some schools there is organized in the upper 
grades a class or classes, usually those in civics, in 
imitation of the legislative house of the nation. In 
this a bill is introduced and passed through the cus- 
tomary procedure until it becomes a law. Undoubt- 
edly, such an organization does much to teach the child 
the process of law-making. It is a fine group activity, 
but its inherent danger lies in the fact that the child 
is likely to see the machinery and not the idea. The 
teacher should take great pains to keep the socialized 
recitation as simple as possible, so that the initiative 
and spontaneity of the pupil will have all necessary 
room to develop. 
The teacher’s place in the socialized recitation— 
The teacher’s place in all this procedure is interesting 
to note. She can remain in active control or may 
become a member of the group. It would seem that 
the latter plan is better. She can still indirectly con- 
trol the group through suggestion. It places the 
responsibility upon the group and doing thus develops 
the individuals. The teacher is never wise to select 
one pupil from the group-to teach the lesson to the 
class. That is merely a substitution, not a socializa- 
tion. Usually the pupil so selected is from the 
brighter pupils in the class and it often happens that 
the brightest pupils are the least popular. Again it
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
may react unfavorably upon the pupil placed in 
charge. His efforts to conduct the lesson may result 
in dire punishment at the hands of his playmates 
when they catch him outside after school! 
The socialized recitation as a group enterprise— 
The socialized recitation is a group enterprise, and the 
emphasis is placed upon group activity and develop- 
ment of group characteristics. With the major em- 
phasis placed upon this it is not surprising if there 
seem to be few individual characteristics developed. 
A consideration of the activity of the socialized recita- 
tion will reveal some of the personal qualities which 
may be developed. 
Social ideals—Good manners are essential in any 
activity involving the group. The ideals of courtesy 
taught in the primary school are of value here, for 
the pupil simply cannot get along with other pupils 
in the group if he is ill-mannered, sullen, or ill- 
tempered. The group working together on an activity 
will need to treat each other with kindness and con- 
sideration. Tolerance for the ideas of others is also 
needful. In a form of socialized recitation in which 
the members of the class have been divided into 
smaller groups or committees for purposes of work, 
the individual, finding himself a member of such a 
group, must work with it in a spirit of codperation. 
He cannot be a member of the group and allow the 
others to do all the work. Usually pressure from the 
group itself will prohibit anything like this happening. 
ie ree
-P-A-G-E-103
  TYPES OF TEACHING 93 
He will contribute his share according to his ability. 
But the value of working with a group, small or large, 
lies in what it does for the individual. It should make 
him more social, more tolerant, more efficient in his 
work. 
Standard of work—Naturally the group as a whole 
will develop similar qualities to those developed by 
the individual. The teacher can help in securing 
better methods of work by her attitude toward the 
work of the group. You can get from the group what 
you demand. If you demand a high standard of work, 
you will get it; if you are content with work poorly 
done, poorly presented, and half-heartedly prepared, 
that is exactly the type of work pupils are going to 
present. So in the socialized recitation a high or low 
standard of work will be set up, depending upon the 
attitude of the teacher. It is wise to leave pupils 
to their own devices in working out a problem. Too 
often they are handicapped by the mass of details 
suggested or offered by the teacher. As pupils grow 
in their ability to undertake work the teacher should 
more and more merely indicate the problem to be 
solved and permit a wide latitude in securing means 
for solution. It is likely at first that very little will 
result from this, but as the pupil realizes more and 
more his freedom there will be an abundance of 
material searched for contributions to the subject 
under discussion. The tendency may be to the other 
extreme. The pupil is apt to become absorbed in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
minor details, and quantity, not quality, appeals to 
him. Skilful guidance on the part of the teacher and 
drill in selection of important points and rejection of 
non-important points should be resorted to in order 
to assist the pupil. 
Objections of the socialized recitation—The social- 
ized recitation is not without its pitfalls. No attempt 
should be made to use it until the teacher knows her 
pupils. One or two individuals in a class may very 
well be responsible for the failure of the plan. Espe- 
cially would this be true if the pupil were inclined 
to be a bully. His attitude of wanting to be the most 
prominent and under certain types of socialization 
hold the important office would be fatal to harmonious 
working of the group. The problem of the teacher 
will be to know thoroughly her pupils and prepare 
them little by little by voting on the selection to be 
read in reading class, selection of one individual to 
write a letter to an absent classmate, etc., for the com- 
plete plan in which they largely control and conduct 
the work of the class period. 
There are some teachers who close their minds to 
any possibility of improvement in teaching methods. 
These teachers will probably not be interested in the 
socialized recitation. There are others who, hearing 
of any new plan, rush into its use without adequate 
preparation. Every teacher should try the socialized 
recitation after she has carefully prepared herself and 
her class. Discouragement and disappointment will 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
TYPES OF TEACHING 95 
come. Plan on it and continue working for results. 
After having given the plan an adequate trial and 
the results are still disappointing, drop the plan; the 
socialized recitation is not for you. Actual experience 
with it is the only means by which we can discover 
whether we are fitted to use it or not. Opinions, 
guesses, and notions will never tell us—only actual use. 
Socialized recitation meets a need in education— 
The tendency of educational practice is toward less 
formalism and more freedom. The socialized recita- 
tion meets a definite need in the field of education by 
showing the teacher how to secure desirable freedom 
and activity. In certain quarters still holding to ideas 
of formal instruction the socialized recitation will 
meet with little favor. As its purposes and ideals 
become better known it will be used more extensively 
by teachers everywhere. It is not a new type of 
teaching; teachers have been doing something of the 
sort for a long while back, but the name is new, and 
recent impetus given to the method has made it appear 
a brand new type of teaching. 
SUPERVISED STUDY 
We have indicated at various points in our discus- 
sion of individual differences and also in the junior 
high school period the necessity for supervised study. 
There is a growing tendency to use supervised study 
in our schools, and it seems proper to include a dis- 
cussion of it under the topic of types of teaching. Of 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
its organization we shall say little. Regardless of its 
form the essential element is the same—the pupil 
studies his lesson at school under the direction of his 
teacher. 
HOME STUDY 
It is surprising to discover the physical difficulties 
under which some pupils are obliged to study at home. 
Some pupils work after school hours, and for them 
home study is a difficult procedure. But eliminating 
those, the pupil who has plenty of time to study his 
lesson is prevented from doing so because he has no 
adequate place where he may study. To attempt to 
study lessons in the common living room with other 
members of the family, subject to the constant inter- 
ruptions common to such a situation, is to invite 
failure. There is no place in most homes where the 
pupil may study free from interruptions. This means, 
then, that the school must provide what the home 
has failed to do. 
DEVELOPMENT OF STUDY HABITS 
The use of the supervised study plan in school in- 
volves the proper study habits on the part of the’ 
pupil. It is by no means universally true that the 
pupils know how to study. Also the percentage of 
teachers who know how to teach children how to study 
is exceedingly small. It seems advisable to present

          TYPES OF TEACHING 97 
some of the devices now in use to teach pupils how 
to study. 
A STUDY PROGRAM 
First in this list of devices is that of a study pro- 
gram. A program of recitations is common enough, 
but only rarely do we find a program for study. In 
the grades the teacher should provide definitely for 
study periods. If she has but one grade it might be 
wise to plan for one period in the morning and another 
in the afternoon when no classes recite and all pupils 
study. This affords her opportunity to help those who 
need individual assistance. 
The rural school teacher and the teacher of more 
than one grade have the opportunity of working out 
a study program together with the recitation program. 
Such a scheme would be developed as follows: 
PROGRAM FOR GRADES I AND II 
    Recitation Program 
9:00- 9:15—Opening Exercises. 
9:15- 9:30—Reading+grade I. Grade II—Study reading.

9:50-10:00—Number Work— Grade II—Study spelling. 
grade I.

        This partial program will indicate the possibilities 
in such program making. In the upper grades where 
we find departmental teaching the pupil is likely to
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
have vacant periods, during which he is expected to 
study some of his lessons for the following day. Using 
these vacant periods as a basis plus the amount of time 
spent in home study, a composite scheme of study, 
providing for all lessons, may be worked out. If the 
pupil has a definite time at which he is expected to 
study a definite lesson, he is more likely to do it than 
if choice of study of lessons were a matter of whim. 
How to study—But providing a study schedule will 
not assure us of effective effort on the part of the pupil. 
Unless he has been taught efficient habits of study, 
his efforts at work are likely to be haphazard and in- 
effective. How, then, shall we teach pupils to study? 
The following rules of procedure are suggestive and 
may prove of some benefit in teaching pupils to study. 
1. Be sure the physical conditions of the room are 
conducive to study. In school this means proper 
regard for light, heat, and ventilation. In the home 
it means this and also placing one’s self in a comfort- 
able position ready for work. 
2. There must be an incentive to study. It may 
be that fear of incurring the teacher’s displeasure is 
the incentive for work. It may be the desire to get 
a high mark on one’s report card. These are poor 
incentives. To study for mastery in order to be able 
to use something is the most desirable incentive that 
can be set up. Much will depend on the teacher here. 
Her influence will carry over into the study period. 
3. Begin without delay. A pupil may excuse his
-P-A-G-E-109
       TYPES OF TEACHING 99 
delay by saying that he does not understand the 
assignment or that he would begin but he does not 
know what to do. Begin, if it is only to put the 
heading at the tcp of the page or draw the figure for 
the arithmetic problem or write the title of the 
English composition. Do something, and often a solu- 
tion suggests itself. Dawdling and daydreaming over 
a lesson will not secure results. 
4, Know in general what the lesson is about and 
stick to it. Read over the lesson to become orientated. 
Don’t become discouraged if there are difficult parts. 
Skip them for the time being and take the lesson in 
general. Then without permitting the attention to 
wander attack the difficult portions. Do not permit 
trivial distractions to take your mind from the lesson. 
In school pupils should be trained to study, if it is 
study period, under all conditions, and to stop only at 
the end of the period or the command of the teacher. 
5. Separate major and minor topics. It sometimes 
helps if the important topics of a lesson are written 
down and the minor or less important topics written as 
sub-topics. The pupil should have considerable drill in 
selecting important topics in a lesson and separating 
them from those of lesser importance. 
6. Memorize, if memorization is a part of the lesson, 
in accordance with the rules of learning. Briefly, this 
is to learn by wholes rather than parts. If no memo- 
rizing is required in the lesson, this step should, of 
course, be omitted. Frequent recall should be utilized
-P-A-G-E-110
  
100 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
to make the memorization permanent with gradually 
increasing lengths of time ensuing between recall 
periods. 
7. Talk over the lesson with others. After the 
lesson has been thoroughly studied talk it over. Get 
the viewpoint and idea of someone else. If you can 
uphold your ideas to a classmate, it is likely that you 
can do the same in class. By doing this there will 
result an organization of material and a perspective 
view of the entire lesson that is invaluable to a com- 
plete understanding of it. 
Exercises

show how each is essential for the proper conduct 
of the lesson. 
2. What is the value of permitting children to make

CHAPTER V 
PLANNING THE LESSON 
A general preparing for battle, a manufacturer mar- 
keting a new product, a business house building up a 
clientele, all plan long ahead of time just how the 
desired result is to be accomplished. Nothing is left 
to chance, every possible element, every effective 
factor is considered and provided for. The work of 
the teacher in the classroom is every bit as important 
as that of a general, a manufacturer, a merchant, and 
yet a vast majority of teachers go before their classes 
without any definite plan of action, trusting to the 
inspiration of the moment to help them teach the daily 
lesson. It is true that an assignment has been made, 
so that there is some continuity to the lessons, but no 
thought is taken of the effectiveness of one type of 
teaching as against another. 
The lesson plan—Lessons must be definitely 
planned, and for the most part such plans should be 
reduced to writing. The teacher who plans before 
the class period how and what she is going to teach 
and reduces such plans to paper is more likely to 
escape the pitfalls and difficulties arising during the 
lesson period. Especially is it recommended that the 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
inexperienced teacher write out a lesson plan for each 
day’s lesson. It may be pardoned if any experienced 
teacher does not write out each day’s plan, but it is 
more than probable that such a teacher has carefully 
thought through her plan and has it well in mind even 
though it is not in written form. A lesson plan is not 
a permanent plan to be used for a succession of years. 
A new one needs to be written for each class, each 
time it is taught. The type of pupils in the class 
changes from year to year; new developments in the 
subject or methods of teaching it and a whole host of 
factors operate to make the plan ineffective. Elements 
of the old plan can be utilized in writing the new 
one, but the old cannot be substituted in toto for the 
new. 
Factors in the lesson plan—In writing a lesson plan 
we must consider the following factors: (1) the aim, 
(2) how to achieve the aim, (3) what materials we are 
to use in this achievement. It is seen that each part 
fits in with every other, they are interdependent, and 
therefore our plan will be no stronger than its weakest 
part. 
Aim—tThe aim of the lesson considers what you ex- 
pect to do in the class period. Usually every lesson 
has a remote aim and an immediate aim. The remote 
aim links up the lesson with a broader, more funda- 
mental unit of education. We might have as the aim 
of an arithmetic lesson “to make the child socially   
-P-A-G-E-115
  PLANNING THE LESSON 105 
efficient.” But such an aim, while admirable in itself, 
is too broad in its concepts and far beyond the knowl- 
edge of the child. Such an aim could not be completed 
in one lesson, and our lesson aims should be reasonably 
definite so that they may be achieved in the class 
period. Thus we would change the above-mentioned 
aim and express it in immediate terms. “To teach 
the multiplication table of nines” is an immediate aim 
—one that children themselves may grasp and under- 
stand. It still contributes to the broad aim of social 
efficiency, but is expressed in usable form. It is 
essential to every well-formulated lesson plan that the 
aim of the lesson receives primary consideration in 
order that the lesson proper may revolve about it. 
The aim is comparable to selection of designation. 
The teacher has before her where she is going—what 
she is going to do. 
Methods—The methods to be used in achieving our 
aim are the next consideration. The skilful teacher 
will carefully consider the methods of teaching the 
lesson that are available, and then select the one she 
considers is best adapted to the purpose she has in 
mind and the kind of class she has. The method as 
written on a plan cannot be complete in all minor 
details. To indicate to the teacher as she uses the plan 
the method and at the same time serve as a guide in 
completing the lesson without wandering and useless 
discussion of minor points, it is desirable to formulate 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
a few questions that will serve to bring out the impor- 
tant points of the lesson. These questions are “key- 
questions” and the lesson plan should contain a 
number of these. They should be carefully formu- 
lated, and in some instances they should be worded 
with definite pupils in mind. That is, the teacher in 
writing the plan may decide on the pupils upon whom 
she will call for certain parts of the lesson. The key- 
questions may be formulated to fit the pupils decided 
upon. 
Materials—The materials available to assist in 
teaching a lesson should be considered before the 
lesson, not during or after. It is most annoying to 
have a teacher stop her class in the middle of a lesson 
to get some material from the supply room which 
she neglected to secure before class hour. If a lesson 
plan is written, the materials available will be thought 
of, entered on the plan, and secured before the class 
period. Then there will be no wait, no hesitancy in 
teaching the lesson. If practice is made of listing the 
materials to be used, the very fact will stimulate 
thought as to materials which are available and 
usually results in a greater amount of materials being 
used. 
Form of the lesson plan—The form of lesson plan 
is immaterial. One plan is as good as another provid- 
ing it makes due provision for the three divisions 
mentioned above. The following form is found useful 
in many schools.

Note that at the end of the blank there is provision

“results” the reaction of the class. This serves her as 
a guide in making out a similar lesson plan or in re- 
vising this one for further use.

The following report of a teacher’s use of a situation 
and its development into a project is interesting. 
This is not presented in lesson plan form, although, 
from the report as given, it is easy to discover the 
various parts of the lesson plan. 
Prosect—Cement. 
Miss Alda Henry, Carnegie Public Schools. 
A cement mixer caused it all. One miserable morning was spent 
in trying to rival the noise, but by noon the teacher saw it was 
useless. Something must be done. The something became the fol- 
lowing project. 
Permission was obtained to visit the new road and watch the 
mixer at work. Boxes were taken and generous samples of sand, 
gravel, and cement brought back. 
When the question, “What was used to make that road?” was 
asked, these materials were brought to the attention of the entire 
class. But when “What is cement made from?” was asked, silence 
reigned. No one knew. 
Now was the place and time for the use of past material and 
ideas. 
Who can find out? A dozen hands were raised to answer. 
Where? 
Down town is a store where they sell cement. I’ll go in there 
and see. 
My father’s a plasterer. I’ll see if he knows. 
Children, the ones who do not have any one to ask or who do 
not know of a place to go, use your texts. Some were assigned 
“cement” as a subject for research. They were to tabulate the 
pages where a reference to cement was made. The one who first 
found five references might put his on the board. Others were sent 
to the supply room for a table. When it came we put a clean paper 
on it and arranged our boxes of cement, sand, and gravel. 
The second day found each desk supplied with a note book, 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  114 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
scratch paper, and a strong envelope. Two large note books were 
put on the table with the cement display. 
Before class two pupils had put their list of references on the 
board. The entire class was set at work finding and reading these 
references. As the name of a city where cement was manufac- 
tured was found, it was put on the board. One slate was used for 
this and another for the countries where cement was mentioned. 
Above the table hung two outline maps. One was of the World 
and the other of the United States. In colored crayon the cement 
rock producing regions had been indicated. Cities prominent in 
cement manufacture were inserted in another color. 
When questions dealing with the ingredients of cement were 
asked, we found that some pamphlets published for advertising 
purposes by cement companies told the whole story. An order was 
sent—really it was a request as these are free except the postage— 
and enough copies were obtained for all students. 
In the note books a record of all cement producing countries was 
kept. The names of cities prominent in its manufacture were in- 
serted also. Each pupil tried to get as many pictures denoting uses 
of cement as he could. The results opened the eyes of teacher and 
pupils alike to the real value of cement. The uses of cement are 
so common that we scarcely notice how important it is. In place 
of a written discussion of cement making, the pamphlets were 
pasted in the note books. This note book work was not done until 
nearly all the material had been collected. The envelopes and 
scratch paper served us by keeping all these records until the time 
for their neat entry into the note books. 
In one of the class books the pupils pasted pictures describing 
cement uses. They put the very best pictures here and used the 
remaining ones for their own note books. In the second note book 
were pasted the cement manufactories of Pennsylvania. A small 
map of Pennsylvania drawn by a pupil and colored in a fashion 
similar to the maps of the World and of the U. S. was put in this 
note book. 
All the pamphlets collected other than those used for the class 
note books were stacked on the table. These were used for refer- 
ence work during class periods. From the samples of cement, sand, 
and gravel put on the table, several boys made concrete in class 
one day. A small box was used as a form and the cement block 
used for exhibition. 
A study similar to the foregoing not only makes us more familiar

with this common material, but it also opens the way to a study 
of other building materials such as marble, stone, or brick. 
The last lesson plan submitted as a sample is one 
using the inductive method. It indicates very fully 
the key questions that will bring out the essential parts 
of the lesson.

Resutrs: The term “pronoun” was familiar to some pupils. The 
lesson was successful as the application was made correctly in all 
instances. 
The sample lesson plans presented will indicate the 
type of lesson plan the teacher should have before her 
as she teaches the lesson. Perhaps one of the greatest 
values of the lesson plan lies in the thought the 
teacher must give to the lesson before it is taught. 
The thought required is the greatest foe to formal 
methods of lesson hearing. There would be a most 
remarkable change in teaching methods and in results 
that would be obtained in our schools if we could 
compel all teachers to write out a lesson plan before 
they taught any classes. Our greatest danger comes 
from the experienced teacher who is likely to consider 
the lesson plan as unnecessary for her. Has she not 
taught second grade for the last ten years, and does 
she not know all the lessons taught in that grade by 
heart? Why, then, should she write a lesson plan? 
This is the very teacher who needs the lesson plan the 
most. Her familiarity with the subject has bound her 
to teach it exactly in the same way she taught it for 
the first time ten years previous. Times, materials, 
and methods have changed, and even though an old 
method may be successful, it is sometimes worth while 
to try new methods even if they fail. 
Lesson plans are the blue prints by which the 
skilful teacher builds a foundation. That foundation 
is sound social attitudes and the structure is an indi-

Exercises 
1. Why does the efficient teacher plan her lesson? 
2. What are the factors in the lesson plan? Show how 
each one is essential to a well taught lesson. 
8. Criticize this lesson aim. “The aim of this lesson 
is to teach the multiplication table.”

geography on the topic “Products of Kansas.” 
5. Visit a classroom for an entire classroom period and 
reconstruct the teacher’s lesson plan. 
6. What is a “Key question” and what is its value? 
7. Why is it not a valid argument for an experienced 
teacher to say that she does not need a lesson plan 
because she has taught the subject so often she is 
thoroughly familiar with it? 
8. Secure sample lesson plans and discuss them accord- 
ing to the standards set up in this chapter.

        CHAPTER VI 
THE TEACHER AT WORK 
  The teacher at work! What a picture is presented 
to our minds as we try to comprehend the thousands 
of teachers who enter the classroom every day to teach 
still more thousands of pupils. The immensity of the 
picture takes it far from our conception. To the lay 
mind the teacher’s job is a very simple one. At the 
most it is five hours a day for five days a week. There 
is nothing about it especially “hard” and certainly 
nothing that warrants a very high salary. Suppose 
we analyze the teaching situation and observe the 
truth or falsity of these statements. 
Physical conditions of the schoolroom—To all 
teachers is charged the responsibility of proper seating, 
lighting, temperature, and ventilation. In schools 
having adjustable seats there should be frequent in- 
spections to see that the seat fits the pupil—the older 
notion was that the child should fit the seat. If the 
desks are non-adjustable but are of different heights 
the teacher has the problem of assigning the proper 
pupils to desks that will best fit them. Should there 
be no difference in desk height the problem is not en- 
tirely hopeless. Small foot rests can be built to cor- 
119  
-P-A-G-E-130
  120 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
rect the situation of a pupil sitting in a seat so high 
that his feet do not touch the floor. 
Lighting—Our modern schools provide for proper 
lighting, ie., the light coming from the left side of 
the room only. Many of our older types of schools 
permit light to enter from two sides, thus causing 
cross lights which make it difficult for the pupil to see 
or work. In many rural schools we find an arrange- 
ment of windows that compels pupils to look directly 
into the light, a situation to be remedied at once by 
closing up the windows with plaster board or a similar 
material. The judicious use of shades will agreeably 
change the lighting effects in the classroom. 
In most schools the teacher is unable to control the 
heat supplied her room. She should become familiar 
with the control of radiators, registers, etc., so that 
she is able to regulate the temperature of the room to 
the extent that it is possible to do so. A good working 
temperature for a schoolroom is 68 degrees, and any 
room falling below this or above it should be promptly 
reported to the janitor. Pupils cannot do their best 
work if cold, neither can much be accomplished if 
the room is too warm. The thermometer should be 
frequently consulted. 
Heat and ventilation—Teachers are apt to be care- 
less with respect to heat and ventilation. Because 
they are moving about they are likely to assume the 
room to be warmer than it really is. The keeping 
of a temperature chart on which is recorded the tem-   
-P-A-G-E-131
THE TEACHER AT WORK 121 
perature of each hour of the day will do much to 
assist the teacher to a realization of actual tempera- 
ture conditions in the room. 
If the building is provided with an automatic system 
of ventilation the teacher should know how to handle 
it. Misdirected zeal in opening windows will often 
cause the whole system to become inoperative. It is 
better to conform to directions than to cause the 
entire ventilating system to be out of working order, 
even if conformity does seem to give the room an 
insufficient amount of fresh air. 
So the classroom teacher has many material things 
to think about, adjust, and attend to before she begins 
the actual teaching of her class. All of this is in- 
creased many fold if she be a rural schoolteacher and 
acts as her own janitor. We are beginning to see that 
the schoolteacher’s position has many aspects we 
scarcely realized. 
The class as a stimulus for work; routine—The 
class seated before her stimulates the teacher to active 
and effective teaching. The teacher is master of the 
situation; she has her lesson plan and is ready for 
real work. Immediately the problem of routine con- 
fronts her. She wishes to send a group of pupils to 
the blackboard, another group to the sand table, she 
wishes to pass out materials and collect papers, the 
fire gong rings and the problem of proper lines is to 
be solved. A well-ordered school is characterized by 
the manner in which these routine activities are 
   
-P-A-G-E-132
  122 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
handled. The activities which call for routine should 
be so organized that confusion, noise, and disorder 
will disappear and the activities pass off as automatic. 
To secure this the teacher must insist on the way in 
which an activity is to be carried out. For example, 
all are to pass to the board in a certain way by pass- 
ing down a certain aisle and taking a position so that 
there is plenty of space on either side, rather than 
all rushing down several aisles and fighting, pushing, 
and shoving to secure imaginary favorite places at the 
board. In the same way devise a scheme for collecting 
of materials—all pass to front of room and then one 
pupil collects from front row and hands to the teacher, 
or any similar plan. A room in which the various 
activities are routinized will do twice the work of a 
room in which they are not, and will do it better. 
Danger of routine—There is a danger of overem- 
phasizing routine. We are prone to consider the 
Imperial Prussian schools as the last word in routine. 
Many of our American schools are highly routinized 
and teaching in them is merely to be a cog in a huge 
machine. Routine under such circumstances is likely 
to become an end in itself. The pupils are more con- 
scious of the machinery than of the idea behind it and 
as a result the enthusiasm of the group is crushed. 
Routinize only what is necessary, such as movements 
in the classroom, distribution, and collection of ma- 
terials, and entering and leaving the building. This 
is a good rule, especially for the novice to heed.
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE TEACHER AT WORK 123 
Seating schedules—For the convenience of the 
teacher in becoming acquainted with her group, it is 
wise to make a seating schedule of her room. This 
shows the location of each pupil in the class. A copy 
of this should be in the teacher’s desk in order that if 
it is necessary for a substitute to take the class that 
such schedule is ready to help the substitute become 
quickly acquainted. The same applies to the daily 
recitation and study program. In some schools a 
copy of this program is framed and fastened to the 
outside of the classroom door. It serves the purpose 
of permitting a visitor to know what classes are re- 
citing without entering the room. It isa very excellent 
plan to have a recitation program in a permanent 
place in the classroom. Such a program once deter- 
mined should be rigidly adhered to. Some teachers 
use the program in much the same fashion as the 
colored clergyman who announced his text and then 
added “—and from which I will proceed to depart.” 
A recitation schedule adhered to instils the habit of 
order in both teacher and pupil and insures that a 
day’s work will be done and not that the teacher will 
ride her hobby to the exclusion of other subjects. 
Reports; the register—All reports of the classroom 
teacher should be ready on the date due. The register 
of daily attendance should always be in the teacher’s 
desk. It is a distinct handicap for a substitute teacher 
to enter a classroom and find neither seating schedule 
nor register, no program of daily recitations, and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-134
    124 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
teacher’s desk locked. A good teacher is a good 
bookkeeper with all records and reports written up 
promptly, ready for inspection at any time. 
These material considerations of the teacher’s work 
in the classroom are usually unobserved by the casual 
visitor to the classroom. The work of the teacher with 
the class is directly observed and usually receives the 
greater share of attention. 
Questioning—The art of conducting a recitation 
includes the art of questioning. In the chapter on 
lesson plans we indicated a type of question known as 
the “key question.” The key question indicates the 
important topic which is introduced by the answer 
thereto. A lesson may have several, and it is of the 
utmost importance to the teacher that these questions 
be carefully formulated before the class period. 
Types of questions; leading question—Questions 
that are asked in class are usually not written out 
beforehand by the teacher. The skill of the teacher 
in asking questions will be greatly increased if certain 
principles are observed. Thus, a teacher should ask 
the question in such a manner that the answer is not 
indicated. “The Dutch settled New York, didn’t 
they?” is a poor question, for the answer is given in 
the question itself. ‘“Who settled New York?” is a 
much better form of the question. Pupils are often 
skilful guessers. A pupil appears ofttimes to be bright, 
whereas he is only skilful in guessing the answer the 
teacher wants.   
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE TEACHER AT WORK 125 
The name of the pupil should not be given until the 
question has been given. “Donald, what is the capital 
of Pennsylvania?” holds the attention of Donald. 
The rest of the class are mentally relieved as soon as 
the name is pronounced, and consequently feel no re- 
sponsibility for the answer to the question. “What is 
the capital of Pennsylvania—Donald?” keeps every- 
one on his toes mentally until the question is asked, 
and thus holds his attention longer. 
Fact question—The example of question which we 
have just given asks for a fact. The answer will de- 
pend entirely upon the pupil’s memory. If he has 
learned the fact asked for, he will be able to answer 
the question; if not, he cannot. Lessons testing the 
knowledge of the pupil with respect to the facts of 
the lesson will contain many of these questions. How- 
ever, we are much more concerned, ordinarily, not with 
facts which a pupil may have stored away in his mind, 
but his ability to organize the material he has read 
and studied and then present the same in a series of 
sentences, a paragraph or series of paragraphs. To do 
this the teacher must employ an entirely different type 
of question. “Why is sugar cane grown in Louisiana 
and not in Pennsylvania?” requires the pupil to think. 
Such thinking may be on the basis of experience, 
experimentation, reading, or study. The teacher has 
asked the pupil a thought-provoking question. The 
answer involves reflection, organization of known facts, 
and a presentation of them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  126 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
The technique of questioning—There is a technique 
of asking questions. We have indicated one element 
in it when we explain why a teacher should call upon 
the pupil to answer after the question has been stated. 
A second element in the technique of questioning is 
to avoid repeating, restating, or answering the ques- 
tion. A teacher, not skilled in formulating questions, 
will often ask the same question a number of times in 
different ways before asking for the answer. This 
as well as repeating the pupil’s answer is a waste of 
time, and leads to very undesirable habits on the part 
of pupils. They know if they wait the question will 
be restated or, if answered, the teacher will restate the 
answer, and consequently there is no reason for them 
to be mentally alert. 
Value of summaries—It is usually good practice to 
ask a pupil to summarize statements made or the 
progress of the lesson at various points. Near the end 
of a lesson a summary is especially valuable. This 
serves as an incentive for pupils to give continuous 
attention. If a pupil does not know when he will be 
called upon to sum up the work of the class, he will 
keep himself in an attentive attitude to be ready to 
do so. 
Voice—Much might be said about the use of the 
voice in asking questions. The teacher who has a 
weak voice will have difficulty in making pupils under- 
stand her questions. But this does not mean that 
the teacher must shout. A low-pitched voice, pleasant 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
THE TEACHER AT WORK 127 
and authoritative, will carry to all parts of the room. 
The loud, strident voice will carry, it is true, but it 
will also react unfavorably upon the pupils in the 
course of a day’s work. The teacher should enunciate 
clearly and pronounce correctly. 
English—It seems hardly necessary to speak of the 
English of the teacher. Only the fact that many 
teachers use poor English prompts a word. Especially 
in asking questions the teacher should be exceedingly 
careful as to correct English usage. Writing out key 
questions and practice in formulation of classroom 
questions merely as a preparatory exercise will be 
found to be of great assistance to the teacher. 
The assignment—Every lesson taught depends upon 
and in turn involves an assignment. It may be simple 
—‘Solve problems 1 to 10 on page 76”—or complex. 
The majority of assignments are made in the closing 
moments of the class period, perhaps as the pupils 
are passing from the room, in a hurried manner. The 
assignment is important, in fact more important than 
most teachers consider. Our teacher in the classroom 
at work looks upon the assignment as the basis upon 
which the lesson is to be studied, and the recitation 
the next day will be a success or a failure, depending 
upon the assignment. The assignment should be clear 
and definite and after it is made the pupil should know 
exactly what he is to do, how it is to be done, and 
what will be expected of him when he comes to class 
the following day. It is obvious that good results 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
    128 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
cannot be obtained if the assignment is vague and 
indefinite. 
The place of the assignment—To eliminate the 
difficulties likely to arise from giving the assignment 
at the end of the period, some teachers are using the 
plan of making the assignment at the beginning of the 
period. This is a fairly good plan. Its disadvantage 
lies in the fact that often a teacher wishes to reassign 
parts of a lesson, or even a whole lesson. The necessity 
for this usually does not arise until the lesson has been 
taught. Then if the assignment has been made it is 
likely to cause confusion if changes and additions are 
made. 
There is a practice of making the assignment as the 
lesson progresses—making it piecemeal. Such practice 
is almost sure to result in a big assignment, too large 
for completion. The various sections of it seem trivial 
enough when given, but the aggregate is surprisingly 
large. This practice cannot be recommended, and had 
best be seldom attempted. 
The wise teacher will at times work out one of her 
own assignments. Doing this and keeping account of 
the time involved will show to the teacher the amount 
of work she is requiring from her pupils. An assign- 
ment may seem small enough to the teacher, and she 
may predetermine the time necessary to complete it; 
the same assignment from the pupils’ point of view is 
much too long. Actually working one of her own 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  
THE TEACHER AT WORK 129 
assignments will help a teacher in determining whether 
her assignments are too long or too short. 
If it is definitely planned for, to give the assignment 
at the end of the lesson period seems most desirable. 
Then we may include any loose ends of the day’s 
lesson. Sections for review may be included. An 
assignment of any type at all worth while cannot be 
made in three minutes. It will take from five to ten 
minutes to make an adequate assignment if the teacher 
really wishes to send her pupils to the study hour with 
definite directions as to what is to be done with the 
lesson in the way of preparation. 
Sample assignments—Some sample assignments are 
given below. Note that they are clear and concise 
and that the pupil knows exactly what to do when he 
studies his lesson. : 
“Find a newspaper article of recent date dealing 
with some fact or facts concerning Pennsylvania. 
Read the article thoroughly. Outline this article. 
When you come to class tomorrow be prepared to give 
the thought of the article you select by speaking from 
the outline you make.” 
“Read thoughtfully pages 320-321-322. Then pre- 
pare answers to these questions. (Key questions) 
1. What is meant by “safety first,” and why put safety 
first rather than second or third? 2. Why is “safety 
first” a civic duty? 
“Be prepared to answer these questions and bring in 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 FIRST BOOK IN ED CATION 
a list of rules (number not stated) for “safety first” 
that we should observe in our school.” 
“Read carefully and thoroughly pages 312 and 313. 
Be able to tell what is meant by “platform.” (Key 
question) What would a “civic platform” include? 
(Key question) Come to class prepared to contribute 
to the forming of a civic platform for our civic league.” 
Observing other teachers—The classroom teacher 
often enters upon her position without having ob- 
served teaching other than that done in the training 
period of her preparation. In most cases this was 
teaching by the expert supervisor. In instances of 
teachers who have had little professional training it 
is not surprising to discover that they have never 
observed teachers teaching, except as they themselves 
were students in class. In both instances we find 
teachers teaching as they were taught or as they have 
observed their supervisors teach. 
Visiting days for teachers—Every school should 
make some provision for visiting days. More than 
that, it should insist upon the teacher visiting the 
classroom of some other school. This may be in the 
same system or in a neighboring system. If the teacher 
herself knows of an expert teacher from whom she 
may learn much, she should ask for a visiting day. 
Visiting another teacher often clarifies one’s own 
problem. New ideas, new methods, new thoughts are 
the result of such visitation. After a teacher has been 
in her own classroom for a year, two years, or more,   
-P-A-G-E-141
       THE TEACHER AT WORK 131 
to visit another classroom brings her to realize that 
here is another teacher meeting the same problems, 
the same difficulties, the same perplexities. Visiting 
classrooms is of greater benefit than a whole series of 
lectures or institutes. 
Visitation reports—This visitation should not be 
without its purpose, :nd should be made with the idea 
of bringing back i a deinite form the benefit of such 
a visit. A blank form which may be used for such 
purpose is herewith shown. Primarily formulated as 
a report to the Superi: tendent of Schools it is equally 
valuable as a record for the teacher herself.

Professional advancement—The visiting day is but 
one of the many opportunities open for professional 
advancement. The classroom teacher, the supervisor, 
the administrator, no matter where he may be located, 
has the opportunity for advancement in professional 
attainments. Lectures, extension courses, summer 
schools, travel, correspondence courses, are some of 
the possibilities. We do not have a great deal of 
confidence in the doctor who does not keep up to date 
in his profession. We simply will not go to the dentist 
who does not use modern dental methods. And yet 
many teachers take the attitude that once having 
secured a teachers’ certificate that is all the education 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
THE TEACHER AT WORK 133 
they will need. Teachers more than members of any 
other profession need to keep abreast of modern 
tendencies in education. It is essential that they be 
alive professionally. One of the greatest criticisms of 
the teaching profession is that its members are not 
modern. How inspiring it would be if we could find 
the members of one State all belonging to a State 
Teachers’ Association, actively engaged in advancing’ 
education in all the schools of the State! 
No amount of talking about it will ever secure re- 
sults. The urge for professional advancement must 
come from the teachers themselves. It.could easily 
be secured by requiring a teacher to do something 
each year—attendance of summer school, extension, 
or correspondence courses—in order to validate her 
certificate for the following year. 
The progressive classroom teacher will take advan- 
tage of all educational opportunities. There is a defi- 
nite reward for it all. Promotion, advancements, and 
the like come only to the teacher who studies. Every 
teacher should have a professional library. It would 
be interesting to discover how many teachers have— 
or have not. Yet we would not think much of a doctor 
or lawyer without a library of professional volumes. 
There is such a wealth of material available in pro- 
fessional education books that a professional library 
for teachers should be a part of the equipment of 
every teacher. 
Our teacher at work in the classroom is busy. Until 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
one spends a day in the classroom with her the amount 
of energy required, the patience, the sympathy can 
never be imagined. Teaching is service, and at times 
it is discouraging. The service will be irksome to the 
classroom teacher who sees only in her work the “job” 
of teaching school. Translating ~ervice in terms of 
pupil and social welfare makes of school teaching a 
profession. The rewards are intangible, but they are 
nevertheless sure and priceless. The aim of the true 
teacher is not wealth; it is the inspiration, the help, 
and the ideals that can be given to the pupils in the 
classroom. 
Exercises 
1. What are the standards of lighting, heating, and

charged with the responsibility of caring for 
these? 
2. List the activities of the ordinary classroom which 
should be routinized. 
3. Give examples of (a) leading question, (b) fact 
question. Why should the question be asked 
before the pupil is called upon to recite? 
4, Why should pupils be required to outline their 
lessons?

  CHAPTER VII 
- THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
All teacher training institutions make provision for 
the observation of teaching. This observation may be 
of classes in the model or training school in connection 
with the institution or it may be observation of classes 
in a neighboring city. Observation of expert teaching 
in a model or training school is likely to produce an 
artificial situation. The supervisor or critic teacher 
teaches the class, knowing beforehand that she will 
have a group of observers. In many cases the demon- 
stration teaching is carefully planned for this group 
of observers. The observers see expert teaching, but 
not always the ordinary situation met in the average 
classroom. 
The purpose of observation—If observation of 
teaching is to serve its purpose it should be the obser- 
vation of teaching of a group in actual classroom 
situations.. The purpose of observing is twofold: 
(1) To observe with an idea of selecting the group in 
which one expects to teach (Kindergarten, Primary, 
Intermediate, Junior High School, Rural School). 
(2) To observe in order to solve some problem of 
education (type of teaching, discipline, etc.). In 
136
-P-A-G-E-147
THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 137 
other words, observation should be with the very defi- 
nite idea of solving a problem. To the beginning 
student of education it gives the opportunity of look- 
ing upon a classroom as a prospective teacher. The 
selection of group for specialization is a most impor- 
tant part of the student teacher’s training, and fre- 
quent observation in the various grades of the school 
gives the student an opportunity to see the actual work 
in the grades and assists her in selecting the place 
where she can do her best work. 
Directed observation—The observation of teaching 
on the part of the prospective teacher should not be 
without direction. Promiscuous observation without 
definite aim is worse than none. To be of value, 
observation must be approached very much in the 
same manner as laboratory work is undertaken. An 
experiment is a question put to nature. An observa- 
tion is the solving of educational problems by seeing 
them solved in actual classroom situation by expert 
teachers. The student of education entering a class- 
room should therefore have a definite problem in mind, 
the solution of which is sought by the observation of 
expert teaching. 
These problems may very well be graded and include 
the various topics of theoretical education which are 
being discussed in the theory classes. One of the best 
forms of directed observations is to be found in 
Landsittel’s “Observation Record Book in the Study 
of Teaching.” This book in the hands of the pupil

under the direction and guidance of the teacher of 
education (theory class) serves an admirable purpose 
in presenting a problem and requiring a written reac- 
tion to it. A sample exercise is herewith presented:

OBSERVATION ProsteM: How is instruction affected by a composi- 
tion of the instruction group? 
1. What effects seem to come from there being a large or small 
number in the group? From disparities in age, size, race, or other 
personal characteristics? 
2. What does the teacher do by way of putting the members 
individually or the group collectively, in condition favorable for 
work? 
3. Does the group need working materials (textbooks, paper, 
pencils, etc.) which are not supplied in proper kind or amount? 
What are the effects of the lack of these things? 
4, Do any members of the group show mental or physical de- 
fectiveness in relation to the type and standard of instruction em- 
ployed? Point out your evidences. 
5. Find out whether the teacher in charge of the group observed 
has taken advantage of proper means of knowing as to possible de- 
fective equipment (eyesight, hearing, mentality, etc.) of individual 
pupils. What means of doing this are available to teachers? 
6. Cite instances showing influence coming from the group that 
tends to promote intensified forms of effort or to help pupils to 
learn. 
7. Do the members of the group show training in codperation 
among themselves? Do they show a disposition to codperate with 
the teacher? 
8. What seems to be the motive of the members of this group 
in being present for instruction? How many would evidently re- 
main if not required to, and why? 
9. What evidences seem to indicate that the period of work ts 
of proper duration, or too long, or too short?

To illustrate the use of the problem in observation 
we present another observation outline as filled in by 
the student. The reactions of the pupil observing were 
written immediately after observing the class and 
before general class discussion of the observation took 
place.

OsseRvATION Prostem: How do emotional factors and emotional 
states affect classroom work? 
1. How does the general emotional tone of the classroom impress 
you? Is it buoyant? Happy? Dull? Depressed? Gloomy? Cite 
effects. 
The general emotional tone of the classroom impressed me as 
being buoyant and happy. The pleasing voice of the teacher acted 
as a stimulant to the pupils and caused them to feel more free 
and friendly toward her. 
2. To what extent is it the effect of the personality or spirit of 
the teacher? How is the teacher affected by it? 
A large extent of it is due to the teacher’s personality or spirit. 
If she is happy and full of pep the class will contract her attitude 
and vice versa. The teacher can make her work pleasant or other- 
wise, just as she chooses. 
3. Do striking emotional conditions appear in individual pupils? 
To what do they seem to be due? And how do they affect the 
work in hand?

Two children in particular seemed to giv one the impression 
they were glad to be in school. They showed willingness to give 
such information as they could to the class. Probably it was be- 
cause they liked the lesson, for they were well prepared. 
4. What relation do the physical conditions of the room—tem- 
perature? Light? Tint of the walls? Decorations? Cleanliness? 
Orderly arrangement, etc., seem to bear toward the emotional tone? 
If the room is in a good orderly condition the pupils uncon- 
sciously fall into harmony with it. 
5. To what extent is the tone of the classroom due to the kind 
of activity in which the pupils are engaged? 
If the lesson to be studied is of such a nature that deep thinking 
is required, the classroom should be quiet and orderly. 
6. Point out incidents arising in instruction which excite signifi- 
cant emotional responses in pupils. Indicate the responses. 
A problem is given or a question is asked, The response given 
is incorrect and at once pupils are eager to right it. 
Summary: 
It is important to realize the necessity of an orderly room; that 
emotional factors and states greatly affect classroom work; that 
it is difficult to teach effectively unless the emotions are stirred to 
some extent. 
Things to Imitate: 
The perfect ease with which the teacher handled the class. Making 
the lesson practical. 
Things to Avoid: 
Facts should be more clearly related to each other so that the 
pupils may get the connection. 
Questions: 
Would you feel discouraged if the pupils did not respond readily 
on the day’s lesson?

Organizations of observations—There are any 
number of ways in which observations undertaken by
-P-A-G-E-151
       THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 141 
  a class may be organized. In one organization one 
period per week is spent by the entire class together 
with the teacher of education in the classroom of the 
model or training school. Here teaching of the super- 
visor or critic is observed—never that of student 
teachers. After spending the period in observation the 
group returns to its own classroom and discusses the 
observation just made with particular reference to the 
problem in hand. References are assigned for further 
study and the observation becomes part of the basis 
upon which the theory of educational practice is built. 
The disadvantage which comes from this lies in the 
size of the group observing. To have thirty or forty 
students enter a classroom causes confusion and is, in 
some cases, bound to create a crowded condition of 
the classroom. In spite of the fact that the schedule 
of observation takes the student into each grade twice, 
it does not permit a student especially interested in 
the work of any one grade to observe it any more than 
that. On the other hand, it does compel a student to 
visit all grades and become somewhat acquainted with 
their problems instead of observing in one or two 
grades only. 
The second plan of organization permits more free- 
dom in choice of observation on the part of the student. 
The critic teachers make out a list of demonstration 
teaching for the entire week. These are condensed 
into a form as indicated below:

This type of organization permits the student to 
select and to follow observation in the same grade over 
a period of weeks. It eliminates crowded conditions 
in the classroom and makes the observation a more 
personal matter. The most serious disadvantage 
comes from the tendency of the student to observe in 
but one or two grades, usually those in which she has 
a desire to teach, without observing in the other 
grades. Also there is not the opportunity for class 
discussion of the observation unless conference periods 
are provided by the teacher of education in which he 
meets all students who observed in a particular grade 
during the week. 
Both forms are used extensively in our teacher train- 
ing institutions. Whichever form is used or if an 
entirely different procedure is followed, the funda- 
mental purpose of the observation must be kept in 
mind. Its function is to serve as a laboratory for the 
solution of a problem. 
In the observation of teaching the student observes 
someone, usually an expert, do the work. The time 
comes in her professional training when she must take 
charge of the class. This makes for an entirely 
different proposition. Before this she was a spectator, 
now she is in full charge. The novice teacher is pre- 
   
-P-A-G-E-155
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 145 
pared for the day’s work. She has her lesson plan and 
has reviewed her knowledge of the subject. To an 
extent she is ready for the day’s work. But as a baby 
in learning to walk is never far from his mother’s hands, 
so the teacher in training is ever under the direct super- 
vision of her critic teacher. 
Practice teaching—Practice teaching in a training 
or model school is mostly teaching under artificial 
conditions. The problems to be met in subject matter 
and discipline are largely solved. The critic teacher 
assures herself of the student teacher in training 
ability, in material, and methods, and is within call 
if serious problems of discipline occur. Later as the 
novice grows in teaching ability, the support of the 
critic teacher is gradually withdrawn until the novice 
stands alone. But even with this condition existing 
it is not the equivalent of actual teaching in a public 
school. 
The apprentice plan—The plan followed in many 
places of placing student teachers in actual classrooms 
with successful, experienced teachers is more of an 
approach to real schoolroom conditions. The novice 
first observes the room teacher and slowly enters into 
participation of the work of the class, gradually assum- 
ing full responsibility. This plan has much to com- 
mend it. It places the teacher in training in a situa- 
tion very much like that which she will meet when 
she teaches. The artificial atmosphere of the model 
school is lacking. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
146 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
The success of such a plan depends upon the class- 
room teacher with whom the teacher in training is 
placed. If she is modern, progressive, and up-to-date 
in educational theory the example she sets will be well 
emulated by the teacher in training. Usually the 
classroom teacher is designated as a critic teacher only 
after the officials of the teacher training institution 
are satisfied as to her ability. Using such a plan of 
practice teaching enables a teacher training institu- 
tion to place its novice teachers in actual classroom 
situations in various sections of its territory under 
varying conditions. Thus some teachers in training 
may be placed in city graded schools, others in con- 
solidated rural schools, and still others in one-room 
rural schools. If all this training is under the immedi- 
ate supervision of expert, experienced teachers, sup- 
plemented by frequent visits from the director of 
student teaching in the teacher training institution, 
a much better result will be obtained than is usually 
secured in a model school. 
No school of education would consider sending out 
its graduates without some period of observation and 
practice teaching. While the forms of this are many, 
the principle is the same: that prospective teachers 
should have some experience in a situation similar to 
that in which they will be expected to teach. How 
much time, in proportion to the length of the entire 
course, should be spent in such observation and prac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
       THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 147 
tice teaching is not standardized. In some instances 
requirements of the State Department of Education 
determine it. In others merely the available amount 
of time is the determining factor. It seems reasonable 
to expect that some observation—at least two periods 
in each grade—be made during the first year of the 
student teacher’s professional training. Such observa- 
tion as a part of an orientating course m education is 
most desirable. Actual participation in classroom 
teaching may well be deferred until the last year of 
the student teacher’s training. Such participation, 
either in the model school or in a classroom in a neigh- 
boring city or town, should occupy her entire time for 
a period of nine or ten weeks. This includes such con- 
ferences with the classroom teacher and director of 
student teaching as may seem advisable to the persons 
concerned. There is much need for the standardization 
of work in this field of observation and participation.

       CHAPTER VIII 
DISCIPLINE 
There is scarcely any factor more important to the 
success or failure of a teacher than her ability to govern 
and control her class. A teacher may be a brilliant 
student, she may know subject matter, she may have 
studied under renowned teachers, but if she is unable 
to control her class successfully, promotion in the 
teaching profession is not for her. One of the prin- 
cipal questions asked a teacher and those who recom- 
mend her by a superintendent who is considering 
adding her to his teaching staff is, “Is she a good 
disciplinarian?” 
Discipline as a school problem—Why is this prob- 
lem of discipline so important? Why do we have it 
at all? As long as we have had schools we have had 
unruly pupils. As long as we shall have schools, we 
shall find some disorderly pupils. The attitude on the 
part of teachers and of parents is a factor in school 
discipline. The attitude of some teachers is reflected 
in the remark of one teacher who said, “We’d have a 
pretty good school if it weren’t for the children.” 
And the attitude of parents is reflected in the universal 
manner in which teachers are discussed and criticized 
149 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
    150 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
in the presence of children. When we arrive at the 
place when all pupils are convinced that for the time 
being the most important thing in the world is the 
securing of an education and when parents and 
teachers alike bend every energy to this end, then our 
disciplinary problems will be largely past. 
The concept of discipline—The concept of discipline 
varies. With some teachers it means absolute quiet. 
“JT want it so quiet in this room that I can hear a pin 
drop.” To others it means sitting in a position with 
one’s hands folded on the desk in front of him when 
the school tasks are over. To such teachers discipline 
and rigidity are synonymous. To most teachers such 
a concept of a well-ordered room is entirely foreign. 
Doctor Bagley’s definition of a well-disciplined 
school—Doctor Bagley has given us a remarkable 
definition of a well-disciplined school. He says: “A 
well-disciplined school is one that is characterized by 
a fashion of codperation, order, and industry.” It 
is a remarkable definition that is likely to stand for 
all time, as it includes the practice of modern teaching 
methods as well as those which may be developed in 
the future. The virtue of the definition lies in the 
word “fashion.” When we can develop a spirit of 
morale that makes for its own order, we have accom- 
plished our aim. A foreman entering a busy factory 
can tell by the noise and hum whether the machinery 
is working all right. An experienced teacher can step 
into a classroom and detect good order by the hum
-P-A-G-E-161
DISCIPLINE 151 
of work, even though the room is in apparent con- 
fusion and disorder with project work. The modern 
teacher does not insist upon quietness as an essential 
to order. On the other hand, needless noise is not to 
be tolerated. But the hum of workers busily engaged 
in school work is not to be considered undesirable 
merely because it is noise. A well-disciplined school 
is not conscious of the machinery of discipline; every- 
one is orderly simply because it is the spirit and 
fashion of the institution to be so. This fashion is 
transmitted to the newcomer not through word of 
warning, but through actions and general conduct. 
“That sort of thing is not done here” is the implication. 
Discipline as the result of planning—Undoubtedly 
discipline must have some machinery behind it. A 
well-disciplined class never just happens; it is always 
the result of definite planning on the part of the 
teacher. The machinery should not be apparent to 
pupils, but nevertheless it is there. This implies then 
that the teacher must have a plan of discipline if she 
is to be a successful disciplinarian. 
The fundamental law of discipline is: Plan defi- 
nitely for discipline and then carry out your plan. 
A number of years ago Hon. William Howard Taft 
told the following incident of his teaching days. As 
a principal of a school in the New England States he 
had trouble in controlling the boys. They persisted 
in doing certain things contrary to the regulations he 
had set. Finally he delivered an ultimatum. If one 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
boy was caught violating a regulation he was to be 
sent home. Of course, in such a case there is always 
the individual who is going to see if the teacher really 
means what he says. So it happened that one boy 
transgressed. Mr. Taft discovered him and asked him 
if he had done thus and so. Yes, the boy had. Didn’t 
he realize that he would be sent home for the viola- 
tion? Yes, he did. Now it happened that the boy 
was the son of the president of the board of education. 
But Mr. Taft, undaunted, sent him home. As he left, 
the boy made this last remark, “Well, you may have 
the power to expel me, but I’ll tell my dad and he’ll 
get you.” True to his word, the son reported to his 
father and it was not long before Mr. Taft was in- 
formed that the president of the board of education 
wished to see him. When they met, the president 
berated Mr. Taft soundly; he called him every name 
he could lay his tongue to and finally ended by saying, 
“You seem to have the idea that you can do just as 
you please around here.” To which Mr. Taft replied, 
“Sir, your manner is rough, and your language is un- 
couth, but you’ve grasped the idea.” 
The point to be gained from this incident is that 
when once the teacher has formulated a plan, that 
plan must be carried out regardless of whom it may 
affect. It may be the son of the president of the board 
of education; the daughter of the leading banker; or 
the children of the richest merchant in town. No 
   
-P-A-G-E-163
  DISCIPLINE 153 
matter who it may be, a plan of discipline must be 
applied to all equally, fairly, and without favor. 
The wise teacher will carefully consider the prob- 
able effect of her plan upon pupils before announcing 
it. A certain teacher of a second grade announced 
that any pupil found whispering would be shut up in 
the supply cupboard, a small dark room leading from 
the classroom. All went well for a while until a little 
girl was caught and when the teacher attempted to 
carry out her plan the girl began to cry, her classmate 
cried, and as a result the teacher did not carry out 
her plan. In this case the plan was not a wise one 
and the teacher should have foreseen the probable 
result. It is a serious mistake to threaten and then 
not to carry out your threat. 
In a certain high school a number of the boys were 
found matching quarters in the coat room. They were 
warned. In reply the boys said, “We don’t see any- 
thing wrong about it. Our fathers do the same; they 
go to the club and play billiards or pool or bowl and 
’ then match to see who pays for it. Our fathers do 
not object to our matching quarters.” 
There was only one reply the principal could make 
and that was that so long as they were members of 
the student body of a public school the practice could 
not be tolerated; even though they and their parents 
did not consider it wrong, that petty gambling had no 
place in school and its influence upon other members 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
of the student body might be detrimental. To back 
this up, the principal told the boys if any of them 
were reported again he would suspend the offending 
individuals. 
It was not long before one boy was seen matching 
coins. The principal promptly suspended him. The 
boy had just about time to reach his home when the 
principal was called to the telephone. The following 
conversation took place between the boy’s father and 
the principal. 
“T understand you suspended my son from school 
this morning.” 
“Yes, sir, that is correct.” 
“For matching quarters?” 
“That was the offense.” 
“If you do not reinstate my son in school by to- 
morrow, I shall see to it that you are separated from 
your position.” 
Now it happened that this man was very influential. 
A man of some repute, he stood very high in the eyes 
of the community. He was wealthy, talented, and 
successful. Nor did the principal wish to lose his 
position. And yet, here was a clear-cut issue. Should 
he give in to the insinuation or should he stand for 
right? He thought quickly in the next few seconds. 
“Mr. X, I have no doubt that you have the influence 
to secure my dismissal. I shall stand by my decision. 
Your son may return to school when he promises to 
obey our regulations. If you do carry out your threat   
-P-A-G-E-165
DISCIPLINE 155 
and secure my dismissal, I am going to buy the front 
page in the newspaper published in this city for 
advertising purposes. If I am fired I am going to tell 
on that front page just why I was fired. If you want 
to do anything, go ahead.” 
The principal hung up the receiver, nothing more 
was heard from the father. The boy came back to 
school and was a model student from that time on. 
How easy it would have been to have given in to 
“mfluence”! A plan once formulated must be carried 
out. 
The teacher “in loco parentis’—The classroom 
teacher is confronted with the situation of controlling 
her class during the recitation periods, on the play- 
ground, and in many states while going to and from 
school. It is no easy task then to control a group of 
pupils; obviously the teacher cannot be present all 
the time, and at these times the ideals and attitude 
developed will be the controlling factor in discipline. 
We shall consider discipline from the viewpoint of 
the development of habits and attitudes, and also disci- 
pline as directly administered by the teacher. 
Development of disciplinary habits and attitudes— 
Every teacher would like to teach a group of children 
who are responsive to suggestion, orderly in conduct, 
and obedient to her command. Every teacher may 
have such a group, providing she is willing to work 
for it. Wishing will not secure it, but hard work will 
bring it every time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
The personality of the teacher; factors—The first 
factor in developing disciplinary habits and attitudes 
is the teacher’s personality. Personality is an elusive 
thing. We speak glibly enough about it and we recog- 
nize the individual who has a good personality, but 
when we attempt to define it we find ourselves at a 
loss. The personality of the teacher has been the 
subject of much investigation and inquiry, and from a 
study of the results of such investigations we find that 
the following elements enter most strongly into the 
personality of the teacher. 
1. Sympathy. 
. Patience. 
. Enthusiasm. 
. Fairness. 
. Cheerfulness. 
. A sense of humor. Qo rr © 
Sympathy. These qualities of personality are 
largely self-explanatory. The sympathy a teacher has 
for the members of her group must be a real sympathy 
with their problems. Pupils are quick to see through 
a false or pretended sympathy. The teacher will do 
well to cultivate that quality which will encourage the 
pupil to confide in her. Without this sympathy the 
teacher will be abrupt and unfeeling and the pupil is 
quick to see and quick to resent this. 
Patience. Patience and still more patience is re- 
quired of every teacher. The teacher may patiently 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
DISCIPLINE 157 
teach and drill and drill until she is sure her pupils 
know, and in two days’ time or less it may all be for- 
gotten. Patience with the pupil in the learning process 
is a prime requirement of all teachers. Without it 
balance is lost, the teacher is cross and unreasonable, 
and the class becomes unruly. 
Enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is one of the most con- 
tagious elements in the classroom. If the teacher is 
enthusiastic, her class will be. If she is not, her class 
will be dull, stupid, and troublesome. A teacher must 
be truly enthusiastic before she can beget enthusiasm 
among her pupils. It cannot be forced and be suc- 
cessful; it must be genuine. But what a power it is! 
Through it class work becomes a pleasure instead of a 
task. 
Fairness. To be fair is an absolute requirement of 
all teachers. It is an essential element in the teacher’s 
personality. Pupils are ready to recognize fairness 
and quick to resent unfairness in the teacher. The 
teacher must stand firmly for right and in so doing 
treat all pupils alike. To have favorites and grant 
privileges to some and not to others should not be 
tolerated for one moment by the teacher. Severeness 
in a teacher can be condoned by the pupil if the teacher 
is fair. To the teacher who has the quality of fairness 
there will come a loyalty from her students that will 
be worth much in controlling the class. 
Cheerfulness. The cheerful teacher radiates a 
quality in the classroom that dispels all gloom and 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
makes work easier because of it. The out-of-doors 
may be dark and gloomy, but inside there is cheer and 
brightness. Through her cheerfulness the teacher 
conditions her room. Any pupil would prefer work- 
ing with a cheerful teacher in a room made bright by 
her cheerfulness, than with a teacher whose tempera- 
ment changes with the weather. Teaching personality 
needs this factor. The lives of many children are drab 
and dark, and the only cheerfulness that enters their 
lives comes in the classroom. 
Sense of humor. A sense of humor saves many a 
situation in the classroom. The teacher who has it 
as a part of her personality will be saved many a diffi- 
cult problem. Teaching is a serious matter; a teacher’s 
equipment needs to have some light touch of humor 
in it to prevent looking upon teaching as all serious 
work. Many a situation may be saved from becoming 
a troublesome disciplinary problem by looking at its 
humorous aspect. The teacher should be sure, how- 
ever, never to laugh at pupils, but she may with pro- 
priety laugh with them. 
The teacher as master—Granted then that the 
teacher possesses these qualities of personality and 
many more, we can see that the control of her class 
will be through the personality she possesses, rather 
than by any direct method. In the old-time school 
the teacher was called the master. He was master in 
every sense of the term. His desk was on a platform 
raised above the level of the schoolroom floor. Over   
-P-A-G-E-169
DISCIPLINE 159 
his head, against the wall, hung a bundle of switches, 
symbols of his authority. In many cases he was 
obliged to prove his authority by proving himself the 
physical master of his older pupils. He was monarch 
of all he surveyed. He was master by the right of 
might. 
The teacher ruling her class by force of her per- 
sonality does so indirectly, constantly presenting an 
attitude of orderliness, which her pupils are gradually 
taking over and making their own. In the primary 
grades, with the child an imitator, this takes place 
rather easily and quickly. In the upper grades it will 
take place more slowly. 
Keep the pupil busy—The second factor in develop- 
ing those habits and attitudes which make for order 
is found in keeping the pupil busy. Any teacher hav- 
ing difficulty in discipline can change the entire atti- 
tude of her class by keeping them busily engaged in 
interesting work. If a class gets disorderly, it is likely 
to get out of hand. A change of work, written work, 
blackboard work, or the like will quiet the class. But 
the teacher who employs this as a means should con- 
sider it just that. There is little or no educative value 
in the work done under such circumstances. The fact 
remains that only the pupil who has time to be dis- 
orderly, is disorderly. The busy pupil is never a 
disciplinary problem. 
To keep the child busy involves careful planning on 
the part of the teacher so that the pupil’s interest is 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  
  160 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
aroused and his attention fixed on the work to be 
done. A pupil will not give his attention to that in 
which he is not interested, nor can we expect his 
interest to be aroused unless the teacher has enthusi- 
astically planned the class work and communicates 
her enthusiasm to the class. The project, the social- 
ized recitation, the use of life situations in problems 
solved in the classroom will do much toward the 
arousal of interest and securing of attention. 
A boy who had become a real problem to his teachers 
because of his propensity for being disorderly was 
promoted by the principal in mid-term to the grade 
above. The effect was remarkable. The effort of the 
boy to keep up with the class kept him so busy that 
he did not have time to become a disciplinary problem. 
In this case a superior pupil was kept at tasks too easy 
for him, and he needed the stimulation which comes 
from effort. 
Mental control—The third factor in the develop- 
ment of habits and attitudes of discipline is that which 
we may call the teacher’s mental control. A teacher 
who has not planned her lesson, who has no real 
method of teaching, but trusts to the inspiration of 
the moment, who is careless in her conduct of the class, 
has but herself to blame if her group becomes dis- 
orderly. 
The teacher must show by her attitude that she 
expects order and to this end she will conduct the class 
with vigor. Vigorous drill and rapid questioning will 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
DISCIPLINE 161 
bring a class up to a rigorous mental work. The 
teacher may often not feel vigorous, she may be tired, 
worried or nervous, but there is no excuse for a 
teacher to scold and be ill-natured in the classroom 
because of her personal feelings. The pupils are not 
responsible for her ill nature and should not be made 
to suffer because of it. The teacher in the classroom 
must be vigorous in order to stimulate vigor. The 
weakling is usually at a disadvantage and pupils are 
quick to notice it. 
When a teacher begins her class enthusiastically 
and keeps every member of it alert and her enthusiasm 
communicates itself to the group, we have an eager 
class of working pupils with whom there is no possible 
thought of disorder. The teacher secures obedience 
because her attitude shows she expects it and the 
response she gets from her class is in proportion to 
her expectations. Look for trouble and it will be 
found. The battle of discipline is half won if the 
teacher goes before her class confident that she is able 
to handle it. If disorder does begin, a look, a word, 
is usually sufficient to quell it before it has really 
started and long before any damage is done. The class 
does its work without unnecessary commotion, because 
the teacher is master of the situation at all times. 
The development of habits and attitudes is a slow 
progress, which should be distributed over a period 
of time. It cannot be accomplished all at once, and 
a forced growth will not be substantial. There must 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
    162 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
be time for the idea to take firm root and for the ideals 
to become a part of the life of the pupil. 
The controlling influence of these desirable habits 
and skills is not available in all classes and the teacher, 
until such time as they are fully developed, must 
resort to other means of control. 
Active control of disciplinary problems—Active 
control of the class involves on the part of the teacher, 
a directness of method in handling her class. It may 
range from speaking quietly to a pupil to the inflicting 
of corporal punishment. The teacher is actively at 
work suppressing disorder, and in many instances 
literally “sitting on the lid.” In classes controlled in 
this way there is an atmosphere of suppression, of 
intensity and of effort. The situation may often arise 
in which direct control may be necessary, but not in 
case the teacher uses the development of habits and 
skills as a means of discipline. 
Devices of active control—The following methods 
of active control are available for the classroom 
teacher. 
Personal interview. Often the teacher does not 
understand the reason for outbreaks of disorder. 
Especially is this true if the teacher fails to see and 
hear whatever is happening in the classroom. Much 
of the petty disturbances of the classroom may be 
overlooked by the teacher, but she should never neg- 
lect seeing or hearing anything that looks like disorder. 
A personal interview with the person or persons in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
rn nee 
DISCIPLINE 163 
volved give the teacher an opportunity of getting the 
student’s point of view. Incidentally it will promote 
a closer relationship between teacher and pupil which 
will often clear difficulties and misunderstandings be- 
tween them. 
If such method of control is used it is important 
that the teacher control the interview. She should 
terminate it before her sympathy has carried her too 
far. Many a pupil has escaped punishment through 
his ability to “work the teacher.” It is essential, there- 
fore, that the teacher know the situation and keep it 
entirely within bounds; otherwise, this method will 
defeat the very purpose for which it was used. 
Catharsis. This method of active control is men- 
tioned by many writers on discipline. Its use is 
exceedingly rare. The principle involved—of doing 
a thing until one gets heartily sick of it—is correct in 
theory, in practice there is a question. Good judg- 
ment must be used in determining the cases in which 
the method may well be used. We scarcely would 
keep a pupil in after school and make him smoke, 
because that is likely to confirm him in the habit 
rather than to break him of it. Nor would we say to 
the truant that he should run away from school as 
much as he wished. That would confirm, not break 
the habit. On the other hand, there are some cases of 
discipline that can be controlled in this manner. The 
boy or girl who is “funny,” if kept after school and 
compelled to go through his stunts, will not have such   
 
-P-A-G-E-174
164 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
a great desire to show off in the classroom. One 
teacher, reports that she kept a boy after school 
who was continually swearing around the building 
and made him swear for a half hour. He became 
ashamed of himself and was bothersome no more on 
that score. In an actual situation which came under 
the author’s observation, two boys who were always 
fighting on the playground were kept after school and 
provided with boxing gloves and made to fight a series 
of rounds under supervision. They were kept at it 
until they were heartily sick of fighting, and as a result 
gave no more trouble on the playground. With par- 
ticular types of disciplinary problems this method will 
prove effective. 
Attractive activities. It has been proved in count- 
less schools that they can be made so attractive that 
children will want to go to school, and more, that they 
will be orderly and obedient while there. Imagine the 
average classroom, dull, bare, not a thing in it to re- 
lieve the dismal effect of pictureless walls and a barn- 
like atmosphere. It is not surprising that pupils of 
such a school would rather play truant and go to the 
attractive movie theater than to remain at school. 
Our schools in general are not attractive; they are 
quite the contrary. We make the surroundings of our 
prisons more attractive than we do our schools! 
The attractive school—Even if the school itself is 
most unattractive, the classroom teacher can add to 
the attractiveness of her own room. A single flower 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
DISCIPLINE 165 
on the teacher’s desk has worked a complete change 
in attitude and conduct of a class. Even the teacher’s 
dress plays an important part in this control. A touch 
of something new is noticed by the children. Teachers 
make the mistake of wearing clothes “good enough 
for school.” 
Then the class employing projects, socialized recita- 
tions, excursions, and the like will have so many 
interesting, absorbing activities that no pupil will wish 
to miss them, but will want to participate in them. 
Here is an excellent chance for the enterprising teacher 
to solve her problems of discipline. The teacher will 
reduce her problem of discipline to a minimum who 
plans interesting activities for her group and makes 
them so attractive that every pupil will desire to be 
present to participate and incidentally to be obedient 
and docile. 
Types of punishments—More problems are actively 
controlled by threats of punishment than in any other 
way. Punishments inflicted in school range from 
keeping the pupil after school to the inflicting of cor- 
poral punishment. It will be our purpose to examine 
the common forms of punishment in order to point 
out those which can profitably be used by the teacher. 
Keeping the pupil after school—Keeping the pupil 
after school is perhaps the most common form of 
school punishment. It is used for all offenses, both 
great and small. There are some cases of discipline 
in which it would be natural to keep the pupil after 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
school. For example, if he has been tardy or a truant 
he should be kept to make up the time lost, but the 
same punishment should not be used for the boy who 
throws a paper wad across the room. 
Punishment is used either for the purpose of inflict- 
ing pain or for the purpose of correcting the fault. 
It is in the latter sense that we use punishment in 
school, with the hope that the offense will not be 
repeated. Keeping in after school will not deter the 
boy from throwing the paper wad; it might, the boy 
who played truant. In other words, our punishment 
to be effective must fit the crime. 
Disapproval of the group—Perhaps the most effec- 
tive punishment that can be devised is group dis- 
approval. No pupil will perform a disorderly act if 
he knows the group disapproves. His life in school 
and out would be miserable if he violated this natural 
law by which his actions are largely governed. 
Direct. To secure this disapproval is a serious 
matter requiring considerable thought. The teacher 
must be aware of the “tabus” of the group in order 
to use this punishment effectively. To this end some 
teachers try to place the pupil in a ridiculous position, 
and so we have a whole host of punishments, stand- 
ing on the floor in front of the class, standing in a 
corner, for a boy to sit with a girl, or vice versa, 
sitting at the teacher’s desk, the use of the dunce stool 
and cap, and many others. These punishments are 
used largely in the hope that the group will effectively 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
DISCIPLINE 167 
shame the offending individual so that he will not 
repeat the offense. 
Indirect. A wise teacher will carefully consider the 
use of any of these devices. Then she will discard 
them in favor of that more subtle disapproval which 
comes from the group, unspoken, but potent, when 
a member is in disgrace. The wise teacher will also 
safeguard the child from too severe punishment from 
the group. Whenever a group undertakes to punish 
one of its members, there is likely to be too harsh 
treatment as the result, unless the teacher tactfully 
supervises the punishment. 
Separation from the group—lIf a group spirit and 
consciousness has been well developed, a well-defined 
and meaningful punishment will result from the sep- 
aration of the offender from the group. Sending the 
pupil from the room is not desirable, as that may be 
just what the pupil desires. To send a pupil to the 
principal is not an effective means of discipline for 
that indicates that the teacher herself is not able to 
take care of her own problems of discipline. The 
principal will not be kindly disposed toward that 
teacher who sends all her disciplinary problems to him 
for solution. Separation from the group does not 
mean transferring one’s disciplinary problems to 
another. In its simplest form separation from the 
group means non-participation in the activity of the 
classroom. To permit the group to dramatize a story, 
but not to utilize the ability of the offending indi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
vidual is a punishment that will not be repeated twice 
for effectiveness. If the room permits, to require the 
offender to sit in a section of the room where he will 
be isolated, no one in front of him or in back or at 
either side, will be an effective means of punishment. 
In primary grades it is sometimes effective to have the 
pupil put his head down on the desk in his arms. That 
withdraws him from the class activity and is a punish- 
ment to him. Usually but a few punishments of this 
type will secure prompt attention and obedience from 
pupils. 
Appeal to parents—There are many situations in 
school life in which parents and teachers can well work 
together. The home should always be an ally of the 
school. Dangerous tendencies of pupils noted at school 
can be corrected by home influence. So while the 
home may be a powerful aid to the school, the teacher 
must not expect it to take over the disciplinary control 
of the pupil. No mother can send her son to school 
and be responsible for his good conduct while he is 
there. It is the teacher’s job to control him and the 
home influence is important only in so far as it backs 
up the school. If the home does not confirm that 
which the school is attempting to do, it is almost 
useless for the teacher to depend upon any assistance 
in the development of correct habits and attitudes of 
order. On the other hand, every possible appeal 
should be made to the home. Parent-teachers’ asso- 
   
-P-A-G-E-179
  
DISCIPLINE 169 
ciations open the way to a fuller codperation between 
home and school. The danger in such organization 
often lies in the fact that the very individuals who 
ought to belong for the benefit both home and school 
can derive from the contact, do not, and those who 
need it least are the individuals we find at every meet- 
ing. Home and school organizations to be effective 
ought to include all the parents of all the children. 
It is a question then as to the extent to which appeal 
to parents can be used as a form of punishment. In 
homes upholding a high ideal of obedience it would 
be a severe punishment for a pupil of that home to be 
reported to his parents for school delinquency. It is 
not wise nor effective to threaten a child—“TI’ll tell 
your father” attitude should not be used by the 
teacher. But if a boy is caught smoking around the 
school house, or swearing, or lying, a quiet talk with 
his parents and then both parents and school working 
together to break the habit willbe found to be an 
effective means of discipline. The teacher must use 
her good judgment and common sense in this; the 
point to be emphasized is the codperation between 
home and school. A most desirable result is to report 
a pupil’s delinquency to his home and have the home 
punish him and the school do nothing. It is not the 
purpose of the teacher to have the pupil punished at 
home, usually this means a whipping, but her purpose 
is to secure reinforcement to her own plan of discipline. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
    170 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
Ridicule, sarcasm, contempt, irony, are mentioned 
only that the teacher may be warned never to use 
them. 
Corporal punishment—The most common type of 
punishment in our public schools in bygone days was 
whipping. The master of the old-time school whipped 
if a pupil was tardy, if he whispered, if he failed in 
his lesson, if he misbehaved in any way, the punish- 
ment was a whipping. We do not rule our schools by 
physical force any more. Yet there are undoubtedly 
some schools and some school situations in which a 
whipping is the only means by which a pupil can be 
brought to a realization of order. And the boy or girl 
who is not brought up to obey in school is likely to 
develop into the citizen who does not obey in society. 
Yet, it is not to be recommended that teachers use 
corporal punishment. Try everything else. Try it 
twice. Then as a case of last resort use corporal 
punishment. If corporal punishment is used always 
notify the parents of your intentions and administer 
it in the presence of witnesses. Many a teacher has 
caused herself a great deal of trouble by not observing 
these simple cautions. By observing them the teacher 
removes any temptation on the part of the pupil to 
falsify in his version of the account. Very often the 
home will take over the actual punishment and if the 
teacher is sure of this it may at times be wise to permit 
the home to do so. 
Discipline is impersonal—School discipline is an 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  DISCIPLINE 171 
impersonal affair. It should always be considered as 
such. The teacher will save herself many a heartache 
if she will just take this point of view. Children have 
misbehaved in school ever since there have been 
schools. They whisper whenever there is an oppor- 
tunity and all cases of disorder in the classroom depend 
upon the opportunity and the probable effect of being 
caught. Pupils are not disorderly because you are the 
teacher; they will be disorderly with any teacher if 
the opportunity presents. 
The point of view of considering discipline as an 
impersonal affair will assist the teacher materially in 
disciplining her class. She can view each problem of 
discipline as a detached problem with herself as judge. 
The situation then is handled as an impersonal matter, 
and justice, unbiased by personal motives, metes out 
the punishment. 
Disciplinary problems are all similar—Because 
discipline is impersonal we find children doing all sorts 
of things in school very similar to or exactly like those 
which have been the problem of every teacher. Once 
in a while we find a new problem—at least it appears 
to be new. Investigation shows that it is but a varia- 
tion of a problem as old as our schools. So we have a 
whole host of typical disciplinary problems which a 
teacher is called upon to solve. Many of these prob- 
lems, because of their similarity, may be grouped to- 
gether and general principles of control pointed out. 
An investigation into the typical disciplinary prob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
lems of a classroom brought the following to light: 
sullenness, fighting, talking, laughing, writing notes, 
passing notes, chewing gum, talking back to the 
teacher, being smart, snapping rubber bands, tardiness, 
truancy, humming, singing, copying, throwing chalk, 
tripping other pupils, smoking, swearing, snowballing, 
mental deficiency. A glance at these problems will 
show a natural division into two parts. One group of 
problems deals with the class as a whole, and the other 
group with the individual. Following this natural 
division we find they separate as follows: 
Typical disciplinary problems— 
Class problems. The usuai class problems to be met 
in the classroom are whispering, laughing, writing and 
passing notes, tripping each other, snapping rubber 
bands, and similar disorders. The success of these 
plans depends upon the class participation and appre- 
ciation. The teacher must be keen to see and hear 
everything that occurs in the classroom in order to 
prevent slight disorders becoming worse. 
Whispering. This is a common disorder found in 
our classrooms. It often comes as the result of the 
sternness of the teacher in requiring each pupil to 
sit in position and not talk unless called upon to 
recite. There should be some means provided whereby 
pupils may talk with each other in a natural way in 
order to solve mutual problems. In the working of a 
project and in the socialized recitation opportunity for
-P-A-G-E-183
         DISCIPLINE 173 
this is provided. It is natural for the child to desire 
to talk with his classmate. During a study period it 
is not desirable. Sometimes a look, a word of caution 
or warning from the teacher is sufficient to check talk- 
ing. If it is not, the withdrawal of some privilege is 
usually sufficient punishment. The ideal to set up 
in this situation is that a pupil must not interfere 
with his neighbor. He must be courteous and only 
when free opportunity is given should he talk or 
whisper; at other times the rights of others are to be 
respected. 
Notewriting. In many schools this form of disorder 
amounts to a veritable epidemic. It usually starts’ 
about the fourth or fifth grade and continues through 
high school. There is a real reason for note writing. 
The child at the age of 9 or 10 wants to do things for 
himself. The only opportunity he has for writing is 
in the handwriting class or in writing a composition. 
His urge to write is frequently expressed in a note 
which he composes and flips across the room. The 
solution to note writing is frequent opportunity of 
writing. The project of post office will often relieve 
the situation and correct the practice. In breaking 
this habit some teachers require the pupil detected in 
writing or passing notes to come before the class and 
read the note. In some other cases the teacher reads 
the note to the class. This is needlessly humiliating 
to the pupil and should not be used as a punishment.
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
It is well enough if the pupil detected is required to 
deposit the note in the waste paper basket. The 
teacher who keeps her class busy and gives some oppor- 
tunity for expression of the urge to write will have 
little difficulty with note writing. 
Laughing and giggling. Laughing is serious only as 
a class problem. Laughing and giggling are contagious, 
and if the teacher has a number of pupils in the class 
who are prone to laugh or giggle, there is likely to be 
a disorderly class. If the teacher has but two or three 
pupils who seem to be leaders in this, to separate them 
and place them in different corners of the room will 
solve the problem. In any case to separate the gigglers 
is about the only solution of the problem. 
Other problems. Often boys and girls will cause 
disorder in the classroom by humming in a low tone, 
snapping rubber bands, sticking a long pin in a crack 
in the seat and causing it to vibrate, and through 
many similar ways vex the teacher. Usually this is 
done in a sly way when the teacher is not looking. The 
solution of this sort of problem is simple. All that is 
required is to catch the individual once. He carries 
on these disorders because it can be done on the sly; 
often while he is vibrating a pin he will be looking at 
the teacher with the most innocent gaze. Acquired 
innocence is his stock in trade, and once exposed, he 
will stop. 
Sometimes the teacher is obliged to go to great 
lengths to find the offender. It is worth while to do so 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  DISCIPLINE 175 
for its wholesome effect upon the individual and the 
class. In a certain school a pupil of this type put an 
inkwell full of ink in another boy’s coat pocket. Of 
course, when the boy inserted his hand in the pocket 
it overturned and stained the coat. About this time 
the teacher discovered the difficulty and inquired the 
cause. When he discovered the facts in the case he 
demanded the name of the individual who put the 
inkwell in the boy’s pocket. Here was where he made 
his mistake. He demanded and his attitude was one 
of compulsion. The reaction of the class to this was 
aggressiveness; the more the teacher stormed and de- 
manded the name of the guilty party, the greater was 
their determination to shield him and not tell. So in 
spite of his efforts the teacher was not informed who 
the culprit was. At last he dismissed the class with 
the announcement that they were to return to his room 
after school. So after school they all filed in, sullen 
and determined not to reveal the identity of the guilty 
one. In understanding the plan we must realize that 
the boys had had an opportunity of talking with their 
fellows and as a result all the members of the class 
knew who had put the inkwell in the boy’s coat pocket. 
Upon meeting the class the teacher merely made the 
remark that they were to stay there until they con- 
fessed. The class remained silent, sullen, defiant. The 
teacher sat at his desk and thus they glared at each 
other for half an hour. After three-quarters of an hour, 
   
-P-A-G-E-186
    176 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
the teacher called one of the boys to his desk and 
showed him a seating plan of the room thus: 
  
  
  
  
    
    
      
x x

“Now,” he said, “I dislike to keep all of you boys 
here. I know many of you are working after school 
and staying here means a loss of money. I would like 
to dismiss some of you if I could be sure to dismiss 
only the innocent. Look at this seating schedule and 
tell me the rows you think I could safely dismiss.” 
So the pupil looked at the chart and marked the 
rows as indicated. The teacher told him to take his 
seat. 
After a brief interval the teacher called another 
boy to his desk and told him the same story and asked 
him to indicate the rows that might be safely dis- 
missed. But he had turned the chart so that it was
-P-A-G-E-187
  DISCIPLINE 177 
now at right angles to its former position. It was 
marked as indicated. 
  
  
  
    
  
    
  
        
  
      
  The next step of the teacher was to put the two 
charts together and, drawing the intersecting lines, 
said to the occupant of that seat, “John Smith, why did 
you put that inkwell in Warren’s pocket?” John stood 
up and said, “Sir, how did you know?” 
This incident indicates the extent to which a teacher 
must sometimes go in order to catch the guilty parties. 
But once the person is caught it stops his propensity 
for doing similar acts and its effect on the members 
of the class is salutary. 
Individual problems—In addition to the problems 
noted above there are many that affect the individual 
only and touch the class but incidentally. Among the 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  178 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
common ones are swearing, smoking, talking back to 
the teacher, chewing gum, truancy and tardiness, copy- 
ing, and similar acts. 
Smoking and swearing. The pupil who swears or 
smokes around the school building is a real menace 
to his classmates. Once in a while we find a pupil who 
swears not only on the playground but in the class- 
room. Sometimes he is unconscious of being wrong. A 
pupil coming from a home in which that mode of ex- 
pression is commonly used will use it at school without 
a thought. The teacher’s problem then is to ascertain 
the home conditions of such a pupil. The same holds 
true for the pupil who smokes. If either of these prac- 
tices do not have the sanction of the home, codperation 
with the home should be resorted to in order to break 
the habit. In case no support can be expected from 
the home, the teacher’s task is more difficult. As 
reported before, one teacher cured swearing by the 
method of catharsis, but this is not to be recom- 
mended in the case of smoking. In some instances a 
quiet talk with the individual and a quiet but firm 
stand taken by the teacher against such practices will 
at times be effective. One teacher broke up smoking 
by an object lesson. Taking a tumbler full of water 
in which he had placed a small goldfish, he blew a 
mouthful of tobacco smoke into the water through a 
glass tube. As a result the fish died. This object 
lesson was sufficient to impress upon young minds that 
tobacco smoke contained a poison capable of killing.
-P-A-G-E-189
  DISCIPLINE 179 
There will be some cases in which, apparently, all 
means will fail. No teacher is obliged to submit to an 
intolerable situation and a report of the case to higher 
authority will be the next step on the part of the 
teacher. 
Talking back to the teacher. Talking back to the 
teacher should never be tolerated. Drastic punish- 
ment should be inflicted upon such pupils who indulge 
in this. It may be in anger, or it may be deliberate, 
but in any case an apology is due, and if such “back 
talk” was in the presence of the class the apology 
should be public. Refusal to apologize should be met 
with suspension from school until the pupil recognizes 
his error and is willing to rectify it. This situation 
calls for some resolution on the part of the teacher. 
She must be firm to insist upon the apology in order 
that the pupil may form some ideal of social usage and 
a feeling of social obligation and consciousness. 
Chewing gum. A common habit of pupils in school 
is to chew gum. It is not surprising that they do so. 
As a nation we spend many thousands of dollars for 
chewing gum. The child innocently chews gum in 
school unaware that there is anything wrong in the 
act. Therefore, if the teacher finds the habit common 
among her pupils a frank discussion of the habit is 
the first step to take. This is to be followed by an 
effort to develop a social ideal in which chewing gum 
has no part. Persistence in chewing gum after this 
effort should be punished by requiring the child to 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
destroy his gum—throwing it in the waste paper basket 
or in a similar way. This habit may require constant 
vigilance on the part of the teacher for a while, but 
it will pay in the end. 
Truancy. Truancy is usually a solitary crime. 
While it is true we sometimes find a group “skipping 
school,” for the most part this type of offense is prac- 
tised by the individual alone. It is not surprising that 
pupils are truants. Our unattractive schools have still 
fewer attractive activities to hold the attention and 
interest of the pupil. Truancy is easily and simply 
cured, If we can so control the activity and environ- 
ment of the child so as to keep his interest centered 
in attractive school activities, we have solved the 
problem of truancy. Most pupils like school until the 
fifth or sixth grade is reached. Here, unless some 
definite steps are taken, is the customary outbreak of 
truancy. 
The movie as a factor in truancy—In those sections 
of the country where the neighborhood movie throws 
its glamour of romance over its young patrons, we 
may expect that our truant will be found therein. No 
less potent is the appeal of woods and fields to the 
country boy or girl. In spring we find that the pupil 
is impelled by some inner urge to wander, and as a 
result we have truancy. The wise teacher will take 
into account all these factors in combating truancy; 
she will permit expression of the urge to wander by 
taking her pupils on hikes, excursions, and visits to 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  DISCIPLINE 181 
various industrial concerns. Nearly every locality has 
some point of historical interest which may be visited 
with profit by teacher and pupils. 
Avoiding truancy—The solution of the problem of 
truancy depends largely upon the ability of the teacher 
to provide attractive activities which will serve to keep 
the pupil in school. A recognition of child nature is 
imperative. We can force a child to attend school, 
but such a procedure is not likely to create in him a 
liking for school or much respect for education. 
Tardiness—Tardiness is handled in much the same 
way as truancy. In some instances it arises from much 
the same causes as truancy. Playing on the way to 
school, watching an interesting activity, loitering on 
the way are some of the causes of tardiness. The solu- 
tion is best which involves the development of a habit 
on the part of the pupil and which depends upon the 
disapproval of the group as punishment. A depend- 
able, prompt, ready-for-business individual is the ideal 
the teacher should set up. 
Means: of securing better attendance—Various de- 
vices may be used in achieving this idea. Contests 
between classes for perfect attendance is one such 
device. The teacher should be careful not to reward 
perfect attendance by early dismissal from school at 
the end of the week. To do this is fostering the prison 
idea—the sentence is shortened for good behavior. 
The award of an attendance banner to that room or 
grade which makes a perfect record is more desirable. 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  182 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
If the award of such banner is made at the public 
assembly, so much the better, as it then serves to stimu- 
late the entire school. Competition for such an award 
is one of the few competitions in which the entire 
school can meet on an equal basis. 
There are many other devices which may be used 
by the teacher to stimulate promptness. The purpose 
of all of them is the same, that is, the development of 
a habit that will function in school life and in adult 
life as well. 
In spite of the teacher’s well meaning attempt to 
establish this habit there will be some pupils who 
seemingly are not reached by the device and for whom 
the odium of their classmates’ disapproval means 
nothing. For them also there is no interest in school 
activities and seemingly they are not reached by any 
effort of the teacher. In the face of this situation the 
teacher should not be discouraged. It sometimes takes 
a long time to discover the particular interests of a 
pupil. The teacher may even despair of ever finding 
it; but it is there and once found enables the teacher 
to hold the pupil. 
James was such a pupil. School did not interest him, 
and no amount of coaxing, scolding, or pleading had 
any effect upon him. For the opinion of his classmates 
he cared nothing. He was lawless and played truant 
most of the time. The teacher could secure no 
parental support; the family was shiftless and exer-
-P-A-G-E-193
DISCIPLINE 183 
cised no control over James. The truant officer 
brought him to school, but at the first opportunity he 
ran away again. He was about to be brought to the 
juvenile court as an incorrigible when the teacher 
asked for one more chance. It was granted. The 
teacher noted that James spent most of his time at 
the docks with the fishermen. Whenever he was a 
truant he was sure to be found with some fishermen, 
either in their boats on the lake or around the docks. 
In a conversation with James the teacher asked him 
if he would like to prepare a map of the lake he knew 
so well and on it indicate the various localities in which 
the different fish were caught. James was eager to do 
this, and the teacher supplied him with the necessary 
materials. For days James worked on his map. He 
worked at nothing else and often would leave the class- 
room without permission to gain some needed informa- 
tion from his friends, the fishermen. In a short while 
he would return and continue work. At last the map 
was finished. James’s joy was unbounded when the 
teacher asked him if he would explain his map to 
the group. A period was set aside for this and eagerly 
James explained the map and its meaning to the class. 
Here was an industry of which the pupils were all 
aware, but the extent or importance of which they 
knew nothing. As a result the class was interested, 
and asked James a great many questions. 
This was the beginning of the making of James. 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
    
184 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
Through his interest in fishing the teacher secured his 
interest in school subjects and eventually secured his 
complete reform as far as truancy was concerned. 
The interest of the pupil as an aid to discipline— 
It is worth while to discover the interests of pupils. 
They form a valuable aid to the solution of many 
school problems, of which discipline is but one. Once 
having discovered this interest the teacher is enabled 
to use it as the basis of school work and the establish- 
ment of habits and attitudes so desirable for good 
citizenship. The boy or girl who is not interested in 
school will promptly become a problem; finding the 
interest is half the solution. 
The “hopeless” pupil—But what shall be done with 
the pupil who is hopeless? Failing to find his interest 
after investigation of his home life and consultation 
with his former teachers, it is a real problem to know 
what to do with an individual. About the only re- 
course a teacher has in such a case is to see that the 
attendance law is obeyed and refer the case to higher 
authorities, but this only after she has tried every 
means in her power to solve the problem. 
Cheating—Copying work not one’s own and pre- 
senting it as original work, as well as cheating in 
examination, is by no means uncommon. The chief 
objection to home work lies in the fact that much of 
it offers an opportunity for copying. The first step 
in this situation is detection of the culprit and then 
canceling all his work. This will not remedy the 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
       DISCIPLINE 185 
situation and the teacher may proceed in two ways. 
One is to require all work from the offender to be done 
in school under the direct supervision of the teacher. 
The other is to establish an ideal of fairness and 
honesty. The latter is suggested in the case of the 
pupil who is a first offender and gives promise of doing 
better in the future. Perhaps he is not aware of the 
enormity of his act and a quiet talk will assist him in 
the establishment of desirable ideals. If he cannot be 
reached by this method, then the teacher must insist 
upon supervising all of his study periods. This means 
extra work for the teacher, as some of this must be 
done after school hours unless supervised study periods 
are provided. Because of this the solution suggested 
will not be used by some teachers. It is worth while, 
however, and often is the only solution of the problem. 
Cheating in examinations presents many different 
propositions. The cheating may consist merely of 
looking on someone else’s paper or it may involve an 
elaborate “crib,” such as smuggling in parts of the text 
book, writing on strips of paper that can be easily 
concealed, and the like. It is the duty of the teacher 
to detect every attempt to cheat. The teacher should 
be suspicious of the class in examination without 
appearing to be so until she is sure of them. One or 
two experiences will enable the teacher to know what 
the probable situation will be under certain conditions. 
How to avoid cheating—The first duty of the 
teacher is to talk over the situation with the pupils,
-P-A-G-E-196
art ee ee a eRe ene one 
186 FIRST BOOK - EDUCATION 
explaining that fair play and honesty are the ideals 
for which they should work. It is important that 
every possible opportunity for the development of 
morale be utilized. When we have the morale of the 
class fully developed it will be an effective barrier to 
a continuation of the practice. The development of 
these ideals will take time; it is not conceivable that 
they can be affected at once; consequently the teacher 
has the problem to meet and handle until it is safe to 
trust to the pupils’ sense of right. A removal of all con- 
ditions that might be conducive to cheating is recom- 
mended. If it is impossible so to seat pupils that they 
cannot copy from one another, the teacher might give 
different problems or questions to alternate rows, or 
in extreme cases each pupil might be given a different 
set of problems to solve. It is poor educational prac- 
tice for the teacher to be on guard like a policeman; 
it is true she should be alert to detect any possible 
outbreak of dishonesty, but at least there should not 
be the external symbol of authority stalking around 
the room during an examination. 
Again, in some cases merely placing pupils on their 
honor solves the problem of cheating. When a pupil 
understands that the teacher trusts him and has confi- 
dence in him, he will respond to that trust and will 
be more severe with himself in not betraying that 
confidence than if the teacher were standing guard. 
The pupil’s viewpoint is simply this: if he can cheat 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
DISCIPLINE 187 
while the teacher is watching him that is all right, for 
it is the teacher’s function to catch him. 
Punishment for cheating—When there is a clear-cut 
case of cheating detected by the teacher, punishment 
should be inevitable. Here the impersonal attitude 
must be assumed. The crime is not against the 
teacher, but against the group. The proper procedure 
is for the teacher to take the group into her confidence 
and whatever punishment is given should be given 
in the presence of the group. For example, a con- 
fession of the act and an apology to the class would 
be a proper punishment for a first offense. Cancela- 
tion of a pupil’s papers and a zero grade is a proper 
punishment as it does not permit him to profit by his 
cheating at the expense of the other members of the 
class. When the “fashion” of morale of the class is 
plainly against cheating and a pupil is detected in the 
act, it is proper to permit the class to decide upon the 
proper punishment with the right of veto vested in 
the teacher. 
The moral pervert—A serious disciplinary problem 
arises when a moral pervert is detected as a member 
of the group. Usually such an individual goes unde- 
tected for a long time, and his unmasking comes as the 
result of accident. If an honest effort to change his 
attitude is not effective, there is but one remedy and 
that is suspension from school. The influence upon 
the other pupils should be the deciding factor. Our 
   
-P-A-G-E-198
     
188 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
public schools are not places in which moral looseness 
can be tolerated, and any evidence pointing toward it 
should at once be probed by the teacher. 
The authority of the teacher—The extent to which 
a teacher’s authority extends is usually limited by law 
or local regulations of the board of education. The 
teacher should acquaint herself with these provisions. 
In some States corporal punishment is forbidden by 
law; in others it is permitted in the State, but limited 
by local board regulations. In many States the teacher 
is responsible for the conduct of pupils going to and 
from school. Undoubtedly this increases the responsi- 
bility of the teacher, but it also gives her control over 
a situation which might be intolerable. In most cases 
trouble on the way to school or on the way home can 
be avoided by dismissing grades at different times. 
Then the lower grades should be dismissed before the 
upper grades. In case the trouble is not between 
grades but between members of the same grade, the 
teacher may solve her problem by keeping the trouble 
makers in school until the others have had an oppor- 
tunity of reaching home before they are dismissed. 
It is a wise procedure to codperate with the home so 
that pupils are required to report at home immediately 
school is over. This done they are free to do as they 
please. This procedure relieves the teacher of all 
responsibility once they have reported at home and 
for this reason is urgently recommended. 
Disturbances on the playground—At times the   
-P-A-G-E-199
       DISCIPLINE 189 
teacher will be annoyed with disturbances on the play- 
ground coming from pupils who return there after 
reporting at home or from individuals who are not 
connected with the school. In either case the teacher 
has no real authority. Her status is now that of any 
citizen. It is her duty in protection of State property 
to report any damage or intention of damage and 
insist that the civil authorities of the community con- 
trol the situation. Wherever possible the teacher 
should befriend the out-of-school individual. In many 
instances the school grounds are the only available 
playground space for the community. If the teacher 
can be on friendly terms with the group who come 
there for play, much more can be accomplished than 
through adopting an antagonistic attitude. Instances 
have been known of such groups assisting materially 
in providing playground equipment. However, there 
should be the very clear understanding that the privi- 
lege of using the grounds depends upon the behavior 
of the group. 
The importance of discipline—A consideration of 
the problem of discipline makes apparent the reason 
why it is so important in our public schools. A study 
of the elements involved show why school authorities 
place a premium upon the services of the teacher who 
is a good disciplinarian. But a discussion of the prob- 
lems and the formulation of principles alone will not 
make a good disciplinarian of any teacher. There 
must be a willingness to face problems, plenty of
-P-A-G-E-200
190 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
“nerve” and confidence in one’s ability in order to 
insure the keeping of order in the classroom. The 
teacher’s state of mind is half the battle. If the 
teacher shows by her attitude that she expects obedi- 
ence, in nine cases out of ten she will get it, but once 
let her indicate a position of uncertainty or weakness 
and she is lost. Pupils are keen in judging a situation, 
and if they once see a suspicion of weakness they will 
immediately take advantage of it. 
The problem of discipline is universal—Every 
teacher has to meet the problem of discipline and the 
method used, the attitude assumed, and the manner 
of disciplining are important elements in handling 
a class. The novice can gain much from observing an 
experienced teacher control her class. The experienced 
teacher learns much from each new class she teaches. 
The only point at which a teacher can safely relax is 
when the class is thoroughly socialized and the 
“fashion” of good order firmly established.

        CHAPTER IX 
MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT 
Ever since schools have been established there have 
been in existence various methods for the purpose of 
measuring the ability of pupils. The examination is 
the most common of these methods, and its use is 
almost universal. For a long time, its value was not 
questioned and we find that promotion in school work 
depended entirely upon success in an examination. 
It is apparent at once that an examination may be 
difficult or easy, it may be general or specific, it may 
require thought or mere tabulation of facts. There is 
no way in which we can judge or compare the work 
done in two grades, using the teacher’s examination as 
a criterion. 
Distribution of pupils on basis of achievements in 
school subjects—In the chapter on Individual Differ- 
ences we discovered that within a class, pupils divided 
themselves with respect to mental ability in accordance 
with a very definite law. It is equally true that pupils 
separate into similar groups with respect to ability in 
any school subject, such as arithmetic, spelling, hand- 
writing, etc. This fact is of tremendous importance 
to the teacher, for, by applying the measuring stick she 
193
-P-A-G-E-204
    194 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
can discover these groups for herself, and also compare 
her work with that done in any other grade in her 
own school system or that of a distant city. 
The standard test—The measure by which this is 
done is the standard test. The entire field of standard 
tests divides itself as follows: 
I. Intelligence tests. 
II. Achievement tests. 
a. Scales. 
b. Tests. 
The intelligence tests—The intelligence tests are 
those tests which measure the amount of native ability 
a pupil has. It is not the purpose of this chapter to 
defend or condemn the intelligence test. Undoubtedly 
it is a very crude measure at present; undoubtedly it 
has great possibilities and we shall see in the next few 
years great improvement in it. Just as a geologist can 
predict the possibility of finding oil in a certain locality 
by examining the strata of rock below the surface, 
samples of which are brought up by the drill, so the 
psychologist by tapping various strata of mental re- 
action is enabled to predict the mental ability or in- 
telligence of the child. 
The normal child—A child who is six years old, that 
is, he has lived in the world for six years, and whose 
mind is capable of those reactions a six-year-old child 
should make, is called a normal child. In order to dis- 
cover the reactions that a six-year-old child should
-P-A-G-E-205
MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT 195 
make, a great deal of experimentation is necessary. 
A series of tests are given to a sufficient number of 
six-year-old children so that the normal curve of dis- 
tribution holds and what is accomplished by the middle 
or average group is called the norm or standard for 
six-year-olds. A single individual coming up to this 
norm is then considered normal; if he does less, he is 
subnormal, and if more, superior. With this in mind 
it is easy enough to understand that a child who is 
six years old physically may be only four years old 
mentally or seven or eight years old mentally. In 
other words, physical age and mental age do not always 
go together. 
Intelligence quotient—To express the relationship 
which exists between physical age and mental age we 
use the Intelligence Quotient. As its name implies it 
expresses the relation which exists between physical 
and mental age, in which the mental age is the dividend 
and the physical age, the divisor. Thus 
6 years old mentally 
6 years old physically oe 
6 years old mentally 
3 years old physically 6 years old mentally 
12 years old physically 501. Q. = 2001.Q. 
1.Q. therefore forms a basis of division into groups. 
The normal group 90-110 I.Q. Those below 90 are 
considered feeble-minded and those above 110 superior. 
The Binet-Simon test—The original work along this 
line was formulated by Binet and Simon in France. 
   
-P-A-G-E-206
  196 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
Their work was standardized and arranged for Ameri- 
can children by Dr. Terman. Today the Stanford 
revision of the Binet-Simon intelligence test is the best 
known and perhaps the most reliable of all the intelli- 
gence tests. Its chief disadvantage lies in the fact 
that it can be administered only by a skilled operator 
and is an individual test—that is, only one pupil can 
be examined at a time. The student is referred to 
“The Measurement of Intelligence” by Terman for a 
complete description of this test. 
The group intelligence test—To provide a more 
rapid means of ascertaining the intelligence of groups 
of pupils there has come into use a great number of 
group intelligence tests. For the most part these have 
their genesis in the army psychological tests which 
were devised to group the men in the army according 
to intelligence. Some of them are good, while a great 
number are manifestly formulated to sell. Of these 
group tests, among other good ones we may mention 
the Mentimeter test by Trabue and the Thorndike 
group intelligence test for high school graduates as 
two outstanding, dependable intelligence tests that can 
be used to measure large groups of pupils at one time. 
Use of the intelligence test—Regardless of what 
type of intelligence test is used there is a distinct ad- 
vantage in being able to group children in classes on 
the basis of mental ability. In fact, in many of our 
modern school systems progressive superintendents are 
using the intelligence test as a basis for grading. Thus   
-P-A-G-E-207
  MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT 197 
all pupils of approximately the same intelligence are 
placed in the same group. With this scheme the 
teacher can apply the best method of instruction to 
fit the particular group she is teaching. This type of 
procedure is also valuable in discovering exceptional 
ability or the lack of it. There is no valid reason why 
a child should remain in one grade a whole year if he is 
able to do the work of the next higher grade. Terman 
reports a case of an entering pupil who was in the 
first grade at the opening hour of school and in the 
fourth by noon of the same day. Without some means 
of measurement it is unlikely that his progress would 
have been so rapid. On the other hand there should 
be no hesitancy in demoting a pupil who upon measure- 
ment is found to be below normal. 
The intelligence test has come to stay; it is no longer 
a fad; and while we find instances of its use because 
it is the “fashion” to do so, thoughtful teachers are 
finding in them a means, not an end. When first 
formulated and introduced many extravagant claims 
were made for them; at present we find them used 
largely for their diagnostic value, and upon their find- 
ings classification of pupils and methods are based. 
Achievement tests; scales and tests—The achieve- 
ment measures are of two kinds, scales and tests. The 
scales are few in number and consist of a series of 
samples arranged in their order of excellence. A hand- 
writing scale consists of a series of handwriting samples 
arranged in order from the poorest to the best. Usually 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  198 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
the arrangement depends upon the combined judgment 
of a number of judges. In the Thorndike handwriting 
scale a number of competent judges arranged the 
samples in order independently and when 75% of them 
agreed upon the position of a sample in the series, it 
was given that place. The other scales in use depend 
upon the judgments of various judges for the arrange- 
ment of samples in the series. 
Scales—The use of scales is simple although the 
disadvantage lies in the fact that the judgment of the 
teacher enters into its use. If the teacher has samples 
of handwriting collected from a grade, she takes one 
and compares it with the samples of the scale, moving 
it around until she finds a sample nearest like the 
student’s sample. To confirm her judgment it is now 
compared with the sample on the scale which is one 
step poorer; the student’s sample should be better than 
that. It is next compared with the scale sample one 
step better; the student’s sample should be poorer. 
If this comparison survives all these comparisons, it 
is given the rating of the scale sample. If it does not 
meet these tests, it is compared further until it does. 
The procedure in the use of all scales is the same. 
Elimination of personal judgment—In order to 
eliminate the factor of the teacher’s judgment as much 
as possible, it is customary to have three judges rate 
the same paper individually and then take the middle 
rating for the final mark. If the three judges rate 8, 
10, 7, individually, the paper is rated at 8, as this is
-P-A-G-E-209
  
MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT 199 
the middle score of the three. It is surprising to dis- 
cover that teachers will rate very closely together, 
in many cases all three judges giving the same value 
to the sample. Especially do we find this to be the 
case after the teacher has had considerable experience 
in grading papers with the scale. Therefore, for a 
rough measure by the scale, no great harm is done if a 
single rating by a teacher experienced in using the 
scale, is used.

Once a pon a time there was a girl. One day she asked me what 
I was going to do next Saturday so I said, “I am going to go for 
a swim.” And she said, “thats 
just where I am going to”. next Saterday came we both went 
down together. We came home at noon time. after dinner we 
went to the picktures. There we had a good time. And then came 
home at night.

I would like to go out in the after noon and play catching the 
ball. Go over to Bertha’s house and have a few girls to come with 
me and be on each others side. I have a tennis ball too play 
with. The game is that one person should stand quite aways from 
another person and throw the ball too one then another. Some- 
one has to be in the middle and try too get the ball a way from 
someone then she takes this persons place who she caught the ball 
from. Then till every person has a chance.

Next Saturday I should like to go away and have a good time on 
a farm. I should like to watch the men plowing the fields and 
planting corn, wheat, and oats and other things planted on farms. 
Next Saturday I will go to the Pioneer meeting if nothing hap- 
pens so that I cannot go. I should like to go swimming but it is 
not warm enough and I would catch a bad cold. I should like to go 
to my aunts and drive the horses, I do not drive without some 
older person with me, so I cannot go very often. 
I should like to see my aunts cat and her kittens, too. I think 
I can, to.

and will have lunch together, then they are going to the Hippo- 
drome. After the Hippodrome, they are all going home to dinner to 
one of the girls houses, she lives on Riverside Drive so they expect 
to take the “Fifth Avenue Bus” up there. The evening will be 
devoted to playing games, singing and dancing.

If I had a thousand dollars to spend, I think I would take a trip 
to San Francisco by train with the rest of the family, and stop at 
a sea side hotel. It would be glorious to see the surf again, and 
to escape from the cold blustering weather of December for the 
balmy breezes of the ocean, and the whiff of orange blossoms. 
We could take long drives under shady trees, visit the orange 
and olive groves and bathe in the surf. Think of the bathing in 
the ocean in December! 
Coming home again I should enjoy stopping at Yellow Stone 
Park. It would be lots of fun to camp out, and to ride over the 
prairies on frisky ponies. It would be very interesting to notice 
the change of climate as we got farther east, and to go to bed on 
the train one evening feeling warm, and waking up the next morn- 
ing feeling very chilly. 
I am afraid by the time I would get home a thousand dollars 
would be pretty well used up; but if not I would like to give a 
party.

One Sunday, towards the end of my summer vacation, I was 
in bathing at the Parkway Baths. In the Brighton Beach Motor- 
drome, a few rods away, an aviation meet was going on. Several 
times one of the droning machines had gone whirring by over our 
heads, so that when the buzzing exhause of a flier was heard it did 
not cause very much comment. Soon, however, the white planes of 
“Tom” Sopwith’s Wright machine were seen glimmering above the 
grandstand. Everyone stood spellbound as he circled the track 
several times and then headed out to sea. He was seen to have 
a passenger with him. Suddenly, the regular hum of his motor was 
broken by severe pops, and the engine ran slower, missing fire 
badly. In response, to Sopwith’s movements, the big flier tilted 
and swooped down to the beach from aloft like an eagle. The 
terrified crowd made a rush to get out of the way as the airship 
came on, but Sopwith could not land on the beach, but skimmed 
along close to the water instead. Suddenly his wing caught the 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  202 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
water, and the big machine somersaulted and sank beneath the 
waves. The aviators soon came bobbing up, and were taken away 
in a launch, but the accident will not soon be forgotten by those 
who saw it.

The courage of the panting fugitive was not gone; she was game 
to the tip of her high-bred ears; but the fearful pace at which she 
had just been going told on her. Her legs trembled, and her heart 
beat like a trip-hammer. She slowed her speed perforce, but still 
fled industriously up the right bank of the stream. When she 
had gone a couple of miles and the dogs were evidently gaining 
again, she crossed the broad, deep brook, climbed the steep left 
bank, and fled on in the direction of the Mt. Marcy trail. The 
fording of the river threw the hounds off for a time; she knew by 
their uncertain yelping, up and down the opposite bank, that she 
had a little respite; she used it, however, to push on until the 
baying was faint in her ears, and then she dropped exhausted upon 
the ground. 
Scales used for everyday ratings—Scales can be 
used in rating everyday work of the pupil. A teacher 
who rates a composition by one of the composition 
scales will rate that same composition six weeks later 
in the same way and give it the same grade. This 
points the way to the elimination of the personal equa- 
tion in rating papers. A teacher’s judgment is biased 
by the appearance of the pupil, his deportment; she 
marks high when she feels good, and low when she has 
a grouch. The scale is an impartial judge unaffected 
by any of these elements. 
The pupil’s use of the scale—The scale can safely be 
placed on the wall of the schoolroom and the pupil 
permitted to see the point to which he has progressed 
and the progress he has made. Pupils will be more 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
       MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT 203 
eager for improvement if they can see the comparative 
improvement on the printed scale itself. When this 
method is used the teacher can mark her papers with 
values as given on the scale, and the pupil will under- 
stand and recognize it. Incidentally this is more satis- 
factory to the pupil because it is virtually a definition 
of the teacher’s rating. Without definition a teacher’s 
80% one month may be equivalent to her 90% 
another. 
A scale which may be used to great advantage by 
children in rating their ability is the handwriting scale. 
Samples from such a scale are shown below.

are an effective motivating device and from this view- 
point alone are valuable aids in classroom teaching. 
The values assigned to the samples on the scales 
depend upon the position of comparative value given 
them by the majority of competent judges. The tests 
are not so constructed. An arithmetic test of ten 
problems is graduated in difficulty from the easiest 
problem to the most difficult with the difference be- 
tween any two problems equal, not on the basis of 
judgment but on the basis of actual achievement. Thus 
the problems are given to a large group of pupils in 
order to ascertain just what problems are more difficult 
than others, and the final arrangement depends upon 
this finding. There is more opportunity of accurate 
placing by this method, and it is perhaps for this reason 
that we have more tests than scales. Certainly it is a 
more scientific method of ascertaining the difficulty 
of achievement.

This scale shows us a series of problems ranging 
from the easiest to the most difficult, separated from 
each other by steps of equal difficulty. The next 
problem is to see how far a pupil can go in solving 
the series. A sufficiently large number from the same 
grade are tested so that the normal curve of distribution 
may hold, and the middle value (median) taken as 
the norm or standard for that grade. These are found 
for the various grades and remain as the standards 
for these grades in the subject matter of the test. Any 
pupil taking such test is rated with respect to this 
standard median and is designated as being below 
the median or above the median for that grade. 
Definition of median—The norm or standard for any 
grade is expressed in terms of the median. Briefly 
defined the median is that point at which there are 
as many above as below. If we should arrange five 
pupils in their order of excellence from the poorest to 
the best, thus: 1—2—3—4—5, 3 would be the median 
for there would be two better and two poorer. In the
-P-A-G-E-221
  MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT 211 
same way if we arrange the papers from a class in order 
with the poorest on top and the best below, and then 
pick out the middle paper, the score on this paper may 
be taken as the median. In more accurate work there 
is a method of arithmetical computation which gives 
the median without any manipulation of papers. Any 
good book on statistical methods describes this method 
as well as other measures necessary for complete treat- 
ment of scores achieved. However, the teacher will 
find that the median is the most commonly used of 
these measures. 
The three elements of the standard test—Every 
standard test has in it three elements, that is, time, 
quantity, and quality. The administrator of the test 
controls two of these elements in order to measure the 
third. Thus we give the pupil a series of ten problems 
(quantity) to solve as many as possible (quality) in 
a given period (time). 
Directions for giving achievement tests accompany 
each and the teacher is cautioned to give the tests 
exactly according to directions. Many a test is in- 
validated by not observing this. If results are to be 
comparable, the conditions under which the test is 
given must be exactly the same in all cases. 
Availability of tests—At the present writing, scales 
and tests are available in all school subjects in prac- 
tically all grades. They are not difficult to give and 
with some study and practice the classroom teacher 
can make available for herself this very effective means 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  212 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
of checking the achievements of her class. Tests are 
to be given not merely for the sake of being in style 
but for their diagnostic value. A teacher who gives 
a test and has before her the list of pupils in her grade 
with the score made by each one, the median of her 
class and the standard median, is able to compare 
the class as a whole through the class median with the 
standard median, but above all is she able to tell where 
each member of her group stands in comparison with 
every other member of the class as well as the standard 
median. If the tests are to be a diagnostic means in- 
stead of an end in itself, the teacher will begin to 
ascertain the reason why certain members of her group 
are below the median and how she can best assist them 
in achieving better. 
Comparative results—The standard test is an ob- 
jective means of showing to the teacher the compara 
tive results obtained from the use of two methods. 
A new method of approaching a subject may be sug- 
gested; a teacher may be skeptical regarding its value; 
application of a standard test will demonstrate whether 
the new method is as effective as the old. This puts a 
weapon in the hands of the teacher. She may desire 
to try some new method and may even do so without 
consulting her superiors. Criticism of her use of the 
method may be definitely checked by application of a 
standard test. 
Discovering the progress of the pupil by the stand- 
ard test—The most usual use made of tests is to dis-

cover whether a pupil is making normal progress or 
not. A test given at frequent intervals will enable 
the teacher not only to ascertain if progress is being 
made, but also how much. For each pupil to keep a 
graph showing his progress at each successive period 
and for the teacher to keep a class graph showing the 
amount of progress the class has made will be found 
to be useful devices in stimulating endeavor. Many 
teachers display the class graph in the classroom where 
it can be seen by the class all of the time; this practice 
is commendable and is exceedingly effective. 
Practice tests—If standard tests are to serve effec- 
tively they should be supplemented with practice tests. 
Many series of tests are provided with these supple- 
mentary forms. Briefly the practice test is similar 
to the standard test in presenting the same elements 
that the pupil will later meet in the test itself. Such 
elements while identical are not given in the same 
order or combination and serve the purpose of giving 
the pupil an opportunity of testing himself. It is 
hoped that many of the existing tests will add this 
valuable feature. 
False-true test—There is available for every teacher 
in every grade a type of test, which, while it is not 
standardized, affords an opportunity of checking on 
instruction. This test is the false-true test. Briefly, 
a false-true test consists of a series of statements, 
some false and some true. Or, it may consist of a 
series of questions to be answered by yes or no. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  214 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
series should be reasonably lengthy, at least twenty 
statements or questions. Directions to the pupils are 
to mark those statements which are true by a cross or 
the word yes. If each pupil is provided with a list of 
statements this can be done on the paper itself, or 
another form of recording may be used. An example of 
the test and recording form will make this clear.

Each pupil is given a slip of paper as follows: 
On this form the pupil is directed to mark “yes” 
or “no” by putting a cross in its proper place as the 
statements are read by the teacher. The teacher should 
then read each statement but once, and the pupil is 
to mark a cross for each statement whether he knows 
the correct answer or not. In this lies the principal 
objection to the false-true. It does encourage guessing, 
but a record for each statement is essential to the suc- 
cess of the test. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT 215 
Scoring the test—In view of the fact that the ele- 
ment of chance enters into this test some means must 
be used to eliminate it from the score. A pupil who 
knew nothing about the sub- 
ject might mark the record 
sheet haphazardly and might 
indicate some correct answers. 
To provide for this, scoring is 
made according to this for- 
mula: Score = number of 
statements marked correctly |, 
minus number of statements 
marked incorrectly. For the 
sake of convenience the score 
may be found by multiplying 
the number of statements 
marked incorrectly by two and 
subtracting from the total 
number of statements given. 
It is possible in this form of 
test to have negative scores. 
Chief value of false-true test—The chief value of 
the false-true test is to secure the relative position of 
the pupils within the class with respect to a particular 
achievement in subject matter. Its advantage lies in 
the fact that it is easily prepared and can be used fre- 
quently by the teacher. The time involved is short 
and on this score recommends itself to the busy teacher. 
The marking of the test can be simplified by making 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-226
216 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
a stencil to fit the report slips with rectangular slits 
where the crosses should appear. A report slip can 
be corrected at a glance. 
The completion test—A test which serves the same 
purpose as the false-true test is the completion test. 
It was first proposed by Trabue, who developed a 
Language Scale by omitting certain words in sentences. 
The deleted sentences were then given to pupils with 
directions to write one word in each blank, making 
a complete sentence.

Originally used by Trabue to measure language 
ability, the form of the completion test is used ex- 
tensively by teachers to check up quickly and easily 
achievement in school work. As used in the classroom 
the teacher writes, or takes from the text a paragraph. 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT 217 
Certain words are omitted from the paragraph and 
the insertion of the correct words by the pupils indi- 
cates his study of the lesson and ability in it. A sample 
completion test thus used is given below. 
“Whitney, the inventor of the was born in ona 
farm in . From boyhood he showed an intelligent curiosity 
about machinery. In he was graduated from col- 
lege. He wished to study but his funds were exhausted, so 
he went to to teach school. While here he became inter- 
ested in separating cotton from the seed. From this was developed 
a machine destined to change the chief industry of the south.”     
  
  
  
  
  
In this form a typewritten sheet must be given each 
pupil and this may make it prohibitive for some 
teachers to use. 
Thus we can see that the teacher has available a 
wealth of material which will assist her to test her 
pupils. Such testing is far removed from the old- 
fashioned examination. It is safe to say that the 
present-day school teacher can find out actual con- 
ditions in her classroom with respect to the achieve- 
ment of her pupils in one-quarter the time it formerly 
took under the examination plan. More than that, it is 
done easier and with greater accuracy. No longer need 
there be “term examinations” or “finals”; in their place 
a quarter or half hour testing with a standard test or 
a false-true or completion test will tell the teacher as 
much and more than the old method. 
The standard test is here to stay. Its use is becom- 
ing more universal each year as teachers become more 
and more proficient in using it. Our teacher training

institutions are helping by providing elective courses 
in tests and measurements and in many instances 
requiring a course in the subject. Every teacher should 
_ be familiar with the available tests and know some- 
thing of how they are to be administered. In this day 
of modern education she cannot afford to be ignorant 
of this means of checking upon instruction.

  CHAPTER X 
HOW CHILDREN LEARN 
Necessity for a knowledge of child nature—The 
old-time school selected first the textbook and then 
proceeded to fit the child to the subject matter as 
therein presented. It made no difference that the 
author of the textbook might be far out of touch with 
actual school conditions; the textbook was supreme 
and the pupil was secondary. Our modern school, un- 
der the awakening direction of the new psychology, 
reverses the process. Children are taught, not text- 
books. The process, in addition to being a more scien- 
tific procedure, is more efficient. It is necessary, there- 
fore, that the teacher have some knowledge of child 
nature and of the laws of learning as they apply to 
classroom procedure. The responses which a pupil 
will make in any given situation will depend largely 
upon the age of the child. There are periods in the 
development of the pupil in which various characteris- 
tics make their appearance. Because of this we shall 
consider the age levels of children and point out the 
responses characteristic of the period. 
Pre-school period—Ordinarily the teacher pays little 
or no attention to pre-school experiences of the child. 
221 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  222 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
And yet they are very important. Inherited tendencies 
and abilities are shown very early in the development 
of the child; because of the fact that children react 
differently to different persons this trend of tendencies 
and abilities is not always shown upon entrance to 
school. To a far greater extent than is now the custom 
the teacher should acquaint herself with the life his- 
tory of each child as he enters the kindergarten or first 
grade. The child is largely the result of his experi- 
ences; education builds upon the past experience of 
the child and adds to those he already has. It is evi- 
dent that if the child upon entering school is deficient 
in experience the school must proceed to furnish the 
experience necessary for a basis or background for 
school work. We cannot assume that children entering 
the first grade or kindergarten have had the same or 
equivalent experiences. It is true that there are a 
great many common elements which the majority of 
children have had, but the teacher is not justified in 
assuming that all children in a given class have had 
that experience. The pre-school experiences of the 
child must be, therefore, supplemented, enlarged, and 
extended by situations involving life activities in the 
classroom. 
Mental life of the child—The mental life of a child 
is greatly different from that of an adult and does not 
differ from it in degree only. The child, in growing 
from childhood to adulthood, grows in proportion as 
he is stimulated. The responses the child makes to 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  HOW CHILDREN LEARN 223 
these stimuli depend upon his inheritance from the 
past, or if he inhibits a response which ordinarily 
would be the result of a certain stimulus it is likely 
due to training. Without training a child would give 
free expression to his native, inherited responses when- 
ever a stimulus presented itself. For example, all 
children are born with the stealing tendency. Present 
a brightly colored ball to a baby and he will reach out 
his hands to grasp it. This is the stealing or taking 
response which comes as the result of the proper 
stimulus being presented. 
Original nature—Children are born then with a 
large number of responses which are unlearned and 
which constitute the original nature of the child. The 
problem of the teacher is to accept the pupil with his 
store of responses and to develop some of them and 
inhibit others. Education and training in school is 
for a large part the development of native responses 
and the inhibition of others to the end that the pupil 
may be enabled to take his place in the society of his 
fellows and assume the duties and responsibilities of 
good citizenship. 
The pupil as a problem—Each pupil is a problem 
to the teacher until she is able to apprehend the 
background of experience and heredity he has. Then 
armed with this knowledge she can proceed to develop 
him along the line best suited to his mental ability. 
There is a joy in watching and aiding the development 
of the school child as he unfolds, and the teacher has 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  224 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
a most wonderful opportunity in assisting the pupil 
to acquire mental habits and attitudes. 
Efficient learning—The teacher’s standpoint should 
be one of efficient learning. This involves proper 
mental activity in learning with the least expenditure 
of time and effort for the securing of maximum re- 
sults. Long before the child goes to school he plays, 
“makes believe,” imitates, and is exceedingly curious. 
To the teacher who is a student of child nature at all 
this affords an opportunity to develop habits, atti- 
tudes, and skills by using these activities in the desir- 
able way of developing certain responses and inhibiting 
others—in other words, learning can be effectively and 
efficiently accomplished through games, actions, imita- 
tion of others, and the like. Contrast the modern 
school using these child tendencies with the old-time 
school which set tasks utterly at variance with the 
nature of the child, and insisted upon forcing the child 
to conform to them regardless of child nature. The 
dunce cap has been worn by many a normal child who 
was considered dull merely because no attempt was 
made to adapt learning and teaching methods to his 
mental ability. 
PRIMARY PERIOD 
The animal nature of the child is prominent during 
the primary period of school life. School activity 
should provide plenty of opportunity for physical 
exercise. The child of this age needs opportunity to
-P-A-G-E-235
HOW CHILDREN LEARN 225 
stretch much as a kitten or puppy does. There will be 
found, likewise, a lack of close articulation. Muscles 
and mind will work together but poorly until by re- 
peated practice the muscle responds to the mental 
stimulus. Because of this, motor-sensory activities, 
such as handwriting, drawing, and the like, will be 
crude and for the most part should be large in size 
and should be executed by the larger muscles of the 
arm and hand. 
Rivalry—One of the chief characteristics of the child 
during this period is that of rivalry. It is observed on 
the playground in games of individual strength or 
skill; it is observed in the boasting of the child of the 
powers of his father, or uncle, or big brother; it is 
observed in the pride with which new possessions are 
displayed. Rivalry, because of its personal element, is 
undesirable. Competition, in which the group is the 
unit, is a much more desirable form of activity. The 
wise teacher using competitive devices will adopt re- 
strictive measures preventing the personal element of 
rivalry with its attendant elements of envy, hard feel- 
ings, and discontent to creep in. Unquestionably com- 
petition is a desirable element, and many teachers use 
it in many different ways; it is only when competition 
develops into rivalry that it is undesirable. 
Ambition—The impelling motive behind compe- 
tition may be ambition. Many a child will persevere 
and stick at a task because he is ambitious and de- 
sirous of doing better. His reason for doing better 
   
-P-A-G-E-236
   226 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
may be to outstrip someone else or it may be to secure 
the approval of the teacher or the group, but whatever 
may be the impelling motive it stimulates his ambi- 
tion. The primary teacher is able to develop ambition 
in the pupil by setting before him high ideals and 
standards; the development of attitudes in the child 
will result. 
Sociability—The primary child is essentially social. 
He makes friends easily and conforms readily to the 
social customs and usages of the group in which he 
finds himself. For him, the group of which he is a 
member, constitutes the public. This fact is respon- 
sible for his being surrounded with a countless number 
of tyrannies that are not apparent on the surface. 
Should he appear dressed in a different manner from 
his comrades or use expressions of speech that are 
different, the disapproval of the group is sufficient to 
cause a change. Curly locks, the delight of every 
mother and the abomination of the lad entering school, 
have been responsible for many a heartache too often 
concealed and unknown. The sympathetic teacher 
will protect the child through these troublesome times, 
but should not shield him to the extent that the im- 
port of the experience will be lost upon the child. 
The adjustments which the child must make to con- 
form to the customs of the group may necessarily be 
harsh, and the teacher is called upon to soften some- 
what the conditions of this adjustment, but not to 
the extent of entire elimination.   
  
-P-A-G-E-237
HOW CHILDREN LEARN 227 
Group loyalty—Once the child has found himself 
and his place in the group he will develop an intense 
group loyalty which for the time being overshadows 
all else. The sum total of his experiences are ex- 
pressed in those of the group. The gang has its 
beginnings in this group loyalty, as has also the 
“clique” or “set” of the girl. The social nature of the 
child during the primary period is developing within 
him a desire to be with people—a desire which leads 
later into the attitude of identifying himself with 
various groups—clubs, political parties, churches, etc. 
The primary teacher utilizes this group loyalty in 
many ways in the primary period. It makes possible 
socialized recitations, projects, and problems to be 
undertaken and worked out by groups of children act- 
ing under the combined stimulus of loyalty and 
competition. 
THE INTERMEDIATE PERIOD 
Muscular control—The advent of the child into the 
intermediate period is characterized by a marked de- 
velopment in the control of his muscular movements. 
His handwriting becomes smaller and more defined; 
his drawings are less erratic and more in conformity 
with the principles of pictorial representation. In 
gymnastics the codrdination between muscle and mind 
is firm and decisive. While the transition from thé 
primary period to the intermediate period is charac- 
terized by many changes in the mental and physical 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  228 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
make-up of the child, there is none more apparent than 
that of muscular control. This leads the teacher of 
these grades to attempt better results in sensory-motor 
activities. 
Interest in games—By reason of the increased 
ability to control his movements, the child’s interest 
in games develops. During the primary period the 
child ran for the sheer enjoyment of the act; now 
he uses that power in eluding his classmates, and a 
game of tag results. In a short time games involving 
more skill are tried and enjoyed. Thus there comes 
into being a new experience for the child, one in which 
play, heretofore a joyous, happy time, contains the 
element of competition. In the schoolroom the same 
idea of the game may be carried through. Many an 
element of school work can be taught through the 
medium of play. Not that there would seem to be 
implied a sugar-coated curriculum, but rather that the 
very essentials found so necessary on the playground 
may be utilized also in the schoolroom. The child 
soon learns that games in competition with other 
children demand fair play, honesty, and truthfulness, 
and an indefinite something which he hears called 
“good sportsmanship.” Realizing this development in 
the child the intermediate school teacher has a won- 
derful opportunity to use these same ideals in the 
class work of the child. Moreover, when this is done 
to any considerable extent the pupil will see and 
realize that there is a very definite and vital connec-
-P-A-G-E-239
HOW CHILDREN LEARN 229 
tion between his free period activities and his class- 
room work, and that the common elements in both 
are certain social ideals and personal habits, attitudes, 
and skills. 
Play as a relief from formal school work—There is 
another side to the importance of including play in any 
system of education. The use of play periods in 
dramatization of stories, number games, and competi- 
tive drills affords a relaxation period for teachers and 
pupils alike. All of this together with the playground 
periods and gymnasium exercises affords a most 
valuable means for a symmetrical development of the 
body and mind. 
Play as a means of recreation—Again play is of the 
utmost importance in the later life activity of the child 
in providing a means of recreation. Every activity of 
the child, mental or physical, if persisted in will cause 
fatigue. This fatigue is not fatigue of the whole body, 
but rather is confined to certain parts of it. Play 
offers a relief from the fatigue of the affected part. 
For example, a period of concentration on the study 
of a lesson can be relieved and may be easily accom- 
plished by introducing a play period. In the school- 
room periods of work broken up by periods of play 
will accomplish wonders in the amount of renewed 
energy with which children will attack the work of 
the classroom. Already we find many school systems 
definitely providing for this in the physical education 
program outlined for the classroom teacher. Thus at
-P-A-G-E-240
  
  230 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
regular intervals the plan calls for physical activity in 
the form of a game, semi-formal or even formal gym- 
nastic exercise. 
The construction desire—During the intermediate 
school period boys and girls are engaged in making 
things. The boy is busy with his kite, his bird house, 
or animal trap; the girl with her dolls’ clothes, em- 
broidery, or sewing. Children of this period are easily 
encouraged to make things. This tendency opens to 
the teacher a wide range of projects. The building of 
bird houses, the making of aprons, or the construction 
of some article to be used in the schoolroom, such as a 
cabinet to house a collection made by the group, is a 
most valuable means for the awakening of new capaci- 
ties and new interests. The learning of a list of 
important products produced by a country becomes a 
task of memorization. The making of a product map 
of the same country is not a task but a pleasure and 
serves the same purpose in the fixation of the desired 
facts. To one group observed by the writer, the relief 
of the United States remained an enigma in spite of 
excellent teaching, until they were encouraged to make 
a relief map of the United States as a group project 
on the sand table. 
The extent to which it is possible or desirable to 
encourage constructiveness in the child will depend 
largely upon the teacher and the means at her com- 
mand. Certain it is that construction materials used 
in decorating the schoolroom lead to discrimination in
-P-A-G-E-241
HOW CHILDREN LEARN 231 
form, color, and general utility which is of value in 
meeting a life need of the child. 
Interest in adventure—The child’s interest in ad- 
venture we have previously mentioned. There is 
scarcely an activity containing an element of adven- 
ture which does not make its appeal to the child of 
intermediate school age. It manifests itself in running 
away from home, the intense interest in camping or 
playing Indian, and in playing truant from school. 
This universal tendency is a normal trait—undoubt- 
edly an inherited one from our ancestors. Far from 
suppressing this desire it is better for the teacher to 
direct it into satisfying substitutes. Among these the 
excursion or trip to an interesting factory will be 
found especially desirable. Careful preparation on the 
part of both teacher and pupils is not only desirable 
but necessary if this interest is to be of value educa- 
tionally. If possible the teacher should go over the 
ground first in order to be perfectly familiar with it 
when she is accompanied by the children. Should 
school time not be available or should there be objec- 
tion on the part of parents or school officials, a Satur- 
day morning spent in this activity will well repay the 
teacher for giving up a part of her time. 
Real journeys of this type can lead naturally to 
imaginary journeys made by the children to all parts 
of the country. In this connection, readings, pictures, 
and even the movies can be made the basis for inter- 
esting additions to such journeys. The teacher should 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  
  232 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
not overlook the influence of the movie in the lives 
of children, especially as it relates to this urge. One 
reason why the movie has failed to be of great value 
educationally is largely because the ordinary educa- 
tional picture is devoid of the real elements of 
adventure. The neighborhood movie with its cheap 
and bizarre picture will prove of vastly more interest 
to the child largely because it is full of adventure and 
thrills. If the school movie is to function, it must 
necessarily have more “action” than at present. 
Drill—The intermediate school child is at that 
period in life in which the assimilation of facts is made 
easily. It is largely for this reason that our methods 
in the intermediate grades have been those of drill. 
A moderate amount of drill in these grades is pro- 
ductive of results. It has afforded the teacher an 
easy method to fill the mind of the child with facts. 
Nowhere else will the method secure larger results 
than in these grades. Unquestionably drill should be 
used, but it is time we undertook to relieve drill from 
the monotony which so often characterizes it. To 
this end drill forms which are individual, competitive, 
and interesting are the desirable ones for the teacher 
to use. 
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL PERIOD 
With the onset of puberty there comes to the child 
new interests, new ideals, and new attitudes. In the 
main our fine junior high schools have recognized this
-P-A-G-E-243
  
   HOW CHILDREN LEARN 233 
and have done much to foster and develop them. 
Where this has not been accomplished, it is often the 
result of a misunderstanding of junior high school aims 
and principles. 
Sex consciousness—The most outstanding feature 
of adolescence is the development of sex consciousness. 
Too often this development leads to an unwholesome 
attitude toward life. A frank recognition of it will 
assist the teacher to develop a fine regard for manhood 
and womanhood. It would seem in our modern age 
that we must rely more and more upon internal con- 
trols of behavior which can only come as the resultant 
of indirect teaching. Social grouping and plenty of 
opportunity to work and play together is the solution 
of the problem. 
The discovery of selfi—The junior high school period 
is characterized by the discovery of the individual of 
himself as an entity. In the periods preceding this 
there has been the notion of dependence upon other 
people. Now the child sees more clearly his relation- 
ship to society as a whole and the part he is expected 
to play as a member of the group. This involves in- 
terest in those activities and studies which lead to 
the development of skills which in turn lead to the 
earning of a living. 
In another sense the individual discovers himself 
anew. He finds that social activities are pleasant— 
that he is no longer a child and treated as such, but 
as an individual, now grown up, and that his opinions  
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
have some weight in the family circle and in his school 
group. He commences to find himself, his abilities, 
his limitations, and above all his possibilities. He 
determines to shape his own life, and this determina- 
tion may be crystallized into selection of his life’s work. 
Place of the school in the discovery of self—The 
school may well encourage this development. Stimu- 
lating materials, encouraging talks, and sympathetic 
understanding from the teacher will be of value. 
Especially should the teacher study the characteristics 
and dormant qualities in order that whatever advice or 
encouragement is held out to the child shall be for his 
best academic and vocational betterment. Explora- 
tion of courses of study will fit into this program. 
Talks about the professions, necessary preparation and 
qualifications for entering them, the rewards of such 
undertakings, should be the order of the day. Usually 
successful business and professional men and women 
can be persuaded to come to school and talk to the 
pupils about their own professions. 
New ideals—The ideals of the junior high school 
pupil become fixed, and the type which is adopted de- 
pends upon his home and school training. If he has 
been encouraged from the primary grades to form 
those personal attitudes and if he has also assumed the 
proper social habits and skills he is in a fair way to 
find those ideals of life which will serve him as a guide 
through life. A fine ideal of manhood and woman- 
hood should be one result of such training. High

civic consciousness with a realization of its duties and 
responsibilities is another. In other words, that which 
we usually call character is in the process of formation. 
The junior high school teacher serves best who sees 
in the situation the responsibility for forming these 
habits, attitudes, and skills as well as teaching subject 
matter. Example and precept are important. The 
teacher should be the pupils’ ideal. But such idealism 
should be founded upon real worth and value and not 
upon show and pretense. “Give to the world the best 
you have, and the best will come back to you” is an 
ideal that may well be emphasized in the junior high 
school period. 
How to teach ideals—It is not to be supposed that 
any direct teaching will be attempted to form ideals; 
rather it must come indirectly. The study of litera- 
ture, history, art, music, and in fact any study in 
the curriculum contains possibilities for this to be 
achieved. Great men, great events, dramatic situa- 
tions, the struggle of right and wrong in civil rebellion, 
personal struggles and national uprisings, are depicted 
in literature, music, and paintings. A word here and 
there, an expression of opinion, and a frank discussion 
will be all that is necessary to bring to the pupil ideals 
that will serve for his guidance through life. 
New energies—With the discovery of self and the 
formation of new ideals there comes a tremendous 
unfolding of new energy. A realization of his powers 
and abilities creates a desire to use them, and the
-P-A-G-E-246
  236 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
pupil is eager to put them into immediate practice. 
In his unsettled condition (a characteristic of adoles- 
cence) this desire will be strong one day and weak 
another. He “blows hot and then cold,’ but the 
presence of desire indicates the energy of the man-to- 
be. When the teacher is convinced that this energy 
is to be unloosed upon desirable activities the pupil 
should be encouraged to spend his energy to the 
utmost, but in order that the habit of driving through 
to completion be definitely formed, insistence must be 
made that an activity begun must be finished. 
Project activities are the keys to the problem. If 
the pupil is stimulated to build a radio set, a dining- 
room table, or to identify birds or trees, it must be 
insisted that once begun the activity be completed. 
The world has already too many individuals who are 
enthusiastic over new projects only to drop them when 
a more alluring prospect presents itself. The world 
needs individuals who not only will begin, but will 
carry through and finish. And the energy of the 
junior high school pupil will carry him through to 
completion if proper encouragement is given him. 
Hitherto unknown levels of energy will be tapped and 
used and developed if the pupil is properly handled. 
THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL PERIOD 
The junior high school period sees the birth of new 
thoughts and activities. The senior high school period 
witnesses all these being made a real part of self.
-P-A-G-E-247
  HOW CHILDREN LEARN 237 
More and more responsibility is assumed and delegated 
to the pupil and his reaction to it will be made in the 
light of his previous training and power. The addition 
of increased responsibility carries with it a place in 
society, and the pupil takes his place in the family 
group, the school group, and the church group. 
Function of senior high school studies—To com- 
mand properly his rightful place, the subject matter in 
the senior high school should present the thoughts 
and activities of the race in such manner that they 
may be easily assimilated by the pupil. Cause and 
effect may be studied and reasons for actions and 
events carefully scrutinized in order to form principles 
of thought and action as guides in similar situations. 
Examination of original sources in history; actual con- 
tact with the business and the industrial world and 
the application of school art principles should be a part 
of every study in the senior high school. The active 
participation of the pupil in community and social 
affairs may now be expected, and if the teaching has 
been well done it may be expected that the result of 
this participation will be effective and efficient.

  CHAPTER XI 
EXTRA CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES 
The child’s attitude toward school is likely to be one 
of intense interest while he is in the primary grades, 
but entering upon the intermediate grades his attitude 
is often that of divided interest. School holds for him 
a certain interest, but he begins to realize that out- 
side of school there is a whole field of activity with 
which he has not been previously concerned. School 
begins to be pushed more into the background, and 
instead of school and its activities being the para- 
mount interest in his life, outside-of-school activities 
become more prominent. 
Linking outside with school activity—Just how we 
can link together the activity of the child out of school 
with the educative process is important for the teacher 
to know and understand. Nor is there any danger of 
over-educating the child or forcing certain types of 
activity upon him because of their known value 
educationally. It is perfectly possible for us to corre- 
late both activities in such a way that one will com- 
plement the other. Very often the outside activity of 
the child will indicate to the teacher the means of 
240
-P-A-G-E-251
       EXTRA CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES 241 
approach in school work. The child who is interested 
in poultry raising or a paper route may be shown how 
arithmetic, one of his school subjects, will contribute 
to success in his endeavors. There is no valid reason 
why a pupil’s arithmetic lessons should not concern 
themselves with the real, vital problems connected 
with his out-of-school activities instead of compelling 
him to solve problems in which he has no interest 
and concerning which he is unable to force his interest. 
Any real, red-blooded boy would rather determine the 
amount of cloth it would take for a box kite of certain 
dimensions that he is making than to calculate the 
number of square rods in a mythical field owned by 
the mysterious “Mr. A.” 
Any school activity, initiated by the interest of the 
pupils, ought to carry over into the out-of-school 
period. An interesting story read or dramatized, the 
store project, the building of a bird house, are ex- 
amples. Discussion of land forms in the geography 
class may well lead to finding of some of them in the 
fields nearby. All that is needed in this respect is, 
first, stimulation on the part of the teacher, and 
second, sufficient teacher interest to ask pupils con- 
cerning that which they have seen. If a pupil knows 
that the teacher is interested in what he has found 
outside of school and makes use of his information in 
school, not only will he be eager to observe and report, 
but he will also realize that school and life are inti- 
mately connected.

Organization of hobby clubs—The organization of 
hobby clubs needs careful thought on the part of the 
teacher in order that they may function effectively. 
They provide an opportunity for utilizing the power 
of leadership which has been expressed by pupils on 
the playground and in the classroom. Above all, 
should such organization be simple. Too often have 
clubs and organizations failed and died early deaths 
because of the cumbersome organization tacked on to 
them. When a club has nearly as many officers as 
members, and a half dozen committees in addition, it 
needs no prophet to foretell disaster. In the main the 
purposes of the club will be very well met by having 
a chairman, or president, and possibly a secretary who 
may also act as treasurer if the occasion demands. In 
some instances it will be very wise to have a chairman 
elected at each meeting. By so doing the honor and 
responsibility are passed from one member of the group 
to another. However, in most cases a permanent head 
will give stability and continuity to the work of the 
club. 
The time of meeting of hobby clubs varies consider- 
ably in schools where they have been organized. To 
hold such meetings after school is the general practice. 
It seems wise to call attention to the fact that many 
schools find it possible to set aside one of the regular 
periods once a week for the various clubs. The author 
is acquainted with one school system which set out 
deliberately to provide school time for extra-curricular
-P-A-G-E-253
  EXTRA CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES 243 
activities on the basis that such work was as much 
worth while educationally as the regular class work 
and should be scheduled as such. There are advan- 
tages in such an arrangement. 
Aims of extra-curricular activities—Participation 
in any extra-curricular activity should be for the pur- 
pose of developing leadership in school and later in 
community life and the worth-while employment of 
leisure time and recreation. Membership in any club 
or organization should be purely voluntary, and it is 
wise to set a limit as to the amount of extra-curricular 
activity which may be undertaken by any one pupil in 
order to prevent him from undertaking too much and 
also to prevent him from dominating several clubs 
and thus crowd out others who might develop leader- 
ship. This situation is much too common in our 
schools. A certain boy or girl, because of his ability 
as a leader or because of popularity with the group, 
is elected to direct a great many of the various activi- 
ties of the class. Unquestionably such direction will 
be efficient and effective, but it is also true that such 
practice will result in inhibiting the development of 
qualities of leadership on the part of individuals in 
whom these characteristics may not be apparent. The 
active participation of all members of the groups in 
the activities of the group is the most desirable method 
of securing the development of dormant leadership 
qualities. 
Boy and girl scouts—Among the activities which 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  244 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
are desirable for pupils from the age of twelve up to 
participate in might be mentioned the Boy and Girl 
Scout Organizations as well as the Campfire Girls. 
The boy or girl who is an active member in any of 
these groups is developing qualities of manhood and 
womanhood which will be of inestimable value to him 
in adult life. The teacher of boys and girls of this 
age can serve very acceptably as Scoutmaster or Scout- 
mistress. There is an added value to this. If the boy 
or girl in school has his teacher as scout leader there 
will result a fine spirit of comradeship and companion- 
ability unobtainable by other means. The teacher who 
takes a group of students on a hike has by that very 
act enhanced her value as a teacher. It stamps her 
as a human being ready and willing to enter into the 
activities of youth; to understand youthful ambitions 
and desires; to be of service in out-of-school activities. 
It is safe to say that such a teacher will have much 
less difficulty with discipline than the teacher who 
simply will not be “bothered” with such affairs. 
The very form of scout organization may be helpful 
to the teacher, even if a regular scout troop is not 
organized. A number of schools use the form of the 
organization for the class group. Thus each row is a 
unit with its leader; and the various leaders, together 
with the teacher, form a sort of council before which 
all the activities of the group are reviewed. In this 
way the students control routine affairs such as fire 
drills, passing to classes and assemblies, and all similar
-P-A-G-E-255
  EXTRA CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES 245 
classroom and school routine. In the same way the 
affairs of the hobby clubs are controlled by the council. 
Abandoning hobby clubs—There should never be 
any hesitancy in abandoning any extra-curricular 
activity when it is plainly evident that interest in it 
has passed. This is a comparatively easy task when 
the organization is as simple as that suggested. In- 
terest in a camera club may be exceedingly high for a 
while, then it may gradually pass. This is the time 
to disband the camera club. It has served its purpose. 
Its members now may be interested in stamp collec- 
tions, radio, or birds. The transition to the new activity 
may very well be easily and rapidly made. 
Membership in clubs—In the elementary school 
membership in any club should be purely voluntary. 
Every club should be open to anyone who wishes to 
join. In this way a purely democratic situation will 
result and there will be an utter avoidance of snobbery 
or caste if special qualifications are not demanded for 
membership. The question of dues should receive the 
careful attention of the teacher. They should be 
avoided whenever possible, but if necessary there 
should be a limit insisted upon in order that no mem- 
ber may feel that he may not join because of any pos- 
sible money barrier. On the other hand, membership 
should be denied the individual who is not interested 
or who does not take an active part in the affairs of 
the organization. Non-active membership will do 
more to disrupt a club than any other one thing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
    246 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
Types of hobby clubs—The following kinds of 
hobby clubs may be formed in the elementary school: 
1. Bird Club 10. Attendance Club 
2. Stamp Club 11. Health Club 
3. Dramatic Club 12. Literary Club 
4. Camera Club 13. Radio Club 
5. Travel Club 14. Sewing Club 
6. Colonial Club 15. Woodworking Club 
7. Industrial Club 16. Corn Club 
8. Nature Club 17. Canning Club 
9. Story Club 
The list may be extended indefinitely depending upon 
the interest of the child. The organization of these 
clubs is similar and permits of easy formation and 
abandonment. 
Source of materials for clubs—The busy teacher is 
often at a loss to provide suitable materials for hobby 
clubs. Every club will need stimulation, and while it’ 
is surprising the extent to which children will secure 
information about that in which they are interested, 
yet the teacher should be ready from time to time to 
supply materials the child might not obtain otherwise. 
There are many sources of supply. The commercial 
exhibits sent out by many concerns such as Baker’s 
Chocolate, Shredded Wheat, Pillsbury’s Flour, Dixon’s 
Pencils, Esterbrook Pens, and a whole host of other 
firms, will be found to be of the utmost value for club 
work. The travel club will collect railway and steam-
-P-A-G-E-257
  
EXTRA CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES 247 
ship folders; the stamp club will know every person 
in the community receiving letters from foreign coun- 
tries; the health club will be in touch with the various 
health organizations, such as the Modern Crusaders, 
Junior Red Cross, and the Child Health Organization. 
In short, many available sources for the supply of 
materials will be discovered with just a little thought 
and search. 
In addition to the above suggestions there will be 
found a number of magazines on the market suitable 
for children. Among them The American Boy, 
Boy’s Life, and St. Nicholas may safely be placed 
in the child’s hands and every one contains material 
which can be used in the work of the hobby club. 
There should be no hesitancy in using this material 
in school. The child should be encouraged to bring 
it into the classroom as a contribution to the club 
work in which he is engaged. Only by this means 
can the teacher tie up school activities with outside 
activities. 
The agriculture clubs—The pig club, the corn club, 
the canning club, and other clubs of this type are 
essentially rural in their scope. There are wonderful 
possibilities in such clubs. The boy who grows an 
acre of corn or the girl who cans vegetables she has 
raised herself is engaged in a worth-while activity. 
Usually the State College of Agriculture will give to 
the teacher all the necessary information and materials 
for the organization of such clubs, and in many cases
-P-A-G-E-258
  248 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
will give active assistance. To have a group of boys 
in a rural school raising chickens or pigs or corn, and 
then gathering to exchange ideas in a club meeting 
will help greatly in developing codperation, tolerance, 
and courtesy, as well as learning something about 
scientific agriculture. In addition there are wonderful 
opportunities for the teacher to point out the necessity 
of knowing the school arts (reading, arithmetic, and 
other school subjects) in order to carry out the project 
in its fullest sense. Again this shows the pupil the 
necessity for education in the world of work. Inci- 
dentally it shows the parents the practical need of 
education and its value on the farm. 
Athletics—The extent to which athletics will count 
in the extra curricular activities of the school will de- 
pend largely upon the size of the school. It will not 
function much before the sixth grade and probably not 
before the junior high school, merely because the 
child’s development does not include group or team 
games before that time. If in these grades the group 
is large enough it is desirable to form some athletic 
teams. 
Football should not be thought of, although soccer 
may be indulged in without harm. Of all athletic 
sports basket ball is the most desirable for boys and 
girls of the elementary school to play. Only a few 
are required to play the game and for that reason two 
or more teams are easily formed. It is not too difficult 
to play and may be played out of doors successfully.
-P-A-G-E-259
  EXTRA CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES 249 
Baseball will be next in popularity, and the boys will 
turn to it naturally as a group game in the spring. 
Mass athletics—It is desirable that in the elemen- 
tary school all forms of athletic combats should be 
inter-class and never scholastic in character. It is 
unwise to permit boys or girls of the elementary school 
to compete with teams from other towns, and thus 
enter upon a system of school contests which may 
have connected with them undesirable elements. 
There will be sufficient of that in the senior high school. 
The aim of athletics should be the active participation 
of many rather than the development of skill on the 
part of a few. Inter-class competition will secure 
this and remove any objection which savors of com- 
mercialism. 
Glee clubs and choruses—In the junior high school 
there may be formed separate glee clubs or choruses 
or orchestras. The extent of such organization will 
depend upon the material available and the assistance 
which can be secured to develop it. Certainly when- 
ever or wherever an organization of this type can be 
formed it should be encouraged by the teacher. It 
need not be confined to the larger graded or city 
school; such clubs can very often be organized profit- 
ably in many rural schools. The enthusiasm of both 
teacher and pupils is needed for their successful 
formation. 
Other extra-curricular activities—In addition to 
the hobby clubs and activities involving pupils, there
-P-A-G-E-260
  250 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
are other activities which can be undertaken by the 
school involving the community itself. These will 
range from simple school entertainments to elaborate 
affairs including plays, recitals, and exhibitions. 
Community days—One fine way for the teacher of 
the rural school to get acquainted with her patrons 
is to have a community day at the school. It may 
consist of an entertainment followed by a picnic on 
the school grounds. Such a day will give the teacher 
a wonderful opportunity to get acquainted with the 
parents of her pupils and at the same time will afford 
the opportunity to the patrons to know the teacher 
and her work. In a similar way the teacher of the 
graded school can meet the parents of her pupils by 
inviting them to some activity of the room. While 
many schools do have closing day or Christmas pro- 
grams, it is suggested that the teacher invite the 
parents to school nearer the beginning of the school 
year in order to utilize to the fullest the spirit of good 
will and codperation engendered at such meetings. 
Parent-teacher associations—In many instances the 
outcome of activities involving the parents will be the 
formation of some sort of parent-teacher organizations. 
It may be a Mothers’ Club, a Home and School Club, 
or it may take the name and affiliate with the National 
Parent-Teachers’ Association. These organizations are 
of the utmost value to the teacher and the school. 
Through them many needed reforms can be accom- 
plished. Proper school lunches, beautifying the class- 
M
-P-A-G-E-261
  
EXTRA CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES 251 
rooms or the school grounds, providing playground 
equipment, are some of the objectives that may well 
be entrusted to such an organization. The teacher 
should never assume an important office in such a 
club; the direction should always be left to the parents. 
Nevertheless the teacher should control the situation 
through suggestion and tact. This is necessary in 
order that the organization does not assume unto itself 
the direction of school affairs which properly belongs 
to the board of education or the teacher herself. It 
should never concern itself with problems involving 
methods of teaching, for example, for this is the con- 
cern of the teacher. Some parents’ organizations have 
done this with resulting disruption instead of helpful- 
ness. There are so many things an organization can 
do to assist the teacher in other ways that there is no 
necessity for its interference with the technical work 
of the teacher. But the teacher, if she be tactful and 
wise, can direct activities in worth-while channels and 
thus avoid any semblance of interference. 
It is comparatively easy to secure the codperation 
and interest of the mothers in school activities, but it 
is much more difficult to engage the attention of the 
fathers. This is largely because the fathers are work- 
ing and are unable to attend afternoon meetings. One 
method to overcome this handicap which has been 
successful in many schools is as follows: Arrange a 
regular session of school to be held at night, say from 
8 to 10. Invite fathers and mothers to attend and use
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
a regular school program of classes. Indeed, it might 
be wise not to have school in the afternoon and utilize 
the regular afternoon program schedule at night. In 
this way both parents have abundant opportunity of 
seeing pupils and teacher at work. 
Exhibitions—A popular form of school activity is 
to have an exhibit of pupils’ work. The difficulty with 
most exhibits of this type lies in the fact that the work 
is not representative of the class work of the child, but 
is mainly prepared especially for exhibition purpose. 
Teachers and pupils slave over preparing maps, hand- 
writing drills, compositions, and the like in an en- 
deavor to present only that which is perfect. An 
exhibition of regular school work would be more worth 
while. 
Parents’ exhibitions—An effective form of exhibition 
may be secured by reversing the usual process and 
having an exhibit of articles or work made by parents. 
In one school having a large foreign population the 
mothers were induced to exhibit samples of handwork, 
and the eagerness with which they did so and the pride 
they took in arranging their exhibit brought out the 
fact that the foreigner has much to contribute to our 
civilization as well as absorbing factors of ours. 
School fairs—In rural communities a school fair 
may be profitable. Both pupils and parents may ex- 
hibit results of farm crops and this might be followed 
by a talk by some expert in scientific farming. The 
school fair has many possibilities, and in most cases
-P-A-G-E-263
EXTRA CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES 253 
needs merely the guidance of the teacher to make it 
successful and profitable. It is a patent fact that such 
an activity will bring out the community to the school, 
and this gives the teacher the opportunity of bringing 
the aims and purposes of the school directly to the 
attention of the people, as well as the opportunity of 
securing united community effort for education. 
Whatever the teacher may do in extra-curricular 
activities, whether she confines her efforts to work 
with the pupils or enlarges the scope of work to include 
the entire community, she will find it worth while. 
Too much is the idea prevalent that the school is 
sufficient unto itself. There must be the broader ideal 
of service to the community and relationship between 
everyday life and education emphasized. It involves 
the ability of the teacher to guide, lead, and organize, 
but nowhere else will effort pay such big returns. The 
school is the one non-partisan place where all may 
meet on a common basis on common grounds. The 
school as a busy center touching all phases of com- 
munity life should be the ideal of every teacher 
whether she be located in the most remote, isolated 
rural school or in a graded school situated in our large 
cities.

  CHAPTER XII 
THE OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 
The object of all the educative factors of our school 
system is to develop controls of behavior. These con- 
trols consists of habits, attitudes and skills. The 
process of education consists of the development of 
controls; the end of education is developed controls. 
The teacher, therefore, is concerned with the develop- 
ment of habits, attitudes and skills, and any check 
which she or anyone else may make as to her efficiency 
as a teacher will depend upon the extent to which 
certain habits, attitudes and skills have become fixed. 
Objectives of education—Just what habits, atti- 
tudes and skills are to be included in the curriculum 
is a matter of much concern. Such determination can 
come only as the result of an analysis of all life activi- 
ties in order to discover the elements in such activities 
which contribute most to efficient social life. A num- 
ber of such attempts have been made at various times. 
Of these two are presented as typical. The first is the 
report of the committee which was appointed by the 
National Educational Association to study this prob- 
Jem, and the other is the conclusion of Bobbitt.

A consideration of these objectives will bring to the 
attention of the teacher the desirable habits, attitudes 
and skills which are essential in the life of the child 
and which should on that account form the basis for 
school instruction. She will recognize that in the pro- 
gram suggested for the primary school, the seeds of 
such habits are sown and that if this program as well 
as that suggested for the intermediate and junior high
-P-A-G-E-268
  258 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
school periods be followed, the seeds will grow and 
develop into controls of behavior. 
Habits—Habits are fixed responses which come in 
the face of situations acting as stimuli. The process 
of habit formation consists in making the bond or 
connection between situation and response so firm that 
whenever the situation is presented the desired re- 
sponse is sure to be brought up. Life is made up of 
countless numbers of activities which are purely 
automatic in nature. A simple example of this may be 
found in the use of the multiplication table. By drill 
the bond between situation and response is so firmly 
fixed that the stimulus of any situation involving the 
table brings to mind the correct answer. 
The school subjects taught in our schools may all be 
reduced to a comparative few fundamental elements. 
This common core or mass of knowledge should be 
part of the equipment of every pupil who goes through 
our school system. Unfortunately educators are not 
agreed as to the content of these minimum essentials, 
although we have some well-defined attempts to re- 
duce subject matter to this basis in several fields. 
Undoubtedly there will be more and more agreement 
as time goes on and it may well be assumed that there 
will be more definite results as the study of this need 
continues. The value of such determination will lie 
in the release of energy. The teacher will be able to 
fix as habits the essential elements and thus permit 
the pupil to think about, organize, and make a part
-P-A-G-E-269
  THE OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 259 
of his fund of general information the other elements 
of school subjects. 
Minimum essentials of various school subjects—As 
indicated above, the minimum essentials of some sub- 
jects are fairly well fixed. In reading we may say 
that sound recognition or the mechanics of reading 
and comprehension of the common words in the 
average vocabulary of the child should belong to 
this field of habit formation. In arithmetic, counting, 
the four fundamental operations, including, of course, 
the combinations and multiplication table through the 
nines, the various tables, operations with simple frac- 
tions, and the rules of percentage on the one hand, and 
the general method of analysis and solution of prob- 
lems on the other should be included. In language, 
oral and written, spelling of the common words (as 
found in the Ayres spelling scale, for example), funda- 
mental laws of correct speech and the use of the dic- 
tionary may well belong. In the fields of history, 
geography, hygiene, and civics it is not agreed so gen- 
erally as to just what are the minimum elements 
children should learn as automatic responses. 
The function of the teacher in habit fixation—The 
job of the teacher in this process is largely one of 
supplying the stimulus which will urge children to 
assimilate these knowledge facts and make them auto- 
matic. There should always be the emphasis upon 
the efficiency gained through the habit formation. In 
this the example of the teacher plays a large part as
-P-A-G-E-270
  260 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
well as the attitude assumed toward the desirability 
of making these minimum essentials a part of the 
pupil’s equipment. The drill method, involving atten- 
tive repetition, will be found of the greatest value in 
accomplishing this. 
Attitudes—Scarcely less important than the habits 
the child forms are the attitudes he assumes toward 
knowledge. It is essential that many of our lessons 
in school involve the problem of the establishment of 
attitudes. The lessons in appreciation will partially 
do this. Of course, it is desirable that school children 
adopt proper attitudes toward music, literature, and 
art, but the development of attitudes involves much 
more than this. Ideals and standards are easily set 
up and absorbed by children in school situations; it 
should also be the concern of the teacher to see that 
this is done on the playground and street as well. In 
many instances the schools have felt no responsibility 
outside of the school activities. The broadening influ- 
ence of the school in extra-curricular activities is 
making itself felt. There is great need for even more 
and more directed and conscious effort in this line. 
This means that the awakening influence of the new 
education will make itself more and more a definite 
part of our school work. 
Advancing civilization is responsible for many school 
curriculum changes, and, by the same token, changes 
in the child’s perspective toward life. The automobile, 
the apartment house, rapid and easy means of com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  
THE OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 261 
munication, all play their part in these curricular 
changes. 
The effect of the automobile on the curriculum— 
The automobile is essentially an invention of the 
twentieth century. Like similar inventions of this 
period it has played a tremendous part in changing 
the status of the varying members of the social order, 
and has left a profound impress upon the school cur- 
riculum. During the period 1900-1911 the automobile 
was more or less of a curiosity, and one who set out on 
a journey in one did so without knowing whether the 
journey would be completed or whether it would be 
a series of mishaps similar to those attending the 
efforts of the aéroplane at the present time, and end 
miles away from the desired objective. By 1915 the 
automobile had come into common use, and from that 
time on its increased use, both commercially and for 
pleasure, has been extremely rapid. 
Due to this rapid growth and particularly due to 
the fact that it passed from the luxury class in which 
it was a plaything of the rich to the common everyday 
use by the general public, there has been a great break- 
ing up of the isolation of the groups formerly found 
in our cities, towns, and rural communities. It is true 
that the development of the railroads and trolleys 
had already done much to bring people of widely 
separated communities into more intimate contact; 
it remained for the automobile to make further pos- 
sible the interchange of products, both mental and 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  262 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
material. A railway journey of one hundred miles was 
a project involving much; at the present time the 
motorist goes two and three hundred miles a day in 
comfort and in ease. There is even a further develop- 
ment in this in the auto tramp who visits widely the 
various parts of our country independent of hotels and 
restaurants, carrying his equipment with him and thus 
opening up possibilities of travel unknown and un- 
thought of ten years ago. 
What effect has all of this had upon our schools and 
especially upon the attitudes of the pupils in our 
schools? For one thing our pupils have had an oppor- 
tunity to see many forms of nature and to visit many 
different sections of the country. The effect upon 
teaching nature study, geography, history, and similar 
subjects has been tremendous. The pupil has been 
brought in contact with other forms of life than those 
in his immediate environment. He has seen with his 
own eyes flowers, trees, birds, and is not dependent 
upon textbook descriptions and pictures for his knowl- 
edge of such factors. His vocabulary has been en- 
riched. Most pupils will talk glibly of gas, chauffeur, 
pistons, fenders, and the like, and in so doing will dis- 
play a knowledge and will use a language entirely 
foreign to the comprehension of the boy or girl of 1900. 
His interest in mechanics, nature, machinery in gen- 
eral, and travel per se has been aroused, stimulated, 
and to some extent at least, satisfied. 
In general there has been a breaking up of the isola-
-P-A-G-E-273
THE OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 263 
tion of the city and rural groups. Good roads, a by- 
product of the movement, have linked up country and 
city and a trip of twenty miles or more after a strenu- 
ous day in the field has been made possible. As a 
result the schools have been forced to recognize that 
children have had a different experience, a different 
environment and a different mode of living which has 
compelled the abandonment of much of the older 
curriculum and the substitution of materials in keep- 
ing with the enriched experience of its people. 
The apartment and the curriculum—Modern life 
with its increasing complexity is responsible for many 
changes in the living conditions of the individual. 
It has demanded rapid transportation, and we have 
the express train and the automobile. It has de- 
manded new foods, and the world is searched for viands 
and they are brought to our table. Twenty-five years 
ago we were a fairly rural nation; today we are crowd- 
ing into the cities. All of this has contributed to the 
apartment house—itself a product of life in the 
twentieth century, developed to meet the demands for 
living quarters in the midst of city activities. 
Into these cliff dwellings the modern family has 
moved and as a result of such procedure we find a host 
of elements expressing themselves and exerting their 
influence on the school. Of the many elements thus 
involved, the teacher is concerned principally with the 
ones involving the formation of habits, attitudes and 
skills as found in relationships with others. 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  264 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
Apartment house living imposes upon the child 
many restrictions and presents many situations which 
would be totally absent in such degree under any 
other form of living conditions. The semi-private 
living of families in apartments calls for consideration 
of the rights of others, codperation, a strict minding of 
one’s own business, honesty and similar attitudes. Be- 
cause of the needs of the apartment house life, the 
child needs to form these controls. Thus we find the 
school stressing through all sorts and types of actual 
life projects in English, history and reading classes 
such elements as courtesy, regard for others and the 
like type of attitudes. 
Again, apartment house living tends to inhibit 
many of the attitudes which were common to other 
forms of living such as are found in more suburban 
and rural communities. The hospitality, the friendli- 
ness of the old homes is gone. The child, for the most 
part, is a friendly being, but respect for the rights, 
privileges and privacy of others causes the inhibition 
of the type of friendliness commonly found in homes 
other than the apartment. This in turn is reflected 
in the school, especially in the type of project used 
to develop attitudes. Emphasis on “waiting until one 
is asked” is quite commonly a characteristic of many 
of them. 
To sum up, we can say that apartment house living, 
by bringing families into closer physical relationship, 
has set free a host of attitudes which are developed
-P-A-G-E-275
THE OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 265 
through controls taught the child through various 
school activities. The school organization, the class- 
room activities and hence the curriculum itself is cog- 
nizant of this and to some extent, at least, is influenced 
by this change in the living of a large proportion of 
our population. 
Attitudes resulting from the foreign population— 
America is a cosmopolitan nation. Nowhere on the 
face of the globe will be found a nation composed of 
so many different races as in America. America has 
been called the melting pot of the nations, but that 
means a total submergence of the culture of the races 
represented in America. Immigration should be con- 
sidered rather as a give-and-take process in which 
America has as much to learn from foreign culture as 
the foreigner has to learn from us. 
In our schools there has been a constant influx of 
foreign children. This is not confined to our cities 
alone; there are very few schools in our country which 
are not touched by the presence of the “stranger in 
our midst.” There are, of course, many schools com- 
posed entirely of foreign children. For a long time 
we tried to ignore this presence, but at the present 
time we find evidences in our schools that such pres- 
ence is responsible for many changes. 
The foreigner represented in our schools has a 
different attitude toward personal and social sanita- 
tion than we. We shudder at the crowded living 
quarters, the dirt, the filth of foreign sections, without 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  266 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
stopping to realize that sanitary conditions in the 
home countries of these peoples are different from 
ours and that which we see is not indifference, but 
merely a reflection of what these people know with 
respect to such matters. The new point of view must 
be carried to the immigrant by the public school 
through the agency of the child. To this end the 
teacher finds her problem one largely concerned with 
the establishment of attitudes. Our schools include 
instruction in the necessity of sleeping with windows 
open, frequent baths, care of hair, teeth and personal 
cleanliness, together with proper attitudes with respect 
to care and cleanliness of home surroundings. 
The foreign pupil has a different background from 
the American child. He is in touch with the culture 
of other countries. Geography teaching, history teach- 
ing and the like become more real and vital, while on 
the other hand attitudes toward the land of his adop- 
tion must be developed. Our schools then become 
more vitalized with respect to the culture of other 
countries, while emphasis must be placed upon the 
significance of American institutions. An example will 
make this plain. In most foreign countries the police- 
man, or officer corresponding to him, as an officer and 
representative of the government was a person to be 
feared, avoided and referred to as a superior. The 
school has a real task in changing that attitude to one 
in which the child looks upon the policeman as a 
friend, a protector, a person to whom one may appeal
-P-A-G-E-277
  THE OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 267 
in time of trouble and one who stands for justice and 
fair play. 
The organization of the school, the teaching method, 
in short, the entire activity of the classroom must take 
into account the peculiar problem resulting from the 
foreign child. Folk songs, folk dances, handwork and 
even cooking is to be modified by the presence of the 
foreigner. Instead of condemning all that is foreign, 
the teacher is to take the best of foreign culture and 
add it to those attitudes which are distinctively 
American and from the composite whole mold and 
shape lives into efficient citizenship. Patriotism, 
loyalty and devotion to the home country is thus natu- 
rally and easily transferred to the land of his adoption 
because his study of history, geography, English and 
civics has used the background of his origin as well 
as his new environment in the endeavor to help him 
form those attitudes which will enable him to appre- 
ciate America and American institutions in the right 
way. 
The proper perspective—Through the examples 
given above it has been shown that the teacher is 
confronted by many elements which demand the de- 
velopment of a proper perspective with respect to the 
complex age in which the child lives. In the final 
analysis the attitudes assumed by the child as a result 
of his school education are essentially a response to 
fundamental ideals. These fundamental ideals and 
standards must be raised in the classroom, on the
-P-A-G-E-278
    268 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
playground, the street, in short, in the environment 
of the child; his school education must give to him the 
proper attitude (perspective) which he will instantly 
and instinctively assume because of his training and 
education. 
Skills—The term skill is used so commonly that it 
scarcely needs to be defined. In brief, that which we 
consider as skill is merely a combination of habits 
previously learned which are now arranged in a new 
combination. A child may learn or may have pre- 
viously learned the muscular movements in drawing. 
When these movements in combination are mastered 
so that pictorial representation is the result, it is said 
that he has some skill in drawing. School activities 
are largely concerned with the mastery of elements for 
the purpose of developing skills. The skills developed 
and the extent to which it is desirable they be mas- 
tered will depend chiefly upon the aim of the school. 
The trade school is concerned with the development 
of one type of skill, the commercial school with an 
entirely different type, while the “cultural school” is 
concerned with still other skills. Thus it is essential 
that the teacher know and keep in mind the skills 
which the particular kind of education offered in school 
is supposed to develop. He will then devote his 
energies toward the establishment of these skills in his 
pupils. 
Relation of habits to skills—It is obvious that any 
development of skills is dependent upon habits. When
-P-A-G-E-279
THE OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 269 
previously learned habits can be easily combined in 
new ways a skill is easily learned. If the habit must 
first be learned, or if the new combination of habits is 
difficult for the individual to form, then the skill is 
learned slowly. In this as in other endeavors, indi- 
vidual differences will be easily apparent. 
The desirable elements of habit are accuracy and 
speed. This is apparent in reading, arithmetic, and 
handwriting, as well as in other school arts. A pupil 
may form the reading habit, but if he be slow or in- 
accurate, his habit is of little value to him. The 
practical, everyday world in which the pupil will find 
himself demands habits of accuracy and speed. Skills 
which are made up from habits must therefore contain 
these same elements in greater or less degree. The 
important part of school work lies in the making of 
skilful products—pupils who can use the knowledge 
gained in school in a skilful way. 
Analysis of a typical skill—Handwriting may be 
selected as a typical skill, the development of which 
occupies the teacher for a considerable time in the 
elementary school. Handwriting is a sensori-motor 
activity, that is, stimulation of certain sense organs 
produces a muscular reaction. Skilful handwriting 
will be found to be made up of a series of specific habits 
combined in a certain way to form legible handwriting. 
Among these habits may be found: proper position, 
proper placing of the paper, correct position in which 
to hold the pencil or pen, proper coérdination of muscle 
   
-P-A-G-E-280
  270 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
movement. All of these habits have been made the 
subjects of specific, separate drills until they can be 
executed perfectly. Then all of these specific habits 
are placed together in combination to produce the 
skill. Obviously, if the skill is faulty the fault must 
be traced back to the incorrect habit and that cor- 
rected. As no chain is stronger than its weakest link, 
so no skill is more skilful than its weakest habit. 
The measurement of habits, attitudes and skills— 
The average classroom teacher is not only concerned 
with the teaching of habits, attitudes and skills, but 
she is also anxious to know whether the teaching 
methods she is using are producing results. It has been 
shown how achievement in school subject matter may 
easily be measured. It remains to be seen how habits, 
attitudes and skills may be measured. ‘It is true that 
but little has been done in this field, but the way has 
been shown, the pioneer work done. All that is needed 
is more extensive experimentation. 
Habits, attitudes and skills can be developed. 
Therefore they can be measured in term of behavior. 
If the bond or connection is strong enough, when- 
ever a certain stimulus is presented, we can judge the 
habits by the type of response which is made. The 
same is true of attitudes and skills as the same funda- 
mental element is present in both. Attempts to 
measure habits, attitudes and skills by noting the be- 
havior of individuals who, under standard conditions, 
responded to standard stimuli has been made in the
-P-A-G-E-281
THE OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 271 
Chassell Citizenship Scale, the Trabue Scale for meas- 
uring the appreciation of poetry, and the Payne Scale 
for measuring habits and practices in health and 
accident prevention. In each of these, behavior—the 
result of exposure to a stimulus—has been measured. 
Unquestionably the next decade will see a great appli- 
cation of the measurement theory applied to this most 
important of subjects. 
Professional outcomes of teaching—In addition to 
the above outcomes of teaching, which, after all, con- 
cern the pupil himself, there are professional outcomes 
resulting to the teacher herself. These are habits of 
work, professional attitudes and teaching skills which 
will be developed as the teacher gains in experience 
and professional growth. Teaching as a profession is 
one of the noblest of callings. In the past it has been 
often degraded by the unprofessional teacher who has 
failed to grasp the significance of the ideal of service, 
but the future is bright for the thoroughly professional 
teacher who is eager to work and has the vision of 
service for others. As a profession, schoolteaching is 
a young profession but there will be found nowhere 
any more devoted followers than the teachers of the 
nation. The value of the schoolteacher to the school, 
the community, and the state cannot be measured in 
dollars and cents. Doubling or tripling teachers’ 
salaries will never provide an adequate return for the 
services rendered. The reward of a teacher lies not 
in a salary schedule, nor in honors or promotions, but  
-P-A-G-E-282
  272 FIRST BOOK IN EDUCATION 
in the self-consciousness that she has helped some one 
along the path of knowledge.

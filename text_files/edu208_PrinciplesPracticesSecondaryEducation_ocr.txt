  AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
In this text, the teaching process, the learning 
process, the objectives and the subject matter of re- 
organized secondary education are presented in an 
epitomized form. The discussions may be thought of 
under seven grand-divisions together with their cor- 
responding sub-divisions. These divisions have not 
been explicitly or mechanically outlined as such, but 
they are obvious. The seven major unit topics of 
secondary education reflected in these discussions are: 
(1) The training of high school instructors, including 
the technique of teaching; (2) the learning process of 
the high school pupil, together with provision for 
individual differences; (3) the general historical de- 
velopment of Huropean and American secondary 
education during the nineteenth century; (4) the re- 
organization of secondary education in terms of the 
junior high school, senior high school and junior 
college; (5) the broadening purposes of reorganized 
secondary education and their application to cur- 
riculum building; (6) the organization and administra- 
tion of the program of studies as a whole, and of the 
separate high school subjects; (7) and the organiza- 
tion and administration of the non-academic aspects or 
the correlated activities of the high school. This is to 
say, in brief, that the secondary school teacher and the 
teaching process, the secondary school pupil and

the learning process, the plurality of broadening 
aims, organization of the subject matter in conformity 
to these aims and the organization and direction of 
school activities represent the major generic consid- 
erations of this treatise. 
In the use of this text in classroom work, it is pos- 
sible to begin with chapters [X, X and XI, which treat 
the historical aspect of secondary education, in case 
this seems to be more desirable. It is also possible to 
begin with chapter XVI, which discusses the aims of 
secondary education, to be followed by chapters XIV 
and XV, which deal with the junior-senior high school 
and junior college. It is possible to shift the order 
of the chapters as they occur in the text so as to adapt 
them to the dominant needs of the courses offered in 
different institutions. References given at the end of 
the chapters are representative, not exhaustive. In 
some instances they should be supplemented by ref- 
erences given at the ends of chapters in the author’s 
text, entitled ‘‘Curriculum Making in Secondary 
Schools.’’ Not all of the points involved in the ref- 
erences given at the ends of the chapters are embodied 
in the discussion of the text, so that it is recommended 
that the references be used as the basis of the readings 
for papers on additional unit topics to be worked out 
by the various student members of the classes. 
The text stands for at least three underlying theses. 
It is assumed, first, that a knowledge of fundamental 
theory of secondary education, embodied in a series 
of principles, is essential for guidance in secondary 
school practice. In the second place, it is assumed 
that secondary school subject matter, as embodied in
-P-A-G-E-7
  
AUTHOR’S PREFACE vii 
the separate school subjects, should be reformulated 
in terms of the broadening objectives of education. 
The author’s viewpoint in this connection represents 
predominantly that reflected in the recent report of the 
Committee of the Unit Curricula of the North Central 
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, of 
which he was a member for three years. Naturally, 
the suggestions relative to the nature of subject matter, 
as discussed in this text under the separate groups of 
subjects, are colored by the method of procedure and 
the point of view recommended by the above committee 
as a whole. In the third place, it is assumed that 
school subjects should represent all of the fundamental 
modes of human experience, including both the ideals 
and the activities of society and of individuals, and in- 
cluding furthermore both the present and probable 
future experiences regarded as most desirable and 
profitable.

    EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
As the number of students in our colleges and uni- 
versities who are definitely preparing for work in 
secondary education increases, the need for systematic 
presentation of the principles underlying this division 
of our public educational system becomes more evi- 
dent. The prescription on the part of such organi- 
zations as the North Central Association of Colleges 
and Preparatory Schools of a definite minimum 
amount of professional training for all planning to 
teach in their accredited high schools, while not specif- 
ically requiring courses having to do with the prin- 
ciples of secondary education, undoubtedly implies 
that due emphasis be placed upon them. In fact, if 
the courses in the field of education presented by the 
teacher applying for a position in such a school 
omitted such work, the administrative officer review- 
ing the papers presented would be justified in conclud- 
ing that the professional training of the candidate 
was inadequate. 
There is, therefore, little doubt that the tendency 
already evident in some of our colleges of Education 
and teachers’ colleges, to require of all candidates for 
graduation successful completion of a course covering 
the principles of secondary education, will become more 
widespread and probably will eventually be as 
generally prescribed as is already the subject of 
ix

  x EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Educational Psychology. While care must be taken 
by those responsible for the content of the courses in 
education to guard against the danger of illegitimate 
overlapping in the fundamental courses dealing with 
technique of method, educational application of psy- 
chology and the general principles of secondary 
education, no curriculum for the training of high 
school teachers is adequate which does not include 
serious consideration of the three fundamental educa- 
tion courses. 
The volume herewith submitted to the educational 
public is a serious attempt to present to such students 
and to others interested the great problems of second- 
ary education, giving due emphasis to their historical 
setting and considering them from the standpoint of 
the most serious efforts looking towards the reorgani-. 
zation of our system in harmony with the recognized 
educational objectives. Professor Clement’s active 
participation in much of this attempted reorganiza- 
tion fits him peculiarly well for the task of discussing 
the whole problem of secondary education in its most 
fundamental aspects.

  Principles and Practices of Secondary 
Education 
CHAPTER I 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS 
AND PURPOSES 
Interrelation of Principles and Problems.—Numer- 
ous secondary school problems have arisen recently 
which call for rational solution. Satisfactory solu- 
tions of these problems are dependent upon the correct 
applications of fundamental principles. Educational 
principles and problems are always closely inter- 
related. Secondary school problems, in both their 
generic and specific forms, have appeared in unusually 
large numbers during the last ten or fifteen years. 
Accompanying these problems are the changing con- 
ceptions of modern secondary educational theory. 
One means of calling attention to the need of a knowl- 
edge of guiding principles is to list an array of present- 
day problems which need to be met and solved. For 
the most part, the present treatise will discuss con- 
jointly, therefore, the principles and problems of 
secondary education, rather than separate them. 
Aspects Constituting Secondary School Problems.— 
In order to become cognizant of the secondary school 
3
-P-A-G-E-26
  4 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
as an institutional unit and agency, it is necessary to 
make a study of the teaching corps, including their 
professional training; of the nature of the pupils 
psychologically and sociologically considered; of the 
historical growth of the secondary school; of its aims; 
of the methods of instruction; of the materials offered; 
and of all the so-called extra-curricular activities of 
the institution in its recent form. 
Generic Statement of Problems or Topics.—Generi- 
cally considered, such problems as the following 
suggest themselves: Fundamentals in secondary edu- 
cation; the study of Education as a profession; 
secondary education with reference to the pupil; the 
historical development of American secondary educa- 
tion as a permanent and democratic institution; 
fundamental concepts in high school reorganization; 
secondary school objectives in relation to curriculum 
building; new materials within the different groups of 
high school subjects; organized activities in relation to 
health; and other aspects of the high school. 
Detailed Array of Specific Problems or Topics.— 
Numerous topics, somewhat more specific, suggest 
themselves in terms of the above generic types, and 
may be regarded as appropriate for consideration in 
the field of reorganized secondary education. Most 
of these will be discussed, to some extent at least, later 
on in this text. The order of the topics as named be- 
low need not be regarded as at alliron-clad. They can 
easily be rearranged, at will, for purposes of discus- 
sion without destroying their significance. It will be 
noted that the historical development of secondary 
education is not discussed until after the presentation
-P-A-G-E-27
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 5 
of a number of the somewhat more practical issues. 
The chief reason for this order is to motivate an in- 
terest in the professional study of Education, as such, 
on the part of the student. 
The following list of topics is somewhat more 
specific than the so-called generic types suggested 
above, though in some instances it may appear that 
some of them are so inclusive as to be generic rather 
than specific. Representative topics which are illus- 
trative of current secondary school principles, prob- 
lems, and practices are such as these: Changing 
conceptions of modern secondary education in terms 
of objectives, subject matter, method and organiza- 
tion; the comparison of the professional study of 
Education with the popular view of education; the 
nature and practices of the modern technique of high 
school instruction; the complexity of the learning 
process of high school pupils; measuring the results of 
high school teaching; the adaptation of subject matter 
to individual differences through group and individual 
instruction; the nature and distribution of high school 
population; the general development of secondary 
education in Europe; the historical development of the 
grammar school and the academy, in America; the 
development of the American public high school during 
the nineteenth century; the development of high school 
education in Chicago, as representative of the Middle 
West; the principle of unity in relation to the educa- . 
tive process; the junior-senior high school idea; the 
junior college idea; the high school as a codrdinating 
center of the community; the multiplicity of second- 
ary school objectives; that knowledge which is of

most worth; the business of curriculum making in 
secondary schools; new materials of instruction in lan- 
guages (English and foreign); new materials of in- 
struction in history and the other social studies; 
new materials of instruction in mathematics and in 
natural science; new materials of instruction in prac- 
tical arts; new materials of instruction in fine arts; 
an organized program of health activity; other di- 
rected activities of high school; the function and value 
of pupil guidance in high schools. 
General Purpose of This Treatise—The general pur- 
pose of this treatise is to present a cross-sectional 
view of the fundamental principles and practices of 
reorganized secondary education as a whole in 
America. It is assumed in this volume that the reader 
is desirous of knowing about the nature of the public 
secondary schools of America, just as one might pre- 
sumably be interested in knowing about the nature 
of industrial plants or other commercial, social or 
political institutions, together with the underlying 
principles of operation and management, and the na- 
ture of their results and products. Because of the 
extensive scope of the materials covered in this text, 
it will be necessary, for the most part, to confine the 
discussions to somewhat introductory statements of 
principles and problems. 
Specific Purposes of the Treatise—In addition to 
the above general purpose, several specific purposes 
have been consciously kept in mind. The major 
specific purpose is to present an array of principles 
and facts which will serve as a basis for an intro- 
ductory study of Education to undergraduate students
-P-A-G-E-29
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 7 
  in the departments and colleges of Education in the 
higher institutions of learning. An acquaintanceship 
with terminology alone in the professional study of 
Education is essential in order for the novice in this 
field to make any progress. Added to this, there is 
the need of an intelligent understanding of principles, 
tendencies and movements, old and new, in the field of 
secondary education. This discussion, then, in the first 
place is intended to serve as preparatory to the study 
of the more highly differentiated and specialized 
phases of secondary education pursued during the 
senior years and graduate work of students in higher 
institutions of learning. Another purpose, partly 
general and partly specific, is to present to other 
individuals not specializing in this field a body of 
guiding principles and reliable facts which will enable 
them to appreciate the newer movements and tend- 
encies in secondary education, as well as to remind 
them of those phases which have tended to persist and 
carry over from the past. In other words, the pur- 
pose is to present as untechnically as possible, a body 
of psychological and sociological principles and facts 
to all groups of individuals who may be interested in 
the field of the systematic and scientific study of Edu- 
cation. 
Increasing Specialization in Secondary Education.— 
Certain aspects of the discussions, herein given, per- 
taining to secondary education are applicable as well 
to the elementary school. This is especially true with 
reference to the upper years of the elementary school. 
Certain phases also of these discussions apply to 
higher education, especially to the first two years of
-P-A-G-E-30
  8 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
college work. However, secondary education is now 
becoming so highly differentiated that it is necessary 
to outline a body of principles primarily applicable 
to the six years now included in reorganized secondary 
education. This last phase represents the main 
province of the statements made in this text. 
Groups of Persons for Whom This. Text Was 
Written.—In the event these discussions do fulfill the 
above purposes, they may be used with some degree of 
profit by junior and senior high school instructors and 
administrators; by students and instructors in 
teachers’ colleges, and in other higher institutions of 
learning; by parent-teacher associations, and by 
such other organizations as in any way sponsor educa- 
tional practices, or discuss educational problems.

CHAPTER II 
THE IMPORTANCE OF A KNOWLEDGE OF 
FUNDAMENTALS IN SECONDARY 
EDUCATION 
Introductory Statement.—In the preliminary state- 
ment of Chapter I, an array of topics and problems 
was listed illustrating the growing complexity of the 
field of secondary education. It was also suggested 
that it is the purpose of this text to present this array 
of problems to both students of Education as such, 
and to lay-members in Education, for further study 
and appreciation. The purpose of the present chap- 
ter is to emphasize the necessity of a knowledge of 
fundamental principles for individuals engaged in the 
secondary schools. 
  General Meaning, Importance, Purposes and 
Scope of the Fundamentals of Secondary 
Education 
General Nature and Importance of Fundamentals.— 
Secondary education has developed rapidly and in very 
large proportions during recent years. It is quite 
justifiable and necessary, therefore, to discuss the na- 
ture and importance of principles in a much more 
detailed way than has been widely customary, in view 
of the development of this increasingly more spe- 
9
-P-A-G-E-32
  10 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
cialized phase of secondary school work. In order 
that this secondary field may continue to be developed 
under guidance, it is necessary to recognize certain 
underlying principles. Otherwise, considerable chaos 
is sure to result from the tendency to reorganize sec- 
ondary education so rapidly, and on such a large scale 
as has recently occurred. 
The phrase ‘‘fundamentals of secondary education,’’ 
for purposes of the present discussion, may be re- 
garded as synonymous with the commonly used 
‘principles of secondary education.’’ It is always 
necessary to assume certain ‘‘foundations’’ whenever 
reorganization is attempted in any field, in order to 
avoid undue waste. Obviously, the determination and 
assumption of fundamental principles is important as 
the basis of any genuine attempt to reorganize high 
school education. 
The tendency to speak of ‘‘groundwork’’ or 
‘foundations’? has appeared from time to time in 
published materials in the various fields of psychology 
and of sociology, as well as in the field of Education. 
It will, perhaps, be generally conceded that because of 
the experimental and laboratory work in the past, more 
scientific progress has been made in the field of psychol- 
ogy than in the fields of either sociology or Educa- 
tion. 
Difficulty in Establishing Fundamentals.—The natu- 
ral scientist is often inclined to feel that the principles 
evolved in his own field are much more trustworthy 
than are those in the three fields mentioned above. 
And on the whole this is true, partly for the reason 
that experimentation in the natural sciences has been
-P-A-G-E-33
  
  IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING FUNDAMENTALS = 11 
going on for so many years, and partly for the reason 
that human materials are less wieldy, and less subject 
to accurately controlled experimentation at all times 
than purely physical materials. In dealing with 
human activity, it will never be possible to determine 
principles with the same accuracy as in the field of the 
physical universe. 
But in spite of this fact, it must be recognized that 
controlling principles are necessary in order to make 
progress in the social and educational world. And it 
is only through painstaking effort that it is possible to 
approximate a scientific determination of principles 
through experimentation, and to approximate sound 
theory through reflective thinking on problems of 
secondary education. 
The Functions and Scope of Principles.—Organized 
principles of secondary education should serve at 
least two purposes. First, they should serve as the 
basis of intelligent and profitable practice. The na- 
ture of principles is constant and universal. The 
application of them will necessarily vary from one 
generation to another, or from one situation to another 
within the same generation, due to changing condi- 
tions. In the second place, the meaning of the educa- 
tive process as a whole can be interpreted best in 
the light of well-established principles. This is to say 
that principles should serve the double purpose of 
guiding and of interpreting secondary school practice. 
In this way it is possible to establish what may be 
thought of as a philosophy of secondary education 
whose chief purpose is to determine values and funda- 
mentals.
-P-A-G-E-34
12 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
  Mere Change, Separate from Reflection, Undesir- 
able-—The attempt to determine fundamentals in any 
phase of human experience whatever is always impor- 
tant. The phrase ‘‘reorganized secondary education’’ 
has been introduced into our vocabulary during the 
last few decades. Educational affairs have been ad- 
vancing in ‘‘high gear.’’ It is essential that we guard 
against being swept off of earlier foundations which 
have been regarded as trustworthy in our educational 
procedure. To keep a wholesome balance or perspec- 
tive between the successful practices of the past and 
profitable future practices is an outstanding obligation 
on the part of all persons engaged in the work of our 
secondary schools. 
The above caution is more important than may ap- 
pear at first thought. Secondary school officers and 
instructors are usually very deeply engrossed in the 
administrative workings of their school systems, and 
often do not find time to reflect upon fundamentals 
and their meanings in terms of practice. On the other 
hand, theorists who are specialists in the field of 
secondary education seldom find it possible to see all 
of the principles regarded as fundamental by them 
tested under actual conditions in the schoolroom. 
It is important, therefore, to interrelate the inter- 
ests of secondary school officers and instructors, in 
terms of practice, with the interests of those who have 
become specialists in the theory of secondary schools. 
The temptation to try the new in secondary education 
without a high degree of reflective consideration is 
about as common as is the temptation to continue the 
old in theory and practice, without a high degree of
-P-A-G-E-35
  IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING FUNDAMENTALS 13 
analysis. Consequential secondary school theory must 
be constituted of fundamentals. The attempt to de- 
termine fundamental tenets requires reflective anal- 
ysis. This holds true in the study of Education as 
well as in other fields, such as science. Superficial 
educational theory and random practice will be re- 
duced greatly whenever the chief concern of individ- 
uals is an eager desire to establish thoroughgoing, 
groundwork principles. 
Expenditure of Time and Energy Necessary.—The 
development and the understanding of far-reaching 
principles of Education require effort and research of 
the most strenuous kind. Long intervals of time, as 
well as many attempts, are necessary in order to ac- 
complish this task. Students of Education, therefore, 
should be introduced as early as possible to these 
important concepts, through the courses offered in our 
higher institutions of learning. Conscious study of 
these principles for at least two years, in one form or 
another, in the various courses offered in departments 
and colleges of Education, is none too long for mastery 
by the amateur teacher, who graduates from one of the 
higher institutions of learning in America and then 
goes immediately into a teaching position. 
The Constancy and Universality of Principles—As 
previously suggested, fundamental principles in any 
field of endeavor are universal in nature. Further- 
more, they are not limited in their application by any 
short span of years. They represent constant factors 
in the educative process. Because of the increasing 
number of problems in modern secondary education, 
it is quite important that there be some agreement on
-P-A-G-E-36
  14 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
what may be thought of as ‘‘foundations’’ or ‘‘fun- 
damentals.’’ The attempt to determine fundamental 
bases in secondary education demands reflective edu- 
cational thinking of the highest order. The scope of 
fundamentals includes the nature of pupils, the train- 
ing of instructors, the nature of the curricula in gen- 
eral, the organization and administration of separate 
high school subjects and the organization and direction 
of school activities outside of the curriculum. 
The Development of an Institutional Consciousness 
in Terms of Secondary Education 
Importance of an Institutional Sense in Case of 
Leaders.—During recent years, it has become more and 
more customary for individuals who intend to become 
leaders to make a detailed study of industrial and 
manufacturing plants, and of commercial institutions 
as a whole. In this way it is possible for a limited 
number of persons to develop a wholesome and intel- 
ligent attitude toward the institution, including every 
activity of every phase represented. The acquisition 
of such an institutional sense, involving a knowledge 
of the total workings of a plant, or of a business enter- 
prise, is essential to the success of any person or group 
of persons, who presume to be leaders and aggressive 
organizers. In so far as it is possible to do so, it is 
also important to develop this same attitude toward 
any institution and its activities on the part of all the 
less conspicuous persons who participate in any way 
in its operation.
-P-A-G-E-37
  IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING FUNDAMENTALS = 15 
An Institutional Sense Valuable in Case of All 
School Officers.—To recapitulate, then, it has become 
common practice, at least for leading workers in large 
industrial and manufacturing plants, to make a study 
of the operations and the output of the whole institu- 
tion. In large stores, and in other business organiza-. 
tions, the tendency is now to develop just so far as is 
possible this same spirit, characterized as an institu- 
tional sense. In all social organizations of importance, 
there is large virtue in having certain persons con- 
nected with such institutions who are cognizant of the 
purposes and workings in their entirety. 
The Secondary School as a Social Institution —The 
secondary school of America is now recognized as one 
of the most consequential social institutions of modern 
times. Speaking analogously of the secondary school 
with reference to a knowledge of the workings of in- 
dustrial and commercial organizations, it may rightly 
be argued that it is important to develop what may be 
characterized as an institutional consciousness involv- 
ing a clear comprehension of all of its purposes, means 
and activities. Perhaps nowhere does the principle 
of ‘‘social solidarity’’ apply with more point than in 
the teaching corps of secondary schools. 
In order to develop a type of institutional sense that 
will eventuate into increasingly better practice, it is 
necessary that all individuals in any way connected 
with secondary schools make an effort to become 
cognizant of fundamentals. It is assumed, of course, 
that administrative officers and leaders in secondary 
schools will do this much, as representing their min- 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
16 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
imum of effort. In a social institution, such as the 
secondary school is presumed to be, it is essential to 
its highest progress that all of the individual instruc- 
tors, as well as the administrative officers, be as fully 
acquainted as possible with the real ‘‘ groundwork’? of 
secondary education as a whole. 
Specialization Necessitates a Knowledge of the 
Whole.—In the modern industrial world, the division 
of labor has gone on with great rapidity and to a high 
degree. Specialization and differentiation in the dif- 
ferent fields of knowledge have likewise been highly 
developed. The necessity of a consciousness of an 
industrial plant or an institution in its entirety, or of 
all of the aspects of a large unit of knowledge, is 
obvious at the present time. In the simple beginnings 
of elementary and secondary education in America, it 
was possible to make a survey, in toto, of practically 
all of the various aspects of the educative process. 
Specialization in elementary, secondary and higher 
education has been carried on, however, to a rather 
high degree already in this country. Clearly the de- 
velopment of an institutional sense in the industrial 
world is important because of the tendency toward the 
division of labor. Analogously, the consciousness of 
the purposes, means and methods of the secondary 
school as a whole is fundamental because of the high 
degree of specialization in the various phases of sec- 
ondary school work which have already appeared. 
An institutional consciousness should, therefore, be 
possessed by all secondary school officers, including all 
of the teaching corps, in order to give a relational
-P-A-G-E-39
  
IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING FUNDAMENTALS 17 
meaning to differentiated and specialized aspects of 
the school system. 
The Interrelation between Physical and Social 
Environment, and the Function of Secondary 
Education 
Nature and Meaning of Environment.—Technically 
considered, the relation of an individual to his environ- 
ment is a very complicated affair. Apparently the 
world about an individual is partly physical or ma- 
terial, and partly psychic or mental. An individual’s 
physical and social environment are reciprocally re- 
lated. An individual’s real environment is composed 
of the sum total of the reactions made by him to mean- 
ingful stimuli. That is to say, only that part of his 
surroundings to which he reacts represents significant 
and educative environment for him. Furthermore, 
physical surroundings which come to have meaning 
are usually made so through a series of social expe- 
riences. The appreciation of high school and college 
buildings, for example, represents an admixture of the 
appearance of the buildings, plus past experiences 
while attending high school and college. 
The Double Function of the Secondary School.—A. 
constant interrelation exists between the secondary 
school, and other aspects of the physical and social 
world of an individual. One aspect of the business of 
the secondary school is the direction of the community 
in its educational ideals and practices. Another as- 
pect of the business of the school is the reflection of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
18 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
  interests and needs of society. Taken as a whole 
throughout a series of years, the secondary school has, 
therefore, the twofold general function of directing 
and creating as well as reflecting, those aspects of 
meaningful experience which are regarded as most 
essential to the pupil’s welfare in the solution of life’s 
real problems. The secondary school as a social in- 
stitution thus represents a plexus of interests, some of 
which are the results of the influence of certain de- 
mands arising from environmental conditions, while 
others are the ideals to be approximated or fully 
realized by active members of society. 
Origin of Problems Due to Complex Environment.— 
The rapid evolution or appearance of school problems 
may be accounted for, in large part, by the changing 
and challenging complexity of environmental condi- 
tions. To list such problems in detail is to present a 
cross-section of those phases of school life that need to 
be considered in any attempt to agree upon fun- 
damentals. Most of the progress made in the field of 
secondary education has been comparatively recent. 
The development, for example, of the Latin grammar 
schools and of the earlier academies of America was 
comparatively slow. Most of the progress made in 
the public secondary education of America has oc- 
curred since the middle of the nineteenth century. 
The development of secondary school problems during 
the last quarter of the nineteenth, and the first quarter 
of the twentieth century, has been almost overwhelm- 
ingly great, due in large measure to the increasing 
complexity of our changing environment. 
Evidences of This Complexity—Many concrete evi-
-P-A-G-E-41
  IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING FUNDAMENTALS 19 
dences or examples of this growing complexity can be 
found in the nature of our secondary schools. A few 
of these are here indicated: Expensive, expansive 
and pretentious high school buildings and plants in- 
cluding library and laboratory equipments; extended 
provision of grounds to be used for general athletics 
and other outdoor exercises; ambitious lists of numer- 
ous courses of study representing all possible modes of 
human experience; organization and direction of health 
activities and other extra-curricular high school activ- 
ities. These are some of the definite evidences of the 
challenging complexity of current secondary education, 
and of the direct and indirect interrelations between 
changing environment and secondary school theory 
and practice. By way of contrast, one may think of 
the simplicity of the ‘‘little red school house on the 
hill’? as compared with the complexity of the present- 
day cosmopolitan high school, the buildings of which 
now cost a million dollars or more, while its curricular 
materials represent all of the great modes of expe- 
rience reflected in past and present life and its or- 
ganized domain has no narrow boundaries with ref- 
erence to extra-curricular activities. 
Necessity of Various Groups of Individuals 
Understanding These Fundamentals 
Enumeration of Groups.——Four groups of individu- 
als, at least, may profit from the broad study and 
survey of the fundamental principles and problems of 
secondary education. In the first place, large groups 
of students graduate from the high schools each year.
-P-A-G-E-42
20 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
  After two years of attendance at the various colleges 
and universities of the country, they are expected to 
begin to choose the lines or fields of their later major 
activities of study, or else of their non-academic life 
pursuits. Large groups of students are expected, at 
the end of the sophomore year to elect work in certain 
colleges. Some of them elect to enter the colleges of 
Education. Certain introductory courses have been 
outlined for these students who enter the colleges of 
Education. A course in fundamentals of secondary 
education may be presented in such a way as to serve 
as preparatory to certain other later secondary school 
courses to be pursued by them. This, perhaps, rep- 
resents the largest group of the four here suggested, 
who intend to make any definite study of Education as 
such. In the second place, another comparatively 
large group is constituted of high school instructors 
who have not made any special study of secondary 
education as such, either while doing undergraduate 
work in college or after graduating. In the third 
place, a group much more limited in number is con- 
stituted of graduate students who are capable of doing 
research work in secondary education. In the fourth 
place, a composite group is constituted of school board 
members and the lay-members or patrons in the com- 
munity who take a more or less aggressive and intel- 
ligent interest in school affairs. Through the simul- 
taneous and codperative study of Education by the 
above groups and by the subdivided groups of individ- 
uals represented, it will be possible to accelerate the 
progress of scientific secondary education.

Continuous Study Necessary, Due to Changing 
Conceptions and Changing Conditions of 
Secondary Education 
Dynamic-Mindedness Important——Since secondary 
school conditions are never static, it is necessary con- 
stantly to study and to evaluate aims, organization, 
subject matter and method. This spirit of dynamic- 
mindedness is important in order that the individual 
may be able to interpret and apply, under new condi- 
tions, certain guiding principles which have always 
been accepted as fundamental. New conditions also 
necessarily bring about the need for developing new 
concepts in education. The purpose of the next chap- 
ter is to discuss in a preliminary manner some of the 
changing aspects of secondary school objectives, con- 
tent of subject matter, methodology and external 
forms of school organization. Social surroundings 
and school situations are always changing their forms. 
Incessant educational inventories and evaluations must 
be made. All of this requires continuous study on the 
part of school theorists and administrators combined. 
General Résumé of Principles and Assumptions 
Importance of Reflective and Institutional Think- 
ing.—Briefly stated, the foregoing discussion has pro- 
posed certain general guiding principles and assump- 
tions. In substance they are as follows: In the first 
place, reflective thinking, experimentally tested when- 
ever possible, is essential to progress wherever edu- 
cational concepts and conditions are changing rapidly; 
in the second place, a knowledge of the secondary 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  22 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
school as a social institution in its entirety—the posses- 
sion of a so-called institutional sense—is necessary in 
order to give meaning to the differentiated aspects 
and specialized phases involved in a modern school; 
in the third place, since the secondary school and other 
phases of environment are reciprocally related, the 
twofold function of the school is to direct and reflect 
the interests, activities and ideals already existing, as 
well as to create new interests, desires, activities and 
ideals in various community centers; in the fourth 
place, constant study of principles and revision of 
practices is necessary on the part of all secondary 
school people, with the codperation of as many intelli- 
gent lay-members as possible, in order to adapt second- 
ary school work to the rapidly changing needs and 
demands of our industrial and social environment, as 
well as to outline educational policies that shall serve 
as guides to secondary school practice.

CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF SECONDARY 
EDUCATION: 
  Constantly Changing Conditions in General 
Some Concrete Evidences of Changing Conditions.— 
One does not need to reread the story of the twenty- 
year sleep of a Rip Van Winkle in order to sense the 
rapidly changing situations that occur during every 
decade or two. One is reminded of the non-permanent 
aspects of experience as a whole if he revisit the scenes 
of his childhood in either a rural or an urban center, 
after an absence of some years; or if he meet a friend 
from whom he has been separated since the elementary 
school days; or if he return to some institution of 
learning, secondary or higher, that has enlarged and 
grown since he left it; or, if he reflect upon a single 
item, such as the changed method of transportation 
since the days of the American Revolution; or if he 
reflect upon the newer developments in the field of 
science which have taken place within the span of one 
century or less. 
Turning from such a panoramic view as the above 
to a more limited field, it will be found upon analysis 
that something similar and analogous to the above 
transitions has been taking place in what have been 
usually known as aims, content, method and organi- 
zation in school affairs. This statement may be made 
24
-P-A-G-E-47
CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 25 
pertinently and with vigor in regard to the last three 
decades in the field of secondary education, because of 
the marked changes that have occurred. 
Inherited Terminology—We have inherited this 
fourfold terminology or classification of educational 
captions mentioned above, from the past history of 
education and the discussions pertaining thereto. 
These generic captions, namely, aims, content, method 
and organization, will serve as one of the suitable 
points of departure for further present-day discussions 
of the principles and problems of secondary education. 
As already suggested, the educational systems of the 
various countries of the world, from ancient to modern 
times, have been reviewed and discussed by many 
writers in terms of the above well-worn captions. In 
the discussion of modern secondary education, it is 
possible to catalog many of the outstanding tendencies 
under such modernized terminology, as objectives, new 
materials of instruction, technique of teaching and the 
junior-senior high school type of organization. 
Increased Number of Objectives in Secondary 
Education 
Tendency of Educators to State General Aims.— 
Aims, ends, and objectives will be regarded as synony- 
mous terms, then, for purposes of this discussion. 
The consciousness of general aims has always been 
regarded as important in the development of educa- 
tional systems in any country, according to educational 
. theorists. Every prominent educator of ancient and 
modern times has included in his writings at least  
-P-A-G-E-48
26 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
one outstanding aim of education as a whole. Evi- 
dence of this fact may be found in such notable edu- 
cational treatises as Plato’s Republic, Milton’s T'rrac- 
tate on Education, Comenius’s Didactic, Rousseau’s 
Emile, Spencer’s Education, and the like. The formu- 
lation of these general aims usually represented con- 
siderable reflective thinking on the part of educators. 
The contention is now made, however, by a number of 
leading educators that these earlier aims need to be 
re-evaluated, and in some instances supplemented. 
Increase of Both General and Specific Objectives.— 
The consciousness of this need of re-evaluating and of 
supplementing earlier educational aims has led to the 
recent addition to the previous number of objectives 
of secondary education. Some of these may be 
thought of as remote, or general; others, as immediate, 
or specific. A more detailed discussion of these will 
be given in later chapters. The word ‘‘objectives’’ is 
now widely accepted as a substitute for, or equivalent 
of, the word ‘‘aims.’’? The term ‘‘objectives’’ fur- 
nishes a convenient caption for representing one 
important aspect of our changing conceptions of 
secondary education, The objective of our original 
secondary education in America, established in the 
early part of the nineteenth century, was relatively 
simple in contrast to secondary school objectives as 
conceived by us at the present time, at the beginning 
of the twentieth century. In fact, it is known that the 
only dominant purpose of earlier secondary education 
was preparation for college. 
Reasons Accounting for the Earlier Simplicity of 
Purpose.—This earlier simplicity of purpose in the
-P-A-G-E-49
  CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 27 
field of secondary education in America was due to 
several conditions. In the first place, the number, and 
consequently the variety, of higher institutions of 
learning was limited. This condition remained prac- 
tically the same as late as the end of the eighteenth 
century. The domination of the influence of higher 
institutions of learning over secondary education was 
natural and obvious from the outset. There was only 
one way ahead for the secondary school graduate, 
namely, college-ward. 
The colleges of Harvard (1636), William and Mary 
(1692) and Yale (1700-1701) had already been estab- 
lished by the beginning of the eighteenth century. So 
few were these higher institutions of learning, how- 
ever, that it was quite natural that students should be 
prepared for them through the pursuit of a compara- 
tively limited number and range of courses. Clearly 
the setting of one of our present-day, never-ending 
discussions was here reflected; has secondary educa- 
tion any other function than to prepare graduates for 
entrance into the higher academic institutions of learn- 
ing? The first reason given above for the expression 
of only a single objective of secondary education was 
primarily academic in its nature. A second reason 
which may be suggested is somewhat more social in its 
nature, namely, the fact that social and environmental 
conditions of all kinds were not at that time nearly so 
complex as now. 
It should be remembered that college-trained indi- 
viduals during the eighteenth century, and even later, 
were prepared for relatively few professions or fields 
of activity. This accounts in some measure for the
-P-A-G-E-50
  
28 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
nature and limited range of curricular offerings in the 
higher institutions of learning, which in turn influenced 
the curricular offerings of the secondary schools. 
Some reason for caution against underestimating the 
virtue of the early simple purpose of secondary edu- 
cation exists because of the increasing emphasis which 
has been placed recently upon an increased number of 
objectives in secondary education. Unless the great- 
est amount of precaution is used, present discussion 
of objectives may result in the vagueness of thinking 
and procedure that we have been inclined to criticise 
in terms of the earlier aims. 
Under the earlier régime it is true that only one def- 
inite goal was set up, but the teaching done in order 
to reach this goal was frequently of a high type. On 
the other hand, it is justifiable, for reasons that will 
appear later, to insist that academic college prepara- 
tion should not now be the sole educational objective 
recognized by secondary schools. As will be shown, 
other objectives than college preparation should now 
be recognized. Groups of pupils who expect later to 
pursue liberal arts and science courses in higher in- 
stitutions need to be considered, but other groups of 
pupils who never will have an opportunity to pursue 
subjects in higher institutions of learning upon the 
completion or the non-completion of high school work 
need to be provided for intelligently. 
Factors Influencing Changing School Situations.— 
For example, at least four factors, which were not 
functioning in the earlier days to any large degree, are 
now operating to change the whole secondary school 
situation. The first of these factors is the extensive
-P-A-G-E-51
  
  CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 29 
and intensive division of labor in the fields of industry 
and commerce; the second, the new and more rapid 
means of travel and the accompanying increase in 
social contacts of people; the third, the improved and 
more efficient methods of recording and of communicat- 
ing ideas through a great variety of avenues, such as 
telephones, telegraphs and radios, newspapers, maga- 
zines and books ; the fourth, a composite of fundamental 
changing concepts in our educational thinking in re- 
lation to secondary school problems. The develop- 
ments in the fields of psychology and sociology, as well 
as in natural science, have done considerable to aid 
in the development of fundamental secondary school 
concepts in terms of methods, means and aims com- 
bined. 
Necessity for Knowing the Newer Objectives.—At a 
later point, the attempt to formulate the newer objec- 
tives will be indicated. In some instances, the formu- 
lation of objectives has been done by national or state 
committees; in others, largely through the individual 
efforts of specialists in the field of secondary education. 
Furthermore, it will also be shown that such objectives 
will have little practical value unless in some way sub- 
ject matter can be reformulated so as to furnish a 
means for the realization of them. These objectives 
should be well known by all secondary school officers 
and instructors and, in so far as is possible, by aggres- 
sive members of boards of education, as well as by 
active lay-members and patrons who are capable of 
doing constructive educational thinking. Codéperation 
of some sort among the groups here mentioned is 
essential in order to facilitate the means and methods
-P-A-G-E-52
  30 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
used for the purpose of realizing these objectives in 
schoolroom practice. 
The Current Issues Related to Educational Objec- 
tives—Two interrelated and important issues grow 
out of the problem of secondary school objectives. 
One of these has to do with the method of determining 
the objectives, the other with the nature and number 
of the objectives themselves as applied to the curric- 
ulum. Recent emphasis has been placed upon the 
analysis of activities as they exist, for the purpose of 
determining objectives. In some instances this has 
been characterized as the job-analysis method. Critics 
have insisted that the proponents of this method of 
determining objectives have overlooked the analysis 
of the activities and ideals that ought to exist, or be 
included in educational aims. If it be assumed that a 
part of the function of education is to develop and 
create wholesome desires, as well as analyze the desires 
already being expressed, it seems fair to recognize that 
the nature of objectives and the method of determining 
them should take into account life activities, physical, 
mental and social, not only as they now exist, but also 
as they ought to exist. 
New Materials of Instruction in Relation to 
Educational Objectives 
General Relation between Objectives and Subject 
Matter.—The nature of the materials of instruction 
used in education should be largely determined by the 
nature of the objectives agreed upon. Materials of 
instruction constitute the chief means of realizing |
-P-A-G-E-53
CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 31 
objectives. Whenever the old objectives are modified, 
or new ones added, the necessity for rebuilding cur- 
ricula and reshaping subject matter to be taught 
becomes apparent. The nature of the content of sub- 
ject matter has always occupied a relatively large 
place in educational literature, but in practice it has 
not always been outlined in conformity with the 
avowed aims set up. 
In the case of elementary education, subject matter 
corresponding to the three R’s has been almost uni- 
versally stressed in all countries. These more formal 
and routine aspects have been, for the most part, 
dominantly emphasized in American elementary edu- 
cation. In addftion to these routine aspects during 
recent years, social studies and life activities have 
been incorporated much more widely in American ele- 
mentary education. 
The Earlier Humanistic Content of Secondary School 
Curricula—In the case of secondary education the 
world over, including ancient, medieval and modern 
times, the classical content, composed of Latin and 
Greek studies, has unquestionably predominated. 
This situation remained primarily so until well into 
the nineteenth century. Here and there in European 
countries the scientific interest of the seventeenth cen- 
tury did have some influence on the nature of secondary 
school curricula. After the beginning of the nine- 
teenth century, science content was gradually added 
to the classical. As will be indicated later, this strug- 
gle between humanism, or emphasis upon the classics, 
and realism, or emphasis upon science and other mod- 
ern studies, was continued up into the fourth quarter
-P-A-G-E-54
  32 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of the nineteenth century both in European and 
American secondary schools. 
The Widening and Enrichment of Secondary School 
Curricula—At present, the situation is very much 
altered. Social studies, practical arts, fine arts and 
school activities have been added. Secondary school 
curricula now, presumably, are intended to represent 
cross-sections of the whole of human interests and ex- 
perience rather than mere sectors in terms of but one 
dominant subject or more. This changed conception 
is usually expressed as expanded curricula, or enriched 
courses of study. 
Rebuilding curricula represents one of the most gi- 
gantic problems of secondary education. This task 
will require a great amount of time. Mature judgment 
will be needed in order to determine with any degree of 
reliability at what points reorganization of traditional 
materials is most profitable, and what material should 
be added to the subject matter now taught. The co- 
operation of specialists in curriculum construction 
with secondary school officers and instructors will be 
necessary in the reformulation of secondary school 
materials. Teacher participation in this phase of 
secondary school work has already begun to be put 
into operation in some parts of the country. 
In order to administer the newer program of studies 
successfully, the principle of unity in the subject mat- 
ter outlined for the elementary school, secondary 
school and higher institutions of learning must be 
recognized. Otherwise great waste, duplication and 
costly errors will ensue. The principle of unity and 
   
-P-A-G-E-55
  
  CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 33 
its various applications will also be discussed in a later 
chapter of this text. 
Re-evaluation of All High School Subjects—High 
school subjects and their corresponding subject matter 
will necessarily need to be re-evaluated. This deter- 
mination of values should include a survey of all school 
subjects. No single subject of the secondary school 
can now have a monopoly on the curriculum market. 
Both the old and the new, the academic and the practi- 
cal school subjects, should be re-canvassed and included 
when attempts are made to formulate subjects in terms 
of educational objectives. Along with this conception 
of newer materials of instruction, a new duty of the 
secondary school must develop. It is obliged to do 
more than accept the ready-made curriculum clothes of 
the colleges. It is now a recognized duty of every 
modern secondary school to rebuild or reconstruct 
curricula and subject matter best adapted to both the 
common and the differentiated needs of its pupils. In 
a democracy of the American type, this is the only 
alternative. It remains for America to show how suc- 
cessfully secondary education can be given to all 
persons. 
The Technique of High School Teaching 
Introduction.—Changing conceptions of secondary 
education have appeared in relation to methods of 
teaching as well as in relation to aims and subject mat- 
ter. In some instances the phrase ‘‘technique of 
teaching’’ has been substituted for the earlier phrase
-P-A-G-E-56
  34 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
used throughout the history of education, namely, 
methods of high school teaching. 
Forms of General Method.—The discussion of the 
problem of method has been prominent in some form 
or other ever since ancient times. The aspect known 
as general method, historically speaking, developed 
first. The two large aspects of general method 
throughout medieval and modern times were the in- 
ductive and deductive. Throughout the Middle Ages 
the deductive method of teaching was dominant. Dur- 
ing the seventeenth century the inductive method, due 
to the discussions of Bacon and others, came into 
prominence. The procedure represented by the de- 
ductive method was to begin the teaching process with 
generalized statements or principles. In the inductive 
procedure, the reverse order of beginning with specific 
and particular instances and, through these, arriving 
at generalized statements, was practiced. 
Most of the discussions of general method in the 
past have been confined, directly or indirectly, to 
these two aspects of induction or deduction. Further- 
more, elementary school method was by far the most 
prominently represented in these earlier discussions. 
During the nineteenth century, the Herbartian five 
formal steps of instruction became widely discussed in 
Europe and America. The discussion of these steps 
of instruction by the Herbartians themselves, and by 
others, was confined very largely to elementary school 
teaching. 
Development of General High School Method.— 
General methods of teaching in the high schools de- 
veloped slowly in America. General methods, some-
-P-A-G-E-57
CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 35 
  times known as principles of teaching, are closely 
connected with the problems of educational psychology. 
With the development of educational psychology, such 
problems as individual differences of pupils, the best 
methods of presenting subject matter to groups of 
pupils possessing differing capacities and a knowledge 
by high school teachers of the learning processes of 
pupils and different types of learning came to the fore- 
ground. The general technique of teaching involves 
also a knowledge of certain mental reactions made by 
high school pupils when subject matter is presented 
to them, so that in the light of modern psychology it 
has been possible to supplement the earlier discussions 
of method. 
Development of Special Methods of High School 
Instruction.—In addition to the general technique of 
teaching, however, special methods of high school 
teaching have developed during recent years. In- 
creased interest has been shown during the last ten 
years in the methods of teaching English, science, 
mathematics, history, foreign languages and so forth, 
as it has been recognized that the different groups of 
high school subjects have correspondingly different 
techniques. 
Experimentation as the Basis of Method.—To a very 
limited degree, some experimental bases have been 
determined with reference to the best methods of pre- 
senting certain subject matter. Since the teaching 
and the learning processes are always closely related, 
analyses should be made, in much more detail, of just 
how pupils do learn foreign languages, mathematics, 
sciences and other high school subjects. Experimen-
-P-A-G-E-58
  36 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tation leading to reliable analyses of the pupil’s 
learning processes would undoubtedly lead to an im- 
proved adaptation of teaching to varying abilities and 
needs of pupils. 
It is an error to assume that the problem of second- 
ary school method is easy and simple, and therefore 
inconsequential. Wherever laboratory or experimen- 
tal high schools have attempted to work out a technique 
of teaching in terms of the ‘‘mastery’’ of knowledge, 
rather than ‘‘half learning’’ on the part of pupils, a 
great service has been rendered to high school method- 
ology. 
Résumé.—It has been pointed out that the earlier 
general discussion of high school method involving the 
inductive and deductive aspects has been supplemented 
with other approaches, based in part upon experi- 
mental data relative to individual differences and so 
forth. Furthermore, a dominant second tendency in 
the newer conception of method is to be found in the 
development of a technique of teaching relative to each 
group of high school subjects. 
The Lengthened Junior-Senior Cycle Type of High 
School Organization 
Six Years of Secondary Education at Least—In 
conjunction with the development of changing con- 
ceptions of aims, subject matter and method, is to be 
found the recent idea of extending the period of second- 
ary school instruction from four years to six years in 
length, at least, and of modifying the external organi-
-P-A-G-E-59
  . CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 37 
zation of the eight-four type into some form of the 
junior-senior high school type of organization. 
Some of the outstanding assumptions of numerous 
educators are that the period of secondary education 
should be at least six years in length, that it should be 
constituted of two closely related cycles and that this 
type of instruction should begin two years earlier than 
is customary under the traditional eight-four plan. 
The above conviction was expressed by members of 
prominent educational committees before the close of 
the nineteenth century, especially during the nineties. 
In some instances, individuals have suggested that 
when conditions warrant it, secondary education should 
be so organized as to include the first two years of the 
college. Such reorganization is known now as the 
junior college. This will later on be given fuller con- 
sideration. 
Various Forms of Organization in Terms of Years.— 
The junior-senior high school represents very strik- 
ingly the changing concept of the external form of 
organization. More than a dozen different forms of 
junior high schools, or non-eight-four types of schools, 
have come into existence throughout the United States 
asawhole. Some differences exist between the various 
forms of organization, as, for example, the variations 
from the six-three-three-type which will be discussed 
again later on. There is general agreement on the 
fact, however, in the majority of the states, that ele- 
mentary education should terminate at the end of the 
sixth grade. The proponents of this plan contend that 
six years is enough time in which to master the routine 
work of the tool and other elementary school subjects.
-P-A-G-E-60
38 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
  The Termination of Elementary Education at the End 
of the Sixth Grade.—It is contended by certain advo- 
cates that the period of secondary education should 
begin at the beginning of the seventh grade and 
continue at least to the end of the twelfth. In this 
instance, six years of elementary and six years of 
secondary education would equal a total of twelve 
years, similar to the total under the eight-four plan. 
However, between the eight-four plan and the non- 
eight-four plans, there is a variance of two years in 
the time at which elementary education ends. Certain 
committees have advocated in the past that in the name 
of economy of time, the total elementary-high school 
period might be shortened by one or more years. 
Proponents of the junior high school idea, in their 
eagerness to get the movement on the way, have often, 
perhaps, overstressed the mere external form or type 
of organization. It should be granted that this aspect 
is not the only practical consideration. Nevertheless, 
high school reorganization and administration will 
necessitate reckoning with the total number of years, 
and the desirable length of the cycle divisions to be 
included. 
Achievement of Results as a Constant Measure.— 
The current contention among educators that achieve- 
ment of results by high school pupils rather than the 
mere time element should be made the measure of 
progress is worthy of serious consideration. The 
above contention is justifiable. Nevertheless, admin- 
istratively considered, it is necessary to recognize the 
time element in terms of years as a part of school 
machinery. The tendency to make exaggerated claims
-P-A-G-E-61
  CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 39 
for revolutionary practices in the name of the junior 
high school movement is unwarranted. On the other 
hand, many schools not dubbed junior high schools 
have revised their practices so as to meet many of the 
claims of, and utilize arguments made in favor of, the 
junior high school idea. Such reorganized institutions 
should be included in one’s thinking of the changing 
conceptions of modern junior-senior high schools. 
Summary Statement.—The problems suggested un- 
der the four generic captions—aims, subject matter, 
method and organization—overlap. They are so in- 
terrelated that in practice no one of these will appear 
without affecting the others. It is necessary to keep 
in mind that the number of educational objectives has 
increased beyond that of preparation for college; that 
new materials of instruction have been added to the 
earlier classical content; that in addition to general 
method, special methods of high school teaching have 
been devised; that the junior-senior high school plan 
of organization has made it possible to modify the na- 
ture of work done in the eight-four plan. Additional 
objectives, new materials of instruction and revised 
techniques of teaching under the junior-senior type of 
organization represent a list of changing conceptions 
that are expressing themselves wholesomely in modern 
secondary education.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE PROFESSIONAL STUDY VERSUS THE 
POPULAR VIEW OF EDUCATION 
Education in General Distinguished from Education 
as a Special Study 
Introductory Statement.—The purposes in Chapter 
IV are: To indicate what is meant by the so-called 
professional study of secondary education; to point out 
that the concept of professionalized Education has 
had a gradual historical development; to indicate a 
tendency toward a multiplication of differentiated 
courses in Education; to characterize the general na- 
ture of standardizing agencies in the professional 
training of teachers in secondary schools; to indicate 
the desirability of evaluating the various courses and 
subject matter offered, so as to avoid undue duplica- 
tion of undergraduate work; and to suggest that 
foundations be created and amply financed for carry- 
ing on further research in secondary education. 
Much of the lack of faith in the possibility of making 
the professional training of teachers in secondary 
schools a success is due to the lack of clarity in the 
terminology used by educators. Acquaintanceship on 
the part of the layman with the nature and meaning of 
Education as a technical or professional study will 
reduce unwarranted criticism and lack of sympathy. 
42
-P-A-G-E-65
  
PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 43 
The general import of this chapter is to attempt to 
make definite the characteristics of secondary educa- 
tion as a study, and to reduce meaningless terminology 
toaminimum. Frequently high school graduates have 
not had any opportunity to acquaint themselves with 
the facts concerning the requirements in the teaching 
profession until they have been enrolled in college for 
a year or more. This condition frequently exists and 
is one justification for the discussion that follows. 
Furthermore, it is seldom that all the members of the 
faculties of our colleges and universities have a clear 
knowledge of the purposes of the study of Education. 
To a still greater extent it is true that the public in 
general rarely knows any of the significant phases of 
this problem. Because of the limited technical knowl- 
edge of Education possessed by various groups, the 
presentation of the facts given here has considerable 
justification. 
Possibilities of a Science and a Philosophy of Edu- 
cation.—During the latter part of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, many magazine articles were published concern- 
ing the possibility of developing a science of education. 
About the first quarter of the century, Froebel’s Edu- 
cation of Man (1826) was published. And later on 
Rosenkranz’s Philosophy of Education (1848) and 
Harris’s Psychological Foundations of Education 
(1898) appeared. The above-named books gave ex- 
pression to what became known as a philosophy of 
education with no conscious attempt, however, to 
separate the discussion of the principles applying 
respectively to elementary and to secondary education 
as such. Some of the material in these treatises was

quite intellectualistic and abstract in nature, and there- 
fore difficult to apply in practice. Other parts of them 
foreshadowed some of the present-day fundamentals 
relating to the principles of elementary and secondary 
education. For example, the psychological nature of 
the pupil was analyzed, and the content of subject 
matter was discussed in terms of groups of subjects 
best adapted to meeting the needs of pupils at different 
stages in Harris’s Psychological Foundations of Edu- 
cation, 
During the last quarter of the century, there ap- 
peared also a series of articles in well-known mag- 
azines, discussing the possibility of formulating a 
science of education and including, usually, some state- 
ment of the general aims of education. An outstand- 
ing attempt of this series of articles was to show that 
principles of education are necessarily developed out 
of fundamentals based upon biology, psychology and 
sociology. These earlier discussions helped, no doubt, 
to prepare the way, toward the end of the century, for 
a widespread interest in the professional study of both 
elementary and secondary education. 
Popular Discussions of Education—In addition to 
the above discussions, there appeared in newspapers 
and magazines, during these same years, numerous 
articles of a much more popular nature concerning 
current educational problems. Some of these articles 
were enlightening and others were not. Numerous 
suggestions and theories were proposed, most of which 
had not been tested experimentally in any way. Most 
of these popular discussions made no distinction be- 
tween the use of the term ‘‘education’’ in its wide, 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
  PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 45 
general sense, and its more narrow and technical sense. 
Such articles are still appearing constantly. 
The Use of the Term “Education” in a Technical 
Sense.—During recent decades, the term ‘‘ Hducation”’ 
has come to be used in a more restricted and technical 
sense among educators than formerly. It is with this 
more restricted sense that the present discussion has 
to do. ‘‘Hducation,’’ as used in the more general 
sense by many writers, has usually referred to all of 
the formal schooling received by an individual, from 
the beginning of his elementary schooling to the end of 
his training in higher institutions of learning. 
In contrast to this general meaning, the term ‘‘Eidu- 
cation,’’ when used in its more restricted sense, refers 
to the attempt to study principles, problems and 
processes relative to the different units or stages of 
the school system in as systematic, analytical and 
scientific a manner as possible. No one is more con- 
scious of the limitations of such an attempt than is the 
expert student of, or so-called specialist in, Education. 
The limitations are obvious, both because of the new- 
ness of the field and because of the complex nature of 
the educative process. This confession that only a 
beginning has been made is no justifiable basis, how- 
ever, for the assertion frequently made by speakers 
and writers that nothing of any value whatever has yet 
been accomplished in the name of the so-called sci- 
entific study of elementary or of secondary education. 
Professional Training of Teachers.—One large and 
important phase of the study of Education as such 
consists of what is now known as the professional 
training of teachers in the elementary and secondary 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  46 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
schools. Incidentally, it is pertinent to remark, at this 
point, that the conviction is growing among educators 
that teachers in the higher institutions of learning 
should be trained professionally, especially up to the 
end of the first two years of college, as well as teachers 
in all the-grades of school work below the junior college 
stage. It is commonly said among college students 
that many of them received better instruction while 
attending standardized high schools than they received 
later on, during their first years of attendance in the 
higher institutions of learning. Such testimony is by 
no means rare, and, though in part unreliable, is never- 
theless worthy of serious consideration. 
Comparison of the Terms “Pedagogy” and “Edu- 
cation.”—The term ‘‘pedagogy”’ as first used in this 
country referred predominantly to classroom pro- 
cedure and school management. The term ‘‘Educa- 
tion,’’ as now used, implies a wider generic meaning 
than merely classroom procedure. The term ‘‘ped- 
agogy’’ did, later on, however, come to have a some- 
what enlarged meaning, and included such courses of 
study as history of education, philosophy of education, 
schoolroom management, methods and child psychol- 
ogy. The scope of the study of Education, at present, 
has been considerably enlarged beyond that of the 
original field of the so-called earlier pedagogy. 
Some of the Newer Aspects of Education.—Some of 
these newer aspects have come to be characterized, 
for example, as general intelligence tests, educational 
achievement tests, surveys of school systems, exper- 
imentation and research of various kinds, principles 
of education, educational psychology and general and
-P-A-G-E-69
  
PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 47 
  special techniques of teaching in different school sub- 
jects. Most of these phases apply to the fields of both 
elementary and secondary education. The term 
‘‘Hducation’’ is now used to designate in a generic 
way the systematic study of educational principles, 
problems, processes and practices of many varieties. 
So rapidly have these phases developed—perhaps too 
rapidly at times to be wholly effective—that scores of 
courses, applicable respectively to the elementary and 
the secondary school, are now offered in the different 
departments and schools of Education throughout the 
United States. 
General Historical Development of the Professional 
Study of Education 
Early Emphasis upon the Professional Phase of 
School Subjects.—Sometimes it has been erroneously 
asserted by lay-critics of Education that the emphasis 
upon the professional aspect of school subjects studied 
is of very recent origin. Professional, or at any rate, 
semi-professional training in school subjects has ex- 
isted for along time. The study of Latin, for example, 
in the earlier days, especially during the period of the 
Middle Ages, was regarded very largely as a pro- 
fessional subject rather than as a merely academic one. 
Latin was taught as a professional subject, because of 
the practical use made of it in the interpretation of 
church doctrines, as well as in other fields of endeavor. 
This analogy will serve as the basis of the thesis that 
whenever any school subject is studied in relation to 
teaching, the professional emphasis is essential.
-P-A-G-E-70
48 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Emphasis upon Methodology Since Ancient Times.— 
The history of methodology may be traced out in a 
number of instances. In ancient times, the Socratic 
method of teaching was developed. This method, in 
either its original or its modified form, has been widely 
used, at times, since the age of Socrates, especially by 
those persons who were expert and adept enough in 
the technique of instruction to use it. So influential 
was this method that almost every modern textbook 
written on methods of teaching in elementary or sec- 
ondary schools has referred either directly or indi- 
rectly to it. 
Professional Use of Subjects by the Sophists in 
Their Secondary Schools.—Even the group of teachers 
known as Sophists, of pre-Socratic days, were accus- 
tomed to teach subjects to leaders for the purpose of 
spreading their convictions relative to the solution of 
certain social and political problems. To be sure, 
their method was often crude and unreliable in com- 
parison with present-day techniques of presentation. 
Nevertheless, the tendency to methodize instruction 
has a long history which has paved the way in some 
respects for present-day discussions. Later on, the 
church of the Middle Ages attempted to prepare 
teachers for the avowed purpose of interpreting and 
preserving their doctrines and creeds. 
Two Earlier Phases of General Method.—The prob- 
lem of general method, in either its deductive or its 
inductive form, has expressed itself in both the 
medieval and the modern periods of the history of 
education. The deductive approach predominated 
until the seventeenth century, at which time the in- 
   
-P-A-G-E-71
  
PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 49 
ductive method of teaching also became prominent. 
The chief purpose of this brief discussion of methodol- 
ogy is to show that the history of that part of the pro- 
fessional study of Education known as method is very 
old. 
European Emphasis upon the Professional Aspects 
During the Nineteenth Century.—In a brief and 
general way, it is pertinent to remark that the profes- 
sional training of teachers has become gradually more 
and more prominent in Europe as well as in America 
during the nineteenth century and thereafter. Stu- 
dents of the history of education are aware of the fact 
that the leading countries of Europe have, in the past, 
insisted upon a thorough professional training, as well 
as an academic one, on the part of all of their instruc- 
tors in secondary or higher schools. Brief reference 
will be made to these facts later on, in the discussion 
of European secondary education. 
Professional Training Emphasized by Early Amer- 
ican Academies and High Schools.—In America, the 
earlier academies and high schools made an effort to 
offer a meager amount of professional training for 
teachers. Sometimes, this was provided by means of 
a few so-called normal courses in which a conscious 
effort was made to adapt the teaching of academic 
subject matter to the needs of pupils through their 
most successful and best-trained teachers. Later on, 
in other instances, separate institutions known as nor- 
mal schools, private and public, whose chief concern 
was professional training of teachers, were established. 
Professional training offered in high schools and nor- 
mal schools was intended primarily for elementary  
-P-A-G-E-72
  50 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
teachers. Later on, departments of Education were 
organized within those higher institutions of learning 
known as colleges or universities. The chief purpose 
of these, originally, was the professional training of 
teachers in secondary schools. One of the pioneer ef- 
forts made to organize such a department of Education 
occurred during the seventies of the nineteenth cen- 
tury in the University of Michigan. In more recent 
times, departments and schools of Education have been 
very generally organized in both the private and pub- 
lic colleges and universities of the United States. 
Granting of Degrees by Colleges of Education.—In 
some instances, these schools of Education, the chief 
function of which is the professional training of 
teachers in secondary schools, have been organized 
within the liberal arts colleges, and in other instances 
separately. In certain instances, the schools of Edu- 
cation grant separate bachelors’ degrees, and other 
higher degrees, on a par with those granted in the sci- 
ence and arts colleges. In other instances, degrees are 
granted within the liberal arts, or the science and arts 
colleges. 
Four-Year Normal Teachers’ Colleges Since 1910.— 
The most significant recent tendency in the United 
States relative to the professional training of teachers 
is the tendency of the normal schools to resolve them- 
selves into four-year standardized teachers’ colleges. 
It was customary for many years, as previously sug- 
gested, for a large number of the normal schools to con- 
fine their training of teachers to the elementary schools. 
Many normal schools, at that time, offered but two or 
three years of work beyond the high school. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 51 
tendency for normal schools to resolve themselves into 
teachers’ colleges, and to extend the work offered to 
four years instead of continuing the practice of having 
two years only, has developed chiefly since the year 
1910. Persons connected with scores of the stronger 
normal schools, as has been evidenced at times in the 
discussions in the educational conferences of recent 
years, now believe in the extended four-year program 
of teacher training. 
Obviously, this tendency indicates that the province 
of the training of teachers in the stronger normal 
schools has been extended so as to include the teaching 
corps of secondary schools, as well as of the elementary 
schools. The four year teachers’ colleges now grant 
degrees, in many instances on a par, presumably, with 
the degrees granted by the schools of Education es- 
tablished in other types of higher institutions of 
learning. 
Some Evidences of Increased Interest in Profes- 
sional Training.—The objective evidences of this in- 
creased current interest in the technical, systematic 
and professional study of Education are many. One, 
only, of these evidences is here suggested. A very 
large group—thousands of men and women, as is at- 
tested by the phenomenal enrollment during the sum- 
mer school session and during the regular scholastic 
year, in our higher institutions of learning—now be- 
lieve, confidently, that it is just as essential to offer 
professional training to teachers and to other high 
school officers and to require it too, as it is to offer 
and require professional training in the cases of law- 
yers, doctors, clergymen, journalists, business men,
-P-A-G-E-74
  52 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
agriculturalists and engineers. Professional training 
of teachers should be offered and required for the sake 
of the high school pupil, as well as for the sake of 
standardizing the profession of secondary education 
asa whole. This contention is more readily and more 
intelligently assented to now than it was a quarter of 
a century ago, by both the more academically minded 
and by the more vigorous proponents of the necessity 
of a thoroughgoing professional training for all sec- 
ondary administrators and teachers. 
Professional Training of High School Principals— 
In the past, only a very small percentage of under- 
graduates definitely trained themselves for the po- 
sition of high school principal. An increasing number 
of principals have begun to elect Education as a major 
during their graduate study. Many principals now 
have done some professional study in specific courses 
in Education. Evidences are seen of this in a study 
recently made by Professor Koos of the training of 
421 principals. In a summarized table, he shows that 
a range of from ten to seventy-nine percent of high 
school principals is represented in the study of specific 
courses in Education. Out of a list of twenty-five 
courses tabulated, approximately sixty-six percent of 
the principals had studied principles of secondary 
education; forty-seven percent, high school curric- 
ulum; sixty-six percent, high school administration; 
seventeen percent, the junior high school; twenty-five 
percent, the psychology of high school subjects; and 
twenty-eight percent, the psychology of adolescence. 
The other nineteen specific courses pursued by high 
school principals were history of education, principles
-P-A-G-E-75
  PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 53 
of education, philosophy of education, curriculum, 
elementary-school curriculum, educational sociology, 
city-school administration, supervision, general meth- 
ods, special methods, practice teaching, educational 
psychology, educational measurements, mental meas- 
urements, experimental education, statistical methods, 
industrial and vocational education, vocational guid- 
ance and foreign school systems. It is manifest from 
the above list of professional subjects studied that 
principals are receiving a larger amount of profes- 
sional training now than previously. 
Confusion of Thinking and Educational Prejudice 
Hinder Progress—A considerable number of lay- 
members in Education have not as yet conceded the 
value and scope of this newer and more careful study 
of Education. A great amount of confusion in edu- 
cational writing, speaking and thinking, as well as 
much ungrounded and unealled-for prejudice, has come 
about because of the lack of clarity of many persons 
actually engaged in secondary school work, as well as 
because of a lack of real knowledge of the meaning of 
Education in its restricted sense on the part of lay- 
members. This confusion in thinking and this more 
or less unwarranted prejudice have been most unfor- 
tunate because of the actual delay in educational prog- 
ress which has surely resulted therefrom. It has 
taken natural scientists a long time to develop a body 
of sound theory in their own fields. It is even much 
more difficult to form and establish fundamentals in 
the field of secondary education. The task is similar 
in many respects to that found in the changing aspects 
of any other social science. Only by laboring at the
-P-A-G-E-76
  54 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
task in the spirit in which the real scientist works will 
it be possible to make the technical study of secondary 
education bring forth more and more accurate results 
in the near future. 
The Tendency towards Differentiation in All Fields 
Including Education 
Differentiation in Secondary Education.—Differen- 
tiation of knowledge has gone on with great rapidity 
in all fields. Analogously, the same thing has hap- 
pened in the province of Education. Elementary, 
secondary and higher education represent connected 
cycles of our educational system which now demand 
expert knowledge of these specialized fields. Not only 
is this true, but secondary education itself is now be- 
ginning to be differentiated into the theories, for ex- 
ample, of high school administration, of supervision, 
of the technique of teaching, of curriculum making and 
so forth. Training for each of these fields of work is 
essential. 
General Analogy Between Differentiation in Natural 
Science and in Education.—Students of the history of 
science and of the history of philosophy are cognizant 
of the fact that in ancient times science and philos- 
ophy, and even religion, often represented undifferen- 
tiated bodies of the problems of knowledge. The 
majority of the problems discussed by the ancient 
philosophers were cosmological in nature, having to do 
with the physical universe. The problems discussed 
by the more modern philosophers have been more an-
-P-A-G-E-77
PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 55 
thropological in nature, having to do with the human 
world. Great thinkers, such as Aristotle, attempted 
to discuss problems belonging both to cosmology and 
to anthropology. This was likewise true of some of 
the great thinkers of more modern times, such as Kant 
and Spencer. 
It is a noteworthy fact that modern science has now 
been differentiated into a great variety of aspects. 
The different sciences, such as botany, zodlogy, chemis- 
try and physics originally developed out of what was, 
at one time, considered as a generic body of knowledge 
characterized as natural philosophy. Furthermore, 
chemistry and physics, and botany and zodlogy, for ex- 
ample, have now been developed into still further spe- 
cialized aspects. It is necessary to break up knowl- 
edge into many aspects in order to analyze and 
understand it. But no one individual pretends to be a 
final authority on all of these modern phases of science 
today. Such mastery, at any rate, is possible for only 
the exceptional individual, or the limited few. 
Differentiation in Social Sciences, and in Indus- 
try—This same tendency toward differentiation of 
knowledge has appeared in other fields, such as the 
social sciences, though naturally it has been developed 
with somewhat less accuracy. Again, the same tend- 
ency has been paralleled by a high degree of special- 
ization in the industrial world. Such differentiation 
has gradually and inevitably come about because of 
the complexity of modern life in all of its aspects, 
theoretical and practical. Much the same thing as has 
happened in the natural and social sciences has oc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
56 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
eurred in the field of Education. Scores of differ- 
entiated courses have been developed during the last 
half century within the departments and colleges of 
Education. To all persons who have observed the 
historical development of professional Education in the 
United States, it is.apparent that a rapid differentia- 
tion of the content of courses has gone on. At the 
present time, there is a mass of accumulated material 
which has been labeled under a great variety of names 
of courses offered in the various institutions through- 
out the country. As in science, so in Education, it is 
impossible for any one individual to presume to speak 
on all aspects with equally final authority, although, 
in contrast to science, research in the field of Educa- 
tion is very new. Administratively considered how- 
ever, the multiplicity of courses offered in Education 
does call for much precaution lest they become mean- 
ingless, due in part to mere duplication and over- 
lapping of work offered on non-increasing or non- 
progressive levels or sequences. 
Specialists in Education Necessary.—The kinder- 
garten, the elementary school, the secondary school 
and the higher institutions of learning in America have 
developed far enough now to require that each of these 
phases be studied by specialists. Unfortunately, in- 
dividuals sometimes attempt to pronounce judgments 
upon the fundamentals of secondary education, or 
upon stages and cycles, with considerable authority, 
though they have given very little attention and se- 
rious reflection to underlying principles and conse- 
quential problems.

Standardization of the Professional Training of 
Teachers in Secondary Schools 
Types of Standardizing Agencies—Several va- 
rieties of agencies for standardizing the professional 
training of teachers in secondary schools exist. These 
may be characterized as inter-state associations, ex- 
amples of which are the North Central Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools and the corresponding 
associations of the New England, Southern and North- 
western states; state departments of public instruc- 
tion; state institutions of higher learning, including 
universities and normal teachers’ colleges ; and depart- 
ments of Education in denominational colleges and 
universities. Another type of classification might be 
made in terms of advisory and mandatory character. 
Recommendations of the North Central Association 
would represent the first of these, and state legislation 
of the departments of Education, the second. 
Scope and Nature of the North Central Association 
of Colleges and Secondary Schools.—The North Cen- 
tral Association is the largest of the above agencies for 
standardizing secondary schools. It includes institu- 
tions in almost a score of states. At the present time 
these are: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, In- 
diana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, 
Oklahoma, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin 
and Wyoming. In 1923, the Association included in 
its membership a total of more than 1,500 secondary 
schools and approximately 200 colleges. 
General Nature of Standards.—This Association,
-P-A-G-E-80
  58 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
and the three located in New England, the South and 
the Northwest, respectively, attempted to standardize 
certain aspects of the secondary school, such as, for 
example: Buildings, library and laboratory equip- 
ment, the organization and administration of the num- 
ber of units for graduation, the length of the school 
year, the minimum professional training and prepara- 
tion of teachers, the teaching load in terms of number 
of classes taught and length of recitation period and 
the program of studies in terms of units of subject 
matter offered in all of the separate groups of high 
school subjects. The standards outlined by these four 
inter-state associations are not mandatory or required. 
Schools may be admitted upon application whenever 
they are able to meet the standards agreed upon by 
these associations. Once these schools do elect to join 
the associations, however, they are obliged to fulfill 
certain requirements or keep up to certain standards. 
Minimum Professional Training and Courses Recom- 
mended.—The minimum amount of professional train- 
ing required of teachers and supervisors of academic 
subjects has been for some time eleven semester hours 
in Education. This requirement will be changed soon. 
Beginning with September, 1925, according to recent 
action and vote by members of the North Central As- 
sociation, the minimum amount of professional train- 
ing will be altered from eleven to fifteen semester 
hours. The academic training of teachers and super- 
visors must be equal to four years of study beyond the 
high school, or a total of at least 120 semester hours. 
The North Central Association designates or recom- 
mends certain type courses, which will serve to meet
-P-A-G-E-81
PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 59 
the spirit of the above professional standard. These 
are as follows: Educational psychology, educational 
sociology, history of education, school administration 
and supervision, principles of secondary education, 
theory of teaching, observation and practice teaching 
and special methods of high school subjects. In order 
that the special methods of the teaching of high school 
subjects may technically be given credit they must be 
listed in college catalogs under courses offered in 
Education. At present the minimum requirement con- 
cerning professional training applies to instructors in 
secondary schools. The question as to whether this 
same standard should be applied to instructors in 
higher institutions of learning has been debated a 
number of times, formally and informally, at the 
annual conferences of the North Central Association, 
which are held each year in the month of March. 
State Department of Education Requirements in 
Professional Training—Most state departments of 
public instruction stipulate definitely, and in a manda- 
tory manner, the minimum number of hours required 
in the professional training of teachers. These re- 
quirements change from time to time, so that one’s 
statement may not be up-to-date by the time it finds its 
way into print. The total number of hours required 
by the state departments of Education to obtain life 
certificates varies in the different states from approx- 
imately ten hours as the minimum to thirty as a max- 
imum. The status at the present time, with reference 
to states belonging to the North Central Association, is 
as follows: Arizona requires eighteen semester hours; 
Colorado, thirty; Illinois, twelve; Indiana, thirty;
-P-A-G-E-82
  60 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Iowa, fourteen plus six in psychology; Kansas, fifteen; 
Michigan, fifteen; Missouri, eighteen; Minnesota, fif- 
teen; Montana, eleven; Nebraska, twelve; North Da- 
kota, sixteen; New Mexico, twenty-one; Ohio, twenty- 
four; Oklahoma, sixteen; South Dakota, fifteen; 
Wisconsin, twelve; and Wyoming, twelve. 
Illinois State Requirements.—The stipulation of 
definite courses as optional or required, out of the 
total number of hours, varies within the different 
states. For example, until recently the State of Illi- 
nois required a total of but nine hours. At the pres- 
ent time twelve semester hours of Education, in toto, 
are required. Three semester hours of this total must 
be earned in educational psychology and three in prin- 
ciples and methods of teaching. An option is allowed 
to the student to choose six hours of work among the 
other courses offered in Education in recognized stand- 
ard colleges and universities located in the State of 
Illinois. 
Indiana Teachers’ License Law of 1923.—Specific 
requirements in certain courses in different states vary 
as previously suggested. In Indiana, for example, one 
of the required courses, out of the total number out- 
lined, is observation and practice teaching. The 
General Assembly of the State of Indiana passed, in 
1923, an act empowering the State Board of Education 
to issue all teachers’ certificates. Local teachers’ ex- 
aminations were thereby dispensed with, and the 
licensing of teachers was based upon actual academic 
and professional preparation in some standardized 
higher teacher-training institution of the State. The 
act provided for the various types of licenses, namely,
-P-A-G-E-83
  
  PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 61 
superintendent’s, supervisor’s, elementary school prin- 
cipal’s, high school principal’s, elementary school 
teacher’s, high school teacher’s, junior high school 
teacher’s, and so forth. For example, a high school 
principal’s license of first grade, valid for five years, 
and renewable for life, is based upon graduation from 
a four-year higher institution of learning and comple- 
tion of one year of graduate work with specialization 
in high school administration and supervision. A high 
school teacher’s license of the same grade is issued to 
graduates of a four-year higher institution of learning 
who have specialized in two or more regular high 
school subjects, and in the teaching of them. 
The above legislation is an attempt to encourage 
academic and professional study, on the part of high 
school officers, in the standardized higher institutions 
of learning, in lieu of the usual examination system. 
This is an example of one of the pioneer efforts in 
state legislation pertaining to professional training of 
high school teachers. It is too early to be able to say 
whether the results will be superior to those realized by 
the previous practice of granting certificates on the 
basis of examinations. In theory, at any rate, it seems 
justifiable to encourage training for specialized work 
in the superintendency, the principalship and the su- 
pervisory and teaching positions of the high school. 
Requirements by Higher Institutions of Learning.— 
In addition to the above inter-state association stand- 
ards and requirements of state departments of instruc- 
tion, local state institutions and private higher insti- 
tutions of learning may have certain stipulations either 
in agreement with, or above or below those of the
-P-A-G-E-84
  62 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
inter-state associations and of the state departments 
of instruction. In 1923, for example, the requirements 
made by the state departments of Education and by the 
respective state universities were in agreement in 
Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Montana, 
North Dakota and South Dakota. The requirements 
made by the state universities were a little higher than 
those made by state departments of Education in 
Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and 
Oklahoma. 
The Need for Evaluating the Content of Courses 
in Education 
Necessity of the Study of Education by both Grad- 
uate and Undergraduate Students.—The opportunity 
for pursuing the study of Education must necessarily 
be open to both undergraduate and graduate students 
of higher institutions of learning, due to the practical 
exigencies of the situation. The requirements pointed 
out above apply to undergraduate students. In order 
to be eligible to teach in standardized secondary 
schools, college students are obliged to pursue the 
study of Education while completing other require- 
ments toward a bachelor’s degree. At the present 
time, there is no indication that the professional re- 
quirements, on the whole, will be reduced in amount. 
Because of these requirements, it is fair to the under- 
graduate student that he be given an opportunity to 
know about them not later than his sophomore year in 
college. These professional requirements, however, 
do not preclude the possibility of offering a limited
-P-A-G-E-85
PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 63 
number of courses in Education for their so-called 
value in general training or culture. 
The Pursuit of Education by Graduate Students.—As 
indicated previously, undergraduate courses in Educa- 
tion, treating its professional side, must be largely 
preliminary and introductory in nature, as well as of 
some value in the way of general training and culture. 
It is equally obvious that opportunity should be offered 
for graduates to do professional study on a higher 
level of maturity. Many graduates will have had some 
experience in teaching, as well as in administrative 
and supervisory work, in either elementary or sec- 
ondary schools. The work of the graduate student 
should consist of problems of original research, in- 
vestigation and experimentation relative to a wide 
range of pertinent studies. In the field of secondary 
education, as such, many problems are worthy of study. 
Among such are the costs, plans and adaptations of 
high school buildings; numerous specific problems 
under high school administration and supervision; 
high school technique of teaching; junior-senior high 
school curriculum formulation; statistical research; 
sutveys and so forth. Such investigations necessarily 
should extend over a period of a semester, a scholastic 
year or more. Evidences of the recent growth of 
graduate study in Education can be seen in the large 
array of courses now offered in the leading higher in- 
stitutions of the country, courses covering a wide 
range, pertaining to the kindergarten, the elementary 
school, the junior-senior high school and the junior 
college. These courses may be noted by an examina- 
tion of catalogs and bulletins.

  64. SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Avoidance of Mere Duplication of Content in Edu- 
cation Courses.—By actual count, it can be discovered 
that several scores or more of different types of 
courses in Education are now being offered by the 
higher institutions of learning. Administratively con- 
sidered, courses, in so far as it is possible, should be 
arranged with some consciousness of sequence or pro- 
gression. This is not easy to do, as is also true in 
other fields, such as social science or literature. Sev- 
eral types of introductory courses should also be 
offered, so as to give students an opportunity to make 
more than one approach to the study of Education. 
Students come to their courses in Education with all 
kinds of unequal preparation, but this is likewise true 
in the instance of most, if not all, of the academic sub- 
jects. And lastly, it would perhaps be more profitable 
to attempt to organize the content of materials to be 
taught in large units for presentation, rather than 
merely in terms of time-units, such as the term, semes- 
ter or year. A committee under the auspices of the 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools has been appointed to consider the matter of 
further standardization of courses offered in Edu- 
cation. 
The Establishment of Foundations for the Sup- 
port and Encouragement of Research in 
Secondary Education 
Influence of Bureaus of Education and Educational 
Foundations.—Many bulletins of large informational 
value, pertaining to the field of secondary education,
-P-A-G-E-87
  PROFESSIONAL VIEW OF EDUCATION 65 
have been distributed by the United States Bureau of 
Education, at Washington, D. C., during the last 
decade. These bulletins have represented a discussion 
of the general reorganization of the separate high 
school subjects. Large sums of money have been con- 
tributed under the auspices of certain organizations 
for carrying on investigations in mathematics, in Eng- 
lish and in the classical languages. Arrangements are 
now being perfected for carrying on further studies in 
the field of modern languages as taught in Amer- 
ica. The Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie 
Foundation have done great service in encouraging re- 
search in Education. It would be quite justifiable to 
endow institutions, and support them financially, so 
that an increased number of experts or specialists 
could be enabled to carry on extended investigations 
covering a series of years, in the field of secondary 
education. 
Bureaus of Research in Higher Institutions of Learn- 
ing.—Large business corporations are now making a 
practice of employing specialists for the purpose of 
outlining plans and policies for several years ahead. 
Salaries paid such individuals are frequently as much 
as $10,000 and above. But these organizations justify 
their procedure on the grounds that they will realize 
increased financial returns. In this respect, the school 
situation is somewhat different. Nevertheless, in the 
instance, for example, where communities have ap- 
parently reached their limit in the matter of taxation, 
a detailed analysis might show the value of redis- 
tributing funds in a more efficient way than had mre: 
viously been the custom.

66 SECONDARY. EDUCATION 
The bureaus of research recently created within our 
higher institutions of learning will, no doubt, assist 
greatly in encouraging the research spirit in modern 
problems of secondary education. Naturally, these 
bureaus of research have so far codperated most 
largely in studies made relative to elementary educa- 
tion. Controlled experimentation in different class- 
room procedures could be carried on increasingly in 
secondary schools, in codperation with bureaus of re- 
search located in higher institutions of learning. Re- 
formulation of junior-senior high school curricula is 
taking place in many communities at the present time. 
This offers an admirable opportunity for colleges of 
Education, bureaus of research in higher institutions 
of learning and bureaus of reference and research in 
secondary schools to codperate in the professional and 
scientific study of secondary education, with reference 
to a definite problem.

CHAPTER V 
SOME OF THE NEWER ASPECTS OF THE 
THHORY OF HIGH SCHOOL INSTRUCTION 
Introductory Statement.—The determination of sec- 
ondary school aims and the organization of subject 
matter so as to make possible the realization of these 
aims are important. Since, however, high school aims, 
subject matter and method are so interdependent upon 
one another, it is desirable to give some brief con- 
sideration to the instructional skill of teachers. The 
general technique of teaching has gradually become 
somewhat modified and supplemented in recent years. 
In addition to the general method of high school teach- 
ing, special methods or techniques of teaching of the 
respective high school subjects are now being de- 
veloped. Improved elementary school methods de- 
veloped first in the American public schools, and then, 
more tardily, emphasis upon method appeared in the 
secondary schools and colleges. Certain fundamen- 
tals, for example, such as the necessity of adapting 
instruction to the different capacities of pupils, apply 
to both the elementary and the secondary schools. It 
is not the purpose here to give an exhaustive discussion 
of either the general or special techniques of high 
school teaching, but only to enumerate certain aspects 
which have become prominent in secondary school 
practice.

  70 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Academic and Professional Training Supplemental 
or Complementary to One Another 
Academic and Professional Training Not Opposed 
to Each Other.—Very frequently, it has been assumed 
by writers and speakers in general that an academic 
knowledge of the high school subjects to be taught is 
more important than a knowledge of how to present 
such subject matter successfully to the high school 
pupil. Over-enthusiastic proponents of the value of a 
knowledge of the principles of high school teaching 
have sometimes made the opposite defense, namely, 
that mastery of high school subject matter itself is in- 
consequential as contrasted with the ability to teach 
facts or principles to some one else. The problem 
when stated in either of the above exaggerated forms 
affords no real basis for an educational argument. It 
is not a question of the absence of knowledge of sub- 
ject matter or its.opposition to method, but rather the 
reciprocal relation of the one to the other which is of 
real concern to the educator. 
It should always be assumed that teachers must 
possess just as thoroughgoing an academic knowledge 
of high school subjects to be taught as is possible. In 
general, the presumption is that teachers employed in 
standardized high schools do possess a bachelor’s de- 
gree, representing 120 semester hours, as the minimum 
requirement. In the instance of many college stu- 
dents, of course, certain professional studies as defined 
by the North Central Association, for example, are 
included within this 120 semester hours. Usually the 
minimum academic knowledge presumed to be neces-
-P-A-G-E-93
  
  NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 71 
sary in order to teach any high school subject is that 
equal to a major in that subject, as defined in terms of 
college work. The requirement for completing a so- 
called major will vary, of course, within different col- 
leges, from twenty to thirty hours. Furthermore, to 
know academically something of several other high 
school subjects closely allied to the chief subject one is 
to teach is recognized as being of large value, as it 
guarantees an easy command of a wealth of subject 
matter. 
The real issue, then, is not whether it is more im- 
portant for a high school instructor to possess an 
academic knowledge of the subject he teaches than to 
have a knowledge of how best to present it. The more 
pertinent problem for consideration is: How can 
knowledge presumably possessed by high school in- 
structors be presented most effectively to immature 
high school pupils? 
Technique of Teaching of Separate High School 
Subjects.—Misgivings have often been expressed by 
many individuals as to whether it is possible to de- 
velop a general method of teaching which will apply to 
all high school subjects. Extremists have declared 
that it is wholly impossible to teach any one how to 
teach. In reply it may be said that the general method 
of high school teaching as developed in relation to the 
underlying principles of educational psychology and 
experimentation in secondary education has increas- 
ingly justified itself through calling attention to the 
fact of individual differences in pupils, to the fact of 
different types of learning, such as motor, associative 
and reflective and to other equally important considera-  
-P-A-G-E-94
72 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tions. Certain common aspects of general method, or 
principles of teaching, apply to all of the high school 
subjects. 
Furthermore, certain aspects of the technique of 
teaching are peculiar to respective high school sub- 
jects. Therefore, it may rightly be assumed that a 
careful and detailed study of the technique of teaching 
each high school subject should be made. The teach- 
ing of English composition or literature may be im- 
proved through, an analysis of the various procedures 
possible in the best methods of classroom instruction. 
Certain experiments are now being tried out, for ex- 
ample, in the attempt to give much individual assist- 
ance and classroom guidance in the writing of English 
themes. What has come to be known in many in- 
stances as the ‘‘laboratorized’’ procedure is common 
to a number of ‘the high school subjects, such as Eng- 
lish and history. Organization of units of subject 
matter through the guided use of a considerable num- 
ber of textbooks and references constitutes an impor- 
tant phase of this so-called laboratory procedure in 
other school subjects than natural sciences. This 
phase will be referred to again later on in the chapter. 
As already indicated, certain aspects of the tech- 
nique of teaching are peculiar to the separate subjects. 
For example, in the case of the teaching of English 
composition, emphasis must, at times, necessarily be 
given both to form and to content of themes written. 
In the instance of literature, those aspects having to 
do with appreciation should naturally receive, propor- 
tionally, more emphasis. In some respects, the nature 
of the content of literature and that of social studies
-P-A-G-E-95
  NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 13 
overlaps. On the other hand, the development of what 
is known as historical perspective. or historic- 
mindedness, requires a different technique of teaching 
than that involved in the mechanics of English compo- 
sition. Ability on the part of pupils to understand and 
apply axioms in mathematics requires a different mode 
of mental procedure than does the study of literature. 
The technique of teaching used by teachers of math- 
ematics must correspond. The technique of teaching 
of high school science naturally involves the direction, 
by teachers, of experimentation in laboratories. The 
opportunities afforded to teachers to make concrete 
and objective the meaning and application of princi- 
ples are, perhaps, greater under well-controlled con- 
ditions in science teaching than in teaching any other 
of the academic high school subjects. 
Undoubtedly, teachers of the respective subjects will 
be better prepared to give efficient instruction after 
having consciously attempted to make an analysis of 
the varying techniques of presentation possible within 
the different subjects, as well as analyzing the different 
aspects of teaching any one high school subject. Ob- 
viously, each instructor should be trained in the tech- 
nique of teaching of his major high school subject and 
in those of one or two other related subjects, if pos- 
sible. The reason for the above statement is manifest 
since, on the whole, in the large number of small high 
schools that exist, most persons will be expected to 
teach more than one subject. The above contention 
is likewise pertinent in case of the larger cosmopolitan 
high schools, because of the desirability of an intel- 
ligent understanding and codperation between teachers  
-P-A-G-E-96
  74 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
in the different departments. It was indicated pre- 
viously that the North Central Association has recom- 
mended the pedagogy of separate high school subjects 
as one of the professional studies to be pursued by in- 
structors preparing to teach in secondary schools. 
In some of the higher institutions of learning, a 
limited number of courses in the special methods of the 
teaching of English, of mathematics, of foreign lan- 
guages, of sciences and so forth have been organized. 
On the whole, this phase of work has developed some- 
what too conservatively. Much more experimental 
work relative to these various types of technique of 
teaching of separate high school subjects should now 
be done, both in secondary schools and in colleges. 
Since the teaching and the learning processes are so 
closely interrelated, a double service could be rendered 
by experimental work done in this newer phase of the 
methods of high school teaching. 
Difficulties Involved in Establishing a Fundamental 
Theory of High School Teaching 
Doubtful Fads and Practices.—The use of illustra- 
tive devices is highly desirable in high school instruc- 
tion. Mere fads or patent medicine types of pro- 
cedure, however, have no place whatever in high school 
methodology. Published advertisements urging the 
reader to train his memory in twelve lessons, or to 
learn to play the piano or to speak a foreign language 
through training by correspondence represent types of 
procedure wholly unwarranted from the educator’s 
viewpoint. <A great array of advertisements of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
    NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 75 
type have appeared in magazines during the last ten 
years or more. 
Variable Factors To Be Recognized——So many va- 
riable factors enter into the teaching process that it is 
no simple task to attempt to establish a body of per- 
manent principles of teaching | applicable either to 
school subjects. In the first_place, “pupils | entering 
high school differ with earl o mental capacities ; ‘ 
to achievements in school subjects; and to previous in- 
terests, due either to formal training or to experience 
in general. In the second place, high school instruc- 
tors themselves differ from one another in their native 
ability to teach; in their previous training in different 
higher institutions of learning, which often results in 
a variety of viewpoints in the interpretation, for ex- 
ample, of literature or history; in temperament, and 
in personality in general; and in the amount of expe- 
rience gained from travel. (Im the third place, the 
physical conditions and equipment of high ‘schools will 
vary. In the fourth place, the environmental condi- 
tions—physical, social, and industrial—outside of the 
high school itself will vary in different communities 
within the same decade, as well as within successive 
decades in the same community. These difficulties, 
though numerous, are not insuperable. 
The above psychological and sociological factors, 
together with many others not here designated, should 
be recognized when one is attempting to formulate a 
body of guiding principles of high school teaching. 
Some of these factors are more difficult to control than 
others. In the instance of individual differences of   
       
-P-A-G-E-98
  
  76 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
pupils, considerable work has already been done to 
adapt principles of teaching through homogeneous 
grouping and through individualized instruction. 
This phase will be discussed in more detail at a point 
further on in the text. Much also has been done to 
provide suitable equipment for developing different 
techniques of teaching in the separate school subjects, 
as well as to adapt the nature of the subject matter 
taught to the varying capacities of individuals and to 
the needs and varying interests of pupil groups in dif- 
ferent communities. 
Importance of Illustrative Teaching and Use of Devices 
versus Formal Lecturing in High Schools 
General Nature and Value of Illustrative Teach- 
ing.—The use of illustrative teaching with concrete 
examples is psychologically well-founded, because of 
the effectiveness with which it reaches the pupil’s 
sensory-motor avenues of learning. This is true of 
students in the junior-senior high school, and even in 
the junior college, as well as of pupils in the elementary 
school. Sometimes it has been unjustifiably assumed 
that sensory-motor learning is limited to pupils below 
the secondary schools. 
Characterized as a whole, illustrative teaching is 
composed of a great variety of aspects, some of which 
may be thought of as informal or unstandardized de- 
vices, some as demonstration-lectures, some as labora- 
tory work in science and some as project work in 
various subjects. All of these phases suggested em-
-P-A-G-E-99
NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 7 
phasize the common element of self-activity rather 
than the passivity of the pupil. 
Nature and Value of Devices.—Devices in high 
school teaching may be thought of as any means or 
concrete procedures which tend to clarify the signif- 
icance and the application of principles. Principles 
of teaching are permanent in nature and universal in 
applicability. An illustration of such a principle may 
be found in the emphasis given to the adaptation of 
subject matter to the learner in terms of the capacities, 
interests and needs of pupils. Devices, in comparison 
with principles, represent temporary means for clar- 
ifying and applying principles, and should be modified 
in the light of varying situations of high school learn- 
ing and teaching. Concrete examples of devices in the 
different high school subjects are the playing of games 
in foreign language work; ‘‘choosing up’’ sides in 
mathematics, for competitions in drill or review; spell- 
downs in English and foreign languages; and asso- 
ciating events with dates or personages in history. It 
is almost impossible to overemphasize the necessity for 
continuing the copious use of illustrative devices all 
the way through the junior-senior high school, with 
some reduction, of course, in the relative amount in 
each successive year. 
Relative Value of the Demonstration-Lecture 
Method.—It is not the intention, here, to enter into a 
defense of any one method of presentation at the ex- 
pense of, or to the exclusion of, another. Whether, 
for example, the demonstration-lecture is more suitable 
than the experimental laboratory method in the teach-
-P-A-G-E-100
78 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ing of natural sciences in the high schools will, no 
doubt, depend upon certain conditions and situations. 
In the event that sections of classes in high school sci- 
ence chance to be quite large, certain disadvantages 
and limitations of the laboratory method are apparent, 
because of the difficulty of supplying each pupil with 
facilities for carrying on real experimentation. 
On the other hand, in large classes where the 
demonstration-lecture method is used solely, an ob- 
vious limitation exists due to the fact that pupils do 
not have opportunity ever to perform an original ex- 
periment. This represents a real psychological loss to 
the pupil. A successful experiment performed in high 
school science, no matter how simple it may be, serves 
as one means, among many others, of increasing the 
pupil’s confidence in his ability to perform a piece of 
very elementary research under comparatively well- 
controlled conditions. This, in addition to the clar- 
ification of his problem during the act of experiment- 
ing, represents a real mental asset for the pupil. This 
factor of cumulative self-confidence of the pupil in his 
ability to perform an experiment successfully is of 
considerable value in the teaching process. In many 
instances, it is the series of discouragements brought 
about by work half done, or poorly completed, that re- 
sults finally in the intellectual defeat or downfall of 
the pupil generally characterized as total failure. To 
avoid an undue number of these permanent defeats is 
a part of every teacher’s responsibility. 
Probably no successful teacher of science would 
presume to use any one method exclusively. Each 
method has its relative value under certain conditions: 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
    NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 79 
The demonstration-lecture method of teaching science 
may be warranted in some degree by the necessity of 
the instructor’s careful handling of expensive ap- 
paratus, the delicacy and difficulty of an experiment to 
be performed with a high degree of accuracy, the pos- 
sibility of a judicious saving of time in the attempt to 
cover a large range of topics under the different units 
of subject matter outlined, insufficiency of available 
equipment to provide each pupil with suitable ap- 
paratus in order that the whole group may work simul- 
taneously or by the more direct linking of the ex- 
periment and the result through the keeping of 
definiteness of aim consciously before the pupil. Some 
of the above justifications of the demonstration-lecture 
method, it will be noted, are characterized in terms of 
psychology and others in terms of administration. 
Relative Value of the Laboratory Method in Natural 
Sciences.—Students pursuing natural sciences in the 
high school frequently remark that they like the 
laboratory method because they are allowed to handle 
the apparatus, and so are enabled more easily to see 
first-hand results. It is commonplace, too, for stu- 
dents to complain that it is difficult when the group is 
large, thirty-five or more, to see the results in a 
demonstration-lecture exercise. The teacher usually 
is the most favored in this respect under such con- 
ditions. 
Of course, the mere existence of the laboratory 
method is no guarantee that one can secure perfectly 
accurate results. This is true especially in the event 
that the so-called ‘‘cook-book’’ recipe type of labora- 
tory work is done, without inducing the pupil to make  
-P-A-G-E-102
80 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
  out of it a self-problem-solving series of experiences. 
At least five reasons justify the use of the laboratory 
method of teaching of natural sciences in the high 
school: Students are enabled to get a first-hand ac- 
quaintance with the manipulation of apparatus as well 
as a direct observation of results; the student is able 
to repeat the experiment if necessary, or if he wishes 
to do so either because he is interested or because he 
wishes to obtain more accurate results; the responsi- 
bility for the outcome of the experiment is borne 
primarily by the pupil, and so there is less likelihood 
of mere entertainment; opportunity for exercising the 
law of self-activity of the student is given; and oppor- 
tunity for training in problem-solving and elementary 
reflective thinking is afforded. 
Two general outcomes ought to be realized as the 
result of the teaching of high school science irrespec- 
tive of any one dominant method used; first, the 
development of an investigative attitude of mind based 
upon the instinct of inquisitiveness or curiosity in- 
herited by the pupil; and second, a degree of mastery 
of the facts comparable to the level of maturity of the 
pupil in his adolescent stage of development. The re- 
search spirit here implied is necessarily far below the 
psychological level of that represented by the special- 
ist or expert authority in the field of natural science. 
Still it is possible to begin the development of the germ 
of what may become later a genuine spirit of research 
on the part of the pupil. 
Modified Laboratory Method of Teaching in Other 
High School Subjects——The tendency to ‘‘laborato- 
rize’’ the teaching of other high school subjects than 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 81 
natural sciences has previously been briefly noted. 
So far, the modified laboratory method of teaching has 
been developed most widely in conjunction with such 
subjects as history, English and, perhaps mathematics. 
One of the outstanding earmarks or characteristics of 
‘‘laboratorized’’ teaching is the attempt to convert the 
usual classroom recitations into profitable activity 
centers, either for groups or for individuals, or into 
full-class hour work periods. In some respects, this 
practice represents a reorganization of the so-called 
textbook method of instruction, except that in this 
newer procedure, the tendency is to use a much larger 
number of textbooks and references combined. Unit 
topics of subject matter rather than pages of book 
assignments are emphasized. The more logical or- 
ganization of subject matter, under the competent di- 
rection of the instructor, takes place after students 
have attempted, in their own way, to organize con- 
sciously the materials which have meaning for them. 
The above procedure is now being used in history work 
in a number of high schools. 
“Laboratorizing” Theme Writing—In classes in 
English composition, similarly, it is possible to ‘‘lab- 
oratorize’’ the writing of themes by having them 
written under supervision of the instructor during the 
hours provided for recitation or classroom work. In 
this instance, as many suitable books as possible hay- 
ing to do with theme writing are made available, 
through the conjoined efforts of the principal of the 
school, the English instructor and the students, either 
as groups or as individuals. Wherever this procedure 
is used in groups, the classes are comparatively small,
-P-A-G-E-104
  82 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
varying from ten to twenty or more. In general, con- 
siderable freedom prevails in the physical arrangement 
of the classroom and its equipment, and in regard to 
the completion of themes to be written or other units 
of subject matter to be studied. In some respects, the 
above procedure is similar to certain phases of indi- 
vidualized instruction, and to so-called project-teaching 
which has now come rather widely into vogue. One 
purpose of this laboratory method is to attempt to 
reduce routine and mechanical or perfunctory aspects 
to a minimum, and to substitute profitable activities 
which keep the class as a whole in action during the 
whole period under direction of the instructor; and 
furthermore, to develop a series of more natural and 
vigorous responses on the part of learners. Usually 
this procedure will require more effort and more 
definitely planned work on the part of the instructor 
than the formal method of instruction. 
Relative Place of the Formal Lecture Method.—In 
the light of the above discussion, and speaking of 
secondary education as a whole, formal lecturing in 
classroom instruction has, relatively, a very small 
place. The general psychological principle appropri- 
ately accompanying this statement is that the greater 
the number and variety of profitable reactions and 
responses the high school pupil is induced to make, the 
more successfully will teaching be done, and the more 
permanently will things be learned. This is to say 
that, all in all, formal lecturing should represent the 
exceptional procedure rather than the usual or common 
practice. In instances where materials are not at all 
easily available, either in books or in other sources; in 
\
-P-A-G-E-105
  NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 83 
instances where common difficulties appear in the 
mastery of certain materials for groups as a whole, 
and detailed explanation is needed; in instances where 
considerable effort has already been put forth by 
students, and a summary by the instructor as a con- 
nected unified whole would be of value to the group 
of pupils in common; in instances in literature or his- 
tory classes, for example, or other classes, where a few 
of the more talented or gifted instructors are able to 
present in an especially impressive way certain large 
general facts or principles; in instances where certain 
aspects of subject matter are so new that compara- 
tively little has yet appeared in print—in all of these— 
there is some justification for a limited amount of 
formal lecturing. So far, the lecture method has some 
virtue. But the purpose of the discussion in this sec- 
tion is to emphasize those methods of teaching, and 
the corresponding classroom activities, which put a 
premium upon the active getting of knowledge by 
pupils rather than upon formal giving of knowledge 
by instructors to passive recipients. 
The Use of Achievement Tests as Standardized 
Devices for Motivating the Teaching Process 
Achievement Tests as Standardized Devices.— 
Standardized achievement tests have been used widely 
for measuring the results, or products and outcomes, 
of teaching. This aspect will be referred to again ina 
later chapter. These tests may and do serve another 
purpose, however, than merely the measurement of 
achievement. In the previous discussion, a variety of 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  84 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
unstandardized devices have been referred to as 
means of motivating teaching. It is possible, however, 
to supplement these, for the purpose of motivating 
teaching, with the more standardized devices now com- 
monly known under the head of the educational meas- 
urements of separate school subjects. A number of 
the routine and information or factual aspects of high 
school subjects lend themselves to this mode of treat- 
ment. Directly, or at least indirectly, the written tests 
and examinations ordinarily given to pupils may 
gradually be modified. In some instances standard- 
ized tests might occasionally serve as substitutes for 
tests or examinations of the type commonly given. 
In the subject of high school English, tests in silent 
reading, language and composition are available. 
Suitable tests for this purpose exist also in algebra, 
geometry, foreign languages, history and some of the 
natural sciences. Modified examinations based upon 
completion tests, true and false tests, recognition tests 
and so forth afford an opportunity to use semi- 
standardized devices for motivating the teaching 
process. 
Contrast of the Use of Standardized Tests with the 
Project-Teaching.—In the use made in the past of 
standardized tests, the chief concern of the instructor 
was the uniformity of product in the more routine as- 
pects of school subjects. This aspect will receive 
further treatment in the chapter on measurement in 
» secondary education. On the other hand, the project- 
method of teaching now widely in vogue allows pupils 
an opportunity for the development of initiative and 
for freedom of expression of interests acquired previ-
-P-A-G-E-107
  oo. 
po ae € NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 85 
ously either through formal or informal education. 
Psychologically considered, the project-method of 
teaching involves the organization of the materials 
of instruction, chiefly on the basis of the interests of 
the pupil, under direction of the instructor. The ele- 
ment of drill is reduced to a minimum. Progress in 
the project is determined by the ability of the pupil 
to organize his material meaningfully. Precaution is 
necessary in the use of this method lest the continuity 
of organized subject matter be lost sight of, and the 
result be simply an encyclopedic mass, or hodgepodge 
of ragged details. Furthermore, care should be taken 
not to eliminate the element of drill wholly in this 
newer procedure. 
Some difference of opinion exists among authorities 
as to the technical definition or meaning of a project. 
There is agreement among authors, however, on the 
fact that the project-method must take into account 
the present interest and the previous training and 
preparation of the pupil. The project-method up to 
the present time has been most extensively used in 
the elementary school. The ‘‘case’’ method of instruc- 
tion is a modified form of the project-method, and has 
been used in some degree in both secondary schools 
and colleges. The project-method of teaching, when 
successfully used, does furnish an opportunity for real 
self-expression and initiative dn the part of the pupil. 
It tends also to break up the traditional and perfunc- 
tory organization of materials taught. When carried 
on in this spirit it is as applicable to the secondary 
school as it is to the elementary school. Whenever 
this method becomes a mere fetich or an end in itself,
-P-A-G-E-108
    86 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
much of its virtue will be lost. It should be thought 
of as one among a number of possible and desirable 
methods of procedure in teaching. 
The Organization and Function of Observation and 
Practice Schools 
Development of Observation and Practice Schools.— 
Observation of, and practice in, teaching has been in 
vogue since the days of Herbart (1776-1841), who, in 
1809, while teaching at Kénigsberg University, estab- 
lished a practice school in connection with the pedagog- 
ical seminary. Instructors preparing to teach in the 
secondary schools of Germany have, up to the present 
time, been required to spend several years in observa- 
tion and practice work during their professional train- 
ing in the university. The same thing is true in large 
measure in France. 
In the United States observation and practice teach- 
ing have been developed to a high degree by depart- 
ments and colleges of Education, the normal schools 
and other colleges and universities. In some instances, 
high schools in which this type of work is carried on 
have been named practice schools, and in other in- 
stances experimental or laboratory schools. 
Observation and Practice Teaching in Relation to 
Improved Methods of Instruction 
General Function of Practice Schools.—The general 
purpose or function of observation and practice teach- 
ing is to afford an opportunity to inexperienced
-P-A-G-E-109
NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 87 
teachers to apply to actual concrete classroom situa- 
tions whatever theory or principles of teaching they 
have acquired. From twenty to forty percent of the 
high school teachers leave the profession each year. 
These vacancies must be filled by inexperienced col- 
lege students. The interneship created by medical 
schools is regarded as giving most valuable prepara- 
tion for the work of the physician. In some respects, 
the observation and practice work, when well organ- 
ized and administered, is analogous to the interneship 
of the student’s experience in hospitals. It is the real 
test of a student’s ability to put into practice funda- 
mental theory. 
Critics have sometimes suggested that this ex- 
perience is of no value to prospective teachers. Such 
a viewpoint is, of course, extreme. The use of the 
word ‘‘practice’’ has unfortunately prejudiced many 
persons against these schools. Patrons and other lay- 
members commonly take the above attitude as the basis 
of their objections. One indirect reasonable reply 
may be made to such objectors, namely, that probably 
less harm is done to pupils in well-supervised, so-called 
practice schools than is usually done under wholly 
unsupervised conditions by scores of poorly trained 
teachers in the ordinary high school. 
Supervision of Observation and Practice Teaching. 
—It is possible for observation and practice teaching 
to be carried on in a very perfunctory and mechanical 
manner by college students unless it is well supervised. 
The exact plan of supervision will necessarily vary 
according to different situations. Instructors in the 
various departments of the liberal arts and sciences
-P-A-G-E-110
    88 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
college often are used as the chief advisers in the 
corresponding departments of the high school. In 
other instances, teachers of successful experience 
within the high schools themselves are used as super- 
visors of the college-student teachers. In this way 
it is possible to provide lesson plans carefully worked 
out for the various units of subject matter to be taught. 
In any event, codperation between supervisors and 
student-teachers is essential to the success of any plan 
adopted. Conferences of many kinds should be pro- 
vided for. Artificial and make-believe teaching can 
thus be reduced to the minimum, if not wholly elimi- 
nated. 
Difficulties To Be Recognized in Observation Work. 
—Observation work, in some respects, is more difficult 
to organize and control than practice teaching. This 
is especially true when several hundred or more college 
students are expected to visit high school classes dur- 
ing each semester. The large number of students re- 
quired to make observations during each semester, the 
limited number of visitations possible to each student, 
the difficulty in knowing what to look for, the impossi- 
bility of seeing more than one or two aspects of class- 
room method during each visitation made—these 
represent factors that need to be considered. In cer- 
tain institutions, observation and practice teaching are 
carried on conjointly, in others separately. The gen- 
eral practice, which seems the more desirable, is to 
organize it, if possible, so as to do the observation and 
practice teaching conjointly. This must in the end 
be determined, however, by local situations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 89 
College and University High Schools as Laboratories 
and Experiment Stations.—Observation and practice 
teaching work has been used largely, in the past, as a 
substitute for experience in teaching on the part of 
college graduates. A limited number of state depart- 
ments of public instruction have made this work com- 
pulsory on those desiring to secure state certificates. 
Indiana, for example, has such legislation. Higher 
institutions of learning located in states having such 
legislation have tended also to make the same require- 
ment. It is reasonable to believe that university high 
schools might also perform other functions than that 
of training prospective teachers in the methods of 
teaching already in use. 
Usually experimental and laboratory high schools 
connected with the higher institutions of learning have 
a smaller number of pupils enrolled than do public 
high schools. This represents a situation somewhat 
more subject to control for purposes of experimenta- 
tion in different methods of classroom procedure than 
is ordinarily possible in public high schools. There- 
fore, a study of a variety of techniques of teaching of 
different high school subjects should commend itself to 
the principals and teaching staff of all university high 
schools. Such studies and experimental investigations 
should be continued over a consecutive period of years, 
from two to four or more, depending somewhat upon 
the nature of the undertaking. The results of such 
experimentation need not necessarily lead to radical 
departures from previous schoolroom practices. 
Only such findings as seem to be workable with a high
-P-A-G-E-112
  90 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
degree of improvement should be introduced, and the 
introduction should be gradual, so as to safeguard 
against the temptation to try out merely spectacular 
fads. To a limited extent, high schools organized in 
connection with the higher institutions of learning 
throughout the United States have begun to do more 
and more of the experimental type of work suggested 
above. 
Summary of Newer Tendencies in the Technique 
of High School Teaching 
Supplementation of General Method by Special 
Methods.—The principle of adaptation in high school 
teaching has been recognized as important for many 
years. But this principle has come to have increased 
significance in the light of our knowledge of the indi- 
vidual differences of pupils as interpreted in terms of 
modern educational psychology. Furthermore, it is 
now recognized that each group of high school subjects 
requires a technique of presentation of subject matter 
peculiar to itself. It is, therefore, necessary for each 
high school instructor, in addition to his knowledge of 
general high school method based upon sound psy- 
chology of adolescence, to have a thorough knowledge 
of the techniques of instruction best adapted to the 
high school subjects which he attempts to teach. 
Methods of Teaching Emphasizing Reactionistic ver- 
sus Impressionistic Learning—The previous dis- 
cussion of the newer methods of instruction is based 
upon a modern conception of mental activity rather 
than mere passivity of the learner. Such methods are
-P-A-G-E-113
  NEWER ASPECTS OF INSTRUCTION 91 
assumed to be based primarily upon a reactionistic 
versus an impressionistic psychology. Figuratively 
speaking, the pupil’s brain is not merely like wax 
or white paper on which the instructor, with ideas, 
makes impressions or imprints, nor is his brain a cav- 
ity into which knowledge is formally ‘‘poured.’’ Re- 
cent adolescent psychology assumes that the high 
school pupil possesses a psycho-physical organism in 
which mind, body and brain are closely related. Dif- 
.ferent types of stimuli produce different types of re- 
sponses. In the light of recent psychology, therefore, 
those methods of instruction used by the instructor to 
present facts or ideas in such a way as to cause 
significant and profitable pupil-responses, or pupil- 
reactions, are most worthy of consideration. 
In so far as the textbook, formal lecture or any 
other method of instruction used fails to produce a 
variety of wholesome mental reactions on the part of 
the high school pupil, just in this proportion is it an 
unwarrantable procedure. On the other hand, any 
method or device used in the newer techniques of 
teaching which guarantees a large number of pupil- 
responses having real meaning and value is justifiable 
and desirable. 
Methods Based upon Experimental Practice—Fun- 
damental theory in teaching is always of large value as 
a guide to practice. This is as true of high school 
teaching as of any other phase of school work. 
New theory in high school teaching ought always 
to be tested if possible. A very limited amount 
of such testing can be done in the public high 
schools of the United States under trained leader-
-P-A-G-E-114
  92 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ship. The high schools established in connection with 
the higher institutions of learning throughout the 
country are best prepared to do this experimental 
work in the technique of teaching and in other 
problems of the secondary school. For purposes of 
analysis, it is possible to separate the technique of 
high school teaching from the learning process of high 
school pupils, though of course, in actual schoolroom 
practice, they do go on together. A brief discussion 
of some of the factors in the learning process of the 
high school pupil follows in the next chapter, since it 
is necessary to know something of the pupil in order 
to have a complete institutional consciousness of the 
high school as a whole.

CHAPTER VI 
THE NATURE AND ANALYSIS OF THE 
LEARNING PROCESS OF HIGH SCHOGL 
PUPILS 
Introductory Statement.—The two previous chap- 
ters have emphasized the professional training of the 
teaching corps in secondary schools and the newer 
technique of instruction. In any discussion of the 
fundamentals of secondary education, the high school 
pupil must also be taken into account. It is important 
to know, in a general way, the psychological nature of 
the adolescent, to know something of the interests and 
aptitudes with which he comes into the secondary 
school and to know in considerable detail the exact 
nature of his mental reactions involved in the learn- 
ing process. The present chapter is confined chiefly 
to this last aspect. The discussion of other aspects of 
adolescent characteristics will appear,\at times, in fol- 
lowing chapters, though little space will be given to 
a mere description of the adolescent traits on their own 
account. 
For present purposes it is more relevant to attempt 
to characterize reactions made by pupils to curricular 
and other stimuli than to furnish a mere general de- 
scription of adolescent characteristics. The analysis 
of the nature of the learning process in handwriting,

games, typing and separate high school subjects fur- 
nishes certain analogies that are suggestive to high 
school instructors. These will appear in later sections 
of this chapter. 
Complexity and Analogy of Animal and Human 
Learning 
The Learning Process Functionally Defined.—The 
learning process as used in the following discussion 
includes all motor and mental activities that are ex- 
pended by the pupil in the successful acquisition of 
new skills or habits and of new ideas or ideals. Any- 
thing will be regarded as learned when it can be used 
with a reasonable degree of expertness or proficiency 
either in some practical situation or in the acquisition 
of further knowledge. 
Comparison of Animal and Human Learning.— 
Animal learning has been analyzed in considerable 
detail by experimental psychologists, chiefly in terms 
of behavior. Human learning, especially in young 
children, has been described at length by child psy- 
chologists. The analysis of the factors involved in the 
learning processes of high school pupils, in terms of 
high school subjects, can and should be carried ahead 
much further than has yet been done. 
Self-Activity Important in the Learning Process.— 
A comparison may be made of certain factors involved 
in the learning of animals and of young children with 
those of adolescents and of adults. Two such factors 
are self-activity and the capacity of an organism to 
profit from experience. The tendency of all organ-
-P-A-G-E-119
    ANALYSIS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS 97 
isms, for example, is to be incessantly active. Self- 
activity of the organism, whether it be of animal or 
human kind, is a very important characteristic of the 
learning process. The ability of the individual or- 
ganism to profit through self-activity is essential in 
order that learning may take place. Not all types of 
animal organisms profit equally from experience. 
The number of reactions possible in learning is much 
greater in the case of vertebrate life than in the case 
of invertebrate, due in part to the structure of the 
organism and in part to the ability to profit by ex- 
perience through successive reactions made. Like- 
wise, there are many gradations represented even 
among vertebrate animals, including human beings, in 
the ability to profit by experience through sensory- 
motor and higher thought processes. 
Man’s Superior Ability To Profit from Experience. 
—One of the chief differences, psychologically speak- 
ing, between man and the other vertebrates is this 
superior ability to learn and profit from experience. 
The number of reactions which the human being can 
make, especially in terms of the higher thought proc- 
esses, is almost incalculable. In case of sensory ex- 
perience, it is possible for animals to develop the 
function of some one sense organ to a very high degree. 
But the human being has the advantage of being able 
to learn through the use of a variety of sensory ave- 
nues. The acquisition of a variety of motor and tac- 
tual experiences through the possession of a hand alone, 
affords a great educational advantage to the pupil, 
in his learning, over the structurally limited lower 
organisms. There is practically no limit to the number
-P-A-G-E-120
  98 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of educative reactions, motor and mental, which it is 
possible for the high school pupil to make, when favor- 
able conditions are provided. 
Trial and Error a Generic Pattern Method of 
Learning 
Application to High School Learning.—All learning 
begins primarily through trial motor activity, or 
through trial ideas. Perhaps, with reference to hu- 
man beings, it is more accurate to say that one or the 
other of these aspects simply predominates. In such 
skills in high school work as are involved in typing, 
mechanical drawing, certain aspects of manual train- 
‘ing, sewing, the routine aspects of painting and vocal 
and instrumental music, trial and error in terms of 
motor activity is undoubtedly very prominent. In the 
practice of acquiring the correct pronunciation and 
accent in the beginning of the study of foreign lan- 
guages, the kinesthetic feeling, in the muscular reac- 
tions of the lips, tongue, palate and throat, is involved. 
The study of foreign vocabularies involves, also, asso- 
ciative processes of a somewhat higher order, to which 
reference will later be made. In the instance of the 
study of high school mathematics or science, trial and 
success learning manifests itself predominantly in the 
forming of ideas with varying degrees of accuracy by 
different pupils, by the same pupils at different times 
and by the same pupil at different stages of his prog- 
ress. Trial ideas, as well as trial motor activities, 
are manifested in many ways in the reactions made by 
high school pupils to various curricular materials. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
ne 
ANALYSIS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS 99 
The objective evidence of trial and success activity 
can be seen in the graphic representation of the un- 
even, undulated curves of learning of the often quoted 
experiments in typewriting, telegraphy and foreign 
language, as reported by Bryan and Harter. In sub- 
stance, a basal assumption can be made to the effect 
that the trial and error method is the pattern used by 
all organisms at some time, and to some degree, i in all 
learning processes. 
The psychological postulate stated above applies not 
only to animals and young children, but to high school 
pupils and to adults as well. That is to say, wherever 
anything is learned for the first time, the initial steps 
are characterized usually, if not always, by hit and 
miss efforts, excess movements and trial ideas. The 
proportionate number of these random exertions re- 
quired for mastery will depend, in part, upon the diffi- 
culty of the thing to be learned; in part, upon the 
previous training and experience of the individual; 
and in part, upon both of these, as well as upon other 
possible factors. 
: Situation Technically Defined—Mastery will de- 
_ pend also upon the nature of the situation to be con- 
| fronted by the learner. Situation, in the sense used 
|   
here, consists of a combination of all the factors that 
_ confront a pupil when he attempts to learn anything 
_ whatsoever. In terms of the present discussion, high 
_ school subjects, academic and practical, make up the 
_ significant situations to be confronted by the pupil. 
Sometimes, it is assumed that the learning of academic 
subjects is all that is really consequential. In this 
instance, it is assumed that the analysis of the learn- 
LIBRARY

MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
    100 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ing process is about equally important in each of these 
two large groups of subjects above named. It is un- 
satisfactory to assume that the learning process in- 
volved in the mastery of academic high school subjects 
is difficult and important, and, contrariwise, that the 
process as regards practical high school subjects is 
always easy and inconsequential. 
The study of practical arts, when pursued far 
enough by an individual, may also represent diffi- 
cult and important work. For certain pupils the 
initial work done in practical arts may be as diffi- 
cult for them as is the pursuit of academic sub- 
jects for other pupils. ‘What is here thought of as the 
total learning situation confronted by pupils may be 
composed of other aspects than the content of academic 
and practical arts subjects; it may include athletic, 
social and artistic aspects, or others. These and other 
phases are all a part of the composite total learning 
situation to be confronted by the high school pupil, 
and cannot be wholly ignored. 
Reduction of Aimless Efforts through Instructor’s 
Assistance.—As already intimated, the discussion of 
the trial and success method of learning has been con- 
fined usually to the level of animals and of children 
in the elementary school or below. It is apparent that 
this method of learning is found in many instances 
and continuously, too, on the level of pupil-experience 
in the secondary school. This may seem, on first 
thought, to be true only of certain high school subjects. 
The degree in which it is manifested may vary in case 
of the pursuit of different high school subjects. 
‘“‘Fumbling around’’ represents the least profitable
-P-A-G-E-123
  ANALYSIS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS 101 
phase of the trial and error experience. But it is 
probable that what has been thought of as ‘‘fumbling 
around’’ by the pupil takes place on the part of some 
individuals in each subject studied, and in some in- 
stances, in different aspects of the same school subject 
studied. Too long continued ‘‘fumbling’”’ efforts and 
hazy ideas of pupils may represent delayed trial and 
error attempts, sometimes due to lack of proper di- 
rection and encouragement of the pupil at the right 
moment. It is difficult to say whether the trial and 
error experience is absolutely inevitable. It is certain, 
however, that high school instructors should not allow 
this condition to continue indefinitely without any at- 
tempt to reduce the number of useless efforts. Elim- 
ination of useless, and selection of useful, reactions 
must be made, at times, by the learner in order to make 
progress. The pupil should be helped by the instructor 
to make the most profitable mental reactions possible 
in the study of difficult subject matter in any subject 
pursued. 
Application of the Curve of Learning to the High 
School 
Rapid Learning of High School Pupils.—Several 
characteristics of the learning curve are always ap- 
parent, whether considered in terms of habits and 
skills acquired or knowledge gained in the pursuit of 
high school subjects. One of these characteristics is 
represented by the rapid rise that occurs during the 
first few days or weeks in the pupil’s attempt to learn 
to do any new performance, or in his effort to attain to  
-P-A-G-E-124
  102 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
some new intellectual accomplishment. Attempting to 
learn to speak or to read a foreign language, is an 
example of this last mentioned aspect. The initial 
rapid upshoot in the learning curve tends to appear in 
ease of all subjects pursued for the first time. It may 
be accounted for, in part, by the newness or charm of 
what is being attempted, and, in part again, by the 
simplicity of the initial content to be mastered. This 
characteristic applies to secondary as well as to ele- 
mentary school learning. 
Delayed Learning of High School Pupils.—Another 
prominent characteristic of the learning curve is repre- 
sented by that part of it which indicates little if any 
outward progress. This has been designated as the 
plateau of learning by psychologists. Various ex- 
planations have been offered to account for these ap- 
parent delays indicated in the learning curve. It is 
difficult to say whether these plateaus are inevitable. 
At any rate, they occur frequently enough to demand 
consideration not only in animal learning and in the 
experience of elementary school pupils, but also in the 
learning processes of secondary school pupils. It is 
natural to make the pedagogical implication at this 
point, that it is important for teachers in every grade 
of work, including the high school, to realize the nature 
of, and the probability of, the oceurrence of delayed 
learning. Such delays are due to a great variety of 
reasons in the midst of actual high school situations. 
These intervals of delayed learning should be carefully 
observed and diagnosed by high school instructors. 
Objective Analyses of Difficulties——The activities 
involved in this phase of the learning process are
-P-A-G-E-125
  ANALYSIS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS 103 
intimately related, at many points, to the problems in 
the technique of teaching. The teaching and the 
learning processes are reciprocally related in this re- 
spect as well as in many others. It is impossible 
to overemphasize the necessity of making objective 
analyses of the difficulties involved in the learning 
processes of pupils, wherever and whenever it is prac- 
ticable to do so, for the purpose of taking remedial 
measures. The complexity of the learning process in 
the instance of elementary school pupils is not fully 
realized by all teachers. Perhaps this is even more 
true with respect to mental activities pertaining to 
high school pupils. The usual general assumption that 
high school pupils are mature enough to get along 
wholly alone is fallacious. Trial and error, in some 
degree, occurs in all of the types of learning indicated 
below. 
Application of Three Types of Learning to the High 
School 
Three Types of Learning—Three types of activity 
are involved in the learning process: First, that type 
having to do predominantly with motor skills; second, 
with associative processes; and third, with reflective 
thinking. The trial and success method is represented 
in all of these types. It is sometimes assumed that the 
motor-skill aspect is limited to the elementary school 
pupil exclusively, and that the reflective aspect does 
not manifest itself at all until the pupil later enters 
secondary school work. Sensory-motor learning does 
predominate in the elementary school, but it also con-
-P-A-G-E-126
104 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tinues, in a somewhat different manner, throughout 
the secondary school. Furthermore, reflective think- 
ing on the concrete, problem-solving level may begin 
in the elementary school and continue throughout the 
secondary school. 
Concomitant Theory of Mental Development.—Re- 
cent educational psycholcgy justifies the assumption 
that all of the different psycho-physical processes of 
the higher levels, as well as sensory-motor processes, 
begin in crude form to function in the lives of pupils 
concomitantly while they are in attendance in the ele- 
mentary school. This involves a fundamental psy- 
chological tenet, suggested elsewhere in connection 
with the discussion of the unity of the learning proc- 
ess, namely, that all mental processes of pupils begin 
to operate at the same time. Some mental aspects at 
certain stages and in certain situations manifest them- 
selves more prominently than others. The concomi- 
tant theory of mental development involves the presence 
of all the mental traits, sensory-perception, imagina- 
tion and reasoning, at all stages of development, but in 
varying proportions. 
Unity of the Learning Process.—A pedagogical ap- 
plication of the foregoing statement is that it is im- 
portant for all instructors in both elementary and 
secondary schools to recognize that the human organ- 
ism is always psycho-physical, and that the human 
mind, at all stages and in all cyeles-of the educative 
process, functions as a unit. The recognition of this 
psychological postulate may be of great value to in- 
dividual teachers in the realization of the principle of 
unity or continuity referred to in a later chapter. Ac-
-P-A-G-E-127
ANALYSIS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS 105 
cording to this tenet, there is no place for the one-time 
emphasis upon the division of the mind into separate, 
water-tight compartments, that is, there is no signifi- 
cant place for the so-called earlier type of faculty 
psychology. 
Examples Illustrative of the Complexity of the 
Learning Process of High School Pupils 
Handwriting a Plexus of a Series of Codrdinated 
Acts.—A fallacy frequently found in the thinking of 
many individuals is the assumption that most of the 
learning of the various kinds of skills is made up of 
very simple processes. The untutored person believes 
that certain automatic habits such as walking, writing, 
throwing or hitting a ball, swimming and typing repre- 
sent very simple processes. Upon close analysis, it 
will be found, however, that such accomplishments 
represent a hierarchy of codrdinated acts. Certain 
authorities, such as Professor Freeman and ©. T. 
Gray, have given objective evidence of this through 
studies made of handwriting. Certain muscular co- 
ordinations have been accurately photographed so that 
it has become possible to obtain a definite knowledge 
of the finger, hand, wrist and arm movements involved 
in handwriting. It is possible, therefore, for teachers 
to realize that handwriting represents a plexus of 
habits. With such knowledge in mind, it is possible 
for them to give greater assistance to young pupils 
who are attempting to learn to write for the first time. 
This illustration serves the purpose of calling atten- 
tion to a second aspect of the above fallacy, namely,
-P-A-G-E-128
    106 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the assumption that most learning relative to the 
higher thought processes is very simple in nature. 
The need for analysis is even more important here. 
The above discussion of handwriting may easily serve 
as an analogy to what happens in case of pupils who at- 
tempt to master the more abstract materials taught in 
highschool. The higher the thought processes involved, 
the more difficult it is to analyze clearly these different 
subjective factors. 
The Complexity of the Learning of Individual 
Games in High School.—Analogous to some of the 
processes of learning found in handwriting are also 
those involved in learning to play games. The psy- 
chology of games furnishes a wealth of suggestive 
illustrations to high school instructors of other school 
subjects, especially with reference to those aspects of 
the experience of pupils involving routine skills. Any 
kind of game might be used to illustrate the complexity 
of learning. As a representative example, the now 
widely played game of golf is used to exemplify the 
complexity of factors involved in what seems to many 
onlookers to be the mere chasing of a ball over a 
spacious field. To the inexperienced onlooker, driving 
the ball successfully from the tee, represents a very 
simple process. (Parenthetically, it may be said, that 
the easiest way to convince the onlooker of his errone- 
ous judgment is to give him a wooden driver and let 
him have the strange and annoying sensation of miss- 
ing the ball completely.) 
What are some of the objective factors involved in 
making a successful drive? The position in which one 
places his feet; their nearness together and the angle
-P-A-G-E-129
  ANALYSIS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS 107 
between them; pivoting on the feet, and the firmness 
of the feet; the bending of one knee, and the bracing 
with the other at the correct time when making the 
stroke; non-movement of the head; keeping the eye on 
the ball; holding the stick properly; the position of one 
hand with reference to the other; the adjustment of 
the palm of the hand and the fingers on the grip of the 
club; bending, turning and balancing the body prop- 
erly; standing the proper distance from the ball; fol- 
lowing the ball through at the proper angle, without 
chopping; getting the kinesthetic feeling produced by 
the head of the stick in hitting the ball; keeping the 
proper position of the left arm when the club is swung 
back; timing the stroke; using the right arm properly 
in swinging the club forward to hit the ball; all these 
randomly mentioned factors, and others not here sug- 
gested, represent the codrdination of the muscles of 
the head and neck, eyes, arms, hands, wrists, fingers, 
trunk of the body and feet, which is necessary in order 
to make one successful drive from the tee. 
The condition of the tee, rough or smooth; the nature 
of the material used for teeing up; the condition of the 
stick used for driving off; and the physical condition 
and mental attitude of the player are other factors 
influential in helping or hindering the skillful perform- 
ance of the act of driving from the tee. 
It is clear upon making even such a cursory analysis 
as the above that in the playing of a game of golf of 
nine or eighteen holes a hierarchy of automatic acts 
or habits is represented. Hitting the ball on the fair- 
way, approaching the green and putting the ball into 
the cup require other strokes, adjustments and judg-  
-P-A-G-E-130
    108 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ments, which may be analyzed similarly to those made 
in the drive, outlined above. Many uncontrollable 
factors enter in, too, such as: Wet or dry ground; 
long or short grass in the fairway, and on the greens; 
windy, calm or cloudy days; obstructing sunshine in 
mornings, afternoons or evenings; natural and arti- 
ficial physical hazards; mental hazards; hurried or 
deliberate judgments in use of sticks, and so on almost 
indefinitely. 
The analogy here used between learning to play golf 
and learning as involved in the skills in high school 
work will have served its purpose if it has made 
clear that any skill may be broken up and analyzed so 
as to show that even a relatively simple learning proc- 
ess represents a plexus of mental and motor activities, 
rather than a single-line, straightforward reaction. 
As on the golf course, so in and about the classroom 
there are many variable factors, some of them almost 
uncontrollable. The ability of instructors to help 
pupils to discover these and to control them, in a meas- 
ure, is one way among many others in which it is 
possible to increase the efficiency of high school 
instruction. 
Some Factors Involved in Learning To Typewrite 
in High School.—The performances involved in learn- 
ing to use a typewriting machine may be analyzed also 
with considerable definiteness and accuracy. Suppose 
a high school pupil has set for himself a speed test of 
typewriting a page or two either of dictated or copy 
material. What are some of the factors involved in 
the ability to typewrite such materials without error? 
As in a single successful golf drive, so here, the factors
-P-A-G-E-131
ANALYSIS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS 109 
are numerous. Some of these, again, are subjective 
in nature. Many of them, however, are objective 
enough to be easily described and analyzed. The posi- 
tion of the hand, relative to the keyboard; the move- 
ments of the fingers in making the different symbols, 
letters, figures, punctuation marks and other signs; 
the use of the carriage shift, lock shift, back spacer, 
tabular key and so forth—these all represent the neces- 
sity of a combination of acts that must be codrdinated 
if the pupil is to type with any degree of efficiency. 
Subjective factors, such as the learner’s attitude 
toward typing, fatigue, lack of interest and other men- 
tal factors are also involved. 
Some Factors Involved in Learning Foreign Lan- 
guages in High School.—An analysis can be made of 
the learning processes in any of the more abstract high 
school subjects. Foreign language is here used as 
illustrative, because it is rather easy to select certain 
representative aspects which are involved in all lan- 
guage learning of high school pupils. Pupils come to 
the first session of a language class with all varieties 
of backgrounds and formal preparations. This is, 
of course, true of the English language as well as of 
foreign languages. The associative type of learning 
is prominent in the study of foreign languages. On 
the whole, this represents a higher type of learning 
process than the sensory-motor type. It is possible to 
select at random a number of the aspects involved 
in any foreign learning situation. These will vary 
somewhat, depending upon whether the language is 
ancient or modern. Still there are many common as- 
pects in the learning of these two kinds of languages.  
-P-A-G-E-132
    110 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Wholly new words with their meanings; words used in 
varying contexts and settings; idiomatic expressions; 
separable and inseparable verbs in certain languages; 
direct and indirect discourse in certain languages; 
translation from one language to another; reading at 
sight and so forth—these represent some of the phases 
necessary to be considered when pupils attempt to 
learn foreign languages. 
It will be noted that no attempt in this brief listing 
of the different phases has been made to arrange them 
in the order of their psychological difficulty in terms 
of mastery on the part of the pupil. For example, it 
is evident that in studying Latin the acquisition of 
vocabulary is less complicated than is the translation 
of indirect discourse. The above description, brief as 
it is, is some justification for calling attention of in- 
structors to the fact that for the novice the first lesson 
in foreign language may easily appear to be little more 
than an intellectual maze in which the pupil is at a loss 
to know which way to move during the first few days, 
and sometimes even weeks. To the competent in- 
structor the above-named factors, and others not 
enumerated, will represent a series of processes neces- 
sary to be understood in order that the pupil may 
learn not only more easily, but more successfully as 
well. Instructors, therefore, should be expected to be 
able to study the mental processes used by high school 
pupils in language learning, as well as to have a com- 
mand of the subject matter to be taught. 
For example, it is quite probable that not all high 
school pupils who acquire command of sufficiently 
large vocabularies during the first year of foreign lan-
-P-A-G-E-133
  ANALYSIS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS ay 
guage study to read with ease do so in exactly the 
same manner. One pupil may be using one procedure, 
and another pupil, another procedure, and these, in 
some instances, may be almost equally good or justi- 
fiable. To discover just how pupils do acquire a work- 
ing body of the words found in the printed vocabulary 
lists of first year foreign language texts would be a 
noteworthy study if made by some competent instruc- 
tor, during a period of a year or more. Furthermore, 
an extensive and intensive study of the differences in 
attitudes and accomplishments of pupils in the study 
of words as arranged in columns, or as learned in 
short, easy readings in the midst of certain contexts, 
would be profitable. It might possibly be found that 
there is considerable loss in the mere memorization of 
words and vocabularies as arranged in column form in 
textbooks. 
Some Factors Involved in Learning in High School 
Mathematics and Science.—In case of such abstract 
subjects as mathematics and science, the associative 
and reflective types of learning predominate. In the 
instances of arithmetic, elementary algebra, elemen- 
tary geometry and elementary science, these types of 
learning appear in simpler form, accompanied by a 
minimum use of the motor type of learning. The use 
of measurements in arithmetic, the construction of fig- 
ures in geometry and of the manipulation of apparatus 
in sciences are examples of the motor type of learning. 
Evidences of the need of the associative type of learn- 
ing are to be found in the use of axioms, equations, 
formule and so forth. Contrary to common belief, 
memorization of correct or appropriate associations 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  112 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
is important in the learning of both mathematics and 
science. Furthermore, the ability to see relations 
which represents the heart of reflective learning is 
valuable all the way through high school mathematics 
and science, beginning with those relations that are 
very elementary and progressing gradually to those 
that are more and more complex. In both science and 
mathematics, the securing of accurate results is desir- 
able, though this procedure, too, must be thought of 
in the learning process of high school pupils as de- 
veloping gradually from the ability to secure only ap- 
proximately accurate results up to the ability to se- 
cure those which are without error. 
These few simple illustrative studies have been sug- 
gested because they are practicable in schools of al- 
most any size. It is well known that it is impossible 
for pupils ever to hope to make any very rapid prog- 
ress during the second and third years of foreign 
language study unless there is a proper mastery of a 
sufficiently large working vocabulary during the first 
year. The nature and the number of words necessary 
- to be known by the student at the end of the first year’s 
study will, of course, depend very much on the nature 
of the work to be offered in the second and third years 
of work. Certain educational tests have been devised 
to enable the instructor to determine early in the 
semester’s work the students’ achievements as to their 
working vocabulary, as well as to note the gain made 
by them during their successive weeks of study. From 
even such a limited discussion as the above, it is ob- 
vious that foreign language learning, as well as the 
learning involved in other high school subjects, is a
-P-A-G-E-135
  ANALYSIS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS 113 
very complex process. It is essential, therefore, that 
instructors do everything possible in the way of 
analytically breaking up these complex processes so 
as to assist pupils in the fullest mastery of the studies 
pursued. 
Analyses of Factors in Practical Arts Subjects.— 
Objective analyses can be made of the learning proc- 
esses involved in the study of practical arts in 
secondary schools to a larger degree than has yet been 
done. Because of the nature of certain skills used 
in the fundamentals of wood-turning, pattern-making 
and forging, considering the work of the boys, it is 
somewhat easier to make detailed analyses of these 
studies than of the academic high school subjects. 
The suggestions which have been made relative to the 
practical arts for the boys are analogously applicable 
to the practical arts work done by the girls in second- 
ary schools. 
The Importance of the Reflective Type of Learning. 
—Previously it was suggested that there are three 
types of learning, the sensory-motor, the associative 
and the reflective. Too much emphasis cannot be 
placed upon the fact that usually the high school pupil 
is allowed to stop short of the third type of learning 
in most subjects studied. The task is not completed 
by the instructor unless he succeeds in carrying the 
pupil forward, at some time, into a beginning of the 
reflective type of learning. This, of course, assumes 
that the pupil is capable of doing some thinking, on a 
lower level, of the more abstract type, and that he is 
capable of making some generalizations in any high 
school subject whatsoever, if given adequate guidance.  
-P-A-G-E-136
      PX 
114 “SECONDARY EDUCATION 
During each year that any subject is pursued, it should 
become more and more possible for the pupil to do 
thinking of the reflective type. It is possible to train 
pupils to do this higher type of learning in some de- 
gree in the third or fourth year of study of such high 
school subjects as literature and history, as well as 
mathematics, science and foreign languages. 
One justifiable moral tag can be attached to the end 
of a discussion of this kind, namely, that high school 
instructors can, and ought to, do a great deal to see 
to it that pupils pass through all the three types of 
the learning process. This statement is especially 
applicable to all those pupils who are fortunate enough 
to pass on through the whole of the years covered by 
secondary education. This does not imply that it will 
be possible for all pupils to become equally proficient 
in the art of reflective thinking, but it does imply that 
each pupil will be trained to do the best reflective 
thinking he is capable of doing at the end of the second- 
ary school. The ways and means for accomplishing 
this purpose will necessarily vary in different situa- 
tions. The above suggestions are not too idealistic to 
be realized in a much larger way than has yet been 
done, both in the large and small secondary schools 
of the United States.

FUNDAMENTALS OF DIRECTED STUDY AND 
OF INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION AMONG 
HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
Introductory Statement.—Directed study of high 
school pupils, popularly known as supervised study, 
is worthy of serious consideration. The common 
testimony given by high school graduates is that they 
have never learned how to study successfully. The 
same confession has been made by pupils who have 
completed the elementary school. These.testimonies, 
no doubt, contain a large element of truth, due to the 
fact that classroom recitations, on the whole, have 
not placed a premium upon the methods of study used 
by pupils so much as upon the accumulation of facts 
to be reported back to instructors in charge of recita- 
tion groups. During the past decade or more, how- 
ever, a number of so-called plans of supervised study 
have been devised and used for the purpose of ena- 
bling pupils to acquire a more satisfactory method of 
study. The general assumption may be made that 
immature high school pupils will develop many inac- - 
curate and useless methods of study unless they receive 
competent direction during most, if not all, of their 
years spent in the secondary school.

  118 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Preparatory Steps in the Organization of Directed 
Study Plans 
Analysis of Factors Involved in How To Study.— 
Several preliminary or preparatory steps are neces- 
sary in order to establish an effective plan of directed 
study for high school pupils. In the first place, a de- 
tailed analysis should be made of the nature of the 
factors of the study process itself. McMurry, Strayer, 
Whipple and others have suggested certain factors. 
These are applicable to both elementary and secondary 
schools. The following paraphrased lists represent 
a composite of the various aspects enumerated by the 
above authors. 
Subjective Factors of Study.—The study process of 
the high school pupil involves his concentration upon 
a definite purpose, or upon a well-defined problem; his 
collection of facts, or data; his judgment, or evaluation 
of the worth of statements found either in oral or 
written form; his organization of evaluated facts or 
statements collected; his ability to pass judgments with 
open-mindedness, and to receive with readiness new 
facts that will necessitate the alteration or revision of 
original judgments made; his attempt to memorize and 
retain permanently those facts which have become real- 
istic and meaningful for him; his ability to use, apply, 
generalize and verify in terms of ideas and ascertained 
facts. For convenience of treatment the above list 
may be regarded as primarily subjective in nature. 
Objective Factors of Study.—Certain factors, more 
objective, mechanical and routine in nature, also have 
significance in the study process of the pupil, namely,
-P-A-G-E-141
  
  DIRECTED STUDY AND INSTRUCTION 119 
his annotation, or rewriting of notes; his underlining, 
cross-referencing and marking of original passages of 
books; his rewriting textbook statements in the form 
of abstracts, excerpts or paraphrases; his outlining of 
complicated materials; the total length of his study 
period; the distribution of the intervals of time of his 
study periods; his use of the whole, or part, method in 
memorization work; his location in physical surround- 
ings or under physical conditions most conducive to 
study; and his consciousness of physical and mental 
fatigue and overcoming of the same. 
The Need of a Technique of Supervised Study.— 
In addition to the necessity of making a detailed 
analysis of the factors involved in the study process of 
the pupil, there is the necessity of developing a definite 
technique whereby high school instructors may give 
helpful assistance to pupils in their attempts to study. 
Administratively considered, the majority of the plans 
of supervised study first evolved had to do with the 
problem of how to study in general. Furthermore, 
large emphasis was given to the mechanical division 
of time between recitation and study aspects. 
Representative Plans of Supervised Study in Use.— 
The most commonly used plans were perhaps the three 
following: General assembly or else separate study- 
room periods; the divided regular recitation, or class 
hour, into all varieties of proportions varying from 
half of the period given to recitation, and half to super- 
vised study, to the whole of the period given to super- 
vised study; and the double divided period with half 
given to recitation and half to study by pupils. The 
above represent plans used in what was at first known  
-P-A-G-E-142
  120 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
as the problem of general supervised study. In most 
of the above instances descriptions of an actual, vital 
technique of supervision used have been lacking. 
A more detailed outline of types of supervised study 
than that given in the paragraph above may be made. 
Practically all forms used so far may be catalogued 
under one or more of the following seven divisions: 
Directing individual pupils studying silently at their 
desks; directing groups of pupils in an unprepared 
lesson study; assisting individual pupils in special 
difficulties at specified times of the day upon appoint- 
ment; study in large groups in assembly rooms; sepa- 
rate study-room periods; the divided regular recitation 
hour; the divided lengthened hour; and the ‘‘laborato- 
rized’’ class hour. This last one has been discussed 
previously, in the chapter on technique of teaching. 
Individualized instruction will be discussed more fully 
later on in this chapter. 
Development of Supervised Study of Separate High 
School Subjects.—The most definite advance made 
beyond the general supervised study tendency as it 
first appeared is now to be found in the organization 
of supervised study of the separate high school sub- 
jects. It was pointed out earlier in this text that the 
technique of teaching in different high school subjects 
is now being developed to supplement general method. 
Likewise, supervised study of the special high school 
subjects is now being evolved to supplement the earlier 
general supervised study of high school pupils. The 
correlation between the technique of teaching of sepa- 
rate high school subjects and the technique of super-  
-P-A-G-E-143
  
' DIRECTED STUDY AND INSTRUCTION 121 
vised study of pupils in separate high school subjects 
is manifest. 
Directed Study in High School English, History, 
Science and Mathematics.—Because of the difference 
in the nature of the content of subject matter to be 
studied by pupils in various high school subjects, it is 
necessary that the technique of directed study used by 
instructors must vary at some points. The factors 
involved in the nature of the pupil’s study process may 
be used under wise direction in a great variety of ways 
when applied to the different high school subjects. 
Numerous examples of directed study in English, his- 
tory, mathematics and science in secondary schools 
are now available. In some schools, this procedure is 
carried out in the form of group instruction, in other 
schools, in the form of modified group instruction or 
individualized instruction. 
Practically all of the criticisms against supervised 
study have been made against ineffective plans of 
directed study rather than against the need for it, 
and rightly so. General supervised study in high 
schools has frequently fallen into disrepute because 
it was launched without sufficient preparation for its 
introduction, and with a consequent vagueness of pro- 
cedure. The development of directed study of pupils 
in separate school subjects should be encouraged be- 
cause it increases the definiteness of the technique of 
procedure, because it affords an opportunity to assist 
pupils in terms of specific problems and difficulties and 
because it enables the teachers of the respective sub- 
jects to give competent assistance and thereby relates 
 
-P-A-G-E-144

itself closely to the method of presentation by the in- 
structor. In practice, supervised study of individual 
pupils is inseparable from individualized instruction, 
so they are here discussed with relevancy in the same 
chapter. 
Individualized Instruction of High School Pupils 
General Development of Indvidual Instruction.— 
Like most tendencies or movements, the relative em- 
phasis upon individualized instruction has shifted back 
and forth from generation to generation. At certain 
times in the history of education, emphasis has been 
placed upon individual instruction of pupils, and at 
other times upon the so-called socialized recitation 
with group work of pupils. 
Earlier Examples of Individual Instruction in the 
Batavia, N. Y., Public Schools.—The Superintendent 
of Schools in Batavia, New York, under crowded con- 
ditions, where more pupils were enrolled than could 
easily be taught by one teacher, provided a system of 
class-individual instruction to meet the exigencies of 
the situation. Two teachers were provided for one 
room, one hearing recitations while the other was as- 
sisting pupils in preparing lessons. So successful did 
the practice appear to be that the Batavia system was 
widely adopted and used for a time, especially in one- 
room schools. In Pueblo, Colorado, individual in- 
struction was introduced largely as a substitute for the 
usual classroom recitation. This practice was de- 
veloped into what was known as the Pueblo system of 
instruction. 
The Dalton, Mass., High School Plan—In certain
-P-A-G-E-145
  DIRECTED STUDY AND INSTRUCTION 123 
school systems, at the present time, individualized in- 
struction has been so organized as to become largely a 
substitute for group recitations. In other school sys- 
tems it is used as a supplement to classroom periods 
of instruction. In the instance of the Dalton, Massa- 
chusetts, High School, individualized instruction rep- 
resents the chief method of procedure. With ref- 
erence to the pupil, there are no failures, no repeaters; 
and pupils having either high or low ability are per- 
mitted to advance at their own respective rates, based 
upon achievement. A pupil may spend all of his time 
on any one subject on which he chooses to work, or he 
may divide his attention among several subjects. He 
may take a test or examination upon a unit of work 
completed at the end of twenty or thirty days, at his 
own option. 
The Winnetka, Ill, Junior High School Plan.—In 
many respects, the junior high school plan of individ- 
ualized instruction used in Winnetka, Illinois, is 
similar to the Dalton plan. Individualized instruction 
is dominant in the seventh and eighth grades constitut- 
ing the junior high school, as well as in the six elemen- 
tary grades below. Whatever group instruction is 
given is merely supplemental to individual instruction. 
As in case of the Dalton plan, achievement, rather 
than time units, is the measure of the pupil’s prog- 
ress. Goal books for the seventh and eighth grades, 
used as standards, are based on what the average pupil 
can do in terms of mastery. Educational tests are 
used which were evolved by the school to supplement 
the widely used standardized achievement tests. 
Self-corrective materials are provided for pupils, and
-P-A-G-E-146
  124 SECONDARY EDUCATION © 
each pupil may ask, whenever he feels prepared to do 
so, to take his test or examination in terms of the goal 
or standard to be achieved. Pupils completing the 
units of work outlined ahead of schedule are en- 
_ couraged to supplement their studies, either with non- 
required work or with work offered in high schools 
which they are likely to attend, which has not been 
stressed in particular in the Winnetka school. 
Individualized Instruction in the University of 
Chicago High School.—Some high schools carry out 
the plan of individual instruction in certain subjects 
more largely than other subjects taught within the 
system. This is true of certain courses in English, 
mathematics and social studies in the University of 
Chicago High School. A great deal of supervision 
is given to pupils by the instructors, sometimes in 
library reference. work and sometimes within the 
regular classroom work. Whenever pupils in these 
subjects do meet in groups for the purpose of rec- 
itations, the meeting takes place after the so-called pre- 
liminary steps of ‘‘presentation,’’ ‘‘elaboration’’ and 
“‘organization’’ of materials have been taken by pupils 
under direction of instructors. This offers a means 
of developing what was earlier spoken of in terms of 
reflective learning. 
General Virtues and Limitations of Individual In- 
struction.—Clearly, certain aspects of the individual- 
ized system of instruction are similar to the type of 
supervised study that is not carried on in group form. 
Thus, in some respects, individual instruction is iden- 
tical with the directed study of pupils. In many 
instances, group instruction has become mechanical,
-P-A-G-E-147
DIRECTED STUDY AND INSTRUCTION 125 
because of the large number of pupils enrolled in 
high school classes. Under such conditions, it is al- 
most impossible to do diagnostic and remedial work 
for pupils having specific difficulties. Under individ- 
ualized instruction, advisory and remedial suggestions 
can be based upon definite errors made by pupils, and 
so corrective work can be made more effective. That 
provision can be made for the adaptation of instruc- 
tion to individual differences is evident. Whether 
high schools can be made more efficient by organizing 
the whole system into individualized instruction, or 
rather, by using it to supplement group instruction is 
yet to be seen. The limitations of individualized in- 
struction are chiefly administrative, not psychological, 
innature. In the case of large classes, modified group 
instruction in some form seems administratively to 
be almost inevitable. A compromise does seem to be 
possible, however, even where class enrollments are 
large. The number of so-called traditional, group- 
recitation classroom hours might well be reduced, in 
order to allow more time for instructors to incorporate 
into their practice the habit of giving real guidance in 
the study process itself. In short, the total number of 
hours given to the earlier recitation type of high school 
work could with profit be reduced very materially, 
and, in lieu of some of the recitation hours, directed 
study, of whatever sort seems to be of most value to 
pupils, should be introduced.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE NATURE AND USE OF INTELLIGENCE 
TESTS AND OF EDUCATIONAL MEASURE- 
MENTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 
The Nature and Development of General Intelligence 
Tests 
Historical Development.—Experimental psychology, 
several decades ago, paved the way for the develop- 
ment of the more recent general intelligence tests, in 
the form in which they now exist. An attempt was 
made to measure the sensory reactions of individuals 
with reference to weight, temperature, light, sound 
and so forth. Somewhat later on, beginnings were 
made in an effort to measure the more complex mental 
processes. 
About the time of the beginning of the World War, 
a new impetus was given to the evolving of a variety 
of mental tests. A group of prominent American 
psychologists served as a committee for the purpose of 
organizing these tests, the outcome of which was the 
formulation of the Alpha, and Beta, Army forms for 
literates, and of certain direction or performance tests 
for illiterates. Practically all of the group tests, such 
as the Otis, Terman, Haggerty, Thurstone, Illinois 
State, National Intelligence and others not here enu- 
merated, have been patterned after the original army 
128  
-P-A-G-E-151
  USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 129 
tests. The Binet-Simon test, devised in 1908, and re- 
vised in 1911, is the most widely known example of the 
individual type. 
General Nature and Purpose of Mental Tests.—The 
general purpose of intelligence tests is to measure, so 
far as is possible, the original native ability of pupils. 
The phrase ‘‘general intelligence’’ itself means the 
capacity or the ability of an individual to adapt his 
mental reactions to some new situation, or to new sets 
of problems or ideas. The Alpha and Beta tests, for 
example, are composed of what is known as a series 
or ‘‘battery’’ of tests relative to factual knowledge, 
ability to memorize in a routine or logical manner, 
correct use of language, ability to judge and reason on 
the basis of certain statements, ability to make arith- 
metical calculations of various kinds and so forth. 
Samples of the army tests, and of others, are available 
for distribution by a number of organized agencies 
throughout the country. 
All of the group tests named in the previous para- 
graph are applicable to both the junior and senior 
cycles of the high school. Group tests may be adminis- 
tered to forty or fifty or more high school pupils simul- 
taneously. In this way, a tentative distribution of 
native abilities may be ascertained. To pupils whose 
correct scores are in doubt, or to those making un- 
usually high or low scores, individual tests are usually 
given later on. The original Binet-Simon test is ap- 
plied to individuals as such, not to groups. It does 
not attempt to measure adult ability, but is applicable 
to'pupils sixteen years of ageand below. The measure 
of native ability in this test is made in terms of ‘‘men-   
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    130 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tal age’’ rather than of chronological age. ‘‘Mental 
age’’ is used to signify a degree of intelligence pos- 
sessed by the average pupil of corresponding chrono- 
logical age. This test is applicable chiefly to elemen- 
tary school pupils. Certain phases of it, however, as 
for example the vocabulary test, are applicable to 
pupils of the junior high school and the first year or 
two of the senior high school. Whipple and others 
have also devised individual tests. 
The Distribution of Intelligence Scores.—Certain 
limitations exist in the use of mental tests relative to 
obtaining perfectly reliable scores. Still, when large 
enough groups of pupils are involved there is a tend- 
ency toward a normal distribution curve. That is to 
say, the scores of relatively few pupils are found to be 
either very high, or very low. A larger number are 
high and low. Small groups within the same high 
school, or in different schools, will often tend, natu-- 
rally, to include variants from the norm, either toward 
the bottom or toward the top of the range of the scale. 
But even smaller groups, when considered over a 
period of ten years or more and in composite form, 
will tend toward a normal distribution. 
The distribution of scores shown in the accompany- 
ing figure (I) represents the intelligence scores of over 
600 freshman college students. These scores are used 
simply for illustrative purposes. Form B of the 
Terman group test was used in this instance. The 
range of. distribution extends from 80-84 to 215-219. 
Individual scores were combined in units of a dif- 
ference of five so that it would be possible to represent 
them in graphic form in a more limited space. The

numbers below the base-line represent scores, and the 
numbers in parentheses below the scores represent the 
total number of individuals receiving representative 
scores. It will be observed that the curve of distribu- 
tion is skewed toward the upper end of the base-line. 
This is probably due to two factors primarily. First, 
the group is somewhat selected and the test was per- 
haps comparatively easy for a considerable percentage 
of the students taking it. However, the range of 
scores is sufficiently great to indicate a large number 
of individual differences in terms of native general 
intelligence. Second, a general tendency toward a 
normal distribution curve is apparent. The median 
score, or that point above and below which an equal 
number of students are represented, lies between 165- 
169 and the mode, or the point at which the largest 
number of scores made by students occurred, is be- 
tween 170-174, as shown by the figure of graphic dis- 
tribution. 
The Nature and Development of Educational 
Achievement Tests 
Historical Development of Educational Measure- 
ments.—Educational measurements developed most 
rapidly at first in the field of elementary education. 
In some respects, it is justifiable to assert that the in- 
telligence tests applicable to high school pupils are 
better perfected than are educational measurements. 
Rice’s work carried on in the nineties of the nineteenth 
century, with reference to the value of drill in spelling, 
represents one of the earliest beginnings in educational  
-P-A-G-E-155
USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 133 
measurement. Much debate over, and little faith in, 
the effort made by him were reflected in magazine 
articles published, as well as in addresses made before 
large educational conferences, at that time. Cornman, 
a little later, also made certain somewhat similar in- 
vestigations in the subject of arithmetic. With the 
exception of these intermittent, pioneer attempts, little 
was done until toward the end of the first decade of 
the twentieth century. About the year 1910, educa- 
tional tests began to multiply more rapidly in elemen- 
tary school subjects, and to some extent in high school 
subjects. 
General Nature and Purpose of Educational Tests.— 
In contrast with general intelligence tests, the purpose 
of standardized educational measurements is to deter- 
mine the achievements, accomplishments or perform- 
ances of pupils in specific school subjects. They are, 
therefore, designed to measure the influence of nurture 
and of training rather than the inherited native capac- 
ity of individuals to react. 
Some Examples of Educational Tests in Elementary 
Schools.—Representative tests applicable to elemen- 
tary school subjects have been devised by Thorndike 
and by Ayres in handwriting; by Stone, Courtis, 
Thorndike, Monroe, Buckingham and Woody respec- 
tively in arithmetic; by Ayres, Buckingham and Jones 
respectively in spelling; and by Gray, Kelly and Mon- 
roe respectively in oral and silent reading. 
Some Examples of Educational Tests in High 
Schools.—The routine or drill aspects and the factual 
knowledge of school subjects lend themselves most 
readily to quantitative measurement. Such aspects
-P-A-G-E-156
  134 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
occur in a larger way in the elementary school than 
in the secondary school, so that the development of 
educational tests has not been so rapid nor so satis- 
factory, perhaps, in the field of secondary as of elemen- 
tary education. There are, however, many routine 
and factual aspects of high school instruction that are 
subject also to measurement. That is to say, certain 
elements of drill and routine need to be emphasized in 
case of all of the subjects begun in high school. Rou- 
tine and factual elements can be tested and measured, 
for example, in certain aspects of English language 
and composition, reading, the first year’s work in 
foreign languages, the first year’s work in mathe- 
matics, elementary high school science and the factual 
elements of history. 
Examples of a limited and representative number 
of high school scales and tests are listed below: 
Charter’s Language and Grammar Scales, based upon 
the errors made by pupils in the use of pronouns and 
verbs; language completion tests by Trabue, and by 
others; the Thorndike, Harvard-Newton, Nassau 
County Supplement of Hillegas’s and Willing scales 
of composition; silent reading tests by Monroe, and by 
Kelly; Henmon’s, and also Starch’s, Latin tests; 
Handschin’s modern language tests; Rugg and 
Clark’s, Monroe’s, Minnick’s and Hotz’s tests in alge- 
bra and geometry; Barr’s, Harlan’s and Van Wagen- 
en’s tests in history; and Starch’s tests in science. It 
is impossible, here, to give a complete list of the scores 
of tests that have been devised for use in high schools 
alone. Such lists can be gotten from the various text-
-P-A-G-E-157
USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 135 
books and magazine articles which discuss the prob- 
lems of educational measurements in detail. 
Distribution of Standard Achievement Scores, and 
School Marks.—Individual mental differences can 
also be shown in case of educational measurements. 
In the accompanying table, it will be observed that the 
scores of high school pupils measured by the Monroe 
silent reading test tend toward a normal distribution 
in each of the years of the high school. The range 
of the variation of scores may be seen from the table 
itself. For example, in the freshman year, the range 
extends from a score of .9 up to 59.9; in the sophomore 
year, from 4.9 up to 79.9; in the junior year from 3.9 
up to 79.9; and in the senior year, from 6.9 up to 79.9. 
The comprehension scores in the Monroe Silent 
Reading Test represent a composite of all of the pupils 
of eight separate high schools in one county. By 
grouping on the same base-line the scores for the 
pupils of the freshman, sophomore, junior and senior 
years, a comparison of the distributions can be made. 
In case other educational achievement tests were 
given, in algebra, for example, it would be found again, 
that scores would tend to spread over a comparatively 
wide range, as would be true, likewise, in the tests for 
vocabulary in first year Latin. 
Ordinary school marks are not wholly satisfactory 
in many respects. Many unfortunate variations exist 
in marking systems. Still, even with their apparent 
weaknesses, school marks do serve some valuable ad- 
ministrative purposes. The accompanying figure (II) 
represents the composite marks given in mathematics
-P-A-G-E-158
136 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to 589 pupils in three different high schools. Scores of 
intelligence tests, scores of educational achievement 
tests and high school marks when groups are large 
enough and not too highly selected, will tend to dis- 
tribute themselves according to a normal frequency 
curve. The numbers below the base-line represent 
Comprehension Scores of the Monroe Silent Reading Test.

The Administrative and Supervisory Use of Intelligence 
and of Educational Achievement Tests 
The Tendency To Measure Results in All Fields of 
Activity—During recent years, an increasing tend- 
dency has appeared in the form of the desire to know 
actual results and outputs in industrial and business 
institutions. Platitudinally, this has been charac- 
terized under the heading“ of efficiency. This interest 
in a knowledge of results through accurate objective 
measurement and standards has been evidenced in a 
variety of ways in terms of the nature and the organi- 
zation of the above types of institutions. Various 
types of work are given to different individuals who 
presumably are specialists in the various phases or 
activities represented. An illustration, for example, 
may be found in the employment of specialists by the 
associated meat-packing industries of the United 
States to make chemical analyses of the food values of 
meats. Another example may be found in the em- 
ployment of efficiency experts with reference to certain 
phases of work in electrical plants; another, in the 
employment of efficiency experts in manufacturing 
plants; another, in the employment of different in- 
dividuals whose business is to buy or to sell in terms 
of the lowest costs and the highest profits; another, in 
the employment, by the public utility corporations, of 
general managers whose business is to map out a
-P-A-G-E-161
  
USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 139 
policy for a working program for several years ahead. 
Other concrete examples may be observed, in the vari- 
ous phases of urban life, as well as here and there in 
agricultural centers, of this same general tendency to 
produce results effectively, and to prevent undue waste 
of energy and materials. Beginnings, fundamental 
though meager, have been made. The tendencies indi- 
cated in this paragraph are worthy of serious consider- 
ation by all high school officers. 
Tendency To Measure Results in Education—The 
general analogies between the above tendencies as 
manifested in various fields of activity, and the second- 
ary school situation at the present time, are evident. 
The products of social institutions are more difficult 
to measure, quantitatively, than those of industrial 
plants. Still, an honest effort is now being made to 
measure the achievements and results of social institu- 
tions. This is becoming increasingly true in the ad- 
ministration and supervision of school systems. 
During the first three quarters of a century after the 
first public high school was established in America, 
no record of any very serious attempts to measure 
quantitatively the results of teaching in secondary 
schools can be found. At the present time, the meas- 
urement of the results of teaching has assumed pro- 
portions sufficiently large to be characterized as a 
significant tendency or movement in elementary and 
secondary education. This is especially true of work 
in the grades of the junior high school and below, and 
work corresponding to that done in these grades. As 
the technique of measurement becomes more and more 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  140 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
perfect, there is no reason to believe that a distinct 
service cannot also be rendered to the senior high 
school. 
Homogeneous Grouping of High School Pupils in 
General 
Recognition of Individual Mental Differences among 
Pupils—Physically, intellectually and socially con- 
sidered, high school pupils differ from one another. 
Human traits, of one sort or another, tend to distribute 
themselves according to the so-called probability, or 
bell-shaped, curve, in the event that the group con- 
sidered is not too small and not too highly selected, 
relative to the trait involved. This tenet applies to 
all races, civilized and uncivilized. The largest single 
illustrative example of the existence of individual dif- 
ferences among adults is to be found in the graphic 
curve of distribution representing the enlisted men of 
the United States Army during the World War. It 
will be recalled that the scores of the 82,000 literate 
enlisted men as a whole made approximately a sym- 
metrically shaped curve, whereas the curve represent- 
ing the Officers’ Training Corps was skewed toward the 
top of the base-line, and the curve representing the 
relatively illiterate enlisted men was skewed distinctly 
toward the bottom of the base-line. 
The largest groups of individuals assembled in con- 
venient form for administering mental tests and meas- 
urements in times of peace are found in the elementary 
and secondary schools of America. The total number 
of pupils in the junior and senior high schools of

America is between three and four millions. In case 
the total scores made by this group were plotted 
graphically, the result would be a normal distribution 
curve similar to that representing the 82,000 literate 
enlisted men of the Army. In general, the super- 
normal pupils and the subnormal pupils would repre- 
sent intelligence scores corresponding, respectively, to 
those of the Officers’ Training Corps, and to those of 
the illiterate group of the Army. 
Physical Differences of Pupils.—Pupils differ from 
one another not only with reference to native mental 
ability, and with reference to scholastic achievement, 
but physically and socially as well. Physical differ- 
ences are due chiefly, if not solely, to the laws of bio- 
logical heredity. Some of the factors involved, in 
terms of biological heredity, are bodily stature, size, 
height, weight and so forth; color of hair, eyes and 
skin; shape of head, and racial physiognomical struc- 
ture in general. Twelve-, fourteen-, and sixteen-year- 
old pupils will vary in size, weight and height within 
their respective groups. Objective measurements and 
comparisons relative to physical traits can be made 
with comparative ease. It is thus possible to establish 
norms of height and weight, as well as to determine 
corresponding height-weight coefficients of respective 
pupils. It is pertinent to remark here that it is more 
profitable to compare the physical measurements of a 
group, or of individuals as such, with previous meas- 
urements of the same group of the same individuals, 
than it is merely to compare, at random, any group 
with another group of pupils. In the former way, it is 
possible to have a more satisfactory basis of compari-
-P-A-G-E-165

son. In a later chapter it will be shown that physical 
difference of pupils is only one aspect of the health 
program now well initiated in high schools. Social 
differences of pupils are also educationally significant, 
but will not be discussed until later in this text. 
Means Used for Homogeneous Grouping.—The 
practice of grouping pupils homogeneously, on the 
basis of similar mental abilities, has come widely into 
vogue, during recent years, in junior and senior high 
schools. The most widely used means for grouping 
pupils thus are the scores made, respectively, in taking 
intelligence tests and in educational measurements in 
the respective school subjects. Of these two means, 
the first has been the most widely used thus far in high 
schools. School marks made by pupils during their 
attendance in the upper elementary school grades have 
been used freely, also, to supplement scores made in 
taking standardized tests. General estimates of pu- 
pils’ abilities given by high school teachers are some- 
times used as a fourth supplementary means of 
grouping. 
The Relative Value of Homogeneous Grouping.—In- 
telligence tests and standard educational measure- 
ments are not as yet fool-proof means for determining 
mental differences of individuals, but they serve as the 
most ready means for this purpose so far devised. No 
doubt, administrative efficiency may result from allo- 
eating pupils into three or four groups. At the same 
time, it should be remembered that the differences 
existing among individuals within any one designated 
group are greater than the differences between the 
three or four groups. This statement applies to large 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
144 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
groups such as the different races, as well as to the 
smaller groups, such as high school pupils. Pedagog- 
ically speaking, arranging pupils according to three or 
four ability groups for administrative purposes should 
not become a substitute for giving attention to the in- 
dividual needs of each student. No matter in which 
one of the larger groups a pupil may chance to appear, 
each one should be given individual attention within 
this group so far as it is practicable to give it to him. 
In short, homogeneous grouping, administratively con- 
sidered, should be regarded as the complement or sup- 
plement of individualized instruction, rather than a 
substitute for it. 
The Adaptation of Subject Matter and Methods of High 
School Subjects to Varying Abilities of Pupils 
Adaptation of Subject Matter to All Abilities —Com- 
paratively speaking, little progress has yet been made 
in meeting the need of adapting subject matter taught 
to the abilities of all the pupils enrolled in respective 
classes. To group pupils homogeneously is really only 
the beginning of the educational task. Not only the 
quality of subject matter, but also the method of pres- 
entation should be different for pupils ranked as 
superior and inferior respectively. In some degree, 
the above desideratum has always been recognized and 
provided for by the most competent instructors. By 
systematizing such procedure, however, it is possible 
not only to increase the efficiency of competent in- 
structors, but also to assist those instructors who tend
-P-A-G-E-167
USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 145 
to overlook the need for adaptation to all types of pu- 
pil abilities. 
Concrete Examples of Allocating Pupils—In a 
number of high school systems, it has become custom- 
ary to allocate pupils into different class groups in the 
separate high school subjects. Usually this practice is 
begun in a limited number of subjects. Sometimes it 
is used in English classes and sometimes in mathe- 
matics or other subjects, depending somewhat upon 
the nature of the local situation. It is now becoming 
customary for officers of secondary schools to familiar- 
ize themselves with facts and conditions of the ele- 
mentary schools which furnish students to the 
respective high schools. In some instances, general 
intelligence tests and educational achievement tests 
are given to elementary school pupils. The average 
standing of these pupils in at least two of the academic 
subjects studied in the elementary school is ascertained, 
covering the full time of attendance. An attempt is 
also made to supplement the three above items by ask- 
ing elementary school officers to make general estimates 
of the promise and prospects of these pupils upon en- 
tering high school, as well as to secure some further 
data concerning the pupil’s industry or other charac- 
teristics important in school success. 
‘When such elementary pupils enter the high schools, 
therefore, considerable is already known concerning 
their previous school history and progress in terms of 
aptitudes, accomplishments and general attitudes and 
interests. Pupils have then been tentatively grouped in 
English or mathematics classes, and are subject to
-P-A-G-E-168
146 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
transfer at certain intervals, depending upon their 
ability to continue in, fall below, or go above the groups 
in which they were originally placed. The respective 
groups have been allowed to complete the same amount 
of work at different rates or in different amounts of 
time. Some groups are permitted to accomplish the 
work mapped out in one semester, some in two and 
some in three. In the majority of instances, wherever 
this allocating of pupils has come into vogue, insuffi- 
cient time has as yet elapsed for devising a plan for 
taking care in detail of the superior pupils who are 
capable of doing the work in much less than the usual 
allotted time. Suffice it to say, at this point, that of- 
ficers in the schools which are able to carry on this 
preliminary work with success will be original enough 
to work out plans for caring for those pupils who are 
especially gifted. 
In any event, the above type of procedure should be 
gradually introduced into only one or more depart- 
ments of a school system, and always placed in the 
hands of competent instructors when it is attempted. 
Under poor direction, the plan will certainly fail, even 
in the larger high schools. It is useless to recommend 
homogeneous grouping in the literal sense in the very 
small high schools. Certain aspects may be modified, 
however, so as to be applicable. The recognition of 
individual differences is pertinent in small schools as 
well as in large. It is thinkable that in a group of a 
half dozen pupils a considerable range of ability might 
be represented. The use of tests and the diagnostic 
and remedial work essential in large high schools are
-P-A-G-E-169
  USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 147 
also applicable to small high schools, with larger pro- 
portionate emphasis upon individual attention and in- 
struction. 
A number of practical problems arise wherever 
homogeneous grouping is in use. For example, what 
further provision shall be made for students who are 
capable of doing in three years the amount of work 
outlined for average students to be done in four? 
Shall they be engaged in the additional pursuit of 
other subject matter of a wider variety? Shall they 
be encouraged to engage in more of the social and 
extra-curricular activities in case they are not already 
doing so, and remain within the school system four 
years rather than three, thereby becoming more mature 
before leaving the secondary school? These debatable 
questions cannot be easily answered by a mere dog- 
matic statement accompanied by a gesture of the hand 
or toss of the head. Merely to mark or count one more 
year of time has little virtue, if any. In case the ad- 
ditional subjects pursued or the additional activities 
engaged in by the superior pupil becomes merely a per- 
functory matter, this procedure does not justify itself. 
Then too, it must not be forgotten that mental and even 
social maturity is more than a matter of merely a 
chronological year or two. Some pupils are as mature 
at sixteen as others are at eighteen, and some are as 
mature at eighteen as others are at twenty. 
‘Whenever superior pupils are permitted to telescope 
the work of six years of the junior-senior high school 
into five or less, or the work of the traditional four year 
high school into three or three and one-half years, it
-P-A-G-E-170
  148 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
is obvious that several provisions should be made. In 
the first place, provision should be made that the pupil 
may do not only a higher quality of work than the aver- 
age and inferior students do, but that he may do such 
a high quality of work as to use up his own capacity 
to the highest degree. In the second place, merely 
to provide enough additional subject matter or social 
and extra-curricular activities to require him to remain 
four rather than three years is at least not psychologi- 
cally justifiable. Provision should be made so that 
the additional subject matter and activities required 
will become educative in the highest sense for him. 
On the other hand, in case he is allowed to complete 
his work in less than the ordinarily allotted time, then, 
in fairness to him, some recognition of his superior 
ability should be given by higher institutions of learn- 
ing which he may, perchance, later attend. 
Precautions Necessary When Ability Grouping Is 
Used.—For sociological reasons, great precautions 
need to be taken when pupils are homogeneously 
grouped lest they become too conscious of mental and 
social stratifications. This can be avoided, chiefly 
through the spirit and method of administration used 
by school officers. Caution needs to be used, too, lest 
the resulting accelerated promotions cause to be 
forgotten the necessity of a certain amount of drill 
and repetition of facts essential to the pupil’s later 
progress. Admittedly, an overemphasis has often 
been placed in the past upon the treadmill group work 
of the seventh and eighth grades. Care needs to be 
used in ability grouping, especially of the superior and 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  
USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 149 
average pupils, lest there be a tendency to underrate 
the real virtue which is to be found in a proper amount 
of the drill work essential to the establishment and 
formation of the more or less routine and mechanical 
habits of use of language, English and foreign, in the 
junior high school grades, and habits in these subjects, 
and others, in the later senior high school grades. 
That is to say, when pupils are organized for purposes 
of class instruction into high, low and medium, or 
other speed groups, the need of repetition and habit 
formation with respect to certain fundamentals in 
the pupil’s learning processes should be clearly recog- 
nized. This, of course, does not mean that the same 
amount of time will be required for drill work in the 
upper as in the lower group. The third precaution 
has to do with the element of administrative uniform- 
ity. The traditional school system overemphasized 
“lock step’? and mechanical practices. A certain 
amount of desirable uniformity of procedure did result 
in spite of the too frequent deadening influence. The 
attempt to develop each pupil according to his in- 
herited ability will not work automatically. Even 
more painstaking care is required to make ability 
grouping a success, than to make the so-called 
“lock step’? system work successfully. Whenever 
school systems attempt to organize speed groups, the 
attempt should be preceded by much preparation and 
study. It is not the purpose of homogeneous group- 
ing to eliminate the factor of uniformity of procedure 
and of results, but to retain only those aspects of 
uniformity that are most highly desirable.

The Function and Service of Departments of Ref- 
erence and Research in Secondary Schools 
Interrelation of Administrative and Supervisory 
Activities—Theoretically, for purposes of analysis, 
it is possible to separate the administrative and super- 
visory aspects of high school instruction. In practice 
the two aspects overlap very much. This is true in 
the instance of the use of intelligence tests and edu- 
cational measurements in the high school. As indi- 
cated by Monroe and others, those aspects subject to 
measurement may be considered under three major 
heads, namely, administrative and supervisory, class- 
room instruction and experiment and research. This 
will include such problems as bases and rates of pro- 
motion of pupils, diagnostic and remedial work in 
instruction, the construction of satisfactory high school 
curricula, the devising and evaluating of marking sys- 
tems and the organization and determination of prob- 
lems suitable for further experimentation and research. 
Recent Organization of High School Departments of 
Reference and Research.—Many hopeful omens are 
appearing from time to time in the field of secondary 
education. In the past, it has often been customary 
for assistant superintendents or vice-principals to be 
mere figureheads without any definite responsibilities. 
At present, assistant superintendents in a number of 
large cities have been delegated to oversee and super- 
vise the problems of the secondary schools. Assistants 
to high school principals have been placed in an ad- 
visory capacity with the responsibility of serving as 
clearing house agents for these institutions as wholes.
-P-A-G-E-173
USE OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 151 
Beginnings have been made in a wholesome division of 
labor in other aspects, such as, for example, deanships 
of men, deanships of women, and educational or vo- 
cational counsellorships. 
In the larger high schools, departments of reference 
and research are now being gradually organized. 
Sometimes these are created in conjunction with col- 
leges of Education or university bureaus of research 
and sometimes wholly within the high schools them- 
selves. The work of a limited number of such de- 
partments created within the high schools has been 
reported. One high school has announced such phases 
of this work as supervision and interpretation of in- 
telligence tests and educational measurements; ex- 
tended analysis and study of the school marks given 
by all the separate teachers within their departments, 
as well as the marks given by departments as a whole, 
with a view toward the improvement of present prac- 
tice; and establishment and organization of a guidance 
and student advisory system. 
The records resulting from various types of studies 
made by the department of research are placed in the 
hands of the various high school departments inter- 
ested for further use and for permanent preservation. 
Instructional costs; use of buildings; preparation of 
blank forms to be used for making records of all sorts, 
including tests and measurements; preparation of 
graphic charts; and preparation of reliable statistical 
tables to be used for publicity purposes, are some of 
the general problems with which the departments of 
reference and research in some high schools have to do. 
In the smaller high schools it will devolve upon
-P-A-G-E-174
  152 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the principals and instructional staffs to carry on such 
phases of the work indicated above as are adapted to 
local conditions. In both large and small high schools, 
where it is not practicable to establish departments of 
research, it is possible for principals and instructors 
to codperate with colleges of Education and bureaus of 
research in the universities. 
Since departments of research in high schools are 
young and limited in number as yet, it is impossible 
to estimate their value in any final way. Through 
them it is possible, no doubt, to correlate and unify 
all of the interests and practices of the institutions 
involved. And one of their important functions 
should be the administration of mental tests and meas- 
urements, and the use and interpretation of the results.

  CHAPTER IX 
SOME ASPECTS OF THE HISTORY OF 
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 
Introduction.—No attempt is here made to give an 
exhaustive treatment of the historical aspects of 
Kuropean secondary education. This has already 
been done by a number of writers emphasizing es- 
pecially the period of the nineteenth century. Rus- 
sell’s German Higher Schools and Farrington’s 
French Secondary Schools are two instances in point. 
In order to appreciate fully the fundamentals of sec- 
ondary education, it is necessary for a student to have 
some consciousness of the historical perspective of 
European as well as of American secondary education. 
The present purpose is to rehearse only a sufficient 
number of facts to give the student a general running 
commentary on some of the problems which have been 
and are now considered important. 
Some Reasons for Knowing European Schools.—In 
Europe, and especially in Prussia, secondary educa- 
tion is usually characterized by the use of the phrase 
‘higher schools.’ For several reasons, students 
should possess some knowledge of foreign secondary 
schools. In the first place, such knowledge furnishes 
the background for a larger educational perspective. 
Most tendencies develop out of very simple beginnings 
156
-P-A-G-E-179
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 157 
into more complex fruitions and expressions. The 
study of European backgrounds tends to cultivate a 
genetic type of consciousness in individuals, which is 
essential in attempting to evaluate fundamentals. In 
the second place, such knowledge makes it possible to 
compare the similar and dissimilar social ideals which 
have clearly expressed themselves in the secondary 
education of Europe and America. In the third place, 
it makes it possible to compare different forms of 
school organization and their corresponding curricula. 
In the fourth place, it furnishes an opportunity to 
note such aspects as-the freedom or rigidity with which 
the principle of election of studies has operated. In 
the fifth =. it makes it possible to witness the in- 
fluence upon each country of such tendencies as hu- 
manism and realism, and to observe the direct and 
indirect influence of European theory and practice 
upon such specific problems in America as vocational 
education and continuation schools. Lastly, it enables 
individuals to compare the ages at which pupils began 
certain school subjects in the earlier schools of Amer- 
ica with the corresponding ages in European practice, 
and in our own modern junior-senior high school prac- 
tices. 
The direct influence of European theory and practice 
upon the secondary schools of America has at times 
been overestimated by writers and public speakers. 
Comparison by way of contrast is as important as 
comparison by way of similarity, in certain instances, 
in European and American situations. On the whole 
then, it is important for students to have some knowl- 
edge of European backgrounds in order that both
-P-A-G-E-180
  158 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
similar and dissimilar aspects may be observed and 
analyzed, and that both direct and indirect influences 
may be detected relative to European and American 
education. In general, it may be correctly assumed 
that the influence of England upon early American 
secondary education was more direct and pronounced 
than that of any other foreign country. 
Two Dominant Tendencies Influencing the Nature of 
Curricula in the Higher Schools of Europe » 
The Humanistic Influence—In all fields certain 
tendencies and influences are, at one time or other, 
outstanding. The Romantic Movement, for example, 
is recognized by writers and teachers of literature. 
In the field of the history of philosophy, the influence 
of Rationalism and that of Empiricism are evident in 
the various treatises written relative to the theory or 
problem of knowledge. In the field of political science, 
in certain countries, the influence of Conservative and 
Liberal parties is evident in policies established. In 
the field of natural science, certain theories have been 
recognized as the basis of corresponding explanations 
of physical phenomena. 
Similarly, in the history of secondary education, 
two very dominant tendencies have influenced and 
colored the nature of the curricula in the higher schools 
of Europe, covering an interval of three or four cen- 
turies or more. These two general tendencies are 
known by the names of humanism and realism. They 
are so comprehensive and so consequential that it is 
impossible to overemphasize them. It is also difficult,
-P-A-G-E-181
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN BUROPE 159 
in this brief presentation, to make their nature wholly 
clear. This difficulty is increased by the fact that the 
words ‘‘realism’’ and ‘‘humanism’’ have meant, re- 
spectively, different things in different periods of the 
history of education. In short, they represent the 
two most important influences on the nature of second- 
ary school curricula up to the end of the nineteenth 
century. During the whole of the nineteenth century, 
a constant contention was carried on as to whether 
these two phases should represent equal or unequal, 
inferior or superior, places in secondary or higher 
school curricula. Not until after the middle of the 
nineteenth century was there any distinct tendency to 
recognize them as on a par when they were incorpo- 
rated in the established schools. 
Meaning of Humanism.—In general, the early 
humanistic content of the curriculum referred to the 
ancient classics of Latin and Greek. Humanism, used 
in its broadest sense, summed up an attempt to ex- 
press the best of the whole life of the ancient Latin 
and Greek peoples. The subjects of Latin and Greek 
were used as the means for this realization. At cer- 
tain times humanism expressed itself in a much nar- 
rower form. Under such conditions, the classics were 
formalistically studied as ends in themselves. Cicero- 
nianism was an expression of this narrower tendency 
during the sixteenth century. 
Specific Influence of Humanism upon Established 
Schools.—The practical influence of humanism was 
evidenced in the establishment of many higher schools 
throughout the leading European countries of France, 
Germany and England. These evidences appeared all
-P-A-G-E-182
160 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the way along from the time of the Renaissance, and 
before, up to the end of the nineteenth century, and 
thereafter. The gymnasia of Prussia and modified 
forms, the lycées of France and the communal colleges 
and the grammar and public schools of England were 
representative types of institutions through which the 
humanistic tendency expressed ‘itself. Without ces- 
sation at any time, from the middle of the sixteenth 
century to the end of the nineteenth century, humanism 
was the most dominant factor affecting the nature of 
the content of curricula in the secondary schools es- 
tablished in Europe. 
Beginnings of the expression of humanism were to 
be witnessed in the liberal arts work of the Ancient 
Greeks, in the later grammar and rhetorical schools of 
the Romans and in that part of the so-called ‘‘Seven 
Liberal Arts’’ known as the trivium, organized per- 
manently in the fifth and sixth centuries a.p. Thus 
the taproot tendency of humanism extends back into 
ancient times, continues dominantly in the form of 
Latin throughout the Middle Age period and then re- 
mains to become strongly entrenched within the or- 
ganized secondary schools of Europe from the middle 
of the sixteenth on into the twentieth century. 
Humanism and the Higher Schools of France.—The 
influence of the ‘‘Seven Liberal Arts’’ upon the early 
secondary schools of France is clear. The College of 
d’Harcourt was established in 1180: It was predom- 
inantly a school of the secondary type. The college 
of Clermont, established in 1563, later on became one 
of the humanistic types of lycées of Paris, emphasiz- 
ing primarily a study of Latin and Greek. The con-

tent of the curriculum of the College de Guyenne at 
Bordeaux in 1572 consisted chiefly of Ciceronian writ- 
ings. The Jesuit order organized a plan or system of 
studies known technically as the Ratio Studiorum, in 
1599, which remained practically unmodified for hun- 
dreds of years. The plan of studies was constituted 
almost solely of Latin content. This system of studies 
remained intact and unchanged until the year 1882. 
The later development of lycées will be referred to 
again in this chapter. 
Humanism and Higher Schools in Germany.—In the 
instance of the organization of secondary schools in 
Prussia during the sixteenth century, the humanistic 
tendency was uppermost. Sturm’s Gymnasium was 
established in 1538, at Strassburg. At first, Latin and 
Greek were offered to the exclusion of such subjects as 
history, mathematics and natural sciences. The com- 
plete course was ten years in length. In 1565, almost 
three decades after the establishment of this gym- 
nasium, an examination of the curriculum shows that 
the content of the first five years consisted of a study 
of the Latin alphabet, declensions, conjugations, gram- 
matical constructions and style of Cicero, and that the 
content of the last five years of the course was supple- 
mented with Greek, with an increasing emphasis upon 
versification, rhetoric, logic and oratory in both Latin 
and Greek. As was true of the plan of studies of the 
Jesuit Order, the Strassburg course remained intact 
for centuries. Historically considered, this gym- 
nasium is very important since it became the model 
or pattern of all gymnasia established thereafter, up 
to the close of the nineteenth century. Humanism
-P-A-G-E-184
  162 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
reached its high tide of expression during the sixteenth 
century, and, as previously suggested, had by that 
time become highly formalistic in nature. 
Humanism and the Secondary Schools in England.— 
Humanism was more prominent than any other aspect 
in England from the time of the establishment of its 
first secondary schools. The beginnings of the gram- 
mar schools date back to the Middle Ages. The 
so-called great ‘‘public schools’’ of England were or- 
ganized from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century 
inclusive, and in them the classical emphasis was 
strong. As Sturm’s School became the model in 
Prussia, so did Colet’s School, established in 1509 at 
St. Paul’s, become the model of a long list of later 
classical secondary schools established in England. 
And these schools in turn, as will be indicated again 
later on, became the prototypes of the first grammar 
schools transplanted almost bodily to America. Colet 
had been influenced by the humanistic education em- 
phasized in the universities, especially at Oxford. 
Humanism had become very influential at Cambridge 
University about the close of the fifteenth century. 
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it de- 
veloped into a narrow and empty formalism in the 
schools of England. 
Influence of Realism in General.—It is more diffi- 
cult to trace out with distinct definiteness the influence 
of realism on school organization previous to the 
eighteenth century, than that of humanism. Still, it 
is possible to trace out its influence in general in terms 
of the scientific movement. The early impetus given 
to an emphasis upon sense-realism came about as a
-P-A-G-E-185
SEATS TA i 8 PTE he hap me Oe tree anne Sipe Mate S Sees INGE Neate ean ea 
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 163 
result of the discoveries and inventions of the fifteenth 
and sixteenth cetituries. Such inventions as the tele- 
scope and the barometer, and such discoveries as the 
circulation of the blood in the human body, together 
with microscopic demonstrations, and the law of grav- 
itation, for example, led to a new type of thinking and 
to new attitudes. The sense-realism movement as an 
expression of the new scientific consciousness con- 
tinued, with great prominence, into the seventeenth 
century. The University of Halle was established in 
1692, and the content of its curriculum, sponsored by 
such men as Francke and others, was realistic in na- 
| ture. Hecker was influential in transferring the real- 
| istic type of instruction of the pietists to Berlin, in | 
which place, in 1747, a widely known Realschule was | 
_ established. Out of this eighteenth century back- 
ground grew the numerous realschulen and their 
modified forms which were organized during the nine- 
teenth and twentieth centuries throughout Europe. 
Meaning of Realism.—Confusion of thinking may 
easily result from the use of the word ‘‘realism,’’ 
since various meanings have been attached to it from 
time to time. Middle Age realism had to do with the 
metaphysical problem of reality. It referred to the 
abstract or_intellectualistic discussions of universal 
ideas and notions. For convenience, therefore, it may 
be characterized as abstract, having little regard for 
individual concrete experience. The sixth book of 
Plato’s Republic furnishes an illustration of the ab- 
stract realistic discussion of the type mentioned. 
Certain writers in the history of education refer to 
three types of realism. The first, known as humanistic-   
 
-P-A-G-E-186
Se er eo eee 
164 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
realism, emphasized the content of ancient life in terms 
of words and ideas rather than the mere form of an- 
cient classics; the second, social-realism, emphasized 
the classics primarily as a means of expressing the 
actual life-experiences, as a whole, of ancient peoples; 
the third, sense-realism, consists of two aspects, the 
psychological aspect, which refers to the development 
of knowledge in the individual through the use of the 
senses and reason, and the content of studies such as 
natural sciences, mathematics, history and modern lan- 
guages. Certain aspects of the first two types of 
modern realism are similar to humanism as discussed 
earlier. In the present discussion it is sense-realism 
which is referred to in contrast to the humanistic tend- 
ency in general. 
Representative Types of Modern Higher Schools 
in Europe 
Influence of Social Stratifications—It will be re- 
called that Plato’s system of education assumed that 
society was divided into three classes, namely, the 
rulers or philosophers, the soldiers or guardians of 
the state and the servants or industrial workers. His 
educational system was created for the service and 
the sake of the state. It was made in every way to 
conform to the aristocratic ideals of his utopian state. 
Certain analogies exist between the modern European 
situation, and that of Plato’s theory of education. In 
the leading European countries, society was also strati- 
fied into highly distinct classes, upper and lower. 
This social situation has influenced the ideals and or-  
-P-A-G-E-187
  SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 165 
ganization of secondary schools in France, Germany 
and England very considerably. Higher schools are 
attended chiefly, therefore, by the so-called élite upper 
classes, rather than by the common people or peasants. 
The result is that a dual school system has been devel- 
oped, one for the masses, and another for the select 
classes. During earlier times, this meant that it was 
almost impossible for pupils attending the common 
schools ever to transfer to higher schools, should they 
desire to do so. Pupils completing the elementary 
schools in the early teens, cut short of further school- 
ing, could do nothing else than enter unskilled occu- 
pations. During the last quarter of a century certain 
reforms have made it somewhat more easy to make 
the transfer. Moreover, those pupils desiring to con- 
tinue their education can enter the continuation and 
vocational schools. The establishment of the so-called 
middle schools has also made it possible for a wider 
range of pupils to go beyond the elementary schools. 
But the general policy is, in Europe, not to unify, 
through an educational ladder, elementary education, 
as such, and secondary education. One of the out- 
standing contrasts, therefore, between the situation in 
these foreign countries and that in our own is to be 
found in their lack of an educational ladder, the pur- 
pose of which in America is to preserve the continuity 
of elementary and secondary education. 
Pre-Secondary Schools for Boys in Germany, France 
and England.—The secondary schools in European 
countries are not coeducational. The schools for the 
lower social classes, however, as, for example, the 
volkschulen in Prussia, are coeducational, as is true in
-P-A-G-E-188
  166 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the other countries. Boys in Prussia enter the vor- 
schulen at six years of age for three years of prepara- 
tory training. At nine years of age they may enter 
either the schools having nine-year courses or those 
having six-year courses. Boys from the upper classes 
in France enter the preparatory division at the age of 
six or seven, pass on into the elementary division at 
eight or nine and then enter the lycées proper at about 
the age of ten. As previously suggested in the case of 
Prussia, so in France, the school which a boy may at- 
tend is very largely determined by his previous social 
and economic status. Boys from the higher classes in 
England, after having taken the preparatory course of 
three years, enter the secondary schools proper at the 
age of about thirteen or fourteen. In all three of these 
countries, especially in France and England, it is pos- 
sible for pupils to do their pre-secondary work in 
schools not attached directly to the secondary school 
proper. 
Types of Higher Schools in Prussia.—In terms of 
the nature of the subject matter offered, Prussian 
higher schools are divided into three types, namely, 
ultra-classical, semi-classical al_and_ non-classical. The 
gymnasiums, realgymmasium and ‘Oberrealschtile, each 
nine years in length, belong to the above types respec- 
tively. The progymnasium, realprogymnasium and 
realschule are each six years in length and also, re- 
spectively, are representative of the same three types. 
Administrative rigidity exists, in general, among the 
higher schools of Prussia. Early choices and little 
opportunity for later election of studies by pupils are 
characteristic. Recent action and legislation have
-P-A-G-E-189
  
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 167 
brought about a certain amount of change, but, com- 
' paratively speaking, very little with reference to 
flexibility. 
Types of Higher Schools in France.—Fouillée wrote 
concerning education from a national standpoint dur- 
ing the last decade of the nineteenth century, and 
maintained vigorously that the classical element should 
be dominant in secondary schools. More flexibility, 
more choice on the part of pupils, has existed in the 
lycées and communal colleges, the representative 
secondary schools for boys in France, than in the cor- 
responding institutions in Prussia. Lycées were 
usually established in urban centers, and communal 
colleges in the more outlying or rural centers, the first 
being supported by the state, and the second by the 
communes. 
The lycée is constituted of two cycles of work, a 
four-year cycle and a three-year cycle. In the first, 
four-year cycle, a Latin and a non-Latin course are 
offered between which pupils may choose. In the first 
two years of the second cycle pupils may elect one of 
four courses, Classical, Latin-Modern Language, Latin- 
Scientific and Science-Modern Language. In the last 
year of the second cycle, students elect between phi- 
losophy and mathematics. The nature of the content 
of the work offered in communal colleges does not 
differ markedly from that of the lycées. 
Types of Secondary Schools in England.—Due to a 
variety of factors represented in social and economic 
conditions, to varying linguistic practices, to certain 
factors of church and of state and to private and 
proprietary interests in the establishment of schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  168 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
themselves, it is somewhat difficult to classify satis- 
factorily the secondary schools of England. Es- 
pecially was this true up to as late as 1902, at which 
time an effort was made to organize secondary schools 
more efficiently. 
The grammar schools, and the early Great Public 
Schools of England are distinctly representative types. 
Colet’s School at St. Paul’s has already been referred 
to as an early model of the later grammar schools 
founded. During the fourteenth, fifteenth and six- 
teenth centuries such public schools as Winchester, 
Eton, Shrewsbury, Westminster, Rugby, Harrow and 
Charterhouse were founded. The exact dates of their 
origin can be found in special historical treatises on 
these schools. It is a noteworthy fact that prominent 
personages were connected with these early schools, 
as, for example, Wykeham with Winchester, Henry VI 
with the founding of Eton and with Rugby, as head 
master, Thomas Arnold, who was prominent in his 
attitude toward the modification of the classical em- 
phasis. For purposes of the present discussion, how- 
ever, it is sufficient to call attention to the fact, in 
connection with the founding of hundreds of grammar 
schools during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward 
VI, and, in connection with the establishment of the 
first great public schools and those following, that the 
chief nature of the subject matter offered and taught 
in these schools was classical. 
Many of the schools established later have become 
somewhat modernized through the introduction of 
science and the other newer subjects. The continua- 
tion and vocational schools have been developed con-
-P-A-G-E-191
    
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 169 
siderably during the last quarter of a century. But 
all in all, the classical aspect is the most dominantly 
represented of all, even at the present time. 
Definition and Characterization of Secondary Schools 
in Terms of Subjects Taught—It has been customary 
at times, both in Europe and in America, to define 
the scope of secondary education in terms of the 
subjects offered. As early as the year 1802, France 
by law defined secondary education, as offered in 
communal districts, in terms of the subjects taught. 
Schools which taught Latin, French, mathematics, 
principles of geography and history were regarded as 
secondary. In Germany, it was necessary that at least 
two foreign languages, mathematics, science, geog- 
raphy, history and German literature be taught in a 
school if it was to receive a higher rank than primary. 
In the early part of the 1900’s, England defined second- 
ary education as that given in a school which offered 
work in subjects of a wider scope and higher grade 
than that of an elementary school, and which extended 
in its range at least to pupils of from twelve or thirteen 
to sixteen or seventeen years of age. The Education 
Act of 1902 stated a definition of grant-aided schools 
in substance as above, making obligatory such subjects 
as English language and literature, geography, his- 
tory, mathematics and one foreign language. When- 
ever a curriculum included two languages other than 
English, but in no way provided for Latin instruction, 
the Board of Education would not approve it unless 
satisfied that the omission of Latin was of advantage 
to the school involved. The above practices raise the 
question as to whether the province of secondary edu-  
-P-A-G-E-192
ee RC Tee Ce Sn ER ES EW TY See Ot pe a eae TOIT et ERT SOE Em 
170 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
cation can be characterized wholly in terms of subjects. 
Both implicitly and explicitly this will be referred to 
again in the discussion of secondary education in 
America. 
Higher Schools for Girls in European Countries.— 
As previously stated, coeducation in general exists 
only in the elementary schools: of Europe. In the 
higher schools, girls and boys are educated separately. 
In France, lycées and colleges for girls were originally 
established in 1880. The course, five years in length, 
is now divided into departments, of three years and 
two years respectively, being two years shorter than 
the boys’ course. A significant variation in the con- 
tent of courses, as contrasted with the program of 
studies for boys, appears in the absence of the domi- 
nant classical influence. Ethics, modern languages and 
literature, natural sciences and mathematics and the 
modern practical and fine arts are the chief subjects 
pursued. 
In Prussia, secondary education for girls developed 
more tardily than in France. The present organiza- 
tion had its beginning in 1908. Some modifications 
were later made in conformity with the ministerial 
order of 1912. At first there was a course for girls 
from six to sixteen years of age, known as the lyzeum. 
A bifurcated course was offered in an oberlyzeum. 
One aspect included work in household arts, the other, 
work in teacher-training, the first being two years in 
length and the second, four years. It is possible also 
to prepare for the university through a third course. 
The program of studies offered in the girls’ higher 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 171 
schools, as was true also in France, is more modern 
than in the boys’ schools. Propaganda was carried 
on by an ‘‘Association for the Secondary Education of 
Girls’’ for about three decades before anything was 
effectively begun. 
Secondary education of girls in England baad 
under private auspices and through private initiative 
during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The 
Girls’ Public Day School Company was responsible 
for the establishment of more than a score of schools. 
About the middle of the nineteenth century the educa- 
tion of girls in the secondary schools was agitated. 
Opposition to the education of girls was not so strong 
as in Germany. The Schools Inquiry Commissions 
(1867 and 1869) discussed this problem. A woman 
named Davies published an influential article arguing 
that boys and girls should have an equal opportunity. 
In 1875, a part of the appropriation for the Bradford 
Grammar School was specifically to be used for the 
education of girls. From 1896 to 1902 many middle 
secondary schools were established in towns of a pop- 
ulation of ten thousand and above. Since 1902 grants 
from the Board of Education have been given for hun- 
dreds of girls’ secondary schools. In the modern 
girls’ school, work is offered in such practical arts as 
domestic science, needle work, household hygiene and 
so forth. 
The Training of Secondary School Teachers.—In 
Germany and France teaching is dignified by being 
regarded as on a par with other professions. This is 
also true, in part, in England. Teachers in Prussia 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  172 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
are state employees. Their tenure of office is long. 
Their academic and professional training is of a high 
order. Upon graduating from a nine-year secondary 
school, they are required to spend six semesters in 
study at a university, pass examinations in at least 
two subjects to be taught in addition to philosophy, 
education, and religion, spend a year in observation 
and practice (seminarjahr), and a year in trial teach- 
ing work (probejahr). 
It is also possible to maintain high standards of 
teaching in the secondary schools of France because 
of the esteem in which the profession is held and be- 
cause of the probable long tenure of office. Thorough 
academic and professional training is demanded. A 
bachelor’s degree from a secondary school is required, 
including several years of training in a higher normal 
school or university. This entitles the individual to 
take an examination for the title of agregé, which has 
taken three or four years of additional time. This six 
years of training beyond the graduation point from the 
secondary school is a considerable guarantee of the 
mastery of subject matter as well as mastery of 
the method of presentation on the part of teachers 
with the inducement of a life-time profession before 
them. France is thus able to secure an adequately 
and splendidly equipped body of efficient men in its 
schools. 
In England, the tenure of office for headmasters of 
secondary schools is long. The training of teachers is 
more efficiently planned now than was true during the 
nineteenth century. However, the standards of or- 
ganization and administration of teacher-training in
-P-A-G-E-195
  
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 173 
England, academically and professionally considered, 
are considerably below the similar standards of Ger- 
many and France. 
General Résumé of Reform Tendencies 
In all three of the European countries above dis- 
cussed, the most progressive reorganization of sec- 
ondary education has occurred during the nineties of 
the nineteenth century and since that time. In 
Prussia, an important conference was held in 1890 
which several years later resulted in a revision of 
the programs of study and the recognition of the 
humanistic and realistic schools on a parity. In 
France, in 1902, legislation was passed giving prac- 
tically equal recognition to the linguistic, or humanis- 
tic, and to the scientific aspects of the curriculum, or 
to the courses in letters and science respectively. In 
England the reorganization of secondary schools is a 
long story. As early as the period from 1818 to 1837 
the Brougham Commission was appointed with power 
to investigate the status of secondary schools. In 
1864, the Taunton Commission, in its investigation of 
the endowed grammar schools, reported that provision 
for secondary schools among the middle and laboring 
classes was very deficient. The Bryce Commission of 
1894-1895, and others, led up to the Education Act of 
1902 which resulted in the reorganization of secondary 
education in England. As will be seen later on, re- 
organization of secondary education in America, too, 
had its beginning in the nineties. 
As to the modifications which have occurred during 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
  174 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the last decade or more it may be said that there have 
been comparatively few radical departures. Germany 
and France are still maintaining many of their tra- 
ditional practices that were in vogue previous to the 
World War. Continuation schools have multiplied in 
Germany as well as in England. France has changed 
her policy several times, back and forth, from an em- 
phasis upon the traditionally classical content to an 
emphasis upon the modern scientific content. In gen- 
eral, it may be said that curricula in some of the Euro- 
pean secondary schools have become modernized. A 
comparative study of current conditions since the 
World War would be of value in terms of reorganized 
secondary education. Certain tendencies and prob- 
lems remained persistently throughout the nineteenth 
century, and have been carried over into the twentieth 
century. The influence of social ideals and of eco- 
nomic conditions upon school organization is as ap- 
parent now as ever before. The conflict between the 
humanistic and the realistic contents of curricula is 
also evident. The problem of the relative place of the 
elective principle with reference to choice of studies 
by pupils in Germany, France and England receives 
varying emphases. The general policy and practice 
of having a separate elementary and secondary school 
system remains now about the same. The problem of 
devising secondary school objectives, additional to the 
more limited traditional ones of the past, including 
preparation for the university, has not yet really been 
begun in Europe. The high standards in case of 
teacher training are being maintained, and in most
-P-A-G-E-197
  
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 175 
respects are worthy of imitation by the American 
system.

CHAPTER X 
A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE EARLY GRAM- 
MAR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES OF 
AMERICA 
Introduction.—Three phases or periods are repre- 
sented in the historical development of secondary 
schools in America, namely, the grammar school, the 
academy and the public high school. Chronologically 
considered, the first phase includes the colonial period. 
The second begins during the latter part of the eight- 
eenth and continues for a century. The third begins 
in the first part of the nineteenth century. The pres- 
ent chapter includes only the first two phases. Pre- 
viously, it was suggested that the social ideals of 
Europe influenced very definitely the nature of the 
organization of their schools. This has likewise been 
true in the three chief types of secondary education in 
America. Necessarily, the discussion of this chapter 
must follow somewhat the order followed by most pre- 
vious writers who have dealt with the history of early 
American secondary education. 
The General Nature and Development of Grammar 
Schools 
European Influence.—The Latin grammar school as 
a type has a long history, beginning within the rhe- 
7
-P-A-G-E-200
  178 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
torical schools of the Greeks, assuming the form of the 
grammar school among the Romans later on and com- 
ing into great prominence in Europe during the 
Renaissance and the Reformation. In England, the 
grammar schools were established in largest numbers 
during the Renaissance, and were inherited from the 
grammar school organization of the Middle Ages. 
The primary purpose of Latin grammar schools in 
England was preparation for the university, and the 
content of subject matter studied was chiefly classical. 
The seventeenth century in American education is 
known as the period of transplantation of schools. 
During this period the grammar schools of England 
served as the prototypes of the early grammar schools 
established in America. Little change, if any, was 
made in the primary purpose and nature of the curric- 
ulum of American grammar schools as compared with 
those of England. In most instances the social, po- 
litical and religious ideals were transferred bodily 
from England. In some of the American states the 
more selective and aristocratic phase of education at 
first predominated. It has been previously remarked 
that the social and economic ideals of Europe led to an 
aristocratic type of secondary education. A detailed 
study of the school system of England will show that 
this was especially true there. Comparatively speak- 
ing, only the favored few have been enabled to com- 
plete the work in secondary education. 
This became, likewise, very largely true, during the 
early Colonial period, of the grammar school in Amer- 
ica. And the American practice was largely the result 
of the attempt to imitate slavishly the practices in 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  
  GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES 179 
England, or of the tendency to carry over bodily Eng- 
lish ideals to American soil. Little effort was made 
through reflective analysis to adjust the organization 
of the schools to the new environments and problems 
in America. In this respect, then, the Colonial period 
may be characterized as the imitative-traditionalis- 
tic, pseudo-progressive period. Or again, it may be 
thought of as the conserving, integrating stage of 
American secondary education. Naturally such an 
attitude of conservation did lead to keeping intact 
most of the traditional programs of study which 
seemed to the colonists to express a common body of 
knowledge regarded by them as sacred and essential. 
Relatively few of the early colonies made any serious 
attempts to reorganize their educational policies, or to 
establish schools intimately and vitally related to the 
actual problems and needs encountered in their every- 
day living. 
Typical Early Grammar Schools of America.—The 
early attempts to establish grammar schools were 
fraught with many difficulties. An instance appears 
in the case of the Virginia Company of London in 
1621. The chief causes of failure in this case were 
lack of financial support and the occurrences of the 
Indian massacre in 1622. Other unsuccessful attempts 
were also made to organize schools. The establish- 
ment of the Boston Latin School in 1635 supposedly 
marks the real beginning of secondary education in 
America. It is not easy to check up the authenticity 
of all of the items reported concerning this school. 
For present purposes, it is sufficient to call attention 
to the facts that it was supported and controlled by 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  180 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the town, that its primary aim was to prepare boys 
for college and that the nature of the curriculum was 
almost wholly humanistic in content. This ultra- 
classical course remained in vogue in this school un- 
til the first quarter of the nineteenth century, at which 
time certain aspects of English and history were in- 
troduced. Certain other grammar schools which had 
remained in existence after the middle of the seven- 
teenth century had modified the humanistic nature of 
their curricula to some extent. During the ten years 
following the establishment of the Boston Latin Gram- 
‘mar School, other Latin Grammar schools were be- 
gun in the New England towns of Charlestown, Salem, 
Dorchester, New Haven, Hartford, Cambridge. 
Early Legislative Action.—During the seventeenth 
century, many grammar schools were established in 
the larger towas in Massachusetts as well as in the 
other Colonies of Connecticut, Rhode Island, New 
York, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and here and there 
in the remaining colonies. The early personal expe- 
riences and training in England of the fathers of the 
Colonies had a large influence in determining the 
ideals, policies and organization of the early grammar 
schools of America. 
After the establishment of Harvard College had 
been outlined, and during the early forties, some pre- 
liminary legislation pertaining to education was en- 
acted in Massachusetts. Perhaps the most important 
enactment, one made in 1642, insisted upon education 
for the sake of religion and the commonwealth in gen- 
eral. The most distinctive and comprehensive early 
legislation was passed in Massachusetts in 1647. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  
  GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES 181 
law provided that an elementary school should be pro- 
vided for every fifty families, and a grammar or sec- 
ondary school for every 100 families. It is a note- 
worthy fact that, at that time, elementary and 
secondary education in America were not related as 
integral parts of one unified system. Consequently, a 
good many of the earlier grammar schools, as was true 
in England, had preparatory schools attached to them. 
The functional relation between elementary and sec- 
ondary education is one of the outstanding modern 
problems of organization and administration. 
The influence of the legislation of 1647 may be re- 
garded, in most respects, as the chief factor in the 
establishment of the Massachusetts school system. 
As is often true, however, the legal requirement and 
the real social demand for this added number of gram- 
mar schools were not consistent. The aim of these 
schools as stated by law was preparation for college, 
and boys only attended them. Consequently, the in- 
creased number of schools required by law was larger 
than the number actually needed to educate all of the 
boys available. Naturally, considerable opposition 
was made to the law by many persons. Those persons 
whose sons expected to attend college naturally fa- 
vored grammar schools, and those persons whose sons 
did not intend to go to college held the opposite atti- 
tude. Nevertheless, while the actual requirement 
made through this legislation was considerably be- 
yond the social need, still, through the partial realiza- 
tion of the law, certain policies, principles and prob- 
lems of secondary education were initiated. 
The dominance of higher education over secondary  
-P-A-G-E-204
182 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
was manifest in the nature of the aim and in the nature 
of the subject matter taught in the grammar schools 
of the seventeenth century, and in those of the eight- 
eenth. This influence was definitely apparent in the 
entrance requirements outlined by Harvard College 
and the College of William and Mary. The requiring 
Latin and Greek as entrance subjects by the only 
American colleges then in existence inevitably meant 
that these subjects must be studied in the grammar 
school. 
Hundreds of grammar schools were established in 
the colonies both before and after the enactment of the 
law of 1647 in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts 
alone, approximately thirty were established before 
1750, and about a dozen more were organized in Con- 
necticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. These 
schools performed a definite service to the church and 
the state/ Due to their simplicity of purpose, the na- 
ture of their organization was highly simplified. As 
colonial conditions began to be more complex, the 
grammar schools failed to readjust themselves fully 
to the social, occupational and professional needs of 
the people. A somewhat less general limitation lay 
in the fact that no provision was made for the educa- 
tion of girls. The decline of the prominence of gram- 
mar schools began during the first part of the 
eighteenth century, since it was impossible for an 
aristocratic-like régime begun in the midst of seven- 
teenth century conditions to function successfully in 
the midst of the new social, industrial and economic 
situations of the eighteenth century. What are char- 
acterized today as social studies and school activities

  GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES 183 
were wholly lacking in the grammar schools of the 
Colonial period—the very soil in which a modern 
school, based upon industries as was Dewey’s Hle- 
mentary School, might have flourished. 
The General Nature and Development of the 
Academies 
The Academy Movement in England.—Queen Eliza- 
beth’s academy was established in 1572, and was one 
of the first of its kind in England. The training of- 
fered in it was intended primarily for the nobility 
and courtly gentlemen. Important modifications took 
place later on. Modern languages were emphasized 
rather than ancient. Mathematics, certain aspects of 
the now so-called social sciences, government, manage- 
ment of states and public affairs, as well as natural 
sciences, were studied. 
In 1662, thousands of clergymen, regarded as non- 
conformists according to the Act of Uniformity, were 
driven out of their parishes. Previous to this time, 
many clergymen had been educated in the grammar 
schools and the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford. 
It became necessary to establish academies to educate 
and to prepare persons for the ministry and for other 
professions, so that writers have sometimes spoken of 
the rise of English academies as the outgrowth of re- 
ligious non-conformity. After the Toleration Act was 
passed in 1689, twenty-five or thirty academies were 
established before the time of the American Rey- 
olution. 
John Milton (1608-1674), in his Tractate of Educa-  
-P-A-G-E-206
  184 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tion, expressed his views relative to the organization 
of an institution to be known as the ‘‘Academy,’’ which 
he recommended should be established in every city. 
Milton, though a classicist, opposed the usual formalis- 
tic education of his own day because of its emptiness 
and its emphasis upon mere words. He outlined ac- 
cordingly a plan of education for boys from twelve to 
twenty-one years of age. In his program of studies 
the content of Latin and Greek literature was to 
be emphasized rather than the mere formal study of 
these languages. To these ancient classics were to be 
added the study of arithmetic, geometry, physiology, 
agriculture, geography, architecture, natural science, 
ethics, economics, politics, history, logic, rhetoric, 
oratory, ,church history and so forth. His plan of 
studies in many respects was too encyclopedic and 
comprehensive to be practicable. Nevertheless, the 
non-humanistic aspects and those phases which em- 
phasized a study of the activities of people were in- 
fluential in determining the nature of the content 
taught in academies established later. The academy 
at Rathmill was established in 1665. The chief pur- 
pose of these earlier academies in England was to fit 
persons for the ministry. And while they emphasized 
the ancient classics, they did also include the study of 
mathematics, natural and social sciences and modern 
languages. 
The influence of the academy movement in England 
was not so directly and strongly felt by the academies 
established in America as was that of the imported 
Latin grammar school of England. The realistic na- 
ture of studies, or the adaptation of studies to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES 185 
social needs of the people, was an element to be found 
in common, however, in both countries in the estab- 
lishment of academies. The Tractate on Education 
by Milton, and Defoe’s Essay upon Projects may have 
had some influence upon Franklin and others, in their 
idea of the establishment of American academies. 
The origin of the word ‘‘academy’’ may also have been 
influenced by such men as the Mathers, Jonathan Hd- 
wards and Whitefield, in both the English and Ameri- 
can setting. 
Transition from the Latin Grammar School to the 
Academy.—A fundamental modern tenet, widely ac- 
cepted, is that schools are institutions which should 
meet the social needs of people. In case these needs 
are changed, it is obligatory upon established schools 
to reorganize and make readjustments which will con- 
form to the changing needs of society. The Latin 
grammar school of America had been developed under 
a strong ecclesiastical and aristocratic influence. En- 
vironmental conditions were simple. Later, New Eng- 
land life grew more and more complex as the indus- 
trial, merchant and trade groups increased in number. 
Again, the early beginning of the significant westward — 
movement and the gradual change of methods of 
transportation tended to break up previous traditions 
and customs. The Latin grammar school was not flex- 
ible enough as an institution to survive. The acad- 
emy was born, therefore, in the midst of the social and 
economic changes that occurred during the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries. This situation serves his- 
torically as one of the best illustrations of the need of 
interrelations between secondary schools and the life
-P-A-G-E-208
  186 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of the people whom they presume to serve and save. 
First American Academy.—Franklin outlined the 
plan for the first American Academy in 1743, but, be- 
cause of the lack of support of his idea by others, its 
actual organization was delayed until 1751. His pub- 
lication entitled Proposals Relating to the Education 
of Youth in Pennsylvania was widely distributed and 
received with favor by a number of philanthropic- 
minded citizens of Philadelphia, and it led to financial 
support sufficient to establish the Academy. 
In the program of studies recommended by Frank- 
lin, English was emphasized most. But the Academy 
was later organized into three so-called schools, Eng- 
lish, Latin and Mathematical. Franklin’s Sketch of 
an English School called for six classes, or, years of 
work. The entrance requirement consisted of the abil- 
ity of the pupil to read and write. In the lowest class 
short stories, orthography and rules of English gram- 
mar were to be studied, with emphasis upon the mean- 
ing of words and oral reading. In the second class, 
such material as the Spectator, selections from plays, 
speeches and letters was to be used. In the third, 
rhetoric and practice of speaking, together with the 
reading of history, including natural and mechanical 
history, was to appear. In the fourth, special em- 
phasis was to be given to composition, including the 
study of model letters. In the fifth, the writing of 
essays in prose and poetry was to be studied. This 
year’s work was also to include the reading of John- 
son’s First Principles of Human Knowledge. In the 
sixth, a study was to be made of the best English au- 
thors, of the best papers in the Spectator or Guardian,
-P-A-G-E-209
  GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES 187 
of the choicest translations of Homer, Virgil, Horace 
and Travels of Cyrus and so forth. 
With reference to the studies as a whole in the three 
schools, the emphasis was placed upon the most useful 
subjects. Penmanship, drawing, arithmetic, the Eng- 
lish language, history in conjunction with geography, 
chronology, ancient customs, civil government, agri- 
culture, horticulture, commerce, industry, mechanics 
and the optional study of foreign languages represent 
a realistic type of program of studies as contrasted 
with the humanistic tradition that was still expressing 
itself strongly both in England and America when 
Franklin’s school was established. 
Franklin’s Academy did not become an outstanding 
model for later academies in America to the extent 
that Sturm’s Gymnasium, or Colet’s School in Eng- 
land, for example, did for gymnasia and grammar 
schools respectively. Other early academies varied 
from the Franklin type in some respects, but his Acad- 
emy did represent the tendency of realism to enter into 
American secondary education. 
The Later Academy Movement in America.—The 
beginning of the later academy movement in America 
occurred during the latter part of the eighteenth cen- 
tury. As was true in the Latin grammar school move- 
ment, so in the case of the academy, Massachusetts 
led the way. After the earliest academies had been 
established in the Middle Colonies, the movement 
shifted to New England. 
In 1761, upon the death of Lieutenant-Governor 
William Dummer of Massachusetts, his property was 
used for the establishment of a grammar school at
-P-A-G-E-210
  188 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Newbury. In 1782 it became known as the Dummer 
Academy. Only a limited amount of authentic ma- 
terial is published concerning this school, but it seems 
justifiable to assume that it represented a significant 
connecting link between the grammar school and the 
academy movement, owing to its newer emphasis upon 
realistic versus humanistic content, and its control and 
support by private beneficence rather than by the local 
public, as in the case of the grammar school. 
Two other academies established about this same 
time, however, became the types or models for many of 
the academies founded during the next century. One 
of these was located at Andover, Massachusetts, in 
1778, and the other at Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1781. 
The Latin grammar school had declined in the latter 
part of the eighteenth century, so that, from the last 
part of the eighteenth century to about the middle of 
the nineteenth century, academies represent the pre- 
vailing type of secondary education in America. In 
at least three respects these two earlier academies an- 
ticipated the policies and practices of later institutions. 
In the first place, control and support were private and 
quasi-public combined, or even, here and there, private 
and semi-public combined. In the second place, the 
purpose or aim of the school, although it included an 
opportunity to prepare for college, was, primarily, to 
prepare for the business of living. In the third place, 
the range of curricular offerings was increased beyond 
that of the grammar school. 
In addition to increasing the range of subjects so as 
to include, by the end of the first of the nineteenth 
century, the classical and English departments, some
-P-A-G-E-211
  GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES 189 
academies offered work also in teacher-training. Fur- 
thermore, secondary education for girls was for the 
first time made available. Sometimes this was offered 
in separate girls’ academies, and in other instances 
the work was coeducational. 
The Development of Academies into Higher Institu- 
tions of Learning—Some of the earlier academies 
developed into higher institutions of learning. In 
some instances, they became colleges or universities. 
The earliest example of this tendency was the reor- 
ganization of Franklin’s Academy, in 1799, into the 
University of Pennsylvania. In some cases the acad- 
emies developed into normal schools, and here and 
there they became high schools. In other cases it 
was customary for the academies, while intact, to offer 
subjects of college rank. Most of the earlier acad- 
emies of the eighteenth century were regarded as 
finishing schools somewhat akin to the lycées of 
France. The later academies became directly at- 
tached to the higher institutions of learning. This 
was often especially true in the case of the private 
colleges where the number of pupils was not large 
enough to maintain an institution giving four years of 
college work. In such instances, academies became 
preparatory schools attached to colleges located in 
proximity or on the same campus. To quote H. E. 
Brown: ‘‘In the latter part of the nineteenth century 
when high schools had largely taken the place of acad- 
emies as the ordinary agency of secondary education, 
the academies swung back toward the position of dis- 
tinctively preparatory institutions.’’ 
Expansiveness of the Movement.—As is always con-
-P-A-G-E-212
  190 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ceded, academies multiplied at first more rapidly in 
Massachusetts than in any other one state. The de- 
velopment was almost phenomenal in New England as 
a whole, considering it as a conscious attempt to ad- 
just secondary education to a new set of increasingly 
complex conditions, including social conditions, colored 
by a growing national and democratic spirit. By the 
beginning of the nineteenth century, almost a score of 
institutions of the newer type had been incorporated 
in Massachusetts alone. The most rapid period of 
development occurred just after the first quarter of 
the nineteenth century. From Massachusetts the 
movement spread into New York, Pennsylvania, Mary- 
land, Virginia and other states. In New England as 
a whole, by 1830, approximately 150 existed, and by 
1850, approximately 1,000. 
The Academy as a Forerunner of Democratic Sec- 
ondary Education.—Both psychological and sociolog- 
ical selection of individual pupils and of groups of 
pupils were characteristic of the secondary schools of 
Europe as well as of the original secondary education 
in America. The academy substituted a primarily 
democratic ideal for an aristocratic one. The spell 
of the domination of college entrance was broken up 
in part. The groundwork for a more universal sec- 
ondary education was laid. Consciousness of the 
need of adjusting school policies to the social needs 
of the people through offering a wider range of stud- 
ies was developed. The idea of universal education 
carried to its logical conclusion meant that girls as 
well as boys were entitled to the opportunities of sec- 
ondary education. A small beginning was made in 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES 191 
the meager attempts to carry on semi-professional 
teacher-training in the academies. Here and there, 
state legislatures did make provision for grants of 
land for school support, and in this way recognized 
the academy as a part of the American public school 
system. The religious motives and ideals which ac- 
companied the academy movement were broader and 
less puritanical than those of the early days of the 
Colonial grammar schools. Education for social serv- 
ice and leadership was realized in a comparatively 
large way through these institutions. The aristocratic 
class, the middle class and the common people, so far 
as such distinctions were consciously made, were all 
given an increased opportunity for secondary educa- 
tion in terms of humanistic, realistic and social studies.

CHAPTER XI 
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AMERICAN HIGH 
SCHOOL DURING THE NINETEENTH 
CENTURY 
Introduction.—The development of the non-demo- 
cratic Latin grammar schools, and of the semi- 
democratic academies respectively, had prepared the 
way, both negatively and positively, for the inception 
of the American high school, through which secondary 
education became universal. The American high 
school in its turn became, therefore, the chief represen- 
tative democratic institution of secondary education 
during the nineteenth century. 
By the end of the second quarter of the nineteenth 
century environmental conditions had changed very 
much. In Europe the problem of the inequality of 
individuals had been discussed. Rousseau in the 
eighteenth century had reflected conditions in France 
in his treatises entitled Social Control and The Origin 
of the Inequality among Men. The outcome of the 
American Revolution had created a spirit of inde- 
pendence of the mother country on the part of the 
American Colonists. The American national ideal 
had become prominent. International relations with 
European countries had been consciously discussed. 
The War of 1812 had compelled America during the 
first quarter of the century to increase its manu- 
193

  194 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
factured products because of temporarily blocked rela- 
tions with other countries. The Monroe Doctrine had 
been established. New modes of travel and changed 
means of communication were in operation and sig- 
nificant inventions affecting industrial practices had 
taken place. Under these conditions new points of 
contact and new social relationships between the select 
classes and the masses inevitably resulted. Aristo- 
cratic ideals of Colonial days and semi-democratic 
ideals of Revolutionary days could not remain without 
modification in these new situations. An increased 
number of school subjects was necessary to express 
cross-sections of these complex conditions in the midst 
of an expanding and inclusive concept of nationalism. 
The first twenty years or more after the first high 
school was organized may, therefore, be quite justifi- 
ably characterized as an experimental stage. 
The Establishment and Stabilization of the High 
School from 1821 to 1892 
The Origin of the Boston Classical School for Boys. 
—According to some writers the phrase ‘‘high school’’ 
was borrowed from the Edinburgh High School, Scot- 
land, which John Griscom had described in a document 
published in 1820, According to other authorities this 
statement is debatable. A system of primary schools 
was established in the city of Boston during the first 
quarter of the nineteenth century, in 1818. About the 
same time, efforts had been begun to enlarge the edu- 
cational facilities for pupils wanting to continue with 
their secondary school work. Boston had been made a  
-P-A-G-E-217

city in May, 1822. The records show that the mayor 
from 1823 to 1828 had taken an interest in the earlier 
efforts of the committees which had attempted to out- 
line a plan whereby it would be possible to provide 
schools for pupils representing the merchant and 
tradesman classes. After about a year’s discussion 
by a school committee, and its later sub-committee, it 
was recommended that a school be established. In 
harmony with the recommendation made, the English 
Classical School was opened in 1821. In 1824 the name 
of the school was changed to English High School. In 
1832 the legality of this procedure was questioned and 
the original name was restored. But in 1833, it was 
again given the name ‘‘English High School.’’ 
‘~ Two reasons for the establishment of the school were 
k given. In the first place, it was suggested that those 
”/ boys who were not planning to pursue later the class- 
ical types of studies in college should have an oppor- 
tunity to prepare for the active duties of life of a mer- 
eantile and commercial, as well as of a mechanical, 
nature. The committees whose business it was to 
study the matter were asked by certain individuals to 
consider the preparation of boys for mercantile, cler- 
ical, legal and journalistic careers, as well as for later 
college stud {)In the second place, many persons in- 
sisted oa. supported high schools in order 
that citizens might be relieved of the expenses involved 
in the support of private academies. 
One evidence that the academy was in reality a fore- 
runner of the high school is to be found in the fact that 
certain of the newer subjects studied in the academy 
were also re-emphasized and carried over into the high    
-P-A-G-E-218
  196 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
school. In observance of the three-year course of 
study first introduced, it will be noted that compo- 
_Sition, language and grammar, geography and arith- 
metic appear in the first year; composition, reading, 
declamation, forensics, history, mathematics, naviga- 
tion and surveying, in the second; and composition, dec- 
lamation, mathematics, logic, history, natural philos- 
ophy, moral philosophy and political philosophy, in 
the third year. 
Apparently, the standards for the first three or four 
decades or more were rather rigid. When the school 
was begun, less than 100 boys were admitted after hav- 
ing met satisfactorily the qualifications, one of which 
was to be twelve years of age, while another was to be 
able to pass a strict examination in reading, writing, 
English grammar and arithmetic as far as simple pro- 
portion. About 1840 the enrollment was only a little 
above 100, and in 1865, a few over 200. 
In the light of the fact that the term ‘‘Classical’’ 
was used to describe the first high school for boys, the 
absence of foreign language is noticeable. On the 
contrary, three years of English and three years of 
mathematics, together with geography and history, 
represent a realistic phase or tendency. Such subjects 
as natural, moral and political philosophy and logic 
indicate that the influence of college curricula was in 
evidence, and that the high school had as yet been able 
only partially to readjust its subject matter to actual 
social needs of pupils. The revised course of 1852 in- 
cluded modern foreign languages as well as most of 
the subjects offered in 1821, with the addition of even 
a larger proportion of so-called practical subjects.
-P-A-G-E-219
    THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 197 
Jefferson’s View in 1779.—In the State of Virginia, 
selective and aristocratic education had been borrowed 
directly from England. The earlier private second- 
ary schools of Virginia, endowed with bequests of land 
and money, resembled the endowed Latin schools of 
England. In 1779, however, Jefferson presented to 
the legislature a plan of universal education. Dis- 
tricts called ‘‘hundreds’’ in the counties were to sup- 
port elementary schools for three years. An outstand- 
ing pupil was to be selected from each school and sent 
to a grammar school for a trial of two years, and then, 
if promising, given the full six-year secondary school 
course. Indirectly, this probably influenced school 
legislation in Virginia during the first part of the nine- 
teenth century, but Jefferson’s plan was never adopted 
as such. 
High School for Girls.—Indirectly at least, the acad- 
emy movement had prepared the way for the public 
secondary education of girls. A school committee or- 
ganized for the purpose of considering the possibility 
of providing high school education for girls reported 
in_1825. On the strength of this report and recom- 
mendation, a school was organized in Boston in 1826. 
The system of ‘‘monitorial or mutual instruction’? was 
used. The subjects outlined were similar in nature, 
in many respects, to those offered in the boys’ high 
school. More girls applied for entrance than could be 
accommodated. Partly because of the lack of sufficient 
financial support, the school was discontinued after its 
first two years of existence. In 1847, plans were con- 
sidered for its re-establishment. In 1854 these plans 
were finally consummated, and the school, which had 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  198 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
for a short time been organized as a normal school, 
was re-established as a girls’ high school. 
Three General Influential Factors.—The high school 
movement in general was due to a number of factors 
in addition to the general demand that new social needs 
and conditions be met. One of these was the Lancaster 
and Bell movement in England and in America to re- 
duce the cost or expense of private education. An- 
other was found in the semi-public support of the 
academy, resulting in the origin of a number of free 
academies. A third factor was the tendency to in- 
crease the size of the smaller school districts into 
larger units, especially in the instance of cities. 
Massachusetts in the Vanguard in the High School 
Movement.—The first high school of Boston is not to 
be regarded as the sole type or model of later high 
schools organized, though it did contribute to the later 
schools to a relatively large degree by trying out the 
enlarged purposes and expanding courses of study. 
A law pertaining to the establishment of high schools 
in Massachusetts, comparable in some respects to the 
law of 1647 pertaining to grammar schools, was passed 
in 1827. This law made provision for the teaching 
of certain high school subjects such as history, book- 
keeping, algebra, geometry and surveying, in com- 
munities having 500 families or householders. In 
larger communities having 4,000 inhabitants, such ad- 
ditional subjects as Latin, Greek, advanced history, 
rhetoric and logic were to be offered. As is obvious, 
two grades of high schools were defined. Previous to 
this law of 1827, a few schools had been organized. 
For several decades following its enactment towns of

Massachusetts and other states were allowed consider- 
able freedom to organize schools to their liking in their 
respective communities. Some of the factors affecting 
the growth of high schools during these few decades 
were increased population of towns, reorganization of 
the size of districts, and changed economic and indus- 
trial conditions. The establishment of high schools in 
the towns of Plymouth, Salem, Springfield and Lowell 
involved the factors above mentioned. For example, 
due to the rapid increase in the population of Salem, it 
was necessary to expand the work of the high school. 
In Lowell, there had been rapid economic development 
because of the demand for labor in the mills. By 1840, 
a score or more of high schools had been organized in 
Massachusetts alone. New Hampshire and Maine fol- 
lowed out in a less comprehensive way the policies of 
Massachusetts in modified form. The next quarter of 
a century in New England witnessed a great expansion 
of the high school movement. 
In summary then, the status of the American high 
school ten years before the middle of the nineteenth 
century was about as follows: The aim was to pro- 
vide for both the academic and non-academic or voca- 
tional groups of pupils, the primary emphasis of the 
English high school being preparation for practical 
life activities. The aim and content of the curriculum 
had been foreshadowed by the academy movement. 
Public support and control had been suggested by both 
the Latin grammar school and the free academies. 
The law of 1827 included the chief elements of the later 
standardized high school which followed largely the 
model set by Massachusetts. It is a noteworthy fact  
-P-A-G-E-222
  200 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
that while the influence of European schools was strong 
upon the grammar schools of the Colonial period, there 
is little evidence of foreign influence upon secondary 
education in the high schools of New England. There- 
fore, the democratic high school is almost purely an 
American institution. 
The High School outside New England during the 
Middle of the Century.—Near the middle of the nine- 
teenth century, a small group of large cities developed 
large centralized high schools. Some states, as, for 
example, Pennsylvania, had passed preliminary legis- 
lation as early as 1818. In 1838, under the Act of 
1836, the Central High School of Philadelphia was es- 
tablished. The development of this school at a time 
when the pauper school had recently been in existence, 
the guidance of the school under Alexander Bache, the 
two-year English-science course for students planning 
to enter business, the four-year English-science course, 
the four-year classical courses, and the later reorgani- 
zation into an institution known as a college authorized 
to grant degrees all represent some aspects of signifi- 
eant tendencies prevalent during the middle of the cen- 
tury. A detailed account of this school has been 
published in book form. 
Representative examples of other cities which estab- 
lished centralized high schools are the following: Bal- 
timore in 1839, Cleveland in 1846, Columbus in 1846, 
Cincinnati in 1849, Toledo in 1849, St. Louis in 1853, 
Chicago in 1856, and Detroit in 1858. Hstimates of the 
total number of high schools in existence in 1860 vary, 
according to different authorities, from forty to sixty- 
five or more. But, at any rate, it may be correctly
-P-A-G-E-223
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH.SCHOOL 201 
assumed that from the experimental policies, taking 
the country as a whole, there had developed, by this 
third quarter of the century, the major policies most 
desirable in an established system of high schools. 
A detailed study of the historical development of a 
dozen or more of the large city high schools would no 
doubt show that there were many common problems 
to be met and solved, and, furthermore, would fore- 
shadow many of our present-day problems. 
Source Statements Concerning the Development of 
Secondary ‘Education in Chicago 
The following discussion of secondary education in 
Chicago indicates some of the representative problems 
that had to be faced in specific situations and under 
local conditions. About the middle of the nineteenth 
century, public high schools in a limited number of the 
larger cities began to grow somewhat rapidly. By 
the last quarter of the nineteenth century, secondary 
education was well on the way to much more rapid 
development. Out of the list of representative large 
cities given above, Chicago has been chosen for dis- 
cussion in considerable detail. Other cities might well 
have been used as types of the Middle West. The 
discussion of the school situation in Chicago up to 1875 
is chiefly a description, in as accurate terms as possible, 
of representative secondary school problems. No at- 
tempt is made to evaluate in any final way the organi- 
zation and administration of the school system, except, 
here and there, in an incidental way, wherever the 
source statements throw light on the practical problems 
that were then faced by school officers. Many of these 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
202 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
source statements will appear in this discussion in 
the original form because it seemed to destroy the real 
setting of many of them to use a paraphrased form. 
Origin of Secondary Education in Chicago.—Public 
secondary education in Chicago had its beginning soon 
after the middle of the nineteenth century. The 
Chicago High School was opened for real work on 
October 8, 1856. At this time, the whole public school 
system of the city consisted of less than a dozen grade 
schools. The second annual report, published in 1855, 
states that, according to the returns, the number of 
pupils instructed in the schools during the year was 
6,826. There were nine schools in the city, and two 
besides the high school were to be added to this number 
during the ensuing year. 
Attitudes before 1856.—For more than a decade be- 
fore the Chicago High School was established there 
had been considerable agitation and discussion con- 
cerning the need of some sort of education beyond that 
offered in the primary and grammar schools of the city. 
The discussion began on the part of officials of the city 
in the early forties. The school system had been re- 
organized in 1840 after the granting of the first city 
charter in 1837. The schools at this time were under 
the control of a body of men called the Board of In- 
spectors, corresponding to the later Board of Educa- 
tion. 
In 1843 they said, ‘‘Had we means, the establish- 
ment of a High School with two good teachers, into 
which might be placed a hundred of the best instructed 
scholars from the different schools would remedy this 
increasing evil’’ of a crowded condition of the schools.
-P-A-G-E-225
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 203 
In 1844, the first public school building in Chicago, 
which was regarded as the highest piece of folly be- 
cause it was so large, was erected on Madison Street, 
between Dearborn and State Streets. At this time, 
they talked of using ‘‘the upper room to be so divided 
as to give necessary recitation rooms for a High 
School.’? In 1846, the inspectors again called atten- 
tion to the need of at least one school where the ordi- 
nary academic studies might be taught. On February 
7, 1847, in the quarterly report of the Committee on 
Schools, the School Inspector said: ‘‘In reference to 
a High School they are of the opinion that there are 
insuperable objections to the establishment of such a 
school, independent of the inability of the city at the 
present time to build one.’’ 
In 1852, a committee, appointed by the Board of 
Inspectors to investigate, reported to the City Council 
the following: ‘‘Your committee has long been aware 
that the system is yet incomplete. To our common 
schools should be added schools of a higher character.’’ 
“Wor the present your committee would recommend 
but one High School, to be located in a central part of 
the city, with all the proper appliances for educational 
purposes. The school Fund proper should not, of 
course, be appropriated to sustain a school of this 
character. Increased taxation would be a necessary 
consequence.’’ The relevancy of calling attention to 
the fact that this has been a problem of never-ending 
discussion in America is obvious. 
The first annual report of schools in 1854 read: 
‘The school houses have been repaired, and the Coun- 
cil called upon to make the requisite appropriations for
-P-A-G-E-226
  204 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the following purposes . . . To erect a school build- 
ing for the Institution of a High School commensurate 
with present wants and prospective growth of the City 
of Chicago.’? And on January 23, 1855, the Common 
Council. passed the following ordinance: ‘‘Be it or- 
dained by the Common Council of the city of Chicago, 
that for the improvement of the system of public 
schools now existing in this city, and the elevation of 
the Primary and Grammar Schools, a High School 
shall be established and a building for the same 
erected.’’ 
The date 1875 has been used as a nodal point in the 
development of the secondary education of Chicago, 
because with the exception of one year high school 
classes organized in the three different divisions of 
the city in 1869, early higher education centered about 
this central high school. From one aspect it is justi- 
fiable, therefore, to characterize this period up to 1875 
as the period of centralization. 
Housing Equipment.—A large section of the history 
of early high school education in Chicago is connected, 
in one way or another, with the nature of the buildings 
in the region of the original High School. Further- 
more, a part of the general history of high school archi- 
tecture during the nineteenth century may be observed 
by visiting the Chicago High School building, begun 
in 1855 and completed in 1856, and then visiting the 
old original West High School, now the Scammon 
School, observing the West High School, now the Uni- 
versity of Illinois School of Medicine, and lastly, ob- 
serving the McKinley High School, for example, or any 
other of the more recently erected high school build-
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 205 
ings in the city. Almost a complete history of high 
school structures is yet actually in concrete existence— 
the three-story stone building, together with the two- 
room frame one, on Monroe Street between Halsted 
and DesPlaines Streets, representing pioneer efforts 
of the city in the so-called higher education of both 
sexes. 
A school report makes the following statement: 
The first important event in the history of our public school 
system during the year 1855, was the passage of an ordinance by 
the Common Council for the establishment of a Public High School. 
The erection of a suitable building for its accommodation next be- 
came a subject of consideration, and after much deliberation with 
regard to building material and expense, it was resolved to erect 
a building of Athens stone, in the West division of the City, on 
Monroe Street, at an expense of thirty-three thousand and seventy 
dollars. 
The following description was given: 
The High School building contains nine school-rooms and a hall. 
Each school room contains forty seats for pupils. The hall, in 
ease of necessity can be occupied as a school-room, and thus fur- 
nish additional accommodations for forty scholars, which is quite 
as large a number of pupils of the attainments of those in the 
High School, as can properly be instructed by one teacher. Con- 
venient accommodations, therefore, for four hundred scholars can 
be furnished in the High School Building. 
There was also a room reserved for the library. 
But later in the sixties the condition was described as 
follows: 
In order to admit all the scholars who graduated from the 
Grammar Schools to seats in the High School, we had not only 
to convert the library into a schoolroom, but also to remove one  
-P-A-G-E-228
  206 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
elass to the Assembly Hall. . . . The crowded condition of the school 
in 1867-68 made it necessary to divide the Assembly Hall into 
two classrooms. 
The basement contained four furnaces. Hot air 
flues were built in the partitions. Ventilating flues 
were arranged for proper circulation of the air, warm 
and cold. Later on, it became necessary to use nine 
stoves for heating because the furnaces did not fur- 
nish sufficient heat, and after about ten years a new 
system was installed. In the words of a report: 
Stoves and furnaces have heretofore been used to heat the High 
School building. These have been displaced during the summer 
vacation, and an apparatus to heat by steam introduced. The 
change, though somewhat costly, seemed to be necessary. 
A few hundred dollars have been expended on the interior of 
the building in tinting the walls, graining some portions of the 
woodwork, varnishing and in making some much-needed alterations. 
For some time past our High School building has been somewhat 
unsightly, and it is a source of great gratitude that the dismal and 
rusty stoves and stove-pipes are at last removed, and that the walls 
of the rooms, and especially of the main hall, are made once more 
to look cheerful and clean. The only regret of your committee 
[committee on High School] in regard to these interior decora- 
tions, is that they make the grounds around the building look even 
more neglected and dreary than they did before. 
The High School edifice was completed in the sum- 
mer of 1856. The whole value of the building and the 
furniture was about $50,000. 
Physical Training Apparatus——Physical education 
today has come to claim such a large place in the field 
of secondary education that it is almost impossible to 
appreciate the sacrifices that were made to establish 
it only a little over a half century ago in a now busy
-P-A-G-E-229
    
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL = 207 
commercial city. As usual in the history of education, 
the provision was made for girls more tardily than 
for boys. From reports during the first half decade 
of the school’s history come the following statements, 
which reflect the attitude then manifested: 
Some have apprehended that the amount of study performed by 
pupils in High School was so, great, as in some instances, seriously 
to endanger their health. Such cases are rare, and I am not cer- 
tain that they have ever existed. Il] health is sometimes caused by 
excessive mental labor, but is often induced among students by 
neglect of the physiological laws relative to exercise, sleep and food. 
Indeed, mental labor seems no more incompatible with good health, 
than the various forms of physical toil. But the customs of 
society restrict the kind and amount of exercise taken by girls to 
such a degree, that their constitutions are often early impaired, 
and they are rendered incapable of any protracted study. A 
theoretical knowledge of the laws of physiology is of no real benefit 
unless they can be induced to apply them. 
With comparatively little expense, a gymnasium might be erected 
for the girls of the High School, and physical exercise might be- 
come a regular department in their education. The immediate 
benefit to them would be invaluable, and a correct appreciation of 
the importance of appropriate exercise might thus be diffused 
through the community. 
The means by which equipment for physical training 
was at first voluntarily provided is shown in the fol- 
lowing statements: 
During the year, the boys of the school erected, at their own 
expense, a gymnasium, at the cost of upwards of $100. Very bene- 
ficial results were soon apparent in the increased health and vigor 
of the boys, and in their appreciation of the utility of regular and 
appropriate exercise. The gymnasium was of necessity erected in 
the open air, and cannot be used except during the warm months. 
No facilities for physical exercise for girls yet exist. Our public  
-P-A-G-E-230
  208 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
schools provide, with commendable efficiency, for the development 
of the intellect, and with considerable and increasing success for a 
suitable cultivation of the moral nature, but physical education is 
almost entirely neglected, and is left to accident, and to occasional 
theoretical instruction in hygiene. There seems to be no inherent 
propriety in developing the moral and intellectual in children, and 
neglecting the cultivation of the physical, unless upon the assump- 
tion that the latter may safely be left to the care of the parents, 
and is likely to be provided for with special attention. Experience 
shows that such an assumption is fallacious... . If cheap frame 
buildings were erected in the yards belonging to the High School, 
the requisite apparatus would cheerfully be furnished by the parents 
of the pupils, and the necessary instruction could be given without 
additional expense. 
The problem of expense is clearly indicated in the 
above quotations. This remains up to the present 
time a prominent problem. In addition to this there 
were in the supervision of this physical work two 
problems: first the ability of the classroom teachers 
to do it, and secondly, the needed time for them to 
carry it out. i 
The reports further state: 
It has been said by some, that too much is required of pupils 
in our schools, especially of girls in the High School; that their 
lessons are too long and too hard: and this may be true in some 
instances; girls are less inclined than boys to engage in those 
youthful athletic sports which contribute so much to health and 
vigor; they also pass much more time within doors than boys, and 
consequently inhale more of the vitiated atmosphere of schoolrooms 
and dwelling houses. While, therefore, there may be just cause 
of complaint of lessons assigned them, considering their physical 
ability, there is reason to believe that their inability, or want of 
power of endurance and application, arises from a want of sufficient 
amount of the right kind of exercise in the open air. Hence, it 
appears not more important that their lessons, and the lessons of
-P-A-G-E-231
  THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 209 
all pupils of either sex and of any age, should be gauged to their 
capacity, than that some means should be adopted to increase their 
bodily vigor. 
One year ago, the Board of Education introduced an elaborate 
system of physical exercises into all the schools. Each of the differ- 
ent movements was described with such particularity that any 
teacher or school would be able to learn and execute it from the 
description alone. Besides the regular course of free gymnastics 
prescribed by the Board, the High School and several of the dis- 
trict schools have already been furnished suitable gymnastic appa- 
ratus for the use of the pupils by the liberality of parents, and other 
friends; and it is to be hoped that the remaining districts will soon 
be favored with similar facilities. 
An experiment has been tried during the past year, in several 
of the schools, with the bean-bag exercises recommended by Dr. 
Lewis of Boston: but we do not find them adapted to our use, ex- 
cept in the High School. In the Normal Department of the 
High School, they are still practiced, with very satisfactory re- 
sults. 
The High School is partially supplied with dumb-bells which 
have already done valuable service, and several of the divisions have 
also been very successful in the use of bean-bags. An expenditure 
of one or two hundred dollars in the purchase of dumb-bells and 
rings for the use of the High School would be a boon of health 
and pleasure to the pupils, and aid in restoring the lost equilibrium 
of mental and physical development. 
Two years ago the Board introduced Turner exercises into the 
High School by way of trial, during the spring and summer. A 
teacher was appointed who received a small salary; the young. 
students enjoyed these exercises much, but I am sorry to say that 
they were discontinued, simply on account of the trifling expense 
incurred thereby. Now the boys and young gentlemen practice on 
the apparatus erected in the school yard, without the supervision 
of a teacher during recess time, and are in this way exposed to all 
the dangers of inexperience and daring. 
Much has been done by all our teachers in the way of systematic 
physical culture, and yet we need more uniformity in this direction. 
This can be best attained through the Normal School. I should 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
    210 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
think it money well expended if thorough instruction could be given 
in some well-balanced system to all the classes of the High School. 
The practice is much needed there, and through this all our schools 
may be served. 
While the above statements are more or less incom- 
plete, yet it is obvious that physical training had not 
been carried far enough to be regarded as much more 
than a quasi-system of training, with the meager avail- 
able equipment. On the other hand, there was a clear 
recognition by some school officials of the important 
place of physical training in secondary education. 
Previous to the eighties, comparatively few accommo- 
dations were made for the pupils’ training, and for 
the instructors’ teaching in any definite way. 
Laboratory Facilities—It will be remembered that 
Rousseau as an educational theorist in his Emile advo- 
cated with exaggeration that children should be al- 
lowed to make their own apparatus for doing science 
work in the schools. This suggestion had full oppor- 
tunity for free trial in the first years of the Chicago 
High School. This recommendation, like every other 
one that has some truth in it, showed its limitation in 
the first high school of Chicago. For during the very 
first year of the school’s history it is stated that: 
“The most pressing want of the high school that still 
remains is a supply of suitable apparatus for illustra- 
tion and experiment in the various departments of 
science. It is impossible to give satisfactory instruc- 
tion in such branches as chemistry, Natural Philoso- 
phy, and Surveying, without the aid of apparatus, and 
it is to be hoped that immediate provision will be made 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 211 
for the successful prosecution of the course of study 
prescribed by the Board.’’ 
After the High School had been in operation one 
year and a half, it was reported that the apparatus for 
illustrating the different branches of science was 
limited to a supply of black-boards and chalk. The 
whole value of the maps, globes and other apparatus 
belonging to the grammar and primary schools of the 
city did not exceed $25. It was contended that there 
could not be found another city of even 50,000 inhabit- 
ants with so scanty a supply of apparatus in the public 
schools. 
“7 The reports state: 
It is impossible for the High School to furnish satisfactory in- 
struction in such branches as Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, 
Astronomy and Surveying, without the aid of appropriate appa- 
ratus; and the Grammar and Primary schools greatly need a supply 
of outline maps and globes. . . . 
It is now nearly three years since this institution was organized 
and it is already firmly implanted in the confidence and affection of 
the city. The course of discipline and instruction is thorough and 
complete and challenges comparison with that of the best High 
Schools of the country. The valuable Philosophical and Chemical 
apparatus recently procured at an expense of one thousand dollars, 
through the kindness and liberality of the friends of the school, 
and the donation of a large and powerful microscope, and accom- 
panying diagrams, by Samuel Hoard, Esq., have removed the great- 
est obstacle to the success of the school that has hitherto existed. 
The sum of $1,000 generously subscribed by the parents of pupils 
in the High School and by other citizens, for the purchase of 
Chemical and Philosophical Apparatus, was expended under the 
direction of a committee appointed by your Board. The apparatus 
is now in daily use in the school. Additional articles will from  
-P-A-G-E-234
212 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
time to time be needed, particularly for facilitating the study of 
Astronomy. 
No addition was made to the Apparatus, or the laboratory during 
the past year. While the present Apparatus is nearly adequate 
in the departments of Natural Philosophy, Astronomy and Chem- 
istry, various maps and charts to facilitate instruction in Physiology, 
Geology and History, are greatly needed. The school is yet un- 
provided with a single map or chart to illustrate either of these 
branches. It is manifestly impossible to furnish adequate instruc- 
tion without them. 
The instruction in Mathematics and the Natural Sciences has been 
very accurate and thorough. History and English Literature, to 
which is wisely assigned more time than is usual in similar schools, 
have been taught with success. Much assistance has been derived in 
these studies from maps and charts, prepared with great care and 
ingenuity by the teachers of the departments. 
There is a serious drawback to successful instruction in the lack 
of specimens and apparatus. A small beginning has been made 
toward the formation of a Geological Cabinet by the presentation of 
valuable specimens by Geo. F. Rumsey, Esq., of Chicago, and the 
school possesses a good philosophical apparatus. But there is a 
need of a large collection of both geological and mineralogical 
specimens and a chemical apparatus equal to the philosophical, 
properly to illustrate the studies of this department. For the 
former, we must rely largely on the voluntary contributions of 
citizens and friends of the school. The latter will probably at some 
time be purchased by the Board. 
At the regular meeting of the Board of Education, held April 
13, 1875, the following Estimate of Expenditures for the Fiscal year 
commencing April 1, 1875, was adopted by the Board, and re- 
ferred to the Common Council for their action;—Repairs to Phi- 
losophical Apparatus at High School and for Chemicals, ete. 
It is obvious that there was very little of the present 
opportunity to work with elaborate equipment in high 
school sciences. But the statements recorded as made 
by Mr. Dupee, the first principal, indicate that he had
-P-A-G-E-235
  
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL — 213 
become quite conscious of the need, and that he ap- 
preciated in a rather remarkable way the real problem 
of successful science teaching through the use of 
proper laboratory apparatus. 
Library Books.——When one considers the present- 
day discussion relative to high school libraries both 
with reference to content, and to organization and 
management, it is possible to look back with a good 
deal of interest upon the earlier attempts to establish 
a library in the original Chicago High School. This 
first library, donated by Mr. Flavel Moseley, is to be 
found largely intact in the present McKinley High 
School building. An examination of the library 
shows that it consisted predominantly of books on 
literature and history, with some volumes on math- 
ematics and general science and a few books on moral 
and religious questions. There are over 100 volumes 
on the British poets and essayists, such as Words- 
worth, Spenser, Dryden, Milton, Shelley, Swift, Moore, 
Pope, Shakespeare and Steele. The rules of the 
library, a part of which appear in this discussion, 
are pasted in the front of each volume. Some of these 
books seem too mature for high school pupils, it is 
true, and there is to be found here one of the most 
suggestive current problems of the high school. The 
control of the library as found stated in the rules is 
a bit different from our present methods of control. 
It would be interesting to know how the actual use of 
the books in the earlier day really compared to the 
present use by pupils. 
The reports make the following statements concern- 
ing the library:
-P-A-G-E-236
  214 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Library—At a meeting of the Board of School Inspectors, 
Nov. 29, 1856, the Chairman of the Board, with characteristic 
liberality, presented the following communication: 
To the Board of School Inspectors: 
In the beautiful High School edifice recently erected by the en- 
lightened liberality of our city, is a room appropriated for the use 
of a library. That apartment is yet unoccupied. I proposed to 
give five hundred dollars to commence what I hope will soon become 
a respectable and useful High School library. I would recommend 
that a committee be appointed to expend the money in purchasing 
such reading matter as they may deem appropriate and to prepare 
such rules and regulations as may be necessary to secure proper use 
and presentation. 
Respectfully yours, 
F. Moseley. 
Library—Early in 1857, the $500 donated by Flavel Moseley Esq. 
was expended in the purchase of suitable books for the High School 
Library; and cases have since been provided for their preservation. 
Some additions have been made to the number of volumes during 
the year. The library is indebted for numerous public documents 
to Honorable J. H. Woodworth, and to “a few friends” for John- 
son’s Physical Atlas and other valuable works. The number of 
volumes in the library is 413. 
The following are the rules adopted in the distribution of the 
books: 
Regulations 
Article 1. The library shall be opened at the close of the afternoon 
session every Thursday in term time. 
Article 2. The teachers of the High School may have access to the 
library any time, and may draw books from it in ac- 
cordance with articles 4 and 5. 
Article 8. Any pupil whose total average for any month shall equal 
or exceed 86, may draw books from the Library the 
ensuing month, and any whose average shall equal or 
exceed 94, may have access to the Library at such times 
as the principal may designate.
-P-A-G-E-237
  
  
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 215 
Article 4. No folio, quarto or cyclopedia shall be taken from the 
library, but may be there consulted. 
Article 5. No one shall have more than one book from the library at 
any time and no book shall be retained more than two 
weeks. 
Article 6. Any person injuring or losing any book belonging to the 
library shall make compensation for the same, and 
failing to do so, shall be excluded from the library. 
Article 7. The librarian shall keep an account of the names of all 
drawing books from the library; the numbers and the 
names of the books and the date of drawing and re- 
turning. 
Article 8. The pupil having the highest total average for any month 
shall act as Librarian for the succeeding month. 
Article 9. The library shall be under the special care and supervi- 
sion of the principal, subject to the direction of the 
Board of Education. 
No additions have been made to the library during the past 
year. It now contains 416 volumes, most of them standard works. 
The books may be classified as follows: Scientifie Works, Cyclope- 
dias, ete. 140 Vols., History, 60 Vols., Biography, 35 Vols., Essays, 
40 Vols., Miscellaneous, 61 Vols. 
The library is devoted to the use of the teachers and pupils of 
the High School. It has been in constant use during the past year. 
A judiciously selected library is of great service in promoting a 
taste for science and literature among the pupils, and in enabling 
them to extend their researches beyond the narrow limits of the text- 
books. It is also of invaluable service to teachers, affording them an 
opportunity for the investigation of subjects kindred to those which 
they are daily called upon to teach. It seems important that some 
provision be made to increase the number of volumes in the library. 
Program of Studies—The High School as early 
proposed and the one actually organized later on, 
differed somewhat, as may be seen from a _ statement 
of the actual facts in the later development of this 
institution. The committee commented as follows:
-P-A-G-E-238
  216 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The proposed High School would in our opinion, be divided into 
two departments, male and female, with suitable instructors for both 
sexes. The studies should be comprehensive, embracing such a 
range as would fit a pupil to enter any of our best regulated 
colleges. In the female department, instead of Latin and Greek, 
the German and French languages might be substituted. If, how- 
ever, this range should be considered too extensive, the languages 
might be wholly omitted and the students confined to an English 
course proper, embracing Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Astrology, 
Intellectual Philosophy, Physiology, General and Natural History, 
Physical Geography, Political Economy, Algebra, Geometry and 
Trigonometry, including Surveying and Engineering. 
In the original form, the program of studies or 
subjects offered in the Central High School was organ- 
ized under three departments known as English High, 
three years; the Classical, three years; and the 
Normal, two years in length, respectively. One reason 
for the existence of the original Central High School 
was to unify more closely the whole public school sys- 
tem of the city. The school year during the fifties 
was divided under a three-term plan, and this arrange- 
ment continued for more than fifty years. In 1860, 
the length of the English Course, as well as that of 
the Classical Course, was changed to four years in- 
stead of three. From 1856 to 1869 all high school 
education was conducted within the Central High 
School. In 1869, one-year high school classes were 
organized in the grammar schools of the city. In 1875 
courses two years in length were established in three 
different divisions of the city. In 1868 a special 
course had been provided in the Central High School 
for those who wished to prepare for college. 
Free instruction was offered to both boys and girls
-P-A-G-E-239
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 217 
from the beginning of the high school work in the city. 
Pupils were admitted to the academic department at 
twelve years of age after having passed an exam- 
ination in the grammar school studies, and upon 
the approval of the superintendent and the princi- 
pal. 
At the time the Central High School was organized 
only a general statement of the nature of the course 
of study was issued. About five years later there 
appeared a synopsis of each of the three courses of- 
fered. The general nature of these courses, as well 
as the sequential arrangement, may be seen in the 
synopses of the classical and general courses. The 
general course included three years of mathematics; 
four years of foreign language; one year of rhetoric 
and literature, together with composition and declama- 
tion throughout the year; two years of science; 
two years of history and political economy combined; 
one year of geography.and physiology; and one year 
of intellectual philosophy, logic and moral science com- 
bined. All pupils were required to take either Latin 
or German during the first two years. At the begin- 
ning of the third year they were allowed to continue 
their Latin or German, or to choose French instead. 
When a later course was outlined, in the sixties, the 
general nature of the course was in most respects 
about the same. 
In the classical course there were included two 
years of mathematics; seven years of foreign lan- 
guage, Greek beginning in the third year; one year 
of science; one year of history; one year of geography
-P-A-G-E-240
  218 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
and physiology; and Composition and Declamation 
throughout the entire course. 
In 1869, in connection with the course of instruc- 
tion, attention was called, as was repeatedly done 
during the latter half of the nineteenth century, to 
the fact that there were two classes of pupils to be 
considered in the schools, namely, those requiring 
groundwork for college education, and those prepar- 
ing for practical life before finishing the high school. 
The content of the courses by 1861 may be seen 
from the synopses below. Revisions were made in 
1869, 1872, 1882 and 1890, gradually enlarging the na- 
ture of the courses so as to include some of the newer 
content. This paved the way for the expansion and 
multiplication of different types of courses inaugur- 
ated in the twenty-four high schools at present in ex- 
istence in Chicago. 
One object of this detailed discussion is to point out 
the fact that in germ the present-day, twentieth- 
century high school problems relating to buildings, 
gymnasium, laboratory, library equipment and pro- 
gram of studies were already pretty definitely mapped 
out in the middle of the nineteenth century in the 
Chicago Public School system, in however simple a 
form they may have appeared. It is profitable in any 
city or state school system, in an evaluation of its prog- 
ress, to take into account as long a survey of years 
of school practice as possible. One more generation, 
and it will not be possible to get at so much of the 
earlier history of our high schools through personal 
statements of those who were in some way connected 
with the first ones, either as pupils or as teachers or

otker officers. It is with some appreciation of this 
historic sense and functional value of earlier practice 
that an effort has been made to trace in detail the 
development of Chicago high school education during
-P-A-G-E-243
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 222 
the middle of the nineteenth century. What we have 
in most textbooks is a necessarily shortened statement 
of the original number of high schools which developed 
during the middle of the nineteenth century in 
America. It has seemed pertinent to give a detailed 
history of one representative city relative to high 
school problems. The germs of many present-day 
problems appear in the foregoing statements. 
Beginnings of Tendencies toward Reorganization 
in the Nineties 
During the last quarter of the nineteenth century 
high schools multiplied much more rapidly than at any 
previous time. The outstanding policies, however, 
which had been dominant up to 1865, when high schools 
had become pretty thoroughly established, were con- 
tinued without much, if any, change, up to the nineties. 
In the meantime, owing to legislation and other fac- 
tors, high schools had been extended into the more 
rural centers of the United States as well as within 
the cities. Increased facilities for travel, improved 
means of communication, multiplication of indus- 
tries and interstate and international policies had, 
ever since the establishment of the first Latin 
grammar school in America, been developing a very 
complex situation to which the American school had 
been compelled to adjust itself in order to render the 
largest service. 
The Report of the Committee of Ten in 1893.—In 
later chapters of this text the preliminary steps in 
reorganized or reconstructed secondary education will
-P-A-G-E-244
  222 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
be discussed in connection with the junior high school 
and junior college movements. The present chapter 
has been concerned primarily with the permanent 
establishment of the high school as a democratic in- 
stitution. Among the numerous factors or influences 
operative in Secondary education during the last dec- 
ade of the nineteenth century was the report of the 
Committee of Ten. 
While a difference of opinion exists as to the relative 
importance of the recommendations of this committee, 
it is certain that its work marks the beginning of 
certain prominent problems of reorganized secondary - 
education. The chairman of the Board of Trustees 
of the National Educational Association, in a pref- 
atory note to the published report wrote that ‘‘it 
is the most important educational document ever is- 
sued in the United States.’? The report was published 
in 1893. 
President Charles W. Eliot of Harvard, W. T. 
Harris, United States Commissioner of Education, and 
eight other college and high school men constituted 
the committee. The committee resolved itself into 
nine different conferences, namely, 1. Latin, 2. Greek, 
3. English, 4. Modern Languages, 5. Mathematics, 6. 
Physics, Astronomy and Chemistry, 7. Natural His- 
tory, 8. History, Civil Government and Political 
Economy, 9. Physical Geography, Geology and - 
Meteorology. Hach conference was constituted of ten 
members, including both college and secondary school 
men. Of these ninety members, forty-two were con- 
nected with the high schools and forty-seven with the 
colleges.
-P-A-G-E-245
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 223 
A miscellaneously selected list of questions was 
outlined as a guide for their discussions in the con- 
ferences as, for example: At what age should certain 
studies be begun in the high school? When should 
differentiation begin, if at all? What should be the 
total amount of time given to'a subject, and how should 
it be distributed over the four years, and in what se- 
quence should different parts of a subject be offered? 
Should subjects be presented to pupils who plan to go 
to liberal arts schools in a manner different from that 
employed with pupils who plan to go to scientific 
schools? 
General Problems Raised by the Committee—In 
the case of certain problems all of the conferences 
were largely in agreement. It is of interest to read 
in their reports that they found their tasks especially 
difficult in considering physics, astronomy, chemistry, 
natural history, history, civil government, political 
economy and geography because these subjects were 
so new and had as yet been very imperfectly dealt 
with in the schools. All of the conferences except the 
one on Greek made recommendations as to changes in 
the primary and grammar grades as well as in the sub- 
sequent programs of study in the secondary schools. 
While the unity of the elementary and secondary 
school was not solved by them, the problem was 
raised. Certain statements represent preliminary dis- 
cussions and stages of the junior-senior high school 
reorganization of today. They were agreed that the 
elements of their several subjects should be taught 
earlier, and they recommended that, except in the case 
of languages, perspective views and broad surveys  
-P-A-G-E-246
  224 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of subjects be given in the elementary school, and 
that later more detailed treatment be given again to 
parts of these subjects. They furthermore antici- 
pated the reorganization of secondary schools in their 
assertion that four years, the span of the high school 
as then administered, was too short a time to be de- 
voted to secondary education. They specifically sug- 
gested that algebra, geometry, natural science and 
foreign languages should begin either in the upper 
grades of the eight-year elementary school, or else in 
the first two years of a six-year secondary school. 
The problem of uniform college entrance requirements 
and the articulation of high school and college occu- 
pied considerable attention on the part of the con- 
ferences. 
Special Emphasis upon the Organization and Selec- 
tion of Curricula——While the Committee of Ten con- 
. cerned itself with a number of secondary school 
problems, most of its time in the conferences was 
given to the problem of curriculum organization. As 
may be observed from the original report, four cur- 
ricula are suggested, namely: (1) Classical, (2) Latin- 
Scientific, (3) Modern Language and (4) English. 
It announced two so-called general principles of 
program-making. In the first place, the final choice 
between the classical and Latin-scientifie courses was 
to be delayed on the part of the pupil until the third 
year, since at any previous time the pupil had not 
sufficiently discovered his tastes. In the second place, 
as many of the pupils did not stay beyond two years, 
the committee wished the program of the first two 
years to be represented by the fundamental groups  
-P-A-G-E-247
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL = 225 
of subjects necessary to all. These groups were to be 
constituted of the linguistic, mathematical, historical 
and scientific subjects. The percentage of time to be 
devoted to these groups of subjects was very much 
the highest in case of foreign languages in all four 
of the curricula recommended. English and mathe- 
matics were given about equal emphasis in all of the 
four courses. From a detailed study of the four cur- 
ricula it will be observed that the present-day subjects 
known as practical and vocational arts do not find 
a place. 
Limitations of the Report in Comparison with Pres- 
ent-Day Social Needs and Economic Demands.—The 
efforts of this committee to make a serious study of 
the problems of secondary education as such, both 
alone in relation to elementary education, as well as 
its special attempts to evaluate school subjects and 
organize school curricula, should be given due recogni- 
tion and credit. The work of the nine conferences 
together with that of the committee as a whole did 
bring into the foreground certain prominent and per- 
sistent problems in secondary education. Survey or 
introductory courses, selection of appropriate topics 
under subjects, total time distribution, progressive 
and sequential order of subject matter, the importance 
of laboratory work in methods of teaching science, 
the articulation of elementary and secondary schools, 
and of secondary schools and colleges were all prob- 
lems pertinent for discussion. 
On the other hand, the committee committed itself 
to a very important general principle which was not 
provided for in its curriculum offerings. To quote:
-P-A-G-E-248
226 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The secondary schools of the United States, taken as a whole, 
do not exist for the purpose of preparing boys and girls for col- 
leges. .. . Their main function is to prepare for the duties of 
life that small proportion of all the children in the country... 
who show themselves able to profit by an education prolonged to the 
eighteenth year. ...A secondary school program intended for 
national use must, therefore, be made for those children whose 
education is not to be pursued beyond the secondary school. . . . 
At the same time, it is obviously desirable that the colleges and 
scientific schools should be accessible to all boys or girls who have 
completed creditably the secondary school course. .. . The recom- 
mendations of the nine conferences . . . might fairly be held to make 
all the main subjects taught in the sceondary schools of equal rank 
for the purpose of admission to college or scientific school . . . and 
at least three of the subjects shall have been pursued three years 
or more. 
One obvious limitation of the above-quoted attitude 
is that, while the principle of training pupils for a 
variety of later non-academic roads is announced, in 
the end the committee outlined but one college-ward 
road for all pupils graduating, by delimiting the types 
or groups of studies to be pursued in high school pri- 
marily to the academic. In harmony with other writers, 
the author here assumes that certain limitations were 
apparent in the committee’s report, and that certain 
modifications are now necessary because of outstand- 
ing demands that the American high school meet 
adequately new social needs. These needs it is the 
business of the promoters of reorganized secondary 
education during the twentieth century to meet, so 
far as it is humanly possible to do so through a demo- 
cratic secondary school system. 
Granting that the high school should provide for the 
individual capacities, interests and social needs of 
|
-P-A-G-E-249
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIGH SCHOOL 227 
pupils coming from all classes of society, the following 
limitations of the committee’s report are apparent. 
On the side of subject matter itself, foreign languages 
were given too large prominence relative to the total 
time allowance for other subjects; and the four cur- 
ricula were organized in terms of traditionally per- 
fected subjects practically to the exclusion of a recog- 
nition of practical life activities and necessities and 
the corresponding practical arts subjects. In the light 
of the general principle announced that high schools 
should not merely prepare for higher institutions of 
learning, a certain inconsistency appears in the en- 
slaving and dominating influence of college entrance 
requirements on the required groups of subjects, as 
well as in the failure to provide adequately for pupils 
who were not fortunate enough to complete all of the 
four years of high school work, and finally, in an ad- 
ministrative way, in the making of very little provision 
for bifurcation or flexibility in the four curricula. 
The Problem of the Reconstruction of Secondary 
Education during the Twentieth Century 
It is a noteworthy fact that the reorganization of 
higher schools in Europe and of secondary education 
in America had their beginnings during the last dec- 
ade of the nineteenth century. However the inter- 
dependency between the corresponding reorganizations 
was perhaps small. It has been suggested that the 
principle of election, as it expressed itself in America, 
may have influenced in some measure the more flexi- 
ble practice and bifurcation of courses in the lycées 
of France. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
    228 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The necessity for the reconstruction of secondary 
education, and in some measure, consequently, of 
higher education, especially of the earlier years, has 
been inevitable. Changing concepts and revolutionary 
practices have been in evidence outside of the precincts 
of formal secondary school organization, in science, 
in industry, in business organization and in interna- 
tional affairs. In order that secondary schools may 
be able to adjust and continually readjust themselves 
to these conditions, it has become necessary for them 
to increase their number of objectives, to enlarge 
and expand the nature of the content of subject mat- 
ter, to vitalize the methods of instruction, and finally 
to consider those forms of external organization which 
will be most conducive to unifying the educative proc- 
ess from the beginning of the elementary school to 
the end of the college or university. In brief, these 
suggestions represent the challenges confronting 
secondary school administration during this greatest 
of all the periods of reconstruction in the history of 
secondary education, either in Europe or in America.

CHAPTER XII 
SOME APPLICATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLE 
OR CONCEPT OF UNITY IN THE 
EDUCATIVE PROCESS 
The Concept of Unity in the Middle Ages and the 
Closed Systems of Thinking—The concept of unity 
has been applied to human experience in a great 
variety of ways. For convenience of discussion one 
may characterize the type of unity which appeared in 
the treatises written during the Middle Ages as pre- 
dominantly philosophical. The nature of these dis- 
cussions was often very abstract. Usually they had 
to do with some form of the theory or problem of 
knowledge. The church was the only highly organized 
institution of that day. Religious and philosophical 
discussions were closely interwoven. The net out- 
come of these highly abstract discussions was that the 
systems of thought contained in them became, through 
detailed logical analysis, so highly perfected as to be- 
come closed and static. Since unquestioned obedience 
to authority represented the outstanding character- 
istic of the Church as a Middle Age institution, there 
was little opportunity for dealing in new ways with 
new problems, and also little opportunity for the de- 
velopment of individual initiative. The concept of 
Middle Age unity is, therefore, not well-adapted to 
our modern educational situations. 
232
-P-A-G-E-255
  
THE EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT OF UNITY 233 
“Unity in variety’’ as now conceived is much less 
static in nature than it was in the Middle Ages. Unity 
may express itself in a great variety of ways. Dif- 
ferent aspects are interrelated. So conceived, it 
represents, or is composed of, many complementary 
phases. In the words of William James, ‘‘to know 
one thing thoroughly is to know the universe.’’ Or 
again, to paraphase the words of this world-famed 
psychologist, the ‘‘over-lapping problems’? of of human 
experience are many, and_almost_ ‘overwhelming | in 
their proportions, It is with this modern sort of unity 
that the present discussion has to do. The chief oc- 
casion for referring to the earlier philosophical type 
of unity is that it furnishes, by way of contrast with 
our own thinking, an illustration of a concept that 
was then too abstract and empty to be of much prac- 
tical value in educational practice. The slavish use 
of this earlier concept of unity led to formal and empty 
dogmatisms. Progress in any field of endeavor was 
practically impossible under such conditions. It~is, 
therefore, desirable and necessary now ‘to_think of a 
type of unity much enriched and much less fixed, in 
whatever form it may chance to appear. Unity will 
serve as a suitable guiding principle or fundamental 
concept in the reorganization of the present educa- 
tional institutions and of their practices. 
It is apparent, without continued argument, that in 
the modern dynamic world of new interests in re- 
ligion, politics, industry and education, mere dogma- 
tisms will not suffice. One virtue, of course, existed 
in the earlier philosophical discussions, in that a num- 
ber of significant religious, scientific and philosophical 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
    234 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
problems were raised. One of these, it is well known, 
is with us yet, namely, what is the relation of the in- 
dividual to society, or to organized institutions? In 
the midst of current social surroundings, it is abso- 
lutely necessary to make new analyses on somewhat 
different patterns than were used in the Middle Age 
discussions. It is the business of the modern insti- 
tution known as the school to unify and codrdinate 
the interests of society on quite a different basis than 
that on which the Middle Age Church attempted to 
operate. And this is true chiefly for the reason that 
the factors and conditions to be considered are very 
different from those of earlier days. New occasions 
and new theories demand new duties and procedures. 
Just because of this multiplication of all sorts of new 
factors it is essential that an attempt be made to see 
some unity in educational institutions and educative 
processes as a whole. Interrelations do exist. It is 
one function of educational institutions to attempt to 
lead individuals by degrees or gradations to see those 
relations which do exist between various types of hu- 
man knowledge, and between institutions of one sort 
and another. 
The Interpretation of the Meaning of Principles as 
Applied to the Educative Process as a Whole.—So 
thought-provoking a writer in the field of education 
as Froebel advocated a concept of unity in his book 
entitled Education of Man, which was too symbolic 
and abstract in some instances to be of much practical 
value in educational procedure. His emphasis, how- 
ever, upon the unity of the stages of infancy, childhood,
-P-A-G-E-257
THE EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT OF UNITY 235 
youth and adulthood is significant. The earlier 
overemphasis in this country on the more purely 
intellectualistic aspect of educational theory led to 
some criticism as to the real value of a philosophy 
of education at all. Two remarks can be made on this 
point. First, the philosophy of education needed 
most by the secondary school man at the present time 
is that which is developed out of the social life and 
the problems which must be faced by all persons in 
all stations. Second, it is necessary to give meaning 
just as far as possible to the educative process of 
the pupil at all stages. The beginning of a more real- 
istic and meaningful interpretation can be made in the 
secondary school. Much evidence of the need of in- 
terpreting the educative process may be found in the 
instance of the student who has entered college. 
When the phrase, ‘‘philosophy of secondary educa- 
tion,’’ is qualified in the above manner there is much 
to be said in its favor. 
The chief purpose of this chapter is to attempt 
to give meaning to the application, in its various 
forms, of the principle of unity to the educative pro- 
cess, as carried on in the form of our now organized 
educational ladder. Too much cannot be said with 
reference to the necessity of training all persons who 
are connected with a secondary school in the ability to 
see the whole institution in action, as well as in the abil- 
ity to see the meaning of the whole of the educa- 
tive process throughout the school life of the pupil. 
This contention holds not only for instructors in 
secondary schools, but also for those individuals em- 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
236 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ployed in all other grades or stages of educational in- 
stitutions, as well as for persons connected with 
non-educational institutions. 
The American practice with reference to an organ- 
ized educational ladder is different from the European. 
European countries on the whole do not have an edu- 
cational ladder linking up their elementary and sec- 
ondary schools. With them—France, Germany and 
England, for example—elementary and secondary 
schools exist as dual or parallel institutions, side by 
side, each primarily on its own foundation. In 
America there is a strong conviction that the closest 
relation should exist between the kindergarten and the 
elementary school, between the elementary and the 
secondary school and between secondary education and 
higher education. This principle of unity or continu- 
ity should apply to the whole of the educative process 
from the lowest to the highest organized educational 
institutions in America. The discussion in this chap- 
ter will be limited primarily to the principle of unity 
as applied to the pupil’s experience in the secondary 
school. 
Unity as Applied to the Learning Process of the 
Pupil.—Because of present interest in the learning 
process, it is natural to begin a discussion of the appli- 
eation of unity with what may be characterized as 
the psychological unity of the mental development 
of pupils. Unity as applied to the learning process 
necessitates a revised version of traditional psychol- 
ogy, which assumes that mental activities or traits 
such as sensory processes, perception, memory and 
reasoning, were more or less separate entities, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
THE EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT OF UNITY 237 
also that certain processes did not function or operate 
in young children at all. 
On the other hand, it is now assumed that the mind 
is a unit. That is to say, all of the mental processes 
are thought of as interrelated. The expression of one 
of them is functionally related to the expressions of all 
of the others. Furthermore, all of the mental proc- 
esses are thought of as intact and operative in the 
very early experience of the individual child. Sensory 
learning begins to function, for example, in young 
children and continues to operate to the end of the 
secondary school period, as well as later on. The 
form of the manifestation of sensory experience varies 
from year to year, but in all normal individuals sen- 
sory learning or sensory-motor learning expresses 
itself in some manner, and is never completely absent 
in any stage of school life—kindergarten, elementary, 
secondary or even college. 
In a similar way, it may be shown that perception, 
memory and reasoning are never wholly absent in 
the learning processes of normal high school pupils 
at any stage. It is important, therefore, to keep in 
mind that while the form of expression of these men- 
tal traits does change, there is never a complete ab- 
sence of any one of them. One aspect of mental ac- 
tivity may predominate for a time under one situation 
and another aspect at another time, or in another situa- 
tion. 
The above discussion has referred primarily to the 
rather purely mental traits. The same argument may 
be used also with reference to inherited traits, tend- 
encies or instincts of individuals. Curiosity, play, 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  238 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
constructiveness and gregariousness, for example, are 
representative of the universal inheritances of all 
normal individuals, savage and civilized. Such in- 
herited instincts are present from the outset of ex- 
perience, and of course may manifest themselves in 
varying degrees at different times. But they are there 
all the time, being expressed either overtly or in more 
subdued form, and in varying forms from time to time. 
The absence or the presence of these mental traits 
and the inherited instincts is not of so much concern 
as is the varying form of their constant manifestation. 
From the above very brief discussion of the simul- 
taneous and unbroken expression of mental and 
instinctive traits, it is justifiable to make the generali- 
zation that all acquired and inherited tendencies of 
individuals tend to develop continuously without 
abrupt breaks. One pedagogical implication of large 
importance is that: this principle of the continuity of 
mental development should be understood by all 
teachers, supervisors and administrators in second- 
ary education in order that subject matter may be 
offered and presented to the learning pupil without 
radical transitions so great as to discourage them. 
For the good of the pupil in his learning activities, 
the continuity of mental development should be in- 
telligently observed by instructors. 
The Vertical and Horizontal Relation of Educational 
Objectives.—It will be recalled that the unity of the 
learning process was previously considered in a two- 
fold sense, namely, the interrelation between the men- 
tal processes themselves as well as their continued 
progression from one stage to another of the pupil’s
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT OF UNITY 239 
development. This may be characterized as the lat- 
itudinal and longitudinal unity. Analogously, one 
may apply the principle of unity to educational aims 
or objectives. A half dozen or more secondary school 
objectives, which will later be discussed in more detail, 
are now recognized throughout the country by school 
officers. The seven objectives outlined by the National 
Education Association committee and by others will 
be referred to frequently in this text. These are def- 
initely interrelated, as numerous writers have pointed 
out. In the process of the realization of any one of 
them, some one or more of the others may become, in 
part, realized. These seven educational objectives 
represent a variety of phases which lead to a unified 
common goal. The horizontal interrelation of educa- 
tional aims has been emphasized almost solely in the 
theoretical discussions of the past. 
It is very important to stress the progressive unity 
of objectives and their realization throughout the 
nursery school, the kindergarten, the elementary 
school and the secondary school. The practice, for 
example, of providing for the realization of the health 
objective stages or years of our educational system 
chosen merely at random is not desirable and certainly 
not justifiable. The same argument may be used in 
the instances of the civic and the social objectives. The 
degrees of the realization of these objectives during 
the different stages or years of school experience will 
vary, of course, so far as the pupil is concerned. This 
progressive realization of the objectives in elemen- 
tary and secondary education represents a series of 
real challenges to school administrators of the next
-P-A-G-E-262
  240 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
decade. Education with reference to health, or to 
the social good or to leisure-time activity should 
be observed throughout all stages of formal educa- 
tion. 
The Recognition of Unity as Applied to the Reorgan- 
ization of the Content of Subject Matter.—It is possible 
to defend the thesis of this chapter with vigor on 
account of certain developments that have recently 
occurred with reference to the change of subject mat- 
ter in modern secondary schools. For example, many 
teachers at one time did not give much thought to the 
matter of outlining in any related way the materials 
taught. It has now become common practice to out- 
line materials in terms of larger unit-topics of in- 
struction than once were used. By ‘‘unit-topic’’ is 
here meant a certain amount of work outlined to be 
covered in a specified period of time, say six weeks. 
These larger unit-topics of work, say half a dozen for a 
semester, may be broken up for further treatment into 
sub-topics. The sub-topics or problems of the larger 
units may be treated gradually in more intensive form 
from the beginning of the junior high school to the end 
of the senior high school. 
Then, there is the possibility, too, of tying up the 
subject matter taught in the upper elementary grades 
with that of the high school proper, even under the 
eight-four plan. One of the most frequent complaints 
of the high school freshman is that the subject mat- 
ter becomes so difficult all at once, in contrast to that 
which was offered in the elementary school, that it 
simply cannot be mastered. How far this complaint 
can be justified may, of course, be debatable. But the
-P-A-G-E-263
YS ere OO SMO ST Nie OP MMERERS EERE Ge PTR TALC e hy ae mie te pn Ty SOR eRe oe nee 
THE EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT OF UNITY 241 
fact that the question is so frequently raised is one 
reason why some attempt should be made to analyze 
the difficulty. This progressive correlation or articu- 
lation of subject matter between elementary and sec- 
ondary education in a successful way is one of the 
chief challenges of our day. This same line of discus- 
sion may be carried out with reference to the relation 
between the secondary school and college. 
While the one-time much discussed Herbartian doc- 
trine of correlation is not at all slavishly followed, 
especially in the secondary schools of our day, still, 
there are certain aspects of the present discussion 
which seem indirectly to be related to this earlier doc- 
trine. According to the Herbartians, everything was 
to be correlated around history,geography and litera- 
ture. The revised version of the unity of subjects, 
however, does not give any single subject or even 
group of subjects a corner on the intellectual market 
in the program of studies as a whole. Especially is 
it true that the principle of unity is intimately tied 
up with the recent attempts in the junior high school 
to offer introductory subjects, such as unified or gen- 
eral mathematics, general science and composite or 
general social science. One avowed purpose of the 
advocates ,of these introductory courses is to connect 
the work of the junior high school and the senior high 
school more closely, as well as to make the transition 
less abrupt for the pupil. It is a noteworthy fact 
that the close relation of vitalized subject matter is 
now recognized as an important desideratum in the 
program of studies. Mechanical duplication of ma- 
terials taught will likely be the result, in the newer
-P-A-G-E-264
  242 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
attempts, unless the junior and senior high schools 
make a conscious effort progressively to correlate 
their work. In the event of this mere mechanical du- 
plication, the result will be simply the old problem 
of treadmill work put into new form. 
Unity as Applied to the External Form of School 
Organization—Whether the elementary part of our 
American educational ladder, considered in terms of 
external organization, shall have six, seven, eight or 
nine rungs is still open to some debate. Whether the 
system shall be reorganized so that the elementary 
school shall be represented by six rungs, the junior 
high school by three and the senior high school by 
three, and, perchance, the junior college by two, is a 
question that has received wide consideration. Per- 
haps no one is able as yet to say absolutely of what 
number of rungs the secondary school should consist. 
One can be relatively certain, however, that whenever 
there are any distinct rungs which represent for pupils 
highly demarcated breaks in the school system, there is 
need on the part of administrative officers for applying 
the principle of unity. One of the limitations of the 
old eighth grade graduation was that pupils were tem- 
porarily deceived by the belief that they had com- 
pleted all of the education necessary to their welfare. 
The necessity of administrative unity expressed in 
one form or another will no doubt be accepted by any 
one interested in the real education of secondary 
school pupils. While the form of external organiza- 
tion may in some respects seem to be unimportant, 
yet it cannot be wholly disregarded. 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  THE EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT OF UNITY 243 
Unity and Coéperation of the Entire Teaching Corps. 
—The codperation of the whole teaching staff is nec- 
essary in order to produce satisfactory results in 
terms of school products. This fundamental tenet is 
so obvious that it is likely to be underestimated. The 
engendering of like-mindedness within any group of 
persons is a somewhat difficult task whether it be in 
an industrial plant, in a trade union, in a religious 
organization or within an educational institution. It 
is no easy matter even within a school system. 
For the best interests of the pupil, codperation be- 
tween the teachers of the various departments, as well 
as between supervisors or principals and teachers, is 
essential. This unity of purpose among teachers is 
closely connected with the unity of the learning 
process of the pupil. Oneness of purpose realized 
through the codperation of instructors working in all 
departments not only increases the joy of the work of 
the school, but prevents educational loss and waste. 
One or more instructors out of harmony with the com- 
mon aims of the institution as a whole not only tends 
to mar the entire spirit of the institution, but at the 
same time tends to decrease the efficiency. Like- 
mindedness intelligently applied to the school system 
simultaneously increases the pleasure of teaching and 
improves the efficiency of instruction. 
There is no more profitable experience for instruc- 
tors, professionally considered, than that of having 
an intelligent understanding of the problems of the 
departments of their colleagues. The experience of 
an instructor in attempting to relate his problems to
-P-A-G-E-266
  244 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
those of the departments of his colleagues will do very 
much to keep him from seeing educational affairs 
narrowly, and out of perspective. The possibility of 
breaking up the ennui of teaching by keeping alive to 
the interests of instructors in other departments, and 
thereby maintaining one’s educational perspective, 
would be sufficient argument for this practice. 
But in addition to this, it is necessary for instruc- 
tors all the way through the educational life of pupils 
to help them to see the relations that exist between 
various school subjects. It is often true that pupils 
may not see the connections between various school 
subjects until they are near the end of their secondary 
school work. It is surprising how much need there is, 
even on the college level, for helping students to cor- 
relate the different fundamental aspects of the various 
subjects studied. During recent years there has been 
considerable written concerning ‘‘compartmental’’ 
teaching and ‘‘comprehensive’’? examinations in 
college. The virtue of these procedures is found 
largely in the fact that one’s bits of knowledge gath- 
ered throughout one’s formal school life become sig- 
nificantly related and take on unified meaning. It is 
doubtful whether it can be assumed that students will 
accomplish this end unless the instructors, from year 
to year throughout the high school and college periods, 
tend to stress the necessity for relating facts and prin- 
ciples that have been acquired in the study of a variety 
of subjects. In other words, it is necessary for in- 
structors to assist pupils in seeing relations which 
exist between different subjects studied just as it is
-P-A-G-E-267
  
THE EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT OF UNITY 245 
necessary that teachers assist pupils in the habit of 
making valid generalizations. 
It does not seem to be at all unreasonable to suggest 
that the ideal represented by Tennyson in his ‘‘ Flower 
in the Crannied Wall’’ is realizable to a degree by 
many pupils of the secondary school and students of 
our colleges. Furthermore, one may remind the reader 
that the realization of the principle of unity as set 
forth in this chapter is quite analogous to the process 
or experience involved in the psychology of building 
up enriched concepts of any sort. Psychologically 
speaking, all valuable concepts are comprehensive and 
meaningful. Such a process involves seeing relations. 
It has been the purpose in this chapter to set forth 
more than an abstract and idealistic discussion of the 
principle of unity. The principle is so fundamental 
in the educative process that it is impossible to ex- 
haust its important implications. The educational 
applications have been merely suggested in terms of 
the learning process of the pupil, of the objectives of 
secondary education, of the content of subject matter 
taught, of the form of the external organization of the 
school system and of the teaching corps and its tech- 
niques of presenting subject matter. It is possible 
for the reader to find many opportunities to make 
concrete and explicit applications of the principle 
enunciated in this chapter in the supervision and ad- 
ministration of any secondary school system. With- 
out the spirit or idea of unification suggested in this 
discussion, a good deal of confusion is certain to ensue 
in the attempt to reorganize secondary education in
-P-A-G-E-268
  
  246 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
terms of the junior-senior high school and the junior 
college.

  CHAPTER XTIT 
STUDENT POPULATION, ITS CONSTITUENCY, 
INCREASE, DISTRIBUTION AND RETENTION 
Introduction—In an earlier statement, it was re- 
marked that the Committee of Ten had announced a 
significant policy and principle, namely, that provision 
should be made for all high school pupils no matter 
whether they intended to go to college later or not. 
Comparatively few significant and extensive analyses 
have been made of the personnel of high school pupils, 
or of the nature of the constituency of the student pop- 
ulation of secondary schools. More studies of this 
kind should be made. The number of students en- 
rolled and their distribution and retention are aspects 
closely related to the nature of the personnel of the 
secondary school. 
Relation of Total Population to High School Popu- 
lation.— When the first census was reported, in 1790, 
as approximately 4,000,000 people, hardly the sem- 
blance of a modern so-called democratic secondary 
school had yet begun to exist. The aristocratic 
grammar school had arisen, and almost wholly de- 
clined. By 1790 the population of New England 
alone had increased, from the time of the landing 
of the Pilgrim Fathers to the time of the establish- 
ment of the first public high school, from approx- 
imately 100 people to over 1,500,000. After high 
248
-P-A-G-E-271
  PROBLEMS OF STUDENT POPULATION 249 
schools had begun to develop, certain New England 
towns, such as Salem, Massachusetts, grew rapidly 
in population, due to various influences. In the 
case of Salem, the establishment of the milling in- 
terests brought many persons there. By comparing 
the census report of each decade with the secondary 
school enrollment for the corresponding period, it 
would be possible to determine in a general way the 
ratio between the total secondary school enrollment 
and the total population. Statistics are available, 
showing that the total population increased from about 
63,000,000 in 1890 to more than 105,000,000 in 1920. 
During the same interval of time, the high school pop- 
ulation increased from about 203,000 to over 1,500,000. 
In the year 1925, there were more than 2,000,000 pupils 
enrolled in the secondary schools of the four-year type. 
In the event that secondary education is interpreted 
as beginning with pupils of twelve instead of fourteen 
years of age, then several million more would be 
added to the list. In 1910, the census report showed 
a population of about 92,000,000. There are probably 
approximately 110,000,000 people in the United States 
at the present time. About 10,000,000 of these are of 
the four-year high school age. Between twenty-five 
and thirty percent of the number eligible are enrolled 
in high school. 
Social Differences among Pupils—In an earlier 
discussion, attention was directed to the fact that 
mental differences exist among high school pupils, and 
that such differences should be clearly recognized in 
the educative process. It is also important to recog- 
nize that social differences exist among high school 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  250 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
pupils, due to what Baldwin and other writers have 
termed social heredity. Social heredity is a generic 
phrase which represents a composite of such factors 
as language, other organized social institutions, tra- 
ditions and customs, modes of thinking and behavior 
and affective states of consciousness of groups of 
individuals, which environ them. 
Various writers have maintained that the individual 
differences of pupils due to social heredity are rela- 
tively more significant in the secondary school than 
individual differences due to biological heredity. The 
training, the occupations and the habits and customs 
of foreign and native parents respectively have con- 
siderable to do with the development of these vary- 
ing social differences. Many other factors included 
in the social heredity of pupils affect very much their 
interests and ambitions during the secondary school 
careers. Such is the nature of the composite experi- 
ences which pupils bring with them upon entering 
the secondary school. During the pupil’s attendance 
in the secondary school some of these previous ex- 
periences become modified and some of them may 
become more permanently fixed. Because of the mod- 
ifiability of these inherited social experiences, the sec- 
ondary school has an excellent opportunity to fashion 
and direct the social inheritances and interests of 
pupils. 
An Inventory of Occupations and Industries—As 
early as New England times, it was possible to observe 
certain outstanding representative industries in minia- 
ture in the different towns. Manufacturing interests 
frequently were responsible for the rapid growth of
-P-A-G-E-273
  PROBLEMS OF STUDENT POPULATION 251 
towns. The situation as contrasted with that of the 
present day was comparatively simple. Today one 
may observe secondary schools located in agricultural, 
industrial, mining, manufacturing or lumbering com- 
munities. Some schools are located in centers chiefly 
residential, as contrasted with those in business or 
industrial centers. Again, within any one of the large 
cities a great variety of environmental conditions is 
often found to exist. Consequently, schools charac- 
terized as predominantly academic, or technical, or 
trade, have grown up. The variety of occupations is 
naturally not so great in rural as in urban sections 
of the country. Still, as transportation facilities have 
tended to multiply, a situation different from that of 
a half century ago has appeared even in the rural cen- 
ters. It was earlier remarked that one function of the 
secondary school is to reflect, and another is to direct, 
the social and industrial interests of the community. 
This is another way of saying that Spencer’s tenet 
of the adjustment of individuals to environment must 
be supplemented by the attempt to remake certain un- 
satisfactory aspects of environment. Or, in harmony 
with Dewey, the adjustment of pupils to environment, 
and the adjustment of environment to the most desired 
form, are complementary processes. Or, in agree- 
ment with Inglis, ‘‘mere adjustment to existing con- 
ditions in society of the pupils in the secondary school 
is inadequate. . . . To this must be added the develop- 
ment of a capacity to readjust to the changed condi- 
tions which we may be sure will face the pupils after 
leaving the school. . . . The development of a capac- 
ity to readjust constantly to the changing conditions
-P-A-G-E-274
  252 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of life is relatively difficult.’’ Training in this capac- 
ity to anticipate the need of new adjustments carries 
with it great significance both with reference to funda- 
mental social theory in secondary education, and to 
everyday practical situations in industry, where the 
nature of occupations may shift very much from one 
decade to another. For example, an individual hay- 
ing skill in only one aspect of a trade or occupation 
may be a victim of cireumstances when new machinery 
is devised to do the work of many men, and so be com- 
pelled to acquire skill in some other aspect, or train 
himself for some more important place within the 
institution, or perchance change his occupation wholly. 
Counts’ Method of Procedure and Results Relative 
to the Selective Principle-—Theoretically, the Ameri- 
can high school has always been based upon the 
non-selective principle of education, sociologically con- 
sidered. That is to say, pupils born in any rank or 
station of life are presumably eligible to the high 
school. Several studies have been made indicating 
that pupils whose parents have been employed in the 
professional occupations and have received consid- 
erable education, tend to remain in formal school 
work longer than the pupils whose parents are 
employed in semi-skilled or unskilled occupations. 
Naturally a modicum of secondary school or college 
ideals are built up around such pupils. In addition 
to this, certain pupil-attitudes resulting from the dis- 
cussions and attitudes of tradesmen and of persons 
engaged in unskilled occupations toward formal 
schooling have a considerable influence. 
One type of approach in the analysis of the influence
-P-A-G-E-275
  PROBLEMS OF STUDENT POPULATION 253 
of the selective principle in secondary education has 
been made somewhat recently by Professor Counts 
of Yale University. His method of procedure was to 
make a study of the high school population of a lim- 
ited number of representative cities of the Northwest, 
Middle West and Hast. These cities were large 
enough to include representative groups of persons 
engaged in various occupations. A brief survey or 
inventory of the nature of the cities themselves was 
made relative to the total population, the general per- 
sonnel or characteristics of the people and the financial 
status of the variety of occupations existing; and 
finally Professor Counts made a detailed study of 
parental occupations with reference to lack of progress 
in eases of pupils of high school age who were not in 
high schools as well as with reference to progress of 
high school pupils. For the present purpose it will 
suffice to call attention to a few of the findings of this 
systematic investigation of the sociological and occu- 
pational status of the several communities. 
For convenience of treatment, occupations were 
classified by Professor Counts into sixteen different 
aspects, overlapping, of course, in certain respects. 
The first five of these were designated as proprietary, 
professional, managerial, commercial and clerical. 
The remaining eleven are constituted of a list of the 
skilled and unskilled occupations. The occupations 
of more than 17,000 fathers and guardians of high 
school pupils are tabulated. Almost twenty percent 
of the pupils represented the proprietary class, more 
than sixteen percent the managerial class, and less 
than ten percent the professional class and less than
-P-A-G-E-276
  254 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ten percent the commercial class of fathers and guard- 
jans. On the other hand, certain groups, such as 
miners, lumber-workers and fishermen, were prac- 
tically without representation. This item is of 
considerable interest since the city of Seattle hav- 
ing both lumber and fishing industries is inclu- 
ded. This phase of the study was supplemented 
by a study of the proportionate number of pu- 
pils enrolled in comparison with the adult pop- 
ulation engaged in various occupations. It was 
found that ‘‘for each one thousand men over forty- 
five years of age engaged in managerial service, 
in the four cities in 1910, there were four hundred 
students in high school,’’ and, in professional service, 
three hundred and sixty. In these results, the three 
non-labor groups, managerial, professional, and pro- 
prietary, are predominantly represented, and miscel- 
laneous and unskilled trades are comparatively low. 
Basing a generalization upon his study of the cities 
of Bridgeport, Connecticut, Mount Vernon, New York, 
St. Louis and Seattle, Professor Counts states that 
‘‘public secondary education in the United States has 
not by any means abandoned the selective principle in 
practice.’’? In terms of the ‘‘social composition of the 
adult population’’ relative to the first and last years 
of the four-year high school, he suggests that ‘‘the 
chances that the child of a father engaged in one of the 
professional pursuits will reach the Senior year of 
the high school are sixty-nine times as great as those 
of the child whose father is a common laborer.’ 
Comparison of Inglis’s and Counts’ Generalizations. 
—Are the generalizations given by Professor Inglis
-P-A-G-E-277
  PROBLEMS OF STUDENT POPULATION 255 
and Professor Counts inconsistent, or are they made 
on the basis of a different set of facts, one having 
reference to the high schools in toto and the other 
having reference to only certain years or grades of the 
high schools? Is one primarily the statement of creed 
and the other primarily a statement of fact repre- 
senting practice? The generalizations in point are 
here given in full. Professor Inglis writes that ‘‘until 
toward the close of the nineteenth century pupils en- 
rolled in the secondary schools of the country consti- 
tuted a roughly homogeneous group in the sense that 
they were boys and girls from relatively well-to-do 
American families, who for the most part looked for- 
ward to a cultural education in the high school which 
would prepare them for college and for the higher 
walks of life. The past quarter century, however, 
has marked a period in the development of secondary 
education characterized by the expansion of the sec- 
ondary school so as to provide education for classes 
of pupils never before represented in large numbers 
in the secondary school. The result has been a very 
greatly increased heterogeneity in the high school 
population, and consequently a demand for increased 
attention to the varied capacities, interests, and prob- 
able future activities of secondary school pupils, and 
to differentiated needs of society. . . . It is probably 
no exaggeration to say that the adaptation of secondary 
education on the one hand to meet the needs of differ- 
ent capacities, interests, and probable futures among 
pupils, and on the other hand to meet the differentiated 
needs of society, is the most important problem of 
secondary education at the present time.’’
-P-A-G-E-278
256 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
In general, the theory is accepted that the Ameri- 
can high school should afford an equal opportunity 
to all groups of pupils who enter. On the contrary, 
Professor Counts’ generalizations with reference to 
actual practice do not harmonize with the accepted 
theory. To quote, he says: ‘‘Not only do the various 
occupational classes exhibit different degrees of rep- 
resentation in the high school at the beginning of the 
course, but those very groups that are under- 
represented in the Freshman year have the smallest 
ratio of Seniors to Freshmen. In fact, the represen- 
tation of an occupation in the first year of the high 
school is at the same time a fairly accurate measure 
of its tendency to persist through the fourth year. 
Consequently, the differences among the groups be- 
come more and more pronounced as we pass through 
the school. The school population gradually becomes 
more and more homogeneous as the source from which 
it is drawn becomes more narrow, until, by the time the 
Senior year of the high school is reached, the student 
body exhibits a distinctly class character.’’ Ob- 
viously the generalization pertaining to graduates 
from high schools given by Professor Counts neces- 
sitates the qualification of the generalization pertain- 
ing to the high school as a whole given by Inglis. 
Of course, this raises the issue as to what is involved 
in democratic secondary education. Inevitably, local- 
ities will differ from one another. In some industrial 
communities only fifteen percent of the high school 
graduates go on to college. In academic residential 
centers sometimes as many as ninety to. ninety-five 
percent of the graduates go on to higher institutions.
-P-A-G-E-279
  PROBLEMS OF STUDENT POPULATION 257 
The higher institutions, sometimes, are predominantly 
of the liberal arts type. Sometimes graduates from 
large cosmopolitan high schools will later be distrib- 
uted about in quite a variety of professional and 
technical higher institutions of learning. 
This in turn raises the whole question as to the 
most profitable type of secondary school organization 
for different groups of pupils. A certain percentage 
of pupils, at least from five to ten percent, who are 
enrolled in secondary schools expect to attend some 
type of higher institution of learning. Adequate pro- 
vision should be made for the so-called more academic 
type of work, if at all possible. There are other 
students, however, who intend to pursue courses more 
non-academic in nature when they enter the 
higher institutions. Such courses constitute the pre- 
professional work in law, in medicine, in theology, 
in engineering, in commerce and in agriculture. No 
doubt the three-year senior high school and the two- 
year junior college should duly consider and provide 
for these pre-professional groups of students. In or- 
der to serve these groups, it is necessary for secondary 
schools, especially those having enrollments of 500 or 
more, to offer a variety of curricula and courses, or to 
provide in some definite administrative way for flexible 
or bifurcated curricula. 
Then, there is a considerable majority of students 
now—and this, no doubt, will always be more or less 
true, in actual practice, under any type of reorganized 
secondary education—who never will be able, for one 
reason or another, to enter either the science and arts 
courses of universities or the other courses offered in
-P-A-G-E-280
258 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
higher institutions of learning, but will be compelled 
to cut short their formal school training, either at the 
completion of the secondary school or even one or 
two years before such completion. To meet the social 
needs of this composite-interested and more or less 
miscellaneous group, certain suitable subject matter 
should be planned. It is at this point that the junior 
high school, with its integrating function, may assist 
very much in the solution of the problem. While the 
continuation schools have attempted to provide train- 
ing in part for those who find it impossible to remain 
in regular formal school training, much more should 
be done for these students within the regular school 
program before they are compelled to leave. 
The Current Phenomenal Increase in High School 
Enrollment.—The increase in the enrollment of the 
secondary schools of America, during more recent 
years, has been nothing short of phenomenal. It will 
be remembered that during the earlier Colonial days, 
though legislation had been passed concerning the 
establishment of grammar schools in the smaller towns 
as well as larger ones, the growth was compara- 
tively very slow. It was almost fifty years after the 
beginning of the high school movement before a rapid 
increase occurred. Accelerated growth was very 
marked during the last ten years of the nineteenth 
century. Ever since that time, this growth has not 
only been more rapid than during any previous time, 
but has also exceeded the records of any increase re- 
ported in the attendance of higher schools in any 
country of the world. During the last decade of the 
nineteenth century, the four-year high school enroll- 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
  PROBLEMS OF STUDENT POPULATION 259 
ment had reached a little over 200,000 pupils. At the 
beginning of the second decade of the twentieth cen- 
tury, about 2,000,000 pupils were enrolled. In case 
one considers the six-year high school as including the 
two upper elementary grades, the public secondary 
school enrollment is several million more. 
The above statements have had to do with the 
secondary education of the United States in toto. The 
objective evidence of the enormous increase in enroll- 
ment is somewhat more apparent in case the growth 
of individual schools, either in cities or in smaller com- 
munities, is considered. Some high schools now enroll 
from 5,000 to 8,000 pupils. In cities having a dozen or 
more high schools, it is commonly found that some of the 
separate high schools have enrollments of approxi- 
mately 4,000. In the smaller cities or towns and in 
rural sections, it is common to find that in an interval 
of ten years or more, high school enrollments have 
been doubled, or trebled, or even quadrupled. An ex- 
ample of one school only is here presented in graphic 
form to indicate what has been experienced in a 
number of communities, from 1913 to 1923, in Fig- 
ure IV. 
Much the greater number of the existing high 
schools, in the grand total, for the United States, 
are found in the rural sections. The proportion of 
high school pupils to the total number of pupils en- 
rolled in the city schools, however, is greater than the 
corresponding proportion in the small places, the 
urban high schools constituting over fifty percent of 
the total secondary school population. 
Many administrative problems grow out of the size

  PROBLEMS OF STUDENT POPULATION 261 
of high schools. The solution is in some respects 
similar, and in other respects dissimilar, in the coun- 
try and city. In the country, the problem is how to 
have the school large enough to be able to carry on 
the work in the most efficient manner, whether it be 
organized under the consolidated type, or under 
the county unit, district, township or community type. 
In any event, great precaution needs to be taken lest 
undue waste and inefficiency occur in schools too small 
to procure the best equipment and the best trained 
teachers, and lest they therefore offer in a poor man- 
ner the most helpful and suitable subject matter. In 
any high school having an enrollment of 100 pupils 
or less, certain disadvantages prevail. On the other 
hand, when a high school in a city becomes as large 
as the population of a medium-sized country town, a 
real sociological problem is encountered. When an in- 
dividual school has increased to the size of 1,000 or 
2,000, it has become a community in itself, containing, 
in potentia, most of the aspects of an incorporated 
town. This situation suggests a variety of problems 
relative to size and nature of building, variety of offer- 
ings in the curricula and social and other activities 
of the school. No final policy can be outlined, in a 
few brief words, for large high schools. It is certain, 
however, that the policies for very large and for very 
small schools must be somewhat different. It is essen- 
tial that powers be delegated to capable members 
of a large teaching staff. Certain cities also have 
planned, especially in connection with the junior high 
school idea, to limit the capacity of the school build- 
ings to about 1,000 or 1,200. The problem, too, of
-P-A-G-E-284

creating a desirable esprit de corps in.a group of pupils 
takes a different aspect, when the group numbers 
fifty, from that which it takes when the group numbers 
500, or 5,000. In rural sections, it is desirable to 
have schools with enrollments of from 200 to 500.pu- 
pils wherever at all feasible, rather than to have an 
excessive number of schools so small as to make it 
almost impossible to attract, and retain permanently, 
a teaching corps that will represent the highest type 
of experience and training. 
The Distribution and Retention of Entrants.—The 
distribution and the retention of pupils in high school 
are closely related to the nature and personnel of the 
student body, and to the total enrollment. It is an 
easy matter to represent statistically and graphi- 
eally the distribution of pupils within any high school, 
or in the high schools of the state, or in those of the 
United States as a whole. This distribution will vary 
in some degree from year to year within the same 
community, as well as between different communities. 
But, on the whole, the entrants for the freshman year 
will be represented by a distribution of a little above 
or below forty percent of the total high school 
population; the sophomore year, by approximately 
twenty-five percent; the junior year, by eighteen to 
twenty percent; and the senior year, by twelve to fif- 
teen percent. A long list of individual schools in 
different communities, considered within the same 
scholastic year, or the same individual schools during 
a long series of years, will show some variations from 
these percentages. On the other hand, as may be seen
-P-A-G-E-285
PROBLEMS OF STUDENT POPULATION 263 
from the brief set of accompanying figures, the per- 
centages are fairly representative. 
The causes of the relatively large numbers enrolled 
in the first two years of the high school are apparent. 
Each year there are many more freshman entrants 
than there are graduates. For various reasons per- 
manent withdrawals occur. Some pupils, failing to 
progress at the normal rate, remain in the first or 
second year together with the more recent entrants. 
The distribution of pupils according to years or grades 
is only a rough measure, if any, of the retention of 
pupils. All things being equal, as the relative pro- 
portion of freshman students is decreased and the 
proportion increased in the other years of the high 
school, the retention becomes greater. 
The distribution of high school pupils by years 
is not an accurate measure of the mortality or loss, 
nor of the actual retention. It does not show, for in- 
stance, the actual percentage of high school entrants 
who finally graduate, individual for individual. Some 
kind of formula should be devised for indicating the 
real amount of retention of pupils other than distri- 
bution of enrollments within the different years of the 
high schools. The problem of permanent withdraw- 
als, eighty percent or less of which occur during the 
first two years of the four-year. high school, deserves 
attention. The total percentage of failures during 
the first year or more, and the percentage of failures 
within respective school subjects, together with their 
causes, are factors that are intimately related to re- 
tention of pupils, and they are worthy of much more

QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION 
1. Discuss the relation of high school population, eligible but 
unenrolled, as well as enrolled, to the total population and its in- 
erease from decade to decade. 
2. How important are individual differences due to social 
heredity among high school pupils, as compared to differences due 
to biological heredity? 
3. How far should the occupations and industries represented 
in any high school community be known to school administrators, 
and how can this information be obtained? 
4. Discuss the virtue and possible limitations of Professor 
Counts’ method of procedure and of his generalizations relative to 
the operation of the selective principle in present-day secondary 
education.

stated by Professor Inglis and Counts. 
6. Is it practicable to provide instruction for pupils who do not 
complete the full secondary school course? Explain concretely. 
7. Procure examples of the rapid increase of high school en- 
rollments in various parts of the country. Is it possible to account 
for this phenomenal increase since 1890? Explain your answer. 
8. Indicate significant problems growing out of the size of high 
schools.

CHAPTER XIV 
REORGANIZED EDUCATION IN TERMS OF 
THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IDEA 
Introduction.—The public high school of the United 
States finally became well established toward the 
end of the nineteenth century. The reconstruction 
of certain aspects of public secondary education was 
begun in the nineties, and has continued during the, 
first quarter of the twentieth century. The junior 
high school movement has been prominent in many 
states during the last decade or more. This chap- 
ter will be confined chiefly to the junior cycle of the 
six-year secondary school, for the reason that com- 
paratively little has as yet been done to reorganize the 
senior cycle. The preparatory steps which led to the 
junior high school movement, the work of influential 
committees, the arguments in favor of reorganization, 
the non-eight-four plans of organization, the North 
Central Association tentative standards, the general 
nature of subjects, some representative schools, diffi- 
culties and future policies will be discussed in brief. 
The Junior High School Idea or Spirit of Reorgan- 
ization.—Many misgivings have been expressed from 
time to time by crities of the junior high school move- 
ment ever since the term or phrase appeared in edu- 
cational literature. School fads have been so common 
267 Ss 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  
  268 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
that such doubts are not at all surprising. Whenever 
any attempt is made, however, to bring about needed 
reforms in any field there is some advantage in 
giving such a movement some definite caption under 
which it becomes possible to catalog its outstanding 
characteristics. The phrase ‘‘junior high school 
movement’’ should represent above all a spirit, or com- 
posite idea, fundamental in the recasting of one of 
the important cycles of the public school system. 
There is not likely ever to be such an institution 
as the junior high school in America. A dictionary 
definition of this institution is of little value. It is 
more satisfactory to suggest the features and func- 
tions of the junior high school. It should include all 
of the desirable reform features of the seventh, eighth, 
and ninth grades, at least. 
Preparatory Steps from 1890 to 1910.—All organ- 
ized movements which have become perfected in any 
field can be traced back to a number of pioneer efforts 
and indirect tendencies. This has been true in the 
ease of constitutional history and other important 
phases of history. The same can be said of the great 
outstanding literary movements. The statement is 
true also of certain fundamental aspects of natural 
science. It is, likewise, no less true in the instance of 
the final expression of institutions in the history of el- 
ementary and secondary education. As has already 
been pointed out, the humanistic and realistic tenden- 
cies so dominantly in the foreground of secondary ed- 
ucation during the nineteenth century had been gather- 
ing momentum in a more or less definite way for many 
years. The junior high school movement in its present
-P-A-G-E-291
THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IDEA 269 
form is the combined result of the work of many com- 
mittees covering several decades or more. 
As early as 1888, President Eliot of Harvard had 
outlined a plan of school reform before the Depart- 
ment of Superintendence of the National Education 
Association. In two respects, he had anticipated the 
general problem of reorganization, namely, with refer- 
ence to the economy of time, and with reference to 
the reconstruction of the subject matter taught. 
The Report of the Committee of Ten, made in 1893 
under the auspices of the National Educational As- 
sociation, was referred to, in a general way, in an 
earlier chapter. This committee outlined suggestions 
with reference both to the content and to the length 
of secondary education. Some of its discussions bore 
directly, and others only indirectly, on the junior high 
school cycle. The main purpose of secondary schools, 
according to the committee, was preparation for the 
duties of life, as contrasted to preparation for col- 
leges; choice of subjects was regarded as relatively 
insignificant since all subjects, in its opinion, had about 
equal value; introductory work in most of the prin- 
cipal subjects should be offered preliminary to the 
four-year high school; and, in a four-year high school, 
the study of mathematics, natural science and foreign 
languages should be begun earlier, or else the second- 
ary school should be made six years instead of four 
in length. The report of the Committee of Fifteen 
recommended, with some reservation, the inclusion of 
practical arts, the modification of algebra and English 
in the seventh and eighth grades, the use of depart- 
mental teaching and more flexible promotion. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  270 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Committee on College Entrance Requirements, in 
agreement with the Committee of Ten, but in dis- 
agreement with the Committee of Fifteen, recom- 
mended, in 1899, a six-year secondary school, not 
divided into units. 
Influence of Committees after 1910—The Depart- 
ment of Secondary Education of the National Educa- 
tion Association in 1910 indirectly helped to prepare 
the way for junior high school reorganization by call- 
ing attention to provision for different pupil ca- 
pacities, for permitting tentative choices of vocations 
and for the inclusion of practical arts. The discus- 
sions of the Committee on the Articulation of High 
Schools and Colleges in 1911 re-emphasized, indirectly 
also, the later issues of the junior-senior high school. 
Beginning with the year 1912 the Commission on 
the Reorganization of Secondary Education issued a 
series of more than a dozen reports which discuss the 
six-year high school in terms of the two unit-cycles. 
Some of the later bulletins outline the work in the 
separate school subjects suitable for the junior and 
senior cycles respectively. The Committee on Hcon- 
omy of Time in 1913 distinctly recognized the so-called 
horizontal or latitudinal divisions and units of the 
secondary six-year school, in terms of the junior high 
school extending from the twelfth year of the pupil 
to the fifteenth year, and of the senior high school 
extending from the fifteenth year to the eighteenth 
year. Renewed emphasis was placed upon the prac- 
tical studies for those likely to be interested in later 
vocations as well as upon the need of offering a longer 
period of general training to all pupils than was cus-
-P-A-G-E-293
THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IDEA 271 
tomary under the older plan. The direct and in- 
direct influences of the committees mentioned and of 
other factors tend to strengthen one’s conviction that 
the junior high school movement had been gathering 
strength in a variety of ways and through a period 
of years. 
The reports of the North Central Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools since 1918 have given 
a brief résumé of the status of the junior high schools. 
The tentative standards of the junior high school ac- 
cording to a statement published in 1923 by this 
association are briefly summarized below. First, with 
reference to a composite functional definition, they 
are as follows: 
1. A unit system consisting of grades seven, eight and nine 
2. Organized and administered as a unit by a separate staff of 
principals and teachers 
3. Flexible promotion whenever expedient for the good of the 
pupil versus promotion by grade or subject 
4. Provision for exploratory courses during the earlier semesters 
5. Provision for limited election during later semesters 
Second with reference to the program of studies, 
the standards are these: 
1. Appropriate subjects are English, mathematics, foreign lan- 
guage, history and civics, geography and elementary science, music 
and other fine arts, health education and vocational and practical 
arts including commercial subjects 
2. Use of single curriculum with limited electives 
a, Exploratory and try-out courses in the first semester and 
one-half ‘ 
b. No electives advised prior to the second semester of the 
eighth grade  
-P-A-G-E-294
  272 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
3. Departmentalized instruction 
4, Provision for directed extra-curricular or correlated activities 
Third, with reference to an alternate system of college 
entrance requirements where the non-eight-four plan 
is in operation, they are: 
1. Under the traditional four-year plan, the fifteen units require- 
ment should remain in use 
2. Under the new plan, not more than twelve units required, these 
‘to be earned in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades. At least 
nine of the twelve units must be in academic subjects 
Beginning of the Organized Movement about 1910. 
—Departmentalization of instruction is almost uni- 
versally suggested as an earmark of a real junior 
high school. It is known, however, that department- 
alized instruction had become the practice during 
the last decade of the nineteenth century, and during 
the first decade of the twentieth, throughout the coun- 
try. This was most often true in the last grade of 
the elementary school, the eighth grade in the North- 
ern states. Sometimes, it was customary also to com- 
bine one or more grades under the departmentalized 
plan. In one respect it may be said that department- 
alization prepared the way for junior high school 
work. 
There is some doubt as to which of several cities 
may claim priority in the actual beginning of this re- 
organized work. Four cities, Columbus, Berkeley, Los 
Angeles, and Concord, N. H., claim to have established 
this newer institution about 1910. No complete state- 
ment of the growth of junior high schools during the 
next ten years after the first ones were established
-P-A-G-E-295
THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IDEA 273 
is here attempted. Over 1,000 of these schools, good, 
bad and indifferent, exist now (1924-1925) and the 
median years for their establishment in states where 
the growth was most rapid are those between 1915 
and 1920. In a limited study made of forty schools 
organized in the state of Kansas, the median year 
was 1917, and for about an equal number of schools 
established in Indiana, the median year was 1916. 
Authentic reports, a few years ago, showed consider- 
ably over 500 cities, with populations of 2,500 and 
over, having junior high schools. The total number 
of junior high schools reported by the United States 
Bureau of Education in September, 1923, according 
to replies received by superintendents of cities having 
populations of 2,500 and over, was 723. This list is 
incomplete since not all of the 1,500 city superin- 
tendents to whom questionnaires were sent made re- 
plies, nor did the 456 superintendents who did reply 
give the complete number of schools in all of their 
cities. At the present time, the statistics for the past 
fifteen years, if they were available, would indicate 
that the movement has grown to such proportions that 
it must be recognized as one of the significant phases 
of reorganized secondary education during the first 
quarter of the twentieth century. 
Unification through the American Educational Lad- 
der.—In America an educational ladder presumably 
now exists. It has not always been so. At first no 
vital relation existed between the elementary schools 
and the Latin grammar schools. Later on, undesign- 
edly,-the high school was built into the system. Dur- 
ing the latter half of the nineteenth century the most
-P-A-G-E-296
274 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
common form of educational ladder consisted of the 
eight-year elementary school, the four-year high school, 
and the four-year college. In recent times, an ad- 
justable ladder made up of unit sections has been de- 
vised in order to meet different social needs. The 
most frequently used unit of organization of the mod- 
ern elementary school consists of the first six grades. 
The next unit or section of the ladder consists most 
often of either the seventh and eighth, or else of the 
seventh, eighth and ninth grades; the next, of the 
tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades; and the last, of 
the thirteenth and fourteenth grades. According to 
such an idea as this, the ideal American educational 
ladder would have no abrupt or cataclysmic breaks in 
it from the beginning of the kindergarten, on through 
the first six grades of the elementary school, through 
the junior-senior high school and on through at 
least the junior college. In a limited number of com- 
munities in the United States, the above ideal is now 
being realized at public expense. 
As will be repeated later on, one of the ardent claims 
made in favor of the junior high school is the fact 
that it bridges over one of the most important mor- 
tality gaps or breaks in the school system. That is, 
in actual practice, pupils tend to leave the educational 
ladder in larger numbers at some points than at 
others. Under the traditional eight-four plan, pupils 
leave in especially large numbers between the fifth and 
sixth grades; then, previous to or at the end of the 
eighth grade; and again, in large numbers, during the 
first two years of the four-year secondary school. 
Moreover, of those remaining until high school grad-
-P-A-G-E-297
  THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IDEA 275 
uation, only comparatively few enter college. With 
some hope of more nearly unifying all of the years of 
a student’s education from the beginning to the end, 
this new elementary-junior-senior-high-school-junior- 
college public education ladder has been constructed. 
One of the chief problems with which school admin- 
istrators have been confronted is that of the mere 
duplication and overlapping of subject matter taught. 
In earlier Colonial days, when it was customary for 
Latin grammar schools to have attached to them 
preparatory courses, the usual separate elementary 
schools duplicated certain subjects of secondary edu- 
cation. Later on the same was true of elementary 
schools as compared with academies and high schools. 
Up to this day, duplication occurs in the work offered 
in high schools and the higher institutions of learn- 
ing. 
The principle of unity was discussed in general in 
an earlier chapter. The application of it to the junior- 
senior high school involves the codperation of school 
officers in the determination of objectives, both gen- 
eral and specific, for the school as a whole, as well 
as for the respective subjects taught; in the formu- 
lation of the content of subject matter; in the methods 
of presentation of subject matter to pupils; in the 
social control of pupils in correlated school activities ; 
and in the external organization of the school into 
closely related unit cycles. 
Types of External OrganizationA dozen or more 
forms of external organization of junior high schools 
may be found in existence throughout the country as 
a whole. Usually more than one grade or year is
-P-A-G-E-298
  276 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
included, though here and there the seventh grade, or 
sometimes the eighth, constitutes the entire scope of 
organization. Wherever the eighth grade alone is 
included, the school is probably the remnant of a 
previously’ departmentalized eighth grade. In the 
regions where the eight-four plan is most commonly 
found, the junior high school is most frequently con- 
stituted either of the seventh and eighth grades or 
else of the seventh, eighth and ninth. In some states, 
one of these forms predominates, and in other states 
another form. In 1923, the United States Bureau 
of Education reported five cities of 100,000 population 
and over as having the seventh, eighth and ninth grade 
type of organization in a total of 55 schools. Some 
of the cities were noncommittal as to their form of 
organization. But it may be observed in the tabu- 
lated groups of cities with populations over 100,000, 
between 30,000 and 100,000, and between 10,000 and 
30,000, respectfully, that the seventh, eighth and ninth 
grade plan of organization is very prominently repre- 
sented. Practically the only other type of organiza- 
tion appearing in these same cities is the seventh and 
eighth gradetype. Other forms that have been used toa 
much more limited degree are those in which the 
seventh grade alone, the eighth grade alone, the sixth, 
seventh and eighth grades combined or the eighth 
and ninth grades combined, appear. The six-six plan 
is not technically considered, a junior-senior high 
school organization. The six-year secondary school 
is a unit cycle without subdivisions. However, as 
‘previously suggested, it is possible for this type of 
secondary school, as well as for a four-year school, to
-P-A-G-E-299
THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IDEA 277 
carry out many of the fundamental principles of the 
junior-senior high school organization. 
In some of the larger cities, where a half dozen or 
more junior high schools exist, it is customary to 
allow considerable freedom in the matter of the exact 
form or type of organization. In such instances, it 
is possible to have several different types within one 
city, depending upon the local conditions and con- 
veniences. In the legislation of certain states, pro- 
vision has been made for either the six-three-three, or 
else the six-two-four plan in the larger communities, 
and for the six-six plan in the more rural communities. 
This latter provision, for example, is the one made in 
Indiana. Justifiable reasons exist for asserting that 
for the United States as a whole the six-three-three 
policy is the most desirable. In certain states, legis- 
lation already passed makes it difficult to establish 
this plan. This is true at the present time in Illinois 
because of the four-year township and community high 
schools. 
The Usual Claims and Arguments Made for Reor- 
ganization.—In 1916, a three-fold list of general argu- 
ments in favor of the junior high school was given by 
Douglass. In summary, his first contention was that 
the reorganized form is better psychologically because 
it recognizes the mental traits possessed by pupils, 
because it appropriately begins certain studies, such 
as foreign languages, at twelve rather than at four- 
teen years of age, and because it provides courses 
which meet individual differences. In the second 
place, he argued, it is more economical in the adminis- 
tration of the learning process of pupils; and in the
-P-A-G-E-300
    278 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
third place, it is more democratic in providing for 
an equal opportunity for all pupils in attendance. 
These contentions were all put forth as representing 
advantages of the junior high school plan over the 
usual eight-four plan as administered, and in one form 
or another these three general arguments have been 
reproduced frequently since that time by many 
writers. 
Briggs listed claims as follows: First, in terms of 
administrative advantages, classes of normal size, 
differentiation of curricula, departmental teaching and 
promotion by subject are made easier; second, the 
junior high school makes reforms in curricular and 
extra-curricular practices more likely; third, better 
teachers are developed; and fourth, provision is made 
for individual differences with reference to ability of 
pupils and with reference to prospective vocations. 
Koos’s list, published in 1921, made the following 
claims in terms of the functions of the junior high 
school: First, the realization of a democratic school 
system through the retention of pupils, economy of 
time, recognition of individual differences, exploration 
for guidance and vocational guidance; second, recogni- 
tion of the general psychological nature of pupils; 
third, improvement of teaching; fourth, improvement 
of scholarship; fifth, improvement of socializing op- 
portunities; sixth, hastening of desirable reforms in 
the grades above and those below the junior high 
school, as well as in the Junior high school itself. 
Relative Importance of the Program of Studies.—It 
is difficult to emphasize too strongly the significance 
of the reorganization of the content of subjects, to-
-P-A-G-E-301
THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IDEA 279 
gether with reconstruction of the methods of teaching 
these subjects in the junior high school. Some writers 
insist, with large justification, that the chief deter- 
minative aspect of the nature and character of the 
school is to be found in the nature and organization of 
the program of studies. The purposes of the inter- 
mediate or junior high school must be realized prima- 
rily through the teaching of suitable subjects. Pur- | 
poses emphasized by Briggs and others are as follows: 
Supplying a common body of integrating knowledge to 
all pupils in attendance both through curricular, and 
through correlated, or often so-called extra-curricular, 
activities; second, the discovery of, and provision for, 
the assured future needs of pupils; third, the explora- 
tion of the interests and aptitudes of pupils through 
genuinely realistic curricular materials; fourth, the in- 
troduction of pupils to the major ‘‘trunk-lines’’ of 
learning; fifth, the assisting of pupils in selecting, 
tentatively, satisfactory life careers. 
The following will serve as a general working policy. 
In terms of content, at least five large groups of sub- 
jects representative of the significant modes of human 
experience should be included. The groups should be 
constituted of language, English and foreign; history 
and other social studies; elementary aspects of nat- 
ural science and mathematics; practical arts; and fine 
arts. Closely connected with these curricular aspects 
should be organized and directed health activities, and 
other correlated school activities. 
Pennsylvania Representative of Reorganized Prac- 
tices.—The State of Pennsylvania serves as one ex- 
ample of attempts to reorganize the program of studies
-P-A-G-E-302
    280 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
as a whole, including its four characteristic stages and 
criteria. In the reorganized program of 1922, four 
stages are suggested, namely: (a) adjustment, cover- 
ing the lower seventh grade, representing a gradual 
transition with little if any election; (b) exploration 
and preview, covering the upper seventh grade and 
lower eighth, with short try-out courses in introduc- 
_ tory natural science, introductory social studies, and 
some pre-vocational studies; (¢) provisional choice 
of electives in the upper eighth grade; (d) stimulation, 
continuance of electives begun in the previous stage 
and gradual transition to the senior high school. 
Individual Junior High School Practices Worthy of 
Detailed Study.—It is possible to attempt to evaluate 
the significance of the junior high school movement to 
some degree in terms of the gross number of institu- 
tions established. It is perhaps even more important 
to make a detailed analysis and study of the practices 
of the leading typical junior high schools of the coun- 
try. Certain committees are now at work in an at- 
tempt to collect on a much larger scale than ever be- 
fore, the standards, materials and practices used in 
the better junior high schools of the country. Recent 
monographs and magazine articles serve as a profit- 
able source of study and means of investigating cur- 
rent practices. The personnel of the pupil groups, the 
size of the school, the nature of the curricula offered, 
provision for vocational instruction, vocational guid- 
ance, individual instruction and supervised study, the 
articulation of junior and senior high schools, pro- 
vision for different groups according to ability, cor- 
relation of school activities, provision for health activ-
-P-A-G-E-303
THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IDEA 281 
ity and physical training are some of the topics which 
have been treated, with reference to such schools as 
those of Montclair, New Jersey; the Ben Blewett 
school in St. Louis; and Washington Junior High 
School in Rochester, New York. A wealth of material 
is now available in printed form from such large city 
school systems as those of Detroit, Cleveland and Los 
Angeles, and from such smaller ones as those of South 
Bend, Indiana, and Jackson, Michigan. 
Junior High School Buildings and Their Location.— 
It is impossible to enter into any detailed statement 
concerning junior high school buildings and their loca- 
tion. A very common practice, even in large cities, 
has been to use a part of another building or to use an 
old, more or less dilapidated senior high school build- 
ing which has been vacated. The size of a school will 
necessarily determine the size of the building. The 
policy of Detroit in limiting the capacity of a building 
to approximately 1,200 pupils is worthy of considera- 
tion. This, of course, may not be feasible in all in- 
stances. The most desirable location of the building 
in towns of over 20,000 is one that is central in relation 
to the five or six elementary school buildings, and, if 
possible, in proximity to the senior high school build- 
ing. In towns of 50,000 or more, it is most desirable 
to locate buildings at three or four central points with 
groups of elementary schools surrounding. In any 
event, buildings should be so constructed as to assist 
in realizing the outstanding purposes of the school in 
terms of the types of subjects taught and the activities 
carried on. 
Junior High School Teachers.—One of the difficulties
-P-A-G-E-304
  282 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to be met in the junior high school movement is that 
most teachers have not studied this newly created in- 
stitution as such, and therefore are likely to simply 
transfer to junior high school teaching the methods 
they have used in some other part of the school system, 
in case they are experienced teachers. In the event 
they chance to be inexperienced, they have made no 
study of the theory of the institution. With reference 
to the needed qualifications and training, the standard 
should, if possible, be no lower than that of the senior 
high school, since both the junior and senior cycles are 
regarded as parts of the six-year unit of secondary ed- 
ucation. Naturally, if preparation equal to that of 
the senior high school teacher is to be demanded, the 
salaries should be favorably comparable, and in many 
instances similar, if not in all. 
Future Policies and Practices of the Intermediate 
and Junior High School.—The problems of the city of 
New York with its forty or more junior high schools 
will necessarily differ in some respects from the 
problems of Cleveland, Detroit or Los Angeles with 
the contemplated score of junior high schools which 
each contemplate establishing. The problems of these 
cities will, in turn, differ somewhat from those of the 
smaller communities which have but one junior high 
school, or a few such schools. In certain cities the 
programs of study in all of the different junior high 
schools are varied to meet the different needs of com- 
munities. The practice with reference to elective sub- 
jects for the whole country is about as follows: Little, 
if any, election during the first year, and increased
-P-A-G-E-305
THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IDEA 283 
election during the latter part of the eighth grade and 
during the ninth grade. 
General Evaluation of the Reorganization of Grades 
Seven, Eight and Nine.—Frequent arguments against 
the junior high school plan have appeared. Among 
these are: It is more expensive; specialization is 
likely to be encouraged too early; pupils are too imma- 
ture at this age to do satisfactory work under the 
departmentalized plan; drill is likely to be under- 
estimated because of highly motivated work; state 
legislation in some sections is unfavorable; subject 
matter is often indefinitely organized; teachers have 
not been trained for this newer approach; and text- 
books, buildings and equipment are often ill-adapted. 
One blanket answer to most of these objections is that 
the most efficient schools will justify themselves on the 
basis of superior results or products. 
Where the policies of the junior high school have 
been clearly worked out, its purposes and functions 
have been pretty well realized. In far too many in- 
stances, so-called reorganized practices have been in 
the nature of camouflage. Schools have been called 
junior or intermediate without much forethought or 
reflection before their establishment. This weakness 
has been offset in part by the efficient work done in the 
several dozen outstanding institutions of the kind in 
the country. It is necessary to use much precaution 
in accepting the claims made by the junior high school 
in terms of increased retention of pupils, or increased 
promotion practices, or supervised study or the intro- 
duction of vocational subjects and vocational guidance.
-P-A-G-E-306
  284 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
‘Whatever may be the acknowledged limitations of the 
Junior high school, it is obvious that through it and in 
its name, certain purposes, subject matter and prac- 
tices have been initiated which otherwise might have 
been delayed for some time to some.

CHAPTER XV 
REORGANIZED SECONDARY EDUCATION IN 
TERMS OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IDEA 
Introduction.—Peculiarly enough, within the last 
two decades, both the junior high school and the junior 
college have come into existence in the United States. 
What about the intermediate unit or section of our 
American educational ladder which now exists between 
these two junior institutions? So far, modification 
relative to the aims and content of the subject matter 
has not been sufficient, either in case of the three-year 
senior high school or of the four-year traditional high 
school, to justify characterizing this intermediate unit 
as an outstanding movement or idea. That is to say, 
more vigorous efforts, so far, have been made to re- 
construct the nature of the American educational lad- 
der both immediately above and below the senior high 
school than within it. In how rapid a manner this 
educational dilemma will be solved or removed, it is, 
perhaps, not possible to say. The chief purpose of the 
present discussion is not to answer this question 
directly but to call attention to several phases of that 
unit of the secondary school system now designated as 
the junior college. In such highly centralized ad- 
ministrations of school systems as those existing in 
France and Germany, the educational dilemma men- 
287
-P-A-G-E-310
288 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tioned above could not possibly have developed. By 
edict, the whole of the educational ladder would have 
been changed at once, either for good or for ill. It is 
obvious that if the junior high school and junior col- 
lege ideas in America are to bring about a genuine re- 
organized procedure, the unit of the secondary school 
system between these so-called two junior institutions 
will also need to undergo considerable modification. 
That is to say, reorganization once begun will neces- 
sarily need to run its full course throughout all of 
the units of the educational ladder in order to be most 
effective. 
The Scope of Secondary Education—As has been 
true in European countries, so, at times, in America 
the scope and definition of secondary education have 
been stated in terms of the school subjects to be pur- 
sued. For example, W. T. Harris, one-time Commis- 
sioner of Education of the United States, based his 
definition of secondary education upon the nature of 
subjects pursued. Students who studied the classical 
languages, algebra, geometry, natural sciences and 
European history were regarded according to such a 
definition as being in the province of the secondary 
school, providing at least three such subjects were be- 
ing pursued. Due to the fact that ‘‘historically the 
limits of secondary education are shadowy and vari- 
able,’’? and that it undesignedly ‘‘got wedged in be- 
tween the elementary school and college,’’ it at times 
has been roughly defined ‘‘as a higher stage than that 
of the elementary school and lower than that of in- 
stitutions authorized to give academic degrees.’’ 
Again, the question has been raised as to what shall
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IDEA 289 
be the province of secondary education in terms of 
the number of years to be included. Should pupils 
begin their secondary education at twelve, or at four- 
teen, years of age? And to what ages, respectively, 
shall it be extended? Shall six years be given to it, 
irrespective of the beginning or entrance age? Three 
answers to this query now exist in practice. The 
traditional answer, in the majority of the states, has 
been the four-year high school. One form of non- 
traditional answer is to be found in the inclusion of 
the grades from the seventh to the twelfth. Another 
form of non-traditional answer is the inclusion of the 
first two years of the liberal arts and science colleges. 
As indicated, attempts have been made to define 
secondary education in terms of school subjects, in 
terms of age-limits of pupils, in terms of a vaguely 
characterized intermediate link between elementary 
and higher education and, more recently, in terms of 
the capacities and needs of pupils. Perhaps the tend- 
ency most common at present is to try to determine the 
functions of secondary education. 
Historical Development.—Semblances of junior col- 
leges appeared in a very limited number of instances 
previous to 1900, and this was true only of a few pri- 
vate institutions. During the ten years which fol- 
lowed, about a dozen more were organized, all of which 
were also private except one. After 1910, and up to 
the present time, the growth has been considerably 
more rapid, being an average of more than ten per 
year, the total of all types being more than 200 at the 
present time. The great majority of these developed 
between 1915 and 1925, between two-thirds and three-
-P-A-G-E-312
  290 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
fourths of the total number having been established 
since 1915. The growth has not been phenomenal at 
any one time, but considering the conversatism of 
higher institutions of learning as well as of secondary 
schools, it has been rather surprisingly rapid. 
Representative Types of External Organization.— 
Four types of junior colleges now exist. First, there 
is the expanded public high school, or the free public 
junior college. Second, there is the two-year, in- 
dependent, private type. Third, there is the state or 
public higher institution type, usually in connection 
with normal teachers’ colleges. Fourth, there is the 
hyphenated junior-senior college or ingrained higher 
institution or university type, which includes the first 
two years above the senior high school, or the two 
years immediately below the senior college. 
The Expanded or Prolonged Public High School.— 
All forms or types of junior colleges presumably in- 
clude two years beyond the equivalent of four years of 
secondary school work. Only one public junior col- 
lege is known to have existed previous to 1910. Since 
that time, approximately fifty of these have been 
established. Joliet is reported to have organized its 
Junior College in 1902. This institution is represen- 
tative of the colleges having enrollments of between 
100 and 200 students, of which there are approximately 
a dozen throughout the country at the present time. 
The entrance requirement of Joliet Junior College 
is similar to that of other higher institutions in the 
North Central Association territory, namely, fifteen 
units. The prescribed subjects are similar to those in

the first two years’ work of the University of Illinois. 
To quote from the bulletin issued in September, 1922, 
“The Junior College curriculums are advisedly out- 
lined with special regard for the entrance requirements 
of the University of Illinois, but are intended to give 
the broad substantial foundation required to do suc- 
cessful work of a specialized nature in any higher 
institution.’’ 
The city of Joliet is a typical industrial center; con- 
sequently, the relative percentage of high school 
graduates who later go on to college is considerably 
lower than is the case in a non-industrial, residential 
community. Six curricula are announced by the junior 
college, as follows: Literature and arts, engineering, 
pre-medical, pre-legal, pre-commerce and_teacher- 
training. To quote from the bulletin, again, these 
‘‘are all basic substantial courses designed to give gen- 
eral training in their respective fields of education, 
and at the same time, prepare specifically for the ad- 
vanced professional and technical curriculums.’’ 
A paraphrased list of benefits of Joliet Junior Col- 
lege, published by the college, is here given for pur- 
poses of comparison with the claims made for, and 
the announced functions of, the junior colleges 
throughout the whole country: (1) The expense of 
going to college is very materially reduced in com- 
parison to that involved in attendance of a college 
away from home; (2) educationally considered, due to 
smaller classes, and to closer contact with instructors, 
more individual attention can be given to first-year 
students, than is true in case of the freshman students
-P-A-G-E-314
  292 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
in the large universities; (3) the transition from high 
school to college spirit and social activities is gradual; 
(4) students have an opportunity to become more 
mature before leaving their home environment; (5) 
some students are enabled and inspired to go beyond 
the high school who might easily otherwise cut short 
their education at the end of the high school. 
A. typical institution representing a large urban 
community is to be found in Crane Junior College, 
Chicago, Illinois, which was founded by the order of 
the city Board of Education, in the year 1911, as an 
integral part of the city public school system. The ad- 
mission requirement to Crane Junior College is fifteen 
units of standard work as defined by the North Central 
Association. Students are given credit at the Uni- 
versity of Illinois on a par with those students who at- 
tend the University itself for the first two years. The 
work of students is also given due credit at the Uni- 
versities of Michigan and Wisconsin and the Univer- 
sity of Chicago. 
Five types of curricula are offered: Literature and 
arts, science, engineering, pre-medical and commerce 
and business administration. This college is represen- 
tative of institutions having enrollments of 500 to 
1,000 students. Recent steps have been taken to re- 
organize the institution so as to enable it to offer four 
years of work rather than two. This tendency in 
other large cities, such as Detroit and Kansas City, 
creates the possibility of the tendency to develop in 
the United States a limited number of municipal uni- 
versities, in which students will be enabled to secure 
four years of higher education free of charge. The
-P-A-G-E-315
THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IDEA 293 
two institutions described have been chosen as repre- 
sentative of a medium-sized community and of a large 
urban center, respectively. 
In the catalogs of other junior colleges the following 
representative purposes and statements concerning 
courses may be found: Foundation courses requiring 
academic prerequisities and leading to two years of 
general training toward a degree in a university; two 
years of preparatory work leading to the professional 
courses offered in the universities; and vocational and 
practical courses not necessarily leading to a higher 
degree, but primarily for those persons not intending 
to continue their higher education in universities. 
From such statements it seems clear that an attempt 
is made to provide differentiated work for all classes 
of entrants. 
In general, it may be said that the expanded public 
high school type of junior college gradually came into 
existence because of local demands for further formal 
schooling beyond the high school. In a number of in- 
stances, to meet such a demand, so-called post-graduate 
courses, one year in length, were organized, and most 
frequently conducted or housed in the high school 
buildings. The same spirit of eagerness which led 
to the prolongation of the public elementary school 
beyond the public secondary school has led individuals 
in various local situations to advocate the prolongation 
of public secondary education beyond the four-year 
high school. 
Résumé of the Other Three Types.—The independ- 
ent, or private junior college type developed earliest, 
and junior colleges of this type are now found to be
-P-A-G-E-316
    294 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
most numerous. While the public junior colleges are 
all coeducational institutions, in many instances the 
private are not. The majority of them are associated 
with denominational institutions of higher learning. 
The chief impetus or occasion for the development of 
this type was the attempt to meet the standards neces- 
sary to maintain higher institutions of learning. In 
some instances, they represent decapitated or ab- 
breviated four-year colleges of the liberal arts and 
science type. Necessarily, the type connected with 
state normal colleges has a somewhat different em- 
phasis tending, on the whole, to include more of the 
non-academic subject matter, and to stress the pre- 
professional aspect of teaching. The first two junior 
colleges of the ingrained university type were organ- 
ized, in the nineties, in the University of California 
and the University of Chicago respectively. Since 
that time, four other institutions have adopted this 
type of junior-senior college organization, namely, 
the University of Washington, The University of Min- 
nesota, Stanford University and the University of 
Nebraska. Junior colleges of this engrafted univer- 
sity type have multiplied least rapidly of any. 
William Rainey Harper, one-time president of the 
University of Chicago, and later, James Roland Angell, 
now president of Yale University, were enthusiastic 
proponents of this plan in the University of Chicago. 
Henry P. Tappan, one-time president of the University 
of Michigan, and President-Emeritus William W. Fol- 
well of the University of Minnesota, soon after the 
middle of the nineteenth century, had discussed in 
some detail the nature of the general and pre-profes- 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IDEA 295 
sional work to be offered by colleges. These discus- 
sions, no doubt, prepared the way for the later work 
done by William Rainey Harper, Edmund J. James, 
David Starr Jordan and others relative to the junior 
college idea as entrenched within the four-year uni- 
versity. 
Legislation in California—In California, state legis- 
lation was passed in 1907 enabling high school dis- 
tricts to add two years of work to the traditional 
four-year high school course. Sixteen public junior 
colleges are reported to have been established in the 
state during the ten years from 1913 to 1922 inclusive. 
During the last two or three years, a half dozen or 
more junior colleges have been established in connec- 
tion with state teacher-training institutions. The 
public junior college, however, has multiplied more 
rapidly in California than in any other state. Mich- 
igan and Minnesota probably follow next in order of 
the number established. 
Standardization in Missouri—An outstanding ex- 
ample of the attempt to standardize junior colleges is 
to be found in the instance of the State of Missouri. 
The state university cooperated through inspection of 
these colleges by members of the faculty. Contrari- 
wise to the situation in California, private junior col- 
leges have multiplied more rapidly in the State of 
Missouri than other types, sixteen at least being 
established between 1911 and 1919 inclusive. In Ken. 
tucky, Tennessee, Virginia and Texas, the private type 
has increased more rapidly than the others. 
Standards of the North Central Association —Tenta- 
tive standards of accrediting junior colleges have been
-P-A-G-E-318
  296 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
set forth by the North Central Association of Colleges 
and Secondary Schools with reference to the length of 
the curriculum, scholastic requirement of instructors, 
' teaching load of instructors, entrance requirement of 
students, the number enrolled and the material equip- 
ment. In 1923, a standard junior college was defined 
by this association as ‘‘an institution with a curriculum 
covering two years of collegiate work, which is based 
upon and continues or supplements the work of 
secondary instruction as given in an accredited four- 
year high school’. The entrance requirement was 
stipulated as ‘‘fifteen units of high school work’’. The 
minimum scholastic requirement of instructors ‘‘shall 
be graduation from a college belonging to this associa- 
tion or an equivalent, and in addition, graduate work 
in a University of recognized standing amounting to 
one year’’. Institutions offering but a single year’s 
work must enroll at least twenty students, and those 
offering two years’ work, at least fifty students. Un- 
der the ‘‘list of accredited institutions of higher educa- 
tion, 1923’’, the names of a total of twenty-four junior 
colleges appeared. The most comprehensive general 
list now available of the various types of junior col- 
leges, standardized and non-standardized, reputed to 
be in existence throughout all of the states is to be 
found in Appendix A, of Volume II of Professor 
Koos’s report on the junior college. 
Summary of Claims for, and Functions of, the Junior 
College.—Professor Koos has listed twenty-one pur- 
poses of the junior college under the following five 
generic or group headings, namely, of the nature of

Adaptation to local needs 
The cultural aspect 
The above list is given chiefly for the purpose of 
contrasting the present situation with that of the 
claims summarized a decade ago. A summary of 
claims announced in printed form by a junior college 
of California, in 1914, was, in substance, as follows: 
Advantages to the immature pupil, who may remain at 
home longer; to the one who cannot afford financially 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
ee ee ee 
298 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to live away from the home community ; to the one who 
falls short in some respect with reference to college 
entrance, but who is worthy of a further opportunity 
to do advanced study; and to the one who prefers to 
pursue study along other lines than those offered 
within senior colleges. 
A summary of the arguments which have frequently 
appeared from time to time is here given. The list, 
which does not represent.the order or percentage of 
frequency, is as follows: The junior college reduces 
financial expenditure to a minimum; it provides for 
pupils in home environment during immature years; 
it gives an opportunity for a larger number of pupils 
to receive a prolonged education; it tends to adapt sub- 
ject matter to the local needs of pupils; it induces more 
pupils to continue beyond the high school; it provides 
opportunity for improved methods of instruction; it 
relieves the congestion, especially in the freshman 
year, of the large universities; and it provides for pre- 
professional, as well as for general, training. 
One purpose of giving this array of purposes and 
functions is to call attention to the fact that an in- 
creasingly consistent effort has been made to analyze 
in considerable detail the justification for the creating 
of this junior college unit of the school system. It 
it impossible to make a detailed discussion of these 
purposes at this point. This has been done by Pro- 
fessor Koos in his report, especially in Volume I. He 
has summarized in tabular form the percentages of 
statements given to the various purposes as found in 
literature on junior colleges, in public junior college 
catalogs and in private junior college catalogs. With
-P-A-G-E-321
  THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IDEA 299 
reference to the purpose of ‘‘offering two years of 
work acceptable to colleges and universities’’ the per- 
centage of statements from literature is 68.2; from 
public junior college catalogs, 97.7; and from private 
junior college catalogs, 93.9. With reference to ‘‘com- 
pleting education of students not going on’’, the 
percentages from each of the above sources are respec- 
tively, 45.5, 21.7 and 12.11. With reference to ‘‘provid- 
ing occupational training of-junior college grade’’, the 
percentages are 54.5, 52.2 and 48.5; with reference to 
“affording attention to the individual student’’ the 
percentages are 36.4, 21.7 and 30.3. So much of this 
statistical result has been given in order to point out 
the fact that in part, at least, the junior college, both 
private and public, is emphasizing other aspects in 
secondary education than merely academic training, 
and that an attempt is being made to provide for the 
prolongation of secondary education in case of all 
groups of students, so far as possible. 
The Adaptation of Curricular Offerings to the 
Avowed Purposes.—It is of some interest to raise the 
question as to how far the actual curricular offerings 
of the junior colleges harmonize with the avowed pur- 
poses set up by them. McDowell’s findings, in his 
survey of between forty and fifty institutions, were in 
substance as follows: The traditional college subjects 
for the freshman and sophomore years tended to per- 
sist in terms of English, history, mathematics and 
foreign languages. As to foreign language, Latin 
predominated in the private institutions, but was sup- 
plemented liberally with modern languages in the 
public colleges. The tendency of the public college
-P-A-G-E-322
  300 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
was to offer a wide range of subject matter with in- 
creasing emphasis upon vocational and pre-profes- 
sional work. Professor Koos in his study of the 
nature of curricular offerings in over fifty institutions 
found the traditional subjects of foreign language, 
mathematics, English and science offered in a large 
degree with reference to the total offerings. On the 
other hand, while twenty-five percent of the total offer- 
ings was found to be in foreign languages, twenty-five 
percent was also given to the practical and occupa- 
tional aspects. The tentative assumption may be 
made that the junior colleges are tending to develop 
groups of curricular offerings which are less tradi- 
tional and more vocational, practical and pre-profes- 
sional than has been the customary practice in the 
first two years of the liberal arts and science colleges 
of America. 
As earlier indicated, an analysis of the curricula 
offered in local junior colleges as shown in published 
bulletins, and as found in practice, in the most ef- 
ficiently administered institutions will give evidence of 
the provision for a wider group of interests of students 
than has been true under the usual four-year traditional 
college organization. For example, in the first semes- 
ter of the first year of a pre-commerce and general 
business curriculum, the following appears: English, 
three hours; chemistry, four hours; principles of ac- 
countancy, three hours; economic resources, three 
hours; algebra, two or three hours; and physical 
education, one hour. In the first semester of the pre- 
medical curriculum of the first year there are the fol- 
lowing studies: English I, three hours; inorganic
-P-A-G-E-323
THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IDEA 301 
chemistry and qualitative analysis, four hours; zo- 
ology, four hours; algebra, two or three hours; elec- 
tives, one to three hours; physical training, one hour. 
The literature and arts curriculum includes, in the 
first semester of the first year: English, three hours; 
language, four hours; history, three hours; chemistry, 
four hours; algebra or trigonometry, two hours; phys- 
ical training, one hour. 
Of course, detailed problems arise, such as, why the 
persistency of chemistry in all three of these curricula? 
These samples have been presented, however, chiefly 
for the purpose of illustrating the tendency toward 
flexibility and differentiation versus the rigidity and 
uniformity of earlier practices in the curricular offer- 
ings of the first two years of college education. 
As partial evidence of the fact that considerable lee- 
way exists between the colleges located in different 
communities, a few examples are chosen from ecur- 
ricula offered in another typical public junior college. 
In the commerce and administration curriculum of the 
first semester of the first year are listed: Commercial 
geography, three hours; accounting, three hours; 
rhetoric, three hours; mathematics, five hours; and 
elective, seven hours. In the engineering curriculum 
may be found: Chemistry, five hours; general en- 
gineering drawing, four hours; mathematics, five 
hours; rhetoric, three hours; trigonometry, two hours. 
In the literature and art curriculum are the following 
studies: Rhetoric, three hours; German, French or 
Latin, four hours; mathematics, five hours; history, 
four hours. What is known as the ‘‘multiple cur- 
riculum’’ practice is characteristic of both of the in-
-P-A-G-E-324
    302 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
stitutions from which these examples have been 
chosen. 
The Preparation of Teachers.—The tentative stand- 
ard for the training of junior college instructors as 
outlined by the North Central Association, it will be 
recalled, was stated earlier as college graduation plus 
one year of post-graduate work in some standard 
higher institution of learning. The maximum teach- 
ing load permissible per week is eighteen hours, but 
fifteen hours is strongly urged. In regard to the 
junior-senior high school unit, it has already been sug- 
gested that ideally the qualifications and training 
should be similar for the junior and senior cycles. 
Analogously, it seems quite justifiable to suggest that, 
ideally, the qualifications and training in the junior 
and senior cycles of the college should be similar. 
Under certain conditions, in the smaller private 
types and even in some of the public types, this ideal 
may appear to be too high. The above statement ap- 
plies primarily to academic preparation. In the name 
of consistency it seems appropriate also to suggest 
that the same professional training should be required 
of junior college instructors as is required of those in 
the junior-senior high school. 
Future Possibilities and Problems.—It is too early 
to make any predictions as to the final outcome of the 
junior college movement. Any historically-minded 
individual would refuse to prophesy concerning the 
future of an institution having only a little over a 
decade of existence. Certain communities have been 
known to become over-ambitious in their attempts to 
organize public junior colleges that were not up to
-P-A-G-E-325
  
THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IDEA 303 
standard in terms of financial support and equipment, 
number of pupils available or a competent teaching 
staff. It is not justifiable to continue several more 
years of work practically on a level, scholastically con- 
sidered, with that of the four-year high school. In- 
creased differentiation of curricula should be accom- 
panied by increased quality of work and product. 
One of the most outstanding problems of the junior 
college has to do with the duplication of curriculum 
offerings. This is one of the most pressing problems 
for solution of those which affect the whole American 
educational ladder. How to discover and determine 
the most satisfactory proportion between a profitable 
amount of overlapping on the one hand, and elimina- 
tion on the other, is not an easy task, since it is pos- 
sible to use the same materials on different levels and 
for different purposes. For a number of years, it has 
been known that courses offered in high schools and 
colleges overlapped considerably. This conviction is 
corroborated by Professor Koos’s extensive study. 
To quote from his report once more, ‘‘The depart- 
ments in which the college offers considerable work 
classed as secondary, taking both amounts and per- 
centages into account, are English, most of the for- 
eign languages, chemistry and physics among the sci- 
ences, history, art, music, and the engineering and the 
industrial group. . . . The salient facts are that a full 
fifth of all work offered to freshmen and sophomores 
in the eight-six colleges is secondary and almost a 
fourth is partly secondary, i. e. between two fifths and 
a half is secondary and partly secondary, the remain- 
der being more strictly collegiate.’’ It is well known  
-P-A-G-E-326
304 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
that these overlappings have appeared also between 
the elementary schools and the secondary schools, be- 
tween the normal schools and the secondary schools 
and between the normal schools and the colleges, as 
well as between the secondary schools and the colleges. 
How to avoid undue duplication, and yet preserve a de- 
sirable continuity and progression of work in the 
junior-senior high school, the junior-senior college and 
the professional schools, is a genuine problem to be 
faced by school administrators.

  CHAPTER XVI 
BROADENING AIMS OR OBJECTIVES OF 
AMERICAN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Introduction.—Practically all of the prominent 
authors of educational classics or treatises have sug- 
gested general aims of education. In some instances, 
school systems and subject matter were organized in 
conformity with these aims, and in other instances not. 
It is possible to trace out historically the aims of 
secondary education, as such, in both Europe and 
America, covering a span of several hundred years or 
more. It is important to set forth clearly the current 
aims of American secondary education, due to the fact 
of their increased number as well as to the fact of their 
modified nature. The chief purpose of this chapter is 
to give a résumé of the historical development of 
secondary school aims and to indicate, briefly, their re- 
lation to the nature of organized subject matter, up to 
the present time. 
The Necessity of Clearly Formulated Aims.—The 
consciousness of aims or ends is essential in the opera- 
tion of any well organized institution. Such ends 
determine the direction of the means and methods to 
be used. The objectives for general training, and for 
specialized training, are somewhat different. In case 
the objective is definite and comparatively simple, the 
306 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
BROADENING OBJECTIVES OF EDUCATION 307 
means and method will be correspondingly simple. In 
the event that conditions become more complex, as is 
now true in the instance of secondary education, it be- 
comes necessary to increase the number of objectives. 
Due to rapidly changing conditions and to the con- 
sequent changing conceptions of the functions of sec- 
ondary education, an increased number of secondary 
school objectives should be clearly recognized. Multi- 
plicity of objectives involves complexity of procedure 
with reference to the means and methods used in the 
attempt to realize the desired objectives. A careful 
analysis of values is therefore important in the cur- 
rent attempt to formulate a revised set of objectives 
and the corresponding functions of secondary educa- 
tion. The need for the reorganization of the modern 
secondary school so as to be in harmony with a new 
set of environmental factors is obvious. Equally ap- 
parent is the need for agreement upon a group of 
objectives that will reflect the most desirable ideals and 
the activities which pupils inevitably will participate 
in later on, as well as the ideals and activities now in 
operation round about the secondary schools. 
Outstanding Assumptions in European Secondary 
Schools during the Nineteenth Century—The general 
assumptions relative to the functions of secondary 
education are notably different in Europe and in 
America. Briefly, those of the European schools are: 
(1) The higher schools exist primarily for the sake of 
the upper and select classes of society; (2) the content 
of subjects taught shall be chiefly academic in nature; 
(3) the chief method of determining the nature of 
subject matter is that of custom or traditional prac-
-P-A-G-E-330
308 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tice; (4) little differentiation of subject matter, if any, 
should occur on the level of secondary education; 
(5) preparation for higher institutions of learning is 
the chief desideratum, or purpose of the secondary 
schools. The above assumptions apply largely up to 
the last decade of the nineteenth century, at which 
time certain modifications were made. Assumptions 
pertaining to American secondary schools will be 
given later on. 
Aims of European Secondary Schools.—The aims of 
the secondary schools of the three most—~prominent 
countries of Europe are definitely known. Especially 
is this true with reference to the nineteenth century, in 
Germany, France and England. In Germany, as noted 
in an earlier chapter, three general types of secondary 
schools exist, namely, classical, semi-classical and non- 
classical. Hach of these three types of schools is rep- 
resented by a nine-grade or nine-year course, and also 
by a six-grade course. The classical gymnasium was 
by far the most dominant, type of secondary school in 
Germany. The chief purpose of the classical gym- 
nasial type of school in Germany was preparation 
for the university. In France, the two representative 
types of secondary school were the lycée and the com- 
munal college. The primary purpose of these schools 
was preparation for the university. In England, the 
grammar schools and the ‘‘public schools’’ were repre- 
sentative of secondary education, and their main pur- 
pose was preparation of pupils for the university. 
Speaking as a whole of the nineteenth century, up to 
its last decade, for all three of these countries then, 
preparation for further scholastic work in higher in-
-P-A-G-E-331
  
BROADENING OBJECTIVES OF EDUCATION — 309 
stitutions of learning was the outstanding purpose. 
In certain respects, in the French secondary schools, 
there was some opportunity for variation from this 
single purpose because of the operation of the prin- 
ciple of election. But it is approximately an accurate 
description to say that European secondary or higher 
schools represented a one-line, or single-path, proce- 
dure for all pupils. Two facts should be borne in 
mind: First, the higher schools are attended only by 
the well-to-do and higher classes, speaking in economic 
and social terms; second, the latter two years of the 
secondary schools in Europe compare chronologically 
with the first two years of the American college. 
General Assumptions Pertaining to American Sec- 
ondary Education.—Certain assumptions in terms of 
aims and curricula are posited with reference to 
American secondary schools, most of which are in con-, 
trast to the European situation. Briefly they are as 
follows: (1) Secondary schools exist for the sake of 
all so-called classes of society, upper, middle and com- 
mon; (2) the content of subjects taught shall include 
all other probable modes of desirable social experience, 
and practical activities, as well as the academic mode; 
(3) the chief method of determining the objectives of 
secondary education and the corresponding subject 
matter shall be through analysis of both the perma- 
nent and the changing interests, activities and ideals 
of different groups of pupils; (4) during the first half 
or more of the six-year period of secondary education, 
subject matter having a fundamental common interest 
for all pupils shall be offered; during the latter half 
subject matter differentiated to meet the needs of  
-P-A-G-E-332
  310 SECONDARY EDUCATION~ 
varying interests of different groups of pupils should 
be offered; (5) the formulation of secondary school 
objectives should include the social and practical 
ideals and activities of experience as well as the aca- 
demic interests of pupils. 
Aims of Earlier American Secondary Schools.— 
Preparation for the university was the purpose of the 
Colonial grammar schools of the seventeenth century 
and the first half of the eighteenth century. Prepara- 
tion for practical life activities, as well as preparation 
for the university, was the aim of the academies dur- 
ing the latter half of the eighteenth century and during 
the first half of the nineteenth century, the first aim 
being dominant. During the seventy-five years after 
the first public high school was established, the double 
purpose of preparation for the university and prep- 
aration for practical life activities continued. Prep- 
aration for college broadened, however, so as to 
include pre-professional work for the ministry, for 
law, for medicine, for engineering, for commerce and 
for education as well as for liberal arts and science 
work in colleges. Previously, it was remarked that 
the Committee of Ten, in its report in 1893, recognized 
that preparation for college was not the only purpose 
to be served by the high school, so far as the announce- 
ment of a general policy was concerned. As was true 
in Hurope, so in America, custom and tradition had 
more to do with determining the nature of the earlier 
aims than any other factors. 
Sociological Foundations of Education.—Secondary 
education involves certain psychological foundations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  BROADENING OBJECTIVES OF EDUCATION 311 
These aspects were reflected in the discussions of ear- 
lier chapters, including the nature of the learning 
- process of pupils, individual differences and the use of 
mental tests, the technique of instruction and so forth. 
But secondary education rests firmly also on certain 
sociological foundations. And it is at this point that 
educational aims and sociological foundations are 
closely related. That is to say, secondary school aims 
must be directly evolved out of the sociological foun- 
dations of education. a Series of Efforts by Individuals and Committees.—* 
During the early part of the twentieth century, a grow- 
ing consciousness developed concerning an enlarge- 
ment or expansion of secondary school aims. The 
formulation and revision of secondary school objec- 
tives was developed both through national committees 
and through individual educators. The most conspic- 
uous formulation of a new group of objectives by a 
committee appeared in the publication of the Cardinal 
Principles of Secondary Education under the auspices 
of the National Education Association, less than a 
decade ago. 
This was the first serious effort made in American 
secondary education to analyze the ideals and activi- 
ties of pupils as a whole, including both academic and 
non-academic interests and needs. For convenience 
of analysis and discussion these ideals and activities 
were organized into a number of general group-aims. 
Back of this analysis of the ideals and activities of ex- 
perience, in terms of aims, was the assumption that 
the high school has other important functions to per-

form beside preparation for liberal arts work in 
higher institutions of learning, important as that 
may be. 
Enumeration of the National Education Association 
Objectives——A number of leading educators were ap- 
pointed by the National Education Association to 
formulate a group of secondary school objectives. 
The result of the work of this Commission on the Re- 
organization of Secondary Education was the publica- 
tion of the list of seven well-known objectives by 
the reviewing committee. In brief, they emphasize 
preparation for life in terms of desirable and actual 
activities as follows: (1) Health activities; (2) funda- 
mental tool-subject activities; (3) vocational activi- 
ties; (4) worthy home membership activities; (5) civic 
activities; (6) leisure-time activities; and (7) ethical 
activities. 
The chief value of the work .of this committee lies 
in the fact that it re-focused attention upon the need 
for an expansion of aims, and the corresponding func- 
tions, of the modern American high school. The mem- 
bers of the commission frankly admit that the list of 
aims overlaps and that the aims are interrelated. 
They did little by way of applying the aims in detail, 
except to illustrate the general nature of the proce- 
dure. The group of aims is to be considered as a 
common body of ends applicable to all departments of 
the high school. They represent the minimum list to 
be realized by all pupils and instructors of the institu- 
tion considered in its entirety. It is. necessary to sup- 
plement these large general objectives with those that 
are more specific. This phase has been carried for-
-P-A-G-E-335
  BROADENING OBJECTIVES OF EDUCATION 313 
ward by other individuals not represented on the 
above-mentioned commission. Through more than a 
dozen other committees of the Commission on Reor- 
ganized Secondary Education the aims of the separate 
high school subjects have been formulated. 
Since only a limited number of copies of the bulletin, 
Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education, are avail- 
able in most communities, and since this publication 
contains in outline the pioneer work in the field of ob- 
Jectives of secondary education, a quotation is here 
given in detail taken from the original report: 
In order to determine the main objectives that should guide edu- 
cation in a democracy it is TE SSSSary, to analyze the activities of the 
individual. Normally he is a~ member of a family, of #vocational 
group, and of various civic groups, and by virtue of these relation- 
ships he is called upon to engage in activities that enrich the family 
life, to render important vocational services to his fellows, and to 
promote the common welfare. It follows, therefore, that worthy 
home-membership, vocation, and citizenship, demand attention as 
three of the leading objectives. 
Aside from the immediate discharge of these specific duties every 
individual should have a margin of time for the cultivation of 
personal and social interests. ‘This leisure, if worthily used, will 
recreate his powers and enlarge and enrich life, thereby making 
him better able to meet his responsibilities. The unworthy use of 
leisure impairs health, disrupts home life, lessens vocational effi- 
ciency, and destroys civic-mindedness. The tendency in industrial 
life, aided by legislation, is to decrease the working hours of large 
groups of people. While shortened hours tend to lessen the harm- 
ful reactions that arise from prolonged strain, they increase, if 
possible, the importance as an objective. 
To discharge the duties of life and to benefit from leisure, one 
must have good health. The health of the individual is essential 
also to the vitality of the race and to the defense of the nation. 
Health education is, therefore, fundamental.
-P-A-G-E-336
  314 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
There are various processes, a5 as reading, writing, arith- 
metical computations, and oral and written expression, that are 
needed as tools in the affairs of “life. Consequently, command of 
these fundamental processes, while not an end in itself, is never- 
theless an indispensable objective. 
And finally, the realization of the objectives already named is 
dependent upon ethical character, that is, upon conduct founded 
upon right principles, clearly perceived and loyally adhered to. 
Good citizenship, vocational excellence, and the worthy use of 
leisure go hand in hand with ethical character; they are at once 
the fruits of sterling character and the channels through which 
such character is developed and made manifest. 
This commission, therefore, regards the following as the main 
objectives of education: 1. Health. 2. Command of fundamental 
processes. 3. Worthy home membership. 4. Vocation. 5. Citizen- 
ship. 6. Worthy use of leisure. 7. Ethical character. 
The naming of the above objectives is not intended to imply that 
the process of education can be divided into separated fields. This 
cannot be, since the pupil is indivisible. Nor is the analysis all- 
inclusive. Nevertheless, we believe that distinguishing and naming 
these objectives will aid in directing efforts; and we hold that they 
should constitute the principal aims in education. 
The Four Objectives of the North Central Associa- 
tion Committee-—The Committee on Unit Curricula 
of the North Central Association of Colleges and Sec- 
ondary Schools has suggested a composite list of four 
ultimate aims or objectives of secondary education. 
These are as follows: (1) The maintenance of health 
and physical fitness; (2) the right use of leisure time; 
(3) successful participation in vocational activities; 
(4) the sustaining of certain definite social relation- 
ships, domestic, community, civic, moral and religious. 
The method of determining these four objectives is 
similar to that of the National Education Association, 
namely, analysis of existing, and of desirable, activi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-337
  BROADENING OBJECTIVES OF EDUCATION 315 
ties. The reduction of the number of objectives to 
four instead of seven simply means that the social ob- 
jective has been used in a more generic or inclusive 
sense than it was by the first committee. In the list of 
the North Central Association Committee, the social 
objective includes the family, the community and moral 
and religious aims. 
Since the report will not be available to nearly all 
of the secondary school instructors in America, a 
further statement is here given. The first task was to 
consider standards in the reorganization of curricula. 
The following paragraphs are quoted: 
It is not the function of this committee to propose ideal curricula 
or to present a summary of present practice. On the contrary, 
the task assigned to us is to set forth certain fundamental considera- 
tions which in our judgment underlie any succeessful attempt to 
secure adequate reconstruction of high school curricula. This task 
will be considered under three heads: First, consideration will be 
given to the problem of the proper statement of the objectives of 
secondary education; second, discussion of the functions of those 
objectives as they relate to curriculum making; and third, brief 
consideration will be given to the organization of the curricula 
of secondary education and the general problem of administration. 
It is obvious that a clear determination of objectives is always 
fundamental in the process of curriculum making. It is also evi- 
dent if these objectives are to function properly they must be stated 
in terms sufficiently definite to serve two purposes: (1) As stand- 
ards by which aceurate evaluation can be made of material now in 
use; and (2) to serve as criteria for determining constructively nec- 
essary changes in subjects, subject matter, and organization. Fortu- 
nately these aims need not be determined on a theoretical basis. The 
present demands upon the secondary school are fairly well defined 
and sufficient progress has been made in educational practice to in- 
dicate the lines along which reorganization should take place. 
The outstanding need apparently at the present time is an analy- 
*, %  
-P-A-G-E-338
  ¥ 
316 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
sis of the inclusive goals already generally agreed upon and a state- 
ment in detail of their meaning and purpose. The objection to 
the goals as generally stated is not that they are not proper goals, 
but that they do not in themselves point out with sufficient clearness 
the more immediate objectives which must control educational prac- 
tice. It is the purpose, therefore, of this committee to suggest in 
some detail the more definite goals which must guide in educational 
practice. 
It seems desirable to your committee to consider the aims or 
goals of secondary education under two heads: (1) The ultimate 
goals toward which all our educational endeavor is directed; and 
(2) the more specific aims which serve directly as guides in the 
selection of subject matter and in determining emphasis and neglect 
in teaching. 
It is essential of course that we have clearly defined standards for 
measuring the final results of teaching and learning. These we 
now quite generally agree should be conceived in terms of disposi- 
tions and abilities. The responsibility rests heavily upon the sec- 
ondary school at this point, for two reasons. (1) The period of 
years spent in the high school is the one in which dispositions 
toward life and its responsibilities are easily formed. (2) This 
school furnishes to many young people practically the only oppor- 
tunity to discover and develop abilities. This cannot be accom- 
plished except in a limited way by the elementary school. A very 
large number of those pupils who complete the high school will not 
continue their education in higher institutions, hence the opportunity 
and responsibility of the secondary school. 
The ultimate aims stated in terms of disposition and ability may 
be summarized as follows: 
1. To maintain health and physical fitness 
2. To use leisure time in right ways 
8. To engage successfully in vocational activities 
4. To sustain successfully certain definite social relationships such 
as domestic, community, civic, and the like 
These are worthy objectives of all education and are particularly 
significant as related to secondary education for the reasons stated 
above. How can they be attained? Only by cultivating appropri- 
ate dispositions and developing corresponding abilities. It is 
   
-P-A-G-E-339
BROADENING OBJECTIVES OF EDUCATION 317 
obvious, therefore, that we must turn our attention from the prod- 
ucts of education to its processes. And it is at this point that we 
have not been sufficiently specific. The immediate aims, those which 
guide in the selection of means, in the choice of method and in de- 
termining school organization need to be stated clearly and in de- 
tail. Ultimate aims are stated in terms of dispositions and abilities 
while the immediate ones must be thought of in terms of acquiring 
and developing. There is, of course, no real separation of these 
two sets of aims. The former are/in constant process of realization 
conditioned by what is acquired and the degree and kind of develop- 
ment which is taking place. The latter find their meaning and 
significance in a constant process of realization of ultimate aims. 
They are implicit in these aims and it is our purpose to make them 
explieit by definite statement. 
The immediate aims may be summarized as follows: 
1. Acquiring fruitful knowledge 
1. Preparative to acquiring other knowledge 
2. Knowledge which functions directly in developing disposi- 
tions and in discovering and developing abilities 
3. Knowledge useful in control of life situations 
2. Development of attitudes, interests, motives, ideals and appre- 
ciations 
3. Development of definite mental techniques in memory, judg- 
ment, imagination and the like 
4. Acquiring right habits of conduct and useful skills in living 
The aims thus stated will probably be accepted generally as con- 
stituting the guides in determining educational practice. But we 
cannot stop here. It is just at this point we find the greatest 
present need in our attempt to reorganize secondary education. 
What kinds of knowledge are of most worth? What attitudes, 
ideals, motives, etc. are essential? Habits and skills with respect 
to what life situations are necessary? These questions can be an- 
swered only by an analysis of the various objectives of acquiring 
and developing. 
The limits of this report prevent an external analysis of the 
problem. Our contribution is such that it must be confined to two 
things: (1) Calling attention to the imperative need of such analy- 
sis in detail and (2) to point out by way of illustration a few
-P-A-G-E-340
  318 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of these more specific aims which must guide in educational prac- 
tice. These questions can be answered only by going back to our 
ultimate objectives and making inquiry there concerning how these 
ean be attained. This inquiry constitutes the chief need of both 
the theory and practice involved in any fruitful reorganization of 
secondary education. If health and physical fitness of those edu- 
eated is to constitute one of the standards by which we determine 
the efficiency of the school, then the way in which this standard 
ean be made to function in educational procedure will have to be 
made clear. 
Professor Bobbitt’s List of Objectives—In addi- 
tion to the work done by these national committees, 
certain educators have contributed fundamentally to 
the formulation of secondary school objectives. One 
of the most outstanding attempts of the use of the 
‘‘activity-analysis’’ method of determining objectives 
has been carried on by Professor Franklin Bobbitt. 
Keeping in mind what adults can, will, and ought to 
do, he proceeds to discover the activities involved, and 
the necessary abilities for the performance of these 
activities. The following represents his list of general 
objectives involved in the major fields of human activ- 
ities : 
. Language activities and social intercommunication 
. Health activities 
. Citizenship activities 
General social activities—meeting and mingling with others 
Spare-time activities, amusements, recreations 
. Keeping one’s self mentally fit 
. Religious activities 
. Parental activities,—the upbringing of children and the main- 
tenance of a proper home life 
9. Unspecialized or non-vocational practical activities 
10. The labors of one’s calling 
ENoahwne
-P-A-G-E-341
BROADENING OBJECTIVES OF EDUCATION 319 
Only a very few representative specific objectives 
from Professor Bobbitt’s extended list will be sug- 
gested here. Under the language activity objective 
appear sixteen specifications, one of which is: (1) 
‘Ability to use language in all ways required for 
proper effective participation in the community life’’; 
another (6) ‘‘ Ability to use language which is gram- 
matically correct’’; and another (7) ‘‘Ability effec- 
tively to organize and express one’s thought in written 
form.’’ Under the general objective on the ‘‘mainte- 
nance of physical efficiency’’ appear a list of more than 
100 specifications, some of which follow: (103) ‘‘ Abil- 
ity to utilize muscular exercise as a lifelong means of 
maintaining a high level of physical vitality’’; (104) 
“Ability and disposition throughout life to engage 
with pleasure and profit in a varied repertory of 
games, sports, athletics, outdoor recreations and so 
forth’’; (111) ‘‘Ability to relax physically and men- 
tally at proper times in proper ways’’; (116) ‘‘ Ability 
to employ setting-up exercises for corrective or emer- 
gency purposes when nothing better is available.’’ 
Recognizing the value of what the National Education 
Association Commission had contributed, Professor 
Bobbitt proceeds, first, to add to the list of general ob- 
jectives, and then proposes scores of supplementary 
‘specifics’? under each of the ten general objectives. 
The first nine of the general objectives constitute the 
pupil’s general training, and the tenth, the pupil’s 
specialized training.

From an observation of his summary, it will be noted 
that aims and functions are somewhat definitely dis-

tinguished. It will, furthermore, be noted that under 
the first thirteen aims set forth, eighty percent or 
above of the twenty-five statements emphasize ‘‘gen- 
eral or liberal training’’, ‘‘civic-social responsibil- 
ity’’, ‘‘recreational and esthetic aspects of life’’, ‘‘oc- 
cupational efficiency’? and ‘‘physical efficiency’’. In 
ease of ‘‘civic-social responsibility’’ and ‘‘occupational 
efficiency’’ the unanimity of opinion was 100 percent. 
Unanimity of Opinion as to Objectives.—A compari- 
son of the objectives listed from all of the previous 
sources considered, national committees, individual 
educators and the composite list of aims taken from 
the twenty-five printed statements, shows that there is 
an encouraging unanimity of opinion expressed as to 
the aims and corresponding functions of reorganized 
secondary education. A quotation from Professor 
Koos, based upon his own tabulated facts, will serve 
to express the result: 
Leaving out of account objectives infrequently advocated, a 
composite of the statements urges that a general or liberal training 
be provided in the modern secondary school with the following as 
major objectives: training toward ciyic-social responsibility broadly 
conceived to include moral, religious, and domestic aspects; train- 
ing for the recreational and aesthetic aspects of life; training 
toward physical efficiency; and training for occupational efficiency 
(for those going on, collegiate preparation). At the same time 
the processes of training are to be maintained at as high a mental 
level as possible, with the aims of achieving intellectual efficiency in 
these important aspects of living. As facilitating the achievement 
of the foregoing aims for any large proportion of the population, 
the following functions must also be performed: demoeratizing 
secondary education, recognizing individual differences, providing 
for exploration and guidance, recognizing the nature of the student 
at adolescence, and providing training in the fundamental processes,
-P-A-G-E-344
  322 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
It should be assumed that the social and civic ob- 
jectives, as well as the other major ones, are com- 
plex. Corresponding abilities need to be determined. 
“Then,’’ to quote Professor Koos further, ‘‘the task 
remains of deciding upon the types of knowledge, 
kinds of attitudes, motives and interests and nature of 
habits essential to good citizenship,’’ or to the realiza- 
tion of any of the other major objectives. 
The Relation of Objectives to Curriculum Formula- 
tion—Now that unanimity of opinion has been ex- 
pressed with reference to the nature of secondary 
school objectives, what influence is this to have upon 
the nature of subject matter offered? To make a dog- 
matic statement, the subject matter should conform to 
the objectives agreed upon. It is with respect to this 
aspect that the Committee of the North Central Asso- 
ciation has recently concerned itself most. Its hope is 
to establish a method of procedure that will outline 
subject matter in conformity with the major objectives 
of secondary education. To quote its attitude: 
“The detailed objectives of secondary education con- 
stitute the criteria for determining necessary reorgan- 
ization of curricula.’’ Further illustrations of the 
exact method of procedure of formulating subject mat- 
ter will be given under the treatment of the depart- 
ments of English, general science and physical educa- 
tion.

  CHAPTER XVII 
THE BUSINESS OF CURRICULUM-MAKING 
IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Introduction.—In recent years, the question has been 
raised as to how far the secondary school should be 
responsible for devising and revising its own curric- 
ular offerings. Who shall be responsible for devising 
secondary school curricula, and what shall be the 
method of procedure? What shall be the relation be- 
tween modern secondary school curricular offerings 
and modern secondary school objectives? A number 
of efforts have now been made in secondary schools 
to answer these queries, at least in a tentative way. 
’ Necessarily the discussion of this chapter overlaps 
with that of the discussion of the content of subject. 
matter in the next chapter. 
The Use of Mental Discipline and Tradition as 
Curriculum Criteria—‘‘Mental or formal discipline’’ 
has been used very extensively as a criterion in the 
addition and retention of school subjects in the high 
school program of studies. Practically every so-called 
solid or academic subject, and in many instances the 
more practical subjects also, have been justified on 
this basis. In its earlier and most extreme form, this 
doctrine meant that the mind, or mental powers—per- 
ception, memory, reasoning—could be so trained 
324 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
THE BUSINESS OF CURRICULUM BUILDING = 325 
through any one school subject that this ability would, 
without loss, be transferred to any other field, related 
or unrelated. Later on, this criterion assumed modi- 
fied types designated as ‘‘transfer of training’’ or 
“improved efficiency.’ The proponents of somewhat 
different theories are such writers as Professors Judd 
and Thorndike. Professor Judd’s emphasis is upon 
the power or ability to generalize, as for example, in 
linguistic work, or in the use of scientific method. Pro- 
fessor Thorndike’s emphasis is upon the transfer of 
training due to ‘‘identity of content’’ and of ‘‘method”’. 
While experimentation seems so far not to have given 
us any final conclusions relative to the matter of mental 
discipline, the general assumption now made is that 
some transfer of training does take place. The sur- 
prising thing, however, is to find that many individuals, 
even at the present time, apparently justify the inclu- 
sion of high school subjects chiefly on the basis of the 
earlier extreme form of mental discipline. In the 
light of the development of other fundamental criteria, 
it is not justifiable to make the older type of formal 
discipline the sole, nor even the chief, criterion in the 
inclusion of high school subjects. As almost every 
writer on modern secondary education has taken oc- 
casion to point out, the use of tradition as a basis for 
curriculum making and the selection of subject matter 
has been prominent throughout the history of second- 
ary education in America. Evidences of this are ob- 
vious in the curricula used in the earlier types of 
secondary schools in America. This same tendency 
has continued, since the establishment of public second- 
ary education, to be a very prominent criterion. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  326 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
criterion is not satisfactory for dominant use for the 
reason that it represents a static basis, unsuited to 
the need of adapting subject matter to new and chang- 
ing conditions. This criterion has a certain legitimate 
place in giving emphasis to desirable permanent ideals, 
interests and activities. But this needs to be comple- 
mented by criteria which also take into account new 
ideals, ideas, interests and activities. Criticism of the 
American high school program of studies relative to 
its traditionalistic and formalistic nature will be re- 
ferred to again in the discussion of the following 
chapter. 
Parker’s View Concerning the Selection of Subject 
Matter.—The problem of the selection of subject mat- 
ter anticipates the discussion of the next chapter. But 
it seems pertinent to mention it briefly at this point. 
Professor 8. C. Parker has listed the bases for the 
selection and organization of subject matter under 
four significant categories: (1) The selection of sub- 
ject matter in relation to varying social needs; (2) 
the determination of relative values; (3) the intensive 
treatment of fewer unit topics; (4) organization in 
terms of the learner instead of in terms of the subject 
itself. The chief advantage, perhaps, in the substitu- 
tion of the categories representing this viewpoint for 
the criteria discussed above lies in the fact that a 
larger guarantee of meaning and purpose for the 
learner are given to all subjects and subject matter 
taught. Putting the first two categories together it 
may be said that the relative value or importance of 
subject matter offered under respective secondary 
school subjects shall be chiefly determined in terms of 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  THE BUSINESS OF CURRICULUM BUILDING = 327 
varying or changing social needs from generation to 
generation. That subject matter taught shall be 
adapted to the social needs and to the individual ca- 
pacities of the learner is the statement also of a funda- 
mental principle which may be used as a working 
hypothesis in ric secondary school curriculum 
making. 
Recent Methods of Devising and Revising Secondary 
School Curricula—Within recent years it has been 
presumed that the responsibility for devising curricula 
might well be extended or spread out so as to include 
a larger number of individuals than was formerly the 
case. Two somewhat diverse attitudes toward this 
problem have been expressed. On the one hand, it is 
assumed that curricula should be formulated primarily 
by the teaching staff in codperation with the chief 
executive of the school system, and his immediate as- 
sistants. On the other hand, it has been assumed that 
because of the difficulty of the task, because of the 
need of a high degree of specialized knowledge in 
curriculum theory, this task should be performed by 
curriculum experts or specialists together with the as- 
sistance of students of experimental research and in- 
vestigation. 
In certain of the larger cities of the United States, 
as well as in some of the smaller communities, there is 
at present an attempt to use several groups of in- 
dividuals in the curriculum making project. These 
groups have been indicated as including administrative 
and supervisory officers, classroom teachers of the 
separate school subjects and the expert or specialist 
in curriculum theory and curriculum making. In a
-P-A-G-E-350
328 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
few instances, a fourth group consisting of the pro- 
gressive and intelligent lay-members of schools has 
been suggested. 
Perhaps the most common procedure in over half or 
more of the established high schools in the United 
States is for the high school principal to do one of 
several things. First, he may accept bodily the 
program of studies inherited from his predecessor, 
without reflection and so, consequently, without modi- 
fication. This procedure is no doubt very common 
both in large and small high schools. Second, the 
principal, either alone or in codperation with the 
superintendent, or perchance himself assuming the 
roles of both superintendent and principal, in a smaller 
school system, may make out a program of studies 
finished and complete, not to be modified for some 
time. These curricula, ready made, are turned over to 
teachers for their use. Third, a state course of study 
sent out by the state department of public instruction 
may serve as a guide. In some instances this is used 
slavishly. In other instances it is modified so as to 
fit local conditions of different high school communi- 
ties. A fourth practice is now to be found in the 
larger school systems in the organization of a perma- 
nent department of curriculum revision, constituted of 
various committees, the assistant superintendent act- 
ing as general chairman of all the committees of one 
or both units of the secondary school system. A fifth 
practice has consisted of curriculum formulation 
chiefly through the guidance and suggestion of an ex- 
pert in curriculum theory and construction. 
Under the first two practices, programs of study,  
-P-A-G-E-351

THE BUSINESS OF CURRICULUM BUILDING 329 
curricula and courses of study are likely to be con- 
structed intermittently and with little regularity. In 
the third instance, they are rather semi-continuously 
changed. In all of the first three instances the cur- 
riculum is made more or less single-handed, though in 
case of state departments, committees sometimes make 
the courses. Relative to both the fourth and the fifth 
| types of procedure it is assumed that curricula will 
need to be continuously reconstructed in harmony with 
new conditions, and through the codperation of one 
committee with another, or through the codperation of 
an expert with a number of groups possessing a variety 
of interests and viewpoints both inside and outside of 
the formal school system. 
Résumé of McClure’s Study of the Principal’s Con- 
tribution in Curriculum Revision—Mr. McClure of the 
Seattle schools, Washington, made an investigation 
relative to the principal’s relation to devising, revis- 
ing and supervising curricula. The attempt was to 
determine by vote of 31 superintendents in cities of 
100,000 and over, and by vote of 38 superintendents 
in cities of 30,000 to 100,000, how far the principal 
contributes to curriculum revision, under four heads, 
namely: (1) Determination of objectives; (2) evalua- 
tion of subject matter;'(3) gradation according to 
maturity; (4) adaptation to classroom instruction. 
The results of the investigation were as follows: (1) 
High School principals contribute less in the deter- 
mination of major objectives than in any of the other 
three phases; (2) they contribute somewhat more to 
the evaluation of subject matter; (3) they contribute 
most to the gradation of subject matter and to the

adaptation of courses to teaching situations. The 
tabulated facts serving as the basis for these state- 
ments may be found in the original article published 
by Mr. McClure, and are as follows:

Professor Bobbitt in Los Angeles is representative of 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
THE BUSINESS OF CURRICULUM BUILDING 331 
one of the outstanding methods of procedure in cur- 
riculum formulation. In the monograph published by 
the University of Chicago on Curriculum Making in 
Los Angeles, may be found a capital illustration of 
one current method of curriculum formulation which 
involves the codperation of a large group of persons 
together with a curriculum specialist. Professor 
Bobbitt worked for parts of two different years with 
such groups as are indicated by the following quota- 
tion: 
The initiative for the work naturally originated with the city 
superintendent of schools. General direction has been provided 
by the two assistant superintendents of junior high schools and 
senior high schools. Leadership in the detailed labors has been 
entrusted to the Department of Educational Research and to a 
series of committees composed of high school principals, heads of 
departments, and teachers. There is one committee for each high 
school department, composed of twenty-five members, or one rep- 
resentative from each junior and senior high school. The total 
committee membership therefore is in the neighborhood of three 
hundred. This plan provides for a subject leader for each sub- 
ject in each high school. This has made it possible to enlist the 
entire corps of junior-senior high school teachers, and then draw 
upon all the professional experience, and judgment anywhere avail- 
able within the organization. 
The outcome of this attempt has been so widely 
broadcast during the last two or three years through 
the writings of Professor Bobbit that it seems un- 
necessary to discuss the matter here in any detail. 
The work in Los Angeles represents the largest orig- 
inal effort to reconstruct a whole city school system 
through the codperation of a specialist and a large 
group of public school officers. One of Professor Bob- - ee
-P-A-G-E-354
  332 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
bitt’s dominant theses is that educational results 
should be stated in terms of human abilities. Such 
abilities were analyzed in great detail by him and his 
committees. 
Professor Charters and Curriculum Construction.— 
Most of the work done by Professor Charters in the 
matter of curriculum construction has been confined 
to the elementary school. His earlier work had to do 
with the reconstruction of language and grammar 
materials based largely upon the errors made by 
pupils. His more recent contribution is to be found 
in his attempt to make a job-analysis of the ideals and 
activities of individuals in various occupations, and 
then, upon the basis of his analysis, to construct ap- 
propriate curricula. To quote: ‘‘The principles to 
be applied are simply stated. The activities and 
ideals of society must be determined, evaluated and 
selected; the best methods of performing the activities 
under the domination of appropriate ideals must be 
collected; and the materials so determined must be 
presented at the psychological moment in the life of 
achild.’? On the basis of these principles he proceeds 
to formulate an elementary school curriculum made up 
of reading and literature, natural science, math- 
ematics, foreign languages and practical and fine arts. 
Much of his discussion is applicable to the grades 
comparable to the three-year junior high school, as 
well as to the lower elementary school grades. 
Curriculum Revision in Social Science in the Den- 
ver Public School System—Some similarities exist 
between the methods of procedure used in the recon- 
struction of curricula in the Denver public school sys-

tem and that used in Los Angeles. Some differences 
of procedure also are apparent. A brief résumé of the 
reconstruction of the work in social science in Denver 
is here given as illustrative of the general method of 
procedure used there. A similar procedure has been 
used in the other junior high school subjects with the 
hope of extending the reorganization gradually on 
through the senior high school. The summary here 
given includes an outline of the general plan of curric- 
ulum revision, applicable to all of the other subjects 
as well as to social science; the organization of the 
subject matter taught into large unit topics in harmony 
with a previous principle of arrangement of subject 
matter; the general objectives of social science teach- 
ing and some illustrative problems used under the 
respective unit-topics:

Arrangement of Modern History in Terms of Units 
in the University of Chicago High School.—One of 
the four bases for the selection and organization of 
materials of instruction, previously referred to, was 
the intensive study of unit topics. The unit topics 
outlined under the modern history course offered in 
the junior and senior years of the University of Chi- 
cago High School is representative of the above sug- 
gestion. The course is, in general, as already in- 
dicated, organized in terms of large unit topics. The 
goal or purpose is mastery of the minimum essentials 
of each unit. One unit of work consists of the Indus- 
trial Revolution, under which the following aspects 
are considered: (1) Domestic system of industry, 
manufacturing, commerce, transportation, agricul- 
ture; (2) development of textile industries in relation 
to the coming of the factory; (3) improvement in 
transportation, from 1760 to 1830, roads, canals, steam- 
boats, railroads; (4) chief economic, social and politi- 
eal results. Seven other large unit topics considered 
are: (1) The French Revolution; (2) The Era of Met- 
ternich; (3) The Development of Nationalism; (4) The 
Slavery Controversy; (5) The Westward Movement; 
(6) The Expansion of Industrial Nations; (7) The 
World War and Reconstruction. In the University of 
Chicago Laboratory School, the attempt is to meas- 
ure the results of the teaching*in terms of mastery. 
Courses of study are developed through trial and mod-

ification of the same, through a series of years and un- 
der controlled conditions, by experts and specialists 
in curriculum theory. 
The Method of Procedure of the Unit Curricula 
Committee of the North Central Association—The 
method of procedure represented by the Committee on 
Unit Curricula of the North Central Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools is to recognize clearly 
the ultimate and immediate objectives of secondary 
education, and then in the light of these objectives to 
formulate subject matter which will contribute to the 
realization of the objectives. Very briefly this may 
be illustrated in the case of first-year junior high 
school English. One of the four major, general or 
ultimate objectives outlined is that of leisure time. 
One of the immediate objectives under it is that of 
‘“‘acquiring fruitful knowledge.’?’ Under this imme- 
diate objective may be discussed the topic of travel, 
involving an acquaintance with: (1) Purposes of 
travel; (2) history, traditions, arts, occupations and 
customs of peoples; (3) methods and conveniences of 
travel. Illustrative material in books such as Stod- 
dard’s lectures, Geographical Readers and How We 
Travel, would assist in realizing the aim of acquiring 
fruitful knowledge relative to travel. In the same 
way, acquiring fruitful knowledge of good literature 
through acquaintance with standard writers, past and 
present, would include readings in standard poetry, 
fiction, science, mythology, art and so forth. 
In the instance of science, from the standpoint of 
the major ultimate objective of health and in terms of 
the immediate objective of acquiring fruitful knowl-
-P-A-G-E-360
  338 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
edge preparatory to acquiring other knowledge, illus- 
trative materials may be found in: (a) The combina- 
tion of elementary facts and principles chosen in 
relation to the more specialized later biological and 
physical sciences, but with no attempt to catalog them 
under separate specialized fields, and with no one field 
dominantly represented by the interest of any one 
specialist in science; (b) the study, for example, of 
common foods, relative to their value in tissue-forming 
and body-heating; their adaptation to different occu- 
pations, different ages of pupils, and different climatic 
conditions; and their purity and impurity. 
These two examples have been given merely as brief 
illustrations of the method of procedure. It should 
be noted again that the interest of this committee is 
in subject matter of common good for all in the earlier 
cycle or unit of secondary education, and in differ- 
entiated subjects, as such, later on in the second unit 
or cycle. 
General Evaluation of the Theory and Practice of 
Curriculum Making.—At the outset, let it be assumed 
that curriculum formulation is a part of the business 
of any well organized secondary school, and that, 
therefore, it is not a justifiable procedure for high 
school principals merely to accept a program of 
studies from year to year made out by predecessors 
in the same school, or to accept without analysis tra- 
ditional programs from high schools in general. One 
argument that obviously will be made against the 
method of devising curricula principally through 
teacher participation is that many, if not most, of the 
teachers will not be able to give the reasons for their 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  
\ 
THE BUSINESS OF CURRICULUM BUILDING 339 
faith, nor to justify their materials according to basic 
principles. On the other hand, it will likely be argued 
by some persons that participation by teachers in 
curriculum making offers a fine type of professional 
training and experience, and that it will motivate 
teaching and increase the efficiency of instruction be- 
cause of first-hand familiarity with the subject matter 
to be taught. 
It is also argued contrariwise by some persons that 
curriculum construction requires the knowledge of 
curriculum experts and specialists who have made a 
thorough analysis of the whole philosophy or theory 
of secondary education, and that the number of per- 
sons capable of doing this work is limited. It is too 
early to know whether the results of teaching under 
this new cooperative plan of curriculum making will 
be superior to those obtained under the more tra- 
ditional procedure. It seems fair to presume at 
present that neither the curriculum specialist working 
alone, nor the practical high school administrators 
working alone, will accomplish the results most 
desirable. The problem appears not to be the absence 
of the curriculum specialist, but the relative part he 
shall be expected to have in the actual process of 
curriculum formulation. Because of the need for 
adapting curricula to varying situations, it is doubtful 
whether any group of experts is capable of formulating 
suitable curricula for all communities apart from the 
assistance of competent local committees. On the 
other hand, it does seem justifiable to assume that a 
group of codperating curriculum specialists might be 
able to outline the basic principles, assumptions and
-P-A-G-E-362
  340 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
general method of procedure, which might then be car- 
ried forward by the most competent school officers and 
instructors in respective secondary school systems. 5 
The Committee on Unit Curricula of the North 
Central Association is in agreement with other com- 
mittees and individuals who are insistent upon a clear 
recognition both of general or ultimate, and of spe- 
cific or immediate, objectives. The method of pro- 
cedure in relating subject matter to these objectives 
according to all individuals and committees should be 
carefully studied at the present time with the hope of 
finally evolving the best type of procedure either 
through adopting a composite of the methods used or 
else of selecting that method which promises to pro- 
duce most efficient results.

CHAPTER XVIII 
THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE CONTENT OF 
SECONDARY SCHOOL SUBJECT MATTER 
Introduction—What curricular knowledge in sec- 
ondary schools is of most worth? The answer to this 
question is complicated and difficult. Attempts to 
answer it, both in theory and practice, have been made 
for a century or more in America. Some of these 
answers have been more satisfactory than others. 
The purpose of this chapter is to present a brief survey 
of a limited number of attempts to outline suitable sub- 
ject matter. Is it possible to select subject matter that 
is adapted to meeting the social needs of pupils? Are 
certain aspects of subject matter under the respective 
school subjects, as such, more suitable than others, 
judged in terms of the criterion of meeting social 
needs? First the viewpoints of Spencer, Eliot and 
others will be briefly summarized, then further com- 
ment will be made in the light of the recommendations 
of the Committee on Unit Curricula of the North Cen- 
tral Association, together with some discussion of 
present-day practices in secondary schools. 
Spencer’s View on Knowledge of Most Worth.— 
The above interrogative statements relative to sub- 
ject matter set forth one of the outstanding problems 
of modern secondary education, in both Europe and 
342
-P-A-G-E-366
  
  344 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
America. In 1859, Spencer published, in its original 
form, what has since become known as one of the world- 
renowned educational classics, What Knowledge is of 
Most Worth? The writing of this treatise was defi- 
nitely occasioned by the current practices of the sec- 
ondary schools of England in his day and generation. 
The content of subjects taught in these schools most 
of the time had been based almost exclusively upon 
that of classical languages and literatures. And so he 
suggested that the schools did not concern themselves 
at all with the business of life, or the knowledge ac- 
cumulated through scientific advances, but rather with 
mumbling over dead formulas. 
In order to appreciate fully the setting and signifi- 
cance of Spencer’s treatise, it is necessary to recall 
that an interest in the scientific movement of affairs, 
frequently characterized as realism in the extra- 
schoolroom world, had been begun as early as the 
seventeenth century. At that time, the telescope, the 
barometer and the air-pump had been invented. The 
Copernican theory with reference to the center of 
the universe and Boyle’s law with reference to gases, 
Newton’s law of gravitation and Harvey’s demonstra- 
tions with reference to the circulation of the blood had 
introduced a changed order of thinking. 
By the time of Spencer’s death, a formidable list 
of other inventions and discoveries had been added. 
Some of these affected economic production; others, 
the increased facility of means of travel; others, the 
preservation and prolongation of life. A representa- 
tive list, which may be suggestive, follows: The 
reaper, the sewing-machine and the printing press;
-P-A-G-E-367
GENERAL NATURE OF SUBJECT MATTER 345 
travel by steamboat; travel on land by railway, steam 
and electric, and by automobile; travel through the air 
by the flying-machine; improved means of communica- 
tion through the use of telephone, telegraph and radio 
systems; increase of comfort acquired through modern 
means of lighting and heating by coal, gas, petroleum 
and electricity; the preservation of health and the 
prolongation of life through the use of life-preserv- 
ing and life-restoring instruments and the discovery 
of antiseptics, serums and antitoxins; and so forth. 
These have all led to the need of recognizing the funda- 
mental relation between the theories and the applica- 
tions in the field of natural sciences and life activities. 
Some of the above changes had occurred by the time 
Spencer wrote his educational document on knowledge 
of most worth. 
Spencer’s analysis was limited by the fact that he 
stopped short of the full implications of the basis on 
which he began to discover the needs of society. He 
did specify that chemistry, physics, physiology, biology, 
mathematics, astronomy, history and the science of 
society should constitute the secondary school cur- 
riculum. But it has been necessary to go beyond him 
and attempt to select the types of subject matter in 
much greater detail than he did with reference to its 
adaptation to present-day social needs. In other 
words, the scope of activities assumed by him is far 
too limited in the light of present needs in secondary 
education.

Peculiarly enough, the scientific discoveries and in-

ventions above suggested only slowly influenced the 
nature of the content taught in secondary schools. 
Some advance had been made in both elementary and 
secondary education, but the progress was compara- 
tively slow. Spencer, therefore, raises one of the 
genuine problems of modern secondary education in 
attempting to make an analysis of the various forms 
of activities found and to propose that appropriate 
corresponding subject matter be taught in the schools. 
The pertinence of calling attention to Spencer’s dis- 
cussion is to be found in the fact that, with striking 
clarity of vision, he anticipated the present-day move- 
ment which emphasizes the need of making careful 
analyses of everyday social needs and of practical life 
activities. 
Many writers on aims, subject matter and methods 
of instruction in the past, have been accustomed to call 
attention to the Spencerian method of analysis. 
Briefly stated, it emphasized a five-fold set of activities, 
namely, Health, Vocational or Practical, Household or 
Family, Social or Political and Leisure-time or Recre- 
ational. Under the general problem of health he re- 
fers to the specific problems of proper food, proper 
ventilation, the prevention of disease and the rational 
treatment of bodily ailments resulting from accident or 
disease, as against superstitious and ineffective prac- 
tices. Likewise he analyzes the other four general 
problems into a number of specific problems. It is the 
business of secondary education, he contends, to con- 
sider these scientific and social aspects as well as the 
classical aspects. 
Résumé of Eliot’s Point of View.—In 1918, Presi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
  GENERAL NATURE OF SUBJECT MATTER 347 
dent-Emeritus Eliot of Harvard University pub- 
lished, under the auspices of the general Education 
Board of New York City, a bulletin entitled ‘‘Changes 
Needed in American Secondary Hdueation.’’ In sub- 
stance this article is a critical commentary upon the 
traditionally inherited programs of study offered in 
American secondary education. His treatise is so sug- 
gestive as a point of departure with reference to the 
discussion of the problem of the programs of study 
of secondary schools that it is herein presented in some 
detail. For convenience of treatment, it may be sum- 
marized under four headings: (1) The chief object of 
education at all levels or stages; (2) A criticism of 
past and present secondary education; (3) An analysis 
and examination of a dozen secondary school pro- 
grams; (4) The general nature of a desirable, modern, 
secondary school program of studies. 
In terms of the prime object of education, it is main- 
tained by him that progressive and continuous sensory 
training should be offered, respectively, at the levels 
of elementary, secondary and even higher education. 
Administratively considered, such training usually 
ceases at the end of the elementary school at best. 
But because it develops accurate observation, increased 
skill and measured reasoning, on the part of pupils, he 
insists it should continue beyond the limits of elemen- 
tary education. 
For the past twenty-five years, it has become a 
platitude in the educational world that secondary 
school programs, for the most part, during the nine- 
teenth century, were unmodified inheritances, chiefly 
classical in nature. Similarly, President Eliot indi-.
-P-A-G-E-370
  348 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
cates the traditional nature of the subjects of language, 
literature, history, philosophy and a limited amount 
of mathematics, which are usually represented in the 
general program of studies. This fact furnishes the 
basis of his criticism that secondary school studies have 
been over-traditionalistic and over-formalistic. This 
criticism is explicitly stated by him. By implication, 
he also assumes that the traditional studies are ill- 
adapted to the new scientific developments and indus- 
trial changes that took place after 1850, which 
developments furnished the basis for the new profes- 
sions of medicine, in particular, engineering of various 
types and commerce. 
In order to discover actual practices relative to the 
proportionate emphasis given to observational and 
other subjects, he examined and analyzed twelve typi- 
cal secondary school programs in the regions of New 
England and the Middle West, the majority of the 
institutions representing the private type. His find- 
ings, in brief, were that the more abstract subjects 
predominated in number and amount over those which 
provided direct sensory training through sensory 
avenues of learning. To quote verbatim, the general 
finding was that ‘‘secondary schools are giving not 
more than from one-tenth to one-sixth of their force 
to observational, sense-training subjects’’. 
In the light of both his criticism of the traditional- 
istie studies and his examination of typical current 
practices, he suggests the nature of a desirable and 
justifiable program of studies. One of his chief as- 
sumptions is that school subjects should meet the 
changing needs of both rural and urban communities. 
 
-P-A-G-E-371
  
GENERAL NATURE OF SUBJECT MATTER 349 
In the light of this assumption more work in natural 
sciences, manual arts and fine arts, is recommended. 
To quote to the point: 
Multitudes of Americans continue to regard the sense-training 
_ subjects as fads and superfluities. They say, “the public elementary 
schools should teach thoroughly reading, writing, spelling and 
arithmetic, and let natural science, drawing, music, domestic arts 
and crafts and manual training, severely alone. Let the secondary 
schools teach thoroughly English, Latin, American history and 
mathematics, with a dash of economics and civics, and cease to 
encumber their programs with bits of the new sciences, and the 
new sociology.” This doctrine is dangerously conservative: for it 
would restrict the rising generation to memory studies, and give 
them no real acquaintance with the sciences and arts which within 
a hundred years have revolutionized all of the industries of the 
white race, modified profoundly all the political and ethical con- 
ceptions of the freedom-loving peoples, and added wonderfully to 
the productive capacity of Europe and America. 
This résumé has been given partly because a number 
of the problems of the modern secondary school pro- 
gram of studies are reflected. One of them is to be 
seen in the statement made by those who think of the 
newer subjects as ‘‘fads’’ rather than as a vital part 
of the educative process as a whole. Briefly stated, 
shall natural sciences and social studies be regarded 
as ‘‘fads’’ and taught with a ‘‘dash”’ of them, or shall 
they be regarded as fundamental ‘‘core’’ subjects? 
An evaluation of President Eliot’s article leads one 
to make the following statements: (1) The emphasis 
placed upon sensory-motor education by him is, on the 
whole, psychologically justifiable because of the fact 
that learning through the sensory avenues does repre- 
sent a natural process at all levels and stages of educa-
-P-A-G-E-372
  350 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tion, and does not by any means cease its effectiveness 
during the secondary school period. (2) The expan- 
sion of the program of studies so as to include all of 
the subjects that represent the newer scientific, indus- 
trial and social changes occurring in both rural and ur- 
ban communities is sociologically justifiable. (3) His 
attempt to make a first-hand observation and analysis 
of actual secondary school programs represents a valid 
and commendable procedure. (4) Hisclaim that train- 
ing in the genera: power of observation comes about 
through sensory education in terms of natural sciences 
and other sensory subjects is open to debate in the 
light of modern psychology. At times, sensory educa- 
tion seems to be regarded solely as an end rather than 
as a more concrete basis for later more abstract rea- 
soning and generalization on the part of pupils. (5) 
Perhaps the total number and the types of schools 
examined were somewhat too limited to be made the 
basis of a final generalization as to the nature of sub- 
ject matter taught in secondary schools. 
Flexner’s View of the “Modern School”.—Presi- 
dent Hliot’s article was significant in that it called 
attention to the need of broadening the program of 
studies so as to include the full sweep of life activities. 
The article written by Secretary Flexner reiterated 
some of the original statements of Eliot’s article. His 
criticism of past education was that it was over- 
traditionalistic, over-formalistic and largely meaning- 
less. His chief test or reason for including certain 
school subjects was: Do they serve a realistic, genu- 
ine, useful or meaningful purpose, which enables pupils 
to interpret physical environment and phenomena, as
-P-A-G-E-373
GENERAL NATURE OF SUBJECT MATTER 351 
well as to understand and appreciate current indus- 
trial conditions, science and political and social institu- 
tions? In the light of this test for including subjects, 
the following modifications and omissions are sug- 
gested: (1) The amount of geometry might well be 
greatly reduced, and the remainder modified in-nature: 
(2) The desirability of algebra for girls intending to 
enter college, and for boys preparing for law, medi- 
cine, journalism and theology is debatable. (3) 
Neither Latin nor Greek should be included chiefly on 
the grounds of mental discipline. (4) Industrial and 
social life activities and modes of living should be 
substituted for militaristic and political history. (5) 
Neither formal grammar, nor abstract mechanical 
analyses of literature should be included chiefly on the 
basis of the mental discipline they offer. (6) Physi- 
cal education facilities and other extra-curricular ac- 
tivities should be provided. 
The general nature of the earlier part of the school 
curriculum, therefore, is to be constituted of what are 
designated as ‘‘instrumental studies’? composed of the 
tool-subjects adapted to meeting the needs common to 
all pupils, reading, writing, spelling and arithmetic. 
In addition to these, four fields of activities should be 
included: Natural science as a dominant feature; in- 
dustrial activities relating to the fundamental needs 
of food, clothing and shelter; the esthetic arts, includ- 
ing literature, music and other fine arts; and civic and 
social activities. : 
Influence of Dewey upon Reorganized Elementary 
Education—The writings of John Dewey after 1895 
profoundly influenced the theory and practice of ele-
-P-A-G-E-374
352 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
mentary education in America. While his contribu- 
tions had chiefly to do with the elementary school, some 
of his fundamental principles are applicable to the 
secondary school as well. Dewey was born in the year 
1859, the year during which Spencer’s discussion of 
What Knowledge is of Most Worth? appeared. In 
some respects the educational theories of Spencer and 
Dewey agree. Dewey, however, made practically no 
separation as such between life-time and school activi- 
ties, and so revised Spencer’s statement that education 
is preparation for life by contending that education is 
life itself. 
Both were concerned, however, in relating more 
closely the home, the school, and life-time activities. 
The industrial revolution which had occurred from 
1850 to the first decade of the twentieth century in- 
creased almost immeasurably the complexity of the ed- 
ucational problems suggested by Dewey. Two items 
in Dewey’s theory of elementary education are closely 
related to the modern theory of secondary education. 
First, what relative place shall a study of industrial, 
economic and social conditions occupy in secondary 
school curricula? Second, does such study result in 
merely a utilitarian or materialistic value, or can such 
study be made liberalistic and cultural as well as some 
of the more traditional subjects taught? Dewey’s 
answer to the second question, quoted by many writ- 
ers, it that: ‘‘The industrial history of man is not a 
materialistic or merely utilitarian affair. It is a mat- 
ter of intelligence. Its record is the record of how 
man learned to think, to think to some effect, to trans- 
form the conditions of life so that life itself became a 
   
-P-A-G-E-375
GENERAL NATURE OF SUBJECT MATTER 353 
different thing.’? Dewey’s answer to the first ques- 
tion is equally emphatic and prominent. The study 
of ‘‘oceupations’’ and ‘‘industries’’ is to be regarded 
as the central core of activities around which the 
school is to be built, because they represent the funda- 
mental social ideas and ideals of various peoples. 
From 1896 to 1903 this theory was actualized in prac- 
tice in the experimental elementary school of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago. To paraphrase his fundamental 
tenet, the school prepares pupils best for life through 
a reproduction in the schoolroom of the typical occu- 
pations, industries and conditions of life itself. 
“‘Wor,’’ he says, ‘‘the fundamental point in the psy- 
chology of an occupation is that it maintains a balance 
between the intellectual and practical phases of ex- 
perience.’’ 
The fundamental place accorded to language as a 
means of individual thought, as well as a means of 
communication between individuals, according to 
Dewey is worthy of large recognition both in ele- 
mentary and secondary education. It is not the pur- 
pose at this point to discuss the aims of language study 
in detail. The chief purpose is simply to suggest that 
language, especially the mother-tongue, is so funda- 
mental that it must be included in any consideration 
of the nature of subject matter to be taught, not only 
in the elementary school but also in the secondary 
school, because through it classifications for thought 
are made, and meanings are preserved and communi- 
cated, and extended or developed. 
General Viewpoint of the Committee on Unit Curric- 
ula of the North Central Association—The committee 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  354 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
on Unit Curricula of the North Central Association be- 
lieves that ‘‘the objectives of secondary education 
constitute the criteria for determining necessary re- 
organization of curricula’’, and that ‘‘there are certain 
common needs of all high school students which must 
be met by certain subjects and types of subject matter 
common to all curricula’’. In the third place, the in- 
terest is in the presentation of subject matter best 
adapted to the realization of the desirable objectives, 
no matter under what separate school subject it may 
be found. That is to say, while administratively it 
may be necessary to speak of separate secondary 
school subjects as such, yet the most important ques- 
tion is, what is the nature of the content of the various 
kinds of subject matter under respective school sub- 
jects best suited to the realization of the ultimate and 
immediate secondary school objectives? The follow- 
ing quotations have to do in part with the method of 
procedure in curriculum making, and in part with the 
actual content itself: 
The assumption that high school pupils have certain common 
needs to’ which the school should minister is of course not new. 
Required subjects in high school curricula from the very beginning 
of this institution constitute the objective evidence of this fact. 
We have assumed that these common elements would meet the 
common needs. Historically, certain subjects in mathematies have 
been required of all students, and this is in a measure true of certain 
other subjects. The practice of requiring English did not prevail 
in the early high schools, but it has developed until now it is a 
universal requirement. It is obvious, therefore, that such require- 
ment is not new, and it is assumed by this committee that there is 
general agreement that the practice should be continued. If this 
assumption is correct, there are only two questions to be determined
-P-A-G-E-377
  GENERAL NATURE OF SUBJECT MATTER 355 
in this relation. The first is whether the same subjects should be 
depended upon to furnish the common elements, or whether other 
subjects should be assigned this important place in curricula. The 
second question is whether we need to modify the subject matter of 
these traditionally required subjects if they continue to furnish 
the common elements, or to modify the subject matter of other 
subjects if they are to take the place of these traditional ones. 
Proper consideration of these questions will determine the po- 
tential universal values of the subjects and the types of subject 
matter in the light of universal needs of students. For example, 
in our analysis above of the goals of high school education from 
the standpoint of health and physical fitness, it was there pointed 
out that certain types of knowledge should be acquired, certain 
attitudes cultivated, and certain habits developed. These objectives 
became criteria for the selection of subject matter in the various 
fields of knowledge which will contribute most largely to the realiza- 
tion of these ends. Further, they will determine the kinds of 
activities to be engaged in for the accomplishment of the same 
purposes. If our educational practice does not meet the require- 
ments when measured by these standards, the practical question 
remaining is what modifications are necessary, both in types of 
subject matter and activities. 
Considerable change has already taken place in the amount of 
required work. On the whole much less change has occurred in the 
character of such work. Adaptation, so far as required work is 
concerned, except in the field of English, has been largely negative 
until recently. That is to say, we have attempted to secure adapta- 
tions through redueing requirements rather than by means of 
changing requirements. One cause, no doubt, of this reduction has 
been the decrease in the number of specified units required for 
college entrance. In a recent study of entrance requirements of 
more than one hundred higher institutions it is revealed that ten 
units were specified in 1912, and only six such units in 1920. This 
change in the practice of higher institutions has been instrumental 
in reducing the number of required units for high school gradua- 
tion. But another factor has entered in and this is the important 
one for our consideration here. In reducing absolute requirements 
we have assumed either of two things, or perhaps both: (1) That
-P-A-G-E-378
  356 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
differentiated needs are more numerous and important than com- 
mon needs; or (2) that common needs can be met in large meas- 
ure by differentiated subjects and subject matter. English, and 
in less degree mathematics, supply the common elements. That 
is to say these constitute the subjects generally required of all 
students. 
In recent years requirements in the field of the social studies 
have increased considerably. This Association made a recommenda- 
tion three years ago that American History be required in all high 
schools. Similar action has been taken in recent years by other 
educational agencies. These recommendations, and some change in 
practice in the same direction, indicate that more importance is 
being attached to the potential universal values in this type of 
subject matter. But in practice we still regard algebra as having 
greater value than civics, American History or physiology in meet- 
ing a universal need of high school students. 
Science is an absolute requirement in many high schools, indicat- 
ing that this field is regarded important from the standpoint of 
common elements. An examination of practice, however, reveals 
great lack of uniformity in specific requirements. Some schools 
require one branch of science, others another branch, and still 
others make no requirement except on a quantitative basis. Stu- 
dents must take one or more units of science, but whether botany, 
physies, or geology is chosen, is a matter of indifference. General 
science, where taught, is more frequently required than any other 
unit of science. 
Foreign language except in the small schools, and here for ad- 
ministrative rather than pedagogical reasons, has almost ceased to 
be regarded as a common element. Commercial and industrial sub- 
jects are not included in the lists of required subjects in the great 
majority of schools. The same thing is true of the fine arts in 
even greater degree. 
In the judgment of your committee, relatively more attention 
should be given to ascertaining and meeting the common needs of 
high school students. Codperation in a democratic society like ours 
demands common attitudes, ideals, interests and motives. These can 
be developed only on a basis of common knowledge and experience.
-P-A-G-E-379
  GENERAL NATURE OF SUBJECT MATTER 357 
And they can be made to funetion only through appropriate abili- 
ties. It is true, of course, that differentiated abilities up to a cer- 
tain point are not only desirable but necessary in codperative effort. 
The point here is that abilities must be appropriate to the kinds of 
expression desired. Some of them will be common and others dif- 
ferentiated. Lither kind will fail to develop or to function properly 
in the absence of common intelligence about and desire for the 
common individual and social ends to be attained. This is true 
concerning all the ultimate goals of education. For example, dis- 
position and ability to engage successfully in vocational activities 
means more than possession by individuals of specialized skills. 
It means that individuals are both willing and able to codperate 
in industry on a basis of common ideals and interests. Vocational 
education, rightly conceived, must therefore take into account the 
demands of an industrial society organized and administered on a 
democratic basis. 
It is probable that not only vocational curricula but all high 
school curricula need considerable reorganization to meet the de- 
mands made upon individuals in the attempt to secure more suc- 
cessful functioning of democratic principles. This is particularly 
true in relation to the development and control of a democratic 
industrial society. 
It has not been the purpose in the foregoing discussion to under- 
estimate the importance of the differentiated needs, interests and 
capacities of high school students. These are receiving increasing 
attention and rightly so. Commendable progress has already been 
made in securing better adaptation of curricula through differentia- 
tion in subjects and subject matter. This work should be carried 
forward until group and individual differences are adequately pro- 
vided for. This, however, cannot be accomplished successfully un- 
less four things are taken into account: (1) There must be better 
adaptation of curricula to the common needs, interests, and capaci- 
ties of students. (2) Differentiated needs require more accurate 
determination than now obtains. (3) Types of knowledge to be 
required, nature of habits to be developed, kinds of attitudes and 
types of skills to be secured must be determined on a basis of these 
needs. (4) These needs must serve as criteria for the selection of
-P-A-G-E-380
  358 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
subjects, subject matter, and activities which constitute differen- 
tiated curricula. 
General Assumptions Relative to the Program of 
Studies as a Whole.—In the light of the broadening 
purposes of secondary education due to the expanded 
interests and conditions, certain general assumptions 
may be made with reference to the nature of school 
subjects: (1) The nature of the program of studies 
should conform to the changed nature of conditions, 
scientifically and socially regarded; (2) school cur- 
ricula represent the chief means through which to 
teach the ideals and modes of experience of any period 
of civilization; (3) curricula should be broad enough 
in scope to include all of the significant varieties of the 
modes of experience and activities; (4) at least five 
groups of subjects and their corresponding subject 
matter are necessary to cover the major modes of 
thought and activities involved in the experience of 
adolescents, in order to realize the present-day second- 
ary school objectives. These core-subject groups are 
as follows: (1) The linguistic, including the elemen- 
tary aspects of foreign languages, but predominantly 
the mother tongue; (2) history and the other social 
studies; (3) natural sciences and elementary mathe- 
matics; (4) practical arts; (5) music and the other 
finer arts. 
The subject matter under all five groups should 
contribute in some measure to all of the general or 
ultimate objectives of secondary education. Certain 
subjects will contribute more to some of the objectives 
than to others. In addition to this, certain contribu-
-P-A-G-E-381
Se ree COR Rapes oni tt gree gen eames ren LIER a Rape) eee Cee ee 
GENERAL NATURE OF SUBJECT MATTER 359 
tions will also be made toward the realization of more 
immediate and specific objectives under the respective 
secondary school subjects. In order to accomplish in 
the junior and senior cycles of secondary education 
these purposes or ends, it is necessary to reorganize 
the traditional subject matter and to adjust the newer 
subject matter to such purposes. Later chapters will 
indicate the nature of some of these new materials of 
instruction as now reorganized, especially in the junior 
cycle of secondary education. | 
The General Evolution of Textbook Subject Mat- 
ter—Two somewhat extreme practices exist relative 
to the selection of textbook and non‘textbook materials. 
On the one hand, textbooks, as such, and other printed 
formalistic materials are predominantly, if not solely, 
used. On the other hand, materials are selected al- 
most wholly, if not fully, from life activities, interests 
and experiences. Genetically considered, subject mat- 
ter among primitive peoples was largely and uniformly 
based upon the practical activities, necessities and 
processes of life, due to environmental simplicity. 
Among civilized peoples subject matter naturally has 
been selected more largely from materials recorded in 
some permanent form. Picture language, parchment 
records and printed books represent historically the 
tendency to stabilize, and frequently to stereotype and 
fossilize, materials of instruction. One of the funda- 
mental curricular problems of the present day is how 
to determine the balance of subject matter between 
that based upon formalized textbooks and that based 
upon everyday life experience in both the junior and 
the senior high school.

  CHAPTER XIX 
THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE 
PROGRAM OF STUDIES IN TERMS OF 
SEPARATE HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Introduction—Some degree of flexibility of the pro- 
gram of studies must be recognized in reorganized 
secondary education. One purpose of this chapter is 
to emphasize the program of studies in toto, in action, 
in terms of the broadening purposes or of the increased 
number of objectives of secondary education. Ad- 
ministratively considered, all of the fundamental modes 
of experience representing the ideas, ideals and ac- 
tivities of the past and present should be included 
under the total number of the groups of subjects rec- 
ognized. In the junior cycle or three-year period, the 
emphasis should be placed upon those aspects of com- 
mon interest to all pupils, which lead to the realization 
of the major or ultimate objectives of secondary edu- 
cation. In the senior cycle, consisting of a three-year 
period, a certain amount of subject matter of common 
interest to all pupils should be continued, but a begin- 
ning should also be made in the differentiation of sub- 
ject matter in harmony with the varying interests and 
needs of senior high school pupils. The definite prob- 
lem to be faced and solved is: How is it possible to 
present balanced groups of curriculum rations to sec- 
ondary school pupils, en masse, and yet, at the same 
362
-P-A-G-E-385
  
ADMINISTRATION OF SEPARATE SUBJECTS 363 
time, lay the basis for providing for the individual 
differences of pupils psychologically and sociologically 
regarded? One answeris: Certainly not by thinking 
of the junior and senior cycles as disparate or abruptly 
demarcated parts of the secondary school system. 
The Necessity of Recognizing the Principle of Pro- 
gressive and Simultaneous Correlations.—Merely to 
outline the nature of the content of separate high 
school subjects and the corresponding subject matter 
will not suffice. The manner or method of the general 
administration of subject matter taught is also conse- 
quential. In the effective administration of programs 
of study the principle of progressive correlation of 
courses in language, social studies, science and so forth 
should be recognized with reference to the junior and 
senior high school units or cycles. The correlation of 
subject matter between the different units of subject 
matter taught within the different departments of the 
junior and senior cycles should also be given consider- 
ation. The first aspect of the above principle has to 
do with the sequential order of arrangement of differ- 
ent phases of groups of subjects, or of single subjects 
taught, during the whole of the six years of secondary 
education. The second aspect has to do with the cor- 
relation of the groups of subjects or of single subjects 
offered at the same respective simultaneous levels or 
stages within the different departments of the junior 
and senior cycles. 
It should be recalled at this point, that one virtue of 
the earlier administration of the so-called solid aca- 
demic subjects, such as Latin and mathematics, was 
that the principle of progressive correlation or con-
-P-A-G-E-386
  364 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tinuity was well recognized. Certain parts of the 
work always were made preliminary to, and prerequi- 
site to, later parts to be studied. On the other hand, 
one of the chief precautions now demanded is avoid- 
ance of the lack of continuity of subject matter taught 
in reorganized natural science, social studies and 
mathematics during the junior and senior high school 
periods. With special reference to the junior high 
school, one suggestion is worthy of further considera- 
tion. An almost unpardonable error committed by the 
traditional curriculum formulator was that he planned 
separate compartment programs of studies for the 
elementary schools, secondary schools and higher in- 
stitutions of learning respectively, and so unduly vivi- 
sected the pupil’s learning process. Another error of 
almost equal proportions, and closely related to the 
first, was that of the mere duplication and repetition 
of subject matter on non-increasing psychological 
levels, especially in case of the upper elementary 
grades. In the remaking of the curricula of second- 
ary education, there should be no abrupt demarcations 
represented between elementary and secondary schools, 
or between secondary schools and junior colleges. 
Education should be regarded as a unit in the large, 
divided into sub-units for convenience of administra- 
tion. 
This leads naturally to the statement that each pupil 
should be well trained in sequential order in two or 
more subjects throughout the secondary school. In 
this way the principle of progression and sequence can 
be utilized in the organization of subject matter. One 
outstanding limitation and weakness of the program 
 
-P-A-G-E-387
ADMINISTRATION OF SEPARATE SUBJECTS 365 
of studies of the junior high school at the present time, 
in the minds of many persons, is that it merely repre- 
sents a mass and maze of the so-called enriched cur- 
riculum materials which have accumulated in such 
fields, for example, as general science and social stud- 
ies. The arrangement of this material in sequential 
order, both within the junior high school, and in the 
transition to, and beyond, the senior high school is 
essential to real success. For instance, what certain 
experimental schools are attempting to do in the 
sequential arrangement of two or more years of history 
is necessary also in the social studies other than his- 
tory, and so on through the round of the other school 
subjects which are taught in both the junior and senior 
cycles of secondary education. 
Recommended Group Arrangments of Subjects and 
Subject Matter—For convenience of administration, 
it will perhaps be necessary to continue the use of 
separate high school subjects as such, but it is im- 
portant to present the kind of subject matter, under 
the various groups of subjects, which will contribute 
most toward the realization of objectives, both general 
and specific. The groups of subjects suitable for such 
a purpose are: Language, history and other social 
studies, natural science, mathematics, practical arts 
and fine arts. Such subjects should include or repre- 
sent cross sections, not mere sectors, of the whole of 
an individual’s experience at different stages of his 
in-school, and of his possible post-school, career. 
Through expansive curricular cross sections of 
meaningful experiences, it is possible to present, in 
summarized form, the ideals and activities of modern
-P-A-G-E-388
  366 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
civilization and to interpret them in all of its dominat- 
ing phases, namely, linguistic, literary, civic, social, 
scientific, vocational, esthetic, moral and religious. 
Modern secondary school curricula should therefore 
represent a continuous series of surveys of the whole 
of the experiences of civilization at varying pupil- 
levels of development throughout the full six years of 
secondary education. Subject matter taught in the 
days of the spinning wheel was necessarily more 
limited in scope than that which is supposedly broad 
enough to express the ideals and activities of the world 
in the days of the aéroplane, with the multiple inter- 
related interests of one sort or another among in- 
dividuals. 
Such modification of curricula as above suggested 
is inevitable in the light of modern secondary school 
objectives. This in turn involves the elimination of 
certain non-functioning materials from certain sub- 
jects, as well as the addition of new materials. The 
exact point at which the inflexible curriculum shall 
cease and at which differentiated curricula shall begin 
may be regarded by many persons as a debatable issue, 
but there is now large agreement to the effect that 
during the first few years of the secondary school 
period a common body of knowledge should be offered 
to all pupils, this period serving chiefly as a time of | 
exploration and adjustment for the pupils. 
The Time Distribution of Subjects—-The relative 
amount of time to be devoted to school subjects is 
involved in the administration of subject matter. 
Usually, this has been determined on the basis of the 
proportionate time-allotment for each school subject. 
 
-P-A-G-E-389
  
ADMINISTRATION OF SEPARATE SUBJECTS 367 
Professor Bobbitt presented a few years ago a signifi- 
cant study of the time-allotment of subjects in terms 
of the percentage of every 100 actual recitations de- 
voted to a school subject. 
A composite list of subjects taken from representa- 
tive modern junior high school programs of study was 
as follows: English, general social studies, general 
science, general mathematics, industrial arts, occupa- 
tional studies, home economics and music and other 
fine arts, together with physical education, guidance 
and extra-curricular, or correlated, activities. Neces- 
sarily differences of opinion will exist relative to pro- 
portionate time-allotment of subjects. In one city 
system, the percentage distribution of curricular time 
in the so-called general curriculum of the junior high 
school was as given below. The percentages suggested 
here refer to the first and second semesters or divisions 
B and A of the first year or seventh grade of the junior 
high school. The distribution was: 
B A 
Languages (English and foreign) 16.6 13.3 
Social Science (history, civics, elementary economics 
and Sociology) 16.6 16.6 
Exact Science (general science and mathematics) 23.3 20.0 
Voeational Studies (shops, mechanical drawing and 
home economics) 13.3 20.0 
Fine Arts (art, design, music) 6.6 6.6 
Health (gymnasium work, hygiene safety education) 16.6 16.6 
Auditorium (centralizing, integrating curricular 
activity of the school) 6.6 6.6 
The Selection of New Materials of Instruction in the 
Junior-Senior High School.—The chief purpose of the
-P-A-G-E-390
  368 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
following chapter will be to suggest illustrative ma- 
terials of instruction, first with reference to the 
changed content of the so-called academic or solid 
subjects, and second with reference to the addition of 
the newer so-called non-academic or practical arts sub- 
jects of the curriculum. The complete formulation of 
such materials within each group of high school sub- 
jects obviously would require the space of a separate 
volume in each case. The materials suggested herein 
are used as illustrative of a point of view and method 
of procedure. 
In the year 1919, a committee was organized un- 
der the auspices of the National Society for the Study 
of Education, for the purpose of making a study and 
a report of new materials of instruction. In the 
Twentieth Yearbook of the above-named society, Chap- 
ter IV of Part I is devoted to the new materials for the 
junior high school in terms of projects relating to 
school activities and civic, vocational, business, home, 
avocational and cultural interests. Part II of the 
Twenty-second Yearbook of the National Society for 
the Study of Education is wholly devoted to the social 
studies in the elementary and secondary school, and 
involves a discussion of four general topics: (1) The 
situation and the need, (2) Types of reorganized 
courses, (3) The method of constructing new cur- 
ricula, (4) A critique of the methods used. In a later 
chapter reference will be made again to the work of 
this Committee on Social Studies. 
In general, it may be said that it is very important 
that definite educational policies be outlined, especially 
in the larger city systems, for five or ten years ahead,
-P-A-G-E-391
  ADMINISTRATION OF SEPARATE SUBJECTS 369 
with reference to curricular problems. In September, 
1919, the board of education of one of the large city 
systems adopted a definite policy pertaining to the 
extension of its intermediate or junior high schools. 
They specified that these schools should provide for 
the needs of three groups of pupils: 
That the pupils of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades be pro- 
vided for in large intermediate schools built to house at least twelve 
hundred pupils and equipped to care for the needs of three groups 
of pupils: 
(a) Those who are certain to leave school as soon as the com- 
pulsory school law will permit. 
(b) Those who are certain to continue their studies in the high 
school. 
(c) Those whose future in school is uncertain. 
Further suggestions were made relative to the senior 
high school: 
That children of grades ten, eleven, and twelve, be provided for 
in cosmopolitan high schools, equipped to meet the physical, social, 
intellectual, and vocational needs of various types of pupils. 
In this same school system the program of studies is 
developed around a ‘‘social core of curricular activi- 
ties’’. Provision is made for knowledge of common 
interest to all pupils in the different courses. No 
differentiation of work and no electives are provided 
in the academic subjects pursued in the seventh grade, 
but an inclusive variety of experience is prescribed in 
the curricular offerings for all pupils. Some differ- 
entiation is provided in the eighth and ninth grades 
through the four curricula offered. Electives within 
the respective curricula chosen are not permissible ex- 
cept in the vocational subjects. That is to say, that
-P-A-G-E-392
  370 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
traditional academic subjects are regarded as con- 
stants within curricula, together with provision for 
work in health education. The summary tabulation 
of the program of studies for the intermediate schools 
of this city is given (on page 371) as representative of 
one school system that offers an enlarged variety of 
curricular experience to its pupils. 
This school is a concrete illustration of an at- 
tempt of a city system to build its junior high school 
curricula around the social needs of pupils. There is 
a conscious attempt to contribute to the modern ob- 
jectives of secondary education. To quote verbatim, 
their bulletin states that this socialized program is 
designed : 
1, To provide for the present and future health of the pupil. 
2. To continue training in the fundamental processes. 
3. To train pupils in their social-civie duties—worthy home mem- 
bership, citizenship and ethical character. 
4. To train future citizens to use their leisure time worthily. 
5. To train pupils for vocational life. 
This school system has been used in some detail 
to illustrate the fact that an attempt is being made 
in practice to reorganize school curricula in harmony 
with reformulated and enlarged aims and purposes. 
In the published statements of other school systems, 
large and small, may be found similar illustrations.

tional Society for the Study of Education has outlined

life course, in San Antonio, Texas, in Lawrence, Mas- 
sachusetts, and in Springfield, Illinois. The Twenti- 
eth Yearbook contains new materials for the junior 
high school illustrating the practices in a large number 
of widely distributed communities throughout the 
whole country. 
QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION 
1. Discuss the general administration of the program of studies 
in the junior and senior cycles, respectively, and of high school in- 
struction, with reference to the relative or proportionate emphasis 
upon the principle of flexibility or inflexibility. 
2. Make clear by concrete examples the application of the prin- 
eiple of progressive correlation or continuity in the earlier academic 
subjects, as well as in the more newly organized academie and 
vocational high school subjects. 
3. Discuss the virtue and limitation of the five groups of subjects 
suggested in this chapter as suitable for high school instruction. 
4. Compare the time distribution of subjects in the above dis- 
cussion with that which you find in practice within various high 
school systems. 
5. Discuss the attempts of the National Society for the Study of 
Education to organize new materials of instruction with reference 
to the need of reorganization, the types of courses, the method of 
curriculum construction and evaluation of the same. 
6. Compare the attempt of a board of education, indicated at the 
end of the chapter, to build curricula around a social core of 
curricular activities, with the practice in other school systems of 
which you know. 
7. What aspects of the procedure of these larger cities are ap- 
plicable as well to smaller high school systems?

  CHAPTER XX 
SELECTION AND ORGANIZATION OF LINGUIS- 
TIC MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION IN THE 
JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
Junior-Senior High School Curricula in the Making. 
—It has been assumed throughout the previous dis- 
cussions of this text, whenever the problem of cur- 
riculum making has been involved, that junior and 
senior high school curricula are now in an imperfect 
stage of reconstruction. In other words, they are in 
the making. More reconstruction has gone on within 
the junior cycle than within the senior cycle. Out of 
the many arguments that have been brought forward 
in the defense of the junior high school, the reorgani- 
zation of subject matter has occupied a relatively 
prominent place. As indicated under a previous chap- 
ter on the junior high school movement, certain state 
and city school systems have outlined definite princi- 
ples and policies with reference to the nature of the 
program of studies to be organized. The predominant 
emphasis in the chapters which follow, dealing with 
the new materials of instruction, will be placed upon 
the junior cycle of the secondary school system. The 
implication is, however, that the same materials should 
be continued, and an appropriate method of procedure 
used, on a different level, in the senior cycle.

  LINGUISTIC MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 375 
Reconstructed Language Subject Matter.—Presum- 
ably, it might appear that the language materials to 
be taught in the secondary schools are so simple, es- 
pecially those having to do with the English language, 
that little consideration need be given to this phase of 
high school reorganization, but this is not so. No 
genuine reconstruction of materials in the field of 
English will work itself out automatically. Two as- 
pects are appropriate for serious consideration in the 
reconstruction of language work offered in secondary 
schools. One of these has to do with the English 
language, as such, considered in terms of language- 
composition, as well as in terms of literature-reading. 
The second phase has to do with two aspects of foreign 
language work. One of these may, for convenience of 
discussion, be characterized as a composite or com- 
bined English-foreign language course. The other is 
concerned with the changed nature of the content of 
separate courses in the fields of ancient and modern 
languages. 
The Correlation Between Form and Content in the 
English Language.—Writers in certain discussions 
in the past have frequently assumed, apparently, that 
there is an opposition between form and content in the 
English work outlined for use in secondary schools. 
Form is here used in the sense of involving all that has 
to do with the mechanics of writing or speaking. It 
has a place of large importance from the beginning to 
the end of the junior-senior high school. The propor- 
tionate amount of emphasis necessary and desirable 
will vary during the different years covered by sec- 
ondary education. In a general way, it is true that 
 
-P-A-G-E-398
  
  376 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the emphasis upon the more formal and mechanical 
aspects of English should decrease toward the end of 
the secondary period. This will depend, however, 
somewhat upon the purpose of the courses offered dur- 
ing the various years. It may be necessary at times, 
for certain reasons, to stress form, temporarily, dur- 
ing the later years also of the high school. It is, there- 
fore, not so much a question of the complete elimination 
or absence of form, as it is of the proper relative 
emphasis to be given form and content, for example, 
in English composition. 
The psychological processes involved in the more 
formal aspects of English have to do with habits, 
skills and routines in the uses of language, whereas the 
content element has to do with gradually higher and 
higher thought-processes involving reflection and 
meaning. There is little advantage in introducing in 
a perfunctory way, at various stages, content in Hng- 
lish composition work which does not have any real 
meaning for pupils. Certain standards and criteria 
of attainment have become established in the teaching 
of the more formal aspects of English. It is equally 
essential to insist that certain standards of meaning 
must obtain on the side of content. True, it is more 
difficult to standardize the content side than to stand- 
ardize the formal aspects. 
Teaching of form and of content in English compo- 
sition cannot ever be wholly separated. How to de- 
termine the relative emphasis upon form and content, 
either during the successive years of secondary school 
work or within any of the respective years, in terms 
of the purpose in hand when the presentation of ma-
-P-A-G-E-399
  LINGUISTIC MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 377 
terials is made, is an important problem. Further- 
more, no teaching of English is satisfactory which 
allows pupils to cease their mental reactions before 
they have reached the level of the reflective and 
thinking stage, either in their composition or in 
their literature work of the upper years of the 
secondary school. Therefore, enough time should 
be devoted to good English teaching to guarantee 
this accomplishment. Three years of junior high 
school work is absolutely essential on the above 
count alone. Two or three years’ work in the senior 
high school is equally justifiable. The offering of 
a fourth year of English in the fourth-year high 
school, or a third year in the three-year senior 
high school, is not defensible unless it does lead pro- 
gressively to a higher and higher type of reflective 
thinking on the part of the pupil. 
On psychological grounds this same line of argument 
may be produced with reference to the literature- 
reading materials offered and taught. A certain 
amount of formal analysis of English classics is val- 
uable, but frequently an overemphasis has been placed 
upon this abstract type of analysis in the past. When 
this procedure is used alone it tends to deaden all love 
and appreciation of even the choicest of literature. 
The most accomplished instructors in American and 
English literature have always induced pupils to go on 
into the level of reflective thinking during their pursuit 
of the more advanced courses. On the other hand, 
those instructors who have been accustomed to the use 
of a stereotyped method of analysis of the traditional 
classics, and of even the more modern social materials
-P-A-G-E-400
  378 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
now introduced, have lost the opportunity of giving 
pupils the real meaning of literature as it relates to the 
great social experiences of the race and of the individ- 
ual. Here, as well as elsewhere in these discussions, 
method or technique of presentation, and the nature of 
subject matter offered, are inextricably interrelated. 
Recommendations and Policies of National Commit- 
tees on Reconstructed English in the Secondary 
Schools.—Pioneer efforts relative to the reorganiza- 
tion of secondary school English were made during the 
latter part of the nineteenth century, and contin- 
ued into the first part of the twentieth century. But 
about the beginning of the second decade of the 
twentieth century, recommendations resulting from 
the work in this field began to be much more copious. 
The National Education Association Commission on 
the Reorganization of Secondary Education, the Na- 
tional Council of English and the more recent com- 
mittee working conjointly under the auspices of the’ 
National Education Association and the North Cen- 
tral Association have all done much to create a 
favorable attitude toward reformulating the aims 
and content of secondary school English. The rec- 
ommendations of the last committee mentioned 
above were published in 1922. This committee reit- 
erated some of the aims previously outlined by other 
committees for the teaching of English, called attention 
to the relative emphasis to be given to form and con- 
tent and suggested, by implication at least, newer so- 
cial materials in addition to the traditional classics 
almost universally used during the earlier history of 
secondary education.
-P-A-G-E-401
  LINGUISTIC MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 379 
The Correlation of English Composition and Liter- 
ature with Other Secondary School Subjects.—Techni- 
cally speaking, the doctrine of correlation was at its 
high tide of expression in educational theory during 
the days of the Herbartian movement in America, in 
the latter part of the nineteenth century. In those 
days, it was applied chiefly to the elementary school, 
in terms of literature and history. It is possible now 
to enrich this concept or principle of correlation in 
relation to secondary school theory and practice in the 
field of English composition and literature. In the 
chapter on the Administration of Subject Matter, 
the importance of recognizing the principle of correla- 
tion has already been discussed. Unquestionably, this 
whole situation is in the making. But trial courses of 
various kinds are now in vogue and will have large 
educational significance. Primarily, this principle of 
correlation is as effective in terms of the content as in 
terms of the form of English composition and litera- 
ture. Makers and instructors of beginning courses in 
English composition can well afford to consider the 
opportunity for correlating, for example, community 
civics and English composition. This has already 
been tried for some time with considerable success in 
certain school systems, and the plan is now being in- 
corporated in small as well as in large high schools. 
There is no reason why the correlation cannot be ex- 
tended with profit to other fields than the social sci- 
ences. In the natural sciences as well as in other high 
school departments there can be found a wealth of ma- 
terial appropriate for use in beginning courses in 
English in the upper grades of the more traditional
-P-A-G-E-402
380 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
elementary school, and in the junior high school, or in 
the lower grades of the four-year high school and of 
the three-year senior high school. 
Viewpoint of the Committee on Unit Curricula of the 
North Central Association——The work of these com- 
mittees has made it possible to develop an attitude 
of mind and point of view not hitherto widely prev- 
alent. One of the outcomes of previous discussions 
has been the development of the consciousness that no 
group of secondary school instructors can be a law 
unto itself. One evidence of this is apparent in the 
recent effort to correlate, with new meaning, the work 
done in different departments of modern secondary 
education. Another evidence is to be found in the 
willingness to accept a body of educational objectives 
applicable and common to all groups of instructors 
within the secondary schools, in particular, as well as 
in the pre-secondary and post-secondary institutions 
of learning. 
So little has as yet been done in rebuilding the con- 
tent of subject matter in English, in terms of these ob- 
jectives, that it must be recognized that, at many 
points, it will be said that we are on thin ice. In 
spite of this fact, the point of view here expressed is 
now regarded as fundamental in terms of the economy 
of time in the learning process, as well as in terms of 
the mastery of materials, and of the possibility of giv- 
ing real meaning to the educative process as a whole. 
Up to date, the Committee on Unit Curricula has not 
attempted to suggest materials beyond the seventh, 
eighth and ninth grades, chiefly due to the lack of time 
to work out any suggestive materials for the senior
-P-A-G-E-403
  LINGUISTIC MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 381 
high school. The following is a preliminary statement 
of a sub-committee on ‘‘A Unit of English Based on 
the Ultimate and Immediate Objectives of Secondary 
Education’’: 
The Seventh Grade 
This is an attempt to define a unit, qualitatively. The question 
answered here is: “What can the subject of English furnish that 
will contribute to the attainment, in the seventh grade, of the im- 
mediate and ultimate objectives of secondary education?” TIllustra- 
tive material is mentioned, contact with which can reasonably be 
expected to produce the results indicated. The quantitative aspects 
of the definition are not touched. 
It is not expected that any class would cover all the readings 
suggested—probably not one third of them. Some of the material 
may be too difficult for the majority of seventh-grade boys and 
girls, but each should be given as mature reading matter as possi- 
ble without defeating the ends in mind. It may safely be said that 
the ability of seventh and eighth grade children to read seemingly 
advanced books and poems is often underestimated. 
The following is a suggestive outline of the work 
for the seventh grade in English in terms of the social 
objective:

those here suggested. This could be done without de- 
feating this plan and without any inconsistency, pro- 
viding the point of view is maintained for which the 
committee stands. 
English-Foreign Language Subject Matter Com- 
bined.—The discussion of English occupies much the 
larger part of this chapter, chiefly for the reason that 
the subject matter outlined under this secondary school 
subject is applicable, as a common body of knowledge, 
especially, during the earlier years of secondary edu- 
cation, to all the students. The advanced work in 
English naturally becomes somewhat specialized and 
is representative of a gradually decreasing body of 
the knowledge absolutely necessary for all pupils. 
There is no good reason why an English-foreign lan- 
guage course could not be organized with considerable 
profit for certain groups of pupils in certain high 
schools. Such a course might be made profitable to 
pupils who are going on to college, as well as to those 
not going on, and might constitute at least two years 
of work. During the first year, emphasis would be 
placed primarily upon the correct use of the English 
language. The second year’s work might be made up 
of two aspects, at least: First, an emphasis upon the 
customs, conventions, and so forth of a foreign people, 
including their representative outstanding institutions 
present and past; and second, a correlation of certain 
phases of one language with another. This is not to 
be regarded as a final outline but as a challenging sug- 
gestion to foreign language teachers. It is obvious 
that types of subject matter can be outlined by expe- 
rienced instructors in foreign languages that will eon- 
 
-P-A-G-E-407
LINGUISTIC MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 385 
tribute definitely to several of the important educa- 
tional objectives now accepted widely, providing the 
traditional content is modified accordingly. The ad- 
ministration of these courses so as to meet the needs 
of pupils going to college and those not going to 
college is a matter of detail to be taken care of by 
the proper school officers. In passing, it may be re- 
marked that the difficulty will probably not be much 
greater than already exists under our present usual 
régime. 
Extended Study of Foreign Language for a Limited 
Number of Pupils—The suggestion made above per- 
taining to composite English-foreign language courses 
might seem to some individuals to destroy the usual 
claims made for foreign language study. The earlier 
claims made for foreign language study, and now ac- 
cepted by many persons, ought not to be overthrown 
without careful consideration. The functional value 
of an ancient language in the past history of educa- 
tion, such as Latin during the sixteenth century, is well 
known. Whether all the values that have been claimed 
in the past in the name of foreign language study, for 
all pupils, are now or can be universally realized is 
open to debate. This does not argue, however, that 
there is no value for any pupils in the pursuit of any 
foreign languages whatever. Two large issues still 
face us. First, can the content of the first year or 
more of foreign languages be so modified that it will 
be of more value to all pupils, and second, even grant- 
ing that only a limited number of pupils do profit con- 
siderably through the pursuit of foreign languages, is 
it possible to reorganize the subject matter for those
-P-A-G-E-408
  386 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
pursuing it for two, three and four years, so that it 
may become still more profitable? The investigation 
carried on by the Classical Association registers it- 
self favorably and affirmatively on this point. 
The Linguistic Sense or Language-Mindedness.—It 
has been customary for many years for teachers of 
history to refer to the attitude of mind characterized 
as the historic sense or historic-mindedness. There 
is little doubt that such an attitude can be developed 
through training. Is it not pertinent, analogously, to 
speak of the development of a language sense or 
language-mindedness, a mode of consciousness that is 
different from one’s reactions in science, but no less 
noteworthy for certain individuals whose likes fall in 
this field of knowledge? Students who are well 
trained in a foreign language certainly do react in a 
different manner when reading the writings, for ex- 
ample, of such authors as Milton or Browning, from 
those having no such training. This linguistic sense 
must not be interpreted as an inherited tendency but 
as due to the result chiefly of training in the linguistic 
content. 
The use of choice English by members of the family 
and their friends, early training in language in the 
elementary school, the extensive general reading of 
books by pupils, and other factors do have considerable 
to do with the development of this so-called language 
consciousness, whether it be in English or in some 
foreign language. Whether some individuals inherit 
more of a linguistic bent than others is open to grave 
doubt. At any rate, the factors involved bearing upon 
social heredity will account for most of one’s language
-P-A-G-E-409
  
LINGUISTIC MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 387 
sense previous to, and during the period of, secondary 
education. 
Every pupil enrolled in our secondary schools is en- 
titled to enough training in English to give him ability 
to use language well in both his speech and his writing. 
This has been conceded by all committees that have 
outlined the aims of the teaching of English. In ad- 
dition to this, each pupil should be given enough train- 
ing to appreciate ancient and modern literature. All 
pupils are entitled to a modicum, at least, of such train- 
ing. Whether the appreciation of the costumes, cus- 
toms and culture of foreign peoples can best be given 
through foreign language study or through trans- 
lations is subject to debate. A rather large group 
of pupils would profit by training in an English- 
foreign language course so far as it would contribute 
to general training and education. Such work would 
stress the social experiences and institutions of dif- 
ferent races. A much more limited group would be 
interested in any technical study of foreign languages. 
Administratively considered, this implies that foreign 
. language proper should be made optional in outlining 
the program of studies for modern secondary schools. 
It is more or less disappointing that neither any large 
number of individual secondary schools nor the com- 
mittees investigating the status of foreign languages 
have used experimentation in order to attempt to de- 
termine relative values of the types of subject matter 
taught. 
Language as a Fundamental Institution of the Race 
and as an Instrument of Individual Thinking—Lan- 
guage instruction is important because it represents  
-P-A-G-E-410
  388 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the major institution for the purpose of preserving 
the ideals, ideas and customs of the race. It rep- 
resents the chief social medium of exchange of thought 
within any one generation, and from one genera- 
tion to another. No social institution in existence 
is more important as a means of communicating what- 
ever is worth while in thought. The complement of 
this principle is that language serves as the chief in- 
strument and vehicle of an individual’s thinking. 
One’s command of vocabulary in the vernacular is in 
a large degree a measure or index of one’s richness of 
thought on the conceptual level. It represents a meas- 
ure of one’s ability to use and read symbolized mean- 
ings in the form of words, both vernacular and foreign. 
Children several years of age have accumulated a com- 
mand of a vocabulary of from 150 to 700, 800 or more 
words. By the time pupils have entered the secondary 
school they have accumulated a fair degree of mastery 
of 10,000 or 12,000 words. This represents no mean 
or unworthy accomplishment. 
Whenever language has been well taught, by this 
time in the development of the pupil’s experience it is 
possible for him to do a rather high degree of con- 
ceptual and reflective thinking as compared with the 
untutored individual of the savage peoples, or even as 
compared with the ability of kindergarten and elemen- 
tary school pupils. What we are in need of, in the 
teaching of both the vernacular and foreign languages, 
is less quibbling about the claims perfunctorily made 
in the name of language teaching and a larger con- 
sciousness of the function of all language as an effec- 
tive tool in individual thinking. Since secondary 
 
-P-A-G-E-411
  LINGUISTIC MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 389 
school pupils are more mature and more capable of 
reflective thinking than they have been at any time in 
their previous school experience, teachers in the sec- 
ondary school lose a great opportunity in the educative 
process if they do not provide conditions most fa- 
vorable for this higher type of work. 
Attitudes of Committees on Reorganized Foreign 
Language Work.—During the last three decades a 
number of committees have suggested plans for re- 
organizing the work of the modern languages. These 
reports and recommendations dealt with the aims, 
content of courses and methods of teaching of modern 
languages in reorganized secondary education. 
Fewer recommendations have been made in the field 
of the ancient languages than in the instance of the 
modern. The Committee of Ten, the Committee of 
Fifteen and the Commission on Reorganized Sec- 
ondary Education (1913), made a limited number of 
recommendations on the aims of content of courses in 
and time to study Latin. The investigation by the 
Classical Association is one of the most noteworthy 
attempts to survey the conditions and status of Latin 
teaching in present day secondary schools. The North 
Central Association Committee on Unit Curricula has 
not attempted to outline any new materials of instruc- 
tion for foreign languages in harmony with the newer 
general objectives of secondary education because it 
was thought best to defer this part of the work until 
the findings of the Classical Association had been made 
and reported. 
The chief purpose of this chapter has been to suggest 
that in the organization of subject matter to be taught
-P-A-G-E-412
  390 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
in the secondary schools, the language group must al- 
ways have a fundamental place. Language, con- 
sidered as a whole, represents a consciousness both 
racial and individual which is very important in the 
educative process. A beginning has been made in the 
reorganization of language courses of the early years 
of secondary education. Much remains to be done in 
the later years, and throughout the whole period of 
secondary education, in terms of the general and spe- 
cific objectives of secondary education.

  CHAPTER XXT 
SELECTION AND ORGANIZATION OF SOCIAL 
SCIENCE MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 
IN THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
Some Difficulties to be Recognized in the Reorganiza- 
tion of Social Studies.—In the first place, the new and 
old materials combined, which are regarded as suitable 
for instruction under social studies, cover such an ex- 
panse of territory and such a large range or scope of 
human experiences that the materials become almost 
unwieldy so far as standardization and organization 
are concerned. Appropriate unit-topics for discussion 
under the core group of studies may conceivably be 
gathered from the social experiences of people ranging 
all the way from the level of primitive, up to that of 
civilized, life. The possible content of subject matter 
to be outlined under the materials for instruction in 
the realm of history and other social studies represents 
practically all of the cross sections of primitive life 
plus the modes of living and ideals involved in the 
economic, industrial, civic and social experience of 
civilized life. The organization of such an overwhelm- 
ing mass of materials is anything but a simple task. 
And it must not be expected that it can be done in a 
very limited length of time. 
In the second place, the history materials now 
392
-P-A-G-E-415
SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 393 
thought most appropriate, especially for the earlier 
years of the secondary school, are somewhat different 
in their points of emphasis than were those which were 
earlier taught in the seventh and eighth grades of the 
elementary school, or in the first years of the four-year 
high school. History was introduced rather generally 
into the program of studies of the secondary schools 
soon after the first quarter of the nineteenth century. 
It is not easy to make the transition in a short length 
of time away from traditional practices to the newer 
content which places more emphasis upon the indus- 
trial, economic and social aspects of history and less 
emphasis upon political and military phases. 
In the third place, history was the subject of the so- 
cial science group which was first introduced into sec- 
ondary schools. Therefore, it has been thoroughly 
intrenched in the program of social studies. Nat- 
urally enough, it is not easy for the advocates of the 
more traditional types of history teaching to come to 
any very definite agreement with the advocates of the 
newer social studies as to what relative prominence 
the other aspects of social studies shall occupy in sec- 
ondary school curricula. These difficulties should not 
be regarded as insuperable but they need to be recog- 
nized as practical curriculum problems. 
Social Studies as Representative of Modes of Liv- 
ing.—The attempt herein is to outline the program of 
studies for secondary schools, chiefly in the spirit of 
subject matter most suitable for the realization of the 
outstanding educational objectives, rather than merely 
in terms of stereotyped separate high school subjects. 
The various groups of subject matter should be
-P-A-G-E-416
394 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
thought of as representing generic types and modes of 
experience in life as a whole. Especially is this point 
of view applicable to social studies, since their chief 
content must be drawn from the modes and ideals of 
living among different peoples. 
This viewpoint does not in any way detract from 
what the historian has for a long time characterized as 
historical perspective or historic-mindedness. There 
is no inconsistency in attempting to interpret past his- 
tory in its proper perspective, and at the same time in 
attempting to put meaning into the content of our 
present-day, newer social studies, which have drawn 
their content from the significant modes of living of a 
people. In short, there is not necessarily any oppo- 
sition between emphasizing historical perspective and, 
at the same time, emphasizing a study of the immediate 
needs, customs, beliefs and ideals of people of current 
times. 
Organized Institutions of Society the Result of a 
Modified, Inherited Gregarious Instinct—The tend- 
ency of many animals is to live in groups. This same 
tendency is expressed on a higher level among human 
beings, and is often characterized by the social psy- 
chologist as the social instinct. Among animals, this 
group instinct manifests itself in too low a degree to 
become actualized in institutional form. Among 
primitive peoples, however, the tribe and the clan do 
represent a more conscious effort to institutionalize in 
more permanent form this modified’ gregarious tend- 
ency. All normal children among the civilized races 
express in various ways and degrees this same social 
tendency, especially in their play-life. In the adoles- 
 
-P-A-G-E-417
  SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 395 
cent stage, one form of manifestation is to be found in 
the organization of clubs, societies, fraternities and so 
forth. In adult life, almost an unlimited number of 
institutions have been based upon the various forms of 
the manifestation of this inherited tendency of people 
to live together in groups. 
The establishment and development of all of these 
modern institutions is indubitable evidence of the in- 
heritance of a fundamental human trait, the tendency 
of human beings to live together in groups, both large 
and small. Much of the subject matter under the so- 
cial studies can be relevantly drawn from this institu- 
tional life, and through this procedure it becomes 
possible to study modes of experience and living 
represented by the people of any generation, together 
with their progress from one generation to another, if 
progress there be. Because of the nature of the 
sources from which history and the other social studies 
draw their materials of instruction for secondary 
schools, it is justifiable to insist that this group of sub- 
jects known as social studies shall find a very prom- 
inent place throughout all of the years covered by sec- 
ondary education. 
The General Nature of the Traditional Type of His- 
tory Taught in Secondary Schools.—Instruction in 
history in secondary education previous to the middle 
of the nineteenth century was very meager. It did 
begin in a way during the eighteenth century at the 
time of the origin of the academy movement. By the 
end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century 
Massachusetts had passed legislation relative to the 
teaching of history in the high schools. By the middle
-P-A-G-E-418
  
  396 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of this century, several of the large cities in the eastern 
part of the United States were offering work in ancient 
and modern history, political economy, the constitu- 
tions of the various states, United States history, the 
Constitution of the United States, philosophy of his- 
tory and the history of civilization. 
The influence of college entrance requirements had a 
good deal to do with the nature of some of the early 
work offered in history in secondary schools. About 
the middle of the nineteenth century history received 
recognition as an entrance credit to college. During 
the last quarter of the century, hundreds of American 
colleges required some work for entrance in American, 
general, Greek, Roman, English or French history. 
The Influence of the Recommendations of Prominent 
History Committees.—A series of committees on 
history instruction have been created during the last 
quarter of a century or more. The Committee of Ten, 
in 1893, made a recommendation to include history 
instruction permanently in secondary schools. The 
influence of the Committee of Seven (1896-1898) rel- 
ative to curriculum practices in history in secondary 
schools has been very strong even up to the present 
time. They recommended the now familiar four 
blocks of history, ancient, medieval and modern, Eng- 
lish history and American history, and civil govern- 
ment. The Committee of Five (1907-1911) made cer- 
tain recommendations as to changes in the amount 
required, in the content and in the sequential order of 
arrangement of these different blocks. 
Various suggestions have been made by other com- 
mittees and individuals during the last ten years with
-P-A-G-E-419
  SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 397 
reference to the modification of these four original 
blocks of history. The chronological order earlier 
stressed is not now emphasized so strongly. Modified 
general history courses, including a world survey es- 
pecially of the modern problems, are now instituted in 
some schools. Large generic unit-topics, interrelated, 
are outlined irrespective of their strict chronological 
sequence. And as previously suggested, the milita- 
ristic and political aspects are reduced to a minimum, 
giving place to those facts having to do with significant 
modes of life in terms of economic, industrial and so- 
cial experience. 
The Connotation of Social Studies and Their Cor- 
relation with History Content.—Closely related to the 
modifications pointed out above relative to history is 
the discussion of the nature and meaning of the phrase 
“‘social studies’’. In its widest sense, this phrase re- 
fers to a body of undifferentiated subjects of study 
which have to do with the vital problems of the every- 
day social life of peoples. In most instances, the 
phrase stands for a group of separate subjects known 
as geography, history, civics, elementary economics 
and sociology. 
With due recognition of all of the present limita- 
tions, the introduction of social studies has produced 
three or four wholesome results already. It has re- 
duced the emphasis placed upon mere mechanical 
chronological order of events. It has, as a conse- 
quence, increased the emphasis to be placed upon psy- 
chological arangement and the presentation of subject 
matter. It has introduced certain phases of commun- 
ity civics which have developed a consciousness of
-P-A-G-E-420
  398 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
civic problems not brought out in the study of the mere 
machinery of the constitution of the separate states 
or of the United States. It has changed the relative 
emphasis for high school pupils from the overem- 
phasized ancient problems in history to a study of 
modern problems. 
Shift of Emphasis from Disciplinary and Informa- 
tional Values of History to the Sociological Needs.— 
Little defense can be made for history on the basis of 
formal mental discipline alone. Whatever justifica- 
tion is to be found in this one-time rather frequent 
claim must be regarded as at least only indirect, and 
as a by-product. Information, unless it serves some 
purpose or functions in some way, cannot be used alone 
as an outstanding value. More important is the so- 
ciological value of history. This does not imply that 
information as such has no value. But it is valua- 
ble largely in proportion as it makes a difference in 
the social life of individuals. Professor Inglis has 
pointed out the fact that history had passed through 
three rather definite stages: First, the ancillary stage 
during which it was intended to assist in a study of 
the classics; second, the informational, during which 
facts were accumulated for their own sake; third, the 
disciplinary, during which it was claimed that certain 
mental processes such as memory, imagination, and 
judgment were exercised and whetted in such a manner 
as to serve one better in any other difficult situation 
whatsoever. Now we should emphasize the sociolog- 
ical value, which is in harmony with Luther’s concep- 
tion of history as a study of institutions and their sig- 
nificance in human living. 
 
-P-A-G-E-421
  SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 399 
The Necessity of Recognizing Some Order of Pro- 
gressive Arrangement in Social Science Instruction.— 
One of the outstanding limitations of the teaching of 
history and social science courses in the past has been 
that too little attention has been given to the sequen- 
tial arrangement of subject matter on increasingly 
higher levels of the ability of pupils. This has been 
true both in secondary schools and in higher institu- 
tions of learning. Certain courses have been so taught 
in the different years of high school and college respec- 
tively, and in such a way, as to demand comparatively 
little more reflective judgment or reasoning relative 
to causal relations in the so-called advance courses 
than in the introductory courses. 
The principle of progression should be applied to the 
organization and presentation of other social studies 
than that of history. In the light of the introduction 
of this mass, or, sometimes, maze of newer materials 
of instruction in the social sciences, great precaution 
needs to be taken lest the pupils of the secondary 
school be led to stop far short of the reflective thinking 
stage in their mental reactions to these materials, often 
with the consciousness perhaps that they are but half 
learned. 
Concrete Examples of the Modifications of View- 
point in Several Representative Schools.—The follow- 
ing general and specific aims were outlined during the 
past year for a secondary school having an enrollment 
of over 1,000 pupils. Certain features of the outline 
reflect in part the spirit and method of procedure for 
which the North Central Association Committee on 
Unit Curricula stands.
-P-A-G-E-422
  400 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Report on the History Department of a Representative 
Secondary School 
The aims are as follows: 
I. General 
1. To increase the social usefulness of the student, using the 
word “social” in its broadest sense 
The individual’s social usefulness depends upon his attitude of 
mind toward social problems. It is highly desirable that each 
should be free from prejudice, should be cautious about making 
snap judgments, and should have an unselfish attitude toward, or be 
altruistic about, public matters. A knowledge of the past is one 
of the ways of promoting this attitude of mind. 
In the second place, he should have a fund of information about, 
and an understanding of, social problems. 
2. To add to the enjoyment of life by the student 
The individual’s enjoyment of life depends upon his number of 
contacts with the world about him. All studies serve to increase 
these, but no one surpasses the social studies in the number and 
variety of contacts which it supplies. They are basic for the full 
enjoyment of art, literature, music, industry, people and travel. 
II. Specific aims 
1. United States History 
a. To acquaint the student with our ideals and our prob- 
lems as a nation through a knowledge of our past. 
This course, and that in civics, should contribute 
primarily to the first general aim. 
2. Civies 
a. To acquaint the student with our form of government 
and with its basic political philosophy 
b. To point out its recognized defects and proposed 
remedies 
e. To point out the strong features of our government and 
the necessity and methods for protecting them 
d. To study the economic and social problems confronting 
us, proposed remedies, and the function of the govern- 
ment in bringing these to pass
-P-A-G-E-423
  SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 401 
e. To inculcate a sense of personal responsibility for the 
success or failure of our government 
3. English History 
a. To study the development of our present political organi- 
zation from the English background 
b. To study our social and economic problems as developed 
out of our Anglo-Saxon past 
ce. To study the processes of adjustment and change present 
in all progressive nations. 
In another secondary school having over 1,000 pupils 
enrolled, the following statement concerning the ob- 
jectives of social science to be attained in high school 
appeared in mimeographed form, as follows: 
History reveals the social and political development of the 
human race. Those receiving instruction should be made intelligent 
with reference to this aim. ... In the presentation of the study 
of successive groups of society, the student is made aware of the 
necessity of tolerance, of living together well, of serving one an- 
other, of obedience to rightful authority, of economic and social 
justice in order that progress may continue... . 
Two worthy objectives in good history teaching which require 
the use of collateral reading for their realization are to create an 
abiding interest in the subject of history, and to establish a per- 
manent desire for substantial historical reading. Worthy home 
membership and worthy use of leisure, two of the cardinal prin- 
ciples of secondary education, may be more readily attained by 
creating life interests and permanent tastes regarding the quantity 
and kind of reading done during life’s leisure hours. 
Of the modern history course offered in this same 
school the following statement is made: 
“A year of modern history is required of all students who 
graduate. This subject is open to sophomores, juniors and seniors, 
but it should be completed if possible during the second year in  
-P-A-G-E-424
  402 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
high school. The period which is covered in this course dates 
from about 1600 to the present time. The purpose of the study of 
modern history is not merely to acquaint students with important 
events and personages of the world during modern times, but to 
give them as thorough understanding and appreciation as possible 
of the period in which they now live and to help fit them to solve 
the various social economic and political problems with which they 
may have to deal in the future.” 
In another high school, enrolling approximately 300, 
the pupils are grouped on the basis of mental tests and 
past scholastic records. Courses are offered for 
pupils not intending to graduate or for those pursuing 
commercial work later. The first year’s course is 
made up of community civics. The second year is 
constituted of world history. The courses intended 
for pupils expecting to enter college and for other 
superior pupils are as follows: First year, ancient 
history; second year, medieval and modern history; 
third year, United States history; fourth year, social 
problems. 
In these schools, one finds in looking over their out- 
lined programs of studies that the influence of the 
traditional practices in history teaching are still ap- 
parent. On the other hand, there is evidence in these 
schools and in many other secondary schools observed, 
that materials are now being actually taught in the 
light of our more recent objectives of education. 
The Status of the Social Sciences in the High Schools 
of the North Central Association—In a questionnaire 
study made by Professor W. 8S. Monroe and Mr. I. O. 
Foster of the high schools belonging to the North 
Central Association, certain interesting facts were dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
    SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 403 
covered. Ancient history was offered in all of the 
four years of high school but predominantly in the 
first and second years. Of the newer subjects, com- 
munity civies is offered primarily in'the first two years, 
as it should be. It is, however, found offered in each 
of the four years, in some high school or other. Mod- 
ern history is offered primarily in the second and third 
years, and American history in the last two years, as 
is true of elementary economics and sociology. These 
facts have a bearing on the previous statement made 
relative to the lack of progressive continuity in history 
and other social studies taught. 
By way of total summary of subjects, it may be 
noted that ancient history, when offered, is given as a 
separate course in over fifty percent of the schools. 
In more than one-third of the schools reporting it is 
required. General history is offered in less than ten 
percent of the schools. American history is the only 
social study which is not found to be offered by some 
one school or other in each of the years of the high 
school. The bearing of this remark upon the perti- 
nence of the previous statement concerning the need of 
the progressive organization of social.science materials 
is obvious. Approximately four-fifths of the high 
schools require American history. Only enough facts 
have been here presented to indicate that the nature 
of the content of history and social studies is different 
from that of a generation or two ago, and that, on the 
other hand, there is need for considerable improve- 
ment, especially with reference to the progressive ar- 
rangement of materials as well as with reference to 
adaptation to the social needs of pupils, and with  
-P-A-G-E-426
  404 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
reference to relative values of the various aspects of 
history and the other social studies. 
The Preparation of Teachers of Social Studies in 
Secondary Education.—Since the present organiza- 
tion of social studies is comparatively so very new, too 
much emphasis cannot be placed upon the proper 
training of social science instructors. This is likewise 
true in the instances of general science and general 
mathematics courses. The preparation of teachers is 
important for consideration under each of the core 
group of subjects. What is here said is therefore ap- 
plicable in spirit to all of the other reorganized high 
school subjects. A quotation from one state only, as 
an example, must suffice. Conclusions given by Pro- 
fessor Edgar Dawson in a bulletin published by the 
United States Bureau of Education read as follows: 
It is of first importance for the university departments of 
economics, government, history, and sociology to unite, under the 
guidance of the experts in education, in the formulation of a group 
course of training in these fields in order that it may be possible 
for the prospective teacher to cover a reasonable amount of the 
various elementary or introductory courses in subject matter. 
The universities should require, not recommend, that those who 
are to be indorsed as teachers of the social studies shall have com- 
pleted this group training before they receive an indorsement. 
This is done in the preparation of persons for other professions, 
and there is no reason why the teaching profession should not 
have as respectable treatment... . 
The plan at the University of California is to present the sub- 
ject matter of the social studies to the prospective teacher through 
cooperation among the departments of economics, government, and 
history, requiring such other courses as these departments and the 
school of education deem advisable in view of the current equip- 
ment of the university. The basic principle is that when a man
-P-A-G-E-427
SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 405 
or woman enters the school of education, it is assumed that he has 
offered himself for training in a profession, just as the prospective 
engineer or lawyer would, and that it is the duty of the university 
to give all the guidance and stimulus that it is able to give. 
The general plan for subject-matter courses outlined at the 
University of California, and to be followed in so far as the dean 
of the school of education finds it possible in the light of the present 
equipment of the several departments, is as follows: 
Twelve units of introductory work, prerequisite to advanced work 
in the field, consisting of 6 units of economics and 6 of either his- 
tory or political science. 
Eighteen units of upper division or senior college work, 6 in 
history, 6 in economies, and 6 in political science, and 6 additional 
units selected by the candidate from one of the foregoing subjects. 
It is assumed that the candidate will take additional work in the 
social studies beyond this minimum, and that his interest in this 
profession will dispose him to include in his work for the bachelor’s 
degree some study of group psychology, ethics, anthropology, or 
social institutions. It is also assumed that the school of education 
will direct that the candidate include in the 36 units of the 
minimum, at least a course in the history of the United States and 
one in general history, and one in comparative government. It is 
further assumed that he will pursue a graduate course based on the 
principles which underlie the organization of a proper course for 
teachers. This means that some professor in one of the social 
studies shall introduce him to the methods and aims of the study 
of man in society, to grasp the meaning of history, political science, 
and of economies as useful fields of thought and research. 
The Fundamental Purpose and Permanent Place of 
Social Studies in the Secondary School Program as a 
Whole.—It has been stated earlier that the human race 
has inherited the fundamental trait or tendency of liv- 
ing together in groups. Sometimes these groups in 
primitive life are large, sometimes small, as is likewise 
true of civilized life. The chief difference between the 
primitive and the civilized groups lies in the ability
-P-A-G-E-428
406 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of individuals to live together non-successfully or suc- 
cessfully. And this statement, vague though it may 
appear to be, in some respects, must represent one of 
the large ultimate purposes of the pursuit of social 
studies by secondary school pupils. 
If this be granted as one of the major ultimate ob- 
jectives of social science teaching, then it is justifiable 
to assert that this social material should constitute a 
relatively large proportion out of the four or five 
groups of subject matter constituting the total pro- 
gram of studies offered by modern secondary schools. 
The commission reporting under the auspices of the 
Association of the Collegiate Schools of Business in 
1922 made an assumption that may be used as a gen- 
eralization in the junior-senior high schools of Amer- 
ica, namely, that ‘‘social studies should be the backbone 
of secondary education.’’ Not all individuals may be 
willing to accept this hypothesis. Social studies, how- 
ever, must occupy a place of very large prominence if 
democracy is to be helped much through the agency of 
secondary education. Social science, too, will con- 
tribute as much, if not more, than any other body of 
subject matter toward the realization of our newer 
secondary school objectives. 
QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION 
1, Suggest several difficulties to be met in the reorganization of 
social science materials in the junior-senior high school.

CHAPTER XXII 
SELECTION AND ORGANIZATION OF SCIENCE- 
MATHEMATICS MATERIALS OF INSTRUC- 
TION IN THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH 
SCHOOL 
Comparison of Science and Mathematics with His- 
tory and Literature as Modes of Experience.—The 
ideals and activities in modes of human experience 
represented by science and mathematics content are 
different from those represented by the content of 
literature or history. Systematized knowledge devel- 
oped through the use of scientific method and research 
is, perhaps, the outstanding characteristic of the 
science mode of experience at its best. Axiomatic 
truth is characteristic of mathematics content. In the 
ease of science, contrary to the history or literature 
mode of experience, under controlled laboratory and 
experimental conditions a situation or experience may 
be reproduced. In other words, much of science ma- 
terial lends itself to redemonstration. Mathematics 
content lends itself also to accurate proof and demon- 
stration. Furthermore, in the instance of mathe- 
matics, experience in the form of statements of truth 
is highly stabilized. Mathematical facts remain rela- 
tively unchanged as contrasted to facts having to do 
with social experience reflected through the social 
409 
V A
-P-A-G-E-432
  410 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
studies, or through literature. We are accustomed to 
speak of the high degree of accuracy of method and of 
results in the field of science and mathematics. The 
above statements refer to science and mathematics at 
their best, characteristic of the mode of experience of 
the expert or specialist, in these respective fields. 
The Science Mode of Experience Not Limited to the 
Specialist—The development of modern civilization 
through scientific research has been incalculably great. 
The influence upon modern civilization of inventions 
in the fields of industry and that of travel and methods 
of communication, have been overwhelmingly large. 
Applied science and mathematics have inevitably led 
us to a mode of experience very different from that 
of the mind of primitive peoples, or from that of the 
simple life of the Colonial period of our own American 
history. 
In what way is it possible to train pupils to sense 
and appreciate the science and mathematical mode of 
experience in its widest bearing? This represents one 
of the major problems of secondary schools. For con- 
venience of discussion, Spencer’s question, What 
knowledge is of most worth? may be modified to read: 
How is it possible to make science subject matter most 
worthwhile on different levels in the junior-senior high 
school? Because of the progress made in our civiliza- 
tion due to applied science and mathematics, it is use- 
less to argue that this mode of experience should not 
be included in secondary school curricula. It will 
herein be assumed that science and mathematics con- 
tent furnish one of the fundamental modes of human 
experience and consequently a minimum amount should
-P-A-G-E-433
MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 411 
be strongly entrenched in the program of studies of 
all secondary schools. 
Mental Discipline Not the Sole Value of Science and 
Mathematics Training —From the days of John Locke, 
and earlier, down to the present time, mathematics has 
been justified by some persons, in the program of 
studies, on the ground that the study of mathematics 
trains the mind so that it will do better work in any 
other field, related or unrelated, of thought or activity. 
A certain percentage of high school instructors still 
enthusiastically defend the pursuit of mathematics on 
the ground of its mental disciplinary value. As is well 
known, Spencer, after justifying the pursuit of science 
on the basis of the needs of society, finally attempted 
also to defend it on the grounds of its value in terms 
of formal discipline. Again, a certain percentage of 
instructors in high school science at the present time 
use largely this same disciplinary criterion to measure 
the value of science instruction. 
No one will deny that training in certain mental 
techniques does result from the study of science, as 
well as from the study of mathematics. The training 
in method in science is different from that gained from 
the study of language, literature or history. Certain 
attitudes are developed enabling the pupil to appre- 
ciate the problem of science and its contributions to 
civilization as a whole. The training in problem- 
solving in mathematics is somewhat different from that 
acquired through a training in any one of most of the 
other high school subjects. In elementary mathe- 
matics these problems may be made concrete and real- 
istic, as, for instance, in the teaching of concrete
-P-A-G-E-434
412 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
geometry. In more advanced mathematics of even the 
later years of high school and of the junior college, 
this problem-solving experience becomes more and 
more abstract in the processes involved. It is per- 
tinent to suggest that training in problem-solving may 
be acquired by secondary school pupils through in- 
struction in either science or mathematics. The large 
general mode of experience, however, which is most 
valuable for junior high school pupils and for pupils 
in the earlier years of the four-year high school, or of 
the three-year senior high school, is that expressed 
chiefly in terms of social values. This has been recog- 
nized by the recent National Committee on Mathemat- 
ical Requirements in secondary education. 
Contribution of Science to Educational Objectives.— 
The more limited and narrow earlier claims made for 
the training of pupils in science and mathematics have 
been modified and revised in the light of present edu- 
cational objectives in secondary education. The Re- 
port on the Reorganization of Science in Secondary 
Schools states the aims and purposes of science teach- 
ing with reference to six of the seven now widely 
accepted educational objectives and then briefly sug- 
gests how this may be done in relation to health and 
other objectives. It does not overlook, however, other 
values which are designated as more specific, such as 
the development of interests in various fields of 
science, ability to solve problems and the acquisition 
of useful information as well as training for culture 
and esthetic appreciation. 
Introductory Science and Introductory Mathematics 
in the Junior High School Cycle—General science
-P-A-G-E-435
  MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 413 
and general mathematics are made up of composite 
elements of science and mathematics content respec- 
tively. General science is constituted of a body of 
facts, or of large unit aspects taken from all of the 
separate high school science subjects included in the 
biological, physical and earth science groups. Its 
purpose is to represent a mode of experience in undif- 
ferentiated form, and having meaning in terms of, the 
everyday lives of pupils. General mathematics is con- 
stituted of certain aspects of arithmetic, elementary 
algebra, concrete geometry and elementary trigonom- 
etry. Here, as is true in general science, the chief 
concern is in presenting materials of such a type, and 
presenting them in such a manner, as will best meet 
the aptitudes, and attitudes and interests, of immature 
high school pupils. No attempt is made to specialize 
in any particular science, except in so far as it assists 
in understanding and appreciating the pupil’s modes 
of experience in common with other individuals, or in 
furnishing a cross-sectional survey of the pupil’s inter- 
ests in the science content of materials, or in providing 
a preliminary preparation for the more specialized 
study of more advanced special subjects in science. 
In general, with some variations, the same thing may 
be said of general mathematics. 
The Psychological Organization and Presentation of 
Subject Matter in Both Science and Mathematics.— 
The chief purpose of instruction in introductory 
science and mathematics is not the production of 
miniature expert scientists and mathematicians. One 
of the outstanding ultimate purposes is to acquaint 
pupils with two great modes of experience that are
-P-A-G-E-436
  414 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
realistic in nature, and which function in life every 
day, everywhere about them. Separate high school 
subjects in science and mathematics are usually too 
highly specialized as found outlined in the ordinary 
textbooks. The organization is logically done, but it 
is ill-adapted to the minds of learners so immature as 
are junior high school pupils. Introductory science 
and mathematics should be organized and presented 
during the earlier years of the junior-senior high 
school in terms of the interests and abilities of the 
pupils. 
Later on in the junior-senior high school courses 
offered in the two above-named fields it will be possi- 
ble to lead the pupil profitably through a more and 
more logically organized set of materials. At this 
stage it should be possible for pupils to do a higher 
type of reflective thinking than has usually been done 
under our past practices. The procedure here argued 
for is for the purpose of furnishing an opportunity to 
do a more satisfactory type of abstract thinking, which 
we have been striving in vain to have the high school 
pupils do. But this higher type of thinking process 
must gradually develop out of a background of mean- 
ingful and realistic concrete experiences. 
The psychological, and the logical, organizations and 
presentations of science and mathematics materials 
are not opposed to one another. The psychological 
gradually prepares the way for the pupil to make a 
profitable educational transition to the logical. Just 
because science and mathematics as well as foreign 
languages have been so long in vogue, and have come 
to be so highly perfected, it is all the more necessary 
 
-P-A-G-E-437
MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 415 
to insist that efforts be made to adapt the materials of 
instruction in these fields to the aptitudes and interests 
of pupils, individually and socially considered. 
The administration of this science-mathematics sub- 
ject matter is a definite problem for the consideration 
of school officers. In certain instances it might be 
possible to outline courses for certain groups where 
the overlapping problems of science and mathematics, 
so far as content is concerned, might be taught in a 
single course or more. In a limited number of in- 
stances it might be justifiable to allow pupils to 
choose either introductory science or mathematics 
courses providing that the training in the technique of 
method and experience in problem-solving was brought 
out in each set of courses. After these general modes 
of experience have once become the common posses- 
sion of all the pupils, pupils should be allowed more 
and more freedom to choose during the later years of 
the senior high school between the pursuit of further 
science or mathematical study, and the pursuit of 
studies representing other modes of experience. Here, 
as was pointed out in the instance of social studies, it 
is highly desirable to keep in mind the need of a pro- 
gressive order of arrangement of materials to be 
taught during the two three-year cycles of the junior- 
senior high school. 
The Point of View of the Committee on Unit Curric- 
ula of the North Central Association.—A sub-commit- 
tee of the Committee on Unit Curricula of the North 
Central Association has made a preliminary out- 
line of illustrative material for the purpose of 
setting forth a viewpoint and pattern method of pro-
-P-A-G-E-438
416 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
cedure in establishing standards in science teaching in 
secondary schools. <A brief outline is given below of 
materials outlined in harmony with the objectives 
of the North Central Association. Some of these ma- 
terials should be made optional, some of them should 
be required. This will depend somewhat upon the 
local situation. Some of the material, if it seems to 
be too complex, should be subject also to modification 
to suit conditions. It should be noted that the order 
of topics suggested, in any instance, should be shifted 
at will by the instructor. No attempt is made to list 
these topics either in order of sequence or in order of 
importance. In the reports of other committees cer- 
tain attitudes and recommendations have been ex- 
pressed both with reference to the nature of the con- 
tent of science in secondary schools and with reference 
to the amount of time given to the teaching of this 
phase of subject matter. For example, the Iowa State 
Teachers’ Association, in its report made several years 
ago, registered the conviction that ‘‘from the stand- 
point of universal values, English, the social studies, 
and science (including closely allied subjects in the 
field of practical arts) are regarded as important”’. 
This same committee made the specific recommenda- 
tion that ‘‘general science should be offered for one 
year and should be required of all students’’. The 
committee also outlined a suggestive course in general 
science and designated certain types of materials to be 
used in the discussion of ‘‘The Problem of Health’’. 
As already stated, the National Education Associa- 
tion Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary 
Education in its report registered the conviction that
-P-A-G-E-439
  MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 417 
science teaching and subject matter used in secondary 
schools should be outlined in terms of the main objec- 
tives of education. It indicated certain type topics to 
be discussed in the field of general science, namely, 
**(1) combustion, (2) water, (3) the air and weather, 
(4) light and its benefits, (5) work and energy, (6) 
magnetism and electricity, (7) nature’s balance of 
life’. Futhermore, this same committee refers 
briefly to the necessity of presenting science in the 
‘‘problem’’ form, as arising out of the pupil’s expe- 
rience. Its work should be recognized so far as it 
proceeded in the reformulation of science teaching, and 
in the reorganization of the content of subject matter 
in terms of educational objectives. 
The North Central Association Committee on Unit 
Curricula is attempting to carry forward the reorgani- 
zation of secondary school subjects with its chief em- 
phasis placed upon the method of approach. Its 
discussion involves a four-fold division of major objec- 
tives in education, namely, health, social activity, vo- 
cational activity and leisure-time activity. In the 
field of science there has been no attempt so far in this 
preliminary survey to go beyond the field of the first 
year, or introductory science of the six-year secondary 
school. It was necessary to limit the field thus, be- 
eause of the impossibility of attempting successfully 
to recast immediately the subject matter of all of the 
sciences taught in the secondary school. The Com- 
mittee plans to carry forward its study through the 
respective high school science subjects. 
Furthermore, great leeway relative to the arrange- 
ment and order of topics taught should be allowed,
-P-A-G-E-440
  418 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
dependent upon many varying conditions within 
respective school systems. However, it is pertinent 
to suggest that it is essential to keep in mind the need 
of some sequential order or arrangement of subject 
matter taught. Otherwise, chaos even worse than 
that previous to our attempts to reorganize science in 
secondary schools will be the result. The need for 
this precaution is evidenced in making even a cursory 
examination of the numerous books and syllabi that 
have already been published in the field of introductory 
science. The content of subject matter is much more 
profitably taught when outlined in larger units than 
in mere fragments. Four general comments are 
pertinent. In the first place, it is doubtful whether 
introductory science, when taught without practically 
any demonstration or experimental work, is serving 
its best purpose in terms of the accepted educational 
objectives, so far as the realization of the objectives 
in the lives and experiences of the pupils is concerned. 
In the second place, without dogmatism in any sense, 
it is believed that at least a total of a year of elemen- 
tary science similar to that suggested through the 
method of approach recommended by the Committee 
on Unit Curricula of the North Central Association 
should be offered within the scope of the junior-senior 
high school. The most suitable year in which it can 
be offered must perhaps be determined by local con- 
ditions, granted, however, that it should be done in the 
ninth grade or below. In the third place, the content 
of the material presented was submitted to a limited 
number of science teachers in secondary schools for 
their approval and criticism. The material should be
-P-A-G-E-441
  MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 419 
reacted to by a large number of actual teachers of 
elementary sciences and the virtues and limitations of 
both the method of approach and the content of sub- 
ject matter checked up in the light of schoolroom prac- 
tice. In the fourth place, as has been indicated in the 
instance of physical education and the academic sub- 
jects so far reported upon, all of the subject matter 
outlined below is intended to be chiefly illustrative and 
suggestive, rather than final or fully conclusive. 
Introductory or elementary science contributes to 
the different secondary school objectives in varying 
proportions. It no doubt contributes most largely and 
directly to the health and the vocational objectives. 
At certain points or in certain aspects, it contributes 
also to both the social and leisure objectives. As is 
true in other school subjects, a certain amount of 
repetition of subject matter in the use of this method 
of approach will appear, under the various captions 
and subdivisions of knowledge, interests, ideals and 
habits or skills. But again, this method of approach 
must not become too stilted and stereotyped in its use. 
The outline referred to in the first paragraph under

Principles of Correlation—Though no explicit refer- 
ence has been made in this chapter to the use of the 
principle of correlation, this principle has been as- 
sumed in the discussion of the combined modes of 
science and mathematics experiences. The correla- 
tion of science and mathematics work with certain 
phases of English, and with geography or other social 
studies, is also possible. The realization of the health 
objective alone is a concrete example of the need of 
relating science to the several other school subjects. 
Preparation of Teachers in High School Science and 
Mathematics.—It has been assumed throughout the 
discussion of this chapter, as in the instance of the 
teaching of the language and social science groups of 
subject matter, that it will require well-prepared 
teachers to succeed in the presentation of this over- 
whelming mass of detailed science and mathematics 
material. In the main, the same type of preparation 
which was outlined in the previous chapter for teachers 
of social studies should obtain with reference to 
teachers of science and mathematics. 
The Value of the Stabilizing Influence of Science 
and Mathematics.—Thus far in the discussion of the 
groups of subject matter, three great composite modes 
of human experience have been suggested, namely, the 
linguistic, the social and the scientific. All three of 
these generic aspects of life may be considered largely 
in terms of their application to daily life. This, how-
-P-A-G-E-445
MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 423 
ever, is primarily the privilege and work of the expert 
in its most refined stage. Fundamental guiding prin- 
ciples and laws represent the thought of specialists in 
the respective modes of human experience, and es- 
pecially is it true that laws developed in the fields of 
science and mathematics are, relatively speaking, very 
permanent. Though the Ptolemaic system did in time 
give way to the Copernican theory, and other great 
earlier scientific concepts have given way to those 
more modern, still the general effect of science and 
mathematical laws is to stabilize human experience 
over many generations of time. Therefore, in the 
midst of our changing social conceptions this stabiliz- 
ing aspect represents one mode of experience impor- 
tant for the secondary school pupil to appreciate, in 
part, in the whole of his school training. The sensing 
of these laws developed is the more difficult and ad- 
vanced phase of the study of science-mathematics 
content. 
The application of science-mathematics materials in 
terms of social life furnishes an easier beginning point 
for the immature pupil than beginning with a study of 
science in its highly perfected form. It is therefore 
appropriate to suggest that these materials be or- 
ganized and presented in such a manner that they will 
become socialized, and that this presentation will fur- 
nish the motivated opportunity for pupils to realize 
later the more abstract processes involved leading to 
the development of permanent laws and axioms. For 
the preliminary organization of such materials the 
reader is referred to the recent bulletins published by
-P-A-G-E-446
  424 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the United States Bureau of Education, to the view- 
point represented by the North Central Association, 
and to some of the more recent practices now carried 
on in modern secondary school systems. 
QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION 
1. In what respect do the modes of experience represented by 
the subject matter under science and mathematics differ from those 
under literature and history? 
2. Show that the science mode of experience is not limited to the 
realm of expert opinion.

the implication for secondary education in method of presentation, 
and in organization of subject matter? 
7. Compare the point of view of the North Central Association 
Unit Curricula Committee on the Organization of Science Material 
with that usually held in the past in the formulation of courses in 
science.

  CHAPTER XXIII 
SELECTION AND ORGANIZATION OF PRAC- 
TICAL ARTS AND FINE ARTS MATERIALS 
OF INSTRUCTION IN THE JUNIOR- 
SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
A. Practical Arts 
Prejudice against the Practical Arts in Secondary 
Schools.—Unfavorable attitudes or prejudices some- 
what akin to what Bacon called ‘‘idols of the den,’’ 
have frequently been expressed with reference to the 
inclusion of practical arts in the program of studies of 
the secondary school. Sometimes, practical arts sub- 
jects have been looked upon as less worthy of study 
relative to their cultural effects than are the so-called 
academic subjects. Furthermore, it has been sug- 
gested that this newer subject matter is as yet very 
poorly standardized. The last statement contains a 
certain element of truth. 
It does not appear to be justifiable to assume that a 
hierarchy of subject matter exists, with the academic 
subjects at the top, and practical arts at the bottom. 
No school subject, per se, in modern secondary educa- 
tion is superior to another subject. In harmony with 
the discussion in the previous chapters that have to 
do, chiefly, with the content of the subject matter in 
secondary education, it is here assumed that the prac- 
426
-P-A-G-E-449
PRACTICAL AND FINE ARTS MATERIALS 427 
tical arts represent one significant composite mode of 
experience. The content is different from that rep- 
resented by the academic subjects, but not less impor- 
tant. It is a phase of human interest that has grad- 
ually developed out of the growing complexity of 
modern life. Furthermore, some phase of industrial 
art has always been expressed in one form or another. 
Through training in the practical arts it is possible to 
develop in individuals both a technique in the various 
kinds of skill, and also a wholesome attitude toward, 
and an appreciation of, these skills. 
One psychological difference between practical arts 
and academic high school subjects is that the former 
emphasizes, primarily, skills, and the latter, knowl- 
edges and attitudes. In manual training, agricultural, 
commercial and industrial work, there is less tendency 
to analyze processes involved in the learning of skills 
than is true in the case of some of the academic sub- 
jects. To use Professor Judd’s phraseology in rela- 
tion to experience, practical arts consist of a series 
of coérdinated ‘‘sensory,’’ ‘‘tactual’’ and ‘‘visual’’ 
controls. Such activities usually remain for many 
individuals on the level of habit. It is possible to de- 
velop an analytical consciousness, however, with ref- 
erence to the experience involved in connection with 
the subject matter of practical arts inside and outside 
of the schoolroom. This leads one to remark that if 
the subject matter of practical arts is presented in a 
thoroughgoing manner it may eventually lead a limited 
number of pupils to do a very satisfactory type of 
abstract and analytical thinking. The natural tend- 
ency is to allow pupils who participate in practical
-P-A-G-E-450
  428 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
arts work to remain on the habit level permanently. 
Historical Development of Practical Arts.—Foreign 
languages, mathematics and science got an early start 
in the high school program of studies as contrasted 
with the practical arts. Intermittently, and piece- 
meal, practical arts were included during the middle 
of the nineteenth century. But it was not until the 
last quarter of the century that manual arts, house- 
hold arts and commercial subjects were really incor- 
porated in a very general way in secondary schools. 
The impetus for developing the manual arts came 
about through the earlier efforts put forth in the 
Middle West, and especially in St. Louis. The estab- 
lishment of land grant colleges in the sixties, and the 
origin of agricultural high schools in connection with 
agricultural colleges led the way, in part, in vocational 
education in the United States. Household arts grew 
up out of trade courses offered for girls in the State 
of New York and in Massachusetts. 
The Earlier Disciplinary Purpose Claimed for Prac- 
tical Arts Subjects, Now Modified.—Strangely, and 
inconsistently enough, too, the practical arts subjects 
were defended at the outset on the usual basis of the 
inclusion of all other school subjects that had been 
introduced, namely, mental discipline. Earlier edu- 
cational literature is replete with the claims of the 
formal discipline value of manual training, agriculture, 
bookkeeping and stenography. It is much more jus- 
tifiable to defend the subject matter offered under the 
practical arts subjects in terms of our present-day 
social, vocational and even leisure-time objectives than
-P-A-G-E-451
PRACTICAL AND FINE ARTS MATERIALS 429 
to try to save them to the program of studies chiefly 
on the ground of their disciplinary value. 
Difficulties in the Standardization of Materials 
One difficulty relative to the standardization of the 
practical arts material grows out of the fact that so 
much of the content is new, and that it covers almost 
an unlimited range of activities and experiences of 
individuals as a whole. Another difficulty grows out 
of the fact that teachers as a whole have not been as 
thoroughly trained in this field as in the academic sub- 
jects. A third difficulty is to be found in the fact that 
it is not easy to engraft it into our academic high 
school system, due to the fact that suitable buildings 
and equipment for practical work are lacking. 
Objectives with Reference to Vocational Education, 
According to the Viewpoint of the North Central 
Association Committee on Unit Curricula 
Introduction—The application of the organized system of objec- 
tives to the problems of vocational education as herewith presented 
does not attempt to cover the field exhaustively. It is the plan of 
the committee merely to show that in the field of vocational educa- 
tion the same objectives apply as in every other department 
of secondary education. It is not the plan to give a quantita- 
tive definition of bodies of subject matter divided into units of 
study. The illustrative material is selected merely for the purpose 
of showing how the various objectives function in the field of 
handicraft subjects. In this connection, it should be said that vo- 
cational education as herein used refers to handicraft skills which 
are given on the high school level, and does not apply to the com- 
plete conception of vocational education which in its comprehensive 
form takes in all sorts of education reaching into the professional 
levels.

in a rather miscellaneous fashion from a number of current voca- 
tions. Not all of the objectives outlined are thus illustrated, the

earriage-making, commercial blacksmithing, and de-

mechanies, commercial art, commercial chemistry,

Tendency to Use Projects in Practical Arts Teach- 
ing.—The nature of the materials to be taught in the 
field of practical arts makes it possible to use the 
project-method of curriculum making. This method is 
now being widely used, for example, in the work in 
agriculture. There are certain virtues in projecting 
the work in manual arts and household arts as well as 
in agriculture. But great precaution needs to be taken 
lest considerable of the work done may lack a realistic 
purpose. The origin of the project-method is closely 
allied to the problem-solving attitude of mind in which 
the learner is presumed to be definitely conscious of a 
problem, in which he makes an analysis of the problem 
confronting him and finally succeeds in making an 
actual satisfactory solution. Furthermore, precaution 
is needed lest there be a lack of unity and continuity 
in such work. 
Coéperation of Instructors in Pupil Guidance.—The 
training received by pupils through the pursuit of 
practical arts may serve in some respects as the basis 
of pupil-guidance relative to courses of study chosen, 
and relative to the selection of life-career vocations. 
Certainly the primary purpose of the teaching of prac- 
tical arts in secondary schools is not vocational, and 
not even pre-vocational in many respects. Neverthe- 
   
-P-A-G-E-455
  PRACTICAL AND FINE ARTS MATERIALS 433 
less, no group of subjects lends itself better to assist- 
ance in pupil-guidance, educational and vocational, 
than the practical arts. It is the duty of all high 
school instructors to assist wherever possible in pupil- 
guidance, but the instructors in practical arts should 
make a special effort to codperate in effective guid- 
ance. It is possible to make the mode of experience 
connected with the practical arts in secondary schools 
contribute more largely to the social and vocational 
objectives than has been true in past practice. From 
the discussion under this last section, it should not be 
inferred that practical arts are to be justified chiefly 
on the ground of what they do to prepare pupils for 
trade and vocational life. Practical arts in secondary 
schools should offer a general training in a mode of 
experience regarded as complementary, not opposed, 
to that acquired in the pursuit of academic studies. 
In harmony with one of the views expressed at one 
time by Rousseau, during the eighteenth century, this 
will mean that pupils will be more able to appreciate 
the problems in the various aspects of industrial 
and business life, an attitude which in our day is even 
more consequential than during the eighteenth cen- 
tury. 
Music and other fine arts are relatively important 
enough in secondary education to be given treatment 
in a separate chapter. But it is only possible in this 
instance to indicate certain general principles. In no 
instance does it appear to be justifiable to regard 
music and the fine arts as merely extra-curricular 
materials. They should be considered as an integral 
part of the secondary school program of studies.  
-P-A-G-E-456
    434 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
B. Music and Other Fine Arts 
The Relative Historical Position of the Fine Arts.— 
The esthetic ideals and modes of experience appeared 
very early in both civilized and uncivilized life. 
Every one is familiar with the importance accorded 
to the concept of the beautiful among the Greeks. 
The fine arts served as the tools or means through 
which all other phases of experience were realized. 
Music, according to Plato and Aristotle, was designed 
for the ‘‘soul’’, as was ‘‘gymnastics for the body’’. 
The writings of both of these ancient educators are 
replete with comments on the high service to be ren- 
dered through music. Peculiarly enough, the fine arts 
have never occupied a sufficiently prominent place in 
American secondary schools until recent times. Fre- 
quently, the subject matter under fine arts has been 
referred to as fanciful ‘‘fads’’ of the school system. 
Fine arts in their more comprehensive sense were not 
seriously introduced into the secondary .schools until 
late in the nineteenth century, though some music, 
certain phases of drawing and certain aspects of the 
study of literature did contribute intermittently to this 
esthetic mode of experience earlier. At the present 
time, training in esthetic experience is carried on di- 
rectly and indirectly through the subject matter rep- 
resented in connection with a variety of aspects of 
music, drawing, painting, design, household arts, in- 
dustrial arts and literature. It should be noticed that 
training in esthetic experience and appreciation has 
been given for many years through literature, and
-P-A-G-E-457
  PRACTICAL AND FINE ARTS MATERIALS 435 
that English teachers, in the presentation of certain 
masterpieces, still emphasize this aspect. 
On first thought, the esthetic arts may appear to be 
an experience quite the opposite from practical arts. 
This is true in some measure. On the other hand, 
there is evidence that some forms of decorative art 
earlier developed out of very practical settings. 
Gourds and dippers, for example, once used by certain 
primitive peoples, were made the basis of artistic 
designs. The history of art will show numerous sim- 
ilar examples. It is possible to correlate the work in 
industrial arts with that in fine arts in secondary 
schools at the present time. The possibility of various 
interrelations between fine arts and many aspects of 
other high school subjects is an added illustration of 
the legitimately overlapping modes of human expe- 
rience and interests. 
The Psychological Factors Involved in Fine Arts.— 
The materials of the fine arts appeal to the emotional 
life or the affective consciousness of individuals. Ap- 
preciation is the general name used to characterize the 
mode of experience realized in the esthetic arts. This 
does not imply, as has sometimes been assumed, that 
the emotional tone of experience is less consequential 
than the more intellectualistic phases. It represents, 
once more, one of the important complementary modes 
of experience of life in toto. Esthetic experience is 
more than a mere attitude of passivity. In many re- 
spects this element of affective consciousness, or feel- 
ing, represents the real dynamic of the educative 
process. No pupil’s secondary education is complete
-P-A-G-E-458
  436 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
without some opportunity for training in the finer 
emotional traits and modes of human experience. 
The Adaptation of Esthetic Materials to Educa- 
tional Objectives.—In the illustrative materials, out- 
lined for the teaching of seventh, eighth and ninth 
grade English by the Committee on Unit Curricula of 
the North Central Association, will be found illustra- 
tive types of literature that lend themselves to the 
development of esthetic experience. The nature of the 
content of much of our best literature is especially well 
adapted to realizing the social and leisure objectives 
of secondary education. The same is true of the teach- 
ing of literature in the senior high school. Good au- 
thorities are in agreement with the statement that 
literature may be profitably taught in secondary 
schools as representing one important phase of the 
social science mode of experience. In addition to the 
attempt to treat classics in a more technical way than 
is done in the junior high school, it is justifiable to 
continue the study of literature even above the junior 
high school years with some reference to the realiza- 
tion of the social objective of education. 
Music the Most Widely Organized Phase of Esthetic 
Arts in Secondary Education.—Ever since the close of 
the first quarter of the nineteenth century, a certain 
amount of sporadic effort has been given to high 
school music. In the first instance, as well as at the 
present time, this phase of work has been emphasized 
more for girls than for boys. There is no good 
reason, however, why this mode of experience should 
not also be a common possession of high school boys,
-P-A-G-E-459
  
PRACTICAL AND FINE ARTS MATERIALS 437 
with reference to training in the ability both to render, 
and to appreciate, music. 
The possibility of music materials contributing to 
the social and leisure-time objectives is so common- 
place as to need mere mention. The development of 
the inherited social instinct through musical apprecia- 
tion may be refined into what may become a real con- 
sciousness of a group feeling of solidarity in the com- 
munity. Music festivals galore now give testimony 
to the value of this aspect in the realization of the 
leisure-time objective. And for a limited number of 
the more gifted pupils of the secondary schools, it may 
also contribute to the vocational objective. 
Fine Arts Bulletin of the Department of Education 
of the State of Minnesota.—There are now numerous 
evidences of the fact that fine arts are gaining wider 
recognition in the program of studies of secondary 
schools. Syllabi published by local high schools are 
now common. The art bulletin published by the De- 
partment of Education of the State of Minnesota con- 
tains a number of interesting and encouraging fea- 
tures relative to the place, importance and nature of 
fine arts work in secondary schools. 
To quote: 
Under wise guidance, high school children may be led to abstract 
the same artistic principles from experiences employing widely dif- 
ferent applications. The composition of a page of type with cuts 
ean be made to yield the opportunity for the same kind of judgments 
of harmonious space relations as the designing of a wall area with 
its subdivisions of space by the doors, windows and mouldings. 
Instead, therefore, of dictating a set of problems (which logically 
should vary with local conditions), our recommendation stresses the
-P-A-G-E-460
  438 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
application of definite art principles and suggests a list of optional 
applications. .. . 
The processes in the appended outlines have been listed, in so 
far as possible, in order of difficulty. We advise that each child 
be helped to self-realization as producer, consumer, and dispenser 
in accordance with the ethical and artistie principles listed, through 
manipulation of as many materials as is feasible. . . . 
Many teachers not designated art teachers have been exposed to 
the stimulations of the arts and have the vision, sympathy, and 
tact to inspire in pupils an enthusiasm similar to that with which 
they have themselves responded. Such teachers have contributions 
to make to the experience of the pupils in the three groups of 
subjects treated in this syllabus. . . . 
Your committee believes that to permeate with Art the present 
so-called “academic” course would be of greater value than to re- 
quire merely a certain number of manipulations of material, or the 
manufacture of a certain number of “artistic” products. Art is a 
sterile thing unless it interpenetrates all the activities of life. It 
cannot thrive in isolation. Art education must blend with all the 
courses in the school. The home economics teacher must use it to 
make a dress not only neat and warm, but beautiful; the industrial 
arts teacher must use it to make a table not only steady and sturdy, 
but well proportioned and fine in line; the English teacher must use 
its principles of proportion, symmetry, subordination in theme 
writing, and its products for illustration; the history teacher draws 
much of his information from sources which have been preserved as 
records because they were cherished for their art. With a corps of 
teachers awakened to the possibilities of their courses for stimulat- 
ing ereativeness and appreciation on the part of the pupils, a 
school system could do without a special teacher of drawing and 
design; but because psychology shows the advantage of acting in 
order to clinch an idea, we feel that more manipulation of material 
is necessary. This material can be manipulated skillfully by the 
home economies teacher or the industrial teacher. In the ideal 
situation these persons will have the artistic vision and will have 
spent time in training their esthetic judgment. In many cases, 
however, the necessary subject matter and techniques have crowded 
out the more esthetic phases of their training. We therefore ad-    
-P-A-G-E-461
  PRACTICAL AND FINE ARTS MATERIALS 439 
vocate the employment of an art-trained teacher to work with and 
for these others, to exchange her knowledge and skills for theirs, 
to the end that all may profit. A paper design that will not work 
out in the material is as much of a failure as a well made piece 
of woodwork that is badly proportioned and crude in line. We 
must break down fancied barriers between departments and help 
each other if we are to deserve our places in the field of education. 
This outline purposely refrains from mentioning where the “manip- 
ulation of material” is to take place. It should be in the depart- 
ment and under the teacher best equipped to handle it. 
Difficulty of Standardizing Fine Arts Material._— 
The very nature of esthetic materials makes it difficult 
to standardize all of their phases. Certain routine 
aspects and skills can be standardized rather easily. 
But a large part of the work having to do with the 
finer emotions and tastes does not so easily lend itself 
to mechanical organization. It is evident, however, 
that esthetic subject matter, when presented in a mas- 
terly way, does represent a cross section of an impor- 
tant mode of experience in the life of the pupil in the 
secondary school. Furthermore, through these ma- 
terials a large contribution may be made to a number 
of the secondary school objectives, out of which num- 
ber the social, leisure-time, citizenship and, in part, 
the vocational, are important.

CHAPTER XXIV 
THE ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
OF HEALTH AND OTHER CORRELATED 
ACTIVITIES OF THE JUNIOR-SENIOR 
HIGH SCHOOL 
A. Health Activities and Physical Education 
The Newer Attitude toward Health Education —A 
renewed and intelligent interest has been taken in the 
whole program of organized and directed health ac- 
tivities of the modern high school during the last ten 
years or more. Admittedly only a mere beginning 
has been made. But the viewpoint of the public mind 
is changing. Physical education now seems very 
likely to become universally recognized by all pro- 
gressive people as an important part of secondary 
school systems. Athletics has frequently in the past 
occupied the major part of the time allotted to physical 
education, and should remain as a part of the larger 
program of health activities now being organized. It 
is desirable to retain athletics in its most wholesome 
form under the competent direction of well-trained 
coaches and instructors for the sake of giving expres- 
sion to the free play-life of the pupil. Three impor- 
tant aspects of physical education consist of the free 
play-life developed within the school, the reorganized 
type of gymnastic work and corrective work. In other 
443
-P-A-G-E-466
    444 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
words, any well-organized department of physical ed- 
ucation should include, as a minimum, three aspects: 
1. Medical inspection and supervision; 2. physical in- 
struction in hygiene, and recreational activities; 
3. health instruction and guidance for in-school and 
extra-school experience. 
The incorporation of corrective gymnastics in the 
school is an indication of one of the many newer at- 
titudes taken in the field of physical education. It has 
become the practice in many schools to give all en- 
trants physical examinations and medical inspection. 
It has become customary already for school officers to 
preserve these records of physical examinations for 
the full time that the pupil remains in school. Ina 
limited number of instances, these records have been 
asked for and used by occupational institutions at the 
time of the employment of these former pupils. Good 
reasons may be given why such records should be 
preserved and made available for higher institutions 
of learning and for other types of institutions, includ- 
ing the industrial, if asked for. 
There is no reason why a prolonged argument should 
need to be offered here in defense of a worth-while 
physical education and health program. The fact 
that this work usually should not cease when formal 
school training ends is partial justification. The 
health objective, too, of secondary education is some- 
thing on which the American people as a whole should 
be able to agree. The expansion of physical education 
departments so as to include all aspects essential to 
health will assist greatly in the fuller realization of 
the health aim.
-P-A-G-E-467
  HEALTH AND OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 445 
Opportunity for many pupils to participate in 
athletics, rather than the limitation of work to the 
few who are so highly gifted as to become ‘‘stars’’ 
represents a wholesome present-day tendency. The 
spectators’ benches represent occasional opportu- 
nity for one legitimate type recreation, but this 
phase should by no means be 
physical education. Teachin 
ondary schools to play wholego 
constantly is no mean task to be 
jest or sneering remark of the astute scholar. In the 
healthy buoyancy of the pupils of our secondary 
schools, many times seeming to express itself in what 
appears to the onlooker to be little more than boister- 
ous mob hilarity, is to be found an experience which, 
if directed, will assist in solving “ aspects of our 
     
    
   ry pupil in our sec- 
~ =vigorously and 
modern social problems. 
Constant Physical Exercise Esg¢xtial—Mere sup- 
pression of the natural inborn tendency to give expres- 
sion to physical vigor will no longer suffice in the midst 
of the hyper-activity of our social, economic and in- 
dustrial worlds. It is essential to ingrain the idea, 
and establish the habit, of recreation and play in the 
pupil’s experience in some wholesome way, not in in- 
termittent spurts, but regularly, each day from year 
to year. The ability to live at approximately 100 
percent of vital, physical efficiency each day is an in- 
valuable asset to any individual. One hundred per- 
cent physical vitality is one of the factors contributing 
to real efficiency in any phase of work, manual, indus- 
trial, commercial, economic, social, scholastic, moral 
or religious. There is no necessity for long cessa-
-P-A-G-E-468
  446 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tions of several weeks or months from one’s daily 
routine of work when the habit of daily exercise, sim- 
ple though it may be, is combined with a certain 
amount of recreation and free play. To speak in the 
language of the golfer for a moment, many of the 
mental hazards and bunkers can be crossed over with 
comparatively little anxiety when one keeps himself in 
practice. In any phase of activity involving skill, 
spasmodic effor(@alone, with lapses in between, will 
be futile and ineff€=tive. 
Different types of recreation are necessary for dif- 
ferent individuals. The person employed in sedentary 
work requires a different type of recreation from the 
person who is doing work that involves muscular 
fatigue. But both persons need the recreation just 
the same. A person may be very much fatigued from 
his daily routine of work or employment, and yet may 
need exercise to recreate those parts of the body and 
mind that have not been exercised in any way. It is 
possible to adapt recreational work involved in health 
activities to individual needs and interests just as 
subject matter is adapted to individual mental differ- 
ences of pupils. This applies to adults as well as to 
adolescent pupils. 
The organization and direction of physical educa- 
tion, at its best, under the guidance of fundamental 
principles, must be carried on within the secondary 
school system. In formal school work during all the 
years, it is impossible to overestimate the importance 
of habituating one’s self to some kind of healthful 
physical activity or recreation. This applies to teach- 
ers as well as to students and implies that provision
-P-A-G-E-469
  HEALTH AND OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 447 
should be made for exercise in health activity for in- 
structors wherever at all possible. 
Size of the Teaching Staff—LHvery secondary school 
having an enrollment of approximately 1,000 pupils 
should have a well-organized department of physical 
education. The staff employed should be well-trained. 
The number required will vary under differing con- 
ditions. But it is possible to employ five or six per- 
sons under the above circumstances. ; One duty of the 
physical director should be to organize the complete 
work of the department as a whole. There should be 
also a supervisor whose duty it would be to correlate 
the work done in athletics with that done in gym- 
nastics and in physiology and hygiene. Full-time and 
part-time coaches should assist. A school nurse 
should be part of the staff. She should serve both as 
an assistant to the director of physical education in 
specialized work and as a social welfare servant of the 
community. Nothing can do more to unite the home 
and the school than the work of a school nurse when 
her personality is agreeable, and when the work out- 
lined is really of service to the community. Directors 
or heads of physical education departments, athletic 
coaches, gymnasium instructors and all the other 
officers connected with the department of physical 
education have an unlimited and enviable opportunity 
to direct both the physical and social life of the com- 
munity in its recreational aspects as a whole. 
Every School Should Have Some Form of Physical 
Education in Its Plan of Instruction.—The size of the 
staff will vary, but no school should exist without some 
instructors giving attention to this work. The con-
-P-A-G-E-470
  448 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
viction cannot be too often reiterated that physical 
education is not a matter of now and then directing 
physical activity, and so hoping to preserve physical 
efficiency. Biologically and psychologically, the hu- 
man organism is so constituted that it is incessantly 
active. The young child spontaneously exercises all 
the muscles of its body and grows strong. The pre- 
adolescent is a bundle of nerves and muscles still 
continuing to seek expression. If not curbed, this 
energy can be directed and exercised in the form of 
organized free play, games and sports. This same 
tendency toward physical expression of one kind or 
another continues during the whole of the adolescent 
period and beyond. Guidance and direction of this 
tendency of the human organism to be always active 
is essential in order that suppression, stultification or 
distortion may not occur. Organized physical edu- 
cation is more than a mere duty. It is a real privilege 
to have an opportunity through the department of 
organized health activities to control a natural tend- 
ency universally expressed by all human beings. 
The Psychology of Games.—The psychology of a 
large number of games ought to be understood so far 
as possible by all instructors in the departments of 
physical education, and as well, by just as many other 
high school instructors as possible. Such knowledge 
has to do with the psychology of play and with the 
pupils’ attitudes toward and interests in physical 
activities of all kinds during the different years of 
their school life. With respect to the analysis of the 
learning process in games, a good deal more could be 
done than has been done up to the present time. Many  
-P-A-G-E-471
  HEALTH AND OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 449 
of the skills and activities involved could be analyzed 
objectively into the various steps and fundamentals 
involved in learning to throw, swim, jump, dance, run 
and soforth. The analysis of the whole of any process 
into its fundamentals on the part of the instructor is 
all-important. This ability is a partial guarantee of 
the instructor’s success. 
Physical Education in Terms of the Objectives of 
the North Central Association of Colleges and Second- 
ary Schools.—Since it is recognized that. physical 
education applies to all of the pupils in attendance 
in the junior-senior or six-year reorganized secondary 
school, the content of the subject matter outlined, in 
terms of educational objectives, should be stated with 
clearness and definiteness, equal to that of the like 
statement in any of the other departments of high 
school instruction. There is a growing conviction 
that high school athletics should not be confined to the 
limited and chosen few. It is also agreed that athletics 
should in no way be professionalized in a remunerative 
way in the high schools. Furthermore, it is believed 
that physical education, founded upon a fundamental 
educational basis, should be sponsored by secondary 
schools, and competently supervised by the very best 
trained directors of physical education available. 
Consequently, directors, coaches and teachers in de- 
partments of physical education should appreciate, as 
well as teachers of academic subjects, the major ob- 
jectives in secondary education. All persons engaged 
in the work of physical education departments should 
codperate with the instructors in all other departments 
cof the secondary school in the formation and presenta-
-P-A-G-E-472
  450 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tion of subject matter in conformity with the large, 
general objectives of education. 
Obviously, the various theoretical and practical 
aspects involved in physical education contribute di- 
rectly, and in a very definite way, to the health ob- 
jective. This aspect of education as a whole is very 
deserving of both immediate and extensive attention. 
In a somewhat more indirect way, the subject matter 
taught in the department of physical education contrib- 
utes also to the realization of other educational ob- 
jectives such as leisure-time, social and vocational. 
The first three objectives are especially important in 
the junior high school, but are also of importance in 
the senior high school. A beginning should be made 
in the realization of the vocational objective on the 
level of routine skills in the senior high school. The 
larger fulfilment of this vocational objective should 
continue to take place on a higher intellectual level, 
either within some type of higher institution of learn- 
ing, or within some later occupational career of the 
student. 
One of the chief administrative difficulties to be taken 
into account in outlining subject matter in harmony 
with a group of common objectives for the whole of 
the secondary school, to be realized in some degree in 
the experience of all pupils, is the inevitable dupli- 
cation and over-lapping both of the content, and of the 
presentation, of certain subject matter. The content 
outlined in some instances under one or more of the 
objectives will appear to be identical with that sug- 
gested under other objectives. The approach, how- 
ever, is different in the several instances, though it
-P-A-G-E-473
  
HEALTH AND OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 451 
may appear to be a mere mechanical repetition of 
materials similar to the traditional treadmill once 
often met with in the seventh and eighth grades of the 
elementary school. Duplication of certain materials 
in physical education courses proper, and in certain 
phases of introductory natural science, introductory 
social science, physiology and hygiene, for example, 
is evident in discussing such a topic as health, both 
personal and public. This difficulty of the mere over- 
lapping of subject matter may be largely reduced 
through the use of real administrative correlation. 
When all the teachers are cognizant of the outstanding 
common major objectives toward which each one is 
working and contributing, it is possible to avoid un- 
necessary waste and duplication of effort on the part 
both of pupils and of the teaching force. 
There should be a total minimum requirement of one 
unit (one year’s work) of practical hygiene and two 
units (two years’ work) of directed physical activities 
in the period covered by the junior-senior high school. 
These activities should be selected with particular ref- 
erence to health, and should be distributed profitably 
throughout the whole six years of secondary education 
rather than concentrated into too limited a part of the 
pupil’s school life. The exact number of class periods 
per week is a matter of administrative detail. 
Previous to the presentation of the brief outline of 
illustrative subject matter given below, two items 
should be mentioned. In the first place, the materials 
outlined are merely suggestive and representive. No 
attempt is made to outline in any iron-clad way the 
order of sequential arrangement of this content.
-P-A-G-E-474
452 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Great leeway should be allowed in this respect to meet 
the exigencies of various situations involved in differ- 
ing conditions in various school systems, large and 
small. In the second place, the content of the subject 
matter has been submitted to a limited number of 
physical directors in colleges and in secondary schools 
for approval and revision. A part of the plan rep- 
resents theory, and part of it practice already 
actualized. 
To be conerete and specific, a certain secondary 
school having an enrollment of over 1,000 pupils is at 
the present time practicing many of the items involved 
in this discussion, besides doing other desirable things 
not explicitly mentioned by the Committee on Unit 
Curricula. The point is, this secondary school is 
carrying out very well the spirit of the work suggested. 
For example, two outstanding purposes of this school 
are published as follows: 1. To keep pupils physi- 
cally fit during their entire school experience; 2. To 
develop desires and habits that will tend to ‘‘carry on’’ 
into life interests and practices after the pupils leave 
the high school. This school has a special teaching 
staff of four men and four women, for boys and girls 
respectively, which has the codperation of school phy- 
sicians, nurses and teachers of academic subjects. 
Physical examinations, medical inspection, corrective 
gymnastics, filtering and purifying of water in the 
swimming tank, try-out or optional courses for high 
school entrants and provision for both optional and 
required courses throughout the school life of pupils 
are some of the items which are in vogue in this school, 
 
-P-A-G-E-475
  HEALTH AND OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 453 
and which are in harmony with the plan of the present 
discussion. 
Suggestions such as these merely mark the beginning 
of a correct approach. to, and procedure in, the whole 
problem of reorganized physical education. The ma- 
terials as here presented should be tried out by numer- 
ous secondary schools, and omissions and revisions 
made. Above all, the material as outlined should not 
be used in a stilted and stereotyped manner. The 
spirit and method of approach is the chief concern. 
The following material represents the method of proce- 
dure as applied to the health objective. A similar 
pattern method has been used with reference to the 
social, leisure time, and vocational objectives.

Without attempting to continue the detailed outline 
of materials under the social and leisure-time ob- 
jectives a résumé of suggested topics is here given, 
in terms of knowledge, attitudes and habits or skill. 
Physical education in relation to community centers 
of various kinds; codperation with parent-teacher 
associations and other organizations, such as Rotary 
Clubs and so forth; lectures in social centers, school 
auditoriums, and so forth, and problems of health and

disease; use of moving pictures concerning housing 
conditions; participation in organized activities in 
different communities such as play-grounds, recreation 
centers, tennis courts, skating ponds, golf-links, base- 
ball diamonds, public gymnasium facilities; training 
in the ability to judge good form in the playing of 
games; training in the ability to appreciate esthetic 
aspects of dramatization, folk and interpretative danc- 
ing, pantomiming and so forth. 
As is true in all newly organized work, many errors 
will be made in the effort to place health activities on 
a par with the study of the regular high school sub- 
jects. Nevertheless no large high school should be 
regarded as well-organized which does not take into 
account the duty of organizing its work so as to fulfill 
the health objective. On the other hand, no high 
school is so small in its enrollment that it can justify 
itself in ignoring wholly the attempt to realize in as 
large a measure as possible this same objective. 
Naturally the spirit of conservatism often existing in 
the smaller schools will bring about some objections 
to this newer procedure. There is only one effective 
answer: ‘To demonstrate the value and effectiveness 
of education in health activities through continued 
effort on the part of instructors. 
B. Organized and Directed High School Activities 
Relative Importance of Collateral Activities in Sec- 
ondary Schools.—For many years allied or so-called 
extra-curricular activities were regarded as outside 
the pale of school precincts. They were regarded as 
useless or ‘‘plus’’ affairs having little to do with the 
 
-P-A-G-E-479
  HEALTH AND OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 457 
high school. This attitude has now been modified 
greatly. Such activities have come to be regarded as 
an integral part of the junior-senior high school sys- 
tem. These activities, it is now believed, have a great 
deal to do with the qualities that are operative and 
- consequential during post-secondary school life. This 
does not imply that the experience and training ac- 
quired through the successful pursuit of secondary 
school studies are inconsequential in after life. It 
does imply that many of the experiences acquired 
through the well-organized and directed high school 
activities may carry over into after life with great 
profit to the pupil. In any community in which pupils 
may chance to reside after completing their formal 
high school training, a great many worthy non- 
academic organizations exist. There are also many 
varied activities to be found. These activities will be 
successful to the degree in which they have intelligent 
leadership. The training and experience which pupils 
have received in similar activities when in attendance 
in high school may result in the transfer of improved 
efficiency in everyday life. 
General Meaning or Nature of High School Activi- 
ties.—‘‘ Activities,’’ as here used, refers to all of those 
aspects of high school experience not provided for in 
the regular academic and vocational program of 
studies. Activities may assume a great variety of 
forms. The general assembly period, directed student 
government organizations, many varieties of school 
clubs correlated with the work being done in high 
school subjects, formal and informal social recreation 
affairs among high school pupils and athletics are
-P-A-G-E-480
   SECONDARY EDUCATION 
representative examples of some of the more prom- 
inent school activities now in vogue. 
In large city school systems, numerous types of 
school clubs may be found. In some instances, over 
fifty forms exist within a single school system. In 
such cities as Rochester, New York, Detroit and Los 
Angeles, and in numerous other cities, many concrete 
examples of the different types of organized school 
activities may be found. In the smaller school sys- 
tems, it will be feasible to establish only a limited num- 
ber. Sometimes prejudice will be shown against the 
organization of any activities outside of high school 
subjects as such. Here, as in other aspects of school 
life, the chief convincing argument in favor of this 
newer phase of work can best be made in terms of 
successful management. 
Relation of High School Activities to Educational 
Objectives—Arguments in defense of the organiza- 
tion of high school activities can be produced effect- 
ively in terms of educational objectives of secondary 
education. Especially is this true with reference to 
social and leisure-time objectives. 
Keeping in mind the pattern method of procedure 
outlined in previous discussions relative to high school 
subjects, it is quite practicable to utilize this method 
in the field of allied school activities. A mimeo- 
graphed copy of a statement of the organization of 
an allied activities program for the junior high schools 
of Colorado Springs is suggestive of a profitable pro- 
cedure. Certain phases of the plan used in this sys- 
tem are representative of the work being done through- 
out the country as a whole. 
        
 
-P-A-G-E-481
  HEALTH AND OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 459 
The published statement begins with a résumé of 
guiding principles as follows: Allied activities have 
a place of supreme importance in the junior high school 
program; such activities should be developed in a 
gradual way; each pupil should be connected with some 
one of the activities; efforts should be made to avoid 
mere mechanical imitation of senior high school activi- 
ties; intra-school competition should be increased so 
far as possible, and inter-school competition reduced, 
in athletics, largely because of the immaturity of 
pupils. 
An enumeration of the activities in vogue in the 
school system follows: Home rooms, clubs, guidance 
and advisory periods, auditorium meetings, student 
participation in school government, honor societies, 
class organizations, athletic associations, school publi- 
cations, special day celebrations, school projects and 
other supplementary organizations. Such lists as 
this represent a miscellaneous array of interests. But 
since it has been assumed that many of these activities 
are somewhat similar within school life, and after- 
wards, there is all the more reason for training in, and 
directing of, such activities organized within the 
school. 
Number and Distribution of Activities Obviously 
the number of activities put into operation by the 
school as a whole will depend upon the size of the sys- 
tem. In cosmopolitan high schools there is practically 
no limit, since all of the interests represented by stu- 
dent groups should be recognized. 
Administratively considered, the distribution of 
activities is important. In large schools, it is possible
-P-A-G-E-482
| 
460 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to provide enough collateral activities so that each 
pupil may have an opportunity to do something more 
or less outstanding in one or more lines. In smaller 
schools, combined organizations may sometimes be 
used in order to include a somewhat wider range of 
interests than is possible otherwise. Precaution needs 
to be used lest some pupils spread out their interests 
among too many organizations. At the other extreme 
are those pupils who are inclined to engage in practi- 
eally no activities outside of the pursuit of the regular 
school studies. 
Bridging the Gap between School and Life.—Some 
years ago, many published articles appeared concern- 
ing the chasm that usually exists between formal 
school work and life as it must later on be lived. Many 
aspects now introduced into the regular school studies 
pursued have tended to reduce this gap. Even so, 
there is no place in the public high school system where 
a greater opportunity exists for cementing together 
the common interests of the community than the or- 
ganized collateral activities of the high school. The 
need for, and the desirability of, participation by each 
pupil in some one or more of these activities is an 
assumption granted by everyone. Similarities appear 
between this procedure and what it is hoped will be 
realized in socialized recitations. Codperation of the 
kind that must obtain in a successful democracy finds 
an excellent opportunity for expression in many ways 
in the administration of these school activities. It is 
an illustration of the fact that, after all, so-called 
formal and informal education are not absolutely 
demarcated, and are not opposed to one another, but 
    
-P-A-G-E-483
Se ee ee ee en 
HEALTH AND OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 461 
are complementary aspects of the rounded experience 
of individuals, representing many-sided interests, 
academic and non-academic, but nevertheless valuable 
as well as pleasurable. 
There is no finer opportunity for the actualization 
and realization of what has been thought of as the 
sociological principle of interdependence than in par- 
ticipation in school affairs of the fore-going types. 
Such participation serves as an illustration of social- 
ized individuals in action, who have learned how to 
work, play and live together well, and as unselfishly as 
possible in human affairs. It is doubtful whether any 
phase of school life is more moralizing in its influence 
than actual successful participation in representative 
and well-directed secondary school activities.

    CHAPTER XXV 
THE RELATIVE VALUE OF PUPIL-GUIDANCE 
IN THE JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
Introduction.—Large parts of the educational ca- 
reers of the majority of pupils while in high school are 
merely hit or ee affairs. One of the chief reasons 
for this condition is that no satisfactory wrought-out 
technique of procedure in guidance has existed in the 
past within the majority of school systems. More 
attention must be given to the guidance of pupils in 
the selection of subjects pursued. Also with refer- 
ence to life careers, one commonly hears the remark 
made by high school graduates that they do not have 
the least idea as to what they will pursue after the time 
of their ‘‘graduation day’’. Furthermore, it is no 
unusual thing to hear college students say that they 
do not know precisely what they will do upon having 
graduated from a higher institution of learning. This 
will be found, iis investigation, to be true of a large 
percentage of students -who rank as college seniors. 
Many persons believe that high school pupils are 
much too immature to make so much as a tentative 
life-career choice. This must at once be granted pro- 
viding such choices are presumed to be made without 
considerable careful advice given by experienced and 
mature-minded persons. Furthermore, a_ certain 
number of individuals contend that even college stu- 
464  
-P-A-G-E-487
  VALUE OF PUPIL-GUIDANCE 465 
dents should not choose life careers until they have 
reached at least the senior year. The validity of this 
assertion will depend again upon many factors. It 
will depend very much upon the type of occupation 
or profession which the student expects to follow. 
Apart from this consideration, there is no doubt that 
the earlier a choice can be rationally made by a stu- 
dent, the more motivated his work will be. There is 
no gross crime committed, even though the individual 
should change his mind once or more during his 
secondary schooling or college training. Under the 
usual régime, where practically no guidance exists, his 
mind is usually changed many times. 
The Value of the Diagnostic Tendency in Educa- 
tion.—Diagnosis in the field of medicine indubitably 
is of large value. Training in the ability to make 
diagnoses is very different now from what it was even 
a few generations ago when the apprenticeship system 
was largely in vogue. Under this system, a young 
man spent some months with an experienced physician 
in his office and was then regarded as fit for actual 
practice, in another hurriedly established office. Not 
so in these days of microscopic analysis of diseases. 
Perhaps no single profession so well represents the 
virtues of the diagnostic procedure as that of medicine. 
Analogously speaking, a good deal of progress has 
been made in the field of diagnostic tests in elementary 
school subjects. This is especially true in writing, 
spelling, reading and arithmetic. As compared with 
the accuracy of diagnoses possible in the field of medi- 
eine, diagnostic work in education is unsatisfactory. 
As contrasted with educational theory and practice of
-P-A-G-E-488
SRR a IRE 7ST as Ee PS LEN PE EEC NM Oe Se AEN RED Se eT Oe ok 
466 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
several generations ago, however, much progress can 
be claimed, due to diagnostic tests and measurements 
in school subjects. Again, recent attempts have been 
made, meager as they may seem yet to be, to make job- 
analyses in the field of industry. Some progress, in 
contrast to the earlier apprenticeship practice, has 
been made through our recent efforts to fit men more 
definitely for appropriate jobs. All of this is to say 
that out of this diagnostic method of procedure there 
eventually will develop something of large value, di- 
rectly and indirectly, in the field of pupil-guidance in 
secondary schools. 
Establishment of Personnel Departments.—Person- 
nel work was conducted with a certain degree of 
success in the Army during the World War. It is now 
customary to use some form of personnel work in the 
fields of industry and commerce. In a limited number 
of colleges this personnel work has been begun with 
some success. In a still more limited number of the 
larger secondary schools, it has been established. 
Sometimes it is connected with what is known as the 
department of reference and research. The custom- 
ary preliminary work done by the Y. M. C. A. and 
Y. W. C. A. and similar organizations in colleges and 
secondary schools for some years past has represented 
a noteworthy effort in harmony with what is now 
characterized as guidance. For many years educators 
have assented to the statement that education is pri- 
marily for the sake of the pupil. This phase or tenet 
is becoming much more freighted with meaning as our 
ways and means for realizing it gradually and slowly 
develop.
-P-A-G-E-489
  VALUE OF PUPIL-GUIDANCE 467 
Educational and Vocational Guidance Distin- 
guished.—For convenience of discussion one may 
think of two phases or aspects of guidance, educational 
and vocational. At certain points these over-lap. At 
other points they involve somewhat different elements. 
Educational guidance may be used to signify those 
ways and means that have to do with a pupil’s pro- 
cedure in the choice and pursuit of school subjects as 
such, and with all his academic formal school expe- 
rience. Vocational guidance may be used to designate 
those aspects connected directly, but sometimes in- 
directly, with the pupil’s tentative or permanent 
choice of a life career, occupation or profession, while 
in attendance in the junior-senior high school, in the 
junior college, or thereafter. 
The Intermittent and Ephemeral Choices of Occupa- 
tions by Children and Adolescents.—How many whim- 
sical or fanciful choices of occupations children make 
even before entering elementary schools, as well as 
during their attendance in elementary schools nobody 
can estimate accurately. But these random evanescent 
choices certainly would constitute a very large total 
sum. What the child sees going on about it in its en- 
vironment is the largest single determining factor in 
this almost unending series of tentative choices. The 
presence in the home of an affable maid, nurse, seam- 
stress or music teacher, may lead the average pre- 
adolescent girl to change her choice of what she would 
like to become as often as the above-named individuals 
may intermittently appear in her presence. The re- 
spective presences of a successful baseball pitcher, a 
football captain, a carpenter, a piano-tuner, a painter,  
-P-A-G-E-490
  468 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
a Boy Scout leader, and an engineer, may likewise 
change chameleon-like the adolescent boy’s choice very 
frequently within a short span of years. 
It is profitable for persons in charge of secondary 
schools, or for any persons employed on the teaching 
staff, to make an inventory of the interests, tastes and 
choices of pupils relative to values of high school edu- 
cation, and of what pupils intend to do in their suc- 
cessive years of high school work. Ina representative

Reliable Place of Educational Guidance.—It is not 
possible nor desirable to separate educational from 
vocational guidance in any arbitrary fashion, but for 
administrative purposes they need differentiation. 
Educational guidance involves a number of aspects 
such as what subjects to pursue, how best to learn to 
study with greatest profit and how to divide one’s 
time between curricular and extra-curricular activities. 
Not every teacher or school officer is capable of giving 
the wisest direction in these matters. Many parents, 
because of either lack of training or lack of time, or
-P-A-G-E-495
VALUE OF PUPIL-GUIDANCE 473 
occasionally of both, are likely to render rather little 
assistance on this point. Therefore, it seems that 
superintendents, principals and teachers, should give 
this assistance, if possible. Some teachers are better 
prepared than others to do this sort of educational ad- 
visory work. They need to be unprejudiced, fair- 
minded and broad-visioned, in order to do this task 
well, so that the pupil will really profit from such 
guidance. 
When this advisory work is delegated to a committee 
having an aggressive and ingenious chairman, much 
assistance can be rendered to ‘‘groping’’ pupils. Cer- 
tain hours for conference need to be planned for, of 
course. But these conferences need to be supplemented 
with more detailed advice along with the daily class- 
room work. Ideally, the whole teaching corps should 
be resolved into an educational guidance board which 
can give pupils rational grounds and justifications for 
pursuing certain subjects rather than other subjects. 
No successful educational guidance program can be 
carried out unless the whole teaching body codperates 
in the most intelligent and broad-minded way. Other- 
wise the plan-depends upon the prejudiced viewpoint 
of an expert guidance director, or else becomes a com- 
posite of a group of personal whims, any one of which 
is as good as another. 
Indirectly and almost unconsciously, a great deal of 
educational direction as to the pursuit of proper 
studies has been given by the best teachers of the past. 
But since the number of subjects has increased con- 
siderably, it is important, even on this count alone, 
that pupils be wisely guided, not only in entering the
-P-A-G-E-496

474 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
junior or senior high school, but in entering the junior 
college. They should have continual counsel as they 
progress because of the possible changes of interest, 
and because of the possible discovery of a bent or 
aptitude for certain theoretical or practical phases 
represented in school -subjects. Secondary school 
pupils need educational comradeship about as much as 
they need anything. To be able to assist a pupil in 
making the choices of his courses of study and curric- 
ula is to be able to render a pupil a service that will 
always be of value to him. And this task will still be 
incomplete even when every effort possible is put forth 
to do one’s best as an educational adviser or director. 
Relative Place of Vocational Guidance.—In prac- 
tice, vocational guidance cannot be carried on wholly 
apart from educational guidance of the pupil. How 
many years of a foreign language, ancient or modern, 
a pupil is justified in studying will depend somewhat 
on what he is most likely to do later on. The study 
of Latin, for example, will evidently be of more value 
to a person who intends to be a teacher of languages, 
to a research linguist, to a journalist or to a minister, 
than to a person intending to become an electrical en- 
gineer, an architect, a business expert or an efficiency 
man in industry. If all pupils continued to do formal 
“schoolwork until at least the end of the senior high 
school or junior college, it would be less difficult to 
advise relative to a pupil’s life career or vocation. 
As it now is, unless a certain percentage of pupils re- 
ceive both educational and vocational guidance all 
along the way from the beginning of junior-senior high 
school on to the end of the junior-senior college, they
-P-A-G-E-497

will never receive any worthwhile advice at all. And 
it should be kept in mind that it is just those per- 
sons who do not complete the respective cycles or 
units of education who need this advice most. 
School Subjects Pursued Furnish Some Guidance.— 
Traditional practice has made it possible for all pupils 
in school to pursue a limited number of academic sub- 
jects. And so, in a sense, school subjects have for 
them become ‘‘trial’’ or ‘‘try-out’’ guidance courses. 
This has furnished, therefore, one type of opportunity 
for educational guidance, and so has served to some 
extent as a selective process. On the other hand, with 
few exceptions, very little opportunity has been given 
to pupils to study life vocations and occupations hav- 
ing to do with the so-called practical activities. It 
seems to be justifiable to insist that this practical side 
of experience should be analyzed by pupils, especially 
those who, indubitably, will eventually select a life 
career in such fields. So it is customary in some 
junior and senior high schools to devote a certain per- 
centage of time to a survey and study of occupations, 
in the earlier school career of the pupil, for the pur- 
pose of creating tentative attitudes and intelligent 
formative appreciations, and in the later school career 
to serve as the basis for a more permanent choice of a 
life-time occupational career. — ? 
Necessary Precaution—Vocational guidance should 
be carried on with great precaution lest there be a 
temptation to lead certain pupils at too early an age to 
choose permanently their life careers. On the other 
hand, the ‘‘life-career motive,’’ when introduced early 
and used intelligently, can be made to do a great deal
-P-A-G-E-498
  476 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
for the so-called blasé-minded pupil, in the ennui- 
spirited school system. The purpose of much of this 
discussion has been to point out the fact that educa- 
tional and vocational guidance should go along hand 
in hand with all of the rest of the legitimate work of 
the secondary school. The secondary school has not 
fulfilled its mission when it has taught merely so many 
facts and labeled or catalogued a certain amount ‘of 
information. Our guidance program is far from 
perfect at the present time, but it has perhaps justified 
itself in a large measure up to date. One of the theses 
of this volume is that the secondary school and the 
subject matter taught in it should represent all of the 
present-day, and all of the possible future, experiences 
of individuals in a continually and rapidly changing 
environment. 
Guidance as a Form of Noteworthy Social Service — 
Educational and vocational guidance are two forms of 
the expression of the highest and most commendable 
sort of social service which can be rendered. We may 
call this work ‘<personnel work,’’ as it has been named 
in the Army, and as it is being called in certain indus- 
trial or business concerns, and in a limited number of 
colleges. Name it what we will, it represents one 
phase of educational administration which is bound to 
bear fruit if wisely, accurately and continually carried 
on. The exact manner in which this work is to be 
carried out must vary in different situations. Some- 
times it may be done successfully through well and 
unprejudicedly trained experts; sometimes, through 
deputized, wisely selected, competent teacher-groups 
and subcommittees; sometimes, through superintend-
-P-A-G-E-499
  VALUE OF PUPIL-GUIDANCE 477 
ents and principals who have the ability and knack of 
wisely delegating power in any manner whereby the 
real inclinations, interests and abilities of pupils are 
conserved, and whereby new attitudes, interests and 
ideals are developed both through academic and vo- 
cational and occupational experiences. 
The necessity for educational guidance is obvious 
in the light of the fact that new school subjects and 
subject matter have been introduced into the curricula 
of secondary schools. The necessity for vocational 
guidance, too, is evident from the tremendous increase 
in the number of occupations during the last genera- 
tion. Specialization in industry and commerce makes 
it difficult for immature individuals to choose wisely 
and intelligently their life occupations. Careful guid- 
ance on the part of mature individuals is essential. 
QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION 
1. What evidence is there that students as a rule have not chosen 
their life occupations upon graduation either from high school or 
from college? 
2. What is the advantage in having students make tentative 
choices of occupational careers while attending high school or 
college? 
3. Show that the diagnostic tendency has gradually become 
more prevalent in different fields. 
4, What is the nature and advantage of personnel departments 
established in different types of institutions? 
5. Distinguish educational and vocational guidance by giving 
one concrete example of each. 
6. Indicate by illustrations the tendency of younger children to 
choose tentatively what they think they want to do later on in life, 
occupationally or professionally. 
7. Give examples of the attitudes expressed by high school pupils 
 
-P-A-G-E-500
  478 SECONDARY EDUCATION { 
toward the necessity of an education, and toward the varieties of 
occupations chosen tentatively. 
8. Discuss the relative importance of educational and vocational 
guidance in secondary schools. 
9. In what respect does guidance represent the type of social 
service rendered to secondary school pupils? 
10. Show the increasing necessity of vocational guidance in the 
light of the multiplicity of occupations that now exist.

FURTHER ADMINISTRATIVE SOCIAL PROB- 
LEMS OF REORGANIZED SECONDARY 
EDUCATION 
Résumé of the General Problems Discussed in This 
Text.—A wide range of general and specific problems 
of secondary education has been reviewed in the 
previous chapters of this text. The following general 
topics, set forth in the preliminary statement of the 
text, have actually been given some treatment and con- 
sideration: The importance of a knowledge of guiding 
principles of secondary education; the need of continual 
readjustment of education to meet new conditions; the 
professional preparation of high school instructors; 
the guidance of the learning process of pupils; im- 
proved general method and special methods of 
teaching of separate high school subjects; the adminis- 
trative use of mental tests and measurements; the 
historical development of secondary education in Hu- 
rope and America during the nineteenth century; the 
reorganization of secondary education during the 
twentieth century with reference to enlarged objectives 
and curriculum building; the administration of the 
content of subject matter under the separate high 
school subjects; the organization and administration 
of a department of physical education and of other 
allied activities; and pupil-guidance.

FURTHER SOCIAL PROBLEMS 481 
Most, if not all, of the above problems will continue 
to be major issues in secondary education during the 
next quarter of a century or more. Other adminis- 
trative problems have been suggested by implication, 
but have not been discussed. In this final chapter, 
it is only possible to name a limited number of addi- 
tional problems worthy of consideration in progressive 
junior-senior high schools. The following are repre- 
sentative: Codperation of the high school with outside 4 
community organizations, or the high school as a co- 
ordinating agency and center; the duties of the high 
school principal; the construction of buildings adapted 
to the realization of high school purposes; improved 
standards and methods of selecting high school text- 
books; and codperation between the high school libra- 
rian and other librarians of the community. 
Social-Mindedness an Important Attitude.—The 
principle of social-mindedness is an important factor 
in developing a wholesome attitude toward the school 
as a coordinating center. Social-mindedness implies 
the ability of individuals to think, feel and act under 
the impulsion of genuine community interests. It im- 
plies the ability of adolescent pupils in some measure, 
and of adults in an increasing measure, to live together 
well. It involves the manifestation of all of the in- 
terests of all individuals in the community. The 
universal tie that binds communities, whether widely 
separated or in close proximity, is the common bond 
of interest. Physical boundary lines are secondary as 
compared with the primary bond of common interests. 
Social-mindedness represents an expansion or exten- 
sion of the integrating function of the secondary  
-P-A-G-E-504
  | 
482 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
school as such. To develop an intelligent like- 
mindedness among adolescent pupils, and among adult 
peoples, may be regarded as one of the primary func- 
tions of secondary education. 
The High School as a Coérdinating Agency.—The 
school system as a whole, in any community, should 
serve as an outstanding codrdinating agency. The 
assumption is justifiable that the unit of education 
known as the secondary school is dominantly a social- 
izing institution. The secondary school should, there- 
fore, not only agopernie with the elementary school 
and with higher institutions of learning, but with all of 
the effectively organized institutions of the com- 
munity. And furthermore, in so far as other com- 
munity interests are not well-organized, the high 
school should seek to supplement the work of these 
other agencies. _ 
Sometimes this may involve a division of labor or 
responsibilities. In case some community organiza- 
tion is already meeting definitely a certain need, it 
may be wise for the school not to attempt to duplicate 
this activity, but rather to codperate. Parent-teacher 
associations seem to have functioned more largely 
relative to the elementary school than to the high 
school. It is justifiable to assume that this institution 
should also function beyond the sixth grade, and be- 
yond the eighth grade. Codperation with the Rotary, 
Kiwanis, Lions and commercial clubs has proved to 
be very helpful in connection with building programs 
and other educational campaigns. Codperation with 
the Y. M. C. A., the Y. W. C. A., the Boy Scouts, the 
f .

FURTHER SOCIAL PROBLEMS 483 
Campfire Girls, and other moralizing agencies is 
desirable. 
The Duties of a High School Principal—tThe fre- 
quent factotum-like nature of a principal’s work in 
the high school is well known. In the small. high 
school he is expected to do, and to teach, whatever is / 
left over and has not been allotted to the respective 
instructors. In large systems, as well as in smaller 
ones usually, most of his time is consumed in perform- 
ing clerical duties that could well be done by persons 
not so highly paid. 
The solution of this difficulty is not easy in the case 
either of large or of small schools. In any event, the 
high school principal should be given the opportunity 
to become one of the most prominent social leaders of 
the community as well as the real director of policies 
within the high school. The opportunity to perform 
such a social service is to be found in making the high 
school a clearing house and coérdinating center. But 
the one place in which the greatest loss has been found 
relative to the direction of high school policies and 
practices is the supervisory duties of classroom in- 
structors. Only a general suggestion can here be 
made. In the smaller school systems, the principal 
ean find it feasible to do. some supervisory work by 
teaching fewer hours per day. That is to say, in order 
to provide some time for supervisory work, it is justi- 
fiable to reduce or sacrifice the actual number of hours 
spent in a miscellaneous way in order to do at least a 
minimum of supervisory work. The limited number 
of personal observations of classroom teaching made  
-P-A-G-E-506
  484 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
should be supplemented by typewritten or mimeo- 
graphed statements. In the larger school systems the 
problem is different. Here it is more largely a matter 
of redistribution of time between the routine and 
clerical duties of the office and supervised classroom 
instruction. In such systems it is possible for the 
principal to delegate supervisory power to his best 
trained and qualified instructors. 
Two things are essential in order to develop super- 
vision of secondary education. High school principals 
should be professionally trained for supervision, and 
a definite technique of supervised instruction should 
be organized. Some of the same principles will apply 
whether the high school principal acts as supervisor 
or separate supervisors are used for separate school 
subjects. In the case of the inexperienced principal 
or special supervisor, training in general method and 
special methods of teaching, in tests and measurements 
and in curriculum making are minimum essentials. 
In either case, some experience should have been had 
as a teacher of one or more school subjects, or as 
principal or general supervisor. No person can su- 
pervise efficiently without having had teaching ex- 
perience. ' 
The duties of the principal as a supervisor are diffi- 
cult to outline because of the difficulty of making a 
generally acceptable distribution of time. However, 
the technique of supervised instruction should include 
at least the following aspects: 1. Actual observation 
of classroom procedure through frequent visitations. 
2. Written analysis of virtues and limitations of 
classroom practices for record in the principal’s office.
-P-A-G-E-507
  FURTHER SOCIAL PROBLEMS 485 
8. Remedial suggestions through constructive, indi- 
vidual conferences with teachers, supplemented 
through teachers’ group meetings, in large schools by 
departments, in small schools including the whole 
teaching staff. 4. Selection of suitable subject matter 
based upon textbooks and reference books used, and 
upon supplementary materials not included in printed 
form. 
Standards and Methods for Selecting Textbooks.— 
The improvement of the standards and methods for 
selecting textbooks is one of the most complicated 
problems of administration in the secondary schools. 
Maxwell and a few other writers have discussed the 
possibility of evolving standards for the analysis of 
textbooks. In actual high school practice few, if any, 
standards for the selection of textbooks based upon 
analyses in terms of justifiable criteria can be found. 
In a few cases, a beginning has been made in the 
selection of textbooks by means of rating scales. 
More frequently, some combination of rating scales 
and other means is used. No uniformity in responsi- 
bility for textbook selection exists. We find the chief 
executive ‘officer, or the chief executive in codperation 
with the teaching staff; the board of education in co- 
operation with the chief executive and teaching staff; 
the state textbook commission; the county textbook 
commission; the state textbook commission in conjunc- 
tion with local authorities; or other combinations 
charged with this responsibility. The practice of hav- 
ing the chief executive alone, or the state textbook 
commission alone, select the texts is relatively infre- 
quent. To assign this authority to the local school 
 
-P-A-G-E-508
  486 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
| 
board in codperation with the executive and teaching 
staff is more common. Selection by the chief executive 
in coéperation with the teaching staff is the system 
used in, no doubt, above fifty percent of the total cases. 
Outside of a limited number of instances, however, all 
of these selections are made practically irrespective of 
either psychological or pedagogical standards, or even 
with little regard as to the mechanics of the text. 
Adaptation of School Buildings to Various Types of 
Instruction—Much high grade instruction has been 
secured in the past in spite of undesirable mate- 
rial equipment and buildings. The Garfield-Hopkins 
‘log’? analogy has an aspect worthy of emphasis. 
But the nature of school buildings is of large conse- 
quence as a means for assisting in the realization of 
the various purposes of different phases of high school 
instruction. It is important to know what the sec- 
ondary school is attempting to accomplish when archi- 
tects and contractors are asked to plan a modern high 
school building. Location of laboratories, as well as 
the nature and amount of equipment; arrangement of 
floor and wall space with reference to lighting, heat- 
ing and ventilation; ease of access to, and exit from, 
gymnasium rooms, auditoriums, classrooms and li- 
braries; and many other items have a great deal to 
do with the efficiency of a school system measured in 
terms of its purposes. Practically speaking, this 
means that school buildings should be built after long 
study of the educational needs of the local community, 
in such a way, also, that later units may be added, in 
case the community grows rapidly without destroying 
the plan of the buildings already in existence. The
-P-A-G-E-509
  FURTHER SOCIAL PROBLEMS 487 
architect should codperate with the educator so that a 
reasonable balance between the use and esthetic as- 
pects of the buildings may be recognized. The in- 
creased cost of improved high school buildings is a 
problem of serious consequence in most communities, 
large and small, which can be merely mentioned here. 
An aspect outside of the internal organization of 
the school naturally occurs to one in this connection. 
The form of the architecture of a school building will 
have something to do with either hindering or helping 
in the use of schools as social centers. All kinds of 
gatherings may be provided for with profit in school 
buildings, including both daytime and evening meet- 
ings and entertainments. There are organizations in 
existence almost without number which may well meet 
in buildings rightly planned, largely for the sake of 
bringing about indirect educational after effects. In 
many places where auditoriums have been wisely 
planned, they are used for parent-teacher meetings, 
neighborhood clubs, evening lectures, physical culture, 
folk dances for children, recreation dances for adults, 
art exhibits and so forth. Especially is this true in 
urban centers. 
Codperation with Libraries and Museums in the 
Community.—One junior high school located in a town 
of approximately 40,000, and in proximity to a very 
large city, is undertaking a plan of codperating with 
the outside social agencies which appeal to junior high 
school boys and girls. .This means that the principal 
and some of the teachers must have a working knowl- 
edge of the underlying principles and practices of these 
outside agencies. Assembly hours, lunch time hours 
 
-P-A-G-E-510
   | | 488 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
and recreation periods of the school proper should be 
correlated with the extra-school organizations. 
Many schools have already begun to codperate with 
the libraries of the community in a very profitable way. 
Everything is done to make it easier for pupils to read 
desirable books possessed either by the school library 
or by the public library. Sometimes well-chosen lists 
of books recommended by specialists in the library 
are published at least yearly, as a guide to the patrons 
and pupils. Frequently, arrangements are made for 
the interchange of books between public and school 
libraries. One reason why codrdination between the 
public library and the school is quite desirable is 
that through codrdination it is possible to satisfy a 
common intellectual interest in, and desire for, wider 
information on the part of the pupils. 
It would be possible to do much more than has yet 
been done in the way of museum and art collections, 
through the codperation of the public schools and the 
public library. This has been done in some sections 
already with considerable success. Many times, per- 
sons who have had the opportunity of extensive travel 
have made rare collections, and would upon intelligent 
solicitation be quite willing to loan, at least tempora- 
rily, such collections for school or library exhibits. 
Many pupils, too, can contribute in a variety of ways. 
Phonograph records can often be procured for use in 
the schools for special purposes, as can likewise pic- 
tures and collections made by pupils and the parents 
of pupils who travel either during the school year or 
during vacations. All of this is to be done primarily 
for the purpose of attempting to center the interest in 
 
-P-A-G-E-511
FURTHER SOCIAL PROBLEMS 489 
the school as an agency for coordinating all of the edu- 
cational assets of the community. This is no mean 
task when well done, and it is a worthy one. It will 
assist in breaking down the so-called barriers, if there 
be any, between life and school. In this way, it is 
possible for school officers to become proponents of 
educational and social service in very definite ways. 
QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION 
1. What problems named in the summary at the beginning of 
this chapter seem to you likely to be continued for further solution? 
2. What is meant by social-mindedness, and what is its relative 
importance in secondary education? 
3. What are the advantages and the difficulties in the way of re- 
garding the high school as a prominent codrdinating agency of the 
community ? 
4. Compare the duties now found in practice relative to the high 
school principalship, and suggest ways in which the principal may 
be enabled to devote more time to supervisory functions of class- 
room instruction. 
5. Make a study of the method used in selecting textbooks in a 
half dozen high schools or more. 
6. What standards can you suggest for evaluating high school 
textbooks? Should these vary for the different high school depart- 
ments? Explain your answer. 
7. Criticize the older procedure in the construction of high school 
buildings. What are some of the newer procedures which should be 
emphasized? 
8. Give concrete examples of the possibility of the codperation 
of the high school with library and museum facilities in the com- 
munity.

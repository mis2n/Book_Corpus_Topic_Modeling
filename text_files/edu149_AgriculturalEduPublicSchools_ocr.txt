PREFACE 
This work comprises a series of studies, carried on since the 
fall of 1909, on agricultural education in the elementary and 
secondary schools of the United States with special reference 
to the various agencies promoting it. Much care has been taken 
to make the bibliography representative of the literature of the 
different phases of the subject, and to annotate each title so 
as to give the reader a brief account of the original article or 
book. This seemed more essential than to undertake to give 
even an approximately complete summary of the literature of 
the subject, especially since such a summary would include many 
times the number of titles cited. 
The writer has attempted, as the subtitle indicates, to bring 
together the work of the various agencies promoting agricultural 
education in the public schools, and to show the contribution 
each has made or is making to its development. In this new 
and rapidly developing subject of education it is important for 
all who are interested to know the methods used and results 
obtained in different parts of the country, and to recognize the 
extent of public interest as expressed in federal, state, and 
private activities in its behalf. 
The demands for instruction in agriculture in elementary 
and secondary schools have grown so rapidly as to present a 
serious problem to teachers, both as to readjustment of their 
school work and as to their own preparation to teach the sub- 
ject. If this account of the development of agricultural educa- 
tion, such as is actually taking place in different parts of the 
country, with illustrations of types of instruction, and with 
sources of further information, may be of some service to the 
teachers of our rural schools, or to others interested in rural 
education, the writer will feel well repaid for all his efforts. 
The material for these studies has been gathered from all

available sources, much of it from personal correspondence. 
The writer wishes to express his appreciation of the cordial and 
ready response with which his numerous inquiries have been 
met. He is under particular obligation to Director Charles H. 
Judd, School of Education, the University of Chicago, for writ- 
ing the introduction, and for his many helpful suggestions during 
the progress of the work; to Mr. D. J. Crosby, United States 
Department of Agriculture, for the critical reading of several 
chapters, and for other assistance; to the United States Bureau 
of Education, to the State Departments of Education, and to 
many individuals who have furnished information not other- 
wise accessible.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
Agricultural education is the most widely and energetically 
cultivated form of industrial education in this country at the 
present time. Federal and local grants have made possible 
agricultural courses of different grades, and there is a large 
body of literature relating to scientific agriculture. This de- 
velopment of agricultural education is due, in the first place, 
to the large number of people who are dependent upon agri- 
culture for their livelihood. Any improvements which can be 
made in the methods of raising crops or live stock are of im- 
mediate importance to a large body of American citizens. In 
_the second place, the economic value of the products of agri- 
culture has made it important for the community at large to 
organize agencies which shall improve agricultural conditions 
throughout the country. Even the federal government has found 
it expedient to organize bureaus of investigation, and these 
bureaus of investigation have naturally come to be centers of 
educational activity. There have thus arisen organized centers 
for the collection and distribution of agricultural information. 
In the third place, the social movement which has been carrying 
the population in very large measure away from rural districts 
to the cities has made everyone aware of the necessity of de- 
veloping an educational system that shall make farm activities 
attractive to intelligent and well-trained people. Finally, students 
of education have come to see that the needs of children, quite 
apart from the needs of society at large, dictate a greater em- 
phasis upon outdoor experiences. The doctrine that children 
need to come into contact with Nature has been presented in 
different ways at different times. On the negative side it has 
been said that children should be taken away from books and 
from the artificial surroundings of large communities and should 
be brought into contact with things and natural laws. This, 
a 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  
2 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
we are told, can be accomplished best on the farm. Again, on 
the affirmative side, it has been said that the resourcefulness 
of the man who is engaged in the various occupations of the 
farm cultivates breadth of character and initiative in dealing 
with all the engagements of life. Whatever the terms em- 
ployed, the professional educator has come to regard the op- 
portunities which are presented in farm life as valuable means 
of training children. 
With the recognition of these numerous and strong motives 
for the development of agriculture as a part of the educational 
system, there comes a whole train of difficult problems of 
organization. Even those who recognize the importance and 
value of agricultural education are in doubt as to the best methods 
of attaining the result that they regard as ideal. One of the 
first questions that arises is the question of the level of training 
at which agricultural courses shall be introduced. Is the study 
of any phase of farming a suitable subject for elementary school 
children, and, if so, what simple elements of the subject can 
properly be taught at this early stage of school work? On 
the other hand, the problem of finding suitable agricultural 
courses for higher institutions is no less difficult. The agri- 
cultural colleges have found themselves in frequent conflict 
with the traditional colleges. The agricultural colleges have 
sometimes been criticized for conducting a lower grade of work 
than that which is conducted by other institutions of higher 
learning. In spite of these criticisms, in some quarters the 
agricultural courses have developed to such an extent that the 
conventional academic courses have almost disappeared from 
the institutions in the state. In either of these cases the difficulty 
of organizing advanced work is manifest. It has sometimes 
been suggested that the agricultural high school is a better 
means of promoting agricultural education than is the elementary 
school or the university. When an agricultural high school 
has been organized it has degenerated at times into an ordinary 
high school with one or two theoretical courses in agriculture.
-P-A-G-E-11
INTRODUCTORY NOTE 3 
In other cases the agricultural high school has differentiated 
itself so completely from the conventional high school that 
the students who graduate from these separate and distinct in- 
stitutions have been unable to go forward to higher institutions. 
All of these cases show the difficulty which is encountered in 
organizing the work in agricultural education. 
One of the cardinal difficulties in the organization of agri- 
cultural education is the lack of trained teachers. Teachers who 
have grown up in the normal schools or those who go into the 
profession from colleges and high school’ without a normal 
training, very seldom have practical experience adequate to give 
them a comprehension of farm problems. On the other hand, 
those who have practical experience find it difficult to secure the 
scientific training which is necessary to make instruction in 
farming sufficiently advanced to justify calling it a science. 
The graduates of agricultural colleges are either so much in de- 
mand for practical positions, or so poorly qualified for the special 
work of teaching, that they do not enter upon the teaching 
profession after they complete their agricultural course. The 
result of this whole situation is that there are many efforts being 
made to teach agriculture from textbooks, and these efforts are 
being criticized by practical people and educators alike as too 
abstract. In other quarters instruction lacks that systematic 
and progressive character which can come only from the study 
of the sciences upon which farming must ultimately rest. Prac- 
tical farmers are no better teachers than the abstract students 
of textbooks. The situation requires a careful correlating of 
the different agencies that have been working in the direction 
of a more scientific and at the same time more practical course 
of study in agriculture. 
Professor Davis has attacked the problem of the co-ordina- 
tion of all the agencies now at work on the problem of agri- 
cultural education. He has performed in this book a service 
which will be appreciated by all who have any large knowledge 
of the problem and of the difficulties which the movement en-  
-P-A-G-E-12
  
4 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
counters. He has made an effort to canvass the whole field 
of agricultural education and to give a detailed exposition of 
the agencies that are now at work in building up a rational course 
of agricultural education. He has presented more fully than 
anyone else the materials which define the problem and which 
make it possible for the teacher to meet the problem intelligently. 
The annotated bibliography at the end of the book, with text 
references, will do much to make the best material available 
for anyone who finds it necessary to get hold of this material 
through independent study. Mr. Davis’ statement of the work 
that is being done by various organized agencies will make it 
possible for the teacher to come in contact with all of the*forces 
that are working to build up this special type of training. The 
book serves, therefore, as a general introduction to the study of 
agricultural education. 
Professor Davis’ book is not a textbook of the ordinary 
type, in which a limited body of materials is presented in detail, 
but it is a type of textbook which is certain to become more 
common in our normal schools and in the teachers’ libraries. It 
is a textbook which discusses the problems of education by dis- 
cussing the situation into which education fits and the instruments 
that may be used in solving its problems. It is an introductory 
encyclopedia rather than a brief summary. The student in 
the normal school who is trained not merely to understand the 
content of a single textbook, but to take a bibliography in hand 
and follow its guidance into the larger body of literature, will 
have an independent mastery of the subject which cannot be 
gained by any simple perusal of a single textbook. Professor 
Davis has performed a genuine service, therefore, for normal 
schools in preparing a type of textbook which encourages the 
student to go to the original sources, and shows him how to 
get at the different types of material which he will need in 
his own practical professional life. 
The teacher who has graduated from the normal school and 
is in practical service often finds the textbooks that are offered 
   
-P-A-G-E-13
INTRODUCTORY NOTE 5 
for his instruction too elementary and too closely confined to the 
kind of material with which he has already acquainted him- 
self in earlier courses prior to his work as a teacher. Such a 
book as that which Professor Davis has here presented overcomes 
the difficulties which attach to the reading of such an elementary 
book. He has opened up for the teacher not merely the possi- 
bilities of reading his own book, but also the possibility of se- 
curing without serious difficulty an extensive body of productive 
literature to which this book serves as a stimulating introduction. 
Finally, the professional student of education will find in 
this book material which will give him a general view of one 
phase of industrial education that will be very helpful to him 
in the discussion of the whole matter of educational reform for 
practical results. If one wishes to discuss the best methods of 
organizing courses for the industrial classes he should certainly 
begin with a careful review of that which has already been 
undertaken in agriculture. There are some bibliographies of 
agricultural literature, and there are scattered discussions of the 
different organizations which deal with this problem, but nowhere 
is there a carefully selected summary of the whole movement. 
Professor Davis has in this respect performed a service which 
will be appreciated by students of education and by the later 
historian of education who wishes to secure in compact form a 
statement of what is now being undertaken.

CHAPTER I 
THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
Historically the movement for agricultural education in the 
United States dates back to 1785 when associations for the pro- 
motion of agriculture began to be formed. A few years later, 
in 1792, mainly in response to the agitation of these associations, 
colleges undertook to provide for instruction in agriculture, first 
Columbia, and then Harvard and Yale (1)." 
It was not, however, until 1862 that the real movement for 
scientific agriculture had its beginning. Congress of this year 
authorized the establishment of a department of agriculture 
(2, p. 57), and also passed the Morrill Act giving to each state 
a grant of land with which to establish a state college of agri- 
culture and mechanic arts (2, pp. 62-64). The Hatch Act of 
1887 provided for agricultural experiment stations in each state 
and territory (2, pp. 64-66), and during the following year the 
Office of Experiment Stations was created as a separate bureau 
of the Department to serve as the official head of all the agri- 
cultural experiment stations. 
On July 1, 1862, the United States Department of Agri- 
culture was organized. Its growth as expressed in terms of 
people employed and total expenditures may be seen by com- 
paring 29, the number employed the first year, with 17,819, the 
number employed in 1908, and $63,704.21 expended the first year 
with $13,628,696 expended in 1908. For the last twenty years 
Congress has provided liberally for the maintenance of the De- 
partment. It has been estimated that nearly $100,000,000 has 
been spent during this time for agricultural research and edu- 
cation, for the most part through the Department. This vast 
expenditure, of course, would never have been made had it not

been justified by results as measured in dollars and cents. In 
1908 the agricultural products of our country amounted to 
$7,778,000,000. The value of the corn crop alone amounted to 
$1,615,000,000. It may be readily seen that a very slight in- 
crease in yield per acre would aggregate many times the run- 
ning expenses of all the institutions engaged in promoting agri- 
culture. The work of the Department has made possible not 
only a slight increase but in nearly all kinds of production a 
very large increase (2, pp. 44-46). 
The aim of the Department has been twofold: first, scientific, 
developing a scientific knowledge of every phase of agriculture; 
second, educational, conveying this knowledge to all the people. 
In both these aspects of its work the Department has been closely 
allied with the land-grant agricultural colleges. Indeed, the 
Department and the agricultural experiment stations in differ- 
ent states and territories, organized chiefly as departments of 
land-grant colleges, stand at the head of our system of agri- 
cultural research and education. 
Since 1889 the Association of American Agricultural Col- 
leges and Experiment Stations has beer holding annual meet- 
ings. Members of the Department take prominent part in these 
meetings, and the proceedings are published through the Office 
of Experiment Stations. The director of this office is chair- 
man and the specialist in agricultural education is secretary. 
The educational policy of agricultural colleges, such as terms of 
admission, courses of study, matters of administration, etc., is 
determined largely by a standing committee of this association 
known as the “committee on instruction in agriculture.” For 
several years agricultural instruction of collegiate grade has 
been well organized and on a good working basis. Recently the 
efforts of this committee have been directed to a consideration 
of instruction of secondary grade. A course of study has been 
worked out in considerable detail to serve as a model for schools 
contemplating such instruction (3, 4). Some attention has also 
been given to work in elementary schools (5, 20). 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 9 
The Department is organized into eleven scientific bureaus 
as follows: weather, animal industry, plant industry, forest serv- 
ice, chemistry, soils, entomology, biological survey, statistics, 
experimental stations, and public roads. All of these are doing 
much to encourage and help agricultural education throughout 
the country. In a general way they reach the people through 
publications, a great many of which are distributed free (6, 7, 9) 
while others are for sale at a nominal price (7, 8). Those for 
free distribution are as a rule written in a popular style, free 
from technical terms, and are easily understood by the aver- 
age reader. The series known as “Farmers’ Bulletins” contains 
contributions from all the bureaus and there is scarcely any 
phase of agriculture that has not received attention. These 
bulletins are especially useful to elementary and secondary 
schools giving instruction in agriculture (7). Many of them 
dealing with such subjects as birds, insects, tree planting, school 
gardening, and plant propagation would be useful in any ele- 
mentary or high school. 
Besides general contributions to agricultural education made 
by all the bureaus of the Department, certain bureaus are taking 
an active part in public education. 
The Weather Bureau from its central office at Washington 
and through its officials at various stations throughout the 
country is doing much to encourage the study of meteorology. 
During the school year a million or more children of the public schools 
make weather observations and study the daily weather maps and fore- 
casts. From its earliest days the Weather Bureau has co-operated to some 
extent in public-school work, and during the past ten years this co-operation 
has been widely extended. The public schools and the Weather Bureau 
have a mutual interest in the matter. The school authorities have found 
in the study of the weather with the assistance of the Weather Bureau a 
means of satisfying part of the requirements of modern methods of study; 
and the Weather Bureau is able through the school gradually to dispell 
popular superstitions and fallacious beliefs that have hampered its work 
. and to enable both the commercial and the agricultural world to make 
more intelligent and more complete use of the forecasts, special warnings, 
weather maps, and climatological publications (10, p. 267). 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
About 15 per cent of the daily issue of weather maps is used 
in the public schools. Lectures are given by officials of the 
Weather Bureau at teachers’ institutes and elsewhere. The 
policy of this bureau has been to assist the public schools in 
every way possible as far as general duties to the public will 
permit. 
The Forest Service is reaching the schools through its publi- 
cations, lantern slides, and other illustrative material concerning 
the conservation of the forests of our country. The Forest 
Service believes that “the public school should treat forestry as 
one of the important economic and public questions in the life 
of the world” (11, p. 6), and that forestry should have a promi- 
nent place in our education. “Below the secondary school 
forestry should form part of nature-study, arithnietic, and gen- 
eral geography; in the high school, of United States history, 
civics, physical geography, commercial geography, botany, agri- 
culture, and woodworking” (11, p. 7). One of the recent efforts 
of the Forest Service to co-operate with the public schools is 
through phenological studies of our native forest trees. On re- 
quest the Forest Service will send to any school a set of blanks 
on which to record observations on such matters as general 
character of country, situation of trees, character of season, 
date of swelling of buds, of bursting of buds, of beginning of 
leafing out, of general leafing out, of blossoming, of change of 
color in foliage, etc. (dates of fifteen special observations in all). 
These blanks are accompanied by a circular giving complete 
directions for study of trees and making records. This work 
is of great value not only in encouraging pupils to make a close 
acquaintance with trees, but also in the reaction that must come 
to them in feeling that they are materially assisting the govern- 
ment in its work. Similar phenological studies of common 
flowering plants have been carried on very successfully for a 
number of years by the public-school children of Canada under 
the direction of the Botanical Club of Canada. Suggestions 
for forest nurseries for public schools have also been prepared
-P-A-G-E-19
  
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Ir 
by the Forest Service (12). Directions are given in considerable 
detail showing just what to do to establish a nursery in con- 
nection with an average school. Three other publications are 
soon to be issued: Forestry in Nature-Study, Forestry in Agri- 
culture, and Forestry in Geography. 
The Bureau of Plant Industry has been especially active in 
promoting the movement for school gardens. At Washington, 
under direct supervision of the Bureau, experiments in school 
gardening have been carried on for several years. A part of 
the government grounds with a greenhouse has been devoted 
to this work. The Bureau sends to schools throughout the 
country special packages of vegetable and flower seeds accom- 
panied by circulars containing directions for planting and care 
of school gardens (13, 14). The Bureau also furnishes sets of 
one hundred samples of seeds of economic and wild plants put up in glass 
vials, labeled with Latin and common names and arranged in an herbarium 
tray for reference purposes. The seeds and the work of preparation are 
furnished by this office free of charge, but it is necessary for those desiring 
sets to supply the tray and vials used. These can be obtained at a cost of 
$1.50 from Messrs. Mackall Bros. 9th and H Streets, N.E., of this city 
[Washington, D.C.], to whom remittances should be made direct with the 
request that the material be forwarded to this office. At the same time 
kindly notify us that such remittance has been made.? 
Another phase of the work of this bureau is of especial 
interest because of its remarkable development during 1910 
and 1911. This is the Junior Demonstration Work among 
the boys of the southern states (15). A brief summary of 
this work is given in chap. xii. 
The following is a good summary of the educational work of 
the Office of Experiment Stations: 
While the other bureaus of this Department are doing valuable educa- 
tional work along the lines of research in which they are engaged the 
Office of Experiment Stations is the general agency of the Department for 
the promotion of agricultural education throughout the United States and 
is constantly enlarging the scope and extent of this branch of its work.

12 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The educational work of this Office is now organized into two branches, 
one dealing with agricultural colleges and schools and the other with farm- 
ers’ institutes and other forms of extension work in agriculture. The 
work of the Office relating to agricultural colleges and schools includes 
four general classes: (1) The collection and publication of information 
regarding the progress of agricultural education at home and abroad; 
(2) studies of different grades of American and foreign schools in which 
agriculture is taught; (3) work in co-operation with the Association of 
Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations and other important asso- 
ciations dealing with educational matters; and (4) the giving aid to agricul- 
tural colleges and local school authorities along the lines of agricultural 
education. This work is in charge of Mr. D. J. Crosby, as specialist in 
agricultural education. 
This branch of the Office conducts a department of agricultural educa- 
tion in the Experiment Station Record (17), prepares and publishes statistics, 
courses of study, circulars of information, and other literature relating to 
agricultural education, aids state and local school authorities in organizing 
agricultural courses in schools and colleges and in securing competent teach- 
ers, takes part in important agricultural conventions and conferences, aids 
teachers in securing suitable agricultural literature for their work, and, in 
short, acts as a clearing-house for agricultural education in this country 
(16, pp. 7, 8). 
The work of the Office dealing with farmers’ institutes and 
extension work is in charge of Professor John Hamilton, farm- 
ers’ institute specialist. Although all the work undertaken by 
this branch of the Office has to do with agricultural education 
as presented to adults, it also reaches the public schools indirectly 
through correspondence with persons interested in agricultural 
education by distributing agricultural literature, by preparing 
and editing bulletins, illustrated lectures, and courses of study 
for movable schools of agriculture (133, 143). In the movable 
schools of agriculture a course is offered for country school 
teachers including nature-study, school gardens and grounds, 
and school architecture, and sanitation (18, p. 6). 
The attitude and interest of the Department toward unifying 
our educational system, in so far as it concerns agriculture and 
country life, into a complete system extending from the ele- 
mentary schools, through the secondary schools, into the col-
-P-A-G-E-21
  
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 13 
leges and graduate schools has been well expressed by Assistant 
Secretary Willet M. Hays in a recent address (19, pp. 4, 5)- 
He says 2 
A movement is well begun to organize better, as a part of our great 
American school system, the secondary schools as to meet especially the 
needs of country life. This movement contemplates that, below and leading 
to our more than 60 state colleges of agriculture already established, we 
shall have 300 to 400 agricultural finishing schools—practically one in each 
country congressional district of ten or more counties, either separate or 
as a strong department of an existing institution. .... 
But vastly more important is the larger movement to establish a system 
of consolidated rural and village schools, and of courses in agriculture in 
town and city schools so near the homes of farm youth that something 
of instruction in agriculture, in home economics, and in social and civil 
affairs, as well as in the accepted subjects of a so-called general education, 
shall be taught to all the boys and girls of the farm. To meet this first 
need the consolidated rural school in the open country and the consolida- 
tion of rural schools about the villages and cities is rising rapidly into 
prominence along with the vocational high school; and many city and non- 
public schools of secondary and higher grade are seeking to add agricul- 
tural instruction to their courses of study..... 
It is conceded that the large and important task of supplying trained 
teachers for approximately 30,000 consolidated rural schools in our rich 
rural communities, for thousands of town and city schools, for 100,000 
small rural schools in isolated and sparsely settled communities, for 300 or 
400 large agricultural high schools, for 150 state normal schools, and for 
60 state colleges of agriculture may be taken up in a practical way and 
solved in one or two decades. The demand and organization for training 
teachers going forward together will meet with only the usual pioneering 
difficulties.

  CHAPTER II 
THE UNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION 
Agricultural education receives the attention of the Bureau 
of Education in several ways. These may conveniently be 
grouped under three heads: publications, land-grant colleges, and 
legislation. 
Having little administrative authority except that relating to 
land-grant colleges the Bureau has confined its efforts mainly 
to its publications and correspondence. “No other educational 
office of the world has done so extensive literary work as this 
office,” is the fine tribute paid by the Royal Prussian Commission 
of 1904 in its report to the Prussian Parliament. The Bureau’s 
publications consist of annual reports, special reports, circulars 
of information, and bulletins. 
The policy of the Bureau toward agricultural education re- 
cently expressed by the commissioner applies especially to its 
publications : 
It can do its best I think as a co-ordinating influence. It can bring to the 
notice of less favored institutions information concerning the experience of 
more advanced institutions. It can call attention from time to time to 
the relation of agricultural education to general education. It can survey the 
educational field and possibly point out dangers to be averted or weak places 
to be strengthened. It can, finally, discover things that need doing and are not 
attended to by any other agency, and can see that some part of such lack is 
supplied. So much as this I hope the Bureau of Education may be able to do 
for agricultural education. And so much as this, I may say, it will undertake 
to do as far as its resources will permit (22, p. 53). 
The Bureau has done much already in two ways: one by 
bringing to American educators the work of foreign countries, 
and the other by reviewing the work being done in various parts 
of this country. Of the former the most important are the 
accounts of agricultural education in Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
France, Germany, Great Britain, and Prussia. One of these 
publications on school gardens deserves special mention (23).

-P-A-G-E-23

It contains a very complete historical account of school gardens 
and has been extensively quoted in the school-garden literature 
of this country. Of the reviews of work in our own country 
two are noteworthy. One written at the beginning of the move- 
ment for instruction in elementary agriculture is made up chiefly 
of reprints of leaflets from Purdue and Cornell universities (24). 
The other, appearing in 1907, gives an account of the present 
status of agricultural education throughout the world (25). 
The first Morrill Act of 1862, the second Morrill Act of 1890, 
and the Nelson Act of 1907 providing for government aid to 
agricultural and mechanical colleges are administered by the 
Department of the Interior (21, p. 31). 
The annual payments under the acts of 1890 and 1907 are made on certifi- 
cations of the Secretary of the Interior, which are based upon the proper ex- 
penditure of preceding appropriations. All of these reports required to be 
made by the act are collected and passed upon by the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, upon whose recommendation is based the action of the secretary 
(21, p. 32). 
While the duties of the Commissioner of Education in his 
relation to land-grant colleges consist chiefly in gathering sta- 
tistics and making reports to the Secretary of the Interior he 
has opportunities for making suggestions and recommendations 
of importance to agricultural education. For example, in his 
letter of April 17, 1907, to the presidents and boards of control 
of state colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts he calls atten- 
tion to a provision of the act of 1907 “providing for courses for 
special preparation of instructors for teaching the elements of 
agriculture and mechanic arts” and adds, “With the increasing 
number of secondary schools of agriculture and of industrial 
and trade schools, there will arise a considerable demand for 
specially prepared teachers to give instruction in special branches 
of study” (26, p. 870). In his report of 1908 to the Secretary 
of the Interior he gives an account of the action of several insti- 
tutions taking advantage of this provision (27, pp. 740, 741). 
On July 1, 1909, the Bureau appointed a specialist in land- 
grant college statistics who is expected also to pay attention to 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
16 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the general subject of agricultural education and to be able to 
furnish information and advice concerning that subject. 
The Commissioner of Education holds an important advisory 
position with reference to any proposed national legislation con- 
cerning education, particularly agricultural education. During 
the sixtieth session of Congress several bills were introduced 
providing for national aid to education in agriculture and other 
industrial subjects. Of these the most important were the 
Burkett bill (S. 3,392) providing for “the advancement of in- 
struction in agriculture, manual training, and home economics 
in the state normal schools of the United States,” and the Davis 
bill (H.R. 534) providing in a similar way for national aid to 
agricultural and industrial education in the secondary schools 
only. The latter was finally revised (H.R. 18,204) so as to 
include the provisions of the Burkett bill (S. 3,392). 
The Davis bill provides for annual appropriation of “ten 
cents per capita of the population of each state and territory and 
the District of Columbia” for aid to maintain instruction in 
agriculture and home economics in agricultural schools of sec- 
ondary grade, and an appropriation of one cent per capita to 
maintain similar instruction in state and territorial normal 
schools (24, pp. 85-87). 
The large amount of money concerned, and the establishment 
of separate schools not*already a part of our national system of 
education called for careful study and deliberation. The Bureau 
of Education was freely consulted in the matter. No one had 
a clearer insight into the far-reaching influence of the bill, a 
clearer understanding of its importance upon the economic and 
educational welfare of the nation, or a greater appreciation of 
the principles involved in such legislation, than the Commissioner 
of Education. In a letter dated September 26, 1907, to Mr. 
Davis he says: 
One strong argument in favor of such national aid, when extended to 
special forms of education which are in special need of encouragement, may 
be drawn from the workings of the appropriation for support of land-grant 
colleges, contained in the second Morrill Act of August 30, 1890. The recent
-P-A-G-E-25
  UNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION Ly 
effect of the national appropriations under that act has been to stimulate 
greatly the support of the land-grant colleges by the states in which they 
are situated. 
He calls attention to a provision of the measure giving adminis- 
trative authority over the appropriations therein provided to 
the Department of Agriculture, whereas “appropriations which 
are primarily for agriculture are now administered by the De- 
partment of Agriculture, and these which are primarily for edu- 
cation (land-grant colleges) are administered by the Bureau of 
Education.” 
I think [he says] as matters now stand this is a good working division, 
particularly as the relations between the Bureau of Education and the Office 
of Experiment Stations of the Department of Agriculture are very close 
and cordial. Educational interests are becoming so strongly unified through- 
out this country, and in fact in foreign lands, that the present tendency 
points to unifying of government activities of a purely educational sort, or 
of predominantly educational sort, under the Office of Education. Another 
reason for bringing the activities provided in your bill under the Bureau of 
Education is that they deal not only with agricultural high schools but 
with high schools of mechanic arts in cities as well. In institutions of 
both classes, while industrial ends are sought and industrial means employed, 
the main purpose, as I understand it, is educational. 
It seems to me worth considering, also, the question whether it is 
advisable that rural schools, to which the bill relates, should in all cases be 
designated as agricultural high schools. There is still a good deal of differ- 
ence of opinion as to whether high-school work in agriculture may be 
done to best advantage in general high schools which are properly equipped 
on the agricultural side, or in agricultural high schools which pay incidental 
attention to studies other than agriculture. It is likely, in fact, that we 
shall have institutions of both types for many years to come, and that both 
of them will do good and efficient work in the promotion of agricultural 
education. For this reason it seems to me doubtful whether it is wise to 
limit the distribution of the fund by using the distinctive designation of 
agricultural high school. 
In a letter to Senator Proctor, dated March 4, 1908, the whole 
matter of national aid as proposed by the Burkett bill and by the 
Davis bill is carefully reviewed. The entire letter should be read 
in order to form a just conclusion of the Commissioner’s position. 
After citing the difficulties arising from our complex industrial
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
situation, both urban and rural, he recognizes the probable need 
of federal aid in the following words: 
For all these reasons (referring to our industrial situation) the problem 
of a better education of an industrial type, in both country and city, has 
steadily become more acute. It is extremely doubtful whether these growing 
needs can be met in the near future in the majority of the states, unless the 
encouragement of federal appropriations be added to the efforts of the 
states and of local communities. 
While approving the measure in principle he urges “that any 
forward step which the national government may take in the 
encouragement of public education should be carefully weighed, 
and given its proper place in a well-digested general policy.” 
Furthermore, the conditions in several states are widely different, 
and any bill should be framed with a full knowledge of these 
differing conditions in order that it may be made sufficiently 
flexible to accomplish the best results in all parts of the country. 
In order “to make possible for Congress to act on bills like S. 
3,392 with full knowledge of the situation and needs of the 
country” he recommends that a commission be appointed to make 
a thorough investigation of the question and “report to Congress 
on or before January 1, 1910.” 
Neither the Davis bill nor the Commissioner’s recommenda- 
tion became a law. The bill was an indication of the interest of 
the country at large in extending agricultural education into the 
elementary and secondary schools. The attitude of the Bureau 
of Education was one of accord with the general principles on 
which the measure was based, but at the same time one of 
caution, recognizing that national appropriation to agricultural 
education, when given, should be of the greatest possible service.” 
* For permission to quote from letters to Congressmen Davis and Senator Proctor, and for 
other assistance in getting material for this chapter, the writer is indebted to Commissioner 
Elmer Ellsworth Brown. A portion of his letter to Senator Proctor appears in the Commis- 
sioner’s Report of 1908. 
*The provisions of the Davis bill have been revised and amended and presented at each 
session of Congress. In its present form (Page bill, 1912) it has a much wider scope than the 
original Davis bill. Dr. P. P. Claxton, United States Commissioner of Education, is not only 
actively interested in the proposed legislation, but is making an active campaign for the 
betterment of rural schools.

CHAPTER III 
STATE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION AND STATE 
LEGISLATION 
Each state or territory has at the head of its school system a 
central office. This office is administered in most states by a 
state superintendent or state commissioner of education, and in 
some states, as in Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, and 
Massachusetts, by a state board of education through its secre- 
tary or commissioner (29). 
These state offices vary in details and plan of organization, 
and somewhat in authority over educational matters, but are alike 
in essential respects. But however efficient the departmental 
organizations, the personality and aggressiveness of those in 
charge count for much in the influence that these offices exert 
in the educational welfare of their respective states. 
It is especially true that the introduction of a new subject of 
instruction like agriculture may be greatly hindered or promoted 
by the attitude taken by the state office. If favorable, the subject 
may be recommended for legislation, it may be put in the course 
of study, a textbook may be adopted, through personal influence 
on local boards it may be introduced in certain sections of the 
state, interest may be aroused by making it a reading-circle sub- 
ject, special publications may be issued to help teachers who wish 
to teach the subject, by promoting interest through clubs or other 
organizations. The main facts concerning the efforts of all the 
states and territories in the promotion of agricultural education 
in the elementary and secondary schools through their central 
offices of education and by legislation are indicated in the follow- 
ing tabulation. 
In Delaware interest in agricultural education has not seemed 
to warrant any attention from its state department of educa- 
tion. Kentucky, although it is an agricultural state, has

  STATE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION 25 
apparently shown much less interest in agricultural education 
than have other southern states. This may be readily explained 
by the fact that until 1908 the public-school system was organized 
under the old district plan. The schools were practically con- 
trolled by about 25,000 school trustees, 5,000 of whom could 
neither read nor write. The action of the legislature of 1908 
has changed the whole aspect of the Kentucky educational situa- 
tion, and already remarkable progress has been made toward 
the improvement of her public schools. 
A glance at the tabulation shows that the southern states have 
been more active (at least recently) in the promotion of agri- 
cultural education than the northern states. This activity is a 
part of the general educational movement extending throughout 
the South. Educational campaigns have recently been conducted 
in several of these states and have done much to increase interest 
in all educational matters. 
The earliest legislation concerning introduction of agriculture 
into elementary schools was the Nixon law of New York in 1897 
(24, pp. 1610--14). It provided for the extension of agriculture 
into the public schools under the direction of the Agricultural Col- 
lege of Cornell University. It was carried out by means of visits 
to schools and lectures before teachers’ institutes, and by means 
of teachers’ and pupils’ leaflets for use in rural schools. The 
Cornell leaflets not only stimulated much interest in elementary 
agriculture and nature-study in the state of New York but in 
other states as well. Similar publications have since been issued 
by agricultural colleges of several other states. 
Requiring the teaching of elementary agriculture by law has 
not met with unqualified success. In some states where it is 
supposed to be in force little attention is paid to it on account of 
lack of qualified teachers. The establishment of state secondary 
schools of agriculture and provision for state aid to high schools 
teaching agriculture is probably the most important recent legis- 
lation concerning agricultural education. The latter form of 
state aid seems to be growing in favor. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  
26 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Courses of study vary much in their treatment of agriculture 
as a school subject. The newness of the subject is usually recog- 
nized by special directions and suggestions for teaching. These 
are generally given in a state school manual or handbook for 
teachers. In some states they are in separate publications. In 
New York, for example, suggestions are outlined in syllabi, one 
for elementary schools and one for high schools. In other states 
bulletins on certain phases of the subject are issued, as in Michi- 
gan. 
Perhaps the most significant fact showing the widespread 
general interest in agricultural education in elementary and sec- 
ondary schools is the attitude of the administrative officers of the 
various state departments of education. Special mention of the 
subject is made in nearly all of the latest annual or biennial re- 
ports from these offices. In some reports considerable space is 
given to discussions of industrial education with particular refer- 
ence to agriculture. 
Finally, if any interpretation is to be made of the attitude of 
state departments of education toward agricultural education it 
must be remembered that these offices represent the people, and 
that any policy or action taken is in a certain sense an ex- 
pression of public opinion.

CHAPTER IV 
SUMMARY OF STATE LEGISLATION AND OF WORK OF STATE 
DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION FOR roro-11" 
The general discussion in the previous chapter of the attitude 
of states toward agricultural education in elementary and sec- 
ondary schools as shown by legislation and state departments of 
education was based on data collected for the years previous 
to 1910. In order to bring the subject up to date, and to show 
the rate of progress in the development of agricultural education 
in elementary and secondary schools as expressed in legislation 
and in the activities of state departments of education the fol- 
lowing summary by states is presented: 
Arkansas.—The four agricultural high schools provided for 
by the legislature of 1909 opened in the fall of 1910 with a 
large attendance. The state provides about $20,000 per year 
for support and maintenance of each of these schools. State 
aid is also provided for high schools meeting certain require- 
ments fixed by the State Board of Education (Act 328, Laws 
of 1911). Although the law does not specify that agriculture 
shall be taught in these schools, the additional support re- 
ceived by them will no doubt enable many to give instruction 
in this subject as was suggested by the Educational Commission 
of Arkansas in its report recommending the passage of this 
act. The state office of education is active in its co-operation 
with the boys’ agricultural-club movement. In addition to the 
boys’ corn clubs already being promoted, rural-school poultry 
clubs are to be organized in 1911-12. 
California.—High-school boards may prescribe an additional 
course, or additional courses of study, “including instruction in 
manual training, domestic science and art, agriculture, horti- 
culture, and dairying, to be duly credited as part of such high-

school work” (Cal. Political Code, Sec. 1750, May 1, 1911). 
The state office of education is especially active in promoting 
agricultural education, co-operating with the college of agri- 
culture of the state university. 
Idaho.—Rural high schools are established with agricultural 
instruction as part of the course of study. The subject of agri- 
culture lis put on the list of subjects required in examination 
for county certificates for teaching. 
Iowa.—An act of the last legislature provides for the es- 
tablishment of departments for training of teachers in agriculture 
and home economics in forty high schools, and appropriates 
$500 special state aid for each of these schools. 
Kansas.—A sum of $250 annually is available to such high 
schools maintaining normal training? as may organize courses in 
agriculture and domestic science under rules and regulations 
to be formulated by the state board of education. This pro- 
vision is also extended to such high schools as may hereafter 
introduce normal training. A law was also passed requiring 
an examination in agriculture for all forms of county teachers’ 
certificates. 
Louisiana.—During the years 1910-11 agricultural depart- 
ments were established in seventeen high schools, and the legisla- 
ture of 1910 appropriated $25,000 per annum for the years 
1910-11 to aid these schools. No more than twenty agricultural 
departments will be recognized during the sessions of IgI0-I1 
and 1911-12. The following is a summary of requirements 
made by the state board of education for the departments of 
agriculture of schools receiving state aid: A demonstration 
farm of at least five acres, which must be tightly fenced, and 
provided with barn containing full equipment; apparatus for 
teaching science, with an addition of at least $100 worth of 
apparatus especially for teaching agriculture; at least $40 worth 
of tools and $140 worth of farming implements, and $250 for

legislature.

maintenance; the teacher of agriculture must be satisfactory to 
the state department of education. To aid the department of 
agriculture and home economics of these schools a course of 
study, including state requirements for recognition, equipment, 
courses of study and practicums, has been issued by the state 
department of education (32). 
Maine.—State aid is given to high schools and incorporated 
academies maintaining courses in agriculture. 
Maryland.—State aid, not to exceed $2,500 each, is extended 
for the encouragement of high schools meeting the requirements 
set forth by the state board of education. Among these re- 
quirements is provision for manual-training and domestic-science 
courses, and also a commercial or agricultural course, as may 
be determined by the board of county commissioners. In the 
suggested course of agriculture for high schools two recitations 
of forty minutes each and one double laboratory period of eighty 
minutes are devoted to this subject each week for four years. 
The course is so arranged that a teacher of agriculture may 
teach in more than one high school, giving not less than two- 
fifths of his time to schools of the first group, and to no more 
than four schools of the second group. The sum of $400 is 
available to high schools of each group offering such instruction 
(School Code and By-Laws of the Maryland State Board of 
Education). 
Massachusetts—An act of the legislature of 1911 provides 
for agricultural departments in rural high schools. Such de- 
partments must devote their entire time to the theory and 
practice in agriculture. This work may be elected by pupils in 
the school. The pupils are to take all their studies except the 
training in practical farming in the regular classes of the 
school. The work is to be given by a special instructor who 
is to devote his entire time to the theory and practice of farming. 
He will be expected to supervise certain projects on the farm 
conducted by pupils, such as gardening, poultry-keeping, orchard- 
ing, small animal husbandry, etc., and to give in the classroom

the applied science, mathematics, etc., that may be necessary 
in order to bring about the practice of right methods. This 
teacher is not to teach any of the regular sciences in the 
school or any other subject save those that may be neces- 
sary to the group with which he deals in practical agri- 
culture. The state is to pay two-thirds of the salary of the 
instructor. The board of education has asked for $10,000 for 
the years 1911-12 in order to test the worth of this scheme.* 
Some of the details of this plan for part time or project method 
of agricultural instruction are given in chap. xiii, p. 125. In 
addition to the Report of the State Board of Education on 
Agricultural Education (166) referred to in chap. xiii, the 
board has issued a bulletin on Agricultural Projects for Ele- 
mentary Schools (33), the general scheme being the same as 
for projects for high schools. 
Michigan.—The State Commission on Industrial and Agri- 
cultural Education appointed by the governor of Michigan in 
the summer of 1909 has made in its report the following 
recommendations: (1) provision of at least one high school 
with a four-year course in each township; (2) introduction as 
soon as possible of agriculture, manual training, and home 
economics into all high schools; (3) certification of all teachers 
of agricultural and industrial subjects; (4) state supervision 
of all agricultural and industrial courses; (5) state aid for 
schools introducing high-school courses in agriculture and home 
economics, as follows: (a) the total not to exceed $30,000 
for the first year, $50,000 for the third year, and $100,000 for 
any subsequent year; (b) an equal division of the funds be- 
tween agriculture and home economics on the one hand and 
industrial courses on the other; (c) schools certified for aid 
in agriculture and home economics to receive $500 for the first 
teacher employed, and $250 for each other teacher employed, no 
school to receive more than $1,000 in all (Rpt. Mich. State Com. 
on Indus. and Agric., 1910).

  SUMMARY OF STATE LEGISLATION 31 
Minnesota.—Three important laws relating to teaching of 
agriculture and industrial work were passed by the legislature 
of IgII: 
1. The Putnam Act amends chap. 247, General Laws of 
1909, providing for state aid of $2,500 annually to high schools 
maintaining agricultural and industrial education, so as to author- 
ize rural schools to become associated with such state-aided high 
schools. The purpose of this amendment is to provide “training 
and instruction in such agricultural and industrial departments 
for pupils in rural schools, and to extend the supervision and 
influence of state high or graded schools to rural schools; one 
or more schools may become associated with a high or graded 
school in which is maintained an agricultural and industrial de- 
partment as herein provided.” Each high school entitled to re- 
ceive state aid of $2,500 per year may receive, in addition, $150 
per year for each associated school district, and each school 
district forming such an association may receive $50 per year 
(Putnam Act, Laws of 1911). Thirty high schools during 
Ig1I-12 will each receive $2,500 of state aid. A number of 
these will receive additional state aid through their association 
with school districts as provided for in the Putnam Act. 
2. “Any high school or graded school which shall maintain 
such a course as the High School Board of this state shall 
prescribe in agriculture and either in home economics or in 
manual training shall receive annually in addition to other aid 
the sum of $1,000 for maintaining such industrial courses, to 
be appropriated and paid from the appropriation made for state 
aid to high and graded schools” (Benson-Lee Act, Laws of 
Ig11). About sixty high schools will receive the benefits of 
this law during the school year 1911-12. 
3. Encouragement for consolidation of rural schools is ex- 
tended by the state through the Holmberg Act. Schools are 
classified as A, B, and C; schools of class A to have at least 
four departments; those of class B, three departments; those 
of class C, two departments. Each school of class A shall 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
receive $1,500; of class B, $1,000; of class C, $750. The 
principal of each school in any of these classes shall be qualified 
“to teach the elements of agriculture as determined by the state 
superintendent of public instruction’ (Holmberg Act, Laws of 
IQII). 
Mississippi An act to provide for the establishment of 
county agricultural high schools and to provide for the equip- 
ment and maintenance of the same” was approved March 16, 
1910 (chap. 122, Annotated Code of School Laws of Missis- 
sippi). According to provisions of this act any town or rural 
community in a county may bid for the location of an agri- 
cultural high school. But no bid will be considered that does 
not guarantee to the county a donation of at least twenty acres 
of land, suitable school building, and a dormitory with dining- 
room facilities to accommodate forty boarders. If no com- 
munity makes such a donation the above equipment may be 
secured out of any tax levy made for agricultural high-school 
purposes. When such a school is established it may receive state 
aid to the amount of $1,500 annually. The state department 
of public instruction has issued a course of study and general 
directions for conduct of these schools (34). 
Montana.—The superintendent of public instruction urges 
that the subject of agriculture be given the time assigned to 
it in the state course of study. In this course the subject is 
outlined for the pupils of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades. 
Nebraska.—Although there is no new legislation on agri- 
cultural education, considerable interest is shown in the subject of 
normal training courses (including agriculture) in high schools. 
A bill somewhat similar to those passed in Kansas and Iowa 
providing for agricultural instruction in normal training 
courses in high schools and including state aid was presented at 
the last legislature, but failed to pass. 
Nevada.—Provision is made in the course of study for in- 
struction in agriculture. Three high schools will give courses 
in agriculture in 1911-12.
-P-A-G-E-41
  SUMMARY OF STATE LEGISLATION 33 
New Hampshire-—During the years 1911-12 seven regularly 
approved high schools will give courses in agriculture. An 
approved school must employ only graduates of recognized agri- 
cultural colleges to give instruction in agriculture. The high- 
school law of 1901 makes it possible to introduce the subject 
of agriculture into any high school of any community desiring 
it. In the state course of study for elementary schools agri- 
culture is given a place. 
New Jersey.—Legislation relating indirectly to agricultural 
education is found in the provision made for a state commissioner 
of education who has, with the consent of the state board of 
education, the power to appoint four assistant commissioners, 
one of whom is to devote his time “to the inspection of industrial 
education, including agriculture.” 
New York.—In 1910 the state made provision for state aid 
to high schools giving instruction in agriculture. The sum of 
$500 may be apportioned to any city or union free school 
district maintaining a school of agriculture, mechanic arts, and 
home-making for thirty-eight weeks in a year, subject to approval 
of the state commissioner of education (162). Twenty schools 
have definitely adopted the special agricultural course for the 
year 1911-12, and will receive state aid. The New York plan 
is discussed in some detail in chap. xiii, p. 123. In the law 
of 1910 relating to agricultural education provision is also made 
for the training of teachers of agriculture for high schools at 
the state schools of agriculture at St. Lawrence University, at 
Alford University, and at Morrisville. 
North Carolina.—An act was passed by the legislature of 
IQ11 providing for the establishment and maintenance of county 
farm-life schools and for the promotion of agriculture and home- 
making (County Farm-Life School law, ratified March 3, 1911). 
“The aim of said school shall be to prepare boys for agricultural 
pursuits and farm life and to prepare the girls for home-making 
and housekeeping on the farm. The course of study in said 
school shall be subject to the approval of the state superintendent 
of public instruction and an advisory board in farm-life schools, 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  34 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
to be appointed by him; Provided, however, that the course of 
study shall include practical work on the farm, and practical 
work in all subjects relating to housekeeping and home-making 
by the girls.” The state appropriates $25,000 to each school 
to aid in maintenance and support. The school cannot be lo- 
cated in any city or town of more than one thousand inhabitants, 
nor within two miles of any city or town of more than five 
thousand inhabitants. A complete equipment consisting of 
school building, dormitory buildings, barn and dairy building, 
asfarm of not less than twenty-five acres of good land, and neces- 
sary furnishing, apparatus, and farm tools, all of which must 
be approved by the state superintendent of public instruction. 
Provision is also made for a high-school department to be 
maintained in each farm-life school that may not be established at 
the same place with some existing county high school. In addi- 
tion to the aim already indicated, it is intended for each school 
“to conduct agricultural and farm-life demonstration and ex- 
tension work throughout the country; to hold township and 
district meetings for the farmers and farmers’ wives in all parts 
of the county from time to time; to co-operate with the county 
superintendent of public instruction and public-school teachers 
in stimulating, directing, and supervising farm-life work in the 
public high schools and elementary schools, and in providing 
instruction in such work for the teachers through the County 
Teachers’ Association and through special short courses of study 
for public-school teachers; to provide, also, at said school short 
courses of study in farm-life subjects for adult farmers and 
their wives, and to hold at the school county meetings for farmers 
and their wives for instruction and demonstration work from 
time to time.” Under provisions of this law two counties have 
voted for such schools, and several more have the matter under 
consideration and will call elections later. 
North Dakota.—Three important measures in the interest of 
agricultural education became laws in 1911. Agriculture is made 
one of four optional subjects in examinations for first-grade 
teachers’ certificates. This will probably be amended later, mak-
-P-A-G-E-43
SUMMARY OF STATE LEGISLATION 35 
ing agriculture one of the required subjects. State aid is to be 
given to rural and graded schools. These are of two classes, 
but among the requirements for both classes are courses in 
domestic science, manual training, and elementary agriculture. 
Provision is made for the establishment of county agricultural 
and training schools. “Each of said schools shall receive state 
aid in the sum of $2,500..... Not more than five schools 
shall be aided the first year nor more than five be added every 
two years thereafter.”” A state agricultural and training board 
is also created. This board “shall consist of the president of the 
state agricultural college, the state superintendent of public in- 
struction, and three practical farmers, who shall be appointed 
by the governor of the state. 
Ohio.—An act to provide for the teaching of agriculture in 
the common schools became a law in 1911, but does not apply 
to city school districts of the state. The act requires “that the 
state be divided into four agricultural districts to be mapped 
out, located, and defined by the commissioner of common schools. 
. ... The state commissioner shall also superintend all such 
agricultural education designated in this act and shall appoint 
in each agricultural district a person known as district super- 
visor of agriculture.” Among the duties of this officer are 
visiting and co-operating with the several boards of education 
in his district in planning such a course of study in agriculture 
as they may think best adapted to the needs of the people of the 
respective school districts; visiting the county teachers’ institute 
in every county in his district, and giving instruction in agri- 
culture to the teachers of the several schools designated in this 
act; co-operating with the state board of agriculture, and giving 
the state such time as may be necessary to lecture on agricultural 
subjects as are related to teaching in the common schools; en- 
couraging county agricultural societies in each county of his 
district to establish school children’s agricultural exhibits at 
each annual county fair. The sections of the political code 
relating to teachers’ examinations is amended so as to include 
“on and after September 1, 1912, elementary agriculture.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  36 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Pennsylvania.—The new school code provides for the ap- 
pointment of an expert assistant in agriculture for the state 
department of education and makes agricultural education a 
part of the objects to be promoted by the state board of education. 
Texas.—State aid to the amount of from $500 to $2,000 
is given for one year to high schools providing approved in- 
struction in agriculture. 
Utah.—Agriculture is made a part of the course of study 
prepared by the state office of education for accredited high 
schools. 
Vermont.—The state department of education has issued a 
Manual of Agriculture for the Public Schools of Vermont (35)- 
Washington.—Elementary agriculture is made an optional 
subject in the eighth grade of the public schools of the state. 
Wisconsin.—An act passed in 1911 makes available to each 
school “maintaining a department of manual training, or do- 
mestic economy or agriculture, or any or all of these departments 
one-half the amount actually expended for instruction in such 
department, not, however, to exceed $350 for each department 
above named which shall have been maintained in connection 
with the high school and the three upper grades below the high 
school, but not to exceed $250 for each department named 
maintained only in connection with the high school.” It is 
possible under this act for a school district maintaining courses 
in these three subjects to receive $1,050 per year from the state. 
No state aid may be given to any school for instruction in 
agriculture, domestic economy, manual training, or industrial 
branches unless the salary of every teacher giving instruction 
in such subjects shall receive at least $60 per month. 
The maximum state aid to any county school of agriculture 
anddomestic economy is raised from $4,000 per annum to $6,000- 
$8,000 per annum, depending upon average daily attendance. 
The Stout Institute located at Menomonie is to receive state 
support, $30,000 for the current year and $55,000 per annum 
thereafter.

  CHAPTER V 
AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES, INCLUDING EXTENSION WORK, 
DEPARTMENTS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, AND 
SUMMER SCHOOLS FOR TEACHERS 
Of the many agencies now promoting agricultural education 
in elementary and secondary schools the most important are the 
state agricultural colleges, for they are the “only teaching insti- 
tutions that are in possession, at first hand, of the essential facts 
of rational agriculture.” Until recently they have been too busy 
perfecting their own organization, and too greatly occupied in 
developing and promoting the scientific aspects of agriculture to 
give much attention to outside educational matters. It is difficult 
to determine just when the agricultural colleges began to take an 
active interest in the public schools. Dean L. H. Bailey says: 
More than any other institutions they stand for democracy and native- 
ness of education, for their purpose is nothing less than to reach the last 
man on the last farm by means of the very things by which that man lives 
(36, p. 40). 
This idea of bringing the college to the people found its first 
expression in various sorts of extension work dealing with the 
farmers directly. Now this work is well organized and is doing 
great service. Through farmers’ institutes, farmers’ conventions, 
farmers’ excursions to the college, instruction trains, demonstra- 
tion farms, and other means, the man on the farm is having the 
college brought to him. These efforts of the colleges are now 
appreciated; so much in fact, that it is often difficult for a college 
to meet the demands for this kind of outside instruction. But 
the farmer has not always had this friendly attitude. He was 
slow to recognize the value of what he called “book farming.” 
Perhaps it was in these early days of agricultural extension that 
some of those in charge thought it worth while to give some 
attention to the coming generation of farmers, to the children in 
the public schools. 
38
-P-A-G-E-47
  AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXTENSION WORK 39 
Doubtless many individuals connected with agricultural col- 
leges had put this idea into practice and had helped to introduce 
agricultural subjects in some of the public schools long before 
any college took official notice of this means of extension. The 
first college to take this matter up was the Agricultural College 
of Cornell University. Reference has already been made to 
this work under the Nixon law of 1897.1. It assumed consider- 
able importance at once. The report of 1898 concerning this 
work says: 
Thirty thousand teachers are enrolled on our lists and have received 
leaflets, and many have attended lectures explaining the methods of pre- 
senting nature-study work in the schools. Sixteen thousand children have 
received those leaflets which are especially adapted to their needs (24, p. 
1611). 
This work is administered by a department of the college 
known as the Nature-Study Bureau and consists of publications, 
correspondence, organization of boys’ and girls’ clubs, and lec- 
tures and demonstrations for teachers. Other agricultural col- 
leges soon took up similar work in their respective states until 
now nearly all are doing more or less extension work among the 
public schools. At present agricultural colleges are assisting 
agricultural education in the elementary and secondary schools 
(a) by various extension methods, (b) by organizing depart- 
ments of agricultural education, and (c) by conducting summer 
schools for teachers. 
Extension methods vary somewhat in different states. This 
is probably due to differences in local conditions, state support, 
and policies of the colleges themselves. Usually each college 
develops one particular method of reaching the schools although 
it may use several. Several colleges follow the Cornell plan 
(37, 38) of regular publications for teachers and pupils, for 
example, the agricultural colleges of California (39), Kansas 
(40), Ohio (41), New Hampshire (42), Rhode Island (43), 
and West Virginia (44). Purdue University, Indiana, and 
Pennsylvania State College published regularly for a while 
* Chap. iii, p. 25. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
leaflets on nature-study. Others publish occasional bulletins on 
various phases of public-school agriculture, for example, the agri- 
cultural colleges of Massachusetts (45, 46, 47, 48), Illinois (49), 
Minnesota (53), Missouri (50), Pennsylvania (51), Tennessee 
(52), and California (54, 55). Material designed to aid 
teachers is sometimes prepared by faculty members of an agri- 
cultural college, for example, of the agricultural colleges of 
California (56), Illinois (58), and Michigan (57), to be pub- 
lished by the state department of education or by some school 
magazine. 
These extension publications are distributed free of charge 
and often large editions have to be reprinted to meet the 
demand. The extension bulletin of Ohio State Agricultural 
College (41), for example, is printed in editions of from 
10,000 to 20,000. The mailing-list is made up anew each year 
from responses to notices that names will be dropped from 
the mailing-list unless requests are renewed. Pupils of the 
public schools are expected to carry on some work suggested 
by the college and report upon this work in order to receive 
the bulletin regularly. In this way the extension department 
is kept in close touch with the teachers and pupils of the 
state. The bulletin serves several purposes: it is a means of com- 
munication between the college and the schools; it presents vari- 
ous phases of agriculture of interest to the pupils; it assists in 
organizing agricultural clubs among the public-school children; 
it is the organ for promoting interest in rural-school improve- 
ment, such as consolidation of rural schools and beautifying 
school grounds. 
Each agricultural college has more or less correspondence 
among teachers and pupils but some colleges have encouraged it 
and made it a feature of their extension work. This method has 
the advantage that comes from establishing a sort of personal 
relation between the college and the individual. But the work 
involved in a correspondence dealing with several thousand indi- 
viduals is enormous and almost impossible for an agricultural
-P-A-G-E-49
  AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXTENSION WORK 41 
college, were personal answers given to each letter. A regular 
publication is necessary to outline and suggest work to be re- 
ported upon. The correspondence is really one-sided, for answers 
to individual letters may be given in the next publication or in cir- 
cular letters. Only a small percentage requires personal answers. 
The office work is thus reduced to filing and checking reports and 
preparing mailing-lists. The most extensive work of this kind 
has been carried on by Cornell University. “Uncle John,” who 
is supposed to read the letters, is more widely known and is more 
popular among the young people of New York rural communities 
than any other member of the university. This method is also 
used by the agricultural colleges of Ohio and Rhode Island. The 
agricultural colleges of Florida, Kansas, and Pennsylvania (59) 
conduct correspondence courses in agriculture for teachers. 
The most successful form of agricultural extension among 
public-school children has been agricultural clubs (60, 61).? 
They are now organized in nearly every state and are not only a 
means of imparting a knowledge of agriculture to their members, 
but have a wholesome reaction on the communities in which 
they are organized. The following is a statement of the work of 
boys’ clubs of Louisiana: 
This year, 1909, we have about 2,000 boys in our agricultural clubs. 
Next year we expect to have 10,000. I shall devote all of December, Jan- 
uary, and February to the organization of these clubs in every parish in 
Louisiana. The corn crop in Louisiana this year exceeds in yield by 50 
per cent the crop of 1908, and it is generally admitted that a large part of 
the increase is due to the interest created in corn during the last two years 
by the boys that are in the boys’ clubs. The best corn show ever held in 
Louisiana was that of the boys’ clubs at the State Fair at Shreveport the 
first days of this month.® 
The agricultural colleges of all the southern states are active 
in their co-operation with the government demonstration work 
among boys. The most complete state organization of boys’ and 
girls’ clubs is in Nebraska (60). Here the State Agricultural 
* Boys’ agricultural clubs are fully discussed in chap. xii.

College and the State Department of Education work together. 
The organization consists of a state association, and county and 
local or district associations. The central or state association 
meets once a year and is composed of delegates from county 
associations. ‘ 
A special course in agriculture and domestic science for boys and girls 
will be given at the State University Farm, beginning Monday, January 17, 
and ending Friday, January 21, 1900. This course is planned for the dele- 
gates from each county of boys’ and girls’ agricultural and domestic science 
associations. Special arrangements have been made with the professors at 
the University College of Agriculture to give a course of instruction last- 
ing five days..... The laboratories at the Agricultural College will be at 
the disposal of the delegates from the different counties during this week 
and professors from the college will give the instruction. The course is 
filled with interesting and instructive lectures and demonstrations (60, p. It). 
The agricultural colleges reach the public schools in various 
other ways. The extension department of Ohio State Agri- 
cultural College gives much of its attention to rural schools. 
The superintendent of agricultural extension in this institution 
believes that the most important work of his department lies in 
improving the rural schools, not only by helping to introduce 
agriculture, but by interesting the patrons in consolidating small 
district schools, in making other improvements, and by encoura- 
ging the teachers to adjust their school work to fit the needs of 
the communities in which they live. The Mississippi State Agri- 
cultural College gives a short course of one week each winter 
in the county agricultural high school. Many colleges send rep- 
resentatives to address teachers’ institutes and other teachers’ 
meetings. They also furnish judges for boys’ corn shows, and 
corn and stock-judging contests. 
The early extension work of agricultural colleges among the 
public schools was intended to awaken an interest in agricultural 
affairs. It was mainly propaganda for arousing a favorable 
sentiment toward the subject. The more recent work has had for 
its aim the actual introduction of certain phases of agriculture 
into the schools, and to render assistance to teachers who wish
-P-A-G-E-51
  AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXTENSION WORK 43 
to teach the subject. The demand on many colleges for this kind 
of work has become too great to be properly met by the regular 
extension departments. To meet this situation special depart- 
ments are being organized. These are usually known as depart- 
ments of agricultural education. The following tabulation 
shows the organization of these departments up to date:

The agricultural colleges of Arkansas, Delaware, Maine, 
Massachusetts, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South 
Dakota, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin give courses 
in education to their students who expect to become teachers. 
The Agricultural College of Tennessee added a department of 
agricultural education temporarily in 1908 for one year and 
expects to re-establish it. A number of other colleges have signi- 
fied their intention to establish departments of agricultural edu- 
cation as soon as practicable. 
It will be seen from the above summary that most of these 
new departments began their work in 1908 and 1909. This is 
probably due, at least in part, to a provision of the Nelson amend- 
ment of 1908 (26, 36, p. 5) whereby “said colleges may use a 
portion of this money (referring to additional appropriation) 
for providing courses for special preparation of instructors for 
teaching the elements of agriculture and mechanic arts.” 
Massachusetts in 1907 made a special appropriation of $5,000 
for this work (36, p. 41). In addition to the regular instruction 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
given during the school year and summer school for teachers, 
the department conducted, in 1908, 1909, and 1910, conferences 
on agricultural education (46). At the conference of 1909, a 
committee appointed in 1908 made a report outlining a series of 
exercises “of experimental character that should serve as material 
for the teaching of agriculture in the common schools” (45). 
The department has extended its work to include courses of in- 
struction during the college year to undergraduates expecting to 
teach; lectures before teachers’ and farmers’ meetings; summer- 
school instruction to teachers of elementary agriculture and 
school gardening; co-operative work with the North Adams 
State Normal School; organizing boys’ and girls’ agricultural 
clubs; conducting school gardens on college campus for the 
school children of Amherst. 
The departments of agricultural education in other colleges 
are just getting under way, and it is therefore not possible at 
this time to give any report of their work beyond a few brief 
statements. Boys’ clubs and teachers’ institutes are receiving 
special attention in several states. In Missouri the schools of 
the county in which the University of Missouri is located are 
taking up the study of agriculture under the direction of the 
professor of agricultural education who visits the schools with 
the county superintendent, gives instruction in the seventh and 
eighth grades and makes suggestions to the teachers for carrying 
on the work. In 1910-11 work in thirteen of these “demonstra- 
tion schools” was conducted, and about fifty others were reached 
by correspondence. The University of Illinois is pursuing a sim- 
ilar plan. In Indiana the department was established especially 
to enable the students of Purdue University to comply with the 
state law requiring teachers in the public schools to have some pro- 
fessional training. In the University of California the depart- 
ment of agricultural education is especially well organized, cover- 
ing the following lines of work: instruction to teachers during the 
regular and summer sessions; publication of circulars on school 
gardening, tree-growing, high-school agriculture, elementary
-P-A-G-E-53
AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXTENSION WORK 45 
agriculture, etc.; organizing and conducting school garden work 
in city and rural schools; conducting seed exchange with schools 
interested in tree-growing and gardening; conducting organiza- 
tions for the encouragement of nature-study; visiting, super- 
vising, and teaching in the public schools; assisting at teachers’ 
meetings; organizing excursions of teachers to university sta- 
tions; organizing boys’ and girls’ clubs and publishing a paper 
to unify this work; assisting with the demonstration train; cor- 
respondence with superintendents, principals, and teachers, and 
others interested in educational work. Various specialists of 
Kansas Agricultural College, under the direction of the depart- 
ment of agricultural education, have prepared a series of six 
agricultural primers. These have been placed in the hands of 
each teacher of the state, and have been used as a text in all 
the normal institutes during the summer of 1911. In general, 
these new departments seem to regard the development of agri- 
culture in high schools as an important part of their work. 
Mention should be made in this connection of the co-operation of 
the College of Agriculture of Cornell University and Teachers 
College of Columbia University for the training of students for 
special work as teachers of agriculture in high schools and normal 
schools. “Appropriate courses in agriculture are taken at Cor- 
nell University and the study of educational problems at Teachers 
College” (36, pp. 36-37). The Pennsylvania Agricultural Col- 
lege offers a special course of one year for graduates of normal 
schools and colleges who expect to teach in the public schools. 
The department of agricultural education is also giving instruc- 
tion by correspondence to a large number of teachers. The 
University of Wisconsin is making special effort to prepare 
teachers for work in secondary agriculture in the public schools. 
One course of study leads to the B.S. degree in agriculture, and 
to a university teachers’ certificate which requires a certain 
amount of work to be done in education; a second leads to the 
degree of A.B. with a minor in agriculture; a third leads to 
the degree of A.B. with a major in manual arts and a minor in
-P-A-G-E-54
    
46 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
agriculture; a fourth leads to the degree of B.S. in the college 
of agriculture with a minor in manual arts or physical or bio- 
logical science. 
The number of agricultural colleges giving summer courses 
for the benefit of teachers is increasing rapidly. During the 
year IQII courses were given in the agricultural colleges of 
the following states: Alabama, California, Connecticut, Georgia, 
Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, 
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, 
Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyo- 
ming, and perhaps others. These courses last from three to eight 
weeks and are well attended. The indications are that the 
attendance and interest will increase and that summer schools of 
agricultural colleges will become a considerable factor in ele- 
mentary and secondary agricultural education.

  CHAPTER VI 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS 
It is the business of state normal schools not only to train 
teachers but also, as far as conditions permit, to find out by ex- 
periment in practice schools, what to teach and how to teach it. 
When both aspects of the work of these schools are considered, 
the important relation which they bear to agricultural education, 
particularly in elementary schools, becomes apparent. The prob- 
lem of the normal school in this matter is twofold: (a) to meet 
the rapidly growing demand for teachers who are able to give 
satisfactory instruction in elementary agriculture, and (b) to 
reduce the subject to a proper pedagogical basis, in other words, 
to determine what phases of this great subject may be undertaken 
in the elementary schools under average school conditions both 
from the standpoint of the child and of the teacher. 
The following is a brief summary of the efforts of the state 
normal schools to find a solution of this twofold problem. The 
data have been gathered from one hundred and thirty-seven of 
the one hundred and forty-five schools now actively engaged in 
training teachers." 
When the diverse social, educational, and industrial interests 
of the country as a whole are considered it is to be expected that 
these differences will be reflected in the types of instruction given 
in the various normal schools. To these differences brought 
about by conditions more or less local are to be added those due 
to tradition. The older schools are usually less elastic and adapt- 
able than the newer ones. Bailey regards the latter fact as a 
very serious obstacle in the way of a general introduction of 
agriculture into these schools. He says, “One cannot look to 
all the existing normal schools in the older states, or even to any 
*In rozo the nine state normal schools of Oregon were closed, owing to lack of financial 
support from the state. 
47 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
considerable part of them, for the training of teachers for this 
kind of work” (36). This statement must be qualified for there 
are many exceptions. For example, the Johnson State Normal 
School of Vermont has been offering courses in agriculture for 
over eight years, while the one at Laramie, Wyoming, recently 
established, does not give courses in agriculture but prepares its 
graduates to teach in cities. 
The number of graduates of state normal schools that teach 
in agricultural communities varies exceedingly not only in 
different states but among the schools of a single state. Re- 
ports from seventy-six show that twenty-eight have from 60 
to 100 per cent of their graduates going into schools of rural 
communities; twenty-seven have from 20 to 50 per cent; and 
twenty-one have from I to Io per cent. Of the twenty-eight 
having from 60 to 100 per cent of their graduates teaching in 
rural communities, twenty are offering instruction in agriculture 
and fifteen require it; of those having from 20 to 50 per cent, 
twenty offer instruction in agriculture and nine require it; of 
those having from 1 to 10 per cent, eleven offer agriculture and 
three require it. If this proportion should apply to all the schools 
it would seem to indicate that the number of graduates of normal 
schools going into agricultural communities is quite large, per- 
haps larger than generally supposed. It indicates also a tendency 
of the schools to adapt their work, at least to the extent of intro- 
ducing agriculture, to the needs of the communities where their 
graduates teach. This estimate is only approximate and only 
inferences may be drawn from it. It does not take into con- 
sideration the large number of students who take a portion of the 
course and who for the most part go into the country to teach. 
One normal-school president says: “There are very few of our 
graduates who teach in rural schools, but there are multitudes of 
our undergraduates who do so.” This statement suggests an- 
other phase of the problem of normal-school instruction which 
has received little or no attention, viz., what recognition in the 
course of study or character of instruction should be given to the
-P-A-G-E-57
  STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS 49 
fact that so many who attend the normal school for part of the 
course drop out and become teachers in rural schools? For 
example, in the school just referred to, the instruction is evidently 
adjusted to meet the needs of students who expect to teach in 
city schools. No agriculture is taught although “multitudes 
of the undergraduates” become teachers in rural schools, and in 
the state itself agriculture is the chief industry. 
The development of agricultural instruction in state normal 
schools has on the whole kept pace with the growth of the general 
interest in the subject. It is hard to say just when this subject 
was first taken up. Probably the first institution to begin this 
work under the name of agriculture was the Rock Hill State 
Normal School of South Carolina, which offered courses in agri- 
culture as early as 1895. The Johnson State Normal School of 
Vermont offered its first course in agriculture in 1901, and about 
this time the subject was introduced in some of the state normal 
schools of the Middle West (62). 
In 1906 a report on “Preparation of Teachers to Give Instruc- 
tion in Elementary Agriculture” was prepared for the Joint Board 
of the California State Normal Schools trustees (63). This re- 
port showed that the normal schools of Minnesota, North Dakota, 
Nebraska, Missouri, and South Carolina were attempting to 
prepare teachers to give instruction in elementary agriculture; 
that some attention was being given to the subject in the normal 
schools of Illinois, Utah, and Oklahoma; that nothing was being 
done to furnish such training in the schools of Iowa, Kansas, 
Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Alabama, North Carolina, or 
New York, but that several of these schools were, however, 
getting ready to undertake the work as soon as possible. 
In a study of ninety-one state normal schools reported to the 
National Education Association in 1907, it was shown that 
seventy-five believed in an instruction in agriculture, and were 
either giving it in some form or desired to do so. Sixty-one of 
this number were either offering courses or had made plans for 
such courses for the following year. Seven of these were giving  
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
only a little agriculture in connection with other science courses. 
Eight were doing still more in connection with school gardens 
and were planning to extend the work. The remaining forty- 
six were giving definite courses in agriculture (64). 
During 1909-10 of one hundred and thirty-seven state normal 
schools, eighty-seven were giving some instruction in agriculture. 
In fifty-two of those offering courses, twenty-two made it 
elective and thirty required it. Of those not giving (instruction 
in agriculture, thirty-seven gave it incidentally in connection with 
botany, nature-study, or some other course in science, and nearly 
all those giving courses in agriculture also gave some attention 
to the subject in other science work, particularly in botany and 
nature-study. 
It will be seen from the above that normal schools are rapidly 
introducing agriculture. The number of schools offering such 
courses has increased from about 20 per cent in 1906 to more 
than 50 per cent in 1909. Indeed, the demand for well-qualified 
instructors in agriculture for normal schools exceeds the supply. 
One normal-school president says that he tried for over one year 
to secure a competent instructor. Davenport says: “The call is 
sharp from the normal schools of the Middle West which have 
this year (1909) taken some of the best trained and most 
promising teachers of this class” (65, p. 144). The call is not 
alone from the Middle West but the East as well. During the 
present school year one of the normal schools of the Atlantic 
Coast states secured a teacher who, at the time of his appointment, 
was professor of agricultural education in an agricultural college 
of the Middle West. 
Letters from presidents and others connected with normal 
schools not now (1910) offering agricultural instruction indicate 
that in many of these schools plans are under way to introduce the 
subject as soon as possible. Included in this number are the 
normal schools of New York and Pennsylvania, none of which 
now (1910) offers such instruction except incidentally with 
nature-study and other subjects.
-P-A-G-E-59
  STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS 51 
The character of the work in agriculture varies much in 
different schools. But there is one feature of the instruction 
that is common to all, viz., evidence of the newness of the 
subject and of the fact that it is in an experimental stage. In 
some schools the work in agriculture is only in name, much 
better instruction being given in other schools in courses in 
nature-study. 
The time given in the course of study varies from ten weeks 
to two full years, the average being less than one year. . One 
interesting reaction following the demands for agricultural in- 
struction is to be found in the readjustment in science courses, 
especially in the biological sciences. The title agricultural botany 
and agricultural zodlogy frequently occurs in courses of study. 
One fails to find in some of these, however, justification for 
the new titles, for the instruction remains much the same, 
with emphasis on morphology. The attitude of certain teach- 
ers of biology toward their subject is well illustrated by the 
following extract of a letter received from a member of the 
faculty of a large state normal school. “I obtained over one 
dozen kinds of water animals one day from a pool when the 
science (biology) teacher said he saw none in it. He was send- 
ing to New York City for crayfish when a brook near the building 
was full of them. The boys (in training school) had made nets 
and would have been glad to have caught the animals for him.” 
Perhaps the influence of such a teacher was partly responsible 
for the ignorance of a practice teacher (a senior) who stood in 
a bed of marigolds and asked if there were any marigolds in the 
garden. The introduction of agriculture will no doubt have 
much to do in changing this attitude. 
It will in the end exert a profound influence upon the teaching of 
general science. There is no manner of doubt that the masses of people 
are best benefited by the teaching of science in its applied form... .. 
Agriculture is evidently to be the pioneer in this business of the adaptation 
of science to the common affairs of life in the schools that are attended 
by the masses, and if this is true its incidental service may be even greater 
than its direct. In the meantime it is vastly significant that the schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
where teachers are made have at last commenced to study real life in one 
of its most concrete forms (65, pp. 45-46). 
Normal schools have so far been too much occupied in pro- 
viding for instruction in agriculture to give much attention to 
the pedagogical problems of the subject. These problems con- 
cern (a) the organization of courses in the normal school itself, 
and (b) methods of teaching the subject in the public schools. 
Naturally, the former has been the first to receive attention. The 
organization of work in agriculture has been in two directions, 
one in the science work already referred to, and the other in the 
purely agricultural courses recently introduced. 
Special efforts of adjustment have affected nature-study more 
than other science studies. Many believe that as far as the ele- 
mentary schools are concerned agriculture should have the nature- 
study aspect, or as some prefer to say, nature-study should have 
an agricultural trend; that since nature-study has to do with 
material drawn from the child’s immediate environment, and 
since a large part of this environment is more or less agricultural 
(consisting of animals and plants under control of man) a good 
course in nature-study forms an adequate preparation for a 
teacher to give such agricultural instruction as will meet the 
needs of rural schools, and at the same time enables a teacher to 
make use of school gardening and other practical or economic 
phases of the subject in city schools (66). 
The particular direction in which nature-study has been most 
modified in its readjustment has been in the school garden (67). 
It has been found that the school garden may serve as a very 
effectual means of unifying most all nature-study work. Chil- 
dren are not only able to “grow things” in gardens, but in doing 
this work successfully have had to solve many of the problems 
that are fundamental to agriculture. The character of the soil, 
the conservation of water by cultivation, the protection of plants 
from insect and other enemies, and many other factors of suc- 
cessful plant-growing are encountered. Many normal schools 
have regarded this readjustment of nature-study and other sci-
-P-A-G-E-61
  STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS 53 
ence work as sufficient to meet the demands for agricultural 
instruction in the training of elementary teachers, and are work- 
ing with this end in view. Some of the normal schools of Cali- 
fornia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and other states, and 
many of those schools now offering courses in agriculture, have 
made substantial progress in the readjustment of science work. 
Instruction in agriculture as a separate subject in normal 
schools is now in an experimental stage. Yet certain work and 
methods seem to have proved successful. The first publication 
of work adapted to normal schools was in the form of a textbook 
based on teaching experience in the Kirksville (Mo.) State 
Normal School (176). Recently a very concrete treatment of the 
problem has appeared as a government publication. It is an 
account of what is actually being done and how it is done in a 
typical normal school. The writer says in his introduction, 
The aim of the normal school is to prepare young men and women to 
teach in the elementary schools of the state. The young people who attend 
come from farms or smaller towns, and when they go out to teach they are 
called upon to give instruction in what is known as elementary agriculture. 
To meet this demand, a department of agriculture was established four 
years ago. The course at first extended through one term’s work but has 
been lengthened until practically two full years are now devoted to agri- 
cultural instruction. The work has attracted many young people, and the 
success with which they have subsequently instructed others along these 
lines indicate that the instruction has been effective. Not all the problems 
in teaching agriculture have been solved but it may justly be claimed that 
a few of the more difficult of them have been solved (68). 
Other similar publications of successful practice which have been 
tested by the work of students who have become teachers will 
contribute much toward the pedagogical efficiency of the subject. 
From the standpoint of methods of teaching the subject in 
the public school, little has been done. A very promising begin- 
ning of the study of this question was made at the Peru (Neb.) 
State Normal School in February, 1909, when the Normal Agri- 
cultural Society was organized. The purpose of this society is 
to aid teachers in “handling the new subject of agriculture in 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  54 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
public schools of the state.” Those interested in its organiza- 
tion have expressed the hope that “it will become a pedagogical 
laboratory for testing and discovering methods to improve and 
extend the teaching of agriculture throughout the schools of 
Nebraska.” The director is the head of the department of agri- 
culture in the Peru Normal School and conducts for the society 
a column in the Nebraska Farmer which is to be the official pub- 
lication of the society (69). 
An interesting experiment limited to one phase of agriculture 
is now being conducted at the Western Illinois State Normal 
School at Macomb in co-operation with the Illinois State Agri- 
cultural Experiment Station. A soil experiment field of two and 
one-half acres has been provided by the normal school. The 
school 
as its share of the responsibility, takes full charge of the field operations 
implied in the plans. Such co-operation provides for both scientific and 
educative values in the work and it is proposed to make the results as far 
reaching as possible. Not alone to teachers and prospective teachers will 
it be valuable but as well to persons now engaged in agricultural practice 
(70). 
A few helps to teachers have been worked out in normal 
schools and published, for example, from Cape Girardeau, Mo. 
(71), Los Angeles, Cal. (72), Greeley, Colo. (73), Hays, Kan. 
(74), and Chico, Cal. (75). They consist of discussion of agri- 
cultural subjects suitable for public schools, and methods of 
instruction. 
There is one large class of normal-school students already 
mentioned that is not adequately provided for. This class is 
made up of students who wish to teach in rural schools and who 
can spend only a year or part of a year in preparation, and is the 
largest in states where emphasis is placed on examination for 
certification. These students attend primarily to prepare for 
examinations. 
It has been the custom in most schools to provide for these 
students by offering short review courses. Often instruction in 
elementary agriculture and sometimes in manual training forms
-P-A-G-E-63

a part of this work, and is really the only part that takes into 
consideration the life of the community in which these students 
are to teach. These short courses are generally regarded by 
normal-school teachers as unsatisfactory, both on account of the 
shortness of the time given and the irregular preparation of the 
students themselves. Although the situation is recognized as a 
difficult one very little has been done to improve it. There are 
several schools, however, that have undertaken to give their 
students of this class some real preparation for this work as 
teachers. Some have arranged with local public-school authori- 
ties for a one-room rural school to be used as an observation or 
practice school. Others have built or have control of a one-room 
schoolhouse and have endeavored to make it a model of its kind 
so as to show concretely the possibilities of a rural school. For 
example, the Kirksville (Mo.) State Normal School has a well- 
appointed single-room schoolhouse. It has been 
designed and constructed to show that a rural school anywhere can have all 
the conveniences and comforts offered in any city building. The children 
are transported in covered vehicles to and from school. It is a model 
school so far as it can possibly be made such. It is to exemplify the best 
things which a school board and a good teacher with up-to-date facilities 
can do in and for a rural school. 
Special provision is made for instruction in manual training, 
elementary agriculture, and home economics.” 
Two somewhat similar plans for rural education should be 
mentioned in this connection. Both of these have the larger 
possibilities of teaching in rural communities in view. One is a 
course of two years called “rural arts” given by the Harris- 
burg (Va.) Normal and Industrial School for Women. The 
course requires high-school graduation for admission. The 
object is to 
give its students a training of mind, heart, and hand which will fit them 
for efficient service in rural schools, and for intelligent and appreciative 
participation in the life of rural communities. It will not attempt to train 
farmers; it cannot be expected to turn out agricultural experts. Its work

-P-A-G-E-64
  56 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
will be limited to those phases of farm life in which women usually, or 
frequently, or may properly participate, and to that portion of agricultural 
instruction which may properly be given by female teachers in elementary 
and high schools. 
The course includes besides some of the regular normal courses, 
horticulture, elementary agriculture, rural sociology, poultry- 
raising and bee culture, dairying, forestry and floriculture, and 
theory and practice in rural arts. The other is a course of two 
years known as “rural industrial education” given by the Ohio 
State Normal College of Miami University. Its requirements 
for admission are the same as for other college courses. This 
course is expected to meet the needs of township superintendents, 
principals, and science teachers of high schools in rural communi- 
ties, and to enable these teachers to adapt the work of their high 
schools more nearly to the life of the school communities. The 
course includes education, school administration, rural sociology, 
agriculture (two years), forestry, botany, manual training, rural 
education, methods of rural-school organization, physical geog- 
raphy, entomology, and physics of farm machinery. In plan- 
ning this course, which is at present a tentative one, the in- 
fluence of the high school of an agricultural community on 
the elementary schools was carefully considered. Most of the 
teachers in the elementary schools of these communities are 
graduates of these high schools. They seldom receive further 
training. Therefore, with a high school organized to meet the 
needs of the community, its influence should thus extend to the 
elementary schools through its graduates who become teachers 
(76). 
Any account of the work of the state normal schools in agri- 
cultural education would be incomplete without some special 
reference to the teachers themselves who are engaged in this 
work. Many are doing their work under considerable disad- 
vantage. This applies not only to the fact that agriculture is a 
new normal-school subject to be adapted to new conditions but 
3 Bulletin State Normal and Industrial School, Harrisburg, Va., 1, No. 1 (1909), 88-02.
-P-A-G-E-65
  STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS 57 
also to the fact that it has been added as an additional subject to 
a teacher’s already overcrowded program. One teacher writes 
that he is offering agriculture this year for the first time, but is 
expected also to teach physics, chemistry, botany, zodlogy, physi- 
ology, geology, and physical geography. Several teachers have 
bought small farms primarily in order that their students might 
have the advantage of actual field experimentation. 
With the earnest body of teachers now beginning to take up 
the work and with the progress already made it seems likely that 
the demands for agricultural instruction in the training of teach- 
ers in state normal schools will soon be met. The real test of 
the value of this training is in the work of the teacher who goes 
out from the schools and it is now too early to pass judgment.

  CHAPTER VII 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION—STATE AND OTHER 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS 
It is said of the National Education Association that it “has 
been, and is now the body-guard of public-school instruction in 
our country.” While this statement may not be taken literally, the 
fact remains that this Association is the one educational organi- 
zation which is truly national in character, embracing as it does 
the interests of all parts of the country and all phases of educa- 
tion. 
It was organized in Philadelphia on August 26, 1857, under 
the name of the National Teachers’ Association by a group of 
teachers who met in response to a call sent out the previous year 
to all the local teachers’ associations. The call itself is significant, 
for it expresses the spirit which has, on the whole, been manifest 
during the entire existence of the Association: to teachers of 
the United States “who are willing to unite in a general effort 
to promote the general welfare of our country by concentrating 
the wisdom and power of numerous minds, and by distributing 
among all the accumulated experiences of all” (77). 
The name was changed in 1870 to the National Educa- 
tional Association and in 1907 to the one it now bears. As it was 
founded to meet the demands of a natural growth, it has never 
departed from the essential principles on which it was founded. 
The extent to which the “accumulated experiences of all” have 
been “distributed among all” may be seen by a reference to the 
published list of titles of papers and discussions from 1857 to 
1907. This list covers over seventy pages and embraces almost 
every imaginable subject of educational interest (78). Many 
discussions are of only passing importance; some are but means 
of exploiting favorite theories; others are real contributions to 
educational thought.

STATE AND OTHER TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS 59 
Beyond the propaganda which is expected of any large 
educational body the most valuable work of the Association 
has been through its committees which have been appointed 
from time to time to investigate and report upon various im- 
portant questions of general interest. 
The Association being a sort of clearing-house for educa- 
tional ideas, its published Proceedings provide a valuable source 
of information concerning all kinds of tendencies and move- 
ments in education. Agricultural education has received a share 
of attention proportional to the different stages of its develop- 
ment. The interest of the Association in this subject as re- 
flected in the Proceedings extends over four periods: the first 
from 1857 to 1897, the second from 1897 to 1903, the third 
from 1903 to 1906, and the fourth from 1906 to the present 
time. 
Agriculture was not considered as a separate subject except 
as referring to agricultural colleges until the latter part of the 
first period. Industrial education, however, was discussed as 
early as 1866. In 1875 a Department of Industrial Education 
was formed. At this meeting the question: “Can Elements of 
Industrial Education Be Introduced into Our Common Schools?” 
was discussed in a paper by John D. Philbrook. He said: 
“Science and art with reference to their special application to 
industrial pursuits must be included in the modern school course.” 
Drawing, geometry, natural history, physics, and chemistry were 
mentioned as the branches which lie at the foundation of indus- 
trial education. 
At the meeting of the following year (1876) William T. 
Harris in his report as chairman of the committee on “Course of 
Study from Primary School to University” refers to the diffi- 
culty of deciding “the amount of prominence to be given to 
industrial branches in comparison with those chiefly productive 
of theoretical culture.” He says also: “The primary school has 
been called upon to fit for life.” In the course of study reported 
by the committee for the district schools, topics relating to nature 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
are suggested as follows: “Inorganic—arithmetic, oral lessons 
in natural philosophy; organic—geography, oral lessons in 
natural history.” 
These two references to the early discussions of industrial 
education are given to show that the need of such instruction 
was being considered at this time, and from a somewhat general 
viewpoint which might include agriculture although it was not 
specifically mentioned. The Department of Industrial Education, 
however, gave its attention almost wholly to urban conditions. 
Drawing and manual training held prominent places in the dis- 
cussions of all the meetings. In 1890 the name of the Depart- 
ment was very properly changed to Industrial and Manual 
Training, and in 1899 to Manual Training. 
In 1893, at the International Congress of Education held 
under the auspices of the Association, agriculture had a place 
on the program (79) but the paper was read by a Russian. 
Perhaps his account of the use of agriculture in the rural 
schools as a school subject had something to do with direct- 
ing the attention of the Association to the rural-school prob- 
lem. At any rate, at the meeting of 1895 a committee of 
twelve was appointed to investigate and report upon rural 
schools as to maintenance, supervision, supply of teachers, and 
instruction and discipline. 
The report was submitted to the meeting of 1897. It con- 
tains a number of suggestions which involve more or less agri- 
cultural instruction such as surface features of the earth includ- 
ing soils, weather, plant and animal life, etc. It also emphasizes 
the need of a course of study “framed with direct reference to 
actual conditions that prevail in country life and in large measure 
determine it. Among the most important points to be kept in 
mind are the following: (1) There is a general lack of apprecia- 
tion of immediate surroundings; (2) there is an almost total 
lack of scientific skill in farm work; (3) in the country there is 
a great dearth of social life.” Under (2) certain phases of 
mechanics, manual training, biology, meteorology and physics
-P-A-G-E-69
STATE AND OTHER TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS 61 
of the atmosphere, mineralogy, and chemistry were included. 
Another portion of the report is devoted to the “farm as the 
center of interest,” and a great many things which we now find 
in all textbooks on elementary agriculture are mentioned (80). 
During the latter part of the second period (1897-1903) 
agriculture appeared as a topic for discussion at nearly every 
meeting. At the meeting of 1902 five papers were read as 
follows: “The Value of a Large Agricultural School in Indian 
Service” ; “Correlation of Schoolroom and Farm Work”; “The 
Education of the American Farmer”; “The Practical Value of 
Teaching Agriculture in the Public Schools”; “The Teaching of 
Agriculture with Reference to Future Employment.” 
In 1903 a committee on “Industrial Education in Schools for 
Rural Communities” was appointed. The committee made its 
report at the meeting of 1905 and represents the most important 
contribution of the Association to agricultural education in the 
third period (1903-6). A considerable part of the report deals 
with agricultural subjects and their adaptation to elementary 
and secondary rural schools. Among the recommendations of the 
committee are the following: “A modification of the course of 
study should be made for the introduction of work, especially 
in the elements of agriculture and domestic science, and such 
further lines of industrial education as local conditions make 
feasible. ... . The establishment of schools distinctly indus- 
trial (agricultural high schools) in their character is absolutely 
necessary for the proper development and organization of the 
rural-school system.” 
A detailed course of study for all the grades is submitted. 
It is an interesting contrast to the course of study reported by 
the Committee of Twelve of 1897. In the latter the idea that 
agricultural subjects should receive attention in the rural schools 
is suggested rather than definitely stated and outlined. In the 
former this idea is expressed in a definite and concrete outline 
with illustrative lessons. 
The work in agriculture for the secondary schools is particu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
larly well outlined, and illustrated by accounts of work actually 
carried on in two existing agricultural high schools: one the 
Dunn County (Wisconsin) School of Agriculture and Domestic 
Economy; the other, the Minnesota Agricultural High School 
connected with the Agricultural College of Minnesota (81). 
The fourth period is characterized by a more active interest 
in agricultural education. Three important steps were taken: 
(a) continuation of Committee on Industrial Education in 
Schools for Rural Communities; (6) formation of National 
Committee on Agricultural Education; (c) organization of a 
Department of Rural and Agricultural Education. 
The Committee on Industrial Education in Schools for 
Rural Communities made two reports, one at the meeting of the 
Association in 1907 and the other at the meeting of 1908. 
In some preliminary investigation for the supplementary 
report the correspondence showed that “what was most wanted 
was a definite statement of what was actually being done in 
different parts of the country in providing facilities for industrial 
education in rural communities.” The supplementary report 
represents the efforts of the committee to satisfy this demand. 
It consists of three parts: a discussion of the general problem, 
including school buildings, school gardens, manual training, na- 
tionalizing the work (referring to the Davis bill then before 
Congress) and in what schools agriculture should be taught; 
industrial work in New England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
and New York; experiences and opinions of individual teachers 
in the preceding territory (82). 
The second report (1908) is limited to “a presentation of 
what is being done in schools representing four types of organi- 
zation, as showing the possibilities in other schools of these types 
and the conditions under which these possibilities may become 
actualities.” The schools selected and reported upon are the 
Waterford High School, at Waterford, Pa., the Cecil County 
High School, at Calvert, Md., the John Swaney Consolidated 
School, in Magnolia Township, Putnam County, IIl., and the
-P-A-G-E-71
STATE AND OTHER TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS 63 
congressional district agricultural schools located at Americus 
and Monroe, Ga. Each type is described in sufficient detail to 
give a clear understanding of its organization and actual work. 
The final conclusions of the Committee are summed up in 
nine paragraphs, two of which should be quoted here since they 
refer to conditions that continue to exist: 
That the supply of properly trained teachers for carrying on this work 
is totally inadequate to meet even the present demand, and that the increase 
in the demand for such teachers in the near future requires a very large 
increase in the facilities for their preparation, and to supply these facilities 
special training schools should be established throughout the country for 
the preparation of elementary rural-school teachers; that the normal schools 
whose graduates find positions in rural schools should broaden and strengthen 
in every way their courses of instruction along industrial lines adapted to 
the needs of rural schools; that the agricultural colleges favorably situated 
for such work should undertake to organize special courses for the purpose 
of training teachers for the secondary schools, capable of giving instruction 
in agriculture and related subjects. 
That in the growth of public sentiment, in the development of ideals, in 
the preparation of courses of study, and in the facilities for the training of 
teachers for industrial work in rural schools, decided progress has been 
made in recent years; but that much yet remains to be done before the 
importance and value of this kind of industrial education shall be fully 
appreciated by all concerned, and before it shall receive its appropriate 
recognition and find its proper place in our educational system (83). 
In 1906 a call was sent out to members of the Association 
who were interested in agricultural education to be present at 
the annual meeting of the Department of Superintendence for 
the purpose of discussing various problems concerning this sub- 
ject. There was an encouraging response and an interesting 
meeting was held. At this meeting the National Committee on 
Agricultural Education was formed. 
The second conference of this committee was held at the meet- 
ing of the Association of 1907. At this session three important 
papers were read and discussed: “The Work of the National 
Government in Extending Agricultural Education through the 
Public Schools” ; “What Has Been Done and Is Being Done by 
   
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Normal Schools and Agricultural Schools for Popular Education 
in Agriculture” (84); “The Work in Agriculture as Conducted 
by State and County Organizations of Young People in Club 
Contests.” The third conference of the committee was held at 
the meeting of the Department of Superintendence held at Wash- 
ington in 1908. Just at this time the Davis bill (28) and the 
Burkett bill (28) were being considered as separate measures. 
Under the direction of the National Committee on Agricultural 
Education a conference was held with all parties interested in the 
two measures, resulting in the introduction in Congress of a 
new bill embodying the essential features of the two separate 
ones. A subcommittee conferred with the President of the 
United States, and also with the Senate Committee on Agri- 
culture in behalf of national aid for agricultural instruction. 
The fourth, fifth, and sixth conferences of the committee were 
held at the meetings of the Department of Superintendence of 
1909, 1910, and 1911. At the fourth session two committees 
were appointed, and reports were made at the fifth session. 
These were on “Credit Value of High-School Agriculture for 
College Entrance” and “The Course of Study in Agriculture 
—What Shall It Be?” Considerable attention was given at 
each of these meetings to federal aid measures (Davis bill, 
Dolliver bill, Page bill) before Congress. 
At the nineteenth annual convention (1905) of the Associa- 
tion of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, 
K. L. Butterfield introduced the following resolution: 
Wuereas, This Association believes that the questions involved in the 
general and technical education of the rural people are of sufficient impor- 
tance to warrant special recognition in the great gatherings of American edu- 
cators: Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That our executive committee be hereby instructed to takesuch — 
steps as it may consider necessary in an endeavor to secure the consent of the 
National Education Association to add to its list of special departments a de- 
partment or departments of rural and agricultural education (85, p. 28). 
This resolution was adopted by the Association and D. J. 
Crosby was delegated to bring the matter before the National
-P-A-G-E-73
  STATE AND OTHER TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS 65 
Education Association (85, p. 47). As there was no meeting 
of this Association in 1906, the application was deferred until 
the Los Angeles meeting of 1907, when on July 8, Mr. Crosby 
presented the following: 
In view of the widespread and active interest in the improvement of rural 
schools and in the development and extension of instruction in agriculture and 
the allied subjects of nature-study and school gardening in the colleges and 
public schools of the country, and in view of the fact that there is no national 
organization of teachers for discussion of rational methods of instruction in 
these subjects, the undersigned active members of the National Education 
Association respectfully request permission to form a Department of Rural 
and Agricultural Education co-ordinate with the other regularly constituted 
departments of this Association (followed by signatures of twenty-eight active 
members). 
This petition was received and authority was granted to 
form such a department (82, pp. 44-45). The department was 
organized at the Los Angeles meeting, but owing to some irregu- 
larity in the proceedings it was not officially recognized. The 
official organization of the department took place at Washington, 
D.C., February 27, 1908, during the 1908 meeting of the De- 
partment of Superintendence (83, p. 136). 
Four regular meetings of the Department of Rural and Agri- 
cultural Education have been held (in 1908, 1909, 1910, and 
1gt1). As they are fully reported in the Proceedings of the 
Association no further reference need be made here, except 
to state that they were well attended and much interest was shown 
in the discussions. 
It will be seen from the foregoing account that the National 
Education Association has been and is an important factor in 
agricultural education, first in the way of propaganda, by bring- 
ing the subject prominently before the teachers of the entire 
country, and second by real constructive work through its com- 
mittees and its Department of Rural and Agricultural Education. 
Through the published Proceedings of the Association the 
development of the movement for agricultural education can be 
followed as in no other educational literature excepting that of
-P-A-G-E-74
    
66 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the National Government through its publications of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and of the Bureau of Education. 
STATE AND INTERSTATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS 
There are about seventy of these associations. Some were in 
existence long before the organization of the National Teachers’ 
Association. Most of them publish proceedings of their meet- 
ings, but for lack of funds and other causes accounts of these 
meetings are not always published except in local papers. 
Enough of these proceedings, however, are available in published 
form to trace any educational movement as reflected by the dis- 
cussions of these meetings. One finds that agricultural education 
began to receive attention from these associations about the 
same time that the National Education Association became 
actively interested in it. We find, for example, the Alabama 
Educational Association in 1905 devoting a considerable part of 
its program to the subject, and calling W. M. Hays to give an 
address; the California State Teachers’ Association in 1905 
holding joint sessions with the State Farmers’ Institute, and call- 
ing L. D. Harvey and A. C. True to make addresses ; the Georgia 
Teachers’ Association in its meetings of 1903, 1906, 1907, and 
1908 giving prominence to the subject, in 1908 holding a con- 
ference with representative business men from forty-four of 
the fifty counties of the state concerning the district agricultural 
high schools. These illustrations are typical of the consideration 
given agricultural education by most of these associations at 
their recent meetings. Their contribution consists chiefly in 
creating an interest in the subject. Sometimes, however, move- 
ments are started that result in state legislation. 
It is not possible in the limits of this chapter to enter into 
further discussion of the work of these associations, instructive 
as it might be to follow carefully the development of agricultural 
education as expressed by these bodies of teachers in various 
sections of the country.

CHAPTER VIII 
EDUCATIONAL PERIODICALS 
The number of educational periodicals published in the 
United States probably exceeds that on any other subject. Most 
of these publications are in the library of the United States 
Bureau of Education. In 1906 they numbered one hundred and 
fifty-six (86). 
For purposes of classification the periodicals included in this 
number may be considered fairly representative of all such pub- 
lications in the United States. They naturally fall into three 
groups: (1) general, including those devoted to subjects of 
general interest or to various general problems in education, and 
whose circulation is not limited to any particular section of the 
country or class of readers; (2) special, including those devoted 
to some single phase of education, as, for example, orthography, 
penmanship, phonetics, geography, school art, manual training, 
science, etc.; (3) local, including those whose main circulation is 
confined to a single state or group of states. 
The bibliography alone of contributions and references to 
agricultural education in these periodicals would occupy several 
times the space allotted to a single chapter of this book. It 
will therefore be necessary to confine the discussion of this sub- 
ject, as represented in various educational periodicals, to some 
references of historical interest in Barnard’s Journal of Educa- 
tion, and to a brief account of each of the above three groups. 
No investigation of an educational movement would be com- 
plete without consulting Barnard’s Journal of Education. 
“Wherever libraries of education are now gathered his encyclo- 
pedic journal has a place of honor. Whoever will found such a 
library must look first to secure a set of this great work. Because 
he saw so far, the contents of that great work will not soon grow 
out of date” (87). In this work are many references to agri- 
67
-P-A-G-E-76
  68 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
cultural education. Three are worthy of special interest: early 
agricultural schools; agriculture in schools for homeless children 
and in schools for delinquent children; and agricultural educa- 
tion in foreign countries. 
An account is given of probably the first agricultural school in 
the United States. It was founded in 1797 at Lethe, S.C., by Dr. 
John de la Howe. He left a will which provided for the endow- 
ment of “an agricultural or farm school in conformity, as near 
as can be, to a plan proposed in the Columbian Magazine for the 
month of April, 1787, for educating, boarding, and clothing 
twelve poor boys and twelve poor girls of the Abbeville District.” 
The endowment consisted of 500 acres of farm land and 1,000 
acres of forest (88). 
An account of another early school is of interest because it 
anticipated some of the present notions of industrial education. 
The following is a quotation from a letter of a Mr. Coe to the 
son of Josiah Holbrook, the founder of the school: 
He [Josiah Holbrook] had long cherished the idea of endeavoring to 
found an institution in which the course of instruction should be plain and 
practical; an agricultural school, where the science of chemistry and me- 
chanics and land surveying should be thoroughly drilled into the minds 
of the pupils by practice. With these views the agricultural seminary was 
commenced in Derby (Conn.) in 1824, and continued to the fall of 1825, 
under the direction of your father and myself; and, as far as I know, was 
the first educational movement of the kind in all that region..... We 
did what we could to train the students in the analysis of soils and in the 
application of the mechanical powers to all farming operations, and took 
out our young men often into the field and country for practical survey- 
ing, geological excursions, road making, and the labors of the farm; but 
not being able at that time to place the school on an eligible foundation, it 
was abandoned (89). 
Josiah Holbrook after giving up his school turned his atten- 
tion to adult instruction which was somewhat like our present 
agricultural extension among farmers. 
Our present organization of agricultural colleges is very 
similar to a plan for such schools proposed in Barnard’s Journal 
of Education in 1856 by Professor John A. Porter of Yale. 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
EDUCATIONAL PERIODICALS 69 
This was the year after the act establishing the first agricultural 
college (Michigan) was passed and the year before it was 
formally opened. He deplored the lack of agricultural instruc- 
tion in this country and suggested that such instruction might 
be supplied by having a demonstration farm, an experiment farm, 
and means of instruction in all sciences connected with culture 
of the soil. He says: 
What a center of light would such a school as here described be to 
the whole agricultural community. All purported discoveries in agriculture 
would come to be tested, and important truths developed by experiment 
would go forth from it into the world..... Through its pupils it would 
disseminate widely the varied practical information which its courses would 
furnish, and beyond this, it might be made a means of eliciting the experi- 
mental labor of hundreds of intelligent farmers throughout the country, 
for the decision of the important agricultural questions which are still un- 
settled (88). 
In a footnote at the end of the article the editor calls atten- 
tion to an account in his National Education in Europe of the 
system of agricultural education established in France as it was 
in 1854, and also to the Institute of Agriculture and Forestry in 
Wiirtemburg, and the system of agricultural education in Ireland. 
Pestalozzi and his work, particularly his influence on our own 
school practices, receive much consideration in the journal under 
discussion. For example, we find the historical beginning of 
nature-study in this country in the object-teaching at Oswego. 
This attempt to put his doctrine into practice is described in 
great detail (89a). In another place Pestalozzi is quoted as say- 
ing with reference to objective teaching that “agricultural labor 
offers a wider field than any other employment for this means.” 
This statement should be contrasted with the absurd efforts made 
in some schools to apply these principles. It would be interest- 
ing in this connection to trace the influence of these early object- 
lessons on nature-study teaching and to discover to what extent 
it is responsible for the struggle which nature-study has had to 
find a legitimate place in our schools. 
The agricultural school of De Fellenburg and Wehrli was a
-P-A-G-E-78
  7° AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
school for the poor at Hopwyl, and many of the pupils were 
juvenile offenders of various sorts (90). Several Fellenburg 
schools were established in this country in the early part of the 
last century. The Journal brought the work of these schools in 
this country and in Europe into notice again. About the same 
time there seems to have been a revival of these methods in 
certain schools and institutions in this country. Practically all 
of the reform schools for boys in the United States are now 
provided with farms, and agriculture is an important part of 
their work. How much influence, if any, the Journal had in 
bringing this about we do not know. But we find it giving, on 
the one hand, details of such work as in the agricultural school 
just referred to, and on the other, accounts and discussions of 
reform schools and institutions for homeless children in this 
country (91). 
Education in foreign countries occupied a prominent place 
in the J oneal From time to time accounts of agricultural 
education in various countries appeared. A good example of 
these accounts is to be found in one devoted to agricultural edu- 
cation in France and about twenty different parts of the world. 
This is a part of an exhaustive study of scientific instruction 
applied to national industries in different countries (92). 
The first group of educational periodicals—those mainly de- 
voted to general problems of education or to publication of educa- 
tional research—is quite small in number compared with the other 
two groups. Their circulation is also much less than most of those 
of the third group. Notwithstanding their small number and 
limited circulation these periodicals contain some of our most 
valuable educational literature, and are, on the whole, a source 
of high authority in educational matters. The attention given 
to ainclete education is much less than would seem to be 
warranted in view of the great public interest in the subject and 
of the fact of its rapid introduction into schools of various sec- 
tions of the country. Compared with other sources the litera- 
ture on this subject as found in the leading periodicals of this
-P-A-G-E-79
  EDUCATIONAL PERIODICALS ou 
group is very meager (Barnard’s Journal excepted). A few of 
the earlier articles discuss how agricultural education might be 
gradually developed in the elementary and secondary schools. 
Some work of an extension character was regarded at that time 
(1900--1901 ) as the most feasible and practicable, nature-study, 
reading courses, itinerant schools, and short courses being sug- 
gested as the best means of creating an interest in the subject 
(93, 94). 
A little later the place of agriculture in our public-school 
system is carefully considered with conclusions favorable to its 
introduction (95). In the meantime the subject is being rapidly 
introduced in our schools, and certain tendencies are arising that 
are viewed with some alarm because they are not in harmony 
with the national policy in school matters. An editorial in one 
periodical calls attention to some of the dangers arising from the 
establishment of agricultural high schools : 
If the new type of work means the establishment of a separate system 
of high schools, the existing high schools will be sapped of the very means 
of their existence... .. There is one other and more urgent reason why 
a separate class of high schools must not be allowed to spring up. Just 
as sure as they do they will breed social distinctions and cause stratifications 
in society. It has been our boast that children of all nationalities, occupa- 
tions, and creeds enter our schoolroom doors and emerge together as 
American citizens. The American public school is the greatest factor in 
developing American citizenship that we possess, and its function in de- 
veloping American citizenship is greater than teaching arithmetic, Latin, 
or trades. Social efficiency is much more needed just now than business 
efficiency. But alas, too many are thinking only of business acumen. ... . 
The one who argues for the establishment of a separate system of agri- 
cultural high schools or separate industrial high schools is wittingly or un- 
wittingly an enemy to our present high schools and to true democracy (96, 
PP. 57-59). 
The implication in this editorial that existing high schools 
furnish all that is really needed in secondary education is open to 
question, and soon brings a rejoinder : 
I am afraid that the distinctions are here or have got to come, and 
that the high schools which are nothing more than college preparatory  
-P-A-G-E-80
     AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
  72 
schools will have to sink into relative insignificance compared with schools 
which will teach the masses how to make a living as well as how to live. 
wien We need as never before many-sided men and women, but men and 
women who will put how to live and how to make a living first, and how 
to use one’s mT second (97, p. 199). 
At present the importance of the problem suggested in the 
foregoing discussion is being appreciated, and all the more 
because agricultural high schools continue to be established. 
Besides general discussions of the whole question of industrial 
education as related to elementary and secondary schools two 
plans for agricultural education in existing high schools are pro- 
posed and are being considered. For example, one writer believes 
in the correlation of high-school science and agriculture and gives 
numerous illustrations to show that “the benefit of correlation 
inures as well to the fundamental sciences as to their application 
in agriculture” (98). Another thinks that agriculture should 
be taught as a separate science. He says: 
“Educators are coming to see more and more clearly that 
agriculture is both a science and an art, and as a result it is being 
taught in ways which are not strictly applicable to the teaching 
of other sciences.” He sums up fifty-six replies to a question- 
naire sent out to secondary-school men and college professors 
and concludes that a “majority who have had actual experience 
in teaching the subject advocate its being taught separately” (99). 
Among the periodicals of the second group two are devoted 
to special phases of education that include agriculture. One is 
School Science and Mathematics and the other is the Nature- 
Study Review. The former is published in the interest of sec- 
ondary education and the latter of elementary education. The 
editors and associate editors of both periodicals are well-known 
schoolmen who are actively interested in the various problems 
of education of their own special lines of work. 
In a recent number of School Science and Mathematics we 
find among the introductory sentences of an article on biologic 
science in secondary schools the following:     
-P-A-G-E-81
  EDUCATIONAL PERIODICALS 73 
This is pre-eminently an age of applied science; it is an intensely practi- 
cal age; the average individual comes in daily contact with problems of 
science as never before. It is self-evident that science work in elementary 
schools should play an important part in the education of our youth who 
go into life—as a vast majority do—with no further fitting than that re- 
ceived in the elementary school or secondary school. It was with this 
thought in mind that the writer began the following preliminary investi- 
gation which aims in the first place to present some statistics bearing upon 
the teaching of science, and especially of biologic science, in the secondary 
schools, and in the second place to suggest possible modifications in our 
present courses in biologic science that will make such courses a better 
preparation for the kind of life into which most of our young people are 
launching, the active life of the thinking, doing citizen (100). 
This somewhat lengthy quotation with respect to one secondary- 
school subject is given because it represents very well the 
general attitude of the recent contributors to this journal. Agri- 
culture is closely allied to all of the fundamental sciences and any 
such modifications of science teaching as indicated in the above 
reference will have an important bearing on agricultural educa- 
tion in the secondary schools. These contributors are already 
teaching particular branches of science, and their writings have 
to do with their own subjects in relation to agriculture rather 
than with agriculture as a separate subject. 
The general field covered by the Nature-Study Review in- 
cludes, as is stated in the introduction to the first number, “school 
gardening and the closely allied elementary agriculture” (ror). 
This magazine is now in its seventh volume and has published 
numerous articles on agriculture as adapted to the elementary 
schools. For awhile, from September to December, 1909, a 
special department of school agriculture was conducted. But it 
was abandoned, the policy now being to devote certain numbers 
exclusively to this subject, as in the May number of Vol. VI.1 
The third group includes about one hundred periodicals in 
which every section of the country is represented. It is through 
these that the masses of the teachers are reached. In many states 
* Another periodical perhaps should be included: School Agriculture, “a semi-monthly 
text for use in country, town, and city schools, homes and clubs,” published by The Orange 
Judd Co., beginning January 1, 1911.

74 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
| 
some educational periodical becomes a sort of official organ 
for the state department of education. Practically all whose 
subscribers are teachers in the rural schools give considerable 
attention to agriculture, mainly in the way of suggestions and 
helps to teachers. The effect of these periodicals on the actual 
teaching of agriculture in the public schools has been, up to the 
present, far greater than of any of the first or second group. 
One periodical, the School News (Illinois), has been referred to 
in a previous chapter (58). It was one of the first to 
take up elementary agriculture in response to the new demand 
upon the rural teachers. In 1900 it began to publish short 
articles on various phases of agriculture adapted to the ele- 
mentary schools. The practical efforts of this magazine to help 
the rural teachers is further shown in connection with the new 
course of study for the state of Illinois. This course includes 
agriculture. The department of the magazine devoted to school 
work in agriculture expands the course of study in agriculture 
into descriptive details and gives specific directions to teachers 
as to how to present the new work (102). 
The Nebraska Teacher, besides publishing special articles on 
various phases of agriculture, is now publishing a series of 
articles by Superintendent E. C. Bishop on “Agriculture and 
Home Economics” (103). These articles are intended to assist 
teachers in their work with the boys’ and girls’ clubs of the state. 
Many similar examples might be given but these two are 
typical of the work that is now being done by many if not most 
of the periodicals of the third group. They are close to the 
teachers and seem to know what they need, or at least what they 
want, and give it to them in a simple and concrete way.

CHAPTER IX 
PERIODICAL LITERATURE 
Popular periodicals have become an important factor in 
education. They reach thousands of people. Several have a 
circulation of more than 100,000, and a few claim to reach a 
million readers. Every subject of popular interest is exploited. 
This popular interest determines in a large measure the choice 
of subject-matter, but not always. Interest in new things 
is often stimulated by well-written articles. Indeed there is a 
keen search for new things or the beginnings of new move- 
ments that may seem to have elements of popular interest. 
The importance of rural education, the inefficiency of the pres- 
ent system, and the need of redirecting rural education are 
new things from the standpoint of the popular periodical. 
An educational system which originated in pioneer days, 
and which served its purpose well in those days, persists today 
with less modification than has taken place in any other fea- 
ture of rural life. The few changes that have taken place were 
brought about largely through imitation, either voluntarily or 
impressed by law, of urban schools, and were not the changes 
of an adaptive growth. This static condition of rural educa- 
tion was until a few years ago, and is, in most communities at 
the present time, looked upon with complacency and satisfac- 
tion. Patrons who were not satisfied quietly moved to some 
town or city where their children might have better educational 
advantages, but little or no criticism of the rural school was 
ventured and little or no effort made to improve it. 
With this situation in mind, it is easy to see why any 
departure from the established routine in rural-school manage- 
ment or any effort to make its work better adapted to rural 
conditions would be regarded by editors of popular periodicals 
as something new and worthy of wide publicity.

  76 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Consolidation of rural schools began in the early nineties. 
Various periodicals gave accounts of the schools of Kingsville 
Township, Ohio, which in 1892 instituted a plan of consoli- 
dation for rural schools. This movement soon attracted much 
attention, and many visits were made to Ohio for the pur- 
pose of seeing the plan in actual operation. In a few years the 
plan was not only extended to other parts of Ohio but was 
introduced in many other states. It has worked so successfully 
as to be considered one of the most important features of any 
general scheme for improving rural schools. 
The work of Kingsville Township was not the historical 
beginning of the consolidated-school movement, but it was the 
potential. beginning, largely due to the public notice it received 
through newspapers and periodicals. 
Superintendent O. J. Kern, of Winnebago County, IIL, had 
barely demonstrated the success of his Farmer Boys’ Experi- 
ment Club which he had organized in February, 1902, among 
the schoolboys of his county, when he was asked to give an 
account of it in one of our leading popular magazines. This 
work of his was something new in a county system of schools, 
and furthermore it had begun at once to interest farmers and 
to change their attitude toward the rural schools. Winnebago 
County was a typical county with large agricultural interests. 
Its problems and interests were like those of hundreds of other 
counties. Superintendent Kern had found something that looked 
toward making the school life of the country boys more worth 
while, but he had much more in mind than his Boys’ Experiment 
Club. He believed that the whole rural-school system needed 
readjustment and that it might be slowly brought about. 
Here was a chance for the magazine to be of service by 
giving publicity to successful work, and for the writer to get 
others interested in his plans, and to get them to work along 
similar lines. The article appeared under the title of “Learn- 
ing by Doing for the Farmer Boy” and was illustrated by five 
good pictures with the “boy” prominently in the foreground of 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  PERIODICAL LITERATURE 17 
each. The title and the pictures were attractive and were likely 
to cause the reader to pause in turning through the pages of the 
magazine long enough at least to read the introductory para- 
graph. This was an expression of an ideal for rural education 
which up to that time (1903) had not come much into public 
notice: 
It is not the belief or wish of the writer that we should educate country 
boys to be farmers merely, any more than that we should educate boys to 
be blacksmiths, carpenters, or electricians. We should aim to train boys to 
be men in the highest sense of the term. But why not a course of training 
in the country school for the country boy which shall teach him more about 
country life around him? Along with his study of the kangaroo, the 
bamboo, and the cockatoo, why not study the animals on the farm and a 
proper feeding-standard for them, the care and composition of the soil on 
the farm, the improvement of types of grains and vegetables, and the pro- 
tection of birds beneficial to the farmer? Instead of all the boys’ arith- 
metic being devoted to problems, more or less theoretical, on banking, stocks, 
exchange, brokerage, alligation, and partnership, why not some practical 
problems with reference to farm economics? For the boys who will remain 
on the farm (and 85 per cent perhaps will) the course of instruction should 
be such as will be an inspiration and a help in their future life-work (104). 
A year later under the title of “Common-Sense Country 
Schools” a description of Mr. Kern’s work appeared in another 
magazine (105). Other references to his work have been pub- 
lished from time to time. 
Boys’ clubs for carrying on agricultural experiments have 
been organized in all of the agricultural states. Accounts of 
their work are attractive reading, and no doubt not only stimu- 
late the boys in other localities to form similar clubs but help 
to educate adult farmers to be more appreciative of expert 
opinion. But the most important contribution made by periodi- 
cals to agricultural education through boys’ clubs has been in 
making the way easier for agricultural colleges and public-school 
officers to carry on the work in various parts of the country. 
In the same number of the magazine in which Mr. Kern’s 
article appeared is another dealing with the problem of rural 
education (106). The need of a school system adapted to rural
-P-A-G-E-86
  78 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
conditions is set forth. Special emphasis is placed upon the 
value of agricultural high schools and of consolidated rural 
schools. At that time there were twelve agricultural high 
schools in the United States; in 1910 over seventy-five. 
Another account of important work in agricultural educa- 
tion was published in the same year (1903) with the title 
“Teaching Farmers’ Children on the Ground” (107). It is of 
interest to compare the opinion of Superintendent Kern as to 
the needs of the rural school with that of the writer of this 
article who was not professionally engaged in education. The 
following is taken from his description of a rural school: 
But there is more the matter with the ordinary country school than its 
smallness of scale... .. Yet that these children come from homes where 
the livelihood is earned out of the ground is ignored in the lessons. The 
instruction as far as it goes is good: it is staple reading, writing, and arith- 
metic, with a little grammar, geography, and history. This is all. It might 
do well enough if the boys and girls were all going to be clerks or traders; 
or if, in the fulness of their ambition, they were to strike out for profes- 
sional careers. But of sowing and reaping there is never a word; nothing 
about planting and tending of trees, the production of milk, butter, and 
cheese. Never, even remotely, does a lesson touch on building and drain- 
age, on the composition of foods or chemistry of fuel, or light up for so 
much as a moment the drama of struggle and survival of which every 
clover patch is a theater. It is well that children should learn at school 
useful lessons they can learn nowhere else, but should not the children 
of the farm be led to see somewhat of the inexhaustible scope for brains 
which offers itself to the farmer? The fact is, that rural instruction has 
been largely devised in cities with a view to city conditions. And the 
courses in city schools are faulty enough, ridden as they are by clerky tra- 
ditions which permit the word to usurp the place of the act, instead of 
being merely its symbol and aid. The second evil in rural education 
throughout America is the stress laid upon verbal studies, the blinking of the 
actual world of duty and joy for which country children should be in- 
formed and trained. 
This is followed by a description of the proposed scheme for 
the improvement of rural education in Canada planned on a 
scale to include the whole Dominion. Not only is this descrip- 
tion accurate but it includes a good historical and economic
-P-A-G-E-87
PERIODICAL LITERATURE 79 
background. This account of the “Macdonald Movement” 
before it was carried out in actual practice prepared the public 
mind for the numerous reports of the work that have appeared 
since. 
Mention should be made of one more popular article on rural 
education appearing in |1903, entitled “Farmer Children Need 
Farmer Studies” (108). The title indicates the general nature 
of the discussion. That the writer is in full accord with the 
views already noted of other contributors is shown by the fol- 
lowing statements : 
Our educational system has been made for city people, and the country 
school finds it second hand and ill-fitting and unattractive. To this fact 
more than any other, perhaps, is due the backwardness of education in agri- 
cultural states. 
Quoted from a private letter: 
Statistics show that in this state each year sixty young men take up 
ministry, sixty-six law, and seventy-two medicine, while 13,000 annually 
take up agriculture as a gainful pursuit. But our school books are written 
for the few not the many..... At present the entire curriculum leads 
away from the farm..... Pick up any high-grade arithmetic in use in 
the rural schools and you will find no lack of attention to banking and 
commissions and foreign exchange and commercial affairs generally. But 
agriculture arises to no such dignity—not even in schools that will find five 
times as many recruits for the farm as for the city. The same applies to 
other texts. 
The typical examples above presented of popular periodical 
literature on rural education appeared in 1903. This year was 
chosen because it seemed to mark the beginning of a somewhat 
general public interest in the subject, and partly because most of 
the development of agricultural education in elementary and 
secondary schools has taken place since that time. 
During the period from 1904 to the present the subject of 
rural education has continued to receive notice in popular peri- 
odicals (105, 109, 110, 111, 112). The public has been kept in- 
formed concerning various phases of its development, agricultural 
and other industrial work in schools receiving especial attention.
-P-A-G-E-88
80 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
One magazine addressed the following question to a num- 
ber of prominent educators: “What new subject or new method 
or new direction of effort or new tendency in educational work 
is of most value and significance and now needs most emphasis 3 
and encouragement?” (113). Nineteen replies were received. 
As most of the writers were college presidents various college 
problems were mentioned as of greatest importance but no two 
proposed the same problem. The only subject that was men- 
tioned by more than three was practical education, summed up 
as follows: Trade work in public schools; interest in rural 
schools; practical studies; agriculture for rural schools; reach- 
ing all the people; teaching every man his job. 
A good account of the present status of agricultural educa- 
tion in elementary and secondary schools appeared under the 
title “Catching Them Young” (114). After describing some 
recent progress in farming methods the author adds: 
Of what value is this knowledge if the sons and daughters are to quit 
the farm, leaving corn-belt prosperity to the haphazard agriculture of the 
city-born and of transplanting foreigners who find conditions and climate 
vastly different from those of the fatherland? Therefore the corn-belt 
has at last set itself to raising that greater and more valuable crop of farm 
boys and farm girls who find material comforts and ample financial recom- 
pense on the farm. The greatest factor in the raising of this new crop is 
education. :... But the farm boys and girls in order to be interested must 
be caught young. Before they are old enough to enter the land-grant col- 
leges the lure of the city has entered their minds and the mischief is done. 
Raising bumper crops of corn and oats, the typically agricultural states of 
America have heretofore failed to raise satisfactory crops of stay-at-home 
boys and girls. 
An editorial in another magazine revives the criticism which 
appeared against rural schools a few years before. It is entitled 
“The Martian and the Farm’ (115) and makes the remarks of 
the supposed Martian who is represented as visiting an ordinary 
country school the basis of some pointed comments on the rural 
schools: 
I notice that these Americans seem to think the raising of crops to be 
quite unnecessary; and that they are applying their remarkable intelligence 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  PERIODICAL LITERATURE 81 
to the task of depopulating their rural regions. They have acuteness to see 
that if they are to drive people out of the country, they cannot begin with 
the adult population. Life in the open country is so alluring and so natural 
that even when it has not been made as complete as it might be, it holds 
people fast. So'these far-reaching Americans, in order to crowd people back 
into the cities, where they obviously want them to be, have devised a cam- 
paign of education directed toward the children. They have planned all their 
rural schools on city models. Even in such details as arithmetic problems, they 
see to it that the children’s minds should be directed toward urban life. ... . 
If this visitor were told what he interpreted as an astute campaign was a 
mere matter of stupidity and tradition, and that the American People were 
really wondering how they could check the congestion of cities, he would 
be forced, out of decent respect for the people he was visiting, to be in- 
credulous. 
How can a child born and reared in the country respect the life of the 
farmer when the community in which he lives does not regard the farmer’s 
occupation worthy of study? How can he be expected to look with ambition 
toward agriculture as a vocation when he finds that training for it is regarded 
as less important than preparation for a clerkship? How can he think of 
village and rural life as anything more than a makeshift when he finds that 
in the schools he attends there is not a word taught concerning crops or 
cattle or roads? 
The situation in this country is then contrasted with the 
national policy of rural education recently inaugurated in 
Canada and the importance of a similar movement in this country 
suggested. The criticism of the condition in rural schools as to 
their indifference to rural life does not go unchallenged. In a 
later number of the same magazine appears a reply in which the 
editor is brought to task for making implications that were not 
warranted by the facts in the case. The work in agricultural 
education of the Middle West is cited as a refutation. The 
writer in a five months’ visit in Canada had been unable to see 
any reason for holding up the Canadian scheme for rural edu- 
cation as a model for this country (116). 
Another letter of reply is published from a farmer who could 
see no more reason why “a country child should be taught how 
to run a farm than a city child should be taught how to run a 
bank.”
-P-A-G-E-90
    82 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
It seems plain to me [he says] that the public schools are intended to 
give the young a practical education to prepare them for life, not to prepare 
them for any particular work in life..... Why tax the community in 
general to instruct its children for work and life on the farm, when many 
of the patrons and many of the children themselves would prefer general 
education? (117). 
The above editorial and its sequel, the two letters of reply, give 
some insight into the present situation. No doubt the condition 
referred to in the editorial does not apply to all rural schools 
but in general it is not much overdrawn. The writer of the 
first letter unduly magnifies the work of agricultural education 
in this country, for it has not had time to modify the ordinary 
rural schools to any considerable extent, even in the favored 
Middle West. On the other hand, his five months’ visit in 
Canada failed to show him that the efforts of the Canadian 
educators are aimed directly at the rural schools. The second 
letter reveals an attitude which is familiar to those who have 
undertaken to hold up the chief interest of a rural community 
as a motive for better schools. 
In reviewing the relation of popular periodicals to agricul- 
tural education only typical examples have been given. No 
attempt has been made to have the references complete. Suffi- 
cient citations have been given to indicate the character and scope 
of the discussions of the subject as they have appeared in these 
periodicals, and to show the service rendered by keeping the 
subject before the public, and by helping to secure a favorable 
attitude toward the improvement of rural schools. 
Brief reference should be made also to periodicals whose 
circulation is limited to smaller groups of readers. There is a 
large number published in the interest of farmers. Most of 
them are local, being chiefly confined in circulation to a single 
state. Many are of doubtful value. Those that are really sincere 
in their efforts to improve farm life have exerted considerable in- 
fluence for the betterment of rural schools and for the introduc- 
tion of agriculture. Special articles as well as letters from sub-
-P-A-G-E-91
  PERIODICAL LITERATURE 83 
scribers are published. The most important of these are reviewed 
from time to time in the Experiment Station Record of the United 
States Department of Agriculture (17) and need not be men- 
tioned here except in this general way. On the whole, agricultural 
periodicals have maintained too conservative an attitude toward 
agricultural education, both as to colleges, and to elementary 
and secondary schools. One cannot avoid the suspicion that this 
attitude on the part of some of these publications is not wholly 
disinterested. Agricultural education would, among other 
things, most certainly develop more critical readers, and this 
would soon react upon the circulation or upon the character of 
the matter published. Again, the fear of offending some of their 
readers, thus affecting circulation, makes the publishers cautious 
in giving space to views that might unsettle the faith of the 
fathers in the little one-room school. 
Occasionally a well-written article on agricultural education 
appears in the more special periodicals. For example, in a maga- 
zine ‘devoted to the philosophy of science” we find a discussion 
of “Agriculture the Basis of Education” (118). The writer 
regards the two primal contacts of the child, with nature and 
with parents, as more fundamental than all questions of subject- 
matter and methods of formal education. “The mental con- 
ditions of agriculture are just as essential to normal development 
of the human mind as air, food, and exercise for the development 
of the human body.” He refers to the education of the 
early Greeks in support of his views: “The young Greek of 
the Homeric age appears to have had much more intimate and 
adequate contacts with nature and with his elders than our 
modern education provides, or even permits.” 
A similar conclusion as to the educational influence of agri- 
culture, though discussed from an entirely different standpoint, 
is found in an article on “Farm Life as a Basis of Practical 
Education” (119). The subject for another discussion is the 
“Need for Agricultural Education” (120). The economic im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
portance of this kind of education is urged. Another point of 
view is set forth under the title “Rural Education” (121). 
Rural education is but a section of the general school question; agricul- 
tural education is a branch of technical training. These two phases of 
education of the farm population meet at many points, they must work in 
harmony, and together they form a distinct educational problem. 
Three difficulties are mentioned: (1) To secure a modern 
school equal to the city school; (2) to enrich and expand the cur- 
riculum so as to make it a vital and coherent part of rural- 
community life; (3) to provide adequate high-school facilities 
in the rural community.
-P-A-G-E-93
  CHAPTER X 
STATE ORGANIZATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE-FARMERS’ 
INSTITUTES 
Perhaps no other offices concerned with the public business 
of various states include so wide a range of activities, duties, 
aims, and methods as do the state organizations for agriculture. 
One state commissioner of agriculture says of his department: 
If I were asked to supply a name, it would be called the Dumping 
Ground for a Legislature to place all subject-matter that body finds neces- 
sary to frame into law. 
The justice of this observation will be more readily appre- 
ciated by reference to the following constitutional provisions for 
his office: 
He shall perform such duties in relation to agriculture as may be pre- 
scribed by law, shall have supervision of all matters pertaining to the public 
Jands under regulations prescribed by law, and shall keep the Bureau of 
Immigration. He shall also have supervision of the State Prison, and 
shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by law. 
Some state organizations for agriculture have even a wider 
range of duties. On the other hand, there are some in which 
the duties of this office are limited to the supervision of the 
state agricultural college, or to the management of the state 
fair. 
There are five forms of organization. The first includes those organi- 
zations known as “Departments” and consists of a commissioner and one 
or more assistants. The second form comprises the boards, which are com- 
posed of a varying number of members, some appointed by the governor 
and others being members of the board by virtue of their official position 
in the state. The third includes bureaus which are essentially the same 
as the boards. The fourth form is a combination of the first and second; 
the regular department is supervised by a board of agriculture. The fifth 
and final form is that known as the Michigan organization, under which 
the state board of agriculture is merely a board of trustees for the state 
agricultural college (122, p. 328). 
85
-P-A-G-E-94
86 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
In about half the states the administrative officer is chosen 
by popular vote; in the rest he is appointed by the governor 
or chosen by the members of the board. Being thus a political 
office in some instances, the position as secretary or commis- 
sioner of agriculture is more or less on a political basis, and 
therefore fails properly to fulfil the purpose for which it was 
intended, viz., to promote the agricultural interests of the state. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to sum up the work now 
being done by the various state departments, and by the state 
farmers’ institutes in promoting agricultural education, particu- 
larly in elementary and secondary schools. 
In one-half of the states the farmers’ institutes are con- 
ducted under the direct or indirect control of the state organi- 
zations for agriculture; in the other half they are conducted by 
the state agricultural colleges. Since the methods and aims of 
all farmers’ institutes are essentially the.same in both groups, 
those under state supervision and those under state agricultural 
college supervision will be considered in the second part of this 
discussion. As might be expected, the attitude of the various 
state organizations for agriculture is favorable toward agricul- 
tural education in the public schools. In many reports of sec- 
retaries or commissioners of agriculture much emphasis is placed 
upon the importance of recognizing agriculture as a school 
subject. The following extract is typical: 
The Department has continued its efforts to impress upon the people 
of the state the importance and necessity of agricultural and industrial 
instruction in the public schools. These schools should fit for vocation. 
The population of this and other states is continually increasing, and in 
order for the farms to meet this increase there must be a more intelligent 
system of agriculture. This can best be brought about by teaching the 
principles of agriculture in the public schools. The farmer has a business 
to be studied and learned. It needs a trained mind as much as any oth r 
occupation. Let us educate our boys who are to be farmers of the future, 
for that work. Specific training of a practical kind is a necessity for the 
coming occupants of our farms, as well as those engaged in mechanical 
industries. The most valuable asset of the state is her children. They
-P-A-G-E-95
  
STATE ORGANIZATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE 87 
should be trained to high ideals of every day living and to high efficiency 
in their respective vocations (123, p. 11). 
At the annual meetings of boards of agriculture of several 
states agricultural education receives attention, special addresses 
being given on this subject and published in the proceedings 
(124, 125, 126, 127). 
Special bulletins or leaflets are published and distributed 
by a few state offices of agriculture. The Massachusetts 
State Board of Agriculture has issued from time to time 
leaflets on elementary agriculture and nature-study. The New 
York State Department of Agriculture publishes annual reports 
of the state Experiment Station at Cornell University. These 
contain reprints of various nature-study, rural school, and 
teachers’ leaflets sent out from Cornell University, and also 
accounts of the extension work in agriculture and nature- 
study conducted by the university among the schools of the 
state. The Missouri State Board has recently published 
a bulletin on elementary agriculture meant to be used “only 
as the first year’s work,” and “written on the supposition that 
neither teacher nor pupils know much of scientific agriculture” 
(128). 
About half of the states hold annual state fairs under 
the management of the state offices of agriculture. In nearly 
all, there is a department of education in which prizes are 
offered for school exhibits. Some give special encouragement 
to agricultural subjects. The prizes amount to a few dollars in 
some fairs and to several hundred in others. 
The Nebraska State Fair offered “to the Nebraska boy 
under eighteen years of age, growing the largest yield of corn 
from one acre of ground, in the year 1910, $50; second, $25; 
third, $20; fourth, $15; fifth, $10; and to the sixth, seventh, 
eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh, $5 each.” 
The South Dakota State Fair made the boys’ and girls’ 
contests a special feature at its recent meeting. Three hundred 
and fifty dollars were offered in cash prizes, the largest first
-P-A-G-E-96
  
  88 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
prize being one hundred dollars. The contest was announced 
in a special bulletin containing instructions as to the details of 
preparation for the contests (129). 
One of the most popular buildings at the last Minnesota 
State Fair was the Agricultural Hall Annex which was devoted 
entirely to the exhibits in agriculture, household arts, and 
manual training of the ten high schools receiving state aid for 
teaching these subjects. 
The Oklahoma State Fair of 1910 arranged for a school 
of agriculture to be held on its grounds. Each county js 
entitled to two delegates, one hundred and fifty-four boys 
being provided for. “This work will be done at the fair 
grounds, The boys and instructors will sleep in a large tent.” 
A portion of each day is to be devoted to instruction, lectures 
in the mornings and object-teaching or laboratory work in the 
afternoons (130). A similar school for boys is conducted by 
the Illinois State Fair (131). 
Contests, for example, corn contests, are held in some states 
under the direction of the state office of agriculture. Such 
contests are being held in Missouri this year all over the state, 
and a Farm Boys’ Encampment is conducted under the same 
management. In South Carolina contests have been held through- 
out the state under the joint direction of the State Department 
of Agriculture and the United States Demonstration Work. In 
the state contest which is soon to take place over three thousand 
boys are enrolled. The winner of last year’s contest, Bascomb 
Usher, raised on one acre one hundred and fifty-two and one- 
half bushels of corn. The average production of corn per acre 
for the entire state was about eighteen bushels. A number of 
other southern states are conducting similar co-operative contests 
(see chap. xii). 
South Carolina, through its Department of Agriculture, has 
been aiding the practical teaching of agriculture in a few high 
schools by maintaining a skilled teacher and operating a farm

and practice garden in connection with the school (132). The 
commissioner says: 
This has been in the nature of an experiment, but we have gone far 
enough in the matter to see that admirable results may be obtained, and 
at a very minimum of cost. The only cost, in fact, to us is the salary of 
the man nine months in the year. The land is furnished by the patrons of 
the school, as are also the work animals, implements, fertilizers, etc., and 
the school is given the profits from the farm.x 
These are typical examples of the work of various state 
offices of agriculture in promoting an interest in agriculture and 
rural life among boys and girls. Many others might have 
been given. It is a new field of activity for these offices, and 
promises much if organized and extended so as to co-operate 
with other educational efforts. Perhaps the greatest value of 
such work for agricultural education to the public schools lies 
in placing the stamp of official approval upon this kind of 
education. 
In many states practically nothing has been done by these 
offices, and in none more than a beginning of what might be 
done. The state and county fairs, for example, offer unusual 
educational opportunities. If the same energy now expended in 
managing and controlling amusement-park features of these fairs 
(which are of doubtful value at best) were directed toward 
helping the schools of rural communities there might be a great 
educational gain for the state (133). 
STATE FARMERS’ INSTITUTES 
The farmers’ institute movement in the United States has now reached 
a degree of importance and development that places it along side of the 
leading institutions of the country organized in the interest of industrial 
education. Forty-five states and territories held institutes in 1905, aggre- 
gating 10,555 half-day sessions, which were attended by 995,192 persons, 
chiefly adults (134, p. 7). 
The growth of this movement may be seen by comparing 
the above summary for 1905 with the following summary for 
1908: number of institutes 4,643; half-day sessions 13,056; 
* Quoted from private letter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98

attendance 2,098,268. In addition to the regular institutes 
included in the above a number of special institutes were held 
with an attendance of 340,414, which, added to the attendance 
at the regular institutes, make a total of 2,438,682. There is 
no record of attendance of 732 meetings of women’s institutes, 
of 174 meetings of boys’ institutes, or of several other meetings 
which might be regarded as farmers’ institutes (135). 
The function of the farmers’ institute is to educate the people on their 
own ground. It is a phase of extension work that carries education 
directly to the localities in which the people live. It deals less with indi- 
vidual men on their farms than with small communities or groups of men; 
it therefore has the opportunity to exert great influence in developing the 
social life of rural neighborhoods (122, p. 462). 
With these aims on the one hand, and with an attendance 
of over two million on the other, farmers’ institutes become a 
factor in rural education second only to the public schools. 
Although the institutes are intended for adults it must be 
remembered that adults are patrons of the rural schools, and 
wherever the farmers’ institute arouses the adult population 
to a realization of a need for better schools, improvement in 
these schools is likely to follow. 
In 1896 the American Association of Farmers’ Institute 
Workers was organized and has held annual meetings ever since. 
This association is a sort of clearing-house for exchange of 
ideas and methods, and is intended also to secure a more or 
less uniform type of institute in the several states. In 1898 
the association requested the secretary of the Department of 
Agriculture at Washington to arrange for a division in con- 
nection with the department to be known as the Division of 
Farmers’ Institutes. This request was subsequently granted by 
establishing the office of Farmers’ Institute Specialist.” 
The general policy of farmers’ institutes is influenced greatly 
by the association and by the office of Farmers’ Institute Spe- 
cialist. At the meeting for 1908, the 
? The work of this office was referred to in chap. i.
-P-A-G-E-99
STATE ORGANIZATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE 91 
subjects for discussion in the general program were mainly directed toward 
defining the status of the farmers’ institute in its relation to other forms 
of agricultural education. The points brought out were that the farmers’ 
institute occupies the position of field agent for agricultural education; that 
it provides a most efficient channel for carrying agricultural information 
directly to the farmer who is unable to leave his occupation to go to school; 
and that it should broaden its work until it embraces other more advanced 
forms of educational work and extend its efforts until all rural people 
have full opportunity to enjoy its benefits (135, p. 293). 
Farmers’ institute workers are further assisted by state meet- 
ings where they gather together to plan the year’s work. Here 
the policy for the work of the whole state is determined. In 
many of these meetings the relation of the institute to the 
public schools receives attention, and methods for assisting the 
introduction of agriculture and other rural-life subjects into 
the rural schools are discussed. 
The following extracts of letters from some state directors 
or superintendents of farmers’ institutes will indicate more 
definitely what these institutes are doing in this matter: 
In connection with the Farmers’ Demonstration Train we always send 
preliminary notice to the schools where the train is scheduled to stop, 
inviting them to have their pupils visit the train (Cal.). 
At our annual conference of institute workers, the question of the 
relation of the school and church to the farm and rural life receives due 
consideration. The result is that an atmosphere favorable to the develop- 
ment of the schools along practical lines is pretty generally diffused (Ind.). 
The farmers’ institute lecturers have encouraged institute patrons to 
insist in their respective counties that agriculture be taught in the public 
schools (Md.). 
Not only is this subject discussed by many of the lecturers, but at a 
large number of the institutes special speakers upon this and allied subjects 
are provided (Mich.). 
For two years we have been giving lectures in agriculture and allied 
subjects in the high schools of the state; last year to the extent of eighty. 
Plans are nearly perfected for increasing this line of work the coming 
season, giving lecture courses consisting of four lectures in each of such 
schools as apply for them (Mont.). 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
    
92 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
We have several speakers who lecture before evening sessions of farm- 
ers’ institutes on such subjects as: agriculture in the rural schools, domestic 
science in the rural schools, value of agricultural education, etc. (Neb.). 
Each of the four corps of institute lecturers is accompanied by a repre- 
sentative of the Educational Department who arranges for special sessions 
in the public schools in connection with institutes where he can secure co- 
operation of the local school authorities. At these special sessions the 
farmers’ institute lecturers give talks on elementary agriculture and nature- 
study. The total attendance at these special sessions held during the school 
periods amounted to 22,697 (N.Y.). 
When we are holding an institute in a town we very often send the 
lecturers to the schools to speak to the school children on certain phases of 
farm life (N.D.). 
No instructions are given institute lecturers regarding this work; how- 
ever, at many institutes teachers and pupils are called to the meeting and 
special lectures are given them (Okla.). 
We are trying to give a good deal of attention to the introduction of 
agricultural education in the public schools. I have attended ten teachers’ 
institutes during the summer with this object in view, speaking at some 
of them three times, and I think the subject has been discussed by some 
person in every institute in the-state (S.D.). 
Our farmers’ institute instructors do what they can to promote and 
encourage the teaching of agriculture in the rural schools. Many of them 
have lectures upon this subject (W.Va.). 
For the last twenty-four years a great deal of attention has been given 
to the discussion of agricultural education in the public schools of Wis- 
consin by the farmers’ institute workers of this state; in fact, we feel that 
public sentiment among farmers has been developed by these discussions 
until Wisconsin has, we think, a little more practical agriculture in her 
schools, from the rural district up through the county agricultural schools 
and the agricultural college, than has any other state in the Union (Wis.). 
In most states where the farmers’ institute is conducted by 
the agricultural college there is a close correlation between this 
department and that of agricultural extension. In some colleges 
they are practically identical. As has been indicated in chap. v, 
provision is made by several colleges for extension work among 
the schools. Where this arrangement obtains, the farmers’ insti-
-P-A-G-E-101
  STATE ORGANIZATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE 93 
tute workers merely co-operate with those engaged in the work 
among the schools, and do not initiate any work themselves. 
From what has been presented concerning the organization 
and work of the farmers’ institutes it will be seen that they 
have been a considerable factor in the movement for agricul- 
tural education in the public schools, first, by arousing favorable 
sentiment among the farmers, and second, by direct help to 
teacher and pupils. 
While these institutes will doubtless continue to encourage 
the introduction of agriculture into the public schools and em- 
phasize the importance of re-directing rural schools, in many 
states, and soon in all the agricultural states, the demands of 
the rural schools for help along industrial lines will require 
some special attention not now provided.

  CHAPTER XI 
AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES 
The development of agricultural societies may be divided 
into four periods: (1) from 1785 to 1850—the period of begin- 
nings; (2) from 1850 to 1870—the period of agricultural fairs; 
(3) from 1870 to 1892—the period of great organizations; (4) 
from 1892 to the present—the period of adjustment (122, p. 
291). 
FIRST PERIOD 
The first period in its relation to agricultural education is an 
important one, particularly in its historical significance. The influ- 
ence of these early societies on agricultural education is perhaps 
greater than that of any other single factor contributing to its 
development. The idea of such an education is regarded by 
some as originating in these societies. That it was much ex- 
ploited by them is certainly true. The idea persisted and grew, 
and may be followed from this early period to the establishment 
of land-grant colleges. The idea persists today, but modified 
to include elementary and secondary education. 
In 1785 the Philadelphia Society for the Promotion of Agri- 
culture was organized, and later in the same year a similar society 
was formed at Charleston, S.C. Within the following decade a 
number of other societies was organized. Among the members 
of these societies were many prominent men such as George 
Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Timothy Pickering. 
These men were also interested in education. It is not strange 
that the two interests should be combined in their minds into 
the idea of agricultural education. 
Benjamin Franklin had given expression to this idea many 
years before the founding of the first agricultural society. 
Referring to the education of the youth of Pennsylvania he says: 
94
-P-A-G-E-103
AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES 95 
While they are reading natural history might not a little gardening, 
planting, grafting, inoculating be taught and practiced, and now and then 
excursions made to the neighboring plantations of the best farms, their 
methods observed and reasoned upon for the information of youth, the 
improvement of agriculture being useful to all and skill in it no disparage- 
ment to any? (122, p. 361). 
This idea was first put into actual practice in 1792 when 
agriculture became a subject of instruction in Columbia College. 
This was brought about chiefly through the agitation of the New 
York, and other agricultural societies. Another example of the 
attitude of these early societies toward agricultural education is 
found in the action of the Philadelphia Society in 1794. The 
society appointed a committee to outline a plan for establishing 
a “State Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, connecting 
with it the Education of Youth in the knowledge of that most 
important Art while they are acquiring other useful knowledge 
suitable for the agricultural citizens of the State.” The plan 
which was drawn up and presented to the society includes some 
very definite references to agricultural education. Agricultural 
information was to be disseminated in whatever manner the 
legislature should think best, “whether by endowing professor- 
ships to be annexed to the University of Pennsylvania and the 
College of Carlisle, and other seminaries of learning, or for the 
purpose of teaching the chemical philosophy and elementary 
parts of the theory of agriculture.” County societies were to be 
created with “county schoolmasters” as secretaries ; and the school- 
houses the places of meeting and the repositories of their trans- 
actions, models, etc. “The legislature may enjoin on these school- 
masters the combination of the subject of agriculture with other 
parts of education. This may easily be effected by introducing, 
as school books, those on this subject, and thereby making it 
familiar to their pupils” (122, p. 363). The fact that the plan 
of the committee was rejected does not alter its significance in 
its bearing upon subsequent developments in agricultural educa- 
tion. It is especially noteworthy that the plan proposed is in 
harmony with some present-day practices: the rural school as a

community center, correlation of agriculture with other school 
subjects, and agricultural textbooks. 
During this entire period the subject of agricultural education 
was much discussed. Various plans were proposed for its develop- 
ment. Some provided that the societies themselves should organ- 
ize stock companies to establish schools for instruction in agri- 
cultural subjects. Several such schools were started, but owing 
to difficulties (chiefly financial) they were not successful. These 
attempts were an important stage in the evolution of the agri- 
cultural college. 
Stock-company plans were succeeded by others involving state 
or federal support. The agricultural societies representing asso- 
ciated effort were finally able to secure the attention of legis- 
lative bodies. In New York State, for example, the New York 
State Agricultural Society began a campaign for a school of 
agriculture soon after the date of its organization (1832), 
and continued it until 1853 when the legislature granted a char- 
ter for such an institution. The founding of the Agricultural 
College of Cornell University was no doubt due in a large 
measure to the activity of the New York State Agricultural 
Society, and of other agricultural societies of the state. 
The Michigan State Agricultural Society which was formed 
in 1849 immediately set to work to secure a state agricultural 
college. Its efforts at once secured the attention of the legis- 
lature. The matter was brought up at each session of the 
legislature until, in 1855, a bill authorizing the establishment of 
the State Agricultural College of Michigan became a law. 
“The Industrial League of the State of Illinois,” chiefly 
composed of farmers, had much to do with the passage of the 
Land Grant Act of 1862. This League was an outgrowth of 
the meeting of a convention held at Granville, Putnam County, 
Illinois, November 18, 1851. The object of this convention 
“was to take into consideration such means as might be deemed 
most expedient to further the interests of the agricultural com- 
munity, and particularly to take steps toward the establishment  
-P-A-G-E-105
  AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES 97 
of an agricultural university” (136, p. 20). Jonathan B. Turner 
proposed a plan at this meeting which included “a university 
for industrial classes in each state in the Union.” The plan 
adopted was published and widely circulated throughout the 
country. Another convention was held at Springfield, Illinois, 
June 8, 1852. At this convention a memorial was presented, 
containing, among other things, a definite plan for organizing 
agricultural colleges: ‘‘An appropriate endowment of universi- 
ties for the liberal education of the industrial classes in their 
several pursuits in each state in the Union” (136, p. 22). A 
third convention was held at Chicago, November 24, 1852. It 
was decided at this meeting to organize “The Industrial League 
of the State of Illinois” for the purpose of forwarding the 
objects of the convention, one object being “to obtain a grant 
of public land to establish and endow industrial institutions in 
each and every state in the Union. “A fourth convention was 
held at Springfield on January 4, 1853. Here a final plan was 
approved in the form of a petition to Congress (136, pp. 24 and 
104). Copies were distributed to the various other agricultural 
and industrial societies throughout the country. These societies 
were asked to adopt the plan and urge its approval by Congress. 
The campaign for passage by Congress of an act embodying 
this plan was actively continued by the Industrial League of 
the State of Illinois, and by similar organizations in other states 
until it became a law, July 2, 1862. 
The activities of the agricultural societies of New York, 
Michigan, and Illinois in promoting agricultural education is 
typical of what was accomplished by similar societies in Pennsyl- 
vania, Connecticut, and other states during this period. 
SECOND PERIOD 
In 1858 there were over 900 agricultural and horticultural 
societies listed at the Patent Office, and in 1868 the Department 
of Agriculture listed 1,350. All but about 100 of these were 
organized after 1849 (122, p. 292).  
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The chief interest of most of these societies was in holding 
fairs. In many ways these fairs were of considerable educa- 
tional value, especially in diffusing new ideas, in furnishing an 
opportunity for social intercourse, and in introducing better farm 
practice and new types of farm products. Often addresses by 
prominent speakers were provided as special educational features. 
On the whole this period was marked by a great development 
of organized effort, including associations of many kinds, and 
ranging from national organizations to mere local farmers’ clubs. 
THIRD PERIOD 
This period is characterized by large associations, national in 
scope. It represents a stage in development when agricultural 
people began to recognize the importance of “getting together,” 
and of using co-operative means for securing better business 
and educational opportunities, and more favorable legisla- 
tion. This was undertaken through large formal organizations, 
through co-operative concerns which were intended to do away 
with the “middleman,” through activity in politics, and through 
education, directly by means of colleges and other schools, and 
by means of discussions and publications. Several large organi- 
zations constituted the machinery of this movement, the most 
important of which were the Grange and the Farmers’ Alliance. 
The Grange was founded in 1867, and became a national 
society in 1873.1 It is a very complete organization with the 
lodge as a unit, subordinate to the County Grange which is sub- 
ordinate to the State Grange, this in turn being subordinate to the 
National Grange. The purposes are fraternal, social, educational, 
political, and financial. Educational work is a feature of each 
meeting, a certain part of the program being devoted to this 
subject. Sometimes the educational work of the lodges of a 
whole state is planned definitely by one of the state officers, the 
state grand lecturer. The meetings of the lodge are often held

Sci. Mo., V, 32, p. 199.
-P-A-G-E-107
  
AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES 99 
in schoolhouses, thus making the school property a community 
center for adults as well as children. The interest of the 
Grange in the school does not stop with the use of the school- 
house as a meeting-place, but it lends its support to all measures 
intended for the betterment of rural education, and particularly 
to those involving a greater use of country-life subjects. The 
Grange was for a time a very powerful society, but by 1880 its 
power as a national organization was lost.2 It declined rapidly 
both in membership and influence until ten years later when it 
began to revive again. 
The Farmers’ Alliance was somewhat similar to the Grange 
in plan and purpose. Its activity however was chiefly directed 
toward securing better legislation favorable to rural interests, 
mainly financial. Soon after the formation of the Populist party 
little was left of the Farmers’ Alliance as an organization. 
FOURTH PERIOD 
With more than a century of experience agricultural societies 
are now being readjusted to secure for all interests of agricul- 
ture and rural life advantages that may be secured only through 
organized effort. They may be classified into three groups: 
national, state, and local. A large number of each group is 
devoted to some special agricultural interest, such as bee-keeping, 
apple production, sheep-breeding, and the like, almost every con- 
ceivable phase of agriculture being represented by an organization. 
Of the national societies the Grange is perhaps the most 
important. Since 1890 it has emphasized social and educational 
features, and has recovered from the decline of the previous 
decade. Its interest and influence in educational matters are 
greater than ever before. 
*The rise and decline of the Grange is well illustrated by the number of granges organ- 
ized each year in Illinois for a period of eight years:

-P-A-G-E-108
  100 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
There are now over seven hundred state agricultural societies 
most of which are devoted to special interests. In some states 
the state society has no connection with local societies, but in 
others the state organization is made up of representatives from 
local societies. 
The latter plan is well illustrated by the Michigan State 
Association of Farmers’ Clubs. In 1908 the state associa- 
tion included one hundred and twenty clubs from thirty-two 
counties. In 1908 these clubs had a membership of over seven 
thousand. The association holds an annual meeting in which a 
majority of the associated clubs are represented. The program 
consists of reports of various clubs, several addresses on sub- 
jects of general interest to farmers, and reports of committees. 
A good example of the work of a local club is shown by the 
following synopsis of its annual report to the association: 
The club is eleven years old, with a membership of 71, and average 
attendance of 50. Annual dues are ten cents per member; the club holds 
twelve meetings a year, all-day meetings from October to April. Men’s 
meetings in February, May; temperance meetings in February, March; 
young people’s meetings in April; ladies’ meeting in May; club fair in 
October; picnic in August. The club publishes a paper called the Rural 
Grit (137, p. 15). 
The addresses at the annual meetings are on topics of general 
interest to farmers, often on agricultural education. The most 
important committee is the one on resolutions. Some recom- 
mendations directed toward legislation are usually found in its 
reports. 
The published proceedings of the various agricultural socie- 
ties contain important contributions to the literature of agri- 
cultural education. The importance lies not so much in the new 
points of view or new ideas presented as in the fact that these 
articles indicate the attitude of the most progressive farmers on 
this question. The Report of the Proceedings of the New 
Jersey Horticultural Society for 1910 contains a discussion of 
“What Shall We Teach the Farmer’s Child?” (138). A scheme 
is proposed for dividing the school year into more equal periods
-P-A-G-E-109
  AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES IOI 
between farm practice and school work. The difficulty of apply- 
ing such a plan is found in the present long high-school year 
and short vacation period, and in the absence of instruction in 
agricultural subjects. The author may have had in mind some 
shop work, as is being introduced in Cincinnati, and in other 
places. 
The idea is suggestive of possibilities that might be developed 
in rural schools to advantage, provided the long vacation period 
were spent in applying the scientific principles of agriculture to 
farm practice. The boys of the Baltimore County (Md.) Agri- 
cultural High School carry on extensive experiments on their 
home farms during vacation periods. Their work is inspected 
from time to time by the teacher of agriculture in the high 
school, the teacher being employed to give his time during the 
entire year to school matters. This plan has been in operation 
only one year, but the results have been very satisfactory. Such 
an arrangement would do away with some of the objections to 
the present system of education raised by the above paper, that 
the 
high schools are simply feeding the boys and girls to universities and general 
colleges, but unfitting them for the practical duties of life..... One great 
trouble with farming today is the fact that for half a century or more 
country teachers have worn the label and wire of an education arranged 
for a town school. The material benefits of education, such as they are in 
a public way, and the public spirit of it, have been town bred and built. 
One great reason why farming of late years has become more hopeful and 
prosperous is because we are at last developing a definite form and spirit 
of farm education. 
There are so many societies publishing proceedings that no 
further reference will be made except to refer to the fact that the 
discussions appearing in these proceedings on instruction in 
agriculture in the public schools usually favor such instruction, 
but not always. Occasionally views are expressed against it. 
In the Proceedings of the Iowa Horticultural Society for 1909 
we find an example of the latter (139). The writer reviews 
the conditions of the Iowa rural schools. His own county has 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
    1oz2 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
208 rural schools. He regards the introduction of agricultural 
instruction in these schools as impossible, even if desirable. He 
would improve the teaching of these schools by placing more 
emphasis on the “three R’s.” He says, “the most persistent and 
able advocates of agriculture in the public schools are teachers 
and professors in our state and other colleges.” This is not an 
isolated example of the conservative attitude of the farmer 
toward education. Similar views are held in every farming 
community in the country. The little one-room school is re- 
garded as necessary for any scheme of rural education. If the 
scheme does not fit into the existing system it is unworthy. 
Much of the opposition to consolidation is no doubt due to the 
reluctance of abandoning the single-room school, and to the 
inability to see how a readjustment of school affairs can be 
brought about. 
The sentence just quoted referring to “teachers and pro- 
fessors” advocating agricultural instruction shows a little of the 
resentment that has grown up lately in several parts of the 
country toward the activity of those interested in the promo- 
tion of agricultural education in the elementary and secondary 
schools. A prominent agricultural journal has recently cast 
some reflection on the motives of some of the men now engaged 
in agricultural extension among public schools, intimating that 
the matter is being agitated for the benefit of agricultural col- 
leges. The editor finds some sympathy among his readers, as 
evidenced by a protest from one subscriber against so much 
space being given to school matters, and so little being given to 
the discussion of sheep-killing dogs! 
Particular mention should be made of the work of the 
Massachusetts Horticultural Society in its relation to the school- 
garden movement (140). Soon after Henry L. Clapp intro- 
duced school gardening into the George Putnam School of Boston, 
the Massachusetts Horticultural Society began to encourage the 
establishment of school gardens in other places in New England 
by offering prizes for the best gardens entering competition, and
-P-A-G-E-111
AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES 103 
by giving prominence to the subject in its published proceedings. 
Since 1893, one feature of its annual meeting is the session 
devoted to hearing reports on school gardens. The growth of 
the school-garden movement of the United States owes much 
to this society. 
The following are a few extracts from letters written by 
officers of some agricultural societies in answer to an inquiry 
as to what their societies are now doing toward promoting 
agricultural education. These are typical expressions, and are 
taken at random from a number of replies: 
Our meetings are always public and we invite teachers, students, and the 
general public to attend the sessions. We have not taken any definite steps 
toward the teaching of agriculture or horticulture in the schools, although 
whenever occasion offers, we are glad to say a word favoring the move- 
ment (Vermont). 
We have held sessions at the State Normal Schools and have had ad- 
dresses that we thought would be of value to prospective teachers (New 
Jersey). 
We think it is an important subject and hope to see more of at least 
the rudiments of horticulture taught in the schools soon (Kansas). 
We have papers and discussions in nearly every volume we publish re- 
garding horticultural subjects, bearing on their relation to the public schools 
(Illinois). 
We have undertaken recently the task of improving in some measure the 
grounds surrounding the rural schools of the state. We have realized for 
years the deplorable conditions in this respect; the lack of adequate play- 
grounds; the lack of order and even common cleanliness, the utter lack of 
any decoration, and other things too numerous to mention. We are feeling 
our way carefully and-so far have but little to report. We have selected 
seven districts widely separated and for these schools we furnish land- 
scape plans and trees and shrubs to plant the same. We also furnish 
expert superintendence and inspection. So far the work has been very dis- 
couraging on account of the lack of co-operation or even friendly spirit on 
the part of school officers and teachers. We hope, however, for better 
things and intend to keep on (Wisconsin). 
The brief account just given of agricultural societies is suffi- 
cient to indicate at least some of their most important relations to
-P-A-G-E-112

agricultural education, and to impress upon the student of rural 
education the value of their influence in any movement affecting 
the country schools. Being composed of representative mem- 
bers of the very communities that are supposed to be benefited by 
improved rural education, their point of view in educational 
matters must be considered in any plans to bring about better 
rural-school conditions and their co-operation is needed for an 
attempt to carry out these plans.

CHAPTER XII 
BOYS’ AGRICULTURAL CLUBS 
The actual introduction of agricultural subjects into the public 
schools has developed along two lines, one indirect and informal, 
the other direct and formal. They may be regarded as two 
stages of one development, for experience seems to indicate that 
creating an interest informally by means of boys’ agricultural 
clubs is often, if not always, the most successful method of 
introducing the study of agriculture into the schools of a com- 
munity. 
Indeed, in many places where formal instruction has failed 
boys’ clubs have been a great success. This is well illustrated 
in Louisiana. In that state, although the teaching of agricul- 
ture has been required since 1898, it has not received much 
serious attention in the elementary schools. But boys’ clubs are 
being organized in every parish in the state, one parish school 
boys’ club, for example, enrolling during the present year 555 
members. This form of agricultural instruction is extending 
rapidly over the entire country, and is becoming a very impor- 
tant extension work in education as well as in agriculture. It 
tends to ally itself more and more with the public schools, until 
finally some more or less formal instruction becomes a regular 
part of the school work. 
Thus in Ohio the state superintendent of agricultural extension work 
writes that most boys’ and girls’ club activities are now conducted as a part 
of the school work and that agricultural clubs as such are becoming a thing 
of the past, so that no separate records or statistics are now generally 
kept in the state (rqz, p. 12). 
Two good accounts of the agricultural club movement have 
been published by the United States Department of Agriculture, 
one tracing its development to 1904 (61), the other from 1904 
to 1910 (141). The following discussion will therefore be con- 
105

106 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
fined chiefly to the present status of the movement with typical 
examples of successful work, and to the reaction of the agri- 
cultural clubs on rural education. 
Various agencies have taken the initiative in starting this movement under 
particular local conditions, but the inspiration for state-wide activity in these 
lines has generally come from some individual or official source connected 
with the state department of education, the state agricultural college, or the 
United States Department of Agriculture. In the absence of such initiative 
the work has sometimes begun in the zeal and wisdom of some county 
officer or association, as the county superintendent of schools, the farmers’ 
institute society, the county fair association, or teachers’ association, the 
Grange organization, or the Young Men’s Christian Association. Experience 
has shown that the work has always been most permanent and productive 
when it has resulted in a definite local organization, preferably under the 
leadership of the county school superintendent (141, p. 7). 
Reference has already been made to the work of the state 
and college extension departments, of state departments of edu- 
cation, and of other agencies in the organization of these clubs 
(37, 39, 41, 43, 61, 142). 
During the present year (1911) this work has been extended, 
and is becoming better organized. In 1909 there were clubs in 
twenty-eight states with a total membership of approximately 
150,000. During the present year many new clubs have been 
formed, and the membership in many of those already organized 
has increased. An instance of the latter is found in the increase 
in membership of one club from 17 in 1909 to 555 in 1910.. In 
the above estimate for 1909 several states that now have clubs are 
not included. For example, Kansas has one or more clubs in 
each county, with a total membership of more than 5,000. The 
eleven southern states that had a membership of about 13,000 
in 1909 have this year nearly 50,000 enrolled. The total mem- 
bership of 1910 for the entire country may conservatively be 
estimated at more than 300,000. 
The most important recent development is that of the Boys’ 
Corn Club work in the southern states. This work was under- 
taken by representatives of the United States Bureau of Plant  
-P-A-G-E-115
  BOYS’ AGRICULTURAL CLUBS 107 
Industry through county superintendents of education four 
years ago. Three years ago it was extended in a few counties 
of the Gulf states where the boll weevil was damaging cotton 
crops. At the beginning of 1909 a systematic plan was under- 
taken to organize boys’ corn clubs in a few counties in each 
of the southern states. There were enrolled 12,400 boys. 
During 1910 in response to further demands the organizations 
have been extended into nearly 600 counties, with a total enrol- 
ment of 46,225 boys. Although no statistical summary of the 
work has been issued, a number of reports have been received 
by the department which show excellent work. In one county in 
Mississippi 48 boys produced an average yield of 92 bushels per 
acre; 20 boys in one county of South Carolina made 1,700 
bushels of corn on 20 acres. Another club of 142 boys produced 
an average of 62 bushels to the acre, several going above 100, 
and two or three above 150 bushels. 
The Boys’ Corn Club work is the Junior Department of 
the Government Demonstration Work now being carried on in 
all the southern states. The results of the boys’ work have at- 
tracted the attention of the entire country. Considerable promi- 
nence was given to it by the public press in 1909, but much 
more to the results of 1910, particularly to the remarkable 
achievement of Jerry Moore of Winona, S.C., a boy not fifteen 
years old, who produced 22834 bushels of corn on one acre of 
land, this being the second largest yield per acre in the history 
of corn production.” 
The crowning event of the work of 1910 was a visit to 
Washington on December 12, 1910, of the prize winners from 
eleven southern states. They were awarded diplomas of merit 
by the Secretary of Agriculture, presented to the President of 
the United States, and personally conducted by O. B. Martin, 
* The above facts were furnished in a letter from O. B. Martin, government assistant in 
charge of Boys’ Demonstration Work. A full account of this work has since been published 
(ts).

assistant in charge of the Junior Demonstration Work, over the 
city of Washington, visiting all places of interest. 
The relation of this work to the schools is indicated by the 
following extracts from directions for organization and instruc- 
tion sent out by the department : 
Where this work is being introduced in a county, the county superin- 
tendent of education and teachers can reach the boys in all sections of the 
county more quickly and more effectively than any other agency. The 
superintendent can explain the plan to the teachers, and they can explain 
it to the boys and secure the names of all the boys who will agree to plant 
one acre of corn..... Just as soon as the names of all the boys are 
assembled in the office of the county superintendent of education, duplicate 
lists should be sent to Dr. S. A. Knapp, Washington, D.C., who has charge 
of the Farmers’ Co-operative Demonstration Work. These boys will from 
time to time receive circulars of instruction and information in regard to 
preparation, fertilization, cultivation, seed selection, etc. These circulars 
furnish excellent subject-matter for discussion at a club meeting, or for a 
lesson in school. They lead to further study of farmers’ bulletins and 
books. A boy will profit much from such lessons, discussions, and books, 
because he is making practical application of the principles taught. He 
learns scientific agriculture because he needs it, and not because it is scien- 
tific. .. . . The object of the Boys’ Demonstration Work is the same as that 
among men, namely, better methods of farming and greater yields at less 
cost. Many of the boys in the clubs who begin to study agriculture in this 
way will continue the study in agricultural colleges; others will continue 
such efforts on their farms, and all of them will make useful and more 
effective citizens.3 
The organization of the clubs in various states differs some- 
what in details, but in general there is a close co-operation 
between the state departments of education and the state agri- 
cultural college. A good example of a state organization is the 
Farm-Life Club Movement in Alabama: 
The leading objects of the Farm-Life Club Movement are educational 
and for this reason it is our desire to make this movement have a close 
and vital connection with the work of the county superintendents of educa- 
tion, the teachers, and the schools of the state. There are many important 
educational problems in Alabama today, but the largest one is the question 
*From mimeograph directions sent out by O. B. Martin, assistant in charge of Boys’ 
Demonstration Work, June 1, ro10.
-P-A-G-E-117
BOYS’ AGRICULTURAL CLUBS 109 
of better farming. In beginning the work in a county we first secure co- 
operation of the superintendent and through him interest the teachers. The 
work is discussed at a teachers’ institute and later a letter is mailed request- 
ing each teacher to interest the boys in his school and his community in this 
work. The names of the boys are sent to the county superintendent by the 
teachers. 
This work furnishes the greatest opportunity yet launched for the county 
superintendents and teachers to be of invaluable service to the people in 
arousing interest in better farming and in improved agriculture. 
The ultimate purpose of the work is to aid the great movement for 
better farming all along the lines, and to encourage the boy to get an edu- 
cation in agriculture and to remain on the farm. 
The work in Alabama has been in progress scarcely a year and the 
results are very encouraging indeed. At present the work has been started 
in about 17 counties in the state. There is a total of approximately 2,000 
boys listed in the work. There have been raised locally among merchants, 
bankers, and other public-spirited people over $2,000 in prizes. In addition 
to this the state fairs in Birmingham and Montgomery are offering a total 
of about $500 for the boys in the corn clubs. After making these exhibits 
at the state fairs the best of these will be carried to the National Corn Show. 
It has been my pleasure during the last month to hold boys’ meetings 
in several counties and to visit a large number of individual acres of 
corn. The yield in a great many cases is very remarkable. For example, 
one boy’s acre of corn will yield at least 65 bushels of corn, and in addition 
to the corn there will be enough snap beans and corn middles to pay all 
the expenses for making the corn, including rent of land and interest on 
investment. I quote below from a letter recently received from a gentleman 
who lives in a community where a club has been organized: “Some of the 
boys are going to make 75 and 85 bushels per acre, and some are going to 
make as much as 100 bushels.” Another letter from a business man will 
give some idea as to how the business men regard the work: “I think the 
Boys’ Corn Club has worked wonders in the cultivation of corn in this state. 
I have never seen as much enthusiasm among the old farmers as now pre- 
vails, and I feel certain that the Boys’ Corn Club is largely responsible 
for it.” 
At a meeting held in northern Alabama I asked some of the boys to 
give me an idea as to the outlook of their corn crop. One, in making a 
report of his work, said: “Every farmer in a radius of two miles of my 
acre has visited my corn and said, ‘If you make 35 bushels of corn on this 
acre we are going to follow your method.’” Prospects were good for a 
yield of more than 50 bushels on this acre. The father of this boy said, 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  r10 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
“T have a special acre myself and do not propose to have my boy beat me 
raising corn.” 
This movement is not a question of adding new duties to the county 
superintendent and teachers without additional pay, but a question of oppor- 
tunity and service. No movement has yet been projected where superin- 
tendents of education and teachers may be of greater service to the people 
than in the organization of the Farm-Life clubs. This plan also furnishes 
the best method yet devised of bringing together in harmonious co-operation 
all the interests looking to better education and better farming. In this 
work the county superintendents, the teachers, the merchants, the newspapers, 
the State College of Agriculture, the State Department of Agriculture, and 
the State Department of Education can all work together for the common 
good.4 
Another important phase of the agricultural-club idea is 
being developed by the Farmers’ Institute Specialist of the Office 
of Experiment Stations of the United States Department of 
Agriculture. It is known as Farmers’ Institutes for Young 
People. The following statement in regard to these institutes 
will indicate the object and character of the work undertaken: 
In order, therefore, that opportunity to become acquainted with agri- 
cultural operations may be given to those who have left the public school 
and from whose ranks the future farmers and their wives must be supplied, 
the farmers’ institutes in several states have organized and are now con- 
ducting what is known as “institutes for young people.” The majority of 
these are not institutes in the sense in which the work of the farmers’ 
institute has come to be defined. They are in reality boys’ and girls’ clubs 
conducted in the same manner as those operated by the public schools. .... 
Because of the fundamental difficulty in securing teachers capable of 
giving vocational training and instruction in agriculture in the rural schools, 
and from the fact that after the scholars leave school no provision has 
been made for giving them the opportunity to receive such instruction, the 
farmers’ institute has undertaken the training in agriculture of rural chil- 
dren after leaving school. In doing this it has found it necessary to drop 
from its system of instruction the purely educational feature and to devote 
itself strictly to giving vocational instruction. Such studies and practice, 
therefore, as the institute utilizes have in view the perfecting of the indi- 
vidual in his vocation. The institute system, therefore, partakes more 
nearly than any other of the trade-school method, and is intended for youths

BOYS’ AGRICULTURAL CLUBS IIL 
above 14 years of age. It will become the connecting link between the 
agricultural-club movement on the one hand and the regular farmers’ insti- 
tutes for adults on the other (143). 
In 1909, 20 states and territories are reported to have held 
institutes for young people. This system seems to be the best 
organized in Indiana, where about one-third of the counties 
have such institutes with an enrolment of over 12,000. The 
young people’s institutes are held at the same time as the farm- 
ers’ institutes but in separate sessions. The public is interested 
as indicated by liberal contributions, one county appropriating, 
in 1909, $1,000 for this work. 
The extension department of the Kansas State Agricultural 
College is just introducing a correspondence school in connec- 
tion with its young people’s extension work. The object of this 
is similar to that of the young people’s institute, being designed 
to help boys and girls who have been compelled to leave school. 
The boys’ clubs of Kansas, whose work thus far has been 
almost wholly confined to corn contests, are now being organized 
on a somewhat different basis. The plan follows that of the Boy 
Scouts of America and the clubs are known as the “Rural-Life 
Scouts.” Although just started, considerable interest is being 
shown in these clubs. The leaders are generally principals of 
village schools or pastors of village churches. In counties where 
there is a Y.M.C.A. secretary, the organizations are affiliated 
with the Y.M.C.A. work. 
The county superintendent of education and his teachers 
have been an important factor in making boys’ clubs a success, 
whether under the auspices of the Government Demonstration 
Work, state agricultural colleges, or state departments of educa- 
tion. The work in large units, state or sectional, is really made 
possible by successful work carried out by county superintend- 
ents of schools or teachers in the various parts of the country. It 
may be of interest at this point to give somewhat in detail a 
concrete example of how a county superintendent of education
-P-A-G-E-120
    
112 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
went about organizing successful boys’ agricultural clubs in his 
own county. 
The county superintendent of Delaware County, Iowa, began 
to organize boys’ clubs six years ago, holding township meetings 
where the boys brought corn selected from their fathers’ seed 
corn. The meetings were addressed by an expert, on “What 
Constitutes Good Seed Corn.” This was accompanied by demon- 
strations from samples of poor and good ears. The corn brought 
by the boys was then judged and commented upon by the expert. 
The superintendent then distributed seed corn which he had 
bought for this purpose. The year following the boys came 
together in a contest showing the results obtained from the corn 
distributed the year before. This work was continued through 
the next year, except that the boys selected their own seed corn 
from their fathers’ corn. A short course in agriculture was 
held at Manchester, the county seat, which about sixty boys 
attended. The corn clubs continued to grow in interest from 
year to year until most of the boys were as good as, or even better 
judges of corn than, their fathers. Last year the work was varied 
by using oats instead of corn. The superintendent purchased 
forty bushels of Canadian oats, and distributed the seed among 
the boys of the county. At the close of the season a contest 
was held at which the results of the season’s work were shown. 
The experiment was watched with much interest throughout the 
county, and the farmers were eager to purchase seed from the 
boys for their own farms. In one year the value of Canadian 
oats for Delaware County was demonstrated by the boys, and 
oat production in the county was greatly improved. 
All this was extra school work, but the superintendent made 
good use of the interest thus aroused to help and improve the 
regular school work. Raising corn and oats became subjects of 
compositions, references to bulletins and books were used as 
reading lessons, and estimates of cost and yield furnished mate- 
rial for arithmetic. By means of printed instructions sent to 
teachers from time to time, the formal work of the schools be- 
came enlivened and strengthened by its practical application.
-P-A-G-E-121
BOYS’ AGRICULTURAL CLUBS 113 
The work in Delaware County is a typical example of 
how the education of a county or township system may be 
redirected by means of boys’ clubs. Springfield Township, 
Ohio (142), Keokuk (61) and Page (144) counties, Iowa, 
Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, Winnebago County, Illinois 
(145, 146), Wexford County, Michigan, and many other places 
might be mentioned where boys’ agricultural clubs have not only 
been the means of improving school conditions but by their 
success have led to similar work being introduced in other 
places. 
Although not connected in any way with the public schools, 
the work of W. B. Otwell, editor of the Otwell’s Farmer Boy, 
Carlinville, Ill., deserves special mention. Mr. Otwell is chiefly 
responsible for the beginning of the state-wide development of 
boys’ corn clubs in Illinois, and had charge of their exhibit at 
the St. Louis Exposition, where 1,250 boys’ exhibits received 
awards. By means of his paper he is interesting a large number 
of boys of the Middle West. He conducted in 1910 a corn con- 
test in which 25,000 boys were competing.® Another feature of 
his boys’ club is an annual encampment for those who can attend, 
for the purpose of agricultural study. 
In order to give description in sufficient detail, the foregoing 
discussion of boys’ agricultural clubs has been limited to a few 
typical examples of what is now actually being accomplished. 
References have been made from time to time to the public inter- 
est in the clubs and to their influence upon the public schools. 
It was the intention in preparation of this chapter to include 
a fuller discussion of the relation of this movement to rural 
education than space will permit. Opinions have been gathered 
from a number of state superintendents, and from others in- 
terested in rural education as to the reaction of the agricultural 
club movement upon the rural schools. These opinions are well 
summed up in the following: 
Keeps boys in school longer; gives teacher greater influence and power; 
convinces farmers that school people want to and can be useful to the 
5 Otwell’s Farmer Boy, Carlinville, Ill., December, 1910.

farming interests, and tends to make the school the center of community 
life; stirs farmers to greater endeavor and to better methods of farming, and 
increases general interest in agriculture and returns. 
Perhaps the most important contribution that these clubs are 
now making to agricultural education in the public schools is 
the recognition by the patrons of the direct value in dollars 
and cents that such instruction has, a recognition which will lead 
to better support of the schools by the community and greater 
interest in them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
CHAPTER XIII 
ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
One of the most important recent tendencies in education is 
the redirection of schools of a community in terms of the daily 
welfare of its people. For a rural community such redirection 
must be largely in terms of agriculture and of other country- 
life interests. It is for this reason that so much emphasis is 
placed upon agriculture as a means of increasing the efficiency 
of rural schools. 
When this idea began to express itself in practice in rural 
communities the elementary school was the first to receive at- 
tention. But age of pupils, many grades in one room, lack of 
properly qualified teachers, and various other limitations have 
led many to doubt the wisdom of this selection. The results 
of introducing agriculture as a school subject into the elementary 
schools have thus far not been entirely satisfactory. Neverthe- 
less adjustments are taking place, so that agriculture, not as 
a systematized subject of instruction but in certain of its nature- 
study aspects, will no doubt find an important place. About 
all that may reasonably be expected of agriculture in the ele- 
mentary schools is to interest the children in country-life sub- 
jects so that they may know the common birds, insects, trees, 
weeds; the meaning of some of the best farm practices, such 
as selecting and testing seed, how the soil holds water and means 
of preventing its loss, care of milk and value of its fat content, 
etc.; and through such studies to lead the children to appreciate 
the fact that there is something worth while in the immediate 
world in which they live. 
The rural high school is now being recognized as the best 
place below the college for instruction in agriculture. Such 
a high school is closely related to rural education in two ways: 
one in the adjustment of its own work to the industrial and 
115  
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
social needs of its community, the other in giving its graduates 
who expect to teach in rural elementary schools some prepara- 
tion for teaching country-life subjects. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
The introduction of agricultural subjects into elementary 
schools has proceeded mainly along two lines—one as a result 
of legislation, the other as a natural outgrowth of boys’ agri- 
cultural clubs. 
In many places in states where agriculture is a required 
subject for instruction in rural schools no such legislation was 
really needed, for the subject was already being introduced in 
a sane and effective way, and was being made use of as far as 
the experience of the teacher and conditions of the school en- 
vironment would permit. 
The results of compulsory teaching of agriculture in the ele- 
mentary schools have been twofold: first, in stimulating those 
in charge of the administration to provide helps to those teach- 
ers who are expected to carry out the provisions of the law; 
second, in the production and use of textbooks on elementary 
agriculture. The first has been done through bulletins, teachers’ 
leaflets, institute instruction, summer normal schools, and in vari- 
ous other ways. Some agricultural colleges have been called upon 
to give attention to elementary education sooner than they other- 
wise would. They have been forced to study the rural-school 
situation and devise means for improving it. The work of state 
offices of education and of agricultural colleges in promoting 
agricultural education in rural communities has already been 
considered somewhat in detail in previous chapters. But the con- 
tributions of these two agencies to agricultural education in 
elementary schools must not be ascribed wholly to legislation, for 
in several states having no requirements as to teaching of agri- 
culture both state departments of education and agricultural 
colleges have done excellent service in providing helps for 
teachers wishing to introduce the subject in their schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS 117 
The second result has been less satisfactory. Indeed, in 
some instances it has proved a positive detriment to agricultural 
education. It has in effect added another textbook subject to 
an already crowded rural-school curriculum, for many teachers, 
in spite of whatever suggestions they may receive from leaflets 
or institute instruction, know of no other way to teach except 
by means of a textbook. It has put undue emphasis on the 
agricultural textbook. More than a score of elementary text- 
books have appeared within a decade. Publishers have been 
very active in securing the use of their books in the rural 
schools. While the value of a good textbook must be con- 
ceded, it is apt to be the means of substituting agricultural in- 
formation for real agricultural instruction. The kind of agri- 
cultural instruction best adapted for the elementary schools 
cannot be given merely by means of recitations from a text- 
book. 
There may be some justification in making the teaching of a 
subject compulsory on the ground that otherwise it would never 
be taught. On the other hand it may seriously be questioned, 
since the whole burden of such a measure falls upon the teach- 
ers, whether efficient teaching of any subject may be secured by 
mandatory legislation. The length of teaching service of the 
average rural teacher is very short, perhaps less than three 
years. As a result rural teachers are constantly being recruited 
from the young graduates of grammar and high schools. It is 
claimed by some that whatever preparation these inexperienced 
teachers may make is largely determined by what they are ex- 
pected to teach. If they must teach agriculture they will make 
some effort to prepare themselves to teach this subject. It 
is probably on this theory that so many states have tried this 
plan of introducing agriculture into the rural schools. At 
least sixteen states have tried this plan, and in several other states 
bills providing for such instruction were considered by legislatures 
last in session, and one (in Ohio) became a law. 
The second line of development of agricultural education 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
in elementary schools has produced a much better type of in- 
struction than the former or mandatory method. This is partly 
because the results of boys’ clubs have shown the value of agri- 
culture as a school subject, and have thus secured for it public 
approval and support, and partly because experience in man- 
aging these clubs has given the teachers some insight into 
methods of adapting the subject to the needs of the school, and 
of making it an effective part of the regular school work. 
Teachers who have been the most successful are those who 
have selected agricultural subjects of special interest to the 
school community, and who have used methods calling for self- 
activity on the part of the pupils—having the pupils learn by 
doing rather than by reciting. The following is a list of various 
kinds of work reported to be successfully adapted to rural 
schools (147): experimental plots for plant breeding, soil in- 
oculation, and other soil experiments; ear-to-row method of 
improving corn, and use of acre plots; seed germinating includ- 
ing tests of viability; collection of economic plants, weeds, weed- 
seed, and insects; budding, grafting, pruning, and spraying 
fruit trees; milk testing with Babcock milk tester. 
The importance attached by pupils and patrons to such work 
is well illustrated by the following report. In one county in 
Iowa it is the practice for each school to have in the spring a 
germinating test for corn. One teacher says of this work: 
My boys who would not go across the road for a song book went two 
miles in the snow to get some sawdust for a germinating box. When the 
corn had germinated, the farmers came to the schoolhouse to see how their 
corn had turned out, and incidentally saw the work of the school. Why, 
farmers came who couldn’t remember when they had been inside the school- 
house before! (148, p. 18). 
The rural school is badly in need of redirection, but it will 
take more than the teaching of agriculture to bring this about. 
However, some sort of nature-study agriculture that has ele- 
ments of interest to pupils and parents alike may do much 
toward putting the rural school in the way of redirection. Here 
and there are promises of the fulfilment of L. H. Bailey’s vi-
-P-A-G-E-127
ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS IIQ 
sion of a rural school living up to its possibilities. Referring 
to the kind of agricultural studies suggested in the above report, 
he says: 
All such teaching as this will call for a new purpose in the school build- 
ing. The present country-school building is a structure in which children 
sit to study books and recite from them. It should also be a place in which 
the children can work with their hands. Every school building should have 
a laboratory room, in which there may be a few plants growing in the win- 
dows, and perhaps an aquarium and terrarium. Here the children will bring 
flowers and insects and samples of soil, and varieties of corn or cotton in 
their season, and other objects that interest them, and here they may perform 
their simple work with tools. Even if the teacher cannot teach these sub- 
jects, the room itself will teach. The mere bringing of such objects would 
have a tremendous influence on children: patrons would ask what the room 
is for; in time a teacher would be found who could handle the subject peda- 
gogically. Now we see children carrying only books to school; some day 
they will also carry twigs and potatoes and animals and tools and contrivances 
and other personal objects (122). 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
Previous to 1906 there were but few high schools (except- 
ing agricultural high schools) giving instruction in agriculture ; 
in 1906-7 there were 75-80; in 1907-8, 240-50; in 1908-9, 
over 500; in 1909-10, probably 1,000; in 1910-11, incomplete 
data indicate as many as 1,500. The number of agricultural 
high schools (those giving two or more years of agricultural 
instruction) in 1909 was 125; in 1910, 144. Of these there 
were receiving local support, in 1909, 24; in 1910, 33; receiv- 
ing state aid in 1909, 29; in I910, 39; technical schools giving 
agricultural instruction in 1909, 37; in 1910, 47; connected with 
agricultural colleges in 1909, 34; in 1910, 35 (149, pp. 333-35; 
150, pp. 23-25). 
Secondary agricultural education has developed along sev- 
eral lines, giving rise to as many as eight more or less distinct 
types, viz. (@) agricultural-college, (b) district, (c) county, 
(d) village-township, (e) city, (f) state aid, (g) technical, (A) 
normal.t 
* The first four types of this classification are suggested by G. A. Bricker in his Teaching 
of Agricultural in the High School, chap. ii (151).
-P-A-G-E-128
    120 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The agricultural-college type is well illustrated by the School 
of Agriculture of the University of Minnesota. This school 
has the distinction of being one of the first secondary schools 
of agriculture. It was 
organized in 1888 with the object of giving practical education to young 
men and women who are unable to pursue the full college course in agri- 
culture. It offers a practical course of study designed to fit young men and 
women for successful farm life, and aims to give its students the necessary 
preparation for useful citizenship (152, p. 8). 
The district type is found in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, 
Oklahoma, and Virginia. The districts in each of these states ex- 
cept Oklahoma correspond to the several congressional dis- 
tricts. The objects of all these schools are similar and are 
summed up in the following statement concerning the Alabama 
District Agricultural Schools which were the first of this type 
of schools to be established : 
To turn out young men well grounded in the underlying principles of 
scientific and practical agriculture, that they may make successful planters 
and advance the farming interests of the state. 
To give such instruction and training as will fix in the minds of the 
young men high ideals of country-life education, as is done in the best agri- 
cultural high schools under the name of “agriculture and home economics.” 
To educate and fully equip young men and women for efficient teaching 
in the public schools of the state. 
To prepare those who desire to enter higher institutions of learning 
(153, p. 15)? 
The establishment of county agricultural high schools is now 
authorized in at least twenty-three states. In many of these 
states such schools receive state aid. The county schools of 
Wisconsin are the oldest and best known. In the Wisconsin 
schools 
the courses are two years in length and include subjects of general agricul- 
ture; biology and physical subjects; laboratory and field and shop work; 
domestic science, home economy, and hygiene; sewing and millinery; farm 
management and accounts, besides courses in English, history, civics, and 
other branches of the usual high-school type (151, p. 23).

  ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS 121 
The Baltimore County (Md.) Agricultural High School 
presents some features that deserve special mention: 
The school is meant especially to meet the needs of a rural community. 
It presents all the usual subjects taught in high schools, except foreign 
languages, and in addition teaches agriculture, domestic science, and manual 
training. It is thus planned that students graduating from this school will, 
in addition to a good general or academic education, have some industrial 
or vocational training to fit them to take their places in the world (155, p. 1). 
The principal, who is a specialist in agriculture, devotes the en- 
tire year to the school, spending the usual summer vacation in 
the interests of the school, inspecting and directing the work of 
the pupils who are carrying out in a practical way experiments 
and problems outlined during the school year. In this manner 
the principles of agriculture taught in the school are carried 
over into practice under normal farming conditions. In addi- 
tion to offering excellent instruction in agriculture and in other 
subjects, the school further serves the community by giving 
courses for rural school teachers and for farmers and their 
wives, and by furnishing a center for religious service and literary 
and social activities for the young people (156). 
Most of the high schools giving instruction in agriculture 
are of the village-township type. The work of two of these 
high schools which were among the first to make agriculture 
a subject of instruction has already been referred to in chap. 
vii. The motive for reorganizing rural village and township 
high schools on the basis of country-life interests is well ex- 
pressed tin an account of the New Holland (Ohio) High School: 
The larger percentage of the boys and girls who are enrolled in the village 
and township high schools of this state will spend their lives either in the 
rural districts or villages where farm life and agricultural industries are the 
leading interests. They will be either farmers or farmers’ wives, or they 
will be engaged in business very intimately connected with agriculture. In 
view of this condition the Board of Education at New Holland, Ohio, has 
placed agriculture in the curriculum of the high school (157, p. 3). 
Another of the earlier schools of this type whose success 
has attracted considerable attention is the John Swaney School, 
Putnam County, Illinois (158). 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
High schools of cities surrounded by agricultural commu- 
nities enrol a large number of pupils from the country. The 
special needs of such pupils have recently been recognized by a 
few city high schools. Thus in the Stockton (Cal.) High School 
a department of agriculture was organized at the beginning of 
the present school year. A director who is an agricultural- 
college graduate, has charge. He is not expected to teach more 
than one-third of his time; the rest of his time is to be devoted 
to the “study of agricultural problems at first hand throughout 
the farm:area tributary to Stockton.” He is to take up any agri- 
cultural problem at any time, go to the farm, and help find a 
solution. By this means the farmer is reached directly and 
made to feel that our school director and teachers are will- 
ing and able to educate boys and girls for profitable farm 
life and to cope with economic problems troublesome and burden- 
some to them. Short courses are also offered to farmers and 
those interested in agriculture who cannot take the full course. 
A course is offered to students who expect to be teachers with 
a view of providing the rural schools with teachers having a 
knowledge of, and an interest in, farm life. Further aid is given 
the rural schools by a series of teachers’ meetings and confer- 
ences with the director in charge (159). - 
The Gardena High School of Los Angeles has been offering 
courses in agriculture with particular reference to horticulture, 
gardening, and poultry raising which are the dominant interests 
of the community (160). The San Diego (Cal.) High School 
has also recently established a department of agriculture some- 
what after the Stockton plan. 
Agriculture in city high schools located in farming re- 
gions offers a very promising field for further development. 
These schools have advantages that compensate somewhat for 
their immediate non-rural surroundings. Their laboratory facili- 
ties are usually very good, and they are able by means of high 
salaries to secure experienced and well-equipped teachers. 
In order to encourage the introduction of agriculture into
-P-A-G-E-131
  ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS 123 
rural high schools some states have offered the inducement of 
state aid to a limited number of schools undertaking this work. 
For example, Minnesota is now giving for this purpose $2,500 
to each of thirty high schools, and $1,000 to each of sixty. 
This method has some advantages over entire local support, 
for it not only makes possible the securing of good teachers 
but provides for a higher standard of efficiency than is likely 
to be secured by a purely local management. (See chaps. iii. 
and iv.) 
The Hinckley State High School which is a good example of 
this type of high school organized in Minnesota offers the 
following courses: literary course, four years; agricultural- 
industrial course, four years; special agricultural course, two 
years; short course for institutes for farmers; normal course 
for rural teachers, one year (161). 
A somewhat different plan of state aid to high schools giv- 
ing instruction in agriculture, mechanic arts, and home-making 
is being worked out in New York. The following extract from 
the educational law of 1910 will indicate the scope of the New 
York plan: 
The Commissioner of Education in the annual apportionment of the state 
school moneys shall apportion therefrom to each city and union free school 
district the sum of $500 for each independently organized general industrial 
school, trade school, or school of agriculture, mechanic arts, and home-making, 
maintained therein for 38 weeks during the school year and employing one 
teacher whose work is devoted exclusively to such school, and having an 
enrolment of at least 25 pupils, and maintaining a course of study approved 
by him. The Commissioner shall also make an additional appropriation to 
each city or union free school district of $200 for each additional teacher em- 
ployed exclusively in such schools for 38 weeks during the school year 
(162, p. 3). 
In order to secure successful operation of this law, the or- 
ganization and general oversight of all schools receiving state 
aid for teaching agriculture are under the direction of the State 
Department of Agricultural Education. The State Department 
of Education has also prepared a very complete series of syllabi 
of courses in agriculture for high schools, From this series it is  
-P-A-G-E-132
  
  124 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
possible for a school to select subjects adapted to the particular 
agricultural interests of the community (163). 
Agriculture in the technical type of secondary schools re- 
ceives much the same attention as in the district type, the chief 
difference being that the latter offers no courses in mechanic 
arts. These schools seem to be patterned after state agricul- 
tural and mechanical colleges, but offering only instruction of 
secondary grade. A good example of this type is the Cali- 
fornia Polytechnic School, which was opened in 1903 at San 
Luis Obispo. This institution is supported by the state, and is 
intended “to furnish to the young people of both sexes mental 
and manual training in arts and sciences, including agriculture, 
mechanical engineering, business methods, domestic economy, 
and such other branches as will fit students for non-professional 
walks of life” (16, p. 22). 
Agricultural education in State Normal Schools has already 
been discussed in chap. vi. Instruction in agriculture in these 
schools is usually of secondary grade but with the special aim 
of preparing teachers. In some of these schools considerable 
emphasis is placed upon agriculture, and work corresponding 
to some of the best agricultural high schools is offered. For 
example, the Cape Girardeau (Mo.) State Normal School has 
a department of agriculture not only for teachers but for 
furnishing “young men from the farm an opportunity of obtain- 
ing the equivalent of a good high-school education of such a 
nature as will fit them to carry on the business of farming 
according to the most approved farm methods” (164, p. 63). 
The development of secondary agricultural instruction has 
proceeded along two lines, one by employing existing high 
schools, the other in organizing separate agricultural high 
schools. The recent tendency as indicated by the statistical sum- 
mary introducing this discussion seems strongly in the direction 
of the former. No doubt there is much to be said in favor of 
separate agricultural high schools to meet conditions in certain 
localities, but taking the country as a whole the natural tendency, 
as above indicated, of maintaining the unity of our present
-P-A-G-E-133
  
ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS 125 
school organization presents obvious advantages which the pub- 
lic has already begun to realize. 
Attention should be given, in this connection, to the fact 
that much misapprehension and undue concern exists as to the 
plan of organization of the agricultural high school. A careful 
analysis of the course of study of the average agricultural high 
school will show less divergence from the plan of the ordinary 
high school than many suppose. It will be found that the 
courses of study are essentially the same in many particulars, 
the chief difference being the substitution of agricultural and 
household-arts subjects for the foreign languages, with perhaps 
more emphasis on the practical side of the sciences and less 
emphasis on certain phases of mathematics (165). 
One real difficulty in making the most of agriculture as a 
school subject lies in the fact that there is little opportunity for 
agricultural practice corresponding to shop practice in mechanic 
arts. The most active season of agricultural work is during the 
summer vacation. This difficulty may be met in the way already 
referred to in the account of the Baltimore County (Md.) Agri- 
cultural High School, where the teacher of agriculture devotes 
the usual summer vacation period to looking after experiments 
being conducted by the pupils. This matter has been carefully 
studied by a special agent of the Massachusetts State Board of 
Education and conclusions submitted to the legislature in the 
form of a Report of the Board of Education on Agricultural 
Education (166). Provision for proper farm practice as 
recommended in this report is secured by part-time work 
in agriculture which may utilize “home land, equipment, and 
time, outside school hours, for practical training supervised 
by the school.” The scheme is worked out in considerable 
detail by means of concrete examples of various ‘farming 
projects” that may be undertaken. Among the major pro- 
jects suggested are caring for a kitchen garden, keeping a pen 
of poultry, caring for a selected part of an orchard, raising a 
specified crop of potatoes, caring for one cow. Each major 
project is broken up into minor projects. For example, keeping 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
a pen of poultry would include as minor projects building a 
poultry house according to plans and specifications worked out 
at school. This in turn is divided into such subordinate minor 
projects as are necessary for successful completion, such as se- 
lecting a site for the house, taking into consideration: soil as 
related to poultry culture, underdrainage, conditions of sunlight 
and shade, convenience of access, etc. The legislation proposed 
by this report was passed by the legislature last in session. 
When the proposed plan goes linto effect, its results should be 
carefully studied by all who are interested in secondary agri- 
cultural education. 
The rapid introduction of agriculture into high schools is 
responsible, in part at least, for two interesting educational re- 
actions. One is the changed attitude of colleges toward agri- 
culture as an entrance unit. A few years ago most colleges 
refused to give any credit for work done in this subject in high 
schools. Now 36 colleges actually recognize the subject and 27 
express a willingness to do so when it is offered as an entrance 
unit, and several other colleges are considering the matter (167). 
The other reaction is upon the method of presenting sec- 
ondary science. There is now a growing tendency to relate sci- 
ence instruction more and more to the practical affairs of life 
(168). Recent experiments seem to justify this method of 
approach to a science even when judged from the point of view of 
pure science (169, 170). 
Agricultural colleges are now well established, and their 
problems are largely matters of detail and of research. The 
problems of agricultural education are now being shifted to the 
secondary schools offering agricultural instruction. There is 
a great diversity, not only in respect to types of schools, but 
also as to methods, time devoted to the subject, equipment, 
qualification of teachers, and in other respects. But of the 
widespread interest there can be no doubt. The results on the 
whole promise much for the development of rural education 
and redirection of rural schools.

  CHAPTER XIV 
TEXTBOOKS 
One striking evidence of the growing interest in agricul- 
tural education in elementary and secondary schools is the num- 
ber of textbooks on agriculture that have appeared in recent 
years.1 Of the seventy-five or more textbooks on this subject 
nearly forty have been published since 1900. 
An excellent account of the textbooks of agriculture, in- 
cluding historical aspects, was written by L. H. Bailey in 1903 
(171). The present discussion will therefore be confined 
chiefly to the textbooks published since 1903. In this period 
of seven years at least twenty-eight textbooks of various kinds 
have been written. Emphasis should be put on various, for the 
diversity of plan and treatment of the subject in these books 
makes it difficult to find a basis of classification. They will 
be considered in this discussion as three types: for elementary 
schools, for secondary schools, and for teachers. 
Most elementary textbooks are informational in character. 
The subject is generally presented in clear and simple language 
easily within the grasp of the pupil. It is assumed that the 
pupil has had sufficient concrete experiences with agricultural 
matters, and that the text will help him to interpret these ex- 
periences. There is a minimum of effort required of the pupil 
to find out things for himself. Questions are often given at 
the end of each chapter, but they are usually merely a summary 
*It is possible that this statement should be qualified, for the number of books published 
does not indicate the number in actual use. A quotation from a private letter written by the 
editor of one of the largest publishing companies of agricultural books is significant: “Outside 
of one textbook published by a Boston house, I do not believe there is another manual of agri- 
culture or agricultural textbook that has paid the publishers anything beyond mere cost, and 
some have not even paid cost.” This was written in 1909. Since then conditions may have 
changed for there has been a great development of interest in the subject. Besides, fourteen 
books have been written during and since 1909. It seems likely that the small demand for 
certain textbooks may be due to the quality of the books themselves. 
127
-P-A-G-E-136
  128 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
of the text, and test the memory rather than ability to interpret. 
Sometimes experiments are introduced, either in the text or 
at the end of chapters. But conclusions to be drawn from these 
experiments are either so implied in the text or are so obvious 
that the suggested experiments become merely concrete examples 
or illustrations of discussion in the text. Books of this kind 
are easily adapted to the prevailing recitation method and con- 
sequently are in extensive use (172). Several books have ap- 
peared in which the experiment predominates. Here problems 
and some suggestions as to procedure are given. The pupil 
is expected to find answers by means of his own investigations. 
He is supposed to learn to find out things for himself. How- 
ever, even in otherwise admirable books, induction is often 
“ready-made for the pupil” (173). This method of teaching 
by means of experiment does not fit in very well with prevailing 
methods of teaching. Many of the teachers themselves have 
not had the benefit of laboratory training, and hence know 
very little of any other than the textbook method of learning 
or teaching. 
Another kind is the one in which agriculture is correlated 
with arithmetic. Problems for demonstration of the various 
arithmetical principles relate to agricultural affairs. In the 
preface of one book occurs the statement, “The pupil will un- 
consciously absorb and retain many valuable facts and prin- 
ciples relating to agricultural practice”; in the preface of 
another, the statement, ““We trust that this little book, by com- 
bining the subjects of arithmetic and agriculture, will be of 
material assistance to teachers in their efforts to do effective 
work in both branches” (177, 193). 
Perhaps one reason for the number of elementary agri- 
cultural textbooks lies in the nature of the subject itself. 
Considered as an industry, agriculture is manufacturing, buying, and sell- 
ing. It is business. But unlike most other businesses, the operator is pro- 
ducer of the raw material as well as dealer in the products. In order to 
produce his wares to the best advantage he must know much of the princi- 
ples in accordance with which the most successful production must proceed.
-P-A-G-E-137
  TEXTBOOKS 129 
In other words, he must know much of the sciences on which agriculture is 
based, as physics, chemistry, botany, and other sciences. But he should never 
forget that the practice of agriculture is an art and not a science. 
These remarks will suggest why it is that there is such a bewildering 
diversity in plan in the various textbooks of agriculture. One reason why 
these textbooks have not been more successful in accomplishing the missions 
for which they are designed is the fact that they look upon agriculture from 
the academic point of view rather than from the agricultural. Another reason 
is the attempt to make them “practical” by inserting specific directions for 
the performing of accustomed farm operations; for these directions must 
necessarily be of local and temporary application, whereas principles are 
general and abiding (171, p. 690). 
Considered from the standpoint of scientific accuracy most 
of these textbooks are good, but in some there are inaccurate 
data, or statements at variance with well-established facts. Con- 
sidered from the standpoint of pedagogy most of these texts 
are lacking. The matter is often presented with little or no 
reference to this important aspect of a textbook. Indeed, some 
are barely more than abridged encyclopedias of agricultural 
information. This general defect may possibly be accounted 
for when we consider the fact that the authors of all these 
books, with a few exceptions, are college professors, whose 
chief interest is in the subject-matter with apparently little in- 
terest in organizing material from a teaching standpoint, and 
giving no recognition to the social possibilities of their subject. 
It is probable that the most useful book, at least for the present, will 
be one that attempts at the same time to awaken an interest in country life 
and to set the pupil at the working out of specific problems. Mere problems 
are too “dry” to attract pupils, except now and then under the inspiration 
of an extra good teacher. On the other hand, mere information-giving has 
little teaching value and is not likely to arouse any important enthusiasm for 
the open country and the farm. On account of the diversity of interests to 
be served, no single textbook of agriculture can hope to have great leadership 
in all parts of the country. The thoroughly satisfactory text is apparently 
yet to be written (122). 
The purpose of an agricultural textbook for secondary 
schools is well expressed in the preface of a recent book of this 
grade: “to make the teaching of agriculture in existing high
-P-A-G-E-138
  
  130 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
schools comparable in extent and thoroughness with the teach- 
ing of physics, mathematics, history, and literature.’ Although 
some of the elementary textbooks already referred to are being 
used to some extent in high schools there are only five books 
known to the writer that measure up to the standard just quoted. 
No two of these follow the same plan of treatment. In one 
laboratory work largely predominates; in another good labora- 
tory exercises follow each chapter; in another some experi- 
ments are suggested in the text and among the questions at the 
end of the chapters; in two no laboratory exercises are sug- 
gested except in a general way in the text (176, 190, 195, 197, 
200). These are all well written, and where one is used as a 
textbook the others could be used to advantage as reference 
books. For a detailed comparison of these textbooks the bibli- 
ography should be consulted. 
There are three other books which properly belong among 
secondary textbooks of agriculture but which do not cover the 
entire subject. “There are those who believe that when agri- 
culture is fully introduced as a secondary subject, it will con- 
sist, as in college, not of one but of several courses, each with 
its distinct and separate text.” One of these is a laboratory 
manual dealing with soils and crops (198); the other two are 
textbooks, one dealing with fertility of the soil, the other with 
plant and animal improvement (184, 196). 
A third type includes books for teachers. These books deal 
with the subject from the standpoint of teaching. Five are 
for teachers in elementary schools (185, 187, 189, 194, 199), 
and one is for teachers in secondary schools (151). Not much 
attention has yet been given to the teaching problems of the 
subject of agriculture, but they are quite as important as the 
subject-matter. 
Referring to elementary agricultural textbooks, L. H. Bailey 
says: “Efforts enough have been made, but they have fallen 
short of anticipations. Before textbooks we need teachers; 
and we must appeal to the child through his interest in nature
-P-A-G-E-139
TEXTBOOKS 131 
rather than technically in the farm” (171, p. 696). Elementary 
textbooks are not nearly so important as elementary teachers. 
It is to the new teachers who are to have at least a high-school 
education that we must look to carry agricultural education into 
the rural elementary schools. It is for this reason that addi- 
tional importance is to be attached to instruction in agriculture 
and country-life subjects in rural high schools. A good text- 
book with well-selected experiments, although alone not suffi- 
cient, is, nevertheless, quite essential to any general introduction 
and efficient instruction in these high schools. 
As this discussion of textbooks of agriculture is really sup- 
plementary to one already made by L. H. Bailey (171), his plan 
of chronological bibliography, with annotations as to contents, 
will be followed. His article and this chapter, including refer- 
ences 151 and 172--202, inclusive, will thus bring the subject up 
to date.

The titles are arranged in order of citation in the various chapters of the 
text, except numbers 174 to 202. These are arranged in chronological order as 
in L. H. Bailey’s bibliography in his Development of the Textbook of Agriculture 
in North America (171), the two lists making an almost complete bibliography 
of North American textbooks of agriculture up to the present. 
The bibliography has been selected with the view of presenting typical 
contributions on various phases of agricultural education in elementary and 
secondary schools. No attempt has been made to make it complete.

After a general discussion of rural education, its needs and short- 
comings, the author gives an account of the program for rural educational 
reform,’ known as the Macdonald Consolidated Rural School Movement, 
which was to take effect in Canada the following September. A large num- 
ber of interesting facts are given not only concerning this proposed reform 
but also concerning the agricultural work in general in Canada.

tion along such lines? Both questions are answered, the first by making 
use of pupils’ everyday experiences, the second through training schools 
for teachers.

Some of the plans of the Craftsman Farms are set forth. Active farm 
operation is regarded as the first step in creating an ideal school environ- 
ment. “To use the idea of education seems as big and interesting as 
the whole of life itself. And the farm work which is necessary to make 
the land productive for our own maintenance and also to make the 
ground attractive to the eye seems to us to afford a series of experiments, 
the educational value of which no scientific laboratory could equal.”

The purpose of this paper is to “emphasize the advisability” of extend-

and made to subserve the economic interest of man. This will not kill the 
cultural school but foster it. The man who wants to be a lawyer or a 
doctor or a teacher or a journalist will have a hundred opportunities where 
he now has one.”

C. H. Roptson. Teachers College, Columbia University (1910), 205. 
This book deals with the present status of agricultural education in 
the secondary schools of the United States. The chapter headings are as 
follows: “The Public High School”; “Some Types of High Schools”; 
“Special Secondary Schools of Agriculture’; “Problems of Agricultural 
Instruction in the Secondary Schools.” Two appendices, one on legislation, 
the other giving a very complete list of references, are added. This is a 
valuable reference book on agricultural education bringing together, as it 
does, an immense amount of data hitherto inaccessible. 
The Teaching of Agriculture in the High School. G. A. BRICKER. New 
York: Macmillan (1911). XXYV, 202. 
The subject is considered from a teaching standpoint in the following 
chapters: “Nature of Secondary Agriculture”; “Rise and Development of 
Secondary Education in Agriculture in the United States”; ‘Social Results” ; 
“As a Separate Science’; ‘Psychological Determination of Sequence”; 
“Seasonal Determination of Sequence’; “Organization of the Course”; 
“Aims and Methods of Presentation”; “Organization of the Laboratory and 
Field Work” ; “Illustrative List of Classified Exercises”; “Educational Aims, 
Values, and Ideals.” This is the first attempt to present in detail the prob- 
lems of secondary agriculture from the point of view of instruction.

with special reference to correlation with reading, arithmetic, geography, etc. 
Agriculture in the Public Schools. LESTER S.Ivins. Lebanon, O.: March 
Bros. (1909), 156. 
This is a handbook for teachers. It includes suggestions for organiza- 
tion of rural schools, teaching of nature-study and agriculture in rural 
schools, plans for conducting parents’ meetings, public displays of school 
work, corn, potato, and vegetable growing contests, home, rural, and city-

helpful to the teacher. 
Elements of Agriculture. G.¥. Warren. New York: Macmillan (1909), 
xxiv+434. 
“This book is intended for use in high schools, academies, and normal 
schools, and in colleges when only a short time can be given to the subject.” 
The author has attempted to carry out the suggestions of the Committee on 
Instruction in Agriculture of the Association of American Colleges and 
Experiment Stations. All important phases of agriculture are discussed 
in the eighteen chapters that make up the body of the book. The text of 
each chapter is followed by questions, laboratory exercises, and collateral 
reading. A summary of chap. v, “The Soil,” will illustrate the method of 
treatment which is typical of each chapter: What Soil Is; Rock Particles 
of the Soil; Soil Water, Including Irrigation and Drainage; Soil Air; Or- 
ganic Matter of the Soil; Life in the Soil. The chapter is reviewed by 
means of twenty-four questions. The following is typical: “Where does a 
fence post rot most rapidly? Why?” Fifteen excellent laboratory and field 
exercises give concreteness to the text. Ten references are given in the 
Collateral reading. There are twenty pages of appendix containing informa- 
tion useful to teacher and pupil. 
Elementary Principles of Agriculture. A.M. FErcuson and L. L. Lewis. 
Sherman, Tex.: Ferguson Publishing Co. (1909), xvi+318. 
The aim of the book is perhaps best expressed by the authors: “Our 
own ideas are that the primary object of a text on agriculture, intended for 
the common schools, is to satisfy the natural interest of all children about 
the whys of common farm conditions.” 
The book is in three parts: Part I, deals with the plant, soil diseases of 
plants, injurious insects, etc.; Part II, with animals, including dairying; 
Part III, is devoted to special topics, such as home lot, school gardens, for- 
estry, etc. There is an Appendix of nine parts, including references, formu- 
lae for sprays, tables of nutrients, rainfall, etc.

“Every subject in this book is written by an expert in his line. This 
idea was carried out in order to furnish the student with the best informa- 
tion that could be obtained. The editor thought it would be better to have 
authorities treat of the various topics rather than write the book alone, as 
there are very few men competent enough to warrant their writing the best 
book on agriculture.” Thirty-three experts in various fields of agriculture 
have contributed.

The aim of the book is “to touch those matters which would be most 
useful to the pupils in our rural schools, and especially to give the under- 
lying theory for many farm processes and practices.’ There are twenty- 
one chapters and an Appendix. All of the usual subjects of agriculture 
are covered in these chapters, and the Appendix contains references and a 
number of useful tables.

“This book is designed for the purpose of introducing the study of 
agriculture into the seventh and eighth grades of our elementary schools. 
The book is founded on the suggestions in the Report of the Committee 
on Industrial Education in Schools for Rural Communities of the National 
Education Association. It has been the aim of the author to cover the 
work very largely in a nature-study spirit, by which it is meant that the 
pupil shall be brought into as close touch as possible with the actual 
farms, soils, crops, animals and affairs.’ There are four parts: I, The 
Affairs of Agriculture, eight chapters; II, The Soil, seven chapters; III, 
Farm Plants, sixteen chapters; IV, Farm Animals, ten chapters. Each 
chapter is followed by a series of problems dealing concretely with various 
phases of the subject in text. There are two hundred and forty-one such 
problems in the book.

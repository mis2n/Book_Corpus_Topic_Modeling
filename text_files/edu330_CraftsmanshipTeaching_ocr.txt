PREFACE 
The following papers are published chiefly because they 
treat in a concrete and personal manner some of the prin- 
ciples which the writer has developed in two previously 
published books, The Educative Process and Classroom 
Management, and in a forthcoming volume, Educational 
Values. It is hoped that the more informal discussions 
presented in the following pages will, in some slight 
measure, supplement the theoretical and systematic 
treatment which necessarily characterizes the other 
books. In this connection, it should be stated that the 
materials of the first paper here presented were drawn 
upon in writing Chapter XVIII of Classroom Manage- 
ment, and that the second paper simply states in a dif- 
ferent form the conclusions reached in Chapter I of 
The Educative Process. 
The writer is indebted to his colleague, Professor L. F. 
Anderson, for many criticisms and suggestions and to 
Miss Bernice Harrison for invaluable aid in editing 
the papers for publication. But his heaviest debt, here 
as elsewhere, is to his wife, to whose encouraging sym- 
pathy and inspiration whatever may be valuable in this 
or in his other books must be largely attributed.

“Tn the laboratory of life, each newcomer repeats the old experi- 
ments, and laughs and weeps for himself. We will be explorers, 
though all the highways have their guideposts and every bypath 
is mapped. Helen of Troy will not deter us, nor the wounds of 
Cesar frighten, nor the voice of the king crying ‘Vanity!’ from 
his throne dismay. What wonder that the stars that once sang for 
joy are dumb and the constellations go down in silence.”” — ARTHUR 
SHERBURNE Harpy: The Wind of Destiny. 
WE tend, I think, to look upon the advice that we give 
to young people as something that shall disillusionize 
them. The cynic of forty sneers at what he terms the 
platitudes of commencement addresses. He knows life. 
He has been behind the curtains. He has looked upon 
the other side of the scenery, — the side that is just frame- 
work and bare canvas. He has seen the ugly machinery 
that shifts the stage setting — the stage setting which 
appears so impressive when viewed from the front. He 
has seen the rouge on the cheeks that seem to blush with

Normal School, February, 1907.

the bloom of youth and beauty and innocence, and has 
caught the cold glint in the eyes that, from the distance, 
seem to languish with tenderness and love. Why, he asks, 
should we create an illusion that must thus be rudely 
dispelled? Why revamp and refurbish the old platitudes 
and dole them out each succeeding year? Why not tell 
these young people the truth and let them be prepared for 
the fate that must come sooner or later? 
But the cynic forgets that there are some people who 
never lose their illusions, — some men and women who 
are always young, — and, whatever may be the type of 
men and women that other callings and professions desire 
to enroll in their service, this is the type that education 
needs. The great problem of the teacher is to keep him- 
self in this class, to keep himself young, to preserve the 
very things that the cynic pleases to call the illusions of 
his youth. And so much do I desire to impress these 
novitiates into our calling with the necessity for preserv- 
ing their ideals that I shall ask them this evening to 
consider with me some things which would, I fear, strike 
the cynic as most illusionary and impractical. The ini- 
tiation ceremonies that admitted the young man to the 
privileges and duties of knighthood included the taking 
of certain vows, the making of certain pledges of devotion 
and fidelity to the fundamental principles for which chiv- 
alry stood. And I should like this evening to imagine 
that these graduates are undergoing an analogous initia- 
tion into the privileges and duties of schoolcraft, and
-P-A-G-E-13
CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 3 
  that these vows which I shall enumerate, embody some 
of the ideals that govern the work of that craft. 
I 
And the first of these vows I shall call, for want of a 
better term, the vow of “artistry,” — the pledge that the 
initiate takes to do the work that his hand finds to doin 
the best possible manner, without reference to the effort 
that it may cost or to the reward that it may or may not 
bring. 
I call this the vow of artistry because it represents the 
essential attitude of the artist toward his work. The 
cynic tells us that ideals are illusions of youth, and yet, 
the other day I saw expressed in a middle-aged working- 
  man a type of idealism that is not at all uncommon in this 
world. He wasa house painter; his task was simply the 
prosaic job of painting a door; and yet, from the pains 
which he took with that work, an observer would have 
concluded that it was, to the painter, the most important 
task in the world. And that, after all, is the true test of 
craft artistry: to the true craftsman the work that he is 
doing must be the most important thing that can be done. 
One of the best teachers that I know is that kind of a 
craftsman in education. A student was once sent to 
observe his work. He was giving a lesson upon the “‘at- 
tribute complement” to an eighth-grade grammar class. 
I asked the student afterward what she had got from her 
visit. ‘“Why,” she replied, ‘that man taught as if the
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
very greatest achievement in life would be to get his 
pupils to understand the attribute complement, — and 
when he had finished, they did understand it.” 
In a narrower sense, this vow of artistry carries with 
it an appreciation of the value of technique. From the 
very fact of their normal school training, these graduates 
already possess a certain measure of skill, a certain 
mastery of the technique of their craft. This initial 
mastery has been gained in actual contact with the 
problems of school work in their practice teaching. 
They have learned some of the rudiments; they have 
met and mastered some of the rougher, cruder difficul- 
ties. The finer skill, the delicate and intangible points 
of technique, they must acquire, as all beginners must 
acquire them, through the strenuous processes of self- 
discipline in the actual work of the years that are to 
come. This is a process that takes time, energy, con- 
stant and persistent application. All that this school 
or any school can do for its students in this respect is 
to start them upon the right track in the acquisition 
of skill. But do not make the mistake of assuming 
that this is a small and unimportant matter. If this 
school did nothing more than this, it would still repay 
tenfold the cost of its establishment and maintenance. 
Three fourths of the failures in a world that sometimes 
seems full of failures are due to nothing more nor less 
than a wrong start. In spite of the growth of profes- 
sional training for teachers within the past fifty years,
-P-A-G-E-15
CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 5 
  many of our lower schools are still filled with raw recruits, 
fresh from the high schools and even from the grades, 
who must learn every practical lesson of teaching through 
the medium of their own mistakes. Even if this were 
all, the process would involve a tremendous and un- 
called-for waste. But this is not all; for, out of this 
multitude of untrained teachers, only a small propor- 
tion ever recognize the mistakes that they make and try 
to correct them. 
To you who are beginning the work of life, the mastery 
of technique may seem a comparatively unimportant 
matter. You recognize its necessity, of course, but 
you think of it as something of a mechanical nature, 
—an integral part of the day’s work, but uninviting in 
itself, — something to be reduced as rapidly as possible 
to the plane of automatism and dismissed from the 
mind. I believe that you will outgrow this notion. 
As you go on with your work, as you increase in skill, 
ever and ever the fascination of its technique will take 
a stronger and stronger hold upon you: This is the 
great saving principle of our workaday life. This is 
the factor that keeps the toiler free from the deadening 
effects of mechanical routine. It is the factor that 
keeps the farmer at his plow, the artisan at his bench, 
the lawyer at his desk, the artist at his palette. 
I once worked for a man who had accumulated a 
large fortune. At the age of seventy-five he divided 
this fortune among his children, intending to retire;
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
but he could find pleasure and comfort only in the 
routine of business. In six months he was back in his 
office. He borrowed twenty-five thousand dollars on 
his past reputation and started in to have some fun. I 
was his only employee at the time, and I sat across the 
big double desk from him, writing his letters and keep- 
ing his accounts. He would sit for hours, planning for 
the establishment of some industry or running out the 
lines that would entangle some old adversary. I did 
not stay with him very long, but before I left, he had a 
half-dozen thriving industries on his hands, and when 
he died three years later he had accumulated another . 
fortune of over a million dollars. 
That is an example of what I mean by the fascina- 
tion that the technique of one’s craft may come to 
possess. It is the joy of doing well the work that you 
know how to do. The finer points of technique, — 
those little things that seem so trivial in themselves 
and yet which mean everything to skill and efficiency, 
—what pride the competent artisan or the master 
artist takes in these! How he delights to revel in the 
jargon of his craft! How he prides himself in possessing 
the knowledge and the technical skill that are denied the 
layman ! 
I am aware that I am somewhat unorthodox in urg- 
ing this view of your work upon you. Teachers have 
been encouraged to believe that details are not only 
unimportant but stultifying, — that teaching ability is
-P-A-G-E-17
x CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 7 
a function of personality, and not a product of a tech- 
nique that must be acquired through the strenuous 
discipline of experience. One of the most skillful 
teachers of my acquaintance is a woman down in the 
grades. I have watched her work for days at a time, 
striving to learn its secret. I can find nothing there 
that is due to genius, — unless we accept George Eliot’s 
definition of genius as an infinite capacity for receiving 
discipline. That teacher’s success, by her own state- 
ment, is due to a mastery of technique, gained through 
successive years of growth checked by a rigid respon- 
sibility for results. She has found out by repeated trial 
how to do her work in the best way; she has discovered 
the attitude toward her pupils that will get the best 
work from them, — the clearest methods of presenting 
subject matter; the most effective ways in which to 
drill; how to use text-books and make study periods 
issue in something besides mischief; and, -more than all 
else, how to do these things without losing sight of the 
true end of education. Very frequently I have taken 
visiting school men to see this teacher’s work. Invari- 
ably after leaving her room they have turned to me 
with such expressions as these: ‘A born teacher!” 
“What interest!” ‘What a personality!” ‘What a 
voice !”” — everything, in fact, except this, — which 
would have been the truth: “What a tribute to years 
of effort and struggle and self-discipline !” 
I have a theory which I have never exploited very
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
seriously, but I will give it to you for what it is worth. 
It is this: elementary education especially needs a 
literary interpretation. It needs a literary artist who 
will portray to the public in the form of fiction the real 
life of the elementary school, — who will idealize the 
technique of teaching as Kipling idealized the technique 
of the marine engineer, as Balzac idealized the technique 
of the journalist, as Du Maurier and a hundred other 
novelists have idealized the technique of the artist. We 
need some one to exploit our shop-talk on the reading 
public, and to show up our work as you and I know it, 
not as you and I have been told by laymen that it ought 
to be, —a literature of the elementary school with the 
cant and the platitudes and the goody-goodyism left 
out, and in their place something of the virility, of the 
serious study, of the manful effort to solve difficult 
problems, of the real and vital achievements that are 
characteristic of thousands of elementary schools through- 
out the country to-day. 
At first you will be fascinated by the novelty of your 
work. But that soon passes away. Then comes the 
struggle, — then comes the period, be it long or short, 
when you will work with your eyes upon the clock, 
when you will count the weeks, the days, the hours, 
the minutes that lie between you and vacation time. 
Then will be the need for all the strength and all the 
energy that you can summon to your aid. Fail here, 
and your fate is decided once and for all. If, in your
-P-A-G-E-19
  CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 9 
work, you never get beyond this stage, you will never 
become the true craftsman. You will never taste the 
joy that is vouchsafed the expert, the efficient crafts- 
man. 
The length of this period varies with different indi- 
viduals. Some teachers “find themselves” quickly. 
They seem to settle at once into the teaching attitude. 
With others is a long, uphill fight. But it is safe to 
say that if, at the end of three years, your eyes still 
habitually seek the clock, — if, at the end of that time, 
your chief reward is the check that comes at the end of 
every fourth week, — then your doom is sealed. 
Tir 
And the second vow that I should urge these gradu- 
ates to take is the vow of fidelity to the spirit of their 
calling. We have heard a great deal in recent years 
about making education a profession. I do not like 
that term myself. Education is not a profession in the 
sense that medicine and law are professions. It is 
rather a craft, for its duty is to produce, to mold, to 
fashion, to transform a certain raw material into a use- 
ful product. And, like all crafts, education must 
possess the craft spirit. It must have a certain code of 
craft ethics; it must have certain standards of craft 
excellence and efficiency. And in these the normal 
school must instruct its students, and to these it should 
secure their pledge of loyalty and fidelity and devotion.
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
A true conception of this craft spirit in education is 
one of the most priceless possessions of the young teacher, 
for it will fortify him against every criticism to which 
his calling is subjected. It is revealing no secret to tell 
you that the teacher’s work is not held in the highest 
regard by the vast majority of men and women in other 
walks of life. I shall not stop to inquire why this is so, 
but the fact cannot be doubted, and every now and 
again some incident of life, trifling perhaps in itself, 
will bring it to your notice; but most ofall, perhaps 
you will be vexed and incensed by the very thing that 
is meant to put you at your ease — the patronizing 
attitude which your friends in other walks of life will 
assume toward you and toward your work. 
When will the good public cease to insult the teacher’s 
calling with empty flattery? When will men who 
would never for a moment encourage their own sons 
to enter the work of the public schools, cease to tell us 
that education is the greatest and noblest of all human 
callings? Education does not need these compliments. 
The teacher does not need them. If he is a master of 
his craft, he knows what education means, — he knows 
this far better than any layman can tell him. And 
what boots it to him, if, with all this cant and hypocrisy 
about the dignity and worth of his calling, he can some- 
times hold his position only at the sacrifice of his self- 
respect ? 
But what is the relation of the craft spirit to these
-P-A-G-E-21
  CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING II 
facts? Simply this: the true craftsman, by the very 
fact that he is a true craftsman, is immune to these 
influences. What does the true artist care for the plau- 
dits or the sneers of the crowd? True, he seeks com- 
mendation and welcomes applause, for your real artist 
is usually extremely human; but he seeks this com- 
mendation from another source — from a source that 
metes it out less lavishly and yet with unconditioned 
candor. He seeks the commendation of his fellow- 
workmen, the applause of “those who know, and always 
will know, and always will understand.” He plays to 
the pit and not to the gallery, for he knows that when 
the pit really approves the gallery will often echo and 
reécho the applause, albeit it has not the slightest con- 
ception of what the whole thing is about. 
What education stands in need of to-day is just this: 
a stimulating and pervasive craft spirit. If a human 
calling would win the world’s respect, it must first 
respect itself ; and the more thoroughly it respects itself, 
the greater will be the measure of homage that the 
world accords it. In one of the educational journals a 
few years ago, the editors ran a series of articles under 
the general caption, ‘Why I am a teacher.” It re- 
minded me of the spirited discussion that one of the 
Sunday papers started some years since on the world- 
old query, “Is marriage a failure?” And some of the 
articles were fully as sickening in their harrowing details 
as were some of the whining matrimonial confessions of
-P-A-G-E-22
  2 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
the latter series. But the point that I wish to make is 
this: your true craftsman in education never stops to 
ask himself such questions. There are some men to 
whom schoolcraft is a mistress. They love it, and their 
devotion is no make-believe, fashioned out of sentiment, 
and donned for the purpose of hiding inefficiency or 
native indolence. They love it as some men love Art, 
and others Business, and others War. They do not 
stop to ask the reason why, to count the cost, or to 
care a fig what people think. They are properly jealous 
of their special knowledge, gained through years of 
special study; they are justly jealous of their special 
skill gained through years of discipline and training. 
They resent the interference of laymen in matters purely 
professional. They resent such interference as would 
a reputable physician, a reputable lawyer, a reputable 
engineer. They resent officious patronage and “fussy” 
meddling. They resent all these things manfully, vigor- 
ously. But your true craftsman will not’whine. If the 
conditions under which he works do not suit him, he 
will fight for their betterment, but he will not whine. 
IV 
And yet this vow of fidelity and devotion to the 
spirit of schoolcraft would be an empty form without 
the two complementary vows that give it worth and 
meaning. These are the vow of poverty and the vow 
of service. It is through these that the true craft 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 13 
spirit must find its most vigorous expression and its 
only justification. The very corner stone of schoolcraft 
is service, and one fundamental lesson that the tyro in 
schoolcraft must learn, especially in this materialistic 
age, is that the value of service is not to be measured 
in dollars and cents. In this respect, teaching resembles 
art, music, literature, discovery, invention, and pure 
science; for, if all the workers in all of these branches 
of human activity got together and demanded of the 
world the real fruits of their self-sacrifice and labor, — 
if they demanded all the riches and comforts and ameni- 
ties of life that have flowed directly or indirectly from 
their efforts, — there would be little left for the rest of 
mankind. Each of these activities is represented by a 
craft spirit that recognizes this great truth. The artist 
or the scientist who has an itching palm, who prosti- 
tutes his craft for the sake of worldly gain, is quickly 
relegated to the oblivion that he deserves. He loses 
caste, and the caste of craft is more precious to your 
true craftsman than all the gold of the modern Midas. 
You may think that this is all very well to talk about, 
but that it bears little agreement to the real condi- 
tions. Let me tell you that you are mistaken. Go ask 
Réntgen why he did not keep the X-rays a secret to be 
exploited for his own personal gain. Ask the shade of 
the great Helmholtz why he did not patent the ophthal- 
moscope. Go to the University of Wisconsin and ask 
Professor Babcock why he gave to the world without
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
money and without price the Babcock test — an invention 
which is estimated to mean more than one million 
dollars every year to the farmers and dairymen of that 
state alone. Ask the men on the geological survey who 
laid bare the great gold deposits of Alaska why they 
did not leave a thankless and ill-paid service to acquire 
the wealth that lay at their feet. Because commer- 
cialized ideals govern the world that we know, we 
think that all men’s eyes are jaundiced, and that all 
men’s vision is circumscribed by the milled rim of 
the almighty dollar), But we are sadly, miserably 
mistaken. 
Do you think that these ideals of service from which 
every taint of self-seeking and commercialism have been 
eliminated — do you think that these are mere figments 
of the impractical imagination? Go ask Perry Holden 
out in Iowa. Go ask Luther Burbank out in California. 
Go to any agricultural college in this broad land and 
ask the scientists who are doing more than all other 
forces combined to increase the wealth of the people. 
Go to the scientific departments at Washington where 
men of genius are toiling for a pittance. Ask them 
how much of the wealth for which they are responsible 
they propose to put into their own pockets. What will 
be their answer? They will tell you that all they ask ° 
is a living wage, a chance to work, and the just recog- 
nition of their services by those who know and appre- 
ciate and understand. 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 15 
But let me hasten to add that these men claim no 
especial merit for their altruism and unselfishness, 
They do not pose before the world as philanthropists. 
They do not strut about and preen themselves as who 
would say: “See what a noble man am I! See how I 
sacrifice myself for the welfare of society!” The atti- 
tude of cant and pose is entirely alien to the spirit of 
true service. Their delight is in doing, in serving, in 
producing. But beyond this, they have the faults and 
frailties of their kind, — save one, — the sin of covetous- 
ness. And again, all that they ask of the world is a 
living wage, and the privilege to serve. 
And that is all that the true craftsman in education 
asks. The man or woman with the itching palm has 
no place in the schoolroom,—no place in any craft 
whose keynote is service. It is true that the teacher 
does not receive to-day, in all parts of our country, a 
living wage; and it is equally true that society at large 
is the greatest sufferer because of its penurious policy 
in this regard. I should applaud and support every 
movement that has for its purpose the raising of teachers’ 
salaries to the level of those paid in other branches of 
professional service. Society should do this for its own 
benefit and in its own defense, not as a matter of charity 
to the men and women who, among all public servants, 
should be the last to be accused of feeding gratuitously 
at the public crib. I should approve all honest efforts 
of school men and school women toward this much- 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
desired end. But whenever men and women enter 
schoolcraft because of the material rewards that it 
offers, the virtue will have gone out of our calling, — 
just as the virtue went out of the Church when, during 
the Middle Ages, the Church attracted men, not because 
of the opportunities that it offered for social service, but 
because of the opportunities that it offered for the acqui- 
sition of wealth and temporal power, — just as the 
virtue has gone out of certain other once-noble profes- 
sions that have commercialized their standards and 
tarnished their ideals. 
This is not to say that one condemns the man who 
devotes his life to the accumulation of property. The 
tremendous strides that our country has made in ma- 
terial civilization have been conditioned in part by this 
type of genius. Creative genius must always compel 
our admiration and our respect. It may create a world 
epic, a matchless symphony of tones or pigments, a 
scientific theory of tremendous grasp and limitless scope ; 
or it may create a vast industrial system, a commercial 
enterprise of gigantic proportions, a powerful organiza- 
tion of capital. Genius is pretty much the same wherever 
we find it, and everywhere we of the common clay must 
recognize its worth. 
The grave defect in our American life is not that we 
are hero worshipers, but rather that we worship but 
one type of hero; we recognize but one type of achieve- 
ment; we see but one sort of genius. For two genera- 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 17 
tions our youth have been led to believe that there is 
only one ambition that is worth while, — the ambition 
of property. Success at any price is the ideal that has 
been held up before our boys and girls. And to-day we 
are reaping the rewards of this distorted and unjust 
view of life. 
I recently met a man who had lived for some years 
in the neighborhood of St. Paul and Minneapolis, — a 
section that is peopled, as you know, very largely by 
Scandinavian immigrants and their descendants. This 
man told me that he had been particularly impressed 
by the high idealism of the Norwegian people. His 
business brought him in contact with Norwegian immi- 
grants in what are called the lower walks of life, — with 
workingmen and servant girls, — and he made it a point 
to ask each of these young men and young women the 
same question. “Tell me,” he would say, “who are 
the great men of your country? Who are the men 
toward whom the youth of your land are led to look for 
inspiration? Who are the men whom your boys are 
led to imitate and emulate and admire?” And he said 
that he almost always received the same answer to this 
question: the great names of the Norwegian nation that 
had been burned upon the minds even of these working- 
men and servant girls were just four in number: Ole 
Bull, Bjérnson, Ibsen, Nansen. Over and over again he 
asked that same question; over and over again he 
received the same answer: Ole Bull, Bjérnson, Ibsen, 
c  
-P-A-G-E-28
18 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
Nansen. A great musician, a great novelist, a great 
dramatist, a great scientist. 
And I conjectured as I heard of this incident, What 
would be the answer if the youth of our land were 
asked that question: ‘Who are the great men of your 
country? What type of achievement have you been 
led to imitate and emulate and admire?” How many 
of our boys and girls have even heard of our great men 
in the world of culture,— unless, indeed, such men 
lived a half century ago and have got into the school 
readers by this time? How many of our boys and girls 
have ever heard of MacDowell, or James, or Whistler, - 
or Sargent ? 
I have said that the teacher must take the vow of 
service. What does this imply except that the oppor- 
tunity for service, the privilege of serving, should be 
the opportunity that one seeks, and that the achieve- 
ments toward which one aspires should be the achieve- 
ments of serving? The keynote of service lies in self- 
sacrifice, —in self-forgetfulness, rather, —in merging 
one’s own life in the lives of others. The attitude of the 
true teacher in this respect is very similar to the atti- 
tude of the true parent. In so far as the parent feels 
himself responsible for the character of his children, in 
so far as he holds himself culpable for their shortcomings 
and instrumental in shaping their virtues, he loses him- 
self in his children. What we term parental affection 
is, I believe, in part an outgrowth of this feeling of 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 19 
responsibility. The situation is precisely the same with 
the teacher. It is when the teacher begins to feel him- 
self responsible for the growth and development of his 
pupils that he begins to find himself in the work of 
teaching. It is then that the effective devotion to his 
pupils has its birth. The affection that comes prior to 
this is, I think, very likely to be of the sentimental and 
transitory sort. 
In education, as in life, we play altogether too care- 
lessly with the word “love.” The test of true devotion 
is self-forgetfulness. Until the teacher reaches that 
point, he is conscious of two distinct elements in his 
work, —himself and his pupils. When that time 
comes, his own ego drops from view, and he lives in and 
for his pupils. The young teacher’s tendency is always 
to ask himself, “Do my pupils like me?” Let me say 
that this is beside the question. It is not, from his 
standpoint, a matter of the pupils liking their teacher, 
but of the teacher liking his pupils. That, I take it, 
must be constantly the point of view. If you ask the 
other question first, you will be tempted to gain your 
end by means that are almost certain to prove fatal, 
—to bribe and pet and cajole and flatter, to resort 
to the dangerous expedient of playing to the gallery; 
but the liking that you get in this way is not worth 
the price that you pay for it. I should caution young 
teachers against the short-sighted educational theories 
that are in the air to-day, and that definitely recom-
-P-A-G-E-30

mend this attitude. They may sound sweet, but they 
are soft and sticky in practice. Better be guided by 
instinct than by “half-baked” theory. I have no dis- 
position to criticize the attempts that have been made 
to rationalize educational practice, but a great deal of 
contemporary theory starts at the wrong end. It has 
failed to go to the sources of actual experience for its 
data. I know a father and mother who have brought 
up ten children successfully, and I may say that you 
could learn more about managing boys and girls 
from observing their methods than from a half-dozen 
prominent books on educational theory that I could 
name. . 
And so I repeat that the true test of the teacher’s 
fidelity to this vow of service is the degree in which he 
loses himself in his pupils, —the degree in which he 
lives and toils and sacrifices for them just for the pure 
joy that it brings him. Once you have tasted this joy, 
no carping sneer of the cynic can cause you to lose faith 
in your calling. Material rewards sink into insignifi- 
cance. You no longer work with your eyes upon the 
clock. The hours are all too short for the work that 
you would do. You are as light-hearted and as happy 
as a child, — for you have lost yourself to find yourself, © 
and you have found yourself to lose yourself.

Vv 
And the final vow that I would have these graduates 
take is the vow of idealism, — the pledge of fidelity and 
devotion to certain fundamental principles of life which 
it is the business of education carefully to cherish and 
nourish and transmit untarnished to each succeeding 
generation. These but formulate in another way what 
the vows that I have already discussed mean by impli- 
cation. One is the ideal of social service, upon which 
education must, in the last analysis, rest its case. The 
second is the ideal of science, — the pledge of devotion 
to that persistent unwearying search after truth, of 
loyalty to the great principles of unbiased observation 
and unprejudiced experiment, of willingness to accept 
the truth and be governed by it, no matter how dis- 
agreeable it may be, no matter how roughly it may 
trample down our pet doctrines and our preconceived 
theories. The nineteenth century left us a glorious heri- 
tage in the great discoveries and inventions that science 
has established. These must not be lost to posterity; 
but far better lose them than lose the spirit of free in- 
quiry, the spirit of untrammeled investigation, the noble 
devotion to truth for its own sake that made these dis- 
coveries and inventions possible. 
It is these ideals that education must perpetuate, 
and if education is successfully to perpetuate them, the 
teacher must himself be filled with a spirit of devotion  
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 : CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
to the things that they represent. Science has triumphed 
over superstition and fraud and error. It is the teacher’s 
duty to see to it that this triumph is permanent, that 
mankind does not again fall back into the black pit of 
ignorance and superstition. 
And so it is the teacher’s province to hold aloft the 
torch, to stand against the materialistic tendencies that 
would reduce all human standards to the common de- 
nominator of the dollar, to insist at all times and at all 
places that this nation of ours was founded upon ideal- 
ism, and that, whatever may be the prevailing tendencies 
of the time, its children shall still learn to live ‘‘ among 
the sunlit peaks.” And if the teacher is imbued with 
this idealism, although his work may take him very 
close to Mother Earth, he may still lift his head above 
the fog and look the morning sun squarely in the face.

Optimism IN TEACHING! 
A tHouGH the month is March and not November, it is 
never unseasonable to count up the blessings for which it 
is well to be thankful. In fact, from the standpoint of 
education, the spring is perhaps the appropriate time to 
perform this very pleasant function. As if still further to 
emphasize the fact that education, like civilization, is an 
artificial thing, we have reversed the operations of Mother 
Nature: we sow our seed in the fall and cultivate our 
crops during the winter and reap our harvests in the 
spring. I may be pardoned, therefore, for making the 
theme of my discussion a brief review of the elements of 
growth and victory for which the educator of to-day may 
justly be grateful, with, perhaps, a few suggestions of 
what the next few years may reasonably be expected to 
bring forth. 
And this course is all the more necessary because, 
I believe, the teaching profession is unduly prone to 
pessimism. One might think at first glance that the 
contrary would be true. We are surrounded on every 
side by youth. Youth is the material with which we

tion, March 28, 1908. 
23   
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
constantly deal. Youth is buoyant, hopeful, exu- 
berant; and yet, with this material constantly sur- 
rounding us, we frequently find the task wearisome 
and apparently hopeless. The reason is not far to seek. 
Youth is not only buoyant, it is unsophisticated, it is 
inexperienced, in many important particulars it is crude. 
Some of its tastes must necessarily, in our judgment, 
hark back to the primitive, to the barbaric. Ours is 
continually the task to civilize, to, sophisticate, to refine 
this raw material. But, unfortunately for us, the effort 
that we put forth does not always bring results that 
we can see and weigh and measure. The hopefulness 
of our material is overshadowed not infrequently by its 
crudeness. We take each generation as it comes to us. 
We strive to lift it to the plane that civilized society 
has reached. We do our best and pass it on, mindful 
of the many inadequacies, perhaps of the many failures, 
in our work. We turn to the new generation that takes 
its place. We hope for better materials, but we find no 
improvement. 
And so you and I reflect in our occasional moments 
of pessimism that generic situation which inheres in the 
very work that we do. The constantly accelerated 
progress of civilization lays constantly increasing bur- 
dens upon us. In some way or another we must ac- 
complish the task. In some way or another we must 
lift the child to the level of society, and, as society is 
reaching a continually higher and higher level, so the
-P-A-G-E-35
OPTIMISM IN TEACHING 25 
distance through which the child must be raised is 
ever increased. We would like to think that all this 
progress in the race would come to mean that we should 
be able to take the child at a higher level; but you 
who deal with children know from experience the prin- 
ciple for which the biologist Weismann stands sponsor — 
the principle, namely, that acquired characteristics 
are not inherited; that whatever changes may be 
wrought during life in the brains and nerves and 
muscles of the present generation cannot be passed on 
to its successor save through the same laborious process 
of acquisition and training; that, however far the 
civilization of the race may progress, education, whose 
duty it is to conserve and transmit this civilization, 
must always begin with the ‘“‘same old child.” 
This, I take it, is the deep-lying cause of the school- 
master’s pessimism. In our work we are constantly 
struggling against that same inertia which held the 
race in bondage for how many millenniums only the 
evolutionist can approximate a guess, — that inertia of 
the primitive, untutored mind which we to-day know 
as the mind of childhood, but which, for thousands of 
generations, was the only kind of a mind that man 
possessed. This inertia’'has been conquered at various 
times in the course of recorded history,—in Egypt 
and China and India, in Chaldea and Assyria, in 
Greece and Rome, — conquered only again to reassert 
itself and drive man back into barbarism. Now we of
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
the Western world have conquered it, let us hope, for 
all time; for we of the Western world have dis- 
covered an effective method of holding it in abeyance, 
and this method is universal public education. 
Let Germany close her public schools, and in two 
generations she will lapse back into the semi-darkness 
of medievalism; let her close both her public schools 
and her universities, and three generations will fetch 
her face to face with the Dark Ages; let her destroy 
her libraries and break into ruin all of her works of art, 
all of her existing triumphs of technical knowledge and 
skill, from which a few, self-tutored, might glean the 
wisdom that is every one’s to-day, and Germany will 
soon become the home of a savage race, as it was in the 
days of Tacitus and Cesar. Let Italy close her public 
schools, and Italy will become the same discordant 
jumble of petty states that it was a century ago, — 
again to await, this time perhaps for centuries or mil- 
lenniums, another Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel to 
work her regeneration. Let Japan close her public 
schools, and Japan in two generations will be a bar- 
baric kingdom of the Shoguns, shorn of every vestige of 
power and prestige, — the easy victim of the machina- 
tions of Western diplomats. Let our country cease in its 
work of education, and these United States must needs 
pass through the reverse stages of their growth until 
another race of savages shall roam through the un- 
broken forest, now and then to reach the shores of
-P-A-G-E-37
  
OPTIMISM IN TEACHING 27 
ocean and gaze through the centuries, eastward, to 
catch a glimpse of the new Columbus. Like the moving 
pictures of the kinetoscope when the reels are reversed, 
is the picture that imagination can unroll if we grant 
the possibility of a lapse from civilization to savagery. 
And so when we take the broader view, we quickly 
see that, in spite of our pessimism, we are doing some- 
thing in the world. We are part of that machine which 
civilization has invented and is slowly perfecting to 
preserve itself. We may be a very small part, but, so 
long as the responsibility for a single child rests upon 
us, we are not an unimportant part. Society must 
reckon with you and me perhaps in an infinitesimal 
degree, but it must reckon with the institution which 
we represent as it reckons with no other institution that 
it has reared to subserve its needs. 
In a certain sense these statements are platitudes. 
We have repeated them over and over again until the 
words have lost their tremendous significance. And it 
behooves us now and again to revive the old substance 
in a new form, — to come afresh to a self-consciousness 
of our function. It is not good for any man to hold a 
debased and inferior opinion of himself or of his work, 
and in the field of schoolcraft it is easy to fall into this 
self-depreciating habit of thought. We cannot hope 
that the general public will ever come to view our work 
in the true perspective that I have very briefly out- 
lined. It would probably not be wise to promulgate
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
publicly so pronounced an affirmation of our function 
and of our worth. The popular mind must think in 
concrete details rather than in comprehensive principles, 
when the subject of thought is a specialized vocation. 
You and I have crude ideas, no doubt, of the lawyer’s 
function, of the physician’s function, of the clergyman’s 
function. Not less crude are their ideas of our func- 
tion. Even when they patronize us by saying that our 
work is the noblest that any man or woman would 
engage in, they have but a vague and shadowy per- 
ception of its real significance. I doubt not that, with 
the majority of those who thus pat us verbally upon 
the back, the words that they use are words only. They 
do not envy us our privileges, — unless it is our summer 
vacations, — nor do they encourage their sons to enter 
service in our craft. The popular mind — the nontech- 
nical mind,—must work in the concrete; —it must have 
visible evidences of power and influence before it pays 
homage to a man or to an institution. 
Throughout the German empire the traveler is brought 
constantly face to face with the memorials that have 
been erected by a grateful people to the genius of the 
Tron Chancellor. Bismarck richly deserves the tribute 
that is paid to his memory, but a man to be honored 
in this way must exert a tangible and an obvious in- 
fluence. 
And yet, in a broader sense, the preéminence of Ger- 
many is due in far greater measure to two men whose
-P-A-G-E-39
  OPTIMISM IN TEACHING 29 
names are not so frequently to be found inscribed upon 
towers and monuments. In the very midst of the havoc 
and devastation wrought by the Napoleon wars, — at 
the very moment when the German people seemed 
hopelessly crushed and defeated, —an intellect more 
penetrating than that of Bismarck grasped the logic 
of the situation. With the inspiration that comes 
with true insight, the philosopher Fichte issued his 
famous Addresses to the German people. With clear- 
cut argument couched in white-hot words, he drove 
home the great principle that lies at the basis of United 
Germany and upon the results of which Bismarck and 
Von Moltke and the first Emperor erected the splendid 
structure that to-day commands the admiration of the 
world. Fichte told the German people that their only 
hope lay in universal, public education. And the king- 
dom of Prussia — impoverished, bankrupt, war-ridden, 
and war-devastated — heard the plea. A great scheme 
that comprehended such an education was already at 
hand. It had fallen almost stillborn from the only 
kind of a mind that could have produced it, —a mind 
that was suffused with an overwhelming love for hu- 
manity and incomparably rich with the practical experi- 
ences of a primary schoolmaster. It had fallen from the 
mind of Pestalozzi, the Swiss reformer, who thus stands 
with Fichte as one of the vital factors in the develop- 
ment of Germany’s educational supremacy. 
The people’s schools of Prussia, imbued with the 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
3° 4 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
enthusiasm of Fichte and .Pestalozzi,' gave to Ger- 
many the tremendous advantage that enabled it so 
easily to overcome its hereditary foe, when, two genera- 
tions later, the Franco-Prussian War was fought; for 
the Volksschule gave to Germany something that no 
other nation of that time possessed; namely, an edu- 
cated proletariat, an intelligent common people. Bis- 
marck knew this when he laid his cunning plans for the 
unification of German states that was to crown the 
brilliant series of victories beginning at Sedan and end- 
ing within the walls of Paris. William of Prussia knew 
it when, in the royal palace at Versailles, he accepted 
the crown that made him the first Emperor of United 
Germany. Von Moltke knew it when, at the capitula- 
tion of Paris, he was asked to whom the credit of the 
victory was due, and he replied, in the frank simplicity 
of the true soldier and the true hero, ‘The schoolmaster 
did it.” 
And yet Bismarck and Von Moltke and the Emperor 
are the heroes of Germany, and if Fichte and Pestalozzi 
are not forgotten, at least their memories are not 
cherished as are the memories of the more tangible and 
obvious heroes. Instinct lies deeply embedded in hu- 
man nature and it is instinctive to think in the con- 
crete. And so I repeat that we cannot expect the

general public to share in the respect and veneration 
which you and I feel for our calling, for you and I are 
technicians in education, and we can see the process 
as a comprehensive whole. But our fellow men and 
women have their own interests and their own depart- 
ments of technical knowledge and skill; they see the 
schoolhouse and the pupils’ desks and the books and 
other various material symbols of our work, — they see 
these things and call them education; just as we see a 
freight train thundering across the viaduct or a steamer 
swinging out in the lake and call these. things com- 
merce. In both cases, the nontechnical mind asso- 
ciates the word with something concrete and tangible; 
in both cases, the technical mind associates the same 
word with an abstract process, comprehending a move- 
ment of vast proportions. 
To compress such a movement — whether it be 
commerce or government or education —in a single 
conception requires a multitude of experiences involv- 
ing actual adjustments with the materials involved; 
involving constant reflection upon hidden meanings, 
painful investigations into hidden causes, and mastery 
of a vast body of specialized knowledge which it takes 
years of study to digest and assimilate. 
It is not every stevedore upon the docks, nor every 
stoker upon the steamers, nor every brakeman upon 
the railroads, who comprehends what commerce really 
means. It is not every banker’s clerk who knows the 
4 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
    32 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
meaning of business. It is not every petty holder of 
public office who knows what government really means. 
But this, at least, is true: in proportion as the worker 
knows the meaning of the work that he does, — in pro- 
portion as he sees it in its largest relations to society 
and to life,—his work is no longer the drudgery of 
routine toil. It becomes instead an intelligent process 
directed toward a definite goal. It has acquired that 
touch of artistry which, so far as human testimony goes, 
is the only pure and uncontaminated source of human 
happiness. 
And the chief blessing for which you and I should 
be thankful to-day is that this larger view of our call- 
ing has been vouchsafed to us as it has been vouch- 
safed no former generation of teachers. Education as 
the conventional prerogative of the rich,—as the 
garment which separated the higher from the lower 
classes of society, — this could scarcely be looked upon 
as a fascinating and uplifting ideal from which to derive 
hope and inspiration in the day’s work; and yet this 
was the commonly accepted function of education for 
thousands of years, and the teachers who did the actual 
work of instruction could not but reflect in their atti- 
tude and bearing the servile character of the task that 
they performed. Education to fit the child to earn a 
better living, to command a higher wage, — this myopic 
view of the function of the school could do but little 
to make the work of teaching anything but drudgery;
-P-A-G-E-43
    OPTIMISM IN TEACHING 33 
and yet it is this narrow and materialistic view that 
has dominated our educational system to within a com- 
paratively few years. 
So silently and yet so insistently have our craft 
ideals been transformed in the last two decades that 
you and I are scarcely aware that our point of view 
has been changed and that we are looking upon our 
work from a much higher point of vantage and in a 
light entirely new. And yet this is the change that has 
been wrought. That education, in its widest meaning, is 
the sole conservator and transmitter of civilization to suc- 
cessive generations found expression as far back as Aris- 
totle and Plato, and has been vaguely voiced at intervals 
down through the centuries; but its complete establish- 
ment came only as an indirect issue of the great scientific 
discoveries of the nineteenth century, and its application 
to the problems of practical schoolcraft and its dissemina- 
tion through the rank and file of teachers awaited the 
dawn of the twentieth century. To-day we see expres- 
sions and indications of the new outlook upon every 
hand, in the greatly increased professional zeal that 
animates the teacher’s calling; in the widespread move- 
ment among all civilized countries to raise the standards 
of teachers, to eliminate those candidates for service 
who have not subjected themselves to the discipline of 
special preparation; in the increased endowments and 
appropriations for schools and seminaries that prepare 
teachers; and, perhaps most strikingly at the present 
D

moment, in that concerted movement to organize into 
institutions of formal education, all of those branches 
of training which have, for years, been left to the chance 
operation of economic needs working through the crude 
and unorganized though often effective apprentice sys- 
tem. The contemporary fervor for industrial educa- 
tion is only one expression of this new view that, in the 
last analysis, the school must stand sponsor for the 
conservation and transmission of every valuable item of 
experience, every usable fact or principle, every tiniest 
perfected bit of technical skill, every significant ideal or 
prejudice, that the race has acquired at the cost of so 
much struggle and suffering and effort. 
Irepeat that this new vantage point from which to 
gain a comprehensive view of our calling has been at- 
tained only as an indirect result of the scientific investiga- 
tions of the nineteenth century. We are wont to study 
the history of education from the work and writings of a 
few great reformers, and it is true that much that is valu- 
able in our present educational system can be understood 
and appreciated only when viewed in the perspective 
of such sources. Aristotle and Quintilian, Abelard and 
St. Thomas Aquinas, Sturm and Philip Melanchthon, Co- 
menius, Pestalozzi, Rousseau, Herbart, and Froebel still 
live in the schools of to-day. Their genius speaks to us 
through the organization of subject-matter, through the 
art of questioning, through the developmental methods of 
teaching, through the use of pictures, through objective
-P-A-G-E-45
OPTIMISM IN TEACHING 35 
instruction, andina thousand otherforms. But this domi- 
nant ideal of education to which I have referred and which 
is so rapidly transforming our outlook and vitalizing our 
organization and inspiring us to new efforts, is not to be 
drawn from these sources. The new histories of educa- 
tion must account for this new ideal, and to do this they 
must turn to the masters in science who made the middle 
part of the nineteenth century the period of the most pro- 
found changes that the history of human thought records.! 
With the illuminating principle of evolution came a new 
and generously rich conception of human growth and 
development. The panorama of evolution carried man 
back far beyond the limits of recorded human history and 
indicated an origin as lowly as the succeeding uplift has 
been sublime. The old depressing and fatalistic notion 
that the human race was on the downward path, and 
that the march of civilization must sooner or later end 
in a cul-de-sac (a view which found frequent expres- 
sion in the French writers of the eighteenth century and 
which dominated the skepticism of the dark hours preced- 
ing the Revolution) — this fatalistic view met its death- 
blow in the principle of evolution. A vista of hope en- 
tirely undreamed of stretched out before the race. If the 
tremendous leverage of the untold millenniums of brute 
and savage ancestry could be overcome, even in slight 
1 While the years from 1840 to 1870 mark the period of intellectual 
revolution, it should not be inferred that the education of this period 
reflected these fundamental changes of outlook. On the contrary, these 
years were in general marked by educational stagnation.

measure, by a few short centuries of intelligence and rea- 
son, what might not happen in a few more centuries of 
constantly increasing light? In short, the principle of 
evolution supplied the perspective that was necessary to 
an adequate evaluation of human progress. 
But this inspiriting outlook which was perhaps the 
most comprehensive result of Darwin’s work had indirect 
consequences that were vitally significant to education. 
It is with mental and not with physical development that 
education is primarily concerned, and yet mental develop- 
ment is now known to depend fundamentally upon phys- 
ical forces. The same decade that witnessed the publica- 
tion of the Origin of Species also witnessed the birth of 
another great book, little known except to the specialist, 
and yet destined to achieveimmortality. This book is the 
Elements of Psychophysics, the work of the German sci- 
entist Fechner. The intimate relation between mental life 
and physical and physiological forces was here first clearly 
demonstrated, and the way was open for a science of psy- 
chology which should cast aside the old and threadbare 
raiment of mystery and speculation and metaphysic, 
and stand forth naked and unashamed. 
But all this was only preparatory to the epoch- 
making discoveries that have had so much to do with our 
present attitude toward education. The Darwinian hy- 
pothesis led to violent controversy, not only between the 
opponents and supporters of the theory, but also among 
the various camps of the evolutionists themselves.
-P-A-G-E-47
  
OPTIMISM IN TEACHING ay 
Among these controversies was that which concerned 
itself with the inheritance of acquired characteristics, 
and the outcome of that conflict has a direct signifi- 
cance to present educational theory. The principle, now 
almost conclusively established,! that the character- 
istics acquired by an organism during its lifetime are 
not transmitted by physical heredity to its offspring, 
must certainly stand as the basic principle of education ; 
for everything that we identify as human as contrasted 
with that which is brutal must look to education for its 
preservation and support. It has been stated by compe- 
tent authorities that, during the past ten thousand years, 
there has been no significant change in man’s physical 
constitution. This simply means that Nature finished 
her work as far as man is concerned far beyond the re- 
motest period that human history records; that, for all 
that we can say to-day, there must have existed in the 
very distant past human beings who were just as well 
adapted by nature to the lives that we are leading as we 
are to-day adapted; that what they lacked and what we 
possess is simply a mass of traditions, of habits, of ideals, 
and prejudices which have been slowly accumulated 
through the ages and which are passed on from generation 
to generation by imitation and instruction and training 
and discipline ; and that the child of to-day, left to his own 
devices and operated upon in no way by the products of

civilization, would develop into a savage undistinguish- 
able in all significant qualities from other savages. 
The possibilities that follow from such a conception 
are almost overwhelming even at first glance, and yet 
the theory is borne out by adequate experiments. The 
transformation of the Japanese people through two gener- 
ations of education in Western civilization is a complete 
upsetting of the old theory that as far as race is concerned, 
there is anything significantly important in blood, and 
confirms the view that all that is racially significant 
depends upon the influences that surround the young of 
the race during the formative years. The complete 
assimilation of foreign ingredients into our own na- 
tional stock through the instrumentality of the public 
school is another demonstration that the factors which 
form the significant characteristics in the lower animals 
possess but a minimum of significance to man,—that 
color, race, stature, and even brain weight and the shape 
of the cranium, have very little to do with human worth 
or human efficiency save in extremely abnormal cases. 
And so we have at last a fundamental principle with 
which to illumine the field of our work and from which to 
derive not only light but inspiration. Unite this with 
John Fiske’s penetrating induction that the possibilities 
of progress through education are correlated directly with 
the length of the period of growth or immaturity, — that 
is, that the races having the longest growth before matur- 
ity are capable of the highest degree of civilization, —
-P-A-G-E-49
  
OPTIMISM IN TEACHING 39 
and we have a pair of principles the influence of which we 
see reflected all about us in the great activity for educa- 
tion and especially in the increased sense of pride and 
responsibility and respect for his calling that is animating 
the modern teacher. 
And what will be the result of this new point of view ? 
First and foremost, an increased general respect for the 
work. Until a profession repects itself, it cannot very 
well ask for the world’s respect, and until it can respect 
itself on the basis of scientific principles indubitably 
established, its respect for itself will be little more than 
the irritating self-esteem of the goody-goody order which 
is so often associated with our craft. 
With our own respect for our calling, based upon this 
incontrovertible principle, will come, sooner or later, 
increased compensation for the work and increased pres- 
tige in the community. I repeat that these things can 
only come after we have established a true craft spirit. 
If we are ashamed of our calling, if we regret openly and 
publicly that we are not lawyers or physicians or dentists 
or bricklayers or farmers or anything rather than teachers, 
the public will have little respect for the teacher’s calling. 
As long as we criticize each other before laymen and 
make light of each other’s honest efforts, the public 
will question our professional standing on the ground that 
we have no organized code of professional ethics, — a 
prerequisite for any profession. 
I started out to tell you something that we ought to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  4° CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
thankful for, — something that ought to counteract 
in a measure the inevitable tendencies toward pes- 
simism and discouragement. The hopeful thing about 
our present status is that we have an established 
principle upon which to work. A writer in a recent 
periodical stoutly maintained that education was in 
the position just now that medicine was in during the 
Middle Ages. The statement is hardly fair, either to 
medicine or to education. If one were to attempt a 
parallel, one might say that education stands to-day 
where medicine stood about the middle of the nine- 
teenth century. The analogy might be more closely 
drawn by comparing our present conception of education 
with the conception of medicine just prior to the appli- 
cation of the experimental method to a solution of its 
problems. Education has still a long road to travel 
before it reaches the point of development that medicine 
has to-day attained. It has still to develop principles 
that are comparable to the doctrine of lymph therapy or 
to that latest triumph of investigation in the field of 
medicine,— the theory of opsonins, — which almost makes 
one believe that in a few years violent accident and old 
age will be the only sources of death in the human race. 
Education, we admit, has a long road to travel before 
it reaches so advanced a point of development. But 
there is no immediate cause for pessimism or de- 
spair. We need especially, now that the purpose of 
education is adequately defined, an adequate doctrine
-P-A-G-E-51
OPTIMISM IN TEACHING 41 
‘ 
of educational values and a rich and vital infusion of 
the spirit of experimental science. For efficiency in the 
work of instruction and training, we need to know the 
influence of different types of experience in controlling 
human conduct, — we need to know just what degree of 
  
    efficiency is exerted by our arithmetic and literature, our   
geography and history, our drawing and manual training, 
our Latin and Greek, our ethics and psychology. It is 
the lack of definite ideas and criteria in these fields 
that constitutes the greatest single source of waste in 
our educational system to-day. 
And yet even here the outlook is extremely hopeful. 
The new movement toward industrial education is 
placing greater and greater emphasis upon those sub- 
jects of instruction and those types of methods whose 
efficiency can be tested and determined in an accurate 
fashion. The intimate relation between the classroom, 
on the one hand, and the machine shop, the experi- 
mental farm, the hospital ward and operating room, 
and the practice school, on the other hand, indicates a 
source of accurate knowledge with regard to the way 
in which our teachings really affect the conduct and 
adjustment of our pupils that cannot fail within a short 
time to serve as the basis for some illuminating principle 
of educational values. This, I believe, will be the next 
great step in the development of our profession. 
There has been no intention in what I have said to 
minimize the disadvantages and discouragements under  
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
which we are to-day doing our work. My only plea is 
for the hopeful and optimistic outlook which, I main- 
tain, is richly justified by the progress that has already 
been made and by the virile character of the forces that 
are operating in the present situation. 
On the whole, I can see no reason why I should not 
encourage young men to enter the service of school- 
craft. I cannot say to them that they will attain to 
great wealth, but I can safely promise them that, if 
they give to the work of preparation the same atten- 
tion and time that they would give to their education 
and training for medicine or law or engineering, their 
services will be in large demand and their rewards not 
to be sneered at. Their incomes will not enable them 
to compete with the captains of industry, but they will 
permit as full an enjoyment of the comforts of life as it 
is good for any young man to command. But the am- 
bitious teacher must pay the price to reap these re- 
wards, — the price of time and energy and labor, — the 
price that he would have to pay for success in any other 
human calling. What I cannot promise him in educa- 
tion is the opportunity for wide popular adulation, but 
this, after all, is a matter of taste. Some men crave it 
and they should go into those vocations that will give 
it to them. Others are better satisfied with the dis- 
criminating recognition and praise of their own fellow- 
craftsmen.

How May We Promote THE EFFICIENCY OF THE 
TEACHING Force * 
I 
EFFICcIENcy seems to be a word to conjure with in these 
days. Popular speech has taken it in its present conno- 
tation from the technical vocabulary of engineering, and 
the term has brought with it a very refreshing sense of 
accuracy and practicality. It suggests blueprints and 
T-squares and mathematical formule. A faint and rather 
pleasant odor of lubricating oil and cotton waste seems 
to hover about it. The efficiency of a steam engine or 
a dynamo is a definitely determinable and measurable 
factor, and when we use the term “efficiency” in pop- 
ular speech we convey through the word somewhat of 
this quality of certainty and exactitude. 
An efficient man, very obviously, is a man who “makes 
good,”” who surmounts obstacles, overcomes difficulties, 
and “gets results.” Rowan, the man who achieved’im- 
mortality on account of a certain message that he carried 
  
      to Garcia, is the contemporary standard of human effi- 
1 A paper read before the Normal and Training Teachers’ Conference 
of the New York State Teachers’ Association, December 27, 1907.

-P-A-G-E-54
  44 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
ciency. He was given a task to do, and he did it. He 
did not stop to inquire whether it was interesting, or 
whether it was easy, or whether it would be remunerative, 
or whether Garcia was a pleasant man to meet. He 
simply took the message and brought back the answer. 
Here we have efficiency in human endeavor reduced to its 
lowest terms: to take a message and to bring back an 
answer ; to do the work that is laid out for one to do with- 
out shirking or “soldiering” or whining; and to “make 
good,” to get results. 
Now if we are to improve the efficiency of the teacher, 
the first thing to do is to see that the conditions of effi- 
ciency are fulfilled as far as possible at the outset. In 
other words, efficiency is impossible unless one is set a 
certain task to accomplish. Rowan was told to carry a 
message to Garcia. He was to carry it to Garcia, not to 
Queen Victoria or Li Hung Chang or J. Pierpont Mor- 
gan, or any one else whom he may have felt inclined 
to choose as its recipient. And that is just where 
Rowan had a decided advantage over many teachers 
who have every ambition to be just as efficient as he was. 
To expect a young teacher not only to get results, but 
also to determine the results that should be obtained, 
multiplies his chances of failure, not by two, as one might 
assume at first thought, but almost by infinity. 
Let me give an example of what mean. A young man 
graduated from college during the hard times of the 
middle nineties. It was imperative that he secure some
-P-A-G-E-55
  EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS 45 
sort of a remunerative employment, but places were very 
scarce and he had to seek a long time before he found any- 
thing to which he could turn hishand. The position that 
he finally secured was that of teacher in an ungraded 
school in a remote settlement. School-teaching was far 
from his thoughts and still farther from his ambitions, 
but forty dollars a month looked too good to be true, espe- 
cially as he had come to the point where his allowance 
of food consisted of one plate of soup each day, with the 
small supply of crackers that went with it. He accepted 
the position most gratefully. 
He taught this school for two years. He had no super- 
vision. He read various books on the science and art of 
teaching and upon a certain subject that went by the 
name of psychology, but he could see no connection be- 
tween what these books told him and the tasks that he 
had to face. Finally he bought a book that was adver- 
tised as indispensable to young teachers. The first words 
of the opening paragraph were these: ‘Teacher, if you 
know it all, don’t read this book.” The young man 
threw the volume in the fire. He had no desire to profit 
by the teaching of an author who began his instruction 
with an insult. From that time until he left the school, 
he never opened a book on educational theory. 
His first year passed off with what appeared to be the 
most encouraging success. He talked to his pupils on 
science and literature and history. They were very good 
children, and they listened attentively. When he tired of
-P-A-G-E-56
46 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
talking, he set the pupils to writing in their copy books, 
while he thought of more things to talk about. He 
covered a great deal of ground that first year. Scarcely 
a field of human knowledge was left untouched. His pu- 
pils were duly informed about the plants and rocks and 
trees, about the planets and constellations, about atoms 
and molecules and the laws of motion, about digestion and 
respiration and the wonders of the nervous system, about 
Shakespeare and Dickens and George Eliot. And his 
pupils were very much interested in it all. Their faces 
had that glow of interest, that look of wonderment and 
absorption, that you get sometimes when you tell a little 
four-year-old the story of the three bears. He never 
had any troubles of discipline, because he never asked 
his pupils to do anything that they did not wish to do. 
There were six pupils in his “chart class.” They were 
anxious to learn to read, and three of them did learn. 
Their mothers taught them at home. The other three 
were still learning at the end of the second year. He 
concluded that they had been “born short,”’ but he liked 
them and they liked him. - He did not teach his pupils 
spelling or writing. If they learned these things they 
learned them without his aid, and it is safe to say that 
they did not learn them in any significant measure. He 
did not like arithmetic, and so he just touched on it now 
and then for the sake of appearances. 
This teacher was elected for the following year at a 
handsome increase of salary. He took this to mean a
-P-A-G-E-57
  EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS 47 
hearty indorsement of his methods; consequently he 
followed the same general plan the next year. He had 
told his pupils about everything that he knew, so he 
started over again, much to their delight. He left at the 
close of the year, amidst general lamentation. School- 
teaching was a delightful occupation, but he had mas- 
tered the art, and now he wished to attack something 
that was really difficult. He would study law. It is no 
part of the story that he did not. Neither is it part of 
the story that his successor had a very hard time getting 
that school straightened out; in fact, I believe it re- 
quired three or four successive successors to make even 
an impression. 
Now that man’s work was a failure, and the saddest 
kind of a failure, for he did not realize that he had failed 
until years afterward. He failed, not because he lacked 
ambition and enthusiasm; he had a large measure of 
both these indispensable qualities. He failed, not be- 
cause he lacked education and a certain measure of what 
the world calls culture ; from the standpoint of education, 
he was better qualified than most teachers in schools 
of that type. He failed, not because he lacked social 
spirit and the ability to codperate with the church and the 
home; he mingled with the other members of the com- 
munity, lived their life and thought their thoughts and 
enjoyed their social diversions. The community liked 
him and respected him. His pupils liked him and re- 
spected him; and yet what he fears most of all to-day  
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
is that he may come suddenly face to face with one of 
those pupils and be forced to listen to a first-hand ac- 
count of his sins of omission. 
This man failed simply because he did not do what the 
elementary teacher must do if he is to be efficient as an 
elementary teacher. He did not train his pupils in the 
habits that are essential to one who is to live the social 
life. He gave them a miscellaneous lot of interesting 
information which held their attention while it lasted, 
but which was never mastered in any real sense of the 
term, and which could have but the most superficial 
influence upon their future conduct. But, worst of all, 
he permitted bad and inadequate habits to be developed | 
at the most critical and plastic period of life. His pupils 
had followed the lines of least effort, just as he had fol- 
lowed the lines of least effort. The result was a well- 
established prejudice against everything that was not 
superficially attractive and intrinsically interesting. 
Now this man’s teaching fell short simply because he 
did not know what results he ought to obtain. He had 
been given a message to deliver, but he did not know to 
whom he should deliver it. Consequently he brought the 
answer, not from Garcia, but from a host of other per- 
sonages with whom he was better acquainted, whose lan- 
guage he could speak and understand, and from whom he 
was certain of a warm welcome. In other words, having 
no definite results for which he would be held responsible, 
he did the kind of teaching that he liked to do. That
-P-A-G-E-59
  ‘EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS 49 
might, under certain conditions, have been the best kind 
of teaching for his pupils. But these conditions did not 
happen to operate at that time. The answer that he 
brought did not happen to be the answer that was needed. 
That it pleased his employers does not in the least mitigate 
the failure. That a teacher pleases the community in 
which he works is not always evidence of his success. 
It is dangerous to make a statement like this, for some are 
sure to jump to the opposite conclusion and assume that 
one who is unpopular in the community is the most suc- 
cessful. Needless to say, the reasoning is fallacious. 
The matter of popularity is a secondary criterion, not a 
primary criterion of the efficiency of teaching. One may 
be successful and popular or successful and unpopular; 
unsuccessful and popular or unsuccessful and unpopular. 
The question of popularity is beside the question of effi- 
ciency, although it may enter into specific cases as a factor. 
I 
And so the first step to take in getting more efficient 
work from young teachers, and especially from inexperi- 
enced and untrained teachers fresh from the high school 
or the college, is to make sure that they know what is 
expected of them. Now this looks to be a very simple 
precaution that no one would be unwise enough to omit. 
As a matter of fact, a great many superintendents and 
principals are not explicit and definite about the results 
that they desire. Very frequently all that is asked of a 
E  
-P-A-G-E-60
  5° CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
teacher is that he or she keep things running smoothly, 
keep pupils and parents good-natured. Let me assert 
again that this ought to be done, but that it is no meas- 
ure of a teacher’s efficiency, simply because it can be 
done and often is done by means that defeat the purpose 
of the school. As a young principal in a city system, I 
learned some vital lessons in supervision from a very 
skillful teacher. She would come to me week after week 
with this statement: “Tell me what you want done, and 
I will do it.” It took me some time to realize that that 
was just what I was being paid to do, — telling teachers 
what should be accomplished and then seeing that they 
accomplished the task that was set. When I finally 
awoke to my duties, I found myself utterly at a loss to 
make prescriptions. I then learned that there was a 
certain document known as the course of study, which 
mapped out the general line of work and indicated the 
minimal requirements. I had seen this course of study, 
but its function had never impressed itself upon me. I 
had thought that it was one of those documents that 
officials publish as a matter of form but which no one is 
ever expected to read. But I soon discovered that a 
principal had something to do besides passing from room 
to room, looking wisely at the work going on, and pat- 
ting little boys and girls on the head. 
Now a definite course of study is very hard to con- 
struct, — a course that will tell explicitly what the pupils 
of each grade should acquire each term or half-term in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  
EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS 51 
way of habits, knowledge, ideals, attitudes, and preju- 
dices. But such a course of study is the first requisite to 
efficiency in teaching. The system that goes by hit or 
miss, letting each teacher work out his own salvation in 
any way that he may see fit, is just an aggregation of 
such schools as that which I have described. 
It is true that reformers have very strenuously criti- 
cized the policy of restricting teachers to a definite course 
of study. They have maintained that it curtails indi- 
vidual initiative and crushes enthusiasm. It does this in 
a certain measure. Every prescription is in a sense a 
restriction. The fact that the steamship captain must 
head his ship for Liverpool instead of wherever he may 
choose to go is a restriction, and the captain’s individu- 
ality is doubtless crushed and his initiative limited. But 
this result seems to be inevitable and he generally 
manages to survive the blow. The course of study 
must be to the teacher what the sailing orders are to 
‘the captain of the ship, what the stated course is to 
the wheelsman and the officer on the bridge, what the   
      
time-table is to the locomotive engineer, what Garcia and 
the message and the answer were to Rowan. One may 
decry organization and prescription in our educational 
system. One may say that these things tend inevitably 
toward mechanism and formalism and the stultifying of 
initiative. But the fact remains that, whenever pre- 
scription is abandoned, efficiency in general is at an end. 
And so I maintain that every teacher has a right to
-P-A-G-E-62
    52 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
know what he is to be held responsible for, what is ex- 
pected of him, and that this information be just as definite 
and unequivocal as it can be made. It is under the stress 
of definite responsibility that growth is most rapid and 
certain. The more uncertain and intangible the end to 
be gained, the less keenly will one feel the responsibility 
for gaining that end. Unhappily we cannot say to a 
teacher: ‘(Here is a message. Take it to Garcia. Bring 
the answer.” But we may make our work far more defi- 
nite and tangible than it is now. The courses of study 
are becoming more and more explicit each year. Vague 
and general prescriptions are giving place to definite and 
specific prescriptions. The teachers know what they are 
expected to do, and knowing this, they have some meas- 
ure for testing the efficiency of their own efforts. 
Til 
But to make more definite requirements is, after all, 
only the first step in improving efficiency. It is not suffi- 
cient that one know what results are wanted; one must 
also know how these results may be obtained. Improve- 
ment in method means improvement in efficiency, and 
a crying need in education to-day is a scientific investiga- 
tion of methods of teaching. Teachers should be made 
acquainted with the methods that are most economical 
and efficient. As a matter of fact, whatever is done in 
that direction at the present time must be almost entirely 
confined to suggestions and hints.
-P-A-G-E-63
  EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS 53 
Our discussions of methods of teaching may be divided 
into three classes: (1) Dogmatic assertions that such and 
such a method is right and that all others are wrong — 
assertions based entirely upon a@ priori reasoning. For 
example, the assertion that children must never be per- 
mitted to learn their lessons ‘‘ by heart” is based upon 
the general principle that words are only symbols of ideas 
and that, if one has ideas, one can find words of his own in 
which to formulate them. (2) A second class of discus- 
sions of method comprises descriptions of devices that 
have proved successful in certain instances and with cer- 
tain teachers. (3) Of a third class of discussions there are 
very few representative examples. I refer to methods 
that have been established on the basis of experiments in 
which irrelevant factors have been eliminated. In fact, 
I know of no clearly defined report or discussion of this 
sort. An approach to a scientific solution of a definite 
problem of method is to be found in Browne’s mono- 
graph, The Psychology of Simple Arithmetical Processes. 
Another example is represented by the experiments of : 
Miss Steffens, Marx Lobsien, and others, regarding the 
best methods of memorizing, and proving beyond much 
doubt that the complete repetition is more economical 
than the partial repetition. But these conclusions have, 
of course, only a limited field of application to prac- 
tical teaching. We stand in great need of a definite 
experimental investigation of the detailed problems of 
teaching upon which there is wide divergence of opinion.
-P-A-G-E-64
  54 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
A very good illustration is the controversy between the 
how and the why in primary arithmetic. In this case, 
there is a vast amount of “opinion,” but there are no 
clearly defined conclusions drawn from accurate tests. 
It would seem possible to do work of this sort concerning 
the details of method in the teaching of arithmetic, 
spelling, grammar, penmanship, and geography. 
IV 
Lacking this accurate type of data regarding methods, 
the next recourse is to the actual teaching of those 
teachers who are recognized as efficient. Wherever such 
a teacher may be found, his or her work is well worth the 
most careful sort of study. Success, of course, may be 
due to other factors than the methods employed, —to 
personality, for example. But, in every case of recog- 
nized efficiency in teaching that I have observed, I have   
    
  found that the methods employed have, in the main, been 
productive of good results when used by others. The 
experienced teacher comes, through a process of trial 
and error, to select, perhaps unconsciously, the methods 
that work best. Sometimes these are not always to be 
identified with the methods that theoretical pedagogy 
had worked out from a priori bases. For example, the 
type of lesson which I call the “deductive development” 
lesson! is one that is not included in the older discus- 
sions of method; yet it accurately describes one of the 
1 See Educative Process, New York, 1910, Chapter XX.
-P-A-G-E-65
EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS 55 
methods employed by a very successful teacher whose 
work I observed. 
One way, then, to improve the efficiency of young 
teachers, in so far as improvement in methods leads to 
improved efficiency, is to encourage the observation of ex- 
pert teaching. The plan of giving teachers visiting days 
often brings excellent results, especially if the teacher 
looks upon the privilege in the proper light. The hyper- 
critical spirit is fatal to growth under any condition. 
Whenever a teacher has come to the conclusion that he or 
she has nothing to learn from studying the work of others, 
anabolism has ceased and katabolism has set in. The 
self-sufficiency of our craft is one of its weakest character- 
istics. It is the factor that more than any other discounts 
it in the minds of laymen. Fortunately it is less fre- 
quently a professional characteristic than in former 
years, but it still persists in some quarters. I recently 
met a “pedagogue” who impressed me as the most ‘“‘know- 
ing” individual that it had ever been my privilege to 
become acquainted with. .An enthusiastic friend of his, 
in dilating upon this man’s virtues, used these words: 
“When you. propose a subject of conversation in whatever 
field you may choose, you will find that he has mastered 
it to bedrock. He will go over it once and you think that 
he is wise. He starts at the beginning and goes over it 
again, and you realize that he is deep. Once more he 
traverses the same ground, but he is so far down now that 
you cannot follow him, and then you are aware that he is
-P-A-G-E-66
56 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
profound.” That sort of profundity is still not rare in the 
field of general education. The person who has all pos- 
sible knowledge pigeonholed and classified is still in our 
midst.. The pedant still does the cause of education in- 
calculable injury. 
Of the use to which reading circles may be put in im- 
proving the efficiency of teaching, it is necessary to say 
but little. Such organizations, under wise leadership, 
may doubtless be made to serve a good purpose in pro- 
moting professional enthusiasm. The difficulty with 
using them to promote immediate and direct efficiency 
lies in the paucity of the literature that is at our disposal. 
Most of our present-day works upon education are very 
general in their nature. They are not without their 
value, but this value is general and indirect rather than 
immediate and specific. A book like Miss Winterburn’s 
Methods of Teaching, or Chubb’s Teaching of English} is 
especially valuable for young teachers who are looking 
for first-hand helps. But books like this are all too rare 
in our literature. 
On the whole, I think that the improvement of teachers 
in the matter of methods is the most unsatisfactory part 
of our problem.” All that one can say is that the woyk of 
1 Rowe’s Habit Formation (New York, 1909), Briggs and Coffman’s 
Reading in Public Schools (Chicago, 1908), Foght’s The American Rural 
School, Adams’s Exposition and Illustration in Class Teaching (New 
York, 1910), and Perry’s Problems of Elementary Education (New York, 
1910) should certainly be added to this list. 
2 “Tt seems to me one of the most pressing problems in pedagogy to- 
day is that of method. . . . It is the subject in which teachers of peda-
-P-A-G-E-67
  EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS 57 
the best teachers should be observed carefully and faith- 
fully, that the methods upon which there is little or no 
dispute should be given and accepted as standard, but 
that one should be very careful about giving young 
teachers an idea that there is any single form under 
which all teaching can be subsumed. I know of no term 
that is more thoroughly a misnomer in our technical 
vocabulary than the term ‘‘general method.” I teach a 
subject that often goes by that name, byt I always take 
care to explain that the name does not mean, in my class, 
what the words seem to signify. There are certain broad 
and general principles which describe very crudely and 
roughly and inadequately certain phases of certain pro- 
cesses that mind undergoes in organizing experience — 
perception, apperception, conception, induction, deduc- 
tion, inference, generalization, and the like. But these 
terms have only a vague and general connotation; or, 
if their connotation is specific and definite, it has been 
made so by an artificial process of definition in which 
counsel is darkened by words without meaning. The 
only full-fledged law that I know of in the educative 
process is the law of habit building — (x) focalization, 
(2) attentive repetition at intervals of increasing length, 
gogy in Colleges and Universities are weakest to-day. Of what practical 
value is all our study of educational psychology or the history of education, 
our child study, our experimental pedagogy, if it does not finally result in 
the devising of better methods of teaching, and make the teacher more 
skillful and effective in his work.” —T. M. Baturet: “ Undergraduate

(3) permitting no exception — and I am often told that 
this “law” is fallacious. It has differed from some other 
so-called laws, however, in-this respect: it always works. 
Whenever a complex habit is adduced that has not been 
formed through the operation of this law, I am willing 
to give it up. 
Vv 
A third general method of improving the efficiency of 
teaching is to build up the notion of responsibility for 
results. The teacher must not only take the message 
and deliver it to Garcia, or to some other individual as 
definite and tangible, but he must alsg bring the answer. 
So far as I know there is no other way to insure a maxi- 
mum of efficiency than to demand certain results and to 
hold the individual responsible for gaining these results. 
The present standards of the teaching craft are less rigor- 
ous than they should be in this respect. We need a craft 
spirit that will judge every man impartially by his work, 
not by secondary criteria. You remember Finlayson in 
Kipling’s Bridge Builders, and the agony with which he 
watched the waters of the Ganges tearing away at the 
caissons of his new bridge. A vital question of Finlay- 
, son’s life was to be answered by the success or failure of 
those caissons to resist the flood. If they should yield, it 
meant not only the wreck of the bridge, but the wreck of 
his career; for, as Kipling says, ‘Government might 
listen, perhaps, but his own kind would judge him by his 
bridge as that stood or fell.”

President Hall has said that one of the last sentiments 
to be developed in human nature is “‘the sense of respon- 
sibility, which is one of the highest and mast complex 
psychic qualities.” How to develop this sentiment of 
responsibility is one of the most pressing problems of 
education. And the problem is especially pressing in 
those departments of education that train for social 
service. To engender in the young teacher an effective 
prejudice against scamped work, against the making of 
excuses, against the seductive allurements of ease and 
comfort and the lines of least resistance is one of the most 
important duties that is laid upon the normal school, the 
training school, and the teachers’ college. To do well the 
work that has been set for him to do should be the highest 
ambition of every worker, the ambition to which all other 
ambitions and desires are secondary and subordinate. 
Pride inthe mastery of thte-technique of one’s calling is 
the most wholesome and helpful sort of pride that a man 
can indulge in.' The joy of doing each day’s work in the 
best possible manner is the keenest joy of life. But this 
pride and this joy do not come at the outset. Like all 
other good things of life, they come only as the result of 
effort. and struggle. and strenuous self-discipline and 
dogged perseverance. The emotional coloring which 
gives these things their subjective worth is a matter very 
largely of contrast. Success must stand out against a 
background of struggle, or the chief virtue of success 
—the consciousness of conquest — will be entirely 
 
-P-A-G-E-70

missed. That sort of success means strength; for 
strength of mind is nothing more than the ability to 
“hew to the line,” to follow a given course of effort to 
a successful conclusion, no matter how long and how 
tedious be the road that one must travel, no matter 
how disagreeable are the tasks involved, no matter how 
tempting are the insidious siren songs of momentary 
fancy. 
What teachers need — what all workers need — is to 
be inspired with those ideals and prejudices that will en- 
able them to work steadfastly and unremittingly toward 
the attainment of a stated end. What inspired Rowan 
with those ideals of efficiency that enabled him to carry 
his message and bring back the answer, I do not know, 
but if he was a soldier, I do not hesitate to hazard an 
opinion. Our regular army stands as the clearest type of 
efficient service which is available for our study and emula- 
tion. The work of Colonel Goethals on the Panama 
Canal bids fair to be the finest fruit of the training that we 
give to the officers of our army. If we wish to learn the 
fundamental virtues of that training, it is not sufficient 
to study the curriculum of the Military Academy. 
Technical knowledge and skill are essential to such re- 
sults, but they are not the prime essentials. If you wish 
to know what the prime essentials are, let me refer you to 
a series of papers, entitled The Spirit of Old West Point, 
which ran through a recent volume of the Adlantic 
Monthly and which has since been published in book
-P-A-G-E-71
  
EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS 61 
form. They constitute, to my mind, one of the most 
important educational documents of the present decade. 
The army service is efficient because it is inspired with 
effective ideals of service, — ideals in which every other 
desire and ambition is totally and completely subordi- 
nated to the ideal of duty. To those who maintain that 
close organization and definite prescription kill initiative 
and curtail efficiency, the record of West Point and the 
army service should be a silencing argument. 
And yet education is more important than war; more 
important, even, than the building of the Panama Canal. 
We believe, and rightly, that no training is too good for our 
military and naval officers; that no discipline which will 
produce_the appropriate habits and ideals and prejudices 
is too strenuous ; that no individual sacrifice of comfort 
or ease is too costly. Equal or even commensurable 
efficiency in education can come only through a like pro- 
cess. From the times of the ancient Egyptians to the 
present day, one vital truth has been revealed in every 
forward movement; the homely truth that you cannot 
make bricks without straw; you cannot win success 
without effort; you cannot attain efficiency without 
undergoing the processes of discipline; and discipline 
means only this: doing things that you do not want 
to do, for the sake of reaching some end that ought to 
be attained. 
The normal schools and the training schools and the 
teachers’ colleges must be the-nurseries of craft ideals  
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
and standards. The instruction that they offer must be 
upon a plane that will command respect. The intoler- 
able pedantry and the hypocritical goody-goodyism must 
be banished forever. The crass sentimentalism by which 
we attempt to cover our paucity of craft ideals must also 
be eliminated. Those who are most strongly imbued 
with ideals are not those who cheapen the value of 
ideals by constant verbal reiteration. Ideals do not often 
come through explicitly imparted precepts. They come 
through more impalpable and hidden channels, — now 
through stately buildings with vine-covered towers from 
which the past speaks in the silence of great halls and 
cloistered retreats; now through the unwritten and 
scarcely spoken traditions that are expressed in the very 
bearing and attitude of those to whom youth looks for 
inspiration and guidance; now through a dominant and 
powerful personality, sometimes rough and crude, some- 
times warm-hearted and lovable, but always sincere. 
Traditions and ideals are the most priceless part of a 
school’s equipment, and the school that can give these 
things to its students in richest measure will have the 
greatest influence on the succeeding generations.

Tue Test oF EFFICIENCY IN SUPERVISION ! 
I 
I xnow of no way in which I can better introduce my 
subject than to describe very briefly the work of a super- 
intendent who once furnished me with an example of a 
definite and effective method of supervision. This man 
was a “long range” superintendent. It was impossible 
for him to visit his schools very frequently, and so he did 
the next best thing: he had the schools brought to him. 
When I first saw him he was poring over a pile of papers 
that had just come in from one of his schools. I soon 
discovered that these papers were arranged in sets, each 
set being made up of samples taken each week from the 
work of the pupils in the schools under his supervision. 
The papers of each pupil were arranged in chronological 
order, and by looking through the set, he could note the 
growth that the pupil in question had made since the 
beginning of the term. Upon these papers, the superin- 
tendent recorded his judgment of the amount of improve- 
ment shown both in form and in content.

State Association of School Commissioners and Superintendents, Novem-

I was particularly impressed by the character of his 
criticisms. There was nothing vague or intangible about 
them. Every annotation was clear and definite. If pen- 
manship happened to be the point at issue, he would note 
that the lines were too close together; that the letters 
did not have sufficient individuality; that the spaces 
between the words were not sufficiently wide; that 
the indentation was inadequate; that the writing was 
cramped, showing that the pen had not been held prop- 
erly; that the margin needed correction. If the papers 
were defective from the standpoint of language, the criti- 
cisms were equally clear and definite. One pupil had 
misspelled the same word in three successive papers. 
“Be sure that this word appears in the next spelling list,” 
was the comment of the superintendent. Another 
pupil habitually used a bit of false syntax: ‘Place this 
upon the list of errors to be taken up and corrected.” 
Still others were uncertain about paragraphing: ‘‘Devote 
a language lesson to the paragraph before the next written 
exercise.” On the covers of each bundle of class papers, 
he wrote directions and suggestions of a more general 
nature; for example: “Improvement is not sufficiently 
marked; try for better results next time”; or: “I note 
that the pupils draw rather than write; look out for 
free movement.” Often, too, there were words of well- 
merited praise: ‘‘I like the way in which your pupils 
have responded to their drill. Thisis good. Keep it up.” 
And not infrequently suggestions were made as to con-
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE TEST OF EFFICIENCY IN SUPERVISION 65 
tent: ‘Tell this story in greater detail next time, and 
have it reproduced again”’; or: “The form of these papers 
is good, but the nature study is poor; don’t sacrifice 
thought to form.” 
In similar fashion, the other written work was gone 
over and annotated. Every pupil in this system of 
schools had a sample of his written work examined at 
regular and frequent intervals by the superintendent. 
Every teacher knew just what her chief demanded in 
the way of results, and did her best to gain the results 
demanded. I am not taking the position that the results 
that were demanded represented the highest ideals of 
what the elementary school should accomplish. Good 
penmanship and good spelling and good language, in the 
light of contemporary educational thought, seem to be 
something like happiness— you get them in larger 
measure the less you think about getting them. But 
this possible objection aside, the superintendent in ques- 
tion had developed a system which kept him in very 
close touch with the work that was being done in widely 
separated schools. 
He told me further that, on the infrequent occasions 
when he could visit his classrooms, he gave most of his 
time and attention to the matters that could not be 
supervised at ‘long range.” He found out how the 
pupils were improving in their reading, and especially 
in oral expression, in its syntax, its freedom from errors 
of construction, its clearness and fluency. He listed the 
F
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
common errors, directing his teachers to take them up 
in a systematic manner and eradicate them, and he did 
not fail to note at his next visit how much progress had 
been made. He noted the condition of the blackboard 
work, and kept a list of the improvements that he sug- 
gested. He tested for rapidity in arithmetical processes, 
for the papers sent to his office gave him only an index 
of accuracy. He noted the habits of personal cleanliness 
that were being developed or neglected. In fact, he had 
a long list of specific standards that he kept continually 
in mind, the progress toward which he constantly 
watched. And last, but by no means least, he carried 
with him wherever he went an atmosphere of breezy 
good nature and cheerfulness, for he had mastered the 
first principle in the art of both supervision and teaching ; 
he had learned that the best way to promote growth in 
either pupils or teachers is neither to let them do as they 
please nor to force them to do as you please, but to get 
them to please to do what you please to have them do. 
I instance this superintendent as one type of efficiency 
in supervision. He was efficient, not simply because he 
had a system that scrutinized every least detail of his’ 
pupils’ growth, but because that scrutiny really insured 
growth. He obtained the results that he desired, and he 
obtained uniformly good results from a large number of 
young, untrained teachers. We have all heard of the 
superintendent who boasted that he could tell by look- 
ing at his watch just what any pupil in any classroom
-P-A-G-E-77
  
THE TEST OF EFFICIENCY IN SUPERVISION 67 
was doing at just that moment. Surely here system 
was not lacking. But the boast did not strike the vital 
point. It is not what the pupil is doing that is funda- 
mentally important, but what he is gaining from his ac- 
tivity or inactivity; what he is gaining in the way of 
habits, in the way of knowledge, in the way of standards 
and ideals and prejudices, all of which are to govern his 
future conduct. The superintendent whom I have de- 
scribed had the qualities of balance and perspective that 
enabled him to see both the woods and the trees. And 
let me add that he taught regularly in his own central 
high school, and that practically all of his supervision was 
accomplished after school hours and on Saturdays. 
But my chief reason for choosing his work as a type is 
that it represents a successful effort to supervise that 
part of school work which is most difficult and irksome to 
supervise; namely, the formation of habits. Whatever 
one’s ideals of education may be, it still remains true that 
habit building is the most important duty of the elemen- 
tary school, and that the efficiency of habit building can 
be tested in no other way than by the means that he 
employed; namely, the careful comparison of results at 
successive stages of the process. 
II 
The essence of a true habit is its purely automatic 
character. Reaction must follow upon the stimulus in- 
stantaneously, without thought, reflection, or judgment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
    68 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
One has not taught spelling efficiently until spelling is 
automatic, until the correct form flows from the pen 
without the intervention of mind. The real test of the 
pupil’s training in spelling is his ability to spell the word 
correctly when he is thinking, not about spelling, but 
about the content of the sentence that he is writing. 
Consequently the test of efficiency in spelling is not an 
examination in spelling, although this! may be valuable 
as a means to an end, but rather the infrequency with 
which misspelled words appear in the composition work, 
letter writing, and other written work of the pupil. Simi- 
larly in language and grammar, it is not sufficient to in- 
struct in rules of syntax. This is but the initial process. 
Grammatical rules function effectively only when they 
function automatically. So long as one must think and 
judge and reflect upon the form of one’s expression, the 
expression is necessarily awkward and inadequate. 
The same rule holds in respect of the fundamental 
processes of arithmetic. It holds in penmanship, in artic- 
ulation and enunciation, in word recognition, in moral 
conduct and good manners; in fact, in all of the basic 
work for which the elementary school must stand spon- 
sor. And one source of danger in the newer methods 
of education lies in the tendency to overlook the impor- 
tance of carrying habit-building processes through to a 
successful issue. The reaction against drill, against 
formal work of all sorts, is a healthful reaction in many 
ways. It bids fair to break up the mechanical lock step
-P-A-G-E-79
THE TEST OF EFFICIENCY IN SUPERVISION 69 
of the elementary grades, and to introduce some welcome 
life, and vigor, and wholesomeness. But it will sadly 
defeat its own purpose if it underrates the necessity of 
habit building as the basic activity of early education. 
What is needed, now that we have got away from the 
lock step, now that we are happily emancipated from 
the meaningless thralldom of mechanical repetition and 
the worship of drill for its own sake — what is needed now 
is not less drill, but better drill. And this should be the 
net result of the recent reforms in elementary education. 
In our first enthusiasm, we threw away the spelling 
book, poked fun at the multiplication tables, decried 
basal reading, and relieved ourselves of much wit and 
sarcasm at the expense of formal grammar. But now we 
are swinging back to the adequate recognition of the true 
purpose of drill. And in the wake of this newer concep- 
tion, we are learning that its drudgery may be lightened 
and its efficiency heightened by the introduction of a 
richer content that shall provide a greater variety in 
the repetitions, insure an adequate motive for effort, and 
relieve the dead monotony that frequently rendered the 
older methods so futile. I look forward to the time 
when to be an efficient drillmaster in this newer sense of 
the term will be to have reached one of the pinnacles of 
professional skill. 
Til 
But there is another side of teaching that must besuper- 
vised. Although habit is responsible for nine tenths of 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
7o CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
conduct, the remaining tenth must not be neglected. In 
situations where habit is not adequate to adjustment, 
judgment and reflection must come to the rescue, or 
should come to the rescue. This means that, instead of 
acting without thought, as in the case of habit, one ana- 
lyzes the situation and tries to solve it by the application 
of some fact or principle that has been gained either from 
one’s own experience or from the experience of others. 
This is the field in which knowledge comes to its own; 
and a very important task of education is to fix in the 
pupils’ minds a number of facts and principles that will 
be available for application to the situations of later life. 
How, then, is the efficiency of instruction (as distin- 
guished from training or habit building) to be tested ? 
Needless to say, an adequate test is impossible from the 
very nature of the situation. The efficiency of imparting 
knowledge can be tested only by the effect that this 
knowledge has upon later conduct; and this, it will 
be agreed, cannot be accurately determined until the 
pupil has left the school and is face to face with the 
problems of real life. 
In practice, however, we adopt a more or less effective 
substitute for the real test — the substitute called the ex- 
amination. We all know that the ultimate purpose of 
instruction is not primarily to enable pupils successfully 
to pass examinations: And yet as long as we teach as 
though this were the main purpose we might as well be- 
lieve it to be. Now the examination may be madea very
-P-A-G-E-81
  
THE TEST OF EFFICIENCY IN SUPERVISION. qt 
valuable test of the efficiency of instruction if its limita- 
tions are fully recognized and if it does not obscure the 
true purpose of instruction. And if we remember that the 
true purpose is to impart facts in such a manner that they 
may not only “stick” in the pupil’s mind, but that they 
may also be amenable to recall and practical application, 
and if we set our examination questions with some refer- 
ence to this requirement, then I believe that we shall find 
the examination a dependable test. 
One important point is likely to be overlooked in the 
consideration of examinations, — the fact, namely, that 
the form and content of the questions have a very 
powerful influence in determining the content and 
methods of instruction. Is it not pertinent, then, to in- 
quire whether examination questions cannot be so framed 
as radically to improve instruction rather than to en- 
courage, as is often the case, methods that are pedagogi- 
cally unsound? Granted that it is well for the child to 
memorize verbatim certain unrelated facts, even to mem- 
orize some facts that have no immediate bearing upon 
his life, granted that this is valuable (and I think that a 
little of it is), is it necessary that an entire year or half- 
year be given over almost entirely to ‘cramming up” 
on old questions? Would it not be possible so to frame 
examination questions that the “cramming” process 
would be practically valueless? 
What the pupil should get from geography, for in- 
stance, is not only a knowledge of geographical facts, but  
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
also, and more fundamentally, the power to see the rela- 
tion of these facts to his own life; in other words, the 
ability to apply his knowledge to the improvement of 
adjustment. Now this power is very closely associated 
with the ability to grasp fundamental principles, to see 
the relation of cause and effect working below the sur- 
face of diverse phenomena. Geography, to be practical, 
must impress not only the fact, but also the principle 
that rationalizes or explains the fact. It must empha- 
size the ‘“‘why” as well as the “what.” For example: 
it is well for the pupil to know that New York is the 
largest city in the United States; it is better that he 
should know why New York has become the largest city 
in the United States. It is well to know that South 
America extends very much farther to the east than 
does North America, but it is better to know that this 
fact has had an important bearing in determining the 
commercial relations that exist between South America 
and Europe. Questions that have reference to’ these 
larger relations of cause and effect may be so framed that 
no amount of ‘‘cramming”’ will alone insure correct an- 
swers. They may be so framed that the pupil will be 
forced to do some thinking for himself, will be forced to 
solve an imaginary situation very much as he would 
solve a real situation. 
Examination questions of this type would react benefi- 
cially upon the methods of instruction. They would tend 
to place a premium upon that type of instruction that
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE TEST OF EFFICIENCY IN SUPERVISION 73 
develops initiative in solving problems, instead of encour- 
aging the memoriter methods that tend to crush what- 
ever germs of initiative the pupil may possess. This does 
not mean that the memoriter work should be excluded. 
A solid basis of fact is essential to the mastery of principles. 
Personally I believe that the work of the intermediate 
grades should be planned to give the pupil this factual 
basis. This would leave the upper grades free for the 
more rational work. In any case, I believe that the 
efficiency of examinations may be greatly increased by 
giving one or two questions that must be answered 
by a reasoning process for every question that may be 
answered by verbal memory alone. 
IV 
Thus far it seems clear that an absolute standard is 
available for testing the eff 
building, and that a fairly accurate standard may be 
developed for testing the efficiency of instruction. Both 
training and instruction, however, are subject to the 
modifying influence of a third factor of which too little   
    ficiency of training or habit   
account has hitherto been taken in educational discus- 
sions. Training results in habits, and yet a certain sort of 
training may not only result in a certain type of habit, 
but it may also result in the development of something 
which will quite negate the habit that has been developed. 
In the process of developing habits of neatness, for ex- 
ample, one may employ methods that result in prejudicing  
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
the child against neatness as a general virtue. In this 
event, although the little specific habits of neatness may 
function in the situations in which they have been de- 
veloped, the prejudice will effectually prevent their ex- 
tension to other fields. In other words, the general emo- 
tional effect of training must be considered as well as the 
specific results of the training. The same stricture ap- 
plies with equal force to instruction. Instruction im- 
parts knowledge; but if a man knows and fails to feel, his 
knowledge has little influence upon his conduct. 
This factor that controls conduct when habit fails, this 
factor that may even negate an otherwise efficient habit, 
is the great indeterminate in the work of teaching. 
To know that one has trained an effective habit or im- 
parted a practical principle is one thing; to know that in 
doing this, one has not engendered in the pupil’s mind a 
prejudice against the very thing taught is quite another 
matter. 
That phase of teaching which is concerned with the 
development of these intangible forces may be termed 
“inspiration” ; and it is the lack of an adequate test for 
the efficiency of inspiration that makes the task of super- 
vision so difficult and the results so often unsatisfactory. 
Nevertheless, even here the outlook is not entirely 
hopeless. One may be tolerably certain of at least two 
things. In the first place, the great “‘emotionalized preju- 
dices” that must come predominantly from school in- 
fluences are the love of truth, the love of work, respect for
-P-A-G-E-85
  THE TEST OF EFFICIENCY IN SUPERVISION 75 
law and order, and a spirit of codperation. These factors 
undoubtedly have their basis in specific habits of honesty, 
industry, obedience, and regard for the rights and feelings 
of others; and these habits may be developed and tested 
just as thoroughly and just as accurately as habits of 
good spelling and correct syntax. Without the solid 
basis of habit, ideals and prejudices will be of but little 
service. The one caution must be taken that the methods 
of training do not defeat their own purpose by engender- 
ing prejudices and ideals that negate the habits. It is 
here that the personality of the teacher becomes the all- 
important factor, and the task of the supervisor is to 
determine whether the influence of the personality is good 
or evil. Most supervisors come to judge of this influence 
by an undefined factor that is best termed the “‘spirit of 
the classroom.” : 
The second hopeful feature of the task of supervision 
in respect of inspiration is that this “spirit” is an 
extremely contagious and pervasive thing. In other 
words, the principal or the superintendent may dominate 
every classroom under his supervision, almost without 
regard to the limitations of the individual teachers. 
Typical schools in every city system bear compelling 
testimony to this fact. The principal zs the school. 
And if I were to sum up the essential characteristics of 
the ideal supervisor, I could not neglect this point. After 
all, the two great dangers that beset him are, first, the 
danger of sloth — the old Adam of laziness — which will
-P-A-G-E-86
76 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
tempt him to avoid the details, to shirk the drudgery, to 
escape the close and wearisome scrutiny of little things ; - 
and, secondly, the sin of triviality — the inertia which 
holds him to details and never permits him to take the 
broader view and see the true ends toward which details 
are but the means. The proper combination of these 
two factors is all too rare, but it is in this combination 
that the ideal supervisor is to be found.

Ir is difficult not to be depressed by the irrational 
radicalism of contemporary educational theory. It would 
seem that the workers in the higher ranges of educa- 
tional activity should, of all men, preserve a balanced 
judgment and a sane outlook, and yet there is prob- 
ably no other human calling that presents the strange 
phenomenon of men who are called experts throwing 
overboard everything that the past has sanctioned, and 
embarking without chart or compass upon any new ven- 
ture that happens to catch popular fancy. The non-pro- 
fessional character of education is nowhere more painfully 
apparent than in the expression of this tendency. The 
literature of teaching that is written directly out of ex- 
perience — out of actual adjustment. to the teaching 
situation —is almost laughed out of court in some educa- 
tional circles. But if one wishes to win the applause of 
the multitude one may do it easily enough by proclaim- 
ing some new and untried plan. At our educational 
gatherings you notice above everything else a straining 
for spectacular and bizarre effects. It is the novel that 
77  
-P-A-G-E-88
  78 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
catches attention; and it sometimes seems to me that 
those who know the least about the educational situation 
in the way of direct contact often receive the largest 
share of attention and have the largest influence. 
It is in the attitude of the public and of a certain pro- 
portion of school men toward elementary teaching and the 
elementary teacher that this destructive criticism finds 
its most pronounced expression. Throughout the length 
and breadth of the land, the efficiency of the public school 
and the sincerity and intelligence of those who are giving 
their lives to its work are being called into question. It 
is discouraging to think that years of service in a calling 
do not qualify one to speak authoritatively upon the 
problems of that calling, and especially upon technique. 
And yet it is precisely upon that point of technique 
that the criticisms of elementary education are most 
drastic. 
Our educational system is sometimes branded as a 
failure, and yet this same educational system with all 
its weaknesses has accomplished the task of assimilating 
to American institutions and ideals and standards the 
most heterogeneous infusion of alien stocks that ever 
went to the making of a united people. The elemen- 
tary teacher is criticized for all the sins of omission 
that the calendar enumerates, and yet this same ele- 
mentary teacher is daily lifting millions of children 
to a plane of civilization and culture that no other 
people in history have even thought possible. I am
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE SUPERVISOR AND THE TEACHER 19 
willing to admit the deficiencies of American education, 
but I also maintain that the teachers of our lower 
schools do not deserve the opprobrium that has been 
heaped upon them. I believe that in education, as in 
business, it would be a good thing if we saw more of the 
doughnut and less of the hole. When I hear a prominent 
educator say that we must discard everything that we 
have produced thus far and begin anew in the realm of 
educational materials and methods, I confess that I am 
discouraged, especially when that same authority is ex- 
tremely obscure as to the materials and methods that we 
should substitute for those that we are now employing. 
Lheard that statement at a recent meeting of the Depart- 
ment of Superintendence, and I heard other things of like 
tenor, —for example, that normal schools were perpetuat- 
ing types of skill in teaching that were unworthy of per- 
petuation, that the observation of teaching was valueless 
in the training of teachers because there was nothing that 
was being done at the present time that was worthy of 
imitation, that practice teaching in the training of young 
teachers is a farce, a delusion, and a snare. Those very 
words were employed by one man of high position to ex- 
press his opinion of contemporary practices. You cannot 
‘pick up an educational journal of the better sort, nor open 
a new educational book, without being brought face to 
face with this destructive criticism. 
I protest against this, not only in the name of justice, 
but in the name of common sense. It cannot be possible
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
that generations of dealing with immature minds should 
have left no residuum of effective practice. The very 
principle of progress by trial and error will inevitably 
mean that certain practices that are possible and helpful 
and effective are perpetuated, and that certain other pro- 
cesses that are ineffective and wasteful are eliminated. 
To repudiate all this is the height of folly. If the history 
of progress shows us anything, it shows us that progress 
is not made by repudiating the lessons of experience. 
Theory is the last word, not the first. Theory should 
explain: it should take successful practice and find out 
what principles condition its efficiency; and if these 
principles are inconsistent with those heretofore held, 
it is the theory that should be modified to suit the facts, 
not the facts to suit the theory. 
My opponents may point to medicine as a possible 
example of the opposite procedure. And yet if there 
is anything that the history of medical science dem- 
onstrates, it is that the first cues to new discoveries 
were made in the field of practice. Lymph therapy, 
which is one of the triumphs of modern medicine, was 
discovered empirically. It was an accident of practice, 
a blind procedure of trial and success that led to 
Jenner’s discovery of the virtues of vaccination. A 
century passed before theory adequately explained the 
phenomenon, and opened the way to those wider ap- 
plications of the principle that have done so much to 
reduce the ravages of disease. 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  
THE SUPERVISOR AND THE TEACHER 81 
The value of theory, I repeat, is to explain successful 
practice and to generalize experience in broad and 
comprehensive principles which can be easily held in 
mind, and from which inferences for further new and 
effective practices may be derived. We have a small 
body of sound principles in education to-day, — a body 
of principles that are thoroughly consistent with suc- 
cessful practice. But the sort of principles that are 
put forth as the last words of educational theory are 
often far from sound. Personally I firmly believe that 
a vast amount of damage is being done to children by 
the application of fallacious principles which, because 
they emanate from high authority, obtain an artificial 
validity in the minds of teachers in service. 
I cannot understand why, when an educational ex- 
periment fails lamentably, it is not rejected as a failure. 
And yet you and I know a number of instances where 
certain educational experiments that have undeniably 
reversed the hypotheses of those who initiated them 
are excused on the ground that conditions were not 
favorable. That, it seems to me, should tell the whole. 
story, for precisely what we need in educational prac- 
tice is a body of doctrine that will work where condi- 
tions are unfavorable. We are told that the successful 
application of mooted theories depends upon the proper 
kind of teachers. I maintain that the most effective 
sort of theory is the sort that brings results with such 
teachers as we must employ in our work. It would 
G
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
be a poor recommendation for a theory of medicine to 
say that it worked all right when people are healthy 
but failed to help the sick. Nor is it true that good 
teachers can get good results by following bad theory. 
They often obtain the results by evading the theory, 
and when they live up to it, the results faithfully re- 
flect the theory, no matter how skillful the teaching. 
I 
Statements like these are very apt to be miscon- 
strued or misinterpreted unless one is very careful to 
define one’s position; and, after what I have said, I 
should do myself an injustice if I did not make certain 
that my position is clear. I believe in experimentation 
in education. I believe in experimental schools. But 
I should wish these schools to be interpreted as experi- 
ments and not as models, and I should wish that the 
failure of an experiment be accepted with good, scien- 
tific grace, and not with the unscientific attitude of 
making excuses. The trouble with an experimental 
school is that, in the eyes of the great mass of teachers, 
it becomes a model school, and the principles that it 
represents are applied ad libitum by thousands of 
teachers who assume that they have heard the last 
word in educational theory. 
No one is more favorably disposed toward the rights 
of children than I am, and yet I am thoroughly con- 
vinced that soft-heartedness accompanied by soft- 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  THE SUPERVISOR AND THE TEACHER 83 
headedness is weakening the mental and moral fiber 
of hundreds of thousands of boys and girls through- 
out this country. No one admires more than I admire 
the sagacity and far-sightedness of Judge Lindsey, and 
yet when Judge Lindsey’s methods are proposed as 
models for school government, I cannot lose sight, as 
so many people seem to lose sight, of the contingent 
factor; namely, that Judge Lindsey’s leniency is based 
upon authority, and that if Judge Lindsey or any- 
body else attempted to be lenient when he had no 
power to be otherwise than lenient, his “bluff” 
would be called in short order. If you will give to 
teachers and principals the same power that you give 
to the police judge, you may well expect them to be 
lenient. The great trouble in the school is simply this: 
that just in the proportion that leniency is demanded, 
authority is taken away from the teacher. 
And I should perhaps say a qualifying word with 
regard to my attitude toward educational theory. I 
have every feeling of affection for the science of psy- 
chology. I have every faith in the value of psycho- 
logical principles in the interpretation of educational 
phenomena. But I also recognize that the science of 
psychology is a very young science, and that its data 
are not yet so well organized that it is safe to draw 
from them anything more than tentative hypotheses 
which must meet their final test in the crucible of prac- 
tice. Some day, if we work hard enough, psychology
-P-A-G-E-94
  84 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
will become a predictive science, just as mathematics 
and physics and chemistry and, to a certain extent, 
biology, are predictive sciences to-day. Meantime 
psychology is of inestimable value in giving us a point 
of view, in clarifying our ideas, and in rationalizing the 
truths that empirical practice discovers. A very few 
psychological principles are strongly enough established 
even now to form the basis of prediction. Among the 
most important of these are the laws of habit building, 
some laws of memory, and the larger principles of 
attention. Successful educational practice is and must 
be in accord with these indisputable tenets. But the 
bane of education to-day is in the pseudo-science, the 
“half-baked” psychology, that is lauded from the house- 
tops by untrained enthusiasts, turned from the presses 
by irresponsible publishing houses, and foisted upon the 
hungry teaching public through the ever-present medium 
of the reading circle, the teachers’ institute, the summer 
school, and I am very sorry to admit (for I think that 
I represent both institutions in a way) sometimes by 
the normal schools and universities. 
Most of the doctrines that are turning our practice 
topsy-turvy have absolutely no support from competent 
psychologists. The doctrine of spontaneity and its 
attendant Jaissez-faire dogma of school government is 
thoroughly inconsistent with good psychology. The 
radical extreme to which some educators would push 
the doctrine of interest when they maintain that the
-P-A-G-E-95
THE SUPERVISOR AND THE TEACHER 85 
child should never be asked to do anything for which 
he fails to find a need in his own life, — this doctrine 
can find no support in good psychology. The doctrine 
that the preadolescent child should understand thor- 
oughly every process that he is expected to reduce to 
habit before that process is made automatic is utterly 
at variance with long-established principles which were 
well understood by the Greeks and the Hebrews twenty- 
five hundred years ago, and to which Mother Nature 
herself gives the lie in the instincts of imitation and 
repetition. It is conceivable that these radical doc- 
trines were justified as means of reform, especially in 
secondary and higher education, but, even granting this, 
their function is fulfilled when the reform that they 
exploited has been accomplished. That time has come 
and, as palpable untruths, they should either be modified 
to meet the facts, or be relegated to oblivion. 
Til 
It is safe to say that formalism is no longer a 
characteristic feature of the typical American school. 
It is so long since I have heard any rote learning in a 
schoolroom that I am wondering if it is not almost 
time for some one to show that a little rote learning 
would not be at all a bad thing in preadolescent educa- 
tion. We ridicule the memoriter methods of Chinese 
education and yet we sometimes forget that Chinese
-P-A-G-E-96
    86 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
education has done something that no other system of 
education, however well planned, has even begun to do 
in the same degree. It has kept the Chinese empire a 
unit through a period of time compared with which the 
entire history of Greece and Rome is but an episode. 
We may ridicule the formalism of Hebrew education, 
and yet the schools of rabbis have preserved intact the 
racial integrity of the Jewish people during the two 
thousand years that have elapsed since their geographi- 
cal unity was destroyed. I am not justifying the 
methods of Chinese or Hebrew education. I am quite 
willing to admit that, in China at any rate, the game 
may not have been worth the candle; but I am still 
far from convinced that it is not a good thing for chil- 
dren to reduce to verbal form a good many things that 
are now never learned in such a way as to make any 
lasting impression upon the memory; and our criticism 
of oriental formalism is not so much concerned with the 
method of learning as with the content of learning, — 
not so much with learning by heart as with the char- 
acter of the material that was thus memorized. 
But, although formalism is no longer a distinctive 
feature of American education, formalism is the point 
from which education is most frequently attacked, — 
and this is the chief source of my dissatisfaction with 
the present-day critics of our elementary schools. In 
a great many cases, they have set up a man of straw 
and demolished him completely. And in demolishing
-P-A-G-E-97
  
THE SUPERVISOR AND THE TEACHER ™ 87 
him, they have incidentally knocked the props from 
under the feet of many a good teacher, leaving him 
dazed and uncertain of his bearings, stung with the con- 
viction that what he has been doing for his pupils is 
entirely without value, that his life of service has been 
a failure, that the lessons of his own experience are not 
to be trusted, nor the verdicts of his own intelligence 
respected. Go to any of the great summer schools and 
you will meet, among the attending teachers, hundreds 
of faithful, conscientious men and women who could 
tell you if they would (and some of them will) of the 
muddle in which their minds are left after some of the 
lectures to which they have listened. Why should they 
fail to be depressed? The whole weight of academic 
authority seems to be against them. The entire ma- 
chinery of educational administration is wheeling them 
with relentless force into paths that seem to them 
hopelessly intricate and bewildering. If it is true, as I 
think it is, that some of the proposals of modern edu- 
cation are an attempt to square the circle, it is certainly 
true that the classroom teacher is standing at the pres- 
sure points in this procedure. # 
We hear expressed on every side a great deal of sym- 
pathy for the child as the victim of our educational 
system. Sympathy for childhood is the most natural 
thing in the world. It is one of the basic human in- 
stincts, and its expressions are among the finest things 
in human life. But why limit our sympathy to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  
  88 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
child, especially to-day when he is about as happy and 
as fortunate an individual as anybody has ever been in 
all history. Why not let a little of it go out to the 
teacher of this child? Why not plan a little for her 
comfort and welfare and encouragement? It is her 
skill that is assimilating the children of our alien popu- 
lation. It is her strength that is lifting bodily each 
generation to the ever-advancing race levels. Her work 
must be the main source of the inspiration that will 
impel the race to further advancement. And yet when 
these half-million teachers who mean so much to this 
country gather at their institutes, when they attend 
the summer schools, when they take up their professional 
journals, what do they hear and read? Criticisms of their 
work. Denunciations of their methods. Serious doubts 
of their intelligence. Aspersions cast upon their sin- 
cerity, their patience, and their loyalty to their superiors. 
This, mingled with some mawkish sentimentalism that 
passes under the name of inspiration. Only occa- 
sionally a word of downright commendation, a sign of 
honest and heartfelt appreciation, a note of sympathy 
or encouragement. 
Carnegie gives fifteen million dollars to provide pen- 
sions for superannuated college professors; but the 
elementary teacher who is not fortunate enough to die 
in harness must look forward to the almshouse. The 
people tax themselves for magnificent buildings and 
luxurious furnishings, but-not one cent do they offer for
-P-A-G-E-99
    
THE SUPERVISOR AND THE TEACHER 89 
teachers’ pensions. What a blot upon Western civiliza- 
tion is this treatment of the teachers in our lower schools. 
These people are doing the work that even the savage 
races universally consider to be of the highest type. 
Benighted China places her teachers second only to the 
literati themselves in the place of honor. The Hindus 
made the teaching profession the highest caste in the 
social scale. The Jews intrusted the education of their 
children to their Rabbis, the most learned and the 
most honored of their race. It is only Western civili- 
zation —it is almost only our much-lauded Anglo- 
Saxon civilization — that denies to the teacher a sta- 
tion in life befitting his importance as a social servant. 
IV 
But what has all this to do with school supervision ? 
As I view it, the supervisor of schools as the overseer 
and director of the educational process, is just now 
confronted with two great problems. The first of these 
is to keep a clear head in the present muddled condition 
of educational theory. From the very fact of his posi- 
tion, the supervisor must be a leader, whether he will 
or not. It is a maxim of our profession that the prin- 
cipal is the school. In our city systems the supervising 
principal is given almost absolute authority over the 
school of which he has charge. In him is vested the 
ultimate responsibility for instruction, for discipline, for 
the care and condition of the material property. He  
-P-A-G-E-100
eM er Mae en ae rie ee ee DER Tee eee ete eee 
go CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
may be a despot if he wishes, benevolent or otherwise. 
With this power goes a corresponding opportunity. 
His school can stand for something, — perhaps for 
something new and strange which will bring him into 
the limelight to-day, no matter what its character; 
perhaps for something solid and enduring, something 
that will last long after his own name has been for- 
gotten. The temptation was never so strong as it is 
to-day for the supervisor to seek the former kind of 
glory. The need was never more acute than it is to-day 
for the supervisor who is content with the impersonal 
glory of the latter type. 
I admit that it is a somewhat thankless task to do 
things in a straightforward, effective way, without fuss 
or feathers, and I suppose that the applause of the 
gallery may be easily mistaken for the applause of the 
pit. But nevertheless the seeker for notoriety is doing 
the cause of education a vast amount of harm. I know 
a principal who won ephemeral fame by introducing 
into his school a form of the Japanese jiu-jitsu physical 
exercises. When I visited that school, I was led to 
believe that jiu-jitsu would be the salvation of the 
American people. Whole classes of girls and boys were 
marched to the large basement to be put through their 
paces for the delectation of visitors. The newspapers 
took it up and heralded it as another indication that~ 
the formalism of the public school was gradually break- 
ing down. Visitors came by the hundreds, and my

THE SUPERVISOR AND THE TEACHER gi 
friend basked in the limelight of public adulation while 
his colleagues turned green with envy and set them- 
selves to devising some means for turning attention in 
their direction. 
And yet, there are some principals who move on in 
the even tenor of their ways, year after year, while all 
these currents and countercurrents are seething and 
eddying around them. They hold fast to that which 
they know is good until that which they know is better 
can be found. They believe in the things that they do, 
so the chances are greatly increased that they will do 
them well. They refuse to be bullied or sneered at or 
laughed out of court because they do not take up with 
every"fancy that catches the popular mind. They have 
their own professional standards as to what constitutes 
competent schoolmanship, — their own standards gained 
from their own specialized experience. And somehow 
I cannot help thinking that just now that is the type 
of supervisor that we need and the type that ought 
to be encouraged. If I were talking to Chinese teach- 
ers, I might preach another sort of gospel, but Ameri- 
can education to-day needs less turmoil, less dis- 
traction, fewer sweeping changes. It needs to settle 
itself, and look around, and find out where it is and 
what it is trying to do. And it needs, above all, to rise 
to a consciousness of itself as an institution manned 
by intelligent individuals who are perfectly competent 
themselves to set up craft standard and ideals. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
IV 
But in whatever way the supervisor may utilize the 
opportunity that his position presents, his second great 
problem will come up for solution. The supervisor is 
the captain of the teaching corps. Directly under his 
control are the mainsprings of the school’s life and 
activity, — the classroom teachers. It is coming to be 
a maxim in the city systems that the supervisor has 
not only the power to mold the school to the form of 
his own ideals, but that he can, if he is skillful, turn 
weak teachers into strong teachers and make out of 
  
    most unpromising material, an efficient, homogeneous _   
school staff. I believe that this is coming to be con- 
sidered the prime criterion of effective school super- 
vision, — not what skill the supervisor may show in 
testing results, or in keeping his pupils up to a given 
standard, or in choosing his teachers skillfully, but 
rather the success with which he is able to take the 
teaching material that is at his hand, and train it into 
efficiency. 
A former Commissioner of Education for one of our 
new insular possessions once told me that he had come 
to divide supervisors into two classes, — (1) those who 
knew good teaching when they saw it, and (2) those 
who could make poor teachers into good teachers. Of 
these two types, he said, the latter were infinitely more 
valuable to pioneer work in education than the former,
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE SUPERVISOR AND THE TEACHER 93 
and he named two or three city systems from which he 
had selected the supervisors who could do this sort of 
thing, — for there is no limit to this process of training, 
and the superintendent who can train supervisors is 
just as important as the supervisor who can train 
teachers. 
It would take a volume adequately to treat the 
various problems that this conception of the super- 
visor’s function involves. I can do no more at present 
than indicate what seems to me the most pressing 
present need in this direction. I have found that 
sometimes the supervisors who insist most strenuously 
that their teachers secure the codperation of their pupils 
are among the very last to secure for themselves the 
codperation of their teachers. 
And to this important end, it seems to me that we 
have an important suggestion in the present condition 
of the classroom teacher as I have attempted to describe 
it. As a type, the classroom teacher needs just now 
some adequate appreciation and recognition of the work 
that she is doing. If the lay public is unable adequately 
to judge the teacher’s work, there is all the more reason 
that she should look to her supervisor for that recog- 
nition of technical skill, for that commendation of good 
work, which can come only from a fellow-craftsman, 
but which, when it does come, is worth more in the 
way of real inspiration than the loudest applause of the 
crowd.
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
Upon the whole, I believe that the outlook in this 
direction is encouraging. While the teacher may miss 
in her institutes and in the summer school that sort of 
encouragement, she is, I believe, finding it in larger 
and larger measure in the local teachers’ meetings and 
in her consultations with her supervisors. And when 
all has been said, that is the place from which she should 
look for inspiration. The teachers’ meeting must be 
the nursery of professional ideals. It must be a place 
where the real first-hand workers in education get that. 
sanity of outlook, that professional point of view, which 
shall fortify them effectively against the rising tide 
of unprofessional interference and dictation which, as I 
have tried to indicate, constitutes the most serious 
menace to our educational welfare. 
And it is in the encouragement of this craft spirit, in 
this lifting of the teacher’s calling to the plane of craft 
consciousness, it is in this that the supervisor must, I 
believe, find the true and lasting reward for his work. 
It is through this factor that he can, just now, work the 
greatest good for the schools that he supervises and the 
community that he serves. The most effective way to 
reach his pupils is through the medium of their teachers, 
and he can help these pupils in no better way than to 
give their teachers a justifiable pride in the work that 
they are doing through his own recognition of its worth 
and its value, through his own respect for the significance 
of the lessons that experience teaches them, through his
-P-A-G-E-105
  
  THE SUPERVISOR AND THE TEACHER 95 
own suggestive help in making that experience profit- 
able and suggestive. And just at the present moment, 
he can make no better start than by assuring them of 
the truth that Emerson expresses when he defines the 
true scholar as the man who remains firm in his belief 
that a popgun is only a popgun although the ancient 
and honored of earth may solemnly affirm it to be the 
crack of doom.

I 
I wisH to discuss with you some phases of the prob- 
lem that is perhaps foremost in the minds of the teach- 
ing public to-day: the problem, namely, of making edy- ~ 
cation bear more directly and more effectively upon the 
work of practical, everyday life. I have no doubt 
that some of you feel, when this problem is suggested, 
very much as I felt when I first suggested to my- 
self the possibility of discussing it with you. You 
have doubtless heard some phases of this problem dis- 
cussed at every meeting of this association for the past 
ten years — if you have been a member so long as that. 
Certain it is that we all grow weary of the reiteration 
of even the best of truths, but certain it is also that 
some problems are always before us, and until they are 
solved satisfactorily they will always stimulate men to 
devise means for their solution. 
I should say at the outset, however, that I shall not 
attempt to justify to this audience the introduction of 
1 An address before the Eastern Illinois Teachers’ Association, October 
1g, 1909. Published as a Bulletin of the Eastern Illinois Normal School,

vocational subjects into the elementary and secondary 
curriculums. I shall take it for granted that you have 
already made up your minds upon this matter. I shall 
not take your time in an attempt to persuade you that 
agriculture ought to be taught in the rural schools, or 
manual training and domestic science in all schools. I 
am personally convinced of the value of such work and _ 
I shall take it for granted that you are likewise con- 
vinced. 
My task to-day, then, is of another type. I wish to 
discuss with you some of the implications of this matter 
of utility in respect of the work that every elementary 
school is doing and always must do, no matter how 
much hand work or vocational material it may intro- 
duce. My problem, in other words, concerns the ordi- 
nary subject-matter of the curriculum, — reading and 
writing and arithmetic, geography and grammar and 
history, — those things which, like the poor, are always 
with us, but which we seem a little ashamed to talk 
about in public. Truly, from reading the educational 
journals and hearing educational discussion to-day, the 
layman might well infer that what we term the ‘useful ” 
education and the education that is now offered by the 
average school are as far apart as the two poles. We 
are all familiar with the statement that the elementary 
curriculum is eminently adapted to produce clerks and 
accountants, but very poorly adapted to furnish re- 
cruits for any other department of life. The high

school is criticized on the ground that it prepares for 
college and consequently for the professions, but that it 
is totally inadequate to the needs of the average citizen. 
Now it would be futile to deny that there is some truth 
in both these assertions, but I do not hesitate to affirm 
that both are grossly exaggerated, and that the cur- 
riculum of to-day, with all its imperfections, does not 
justify so sweeping a denunciation. I wish to point 
out some of the respects in which these charges are 
fallacious, and, in so doing, perhaps, to suggest some 
possible remedies for the defects that every one will 
acknowledge. 
I 
In the first place, let me make myself perfectly clear 
upon what I mean by the word ‘Qseful.” What, after 
all, is the “useful” study in our schools? What do 
men find to be the useful thing in their lives? The 
most natural answer to this question is that the useful 
things are those that enable us to meet effectively the 
conditions of life) — or, to use a phrase that is per- 
fectly clear to us all, the things that help us in getting 
a living. The vast majority of men and women in this 
world measure all values by this standard, for most of 
us are, to use the expressive slang of the day, “up 
against” this problem, and “up against” it so hard 
‘and so constantly that we interpret everything in the 
greatly foreshortened perspective of immediate neces- 
sity. Most of us in this room are confronting this
-P-A-G-E-109
  EDUCATION AND UTILITY 99° 
problem of making a living. At any rate, I am con- 
: fronting it, and consequently I may lay claim to some 
of the authority that comes from experience. 
And since I have made this personal reference, may 
I violate the canons of good taste and make still an- 
other? I was face to face with this problem of getting 
a living a good many years ago, when the opportunity 
came to me to take a college course. I could see noth- 
ing ahead after that except another struggle with this 
same vital issue. So I decided to take a college course 
which would, in all probability, help me to solve the 
problem. Scientific agriculture was not developed in 
those days as it has been since that time, but a‘start 
had been made, and the various agricultural colleges 
were offering what seemed to be very practical courses. 
I had had some early experience on the farm, and I 
decided to become a scientific farmer. I took the 
course of four years and secured my degree. The 
course was as useful from the standpoint of practical 
agriculture as any that could have been devised at the 
time. But when I graduated, what did I find? The 
same old problem of getting a living still confronted me 
as I had expected that it would; and alas! I had 
got my education in a profession that demanded 
capital. I was a landless farmer. Times were hard 
and work of all kinds was very scarce. The farmers of 
those days were inclined to scoff at scientific agriculture. 
I could have worked for my board and a little more,
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
and I should have done so had I been able to find a job. 
But while I was looking for the place, a chance came 
to.teach school, and I took the opportunity as a means 
of keeping the wolf from the door. I have been en- 
gaged in the work of teaching ever since. When I was 
able to buy land, I did so, and I have to-day a farm of 
which I am very proud. It does not pay large divi- 
dends, but I keep it up for the fun I get out of it, — 
and I like to think, also, that if I should lose my job as 
a teacher, I could go back to the farm and show the 
natives how to make money. This is doubtless an 
illusion, but it is a source of solid comfort just the 
same. 
Now the point of this experience is simply this: I 
secured an education that seemed to me to promise the 
acme of utility. In one way, it has fulfilled that promise 
far beyond my wildest expectations, but that way was 
very different from the one that I had anticipated. 
The technical knowledge that I gained during those 
four strenuous years, I apply now only as a means of 
recreation. So far as enabling me directly to get a 
living, this technical knowledge does not pay one per 
cent on the investment of time and money. And yet 
I count the training that I got from its mastery as, 
perhaps, the most useful product of my education. 
Now what was the secret of its utility? As I analyze 
my experience, I find it summed up very largely in two 
factors. In the first place, I studied a set of subjects
-P-A-G-E-111
  
EDUCATION AND UTILITY Ior 
for which I had at the outset very little taste. In study- 
ing agriculture, I had to master a certain amount of 
chemistry, physics, botany, and zodlogy, for each and 
every one of which I felt, at the outset, a distinct aver- 
sion and dislike. A mastery of these subjects was 
essential to a realization of the purpose that I had in 
mind. I was sure that I should never like them, and 
yet, as I kept at work, I gradually found myself losing 
that initial distaste. First one and then another opened 
out its vista of truth and revelation before me, and 
almost before I was aware of it, I was enthusiastic 
over science. It was a long time before I generalized 
that experience and drew its lesson, but the lesson, once 
learned, has helped me more even in the specific task 
of getting a living than anything else that came out of 
my school training. That experience taught me, not 
only the necessity for doing disagreeable tasks, — for 
attacking them hopefully and cheerfully, — but it also 
taught me that disagreeable tasks, if attacked in the 
right way, and persisted in with patience, often become 
attractive in themselves. Over and over again in meet- 
ing the situations of real life, I have been confronted 
with tasks that were initially distasteful. Sometimes I 
have surrendered before them; but sometimes, too, 
that lesson has come back to me, and has inspired me 
to struggle on, and at no time has it disappointed me 
by the outcome. I repeat that there is no technical 
knowledge that I have gained that compares for a 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
    102 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
moment with that ideal of patience and persistence. 
When it comes to real, downright utility, measured by 
this inexorable standard of getting a living, let me 
commend to you the ideal of persistent effort. All the 
knowledge that we can learn or teach will come to very 
little if this element is lacking. 
Now this is very far from saying that the pursuit of 
really useful knowledge may not give this ideal just as 
effectively as the pursuit of knowledge that will never 
be used. My point is simply this: that beyond the 
immediate utility of the facts that we teach, — indeed, 
basic and fundamental to this utility, —is the utility 
of the ideals and standards that are derived from our 
school work. Whatever we teach, these essential fac- 
tors can be made to stand out in our work, and if 
our pupils acquire these we shall have done the basic 
and important thing in helping them to solve the prob- 
lems of real life, — and if our pupils do not acquire these, 
it will make little difference how intrinsically valuable 
may be the content of our instruction. I feel like em- 
phasizing this matter to-day, because there is in the air 
a notion that utility depends entirely upon the content 
of the curriculum. Certainly the curriculum must be 
improved from this standpoint, but we are just now 
losing sight of the other equally important factor, — 
that, after all, while both are essential, it is the spirit of 
teaching rather than the content of teaching that is 
basic and fundamental.
-P-A-G-E-113
  
EDUCATION AND UTILITY 103 
Nor have I much sympathy with that extreme view of 
this matter which asserts that we must go out of our 
way to provide distasteful tasks for the pupil in order 
to develop this ideal of persistence. I believe that such 
a policy will always tend to defeat its own purpose. I 
know a teacher who holds this belief. He goes out of 
his way to make tasks difficult. He refuses to help 
pupils over hard places. He does not believe in careful 
assignments of lessons, because, he maintains, the pupil 
ought to learn to overcome difficulties for himself, and 
how can he learn unless real difficulties are presented ? 
The great trouble with this teacher is that his policy 
does not work out in practice. A small minority of his 
pupils are strengthened by it; the majority are weakened. 
He is right when he says that a pupil gains strength only 
by overcoming difficulties, but he neglects a very impor- 
tant qualification of this rule, namely, that a pupil gains 
no strength out of obstacles that he fails to overcome. It 
is the conquest that comes after effort, — this is the 
factor that gives one strength and confidence. But when 
defeat follows defeat and failure follows failure, it is 
weakness that is being engendered — not strength. 
And that is the trouble with this teacher’s pupils. The 
majority leave him with all confidence in their own ability 
shaken out of them and some of them never recover from 
the experience. 
And so while I insist strenuously that the most useful 
lesson we can teach our pupils is how to do disagreeable
-P-A-G-E-114
104 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
tasks cheerfully and willingly, please do not understand 
me to mean that we should go out of our way to provide 
disagreeable tasks. After all, I rejoice that my own 
children are learning how to read and write and cipher 
much more easily, much more quickly, and withal much 
more pleasantly than I learned those useful arts. The 
more quickly they get to the plane that their elders have 
reached, the more quickly they can get beyond this plane 
and on to the next level. 
To argue against improved methods in teaching on the 
ground that they make things too easy for the pupil is, 
to my mind, a grievous error. It is as fallacious as to 
argue that the introduction of machinery is a curse be- 
cause it has diminished in some measure the necessity 
for human drudgery. But if machinery left mankind to 
rest upon its oars, if it discouraged further progress and 
further effortful achievement, it would be a curse: and if 
the easier and quicker methods of instruction simply 
bring my children to my own level and then fail to stimu- 
late them to get beyond my level, then they are a curse 
and not a blessing. 
I do not decry that educational policy of to-day 
which insists that school work should be made as simple 
and attractive as possible. I do decry that misinter- 
pretation of this policy which looks at the matter from 
the other side, and asserts so vehemently that the child 
should never be asked or urged to do something that is 
not easy and attractive. It is only because there is so 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
EDUCATION AND UTILITY 105 
much in the world to be done that, for the sake of 
economizing time and strength, we should raise the child 
as quickly and as rapidly and as pleasantly as possible 
to the plane that the race has reached. But among all 
the lessons of race experience that we must teach him 
there is none so fundamental and important as the lesson 
of achievement itself, —the supreme lesson wrung from 
human experience, — the lesson, namely, that every ad- 
vance that the world has made, every step that it has 
taken forward, every increment that has been added to 
the sum total of progress has been attained at the price of 
self-sacrifice and effort and struggle, — at the price of 
doing things that one does not want todo. And unless a 
man is willing to pay that price, he is bound to be the 
worst kind of a social parasite, for he is simply living on 
the experience of others, and adding to this capital noth- 
ing of his own. 
It is sometimes said that universal education is essen- 
tial in order that the great mass of humanity may live in 
greater comfort and enjoy the luxuries that in the past 
have been vouchsafed only to the few. Personally I 
think that this is all right so far as it goes, but it fails to 
reach an ultimate goal. Material comfort is justified 
only because it enables mankind to live more effectively 
on the lower planes of life and give greater strength and 
greater energy to the solution of new problems upon the 
higher planes of life. The end of life can never be ade- 
quately formulated in terms of comfort and ease, nor 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
even in terms of culture and intellectual enjoyment; 
the end of life is achievement, and no matter how far we 
go, achievement is possible only to those who are willing 
to pay the price. When the race stops investing its capi- 
tal of experience in further achievement, when it settles 
down to take life easily, it will not take it very long to 
eat up its capital and revert to the plane of the brute. 
III 
But Iam getting away from my text. You will remem- 
ber that I said that the most useful thing that we can 
teach the child is to attack strenuously and resolutely 
any problem that confronts him whether it pleases him 
or not, and I wanted to be certain that you did not mis- 
interpret me to mean that we should, for this reason, 
  make our school tasks unnecessarily difficult and labori- 
ous. After all, while our attitude should always be one 
of interesting our pupils, their attitude should always be 
one of effortful attention, — of willingness to do the task 
that we think it best for them todo. You see it is a sort 
of a double-headed policy, and how to carry it out is a 
perplexing problem. Of so much I am certain, however, 
at the outset: if the pupil takes the attitude that we are 
there to interest and entertain him, we shall make a sorry 
fiasco of the whole matter, and inasmuch as this very 
tendency is in the air at the present time, I feel justified 
in at least referring to its danger. 
Now if this ideal of persistent effort is the most useful
-P-A-G-E-117
  EDUCATION AND UTILITY 107 
thing that can come out of education, what is the next 
most useful? Again, as I analyze what I obtained from 
my own education, it seems to me that, next to learning 
that disagreeable tasks are often well worth doing, the 
factor that has helped me most in getting a living has 
been the method of solving the situations that confronted 
me. After all, if we simply have the ideal of resolute and 
aggressive and persistent attack, we may struggle indefi- 
nitely without much result. All problems of life involve 
certain common factors. The essential difference be- 
tween the educated and the uneducated man, if we 
grant each an equal measure of pluck, persistence, and 
endurance, lies in the superior ability of the educated 
man to analyze his problem effectively and to proceed 
intelligently rather than blindly to its solution. I 
maintain that education should give a man this ideal 
of attacking any problem; furthermore I maintain that 
the education of the present day, in spite of the 
anathemas that are hurled against it, is doing this in 
richer measure than it has ever been done before. But 
there is no reason why we should not do it in still 
greater measure. 
I once knew two men who were in the business of raising 
fruit for commercial purposes. Each had a large orchard 
which he operated according to conventional methods 
and which netted him a comfortable income. One of 
these men was a man of narrow education: the other a 
man of liberal education, although his training had not  
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
been directed in any way toward the problems of horti- 
culture. The orchards had borne exceptionally well for 
several years, but one season, when the fruit looked 
especially promising, a period of wet, muggy weather 
came along just before the picking season, and one morn- 
ing both these men went out into their orchards, to find 
the fruit very badly ‘“‘specked.” Now the conventional 
thing to do in such cases was well known to both men. 
Each had picked up a good deal of technical information 
about caring for fruit, and each did the same thing in 
meeting this situation. He got out his spraying outfit, 
prepared some Bordeaux mixture, and set vigorously at 
work with his pumps. So far as persistence and enter- 
prise went, both men stood on an equal footing. But it 
happened that this was an unusual and not a conventional 
situation. The spraying did not alleviate the condition. 
The corruption spread through the trees like wildfire, 
and seemed to thrive on copper sulphate rather than suc- 
cumb to its corrosive influence. 
Now this was where the difference in training showed 
itself. The orchardist who worked by rule of thumb, 
when he found that his rule did not work, gave up the 
fight and spent his time sitting on his front porch be- 
moaning his luck. The other set diligently at work to 
analyze the situation. His education had not taught him 
anything about the characteristics of parasitic fungi, for 
parasitic fungi were not very well understood when he was 
in school. But his education had left with him a general 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
EDUCATION AND UTILITY tog 
method of procedure for just such cases, and that method 
he at once applied. It had taught him how to find the 
information that he needed, provided that such informa- 
tion was available. It had taught him that human experi- 
ence is crystallized in books, and that, when a discovery is 
made in any field of science, — no matter how specialized 
the field and no matter how trivial the finding, — the dis- 
covery is recorded in printer’s ink and placed at the dis- 
posal of those who have the intelligence to find it and apply 
it. And so he set out to read up on the subject, — to 
see what other men had learned about this peculiar kind 
of apple rot. He obtained all that had been written 
about it and began to masterit. He told his friend about 
this material and suggested that the latter follow the 
same course, but the man of narrow education soon found 
himself utterly at sea in a maze of technical terms. The 
terms were new to the other too, but he took down his 
dictionary and worked them out. He knew how to use 
indices and tables of contents and various other devices 
that facilitate the gathering of information, and while his 
uneducated friend was storming over the pedantry of 
men who use big words, the other was making rapid prog- 
ress through the material. In a short time he learned 
everything that had been found out about this specific 
disease. He learned that its spores are encased in a ge- 
latinous sac which resisted the entrance of the chemicals. 
He found how the spores were reproduced, how they 
wintered, how they germinated in the following season ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  
  IIo CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
and, although he did not save much of his crop that year, 
he did better the next. Nor were the evidences of his 
superiority limited to this very useful result. He found 
that, after all, very little was known about this disease, 
so he set himself to find out more about it. To do this, 
he started where other investigators had left off, and then 
he applied a principle he had learned from his education; 
namely, that the only valid methods of obtaining new 
truths are the methods of close observation and con- 
trolled experiment. 
Now I maintain that the education which was given 
that man was effective in a degree that ought to make his 
experience an object lesson for us who teach. What he 
had found most useful at a very critical juncture of his 
business life was, primarily, not the technical knowledge 
that he had gained either in school or in actual experience. 
His superiority lay in the fact that he knew how to get 
hold of knowledge when he needed it, how to master it 
once he had obtained it, how to apply it once he had 
mastered it, and finally how to go about to discover facts 
that had been undetected by previous investigators. I 
care not whether he got this knowledge in the elementary 
school or in the high school or in the college. He might 
have secured it in any one of the three types of institution, 
but he had to learn it somewhere, and I shall go further 
and say that the average man has to learn it in some 
school and under an explicit and conscious method of in- 
struction.

But perhaps you would maintain that this statement of 
the case, while in general true, does not help us out in 
practice. After all, how are we to impress pupils with this 
ideal of persistence and with these ideals of getting and 
applying information, and with this ideal of investiga- 
tion? Imaintain that these important useful ideals 
may be effectively impressed almost from the very outset 
of school life. The teaching of every subject affords in- 
numerable opportunities to force home their lessons. In 
fact, it must be a very gradual process — a process in 
which the concrete instances are numerous and rich and 
impressive. From these concrete instances, the general 
truth may in time emerge. Certainly the chances that 
it will emerge are greatly multiplied if we ourselves 
recognize its worth and importance, and lead our pupils 
to see in each concrete case the operation of the general 
principle. After all, the chief reason why so much of our 
education miscarries, why so few pupils gain the strength 
and the power that we expect all to gain, lies in the in- 
ability of the average individual to draw a general con- 
clusion from concrete cases — to see the general in the 
particular. We have insisted so strenuously upon con- 
crete instruction that we have perhaps failed also to 
insist that fact without law is blind, and that observation 
without induction is stupidity gone to seed. 
Let me give a concrete instance of what I mean. Not 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
    I12 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
long ago, I visited an eighth-grade class during a geog- 
raphy period. It was at the time when the discovery of 
the Pole had just set the whole civilized world by the ears, 
and the teacher was doing something that many good 
teachers do on occasions of this sort: she was turning the 
vivid interest of the moment to educative purposes. 
The pupils had read Peary’s account of his trip and they 
were discussing its details in class. Now that exercise 
was vastly more than an interesting information lesson, 
for Peary’s achievement became, under the skillful touch 
of that teacher, a type of all human achievement. I wish 
that I could reproduce that lesson for you — how vividly 
she pictured the situation that confronted the explorer, — 
the bitter cold, the shifting ice, the treacherous open leads, 
the lack of game or other sources of food supply, the long 
marches on scant rations, the short hours and the un- 
comfortable conditions of sleep; and how from these 
that fundamental lesson of pluck and endurance and 
courage came forth naturally without preaching the moral 
or indulging in sentimental ‘“goody-goodyism.” And 
then the other and equally important part of the lesson, 
— how pluck and courage in themselves could never have 
solved the problem; how knowledge was essential, and , 
how that knowledge had been gained : some of it from the 
experience of early explorers, — how to avoid the dreaded 
scurvy, how to build a ship that could withstand the tre- 
mendous pressure of the floes; and some from the Eski- 
mos, — how to live in that barren region, and how to
-P-A-G-E-123
EDUCATION AND UTILITY 113 
travel with dogs and sledges;— and some, too, from 
Peary’s own early experiences, — how he had struggled 
for twenty years to reach the goal, and had added this 
experience to that until finally the prize was his. We 
may differ as to the value of Peary’s deed, but that it 
stands as a type of what success in any undertaking 
means, no one can deny. And this was the lesson that 
these eighth-grade pupils were absorbing, — the world-old 
lesson before which all others fade into insignificance, — 
the lesson, namely, that achievement can be gained only 
by those who are willing to pay the price. 
And I imagine that when that class is studying the con- 
tinent of Africa in their geography work, they will learn 
something more than the names of rivers and mountains 
and boundaries and products, — I imagine that they will 
link these facts with the names and deeds of the men who 
gave them to the world. And when they study history, 
it will be vastly more than a bare recital of dates and 
events, —it will be alive with these great lessons of 
struggle and triumph, — for history, after all, is only the 
record of human achievement. And if those pupils do not 
find these same lessons coming out of their own little con- 
quests, — if the problems of arithmetic do not furnish an 
opportunity to conquer the pressure ridges of partial 
payments or the Polar night of bank discount, or if the in- 
tricacies of formal grammar do not resolve themselves 
into the North Pole of correct expression, — I have mis- 
judged that teacher’s capacities; for the great triumph 
I  
-P-A-G-E-124
  II4 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
of teaching is to get our pupils to see the fundamental 
and the eternal in things that are seemingly trivial and 
transitory. We are fond of dividing school studies into 
the cultural and the practical, into the humanities and 
the sciences. Believe me, there is no study worth the 
teaching that is not practical at basis, and there is no 
practical study that has not its human interest and its 
humanizing influence — if only we go to some pains to 
search them out. 
Vv 
I have said that the most useful thing that education 
can do is to imbue the pupil with the ideal of effortful 
achievement which will lead him to do cheerfully and 
effectively the disagreeable tasks that fall to his lot. 
have said that the next most useful thing that it can do 
is to give him a general method of solving the problems 
that he meets. Is there any other useful outcome of a 
general nature that we may rank in importance with these 
two? I believe that there is, and I can perhaps tell you 
what I mean by another reference to a concrete case. 
I know a man who lacks this third factor, although he 
possesses the other two in a very generous measure. He 
is full of ambition, persistence, and courage. He is 
master of the rational method of solving the problems 
that beset him. He does his work intelligently and 
effectively. And yet he has failed to make a good living. 
Why? Simply because of his standard of what consti- 
tutes a good living. Measured by my standard, he is
-P-A-G-E-125
  
EDUCATION AND UTILITY TI5 
doing excellently well. Measured by his own standard, 
he is a miserable failure. He is depressed and gloomy 
and out of harmony with the world, simply because he 
has no other standard for a good living than a financial 
one. He is by profession a civil engineer. His work 
is much more remunerative than is that of many other 
callings. He has it in him to attain to professional dis- 
tinction in that work. But to this opportunity he is 
blind. In the great industrial center in which he works, 
he is constantly irritated by the evidences of wealth and 
luxury beyond what he himself enjoys. The millionaire 
captain of industry is his hero, and because he is not 
numbered among this class, he looks at the world through 
the bluest kind of spectacles. 
Now, to my mind that man’s education failed some- 
where, and its failure lay in the fact that it did not 
develop in him ideals of success that would have made 
him immune to these irritating factors. We have often 
heard it said that education should rid the mind of the 
incubus of superstition, and one very important effect of 
universal education is that it does offer to all men an 
explanation of the phenomena that formerly weighted 
down the mind with fear and dread, and opened an easy 
ingress to the forces of superstition and fraud and error. 
Education has accomplished this function, I think, pas- 
sably well with respect to the more obvious sources of 
superstition. Necromancy and magic, demonism and 
witchcraft, have long since been relegated to the limbo of
-P-A-G-E-126
  
116 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
exposed fraud. Their conquest has been one of the most 
significant advances that man has made above the 
savage. The truths of science have at last triumphed, 
and, as education has diffused these truths among the 
masses, the triumph has become almost universal. 
But there are other forms of superstition besides those 
I have mentioned, — other instances of a false perspec- 
tive, of distorted values, of inadequate standards. If 
belief in witchcraft or in magic is bad because it falls 
short of an adequate interpretation of nature, — if it is 
false because it is inconsistent with human experience, — 
then the worship of Mammon that my engineer friend 
represents is tenfold worse than witchcraft, measured by 
the same standards. If there is any lesson that human 
history teaches with compelling force, it is surely this: 
Every race which has yielded to the demon of individual- 
ism and the lust for gold and self-gratification has gone 
down the swift and certain road to national decay. 
Every race that, through unusual material prosperity, 
has lost its grip on the eternal verities of self-sacrifice 
and self-denial has left the lesson of its downfall written 
large upon the pages of history. I repeat that if super- 
stition consists in believing something that is incon- 
sistent with rational human experience, then our present 
worship of the golden calf is by far the most dangerous 
form of superstition that has ever befuddled the human 
intellect. 
But, you ask, what can education do to alleviate a
-P-A-G-E-127
  
EDUCATION AND UTILITY I17 
condition of this sort? How may the weak influence of 
the school make itself felt in an environment that has 
crystallized on every hand this unfortunate standard? 
Individualism is in the air. It is the dominant spirit 
of the times. It is reénforced upon every side by the 
unmistakable evidences of national prosperity. Itis easy 
to preach the simple life, but who will live it unless he 
has to? It is easy to say that man should have social 
and not individual standards of success and achieve- 
ment, but what effect will your puerile assertion have 
upon the situation that confronts us ? 
Yes; it is easier to be a pessimist than an optimist. It 
is far easier to lie back and let things run their course than 
it is to strike out into midstream and make what must be 
for the pioneer a fatal effort to stem the current. But is 
the situation absolutely hopeless? If the forces of educa- 
tion-can lift the Japanese people from barbarism to en- 
lightenment in two generations; if education can in a 
single century transform Germany from the weakest to 
the strongest power on the continent of Europe; if five 
short years of a certain type of education can change the 
course of destiny in China ;— are we warranted in our 
assumption that we hold a weak weapon in this fight 
against Mammon ? 
I have intimated that the attitude of my engineer 
friend toward life is the result of twisted ideals. A good 
many young men are going out into life with a similar 
defect in their education. They gain their ideals, not 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
    118 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
from the great wellsprings of human experience as 
represented in history and literature, in religion and art, 
but from the environment around them, and consequently 
they become victims of this superstition from the outset. 
As a trainer of teachers, I hold it to be one important part 
of my duty to fortify my students as strongly as I can 
against this false standard of which my engineer friend is 
the victim. It is just as much a part of my duty to give 
my students effective and consistent standards of what a 
good living consists in as it is to give them the technical 
knowledge and skill that will enable them to make a good 
living. If my students who are to become teachers have 
standards of living and standards of success that are 
inconsistent with the great ideal of social service for which 
teaching stands, then I have fallen far short of success 
in my work. If they are constantly irritated by the evi- 
dences of luxury beyond their means, if this irritation 
sours their dispositions and checks their spontaneity, their 
efficiency as teachers is greatly lessened or perhaps en- 
tirely negated. And if my engineer friend places worldly 
emoluments upon a higher plane than professional effi- 
ciency, I dread for the safety of the bridges that he builds. 
His education as an engineer should have fortified him 
against just such a contingency. It should have left 
him with the ideal of craftsmanship supreme in his life. 
And if his technical education failed to do this, his general 
education ought, at least, to have given him a bias in the 
right direction.
-P-A-G-E-129
  EDUCATION AND UTILITY TIg 
I believe that all forms of vocational and professional 
education are not so strong in this respect as they should 
be. Again you say to me, What can education do 
when the spirit of the times speaks so strongly on the 
other side? But what is education for if it is not to pre- 
serve midst the chaos and confusion of troublous times the 
great truths that the race has wrung from its experience ? 
How different might have been the fate of Rome, if Rome 
had possessed an educational system touching every child 
in the Empire, and if, during the years that witnessed her 
decay and downfall, those schools could have kept steadily, 
persistently at work, impressing upon every member of 
each successive generation the virtues that made the 
old Romans strong and virile — the virtues that enabled 
them to lay the foundations of an empire that crumbled 
in ruins once these truths were forgotten. Is it not the 
specific task of education to represent in each generation 
the human experiences that have been tried and tested 
and found to work, — to represent these in the face of 
opposition if need be, — to be faithful to the trusteeship 
of the most priceless legacy that the past has left to the 
present and to the future? If this is not our function in 
the scheme of things, then what is our function? Is it to 
stand with bated breath to catch the first whisper that will 
usher in the next change? Is it to surrender all initiative 
and simply allow ourselves to be tossed hither and yon by 
the waves and cross-waves of a fickle public opinion ? 
Is it to cower in dread of a criticism that is not only unjust  
-P-A-G-E-130
  120 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
but often ill-advised of the real conditions under which we 
are doing our work ? 
I take it that none of us is ready to answer these ques- 
tions in the affirmative. Deep down in our hearts we 
know that we have a useful work to do, and we know that 
we are doing it passably well. We also know our defects 
and shortcomings at least as well as one who has never 
faced our problems and tried to solve them. And it is 
from this latter type that most of the drastic criticism, 
especially of the elementary and secondary school, ema- 
nates. I confess that my gorge rises within me when I 
read or hear the invectives that are being hurled against 
teaching as a profession (and against the work of the 
elementary and secondary school in particular) by men 
who know nothing of this work at first hand. This is 
the greatest handicap under which the profession of teach- 
ing labors. In every other important field of human ac- 
tivity a man must present his credentials before he takes 
his seat at the council table, and even then he must sit 
and listen respectfully to his elders for a while before he 
ventures a criticism or even asuggestion. This plan may 
have its defects. It may keep things on too consery- 
ative a basis; but it avoids the danger into which we as 
a profession have fallen, — the danger of “half-baked” 
theories and unmatured policies. To-day the only man 
that can get a respectable hearing at our great national 
educational meetings is the man who has something new 
and bizarre to propose. And the more startling the pro-
-P-A-G-E-131
  
EDUCATION AND UTILITY 121 
posal, the greater is the measure of adulation that he - 
receives. The result of this is a continual straining for 
effect, an enormous annual crop of fads and fancies, 
which, though most of them are happily short-lived, keep 
us in a state of continual turmoil and confusion. 
Now, it goes without saying that there are many ways 
of making education hit the mark of utility in addition to 
those that I have mentioned. The teachers down in the 
lower grades who are teaching little children the arts of 
reading and writing and computation are doing vastly 
more in a practical direction than they are ever given 
credit for doing ; for reading and writing and the manipu- 
lation of numbers are, next to oral speech itself, the prime 
necessities in the social and industrial world. These arts 
are being taught to-day better than they have ever been 
taught before, — and the technique of their teaching is 
undergoing constant refinement and improvement. 
The school can do and is doing other useful things. 
Some schools are training their pupils to be well mannered 
and courteous and considerate of the rights of others. 
They are teaching children one of the most basic and 
fundamental laws of human life; namely, that there 
are some things that a gentleman cannot do and some 
things that society will not stand. How many a painful 
experience in solving this very problem of getting a living 
could be avoided if one had only learned this lesson pass- 
ing well! What a pity it is that some schools that stand 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  122 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
to-day for what we call educational progress are failing in 
just this particular — are sending out into the world an 
annual crop of boys and girls who must learn the great 
lesson of self-control and a proper respect for the rights of 
others in the bitter school of experience, —a school in 
which the rod will never be spared, but whose chasten- 
ing scourge comes sometimes, alas, too late ! 
There is no feature of school life which has not its 
almost infinite possibilities of utility. But after all, are 
not the basic and fundamental things these ideals that I 
have named? And should not we who teach stand for 
idealism in its widest sense? Should we not ourselves 
subscribe an undying fidelity to those great ideals for 
which teaching must stand, — to the ideal of social serv- 
ice which lies at the basis of our craft, to the ideals 
of effort and discipline that make a nation great and its 
children strong, to the ideal of science that dissipates the 
black night of ignorance and superstition, to the ideal of 
culture that humanizes mankind ?

I know that I do not need to plead with this audience 
for a recognition of the scientific spirit in the solution 
of educational problems. The long life and the en- 
viable record of this Society of Pedagogy testify in 
themselves to that spirit of free inquiry, to the calm 
and dispassionate search for the truth which lies at 
the basis of the scientific method. You have gathered 
here, fortnight after fortnight, to discuss educational 
problems in the light of your experience. You have 
reported your experience and listened to the results 
that others have gleaned in the course of their daily 
work. And experience is the corner stone of science. 
Some of the most stimulating and clarifying discus- 
sions of educational problems that I have ever heard have 
been made in the sessions of this Society. You have 
been scientific in your attitude toward education, and 
I may add that I first learned the lessons of the real 
science of education in the St. Louis schools, and under 
the inspiration that was furnished by the men who

were members of this Society. What I knew of the 
science of education before I came to this city ten years 
ago, was gleaned largely from books. It was deductive, 
a priori, in its nature. What I learned here was the 
induction from actual experience. 
My very first introduction to my colleagues among 
the school men of this city was a lesson in the science of 
education. I had brought with me a letter to one of 
your principals. He was in the office down on Locust 
Street the first Saturday that I spent in the city. I 
presented my letter to him, and, with that true Southern 
hospitality which has always characterized your corps, 
he took me immediately under his wing and carried me 
out to luncheon with him. 
We sat for hours in a little restaurant down on Sixth 
Street, — he was my teacher and I was his pupil. And 
gradually, as the afternoon wore on, I realized that I 
had met a master craftsman in the art of education. 
At first I talked glibly enough of what I intended to do, 
and he listened sympathetically and helpfully, with a 
little quizzical smile in his eyes as I outlined my am- 
bitious plans. And when I had run the gamut of my 
dreams, he took his turn, and, in true Socratic fashion, 
yet without making me feel in the least that I was 
only a dreamer after all, he refashioned my theories. 
One by one the little card houses that I had built up 
were deftly, smoothly, gently, but completely demolished. 
I did not know the A B C of schoolcraft — but he did
-P-A-G-E-135
THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION 125 
not tell me that I did not. He went at the task of. 
instruction from the positive point of view. He proved 
to me, by reminiscence and example, how different are 
actual and ideal conditions. And finally he wound up 
with a single question that opened a new world to me. 
“What,” he asked, “is the dominant characteristic of, 
the child’s mind?” I thought at first that I was on 
safe ground — for had I not taken a course in child 
study, and had I not measured some hundreds of school 
children while working out a university thesis? So I 
began with my list. But, at each characteristic that I 
mentioned he shook his head. ‘‘No,” he said, “no; 
that is not right.” And when finally I had exhausted 
my list, he said to me, “The dominant characteristic of 
the child’s mind is its seriousness. The child is the most 
Serious creature in the world.” 
The answer staggered me fora moment. Like ninety- 
nine per cent of the adult population of this globe, the 
seriousness of the child had never appealed to me. In 
spite of the theoretical basis of my training, that single, 
dominant element of child life had escaped me. I had 
gained my notion of the child from books, and, I also fear, 
from the Sunday supplements. To me, deep down in 
my heart, the child was an animated joke. I was im- 
mersed in unscientific preconceptions. But the master 
craftsman had gained his conception of child life from 
intimate, empirical acquaintance with the genus boy. 
He had gleaned from his experience that fundamental  
-P-A-G-E-136
  126 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
truth: “The child is the most serious creature in the 
world.” 
Sometime I hope that I may make some fitting ac- 
knowledgment of the debt of gratitude that I owe to 
that man. The opportunities that I had to talk with 
him were all too few, but I did make a memorable visit 
to his school, and studied at first hand the great work 
that he was doing for the pupils of the Columbia dis- 
trict. He died the next year, and I shall never forget 
the words that stood beneath his picture that night in 
one of the daily papers: “Charles Howard: Architect 
of Character.” 
I 
The essence of the scientific spirit is to view experi- 
ence without prejudice, and that was the lesson that I 
learned from the school system of St.Louis. 
The difference between the ideal child and the real 
child, — the difference between what fancy pictures a 
schoolroom to be and what actual first-hand acquaint- 
ance shows that it is, the difference between a precon- 
ceived notion and an actual stubborn fact of experience, 
—these were among the lessons that I learned in these 
schools. But, at the same time, there was no crass 
materialism accompanying this teaching. There was 
no loss of the broader point of view. A fact is a fact, 
and we cannot get around it, — and this is what scien- 
tific method has insisted upon from its inception. But 
always beyond the fact is its significance, its meaning.
-P-A-G-E-137
PO ae THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION 127 
That the St. Louis schools have for the last fifty years 
stood for the larger view; that they have never, so far 
as I know, exploited the new and the bizarre simply 
because it was new and strange, —this is due, I be- 
lieve, to the insight and inspiration of the man! who 
first fashioned the framework of this «System, and 
breathed into it as a system the vitalizing element of 
idealism. Personally, I have not always been in sym- 
pathy with the teachings of the Hegelian philosophy, — 
I have not always understood them,— but no man 
could witness the silent, steady, unchecked growth of 
the St. Louis schools without being firmly and indelibly 
impressed with dynamic value of a richly conceived and 
rigidly wrought system of fundamental principles. “The 
cause ‘of education has suffered much from the failure 
of educators to break loose from the shackles of the past. 
But it has, in some places, suffered still more from the 
tendency of the human mind to confuse fundamental 
principles with the shackles of tradition. The rage for 
the new and the untried, simply because it is new and 
untried, — this has been, and is to-day, the rock upon 
which real educational progress is most likely to be 
wrecked. This is a rock, I believe, that St. Louis has 
so far escaped, and I have no doubt that its escape has 
been due, in large measure, to the careful, rigid, laborious, 
and yet illuminating manner in which that great captain 
charted out its course.

Til 
Fundamentally, there is, I believe, no discrepancy, no 
inconsistency, between the scientific spirit in education 
and what may be called the philosophical spirit. As I 
have suggested, there are always two dangers that 
must be avoided: the danger, in the first place, of think- 
ing of the old as essentially bad; and, on the other 
hand, the danger of thinking of the new and strange 
and unknown as essentially bad; the danger of confus- 
ing a sound conservatism with a blind worship of estab- 
ished custom; and the danger of confusing a sound 
radicalism with the blind worship of the new and the 
bizarre. 
Let me give you an example of what I mean. There 
is a rather bitter controversy at present between two 
factions of science teachers. One faction insists that 
physics and chemistry and biology should be taught in 
the high school from the economic point of view, — that 
the economic applications of these sciences to great 
human arts, such as engineering and agriculture, should 
be emphasized at every point, — that a great deal of 
the material now taught in these sciences is both use- 
less and unattractive to the average high-school pupil. 
The other faction maintains that such a course would 
mean the destruction of science as an integral part of 
the secondary culture course, — that science to be cul- 
tural must be pure science, — must be viewed apart
-P-A-G-E-139
  
THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION 129 
from its economic applications, — apart from its rela- 
tions to the bread-and-butter problem. * 
Now many of the advocates of the first point of 
view — many of the people that would emphasize the 
economic side — are animated by the spirit of change 
and unrest which dominates our latter-day civilization. 
They wish to follow the popular demand. ‘Down with 
scholasticism !”” is their cry; ‘Down with this blind 
worship of custom and tradition! Let us do the thing 
that gives the greatest immediate benefit to our pupils. 
Let us discard the elements in our courses that are hard 
and dry and barren of practical results.” Now these 
men, I believe, are basing their argument upon the 
fallacy of immediate expediency. The old is bad, the 
new is good. That is their argument. They have no 
sheet anchor out to windward. They are willing to 
drift with the gale. 
Many of the advocates of the second point of view 
—many of the people who hold to the old line, pure- 
science teaching — are, on the other hand, animated by 
a spirit of irrational conservatism. ‘‘Down with radical- 
ism!” they shout ; ‘‘Down with the innovators! Things 
that are hard and dry are good mental discipline. They 
made our fathers strong. They can make our children 
strong. What was good enough for the great minds of 
the past is good enough for us.” 
Now these men, I believe, have gone to the other 
extreme. They have confused custom and tradition 
K
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
with fundamental and eternal principles. They have 
thought that, just because a thing is old, it is good, 
just as their antagonists have thought that just because 
a thing is new it is good. 
In both cases, obviously, the scientific spirit is lack- 
ing. The most fundamental of all principles is the 
principle of truth. And yet these men who are teachers 
of science are —both classes of them —ruled them- 
selves by dogma. And meantime the sciences are in 
danger of losing their place in secondary education. 
The rich promise that was held out a generation ago 
has not been fulfilled. Within the last decade, the en- 
rollment in the science courses has not increased in 
proportion to the total enrollment, while the enroll- 
ment in Latin (which fifteen years ago was about to be 
cast upon the educational scrap heap) has grown by 
leaps and bounds. 
Now this is a type of a great many controversies in 
education. We talk and theorize, but very seldom do 
we try to find out the actual facts in the case by any 
adequate tests. 
It was the lack of such tests that led us at the Uni- 
versity of Illinois to enter upon a series of impartial 
investigations to see whether we could not take some of 
these mooted questions out of the realm of eternal con- 
troversy, and provide some definite solutions. We 
chose among others this controversy between the eco- 
nomic scientists and the pure scientists. We took a high-
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION I3r 
school class and divided it into two sections. We tried 
to place in each section an equal number of bright and 
mediocre and dull pupils, so that the conditions would 
be equalized. Then we chose an excellent teacher, a 
man who could approach the problem with an open 
mind, without prejudice or favor. During the present 
year he has been teaching these parallel sections. In 
one section he has emphasized economic applications ; 
in the other he has taught the class upon the customary 
pure-science basis. He has kept a careful record of his 
work, and at stated intervals he has given both sections 
the same tests. We propose to carry on this investi- 
gation year after year with different classes, different 
teachers, and in different schools. We are not in a 
hurry to reach conclusions. 
Now I said that the safeguard in all work of this 
sort is to keep our grip firm and fast on the eternal 
truths. In this work that I mention we are not trying 
to prove that either pure science or applied science 
interests our pupils the more or helps them the more 
in meeting immediate economic situations. We do not 
propose to measure the success of either method by 
its effect upon the bread-winning power of the pupil. 
What we believe that science teaching should insure, is 
a grip on the scientific method and an illuminating in- 
sight into the forces of nature, and we are simply at- 
tempting to see whether the economic applications will 
make this grip firmer or weaker, and this insight clearer
-P-A-G-E-142
  132 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
or more obscure. I trust that this point is plain, for it 
illustrates what I have just said regarding the danger of 
following a popular demand. We need no experiment 
to prove that economic science is more useful in the 
narrow sense than is pure science. What we wish to 
determine is whether a judicious mixture of the two 
sorts of teaching will or will not enable us to realize 
this rich cultural value much more effectively than a 
traditional purely cultural course. 
Now that illustrates what I think is the real and 
important application of the scientific spirit to the solu- 
tion of educational problems. You will readily see that 
it does not do away necessarily with our ideals. It 
is not necessarily materialistic. It is not necessarily 
idealistic. Either side may utilize it. It is a quite 
impersonal factor. But it does promise to take some 
of our educational problems out of the field of useless 
and wasteful controversy, and it does promise to get 
men of conflicting views together, —for, in the case 
that I have just cited, if we prove that the right ad- 
mixture of methods may enable us to realize both a 
cultural and a utilitarian value, there is no reason why 
the culturists and the utilitarians should not get together, 
cease their quarreling, take off their coats, and go to 
work. Few people will deny that bread and butter is a 
rather essential thing in this life of ours; very few will 
deny that material prosperity in temperate amounts is 
good for all of us; and very few also will deny that far
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION 133 
more fundamental than bread and butter — far more 
important than material prosperity—are the great 
fundamental and eternal truths which man has wrought 
out of his experience and which are most effectively 
crystallized in the creations of pure art, the master- 
pieces of pure literature, and the discoveries of pure 
science. 
Certainly if we of the twentieth century can agree 
upon any one thing, it is this: That life without toil is 
a crime, and that any one who enjoys leisure and com- 
fort and the luxuries of living without paying the price 
of toil is a social parasite. I believe that it is an im- 
portant function of public education to impress upon 
each generation the highest ideals of living as well as 
the arts that are essential to the making of a livelihood, 
but I wish to protest against the doctrine that these 
two factors stand over against one another as the posi- 
tive and negative poles of human existence. In other 
words, I protest against the notion, that the study of 
the practical everyday problems of human life is without 
what we are pleased to call a culture value, —that in 
the proper study of those problems one is not able to 
see the operation of fundamental and eternal principles. 
I shall readily agree that there is always a grave 
danger that the trivial and temporary objects of every- 
day life may be viewed and studied without reference 
to these fundamental principles. But this danger is 
certainly no greater than that the permanent and eter- _
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
nal truths be studied without reference to the actual, 
concrete, workaday world in which we live. I have 
seen exercises in manual training that had for their 
purpose the perfection of the pupil in some little art 
of joinery for which he would, in all probability, have 
not the slightest use in his later life. But even if he 
should find use for it, the process was not being taught 
in the proper way. He was being made conscious 
only of the little trivial thing, and no part of his in- 
struction was directed toward the much more important, 
fundamental lesson, — the lesson, namely, that ‘‘a little 
thing may be perfect, but that perfection itself is not a 
little thing.” 
I say that I have witnessed such an exercise in the 
very practical field of manual training. I may add 
that I went through several such exercises myself, and 
emerged with a disgust that always recurs to me when 
I am told that every boy will respond to the stimulus 
of the hammer and the jack plane. But I should hasten 
to add that I have also seen what we call the humani- 
ties so taught that the pupil has emerged from them 
with a supreme contempt for the life of labor and a 
feeling of disgust at the petty and trivial problems of 
human life which every one must face. I have seen 
art and literature so taught as to leave their students 
not with the high purpose to mold their lives in ac- 
cordance with the high ideals that art and literature 
represent, not the firm resolution to do what they
-P-A-G-E-145
THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION 135 
could to relieve the ugliness of the world where 
they found it ugly, or to do what they could to 
ennoble life when they found it vile; but rather 
with an attitude of calm superiority, as if they were 
in some way privileged to the delights of esthetic 
enjoyment, leaving the baser born to do the world’s 
drudgery. 
I have seen the principles of agriculture so taught as 
to leave with the student the impression that he could 
raise more corn than his neighbor and sell it at a higher 
price if he mastered the principles of nitrification; and 
all without one single reference to the basic principle of 
conservation upon which the welfare of the human , 
race for all time to come must inevitably depend, — 
without a single reference to the moral iniquity of 
waste and sloth and ignorance. But I have also seen 
men who have mastered the scientific method, — the 
method of controlled observation, and unprejudiced 
induction and inference, — in the laboratories of pure 
science; and who have gained so overweening and 
hypertrophied a regard for this method that they have 
considered it too holy to be contaminated by applica- 
tion to practical problems, — who have sneered con- 
temptuously when some adventurer has proposed, for 
example, to subject the teaching of science itself to the 
searchlight of scientific method. 
I trust that these examples have made my point 
clear, for it is certainly simple enough. If vocational 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
education means simply that the arts and skills of in- 
dustrial life are to be transmitted safely from genera- 
tion to generation, a minimum of educational machinery 
is all that is necessary, and we do not need to worry 
much about it. If vocational education means simply 
this, it need not trouble us much; for economic condi- 
tions will sooner or later provide for an effective means 
of transmission, just as economic conditions will sooner 
or later perfect, through a blind and empirical process 
of elimination, the most’ effective methods of agricul- 
ture, as in the case of China and other overpopulated 
nations of the Orient. 
But I take it that we mean by vocational education 
something more than this, just as we mean by cultural 
education something more than a veneer of language, 
history, pure science, and the fine arts. In the former 
case, the practical problems of life are to be lifted to 
the plane of fundamental principles; in the latter case, 
fundamental principles are to be brought down to the 
plane of present, everyday life. I can see no dis- 
crepancy here. To my mind there is no cultural sub- 
ject that has not its practical outcome, and there is no 
practical subject that has not its humanizing influence 
if only we go to some pains to seek it out. I do not 
object to a subject of instruction that promises to put 
dollars into the pockets of those that study it. I do 
object to the mode of teaching that subject which fails 
to use this effective economic appeal in stimulating a  
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION 137 
glimpse of the broader vision. I do not object to the 
subject that appeals to the pupil’s curiosity because it 
informs him of the wonderful deeds that men have done 
in the past. I do object to that mode of teaching this 
subject which simply arouses interest in a spectacular 
deed, and then fails to use this interest in the inter- 
pretation of present problems. I do not contend that 
in either case there must be an explicit pointing of 
morals and drawing of lessons. But I do contend that 
the teacher who is in charge of the process should 
always have this purpose in the forefront of his con- 
sciousness, and — now by direct comparison, now by 
indirection and suggestion — guide his pupils to the 
goal desired. 
I hope that through careful tests, we shall some day 
be able to demonstrate that there is much that is good 
and valuable on both sides of every controverted educa- 
tional question. After all, in this complex and intricate 
task of teaching to which you and I are devoting our 
lives, there is too much at stake to permit us for a 
moment to be dogmatic, — to permit us for a moment 
to hold ourselves in any other attitude save one of 
openness and reception to the truth when the truth 
shall have been demonstrated. Neither your ideas nor 
mine, nor those of any man or group of men, living or 
dead, are important enough to stand in the way of the 
best possible accomplishment of that great task to which 
we have set our hands.

But I did not propose this morning to talk to you 
about science as a part of our educational curriculum, 
but rather about the scientific spirit and the scientific 
method as effective instruments for the solution of our 
own peculiar educational problems. I have tried to 
give you reasons for believing that an adoption of this 
policy does not necessarily commit us to materialism 
or to a narrowly economic point of view. I have at- 
tempted to show that the scientific method may be 
applied to the solution of our problems while we still 
retain our faith in ideals; and that, unless we do retain 
that faith, our investigations will be without point or 
meaning. 
This problem of vocational education to which I 
have just referred is one that is likely to remain un- 
solved until we have made a searching investigation 
of its factors in the light of scientific method. Some 
people profess not to be worried by the difficulty of 
finding time in our elementary and secondary schools 
for the introduction of the newer subjects making for 
increased vocational efficiency. They would cut the 
Gordian knot with one single operation by eliminating 
enough of the older subjects to make room for the 
new. I confess that this solution does not appeal to 
me. Fundamentally the core of the elementary cur- 
riculum must, I believe, always be the arts that are
-P-A-G-E-149
THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION 139 
essential to every one who lives the social life. In other 
words, the language arts and the number arts are, and 
always must be, the fundamentals of elementary edu- 
cation. I do not believe that specialized vocational 
education should ever be introduced at the expense of 
thorough training in the subjects that already hold 
their place in the curriculum. And yet we are con- 
fronted by the economic necessity of solving in some 
way this vocational problem. How are we to do it? 
It is here that the scientific method may perhaps 
come to our aid. The obvious avenue of attack upon 
this problem is to determine whether we cannot save 
time and energy, not by the drastic operation of elimi- 
nating old subjects, but rather by improving our 
technique of teaching, so that the waste may be re- 
duced, and the time thus saved given to these new 
subjects that are so vociferously demanding admission. 
In Cleveland, for example, the method of teaching 
spelling has been subjected to a rigid scientific treat- 
ment, and, as a result, spelling is being taught to-day 
vastly better than ever before and with a much smaller 
expenditure of time and energy. It has been due, very 
largely, to the application of a few well-known prin- 
ciples which the science of psychology has furnished. 
Now that is vastly better than saying that spelling is 
a subject that takes too much time in our schools and 
consequently ought forthwith to be eliminated. In 
all of our school work enough time is undoubtedly

wasted to provide ample opportunity for training the 
child thoroughly in some vocation if we wish to vocation- 
alize him, and I do not think that this would hurt 
him, even if he does not follow the vocation in later life. 
To-day we are attempting to detect these sources of 
waste in technique. The problems of habit building or 
memorizing are already well on the way to solution. 
Careful tests have shown the value of doing memory 
work in a certain definite way —learning by unit 
wholes rather than by fragments, for example. Experi- 
ments have been conducted to determine the best 
length of time to give to drill processes, such as spelling, 
and penmanship, and the fundamental tables of arith- 
metic. It is already clearly demonstrated that brief 
periods of intense concentration are more economical 
than longer periods during which the monotony of 
repetition fags the mind to a point where it can no 
longer work effectively. We are also beginning to see 
from these tests, that a systematic method of attacking 
such a problem as the memorizing of the tables will do 
much to save time and promote efficiency. We are 
finding that it is extremely profitable to instruct chil- 
dreh in the technique of learning, — to start them out 
in the right way by careful example, so that much of 
the time and energy that was formerly dissipated, may 
now be conserved. 
And there is a suggestion, also, that in the average 
school, the vast possibilities of the child’s latent energy 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION I41 
are only imperfectly realized. A friend of mine stumbled 
accidentally upon this fact by introducing a new method 
of grading. He divided his pupils into three groups 
or streams. The group that progressed the fastest was 
made up of those who averaged 85 per cent and over 
in their work. A middle group averaged between 75 
per cent and 85 per cent in their work, and a third, 
slow group was made up of those who averaged below 
75 per cent. At the end of the first month, he found 
that a certain proportion of his pupils, who had formerly 
hovered around the passing grade of 70, began to forge 
ahead. Many of them easily went into the fastest 
stream, but they were still satisfied with the minimum 
standing for that group. In other words, whether we 
like to admit it or not, most men and women and boys 
and girls are content with the passing grades, both in 
school and in life. So common is the phenomenon that 
we think of the matter fatalistically. But supply a 
stimulus, raise the standard, and you will find some of 
these individuals forging up to the next level. 
Professor James’s doctrine of latent energies bids fair 
to furnish the solution of a vast number of perplexing 
educational problems. Certain it is that our pupils. of 
to-day are not overburdened with work. They are 
sometimes irritated by too many tasks, sometimes 
dulled by dead routine, sometimes exhilarated to the 
point of mental ennui by spectacular appeals to im- 
mediate interest. But they are seldom overworked, or

even worked to within a healthful degree of the fatigue 
point. 
Elementary education has often been accused of 
transacting its business in small coin, — of dealing with 
and emphasizing trivialities, — and yet every time that 
the scientific method touches the field of education, it 
reveals the fundamental significance of little things. 
Whether the third-grade pupil should memorize the 
multiplication tables in the form, ‘‘8 times 9 equals 72” 
or simply “‘8-9’s — 72” seems a matter of insignificance 
in contrast with the larger problems that beset us. 
And yet scientific investigation tells us clearly and 
unequivocally that any useless addition to a formula 
to be memorized increases the time for reducing the 
formula to memory, and interferes significantly with its 
recall and application. It may seem a matter of trivial 
importance whether the pupil increases the subtrahend 
number or decreases the minuend number when he 
subtracts digits that involve taking or borrowing; and 
yet investigation proves that to increase the subtrahend 
number is by far the simpler process, and eliminates 
both a source of waste and a source of error, which, in 
the aggregate, may assume a significance to mental 
economy that is well worth considering. 
In fact, if we are ever to solve the broader, bigger, more 
attractive problems, —like the problem of vocational 
education, or the problem of retardation, — we must 
first find a solution for some of the smaller and seemingly

THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IN EDUCATION 143 
trivial questions of the very existence of which the lay 
public may be quite unaware, but which you and I know 
to mean an untold total of waste and inefficiency in the 
work that we are trying to do. 
And one reason why the scientific attitude toward edu- 
cational problems appeals to me is simply because this 
attitude carries with it a respect for these seemingly 
trivial and commonplace problems; for just as the 
greatest triumph of the teaching art is to get our pupils to 
see in those things of life that are fleeting and transitory 
the operation of fundamental and eternal principles, so the 
glory of the scientific method lies in its power to reveal the 
significance of the commonplace and to teach us that no 
slightest detail of our daily work is necessarily devoid of 
inspiration; that every slightest detail of school method 
and school management has a meaning and a significance 
that it is worth our while to ponder.

In its widest aspects, the problem of teaching pupils 
how to study forms a large part of the larger educational 
problem. It means, not only teaching them how to read 
books, and to make the content of books part of their own 
mental capital, but also, and perhaps far more signifi- 
cantly, teaching them how to draw lessons from their own 
experiences; not only how to observe and classify and 
draw conclusions, but also how to evaluate their ex- 
perience — how to judge whether certain things that they 
do give adequate or inadequate results. 
“In the narrower sense, hewever, the art of study may be 
said to consist in the ability to assimilate the experiences 
of others, and it is in this narrower sense that I shall dis- 
cuss the problem to-day. It is not only in books that 
human experience is recorded, and yet it is true that the 
reading of books is the most economical means of gaining 
these experiences; consequently, we may still further

narrow our problem to this: How may pupils be trained 
effectively to glean, through the medium of the printed 
page, the great lessons of race experience ? 
The word ‘‘study” is thus used in the sense in which 
most teachers employ it. When we speak of a pupil’s 
studying his lessons, we commonly mean that he is bend- 
ing over a text-book, attempting to assimilate the contents 
of the text. Just what it means to study, even in this 
narrow sense of the term, — just what it means, psycho- 
logically, to assimilate even the simplest thoughts of 
others, —I cannot tell you, and I do not know of any one 
who can answer this seemingly simple question satisfac- 
torily. We all study, but what happens in our minds 
when we do study is a mystery. We all do some think- 
ing, and yet the psychology of thinking is the great un- 
discovered and unexplored region in the field of mental 
science. Until we know something of the psychology of 
thinking, we can hope for very little definite information 
concerning the psychology of study, for study is so in- 
timately bound up with thinking that the two are not 
to be separated. 
But even if it is impossible at the present time to ana- 
lyze the process of studying, we are pretty well agreed as 
to what constitutes successful study, and many rules have 
been formulated for helping pupils to acquire effective 
habits of study. These rules concern us only indirectly 
at the present time, for our problem is still narrower in its 
scope. It has to do with the possibility of so training 
L

  146 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
children in the art of study, not only that they may study 
effectively in school, but also that they may carry over the 
habits and methods of study thus acquired into the tasks 
of later life. In other words, the topic that we are dis- 
cussing is but one phase of the problem of formal disci- 
pline, — the problem of securing a transfer of training 
from a specific field to other fields ; and my purpose is to 
view this topic of “study” in the light of what we know 
concerning the possibilities of transfer. 
Let me take a specific example. I am not so much con- 
cerned with the problem of getting a pupil to master a 
history lesson quickly and effectively, — not how he may 
best assimilate the facts concerning the Missouri Com- 
promise, for example. My task is rather to determine 
how we can make his mastery of the Missouri Compro- 
mise a lesson in the general art of study, — how that 
mastery may help him develop what we used to call the 
general power of study, — the capacity to apply an effec- 
tive method of study to other problems, perhaps, very 
far removed from the history lesson; in other words, 
how that single lesson may help him in the more general 
task of finding any type of information when he needs it, 
of assimilating it once he has found it, and of applying it 
once he has assimilated it. ( 
In an audience of practical teachers, it is hardly neces- 
sary to emphasize the significance of doing this very thing. 
From one point of view, it may be asserted that the whole 
future of what we term general education, as distinguished
-P-A-G-E-157
  TRAINING CHILDREN HOW TO STUDY 147 
from technical or vocational education, depends upon our 
ability to solve problems like this, and solve them satisfac- 
torily. We can never justify universal general education 
beyond the merest rudiments unless we can demon- 
strate acceptably that the training which general educa- 
tion furnishes will help the individual to solve the every- 
day problems of his life. Either we must train the pupil 
in a general way so that he will be able to acquire special- 
ized skill more quickly and more effectively than will the 
pupil who lacks this general training; or we must give 
up a large part of the general-culture courses that now 
occupy an important part in our elementary and secon- 
dary curriculums, and replace these with technical and 
vocational subjects that shall have for their purpose the 
development of specialized efficiency. 
All teachers, I take it, are alive to the grave dangers 
of the latter policy. Whether we have thought the 
matter through logically or not we certainly feel strongly 
that too early specialization will work a serious injury to 
the cause of education, and, through education, to the 
larger cause of social advancement and enlightenment. 
We view with grave foreboding any policy that will shut 
the door of opportunity to any child, no matter how 
humble or how unpromising. And yet we also know that, 
unless the general education that we now offer can be dis- 
tinctly shown to have a beneficial influence upon special- 
ized efficiency, we shall be forced by economic conditions 
into this very policy. It is small wonder, then, that so
-P-A-G-E-158
    
148 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
many of our educational discussions and investigations 
to-day turn upon this problem; and among the various 
phases of the problem none is more significant than that 
which is covered by our topic of to-day, — How may we 
develop in the pupil a general power or capacity for gain- 
ing information independently of schools and teachers? 
If we could adequately develop this power, there is much 
in the way of specialized instruction that could be safely 
left to the individual himself. If we could teach him 
how to study, then we could perhaps trust him to master 
some of the principles of any calling that he undertakes 
in so far as these principles can be mastered from books. 
To teach the child to study effectively is to do the most 
useful thing that could be done to help him to adjust 
himself to any environment of modern civilized life into 
which he may be thrown. For there is one thing that 
the more radical advocates of a narrow vocational edu- 
cation commonly forget, and that is the constant change 
that is going on in industrial processes. When we limit 
our vocational teaching to a mere mastery of technique, 
there is no guarantee that the process which we teach 
to-day may not be discarded in five or ten years from 
to-day. Even the narrower technical principles which 
are so extremely important to-day may be relatively 
insignificant by the time that the child whom we are 
training takes his place in the industrial world. But if 
we can arm the individual with the more fundamental 
principles which are fixed for all time; and if, in addi-
-P-A-G-E-159
  
TRAINING CHILDREN HOW TO STUDY 149 
tion to this, we can teach him how to master the 
specialized principles which may come into the field un- 
heralded and unexpected, and turn topsy-turvy the older 
methods of doing his work, then we shall have done 
much toward helping him in solving that perplexing 
problem of gaining a livelihood. 
I 
I shall not try in this discussion of the problem of study 
to summarize completely the principles and precepts that 
have been presented so well in the four books on the 
subject that have appeared in the last two years. I do 
not know, in fact, of any book that is more useful to the 
teacher just at present than Professor Frank McMurry’s 
How to Study and Teaching how to Study. It is a book 
that is both a help and a delight, for it is clear and well- 
organized; and written in a vivacious style and with a 
wealth of concrete illustration that holds the attention 
from beginning to end. The chief fault that I have to find 
with it is the fault that I have to find with almost every 
educational book that comes from the press to-day, — 
the tendency, namely, to imply that the teacher of to-day 
is doing very little to solve these troublesome problems. 
As a matter of fact, many teachers are securing excellent 
results from their attempts to teach pupils how to study. 
Otherwise we should not find so many energetic young 
men to-day who are making an effective individual mas- 
tery of the principles of their respective trades and pro-  
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
fessions independently of schools and teachers. Our atti- 
tude toward these questions, far from being that of the 
pessimist, should be that of the optimist. Our task 
should be to seek out these successful teachers, and find 
out how they do their work. 
Among the most important points emphasized by the 
recent writers upon the art of study is the necessity for 
some form of motivation in the work of mastering the 
text. We all know that if a pupil feels a distinct need for 
getting information out of a book, the chances are that he 
will get it if the book is available and if he can read.. To 
create a problem that will involve in its solution the 
gaining of such information is, therefore, one of the best 
approaches to a mastery of the art of study. | It is, how- 
ever, only the beginning. It furnishes the necessary 
energy, but does not map out the path along which this 
energy is to be expended. And this is where the greater 
emphasis, perhaps, is needed. 
One of the best teachers that I ever knew taught the 
subject that we now call agronomy, — a branch of agri- 
cultural science that has to do with field crops. Iwasa 
mere boy when I sat under his instruction, but certain 
points in his method of teaching made a most distinct 
_ impression upon me. Lectures we had, of course, for 
‘lecturing was the orthodox method of class instruction. 
But this man did something more than merely lecture. 
He assigned each one of his students a plat of ground on 
the college farm. Upon this plat of ground, a definite 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
TRAINING CHILDREN HOW TO STUDY Ist 
experiment was to be conducted. One of my experiments 
had to do with the smut of oats. I was to try the effect of 
treating the seed with hot water in order to see whether it 
would prevent the fungus from later destroying the ripen- 
ing grain. The very nature of the problem interested 
me intensely. I began to wonder about the life-history 
of this fungus, — how it looked and how it germinated 
and how it grew and wrought its destructive influence. 
It was not long before I found myself spending some of 
my leisure moments in the library trying to find out 
what was known concerning this subject. I was not so 
successful as I might have been, but I am confident that 
I learned more about parasitic fungi under the spur of 
that curiosity than I should have done in five times the 
number of hours spent in formal, meaningless study. 
But the point of my experience is not that a problem 
interest had been awakened, but rather that the white 
heat of that interest was not utilized so completely as it 
might have been utilized in fixing upon my mind some im- 
portant details in the general method of running down 
references and acquiring information. That was the 
moment to strike, and one serious defect of our school or- 
ganization to-day is that most teachers, like my teacher 
at that time, have so much to do that anything like indge 2    
   
vidual attention at such moments is out of the question.” 
Next to individual attention, probably, the best way to 
overcome the difficulty is to give class instruction in these 
matters, —to set aside a definite period for teaching
-P-A-G-E-162
152 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
~pupils the technique of using books:—If one could arouse 
_a sufficiently general problem interest, this sort of in- 
struction could be made most effective. But even if the 
problem interest is not general, I think that it is well to 
assume that it exists in some pupils, at least, and to give 
them the benefit of class instruction in the art of study, 
— even if some of the seed should fall upon barren soil. 
This aspect of teaching pupils how to study is particu- 
larly important in the upper grades and the high school, 
where pupils have sufficiently mastered the technique of   
    
reading to be intrusted with individual problems, and 
where some reference books are commonly available. 
  Chief among these always is the dictionary, and to get 
pupils to use this ponderous volume effectively is one of 
the important steps in teaching them how to study. 
Here, too, it is easy to be pedantic. As I shall insist 
strenuously a little later, the chief factor in insuring a 
transfer of training from one subject to another is to 
leave in the pupil’s mind a distinct consciousness that 
the method that he has been trained to follow is worth 
while, — that it gets results. The dictionary habit is 
likely to begin and end within the schoolroom unless 
steps are taken to insure the operation of this factor. 
It is easy to overwork the dictionary and to use it 
fruitlessly, in so great a measure, in fact, that the pupil 
will never want to see a dictionary again. 
Aside from the use of the dictionary, is the use of the 
helps that modern books provide for finding the informa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
TRAINING CHILDREN HOW TO STUDY 153 
tion that may be desired, — indices, tables of contents, 
marginal and cross-references, and the like. These, again, 
are most significant in the work of the upper grades and 
the high school, and here again if we wish the skill that is 
developed in their use to be transferred, we must take 
pains to see that the pupil really appreciates their value, 
— that he realizes their time-saving and energy-saving 
functions. I do not know that there is any better way to 
do this than to let him flounder around without them for 
a little so that his sense of their value may be enhanced 
by contrast. 
Tit 
Another important step emphasized by the recent 
writers is the need for training children to pick out the 
significant features in the text or portion of the text that 
they are reading. This, of course, is work that is to be 
undertaken from the very moment that they begin to use 
books. How to do it effectively is a puzzling problem 
and one that will amply repay study and experimentation 
by the individual teacher. Much studying of lessons by 
teachers and pupils together will help, provided that the 
exercise is spirited and vital, and is not looked upon by the 
pupils as an easy way of getting out of recitation work. 
McMurry strongly recommends the marking of books to 
indicate the topic sentences and the other salient features. 
Personally, I am sure from my own experience that the 
assignment is all-important here, and that study ques- 
tions and problems which can be answered or solved by 
   
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
reference to the text will help matters very much; but 
care must, of course, be taken that the continued use 
of such questions does not preclude the pupil’s own 
mastery of the art of study. To eliminate this danger, it 
is well that the pupils be requested frequently to make 
out their own lists of questions, and, as speedily as pos- 
sible, both the questions made by the pupil and those 
made by the teacher, should be replaced by topical 
outlines. By taking care that the questions are logically 
arranged, — that is, that a general question refer to the 
topic of the paragraph, and other subordinate questions to 
the subordinate details of the paragraph, — the transition 
from the questions to the topical outline may be readily 
made. Simultaneously with this will go the transition 
in recitation from the question-and-answer type to the 
topical type; and when you have trained a class into the 
habit of topical recitation, — when each pupil can talk 
right through a topic (not around it or underneath it or 
above it) without the use of “pumping” questions by the 
teacher, — you have gone a long way toward developing 
the art of study. 
The transfer of this training, however, is quite another 
matter. There are pupils who can work up excellent 
topical recitations from their school text-books but who 
are utterly at sea in getting a grasp on a subject treated 
in other books. Here again the problem lies in getting 
the pupil to see the method apart from its content, and 
to show him that it really brings results that are worth  
-P-A-G-E-165
  TRAINING CHILDREN HOW TO STUDY 55 
while. If, in our training in the topical method, we are 
too formal and didactic, the art of study will begin and 
end right there. It is here that the factor of motiva- 
tion is of supreme importance. When real problems are 
raised which require for their solution intelligent reading, 
the general worth of the method of study can be clearly 
shown. I do not go so far as to say that the pupil should 
never be required to study unless he has a real problem 
that he wishes to solve. In fact, I think that we still 
have a large place for the formal, systematic mastery of 
texts by every pupil in our schools. I do contend, how- 
ever, that the frequent introduction of real problems 
will give us an opportunity to show the pupil that the 
method that he has utilized in his more formal school 
work is adequate and essential to do the thing that appeals 
to him as worth while. Only in this way, I believe, can 
we insure that transfer of training which is the impor- 
tant factor from our present standpoint. 
And I ought also to say, parenthetically, that we should 
“motivation.” not interpret too narrowly this word 
Let us remember that what may appeal to the adult as 
an effective motive does not always appeal to the child 
as such. Economic motives are the most effective, prob- 
ably, in our own adult lives, and probably very effective 
with high-school pupils, but economic motives are not 
always strong in young children, nor should we wish them 
tobe. It is not always true that the child will approach a 
school task sympathetically when he knows that the task
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
is an essential preparation for the life that is going on 
about him. He may work harder at a task in order to get 
ahead of his fellow-pupils than he would if the motive 
were to fit him to enter a shop or a factory. Motive is 
largely a matter of instinct with the child, and he may, 
indeed, be perfectly satisfied with a school task just as it 
stands. For example, we all know that children enjoy 
the right kind of drill. Repetition, especially rhythmic 
repetition, is instinctive, —it satisfies an inborn need. 
Where such a condition exists, it is an obvious waste of 
time to search about for more indirect motives. The 
economical thing to do is to turn the ready energy of the 
child into the channel that is already open to it, so long as 
this procedure fits in with the results that we must secure. 
I feel like emphasizing this fact, inasmuch as the terms 
“problem interest” and ‘‘motivation” seem most com- 
monly to be associated in the minds of teachers with what 
we adults term “real” or economic situations. To learn 
a lesson well may often be a sufficient motive, — may 
often constitute a ‘‘real” situation to the child, — and if 
it does, it will serve very effectively our purposes in this 
other task, — namely, getting the pupil to see the worth 
of the method that we ask him to employ. 
IV 
There are one or two points of a general nature in 
connection with the art of study that should be empha- 
sized. In the first place, the upper-grade and high-school
-P-A-G-E-167
  TRAINING CHILDREN HOW TO STUDY 157 
pupils are, I believe, mature enough to appreciate in some 
degree what knowledge really means. One of the falla- 
cies of which I was possessed on completing my work in 
the lower schools was the belief that there are some 
men who know everything. I naturally concluded that 
the superintendent of schools was one of these men; 
the family physician was another; the leading man in 
my town was a third ; and any one who ever wrote a book 
was put, ex officio so to speak, into this class without fur- 
ther inquiry. One of the most astounding revelations 
of my later education was to learn that, after all, the 
_ amount of real knowledge in this world, voluminous 
though it seems, is after all pitiably small. Of opinion 
and speculation we have a surplus, but of real, downright, 
hard fact, our capital is still most insignificant. And I 
wonder if something could not be done in the high school 
to teach pupils the difference between fact and opinion, 
and something also of the slow, laborious process through 
which real facts are accumulated. How many mistakes 
of life are due to the lack of the judicial attitude right 
here. What mistakes we all make when we try to 
evaluate writings outside of our own special field of 
knowledge or activity. Nothing depresses me to-day 
quite so much as the readiness with which laymen mis- 
take opinion for fact in the field of psychology and edu- 
cation, — and I suppose that my own hasty acceptance 
of statements in other fields would have a similar effect 
upon the specialists of those fields.
-P-A-G-E-168
158 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
‘Can general education help us out at all in this matter ? 
I have only. one or two suggestions to make, and even 
these may not be worth a great deal. In the recent 
Polar controversy, the sympathies of the general public 
were, I think, at the outset with Cook. This was per- 
haps, natural, and yet the trained mind ought to have 
withheld judgment for one reason if for no other, — and 
that one reason was Peary’s long Arctic service, his un- 
questioned mastery of the technique of polar travel, 
his general reputation for honesty and caution in advanc- 
ing opinions. By all the lessons that history teaches, 
Peary’s word should have had precedence over Cook’s, for 
Peary was a specialist, while Cook was only an amateur. 
And yet the general public discounted entirely those 
lessons, and trusted rather the novice, with what results 
it is now unnecessary to review, — and in nine cases out 
of ten, the results will be the same. 
Could we not, as part of our work in training pupils to 
study, also teach them to give some sort of an evaluation 
to the authorities that they consult? Could we not 
teach them that, in nine cases out of ten, at least, the man 
who has the message most worth listening to is the man 
who has worked the hardest and the longest in his field, 
and who enjoys the best reputation among his fellow- 
workers? Sometimes, I admit, the rule does not work, 
and especially with men whose reputations as authorities 
have outlived their period of productivity, but even this 
mistake could be guarded against. Certainly high-
-P-A-G-E-169
TRAINING CHILDREN HOW TO STUDY 159 
school pupils ought distinctly to understand that the 
authors of their text-books are not always the most 
learned men or the greatest authorities in the fields that 
they treat. The use of biographical dictionaries, of the 
books that are appearing in various fields giving brief 
biographies and often some authoritative estimate of the 
workers in these fields, is important in this connection. 
McMurry recommends that pupils be encouraged to 
take a critical attitude toward the principles they are set 
to master, — to judge, as he says, the soundness and 
worth of the statements that they learn. This is certainly 
good advice, and wherever the pupil can intelligently 
deal with real sources, it is well frequently to have him 
check up the statements of secondary sources. But, 
after all, this is the age of the specialist, and to trust one’s 
untrained judgment in a field remote from one’s knowl- 
edge and experience is likely to lead to unfortunate re- 
sults. We have all sorts of illustrations from the igno- 
rant man who will not trust the physician or the health 
official in matters of sanitation; because he lacks the 
proper perspective, he jumps to the conclusion that the 
specialist is a fraud. Would it not be well to supplement 
McMurry’s suggestion by the one that I have just made, 
— that is, that we train pupils how to evaluate authori-

And I believe that there is a place, also, in the high 
school, especially in connection with the work in science 
and history, for giving pupils some idea of how knowledge 
is really gained. I should not teach science exclusively 
by the laboratory method, nor history exclusively by the 
source method, but I should certainly take frequent op- 
portunity to let pupils work through some simple prob- 
lems from the beginnings, struggling with the conditions 
somewhat as the discoverers themselves struggled; fol- 
lowing up “blind leads” and toilsomely returning for a 
fresh start; meeting with discouragement; and finally 
feeling, perhaps, some of the joy that comes with success 
after struggle ; and all in order that they may know better 
and appreciate more fully the cost and the worth of that 
intellectual heritage which the master-minds of the world 
have bequeathed to the present and the future. And 
along with this, as they master the principles of science, 
let them learn also the human side of science, — the story 
of Newton, withholding his great discovery for years 
until he could be absolutely certain that it was a law; 
until he could get the very commonplace but obstreper- 
ous moon into harmony with his law of falling bodies ; — 
the story of Darwin, with his twenty-odd years of the 
most patient and persistent kind of toil; delving into 
the most unpromising materials, reading the driest 
books, always on the lookout for the facts that would 
point the way to the explanation of species ;— the 
story of Morse and his bitter struggle against poverty,
-P-A-G-E-171

and sickness, and innumerable disappointments up 
to the time when, in advancing years, success crowned 
his efforts. 
All this may seem very remote from the prosaic task of 
teaching pupils how to study; and yet it will lend its in- 
fluence toward the attainment of that end. For, after 
all, we must lead our pupils to see that some books, in 
spite of their formidable difficulties and their apparent 
abstractions, are still close to life, and that the truth which 
lies in books, and which we wish them to assimilate, has 
been wrought out of human experience, and not brought 
down miraculously from some remote storehouse of wis- 
dom that is accessible only to the elect. We poke a good 
deal of fun at book learning nowadays, and there is a 
pedantic type of book learning that certainly deserves all 
the ridicule that can be heaped upon it. But it is not 
wise to carry satire and ridicule too far in any direction, 
and especially when it may mean creating in young minds 
a distrust of the force that, more than any other single 
factor, has operated to raise man above the savage. 
Vv 
To teach the child the art of study means, then, that 
we take every possible occasion to impress upon his 
mind the value of study as a means of solving real and 
vital problems, and that, with this as an incentive, we 
gradually and persistently and systematically lead him 
to grasp the method of study as a method, — that is, 
M 
   
-P-A-G-E-172
  162 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
slowly and gradually to abstract the method from the 
particular cases to which he applies it and to emotion- 
alize it, — to make it an ideal. Only in this way, so 
far as we may know, can the art be so generalized as 
to find ready application in his later life. To this end, 
it is essential that the steps be taken repeatedly, — not 
begun to-day and never thought of again until next 
year, — but daily, even hourly, insuring a little growth. 
This means, too, not only that the teacher must pos- 
sess a high degree of patience, — that first principle of 
pedagogic skill, — but also that he have a comprehen- 
sive grasp of the problem, and the ability to separate 
the woods from the trees, so that, to him at least, the 
chief aim will never be lost to view. 
But, even at its best, the task is a severe one, and 
we need, here as elsewhere in education, carefully con- 
trolled tests and experiments, that will enable us to get 
at the facts. Above all, let me protest against the in- 
cidental theory of teaching pupils how to study. To 
adopt the incidental policy in any field of education, — 
whether in arithmetic, or spelling, or reading; whether 
in developing the power of reasoning or the memory, 
or the art of study, —is to throw wide open the doors 
that lead to the lines of least resistance, to lax methods, 
to easy honors, to weakened mental fiber, and to scamped 
work. Just as the pernicious doctrine of the subcon- 
scious is the first and last refuge of the psycho-faker, 
so incidental learning is the first and last refuge of soft
-P-A-G-E-173
  
TRAINING CHILDREN HOW TO STUDY 163 ty 
pedagogy. And I mean by incidental learning, going 
at a teaching task in an indolent, unreflective, hit-or- 
miss fashion in the hope that somehow or other from 
this process will emerge the very definite results that 
we desire.

A Pies For THE DEFINITE IN Epucation! 
I 
ONE way to be definite in education is to formulate 
as clearly as we can the aims that we hope to realize in 
every stage of our work. The task of teaching is so 
complex that, unless we strive earnestly and persistently 
to reduce it to the simplest possible terms, we are bound 
to work blindly and ineffectively. 
It is only one phase of this topic that I wish to dis- 
cuss with you this morning. My plea for the definite 
in education will be limited not only to the field of edu- 
cational aims and values, but to a small corner of that 
field. Your morning’s program has dealt with the 
problem of teaching history in the elementary school. 
I should like, if you are willing, to confine my remarks 
to this topic, and to attack the specific question, What 
is the history that we teach in the grades to do for the 
pupil? I wish to make this limitation, not only because 
what I have to say will be related to the other topics 
on the program, but also because this very subject of

A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 165 
history is one which the lack of a definite standard of 
educational value has been keenly felt. 
I should admit at the outset that my interest in his- 
tory is purely educational. I have had no special 
training in historical research. As you may perhaps 
infer from my discussion, my acquaintance with his- 
torical facts is very far from comprehensive. I speak 
as a layman in history, — and I do it openly and, per- 
haps, a little defiantly, for I believe that the last person 
to pass adequate judgment upon the general educational 
value of a given department of knowledge is a man 
who has made the department a life study. I have 
little faith in what the mathematician has to say regard- 
ing the educational value of mathematics for the average 
elementary pupil, because he is a special pleader and his 
conclusions cannot escape the coloring of his prejudice. 
I once knew an enthusiastic brain specialist who main- 
tained that, in every grade of the elementary school, 
instruction should be required in the anatomy of the 
human brain. That man was an expert in his own line. 
He knew more about the structure of the brain than 
any other living man. But knowing more about brain 
morphology also implied that he knew less about many 
other things, and among the things that he knew little 
about were the needs and capacities of children in the 
elementary school. He was a special pleader; he had 
been dealing with his special subject so long that it had 
assumed a disproportionate value in his eyes. Brain
-P-A-G-E-176
    166 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
morphology had given him fame, honor, and worldly 
emoluments. Naturally he would have an exaggerated 
notion of its value. 
It is the same with any other specialist. As special- 
ists in education, you and I are likely to overemphasize 
the importance of the common school in the scheme of 
creation. Personally I am convinced that the work of 
elementary education is the most profoundly significant 
work in the world; and yet I can realize that I should 
be no fit person to make comparisons if the welfare of a 
number of other professions and callings were at stake. 
I should let an unbiased judge make the final deter- 
mination. 
I 
The first question for which we should seek an answer 
in connection with the value of any school subject is 
this: How does it influence conduct? Let me insist 
at the outset that we cannot be definite by saying 
simply that we teach history in order to impart in- 
struction. If there is one thing upon which we are all 
agreed to-day it is this: that it is what our pupils do 
that counts, not what they know. The knowledge 
that they may possess has value only in so far as it 
may directly or indirectly be turned over into action. 
Let us not be mistaken upon this point. Knowledge 
is of the utmost importance, but it is important only as 
a means to an end—and the end is conduct. If my
-P-A-G-E-177
  A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 167 
pupils act in no way more efficiently after they have 
received my instruction than they would have acted 
had they never come under my influence, then my 
work as a teacher is a failure. If their conduct is less 
efficient, then my work is not only a failure, —it is a 
catastrophe. The knowledge that I impart may be 
absolutely true; the interest that I arouse may be 
intense; the affection that my pupils have for me may 
be genuine; but all these are but means to an end, and 
if the end is not attained, the means have been futile. 
We have faith that the materials which we pour in 
at the hopper of sense impression will come out sooner 
or later at the spout of reaction, transformed by some 
mysterious process into efficient conduct. While the 
machinery of the process, like the mills of the gods, 
certainly grinds slowly, it is some consolation to believe 
that, at any rate, it does grind; and we are perhaps fain 
to believe that the exceeding fineness of the grist is 
responsible for our failure to detect at the spout all of 
the elements that we have been so careful to pour in 
at the hopper. What I should like to do is to examine 
this grinding process rather carefully,—to gain, if 
possible, some definite notion of the kind of grist we 
should like to produce, and then to see how the ma- 
chinery may be made to produce this grist, and in what 
proportions we must mix the material that we pour into 
the hopper in order to gain the desired result. 
I have said that we must ask of every subject that 
{
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
we teach, How does it influence conduct? Now when 
we ask this question concerning history a variety of 
answers are at once proposed. One group of people 
will assert that the facts of history have value because 
they can be directly applied to the needs of contem- 
porary life. History, they will tell us, records the 
experiences of the race, and if we are to act intelligently 
we must act upon the basis of this experience. History 
informs us of the mistakes that former generations have 
made in adjusting themselves to the world. If we 
know history, we can avoid these mistakes. This type 
of reasoning may be said to ascribe a utilitarian value 
to the study of history. It assumes that historical 
knowledge is directly and immediately applicable to 
vital problems of the present day. 
Now the difficulty with this value, as with many   
      
others that seem to have the sanction of reason, is that 
it does not possess the sanction of practical test. While 
knowledge doubtless affects in some way the present 
policy of our own government, it would be very hard 
to prove that the influence is in any way a direct in- 
fluence. It is extremely doubtful whether the knowl- 
edge that the voters have of the history of their coun- 
try will be recalled and applied at the ballot box next 
November. I do not say that the study of history 
that has been going on in the common schools for a 
generation will be entirely without effect upon the 
coming election. I simply maintain that this influence
-P-A-G-E-179
  A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 169 
will be indirect, — but I believe that it will be none 
the less profound. One’s vote at the next election will 
be determined largely by immediate and present con- 
ditions. But the way in which one interprets these 
conditions cannot help being profoundly influenced by 
one’s historical study or lack of such study. 
If it is clear; then, that the study of history cannot 
be justified upon a purely utilitarian basis, we may 
pass to the consideration of other values that have been 
proposed. The specialist in history, whose right to 
legislate upon this matter I have just called into ques- 
tion, will probably emphasize the disciplinary value of 
this study. Specialists are commonly enthusiastic over 
the disciplinary value of their special subjects. - Their 
own minds have been so well developed by the pursuit 
of their special branches that they are impelled to rec- 
ommend the same discipline for all minds. Again, we 
must not blame the specialist in history, for you and I 
think the same about our own special type of activity. 
From the disciplinary point of view, the study of 
history is supposed to give one the mastery of a special 
method of reasoning. Historical method involves, above 
all else, the careful sifting of evidence, the minutest 
scrutiny of sources in order to judge whether or not the 
records are authentic, and the utmost care in coming 
to conclusions. Now it will be generally agreed that 
these are desirable types of skill to possess whether one 
is an historian or a lawyer or a teacher or a man of
-P-A-G-E-180
  179 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
business. And yet, as in all types of discipline, the 
difficulty lies, not so much in acquiring the specific 
skill, as in transferring the skill thus acquired to other 
fields of activity. Skill of any sort is made up of a 
multitude of little specific habits, and it is a current 
theory that habit functions effectively only in the 
specific situation in which it has been built up, or in 
situations closely similar. But whether this is true or 
not it is obvious that the teaching of elementary history 
provides very few opportunities for this type of training. 
A third view of the way in which historical knowl- 
edge is thought to work into action may be discussed 
under the head of the cultural value. History, like 
literature, is commonly assumed to give to the individual 
who studies it, a certain amount of that commodity 
which the world calls culture. Precisely what culture 
consists in, no one, apparently, is ready to tell us, but 
we all admit that it is real, if not tangible and definable, 
nor can we deny that the individual who possesses 
culture conducts himself, as a rule, differently from the 
individual who does not possess it. In other words, 
culture is a practical thing, for the only things that are 
practical are the things that modify or control human 
action. 
It is doubtless true that the study of history does add 
to this intangible something that we call ‘‘culture,” 
but the difficulty with this value lies in the fact that, 
even after we have accepted it as valid, we are in no
-P-A-G-E-181
A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 171 
way better off regarding our methods. Like many 
other theories, its truth is not to be denied, but its 
truth gives us no inkling of a solution of our problem. 
What we need is an educational value of history, the 
recognition of which will enable us to formulate a 
method for realizing the value. 
Til 
The unsatisfactory character of these three values 
that have been proposed for history — the utilitarian, 
the disciplinary, and the cultural —is typical of the 
values that have been proposed for other subjects. 
Unless the aim of teaching any given subject can be 
stated in definite terms, the teacher must work very 
largely in the dark; his efforts must be largely of the 
“hit-or-miss” order. The desired value may be realized 
under these conditions, but, if it is realized, it is mani- 
festly through accident, not through intelligent design. 
It is needless to point out the waste that such a blunder- 
ing and haphazard adjustment entails. We all know 
how much of our teaching fails to hit the mark, even 
when we are clear concerning the result that we desire; 
we can only conjecture how much of the remainder fails 
of effect because we are hazy and obscure concerning its 
purpose. 
Let us return to our original basic principle and see 
what light it may throw upon our problem. We have 
said that the efficiency of teaching must always be
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
measured by the degree in which the pupil’s conduct is 
modified. Taking conduct as our base, then, let us 
reason back and see what factors control conduct, 
and, if possible, how these “controls” may be influ- 
enced by the processes of education working through 
the lesson in history. 
I shall start with a very simple and apparently trivial 
example. When I was living in the Far West, I came 
to know something of the Chinese, who are largely en- 
gaged, as you know, in domestic service in that part of 
the country. Most of the Chinese servants that I met 
corresponded very closely with what we read concerning 
Chinese character. We have all heard of the Chinese 
servant’s unswerving adherence to a routine that he has 
once established. They say in the West that when a 
housewife gives her Chinese servant an object lesson in 
the preparation of a certain dish, she must always be 
very careful to make her demonstration perfect the 
first time. If, inadvertently, she adds one egg too 
many, she will find that, in spite of her protestations, 
the superfluous egg will always go into that preparation 
forever afterward. From what I know of the typical 
Oriental, I am sure that this warning is not over- 
drawn. 
Now here is a bit of conduct, a bit of adjustment, 
that characterizes the Chinese cook. Not only that, 
but, in a general way, it is peculiar to all Chinese, and 
hence may be called a national trait. We might call
-P-A-G-E-183
  A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 173 
it a vigorous national prejudice in favor of precedent. 
But whatever we call it, it is a very dominant force in 
Chinese life. It is the trait that, perhaps more than 
any other, distinguishes Chinese conduct from Euro- 
pean or American conduct. Now one might think this 
trait to be instinctive, — to be bred in the bone rather 
than acquired, — but this I am convinced is not alto- 
gether true. At least one Chinese whom I knew did 
not possess it at all. He was born on a western ranch 
and his parents died soon after his birth. He was 
brought up with the children of the ranch owner, and 
is now a prosperous rancher himself. He lacks every 
characteristic that we commonly associate with the 
Chinese, save only the physical features. His hair is 
straight, his skin is saffron, his eyes are slightly aslant, 
— but that is all. As far as his conduct goes, — and 
that is the essential thing, — he is an American. In 
other words, his traits, his tendencies to action, are 
American and not Chinese. His life represents the 
triumph of environment over heredity. 
When you visit England you find yourselves among a 
people who speak the same language that you speak, — 
or, perhaps it would be better to say, somewhat the 
same; at least you can understand each other. In a 
great many respects, the Englishman and the American 
are similar in their traits, but in a great many other 
respects they differ radically. You cannot, from your 
knowledge of American traits, judge what an English-
-P-A-G-E-184
174 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
man’s conduct will be upon every occasion. If you 
happened on Piccadilly of a rainy morning, for example, 
you would see the English clerks and storekeepers ‘and 
professional men riding to their work on the omnibuses 
that thread their way slowly through the crowded 
thoroughfare. No matter how rainy the morning, these 
men would be seated on the tops of the omnibuses, 
although the interior seats might be quite unoccupied. 
No matter how rainy the morning, many of these men 
would be faultlessly attired in top hats and frock coats, 
and there they would sit through the drizzling rain, 
protecting themselves most inadequately with their 
opened umbrellas. Now there is a bit of conduct that 
you cannot find duplicated in any American city. It 
is a national habit, — or, perhaps, it would be better 
to say, it is an expression of a national trait, — and 
that national trait is a prejudice in favor of conven- 
tion. It is the thing to do, and the typical English- 
man does it, just as, when he is sent as civil governor 
to some lonely outpost in India, with no companions 
except scantily clad native servants, he always dresses 
conscientiously for dinner and sits down to his solitary 
meal clad in the conventional swallow-tail coat of 
civilization. 
Now the way in which a Chinese cook prepares a 
custard, or the way in which an English merchant rides 
in an omnibus, may be trivial and unimportant matters 
in themselves, and yet, like the straw that shows which
-P-A-G-E-185
A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 175 
way the wind blows, they are indicative of vast and 
profound currents. The conservatism of the Chinese 
empire is only a larger and more comprehensive ex- 
pression of the same trait or prejudice that leads the 
cook to copy literally his model. The present educa- 
tional situation in England is only another expression 
of that same prejudice in favor of the established order, 
which finds expression in the merchant on the Piccadilly 
omnibus. 
Whenever you pass from one country to another you 
will find this difference in tendencies to action. In 
Germany, for example, you will find something that 
amounts almost to a national fervor for economy and 
frugality. You will find it expressing itself in the care 
with which the German housewife does her marketing. 
You will find it expressing itself in the intensive methods 
of agriculture, through which scarcely a square inch of 
arable land is permitted to lie fallow, — through which, 
for example, even the shade trees by the roadside fur- 
nish fruit as well as shade, and are annually rented for 
their fruit value to industrious members of the com- 
munity, — and it is said in one section of Germany 
that the only people known to steal fruit from these 
trees along the lonely country roads are American 
tourists, who, you will see, also have their peculiar 
standards of conduct. You will find this same fervor 
for frugality and economy expressing itself most ex- 
tensively in that splendid forest policy by means of
-P-A-G-E-186
  176 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
which the German states have conserved their magnifi- 
cent timber resources. 
But, whatever its expression, it is the same trait, — 
a trait born of generations of struggle with an un- 
yielding soil, and yet a trait which, combined with the 
German fervor for science and education, has made 
possible the marvelous progress that Germany has 
made within the last half century. 
What do we mean by national traits? Simply this: 
prejudices or tendencies toward certain typical forms 
of conduct, common to a given people. It is this com- 
munity of conduct that constitutes a nation. A coun- 
try whose people have different standards of action 
must be a divided country, as our own American history 
sufficiently demonstrates. Unless upon the vital ques- 
tions of human adjustment, men are able to agree, they 
cannot live together in peace. If we are a distinctive 
and unique nation,—if we hold a distinctive and 
unique place among the nations of the globe, —it is 
because you and I and the other inhabitants of our 
country have developed distinctive and unique ideals 
and prejudices and standards, all of which unite to 
produce a community of conduct. And once granting 
that our national characteristics are worth while, that 
they constitute a distinct advance over the characteris- 
tics of the other nations of the earth, it becomes the 
manifest duty of the school to do its share in perpetuat- 
ing these ideals and prejudices and standards. Once
-P-A-G-E-187
A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION Ley, 
let these atrophy through disuse, once let them fail of 
transmission because of the decay of the home, or the 
decay of the school, or the decay of the social institu- 
tions that typify and express them, and our country 
must go the way of Greece and Rome, and, although 
our blood may thereafter continue pure and unmixed, 
and our physical characteristics may be passed on from 
generation to generation unchanged in form, our nation 
will be only a memory, and its history ancient history. 
Some of the Greeks of to-day are the lineal descendants 
of the Athenians and Spartans, but the ancient Greek 
standards of conduct, the Greek ideals, died twenty 
centuries ago, to be resurrected, it is true, by the renais- 
sance, and to enjoy the glorious privilege of a new and 
wider sphere of life, — but among an alien people, and 
under a northern sun. 
And so the true aim of the study of history in the 
elementary school is not the realization of its utilitarian, 
its cultural, or its disciplinary value. It is not a mere 
assimilation of facts concerning historical events, nor 
the memorizing of dates, nor the picturing of battles, 
nor the learning of lists of presidents, — although each 
of these factors has its place in fulfilling the function of 
historical study. The true function of national history 
in our elementary schools is to establish in the pupils’ 
minds those ideals and standards of action which dif- 
ferentiate the American people from the rest of the 
world, and especially to fortify these ideals and stand- 
N 
   
-P-A-G-E-188
178 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
ards by a description of the events and conditions 
through which they developed. It is not the facts of 
history that are to be applied to the problems of life; 
it is rather the emotional attitude, the point of view, 
that comes not from memorizing, but from appreciating, 
the facts. A mere fact has never yet had a profound 
influence over human conduct. A principle that is 
accepted by the head and not by the heart has never 
yet stained a battle field nor turned the tide of a popu- 
lar election. Men act, not as they think, but as they 
feel, and it is not the idea, but the ideal, that is im- 
portant in history. 
IV 
But what are the specific ideals and standards for 
which our nation stands and which distinguish, in a 
very broad but yet explicit manner, our conduct from 
the conduct of other peoples? If we were to ask this 
"question of an older country, we could more easily 
obtain an answer, for in the older countries the national 
ideals have, in many cases, reached an advanced point 
of self-consciousness. The educational machinery of 
the German empire, for example, turns upon this prob- 
lem of impressing the national ideals. It is one aim of 
the official courses of study, for instance, that history 
shall be so taught that the pupils will gain an overweening 
reverence for the reigning house of Hohenzollern. Nor 
is that newer ideal of national unity which had its seed
-P-A-G-E-189
  
A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 179 
sown in the Franco-Prussian War in any danger of neg- 
lect by the watchful eye of the government. Not only 
must the teacher impress it upon every occasion, but 
every attempt is also made to bring it daily fresh to the 
minds of the people through great monuments and me- 
morials. Scarcely a hamlet is so small that it does not 
possess its Bismarck Denkmal, often situated upon some 
commanding hill, telling to each generation, in the sub- 
lime poetry of form, the greatness of the man who made 
German unity a reality instead of a dream. 
But in our country, we do not thus consciously formu- 
late and express our national ideals. We recognize them 
rather with averted face as the adolescent boy recog- 
nizes any virtue that he may possess, as if half-ashamed 
of his weakness. We have monuments to our heroes, 
it is true, but they are often inaccessible, and as often 
they fail to convey in any adequate manner, the great- 
neés of the lessons which the lives of these heroes repre- 
sent. Where Germany has a hundred or more im- 
pressive memorials to the genius of Bismarck, we have 
but one adequate memorial to the genius of Washington, 
while for Lincoln, who represents the typical American 
standards of life and conduct more faithfully than 
any other one character in our history, we have no 
memorial that is at all adequate, — and we should have 
a thousand. Some day our people will awake to the 
possibilities that inhere in these palpable expressions of 
the impalpable things for which our country stands. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
We shall come to recognize the vast educative im- 
portance of perpetuating, in every possible way, the 
deep truths that have been established at the cost of 
so much blood and treasure. 
To embody our national ideals in the personages of 
the great figures of history who did so much to estab- 
lish them is the most elementary method of insuring 
their conservation and transmission. We are beginning 
to appreciate the value of this method in our introduc- 
tory courses of history in the intermediate and lower 
grammar grades. The historical study outlined for 
these grades in most of our state and city school pro- 
grams includes mainly biographical materials. As long 
as the purpose of this study is kept steadily in view 
by the teacher, its value may be very richly realized. 
The danger lies in an obscure conception of the pur- 
pose. We are always too prone to teach history didac- 
tically, and to teach biographical history didactically 
is to miss the mark entirely. The aim here is not pri- 
marily instruction, but inspiration; not merely learning, 
but also appreciation. To tell the story of Lincoln’s life 
in such a way that its true value will be realized requires 
first upon the part of the teacher a sincere appreciation 
of the great lesson of Lincoln’s life. Lincoln typifies the 
most significant and representative of American ideals. 
His career stands for and illustrates the greatest of our 
national principles, — the principle of equality, — not 
the equality of birth, not the equality of social station,
-P-A-G-E-191
  
A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 181 
but the equality of opportunity. That a child of the 
lowliest birth, reared under conditions apparently the 
most unfavorable for rich development, limited by the 
sternest poverty, by lack of formal education, by lack 
of family pride and traditions, by lack of an environ- 
ment of culture, by the hard necessity of earning his 
own livelihood almost from earliest childhood, — that 
such a man should attain to the highest station in the 
land and the proudest eminence in its history, and 
should have acquired from the apparently unfavorable 
environment of his early life the very qualities that 
made him so efficient in that station and so permanent 
in that eminence, — this is a miracle that only America 
could produce. It is this conception that the teacher 
must have, and this he must, in some measure, im- 
press upon his pupils. 
Vv 
In the teaching of history in the elementary school, 
the biographical treatment is followed in the later gram- 
mar grades by a systematic study of the main events 
of American history. Here the method is different, 
but the purpose is the same. This purpose is, I take 
it, to show how our ideals and standards have developed, 
through what struggles and conflicts they have become 
firmly established; and the aim must be to have our 
pupils relive, as vividly as possible, the pain and the 
struggles and the striving and the triumph, to the end 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  182 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
that they may appreciate, however feebly, the heritage 
that is theirs. 
Here again it is not the facts as such that are im- 
portant, but the emotional appreciation of the facts, and 
to this end, the coloring must be rich, the pictures 
vivid, the contrasts sharply drawn. The successful 
teacher of history has the gift of making real the past. 
His pupils struggle with Columbus against a frightened, 
ignorant, mutinous crew; they toil with the Pilgrim 
fathers to conquer the wilderness; they follow the 
bloody trail of the Deerfield victims through the forest 
to Canada; they too resist the encroachments of the 
Mother Country upon their rights as English citizens; 
they suffer through the long winter at Valley Forge and 
join with Washington in his midnight vigils; they re- 
joice at Yorktown; they dream with Jefferson and 
plead with Webster; their hearts are fired with the 
news of Sumter; they clinch their teeth at Bull Run; 
they gather hope at Donelson, but they shudder at 
Shiloh; they struggle through the Wilderness with 
Grant; tired but triumphant, they march home from 
Appomattox; and through it all, in virtue of the limit- 
less capacities of vicarious experience, they have shared 
the agonies of Lincoln. 
Professor Mace, in his essay on Method in History, 
tells us that there are two distinct phases to every his- 
torical event. These are the event itself and the hu- 
man feeling that brought it forth. It has seemed to
-P-A-G-E-193
  
A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 183, 
me that there are three phases, — the event itself, the 
feeling that brought it forth, and the feeling to which 
it gave birth; for no event is historically important 
unless it has transformed in some way the ideals and 
standards of the people, — unless it has shifted, in some 
way, their point of view, and made them act differently 
from the way in which they would have acted had the 
event never occurred. One leading purpose in the teach- 
ing of history is to show how ideals have been trans- 
formed, how we have come to have standards different 
from those that were once held. 
Many of our national ideals have their roots deep 
down in English history. Not long ago I heard a 
seventh-grade class discussing the Magna Charta. It 
was a class in American history, and yet the events that 
the pupils had been studying occurred three centuries 
before the discovery of America. They had become 
familiar with the long list of abuses that led to the 
granting of the charter. They could tell very glibly 
what this great document did for the English people. 
They traced in detail the subsequent events that led 
to the establishment of the House of Commons. All 
this was American history just as truly as if the events 
described had occurred on American soil. They were 
gaining an appreciation of one of the most fundamental 
of our national ideals, — the ideal of popular govern- 
ment. And not only that, but they were studying 
popular government in its simplest form, uncomplicated
-P-A-G-E-194
    
184 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
by the innumerable details and the elaborate or- 
ganizations which characterize popular government 
to-day. 
And when these pupils come to the time when this 
ideal of self-government was transplanted to American 
soil, they will be ready to trace with intelligence the 
changes that it took on. They will appreciate the 
marked influence which geographical conditions exert 
in shaping national standards of action. How. richly 
American history reveals and illustrates this influence 
we are only just now beginning to appreciate. The 
French and the English colonists developed different 
types of national character partly because they were 
placed under different geographical conditions. The 
St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes gave the French an 
easy means of access into the vast interior of the con- 
tinent, and provided innumerable temptations. to ex- 
ploitation rather than a few incentives to development. 
Where the French influence was dispersed over a wide 
territory, the English influence was concentrated. As 
a consequence, the English energy went to the develop- 
ment of resources that were none too abundant, and to 
the establishment of permanent institutions that would 
conserve these resources. The barrier of the Appalachi- 
ans hemmed them in, — three hundred miles of alternate 
ridge and valley kept them from the West until they 
were numerically able to settle rather than to exploit 
this country. Not a little credit for the ultimate Eng-  
-P-A-G-E-195
  
A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 185 
lish domination of the continent must be given to these 
geographical conditions. 
But geography does not tell the whole story. The 
French colonists differed from the English colonists 
from the outset in standards of conduct. They had 
brought with them the principle of paternalism, and, 
in time of trouble, they looked to France for support. 
The English colonists brought with them the principle 
of self-reliance and, in time of trouble, they looked only 
to themselves. And so the old English ideals had a 
new birth and a broader field of application on Ameri- 
can soil. There is nothing finer in our country’s history 
than the attitude of the New England colonists during 
the intercolonial wars. Their northern frontier cover- 
ing two hundred miles of unprotected territory was 
constantly open to the incursions of the French from 
Canada and their Indian allies, to appease whom the 
French organized their raids. And yet, so deeply im- 
planted was this ideal of self-reliance that New Eng- 
land scarcely thought of asking aid of the mother coun- 
try and would have protested to the last against the 
permanent establishment of a military garrison within 
her ‘Jimits. For a period extending over fifty years, 
New England protected her own borders. She felt the 
terrors 6f savage warfare in its most sanguinary forms. 
And yet, uncomplaining, she taxed herself to repel the 
invaders. The people loved their own independence 
too much to part with it, even for the sake of peace, 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  186 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
prosperity, and security. At a later date, unknown to 
the mother country, they raised and equipped from their 
own young men and at their own expense, the punitive 
expedition that, in the face of seemingly certain defeat, 
captured the French fortress at Louisburg, and gave 
to English military annals one of its most brilliant 
victories. To get the pupil to live through these 
struggles, to feel the impetus of idealism upon conduct, 
to appreciate what that almost forgotten half-century 
of conflict meant to the development of our national 
character, would be to realize the greatest value that 
colonial history can have for its students. It lays bare 
the source of that strength which made New England 
preéminent in the Revolution, and which has placed 
the mint mark of New England idealism upon the coin 
of American character. Could a pupil who has lived 
vicariously through such experiences as these easily for- 
sake principle for policy ? 
A newspaper cartoon published a year or so ago, gives 
some notion of the danger that we are now facing of 
losing that idealism upon which our country was founded. 
The cartoon represents the signing of the Declaration of 
Independence. The worthies are standing about the 
table dressed in the knee breeches and flowing coats of the 
day, with wigs conventionally powdered and that stately 
bearing which characterizes the typical historical paint- 
ing. John Hancock is seated at the table prepared to 
make his name immortal. A figure, however, has just
-P-A-G-E-197
A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 187 
appeared in the doorway. It is the cartoonist’s conven- 
tional conception of the modern Captain of Industry. 
His silk hat is on the back of his head as if he had 
ffice as fast as his forty-horse-power   
    
just come from his o: 
automobile could carry him. His portly form shows 
evidences of intense excitement. He is holding his 
hand aloft to stay the proceedings, while from his lips 
comes the stage whisper: “Gentlemen, stop! You will 
hurt business !”” What would those old New England 
fathers think, could they know that such a conception 
may be taken as representing a well-recognized tendency 
of the present day? And remember, too, that those old   
heroes had something of a passion for trade themselves. 
But when we seek for the source of our most important 
national ideal, — the ideal that we have called equality 
of opportunity, — we must look to another part ofthe 
country. The typical Americanism that is represented 
by Lincoln owes its origin, I believe, very largely to geo- 
graphical factors. It could have been developed only 
under certain conditions and these conditions the Middle 
West alone provided. The settling of the Middle West 
in the latter part of the eighteenth and the early part of 
the nineteenth centuries was part and parcel of a rigid 
logic of events. As Miss Semple so clearly points out in 
her work on the geographic conditions of American his- 
tory, the Atlantic seaboard sloped toward the sea and 
its people held their faces eastward. They were never 
cut off from easy communication with the Old World,
-P-A-G-E-198
188 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
and consequently they were never quite freed from the 
Old World prejudices and standards. But the move- 
ment across the mountains gave rise to a new condition. 
The faces of the people were turned westward, and cut 
off from easy communication with the Old World, they 
developed a new set of ideals and standards under the 
stress of new conditions. Chief among these conditions 
was the immensity and richness of the territory that 
they were settling. The vastness of their outlook and 
the wealth of their resources confirmed and extended the 
ideals of self-reliance that they had brought with them 
from the seaboard. But on the seaboard, the Old World 
notion of social classes, the prestige of family and sta- 
tion, still held sway. The development of the Middle 
West would have been impossible under so severe a 
handicap. With resources so great, every stimulus must 
be given to individual achievement. Nothing must be 
permitted to stand in its way. The man who could do 
things, the man who could most effectively turn the 
forces of nature to serve the needs of society, was the 
man who was selected for preferment, no matter what 
his birth, no matter what the station of his family. 
We might, in a similar fashion, review the various other 
ideals, which have grown out of our history, but, as I have 
said, my purpose is not historical but educational, and 
the illustrations that I have given may suffice to make my 
contention clear. I have attempted to show that the 
chief purpose of the study of history in the elementary
-P-A-G-E-199
  A PLEA FOR THE DEFINITE IN EDUCATION 189 
school is to establish and fortify in the pupils’ minds the 
significant ideals and standards of conduct which those 
who have gone before us have gleaned from their ex- 
perience. I have maintained that, to this end, it is not 
only the facts of history that are important, but the ap- 
preciation of these facts. I have maintained that these 
prejudices and ideals have a profound influence upon 
conduct, and that, consequently, history is to be looked 
upon as a most practical branch of study. 
The best way in this world to be definite is to know our 
goal and then strive to attain it. In the lack of definite 
standards based upon the lessons of the past, our domi- 
nant national ideals shift with every shifting wind of 
public sentiment and popular demand. Are we satisfied 
with the individualistic and self-centered idealism that 
has come with our material prosperity and which to-day 
shames the memory of the men who founded our Re- 
public? Are we negligent of the serious menace that 
confronts any people when it loses its hold upon those 
goods of life that are far more precious than commercial 
prestige and individual aggrandizement? Are we losing 
our hold upon the sterner virtues which our fathers pos- 
sessed, —upon the things of the spirit that are permanent 
and enduring? 
A study of history cannot determine entirely the domi- 
nant ideals of those who pursue it. But the study of 
history if guided in the proper spirit and dominated by
-P-A-G-E-200
190 f CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
the proper aim may help. For no one who gets into the 
spirit of our national history, — no one who traces the 
origin and growth of these ideals and institutions that I 
have named,— can escape the conviction that the 
elemental virtues of courage, self-reliance, hardihood, 
unselfishness, self-denial, and service lie at the basis of 
every forward step that this country has made, and that 
the most precious part of our heritage is not the material 
comforts with which we are surrounded, but the sturdy 
virtues which made these comforts possible.

ScIENCE AS RELATED TO THE TEACHING OF LITERA- 
TURE! 
THE scientific method is the method of unprejudiced 
observation and induction. Its function in the scheme 
of life is to furnish man with facts and principles, — state- 
ments which mirror with accuracy and precision the con- 
ditions that may exist in any situation of any sort which 
man may have to face. In.other words, the facts of 
science are important and worthy because they help us 
to solve the problems of life more satisfactorily. They 
are instrumental in their function. They are means to an 
end. And whenever we have a problem to solve, when- 
ever we face a situation that demands some form of ad- 
justment, the more accurate the information that we 
possess concerning this situation, the better we shall be 
able to solve it. 
Now when I propose that we try to find out some facts 
about the teaching of English, and that we apply the 
scientific method in the discovery of these facts, I am 
immediately confronted with an objection. My oppo-

nent will maintain that the subject of English in our 
school curriculum is not one of the sciences. Taking 
English to mean particularly English literature rather 
than rhetoric or composition or grammar, it is clear that 
we do not teach literature as we teach the sciences. Its 
function differs from that of science in the curriculum. 
If there is a science of literature, that is not what we are - 
teaching in the secondary schools, and that is not what 
most of us believe should be taught in the secondary 
schools. We think that the study of literature should 
transmit to each generation the great ideals that are crys- 
tallized in literary masterpieces. And we think that, in 
seeing to it that our pupils are inspired with these ideals, 
we should also teach literature in such a way that our 
pupils will be left with a desire to read good literature as 
a source of recreation and inspiration after they have fin- 
ished the courses that we offer. When I speak of “‘in- 
” “appreciation,” the development of ‘‘taste,”. spiration, 
and the like, I am using terms that have little direct 
relation to the scientific method; for, as I have said, 
science deals with facts, and the harder and more stub- 
born and more unyielding the facts become, the better 
they represent true science. What right have I, then, 
to speak of the scientific study of the teaching of Eng- 
lish, when science and literature seem to belong to two 
quite separate rubrics of mental life? 
I refer to this point of view, not because its inconsist- 
encies are not fully apparent to you even upon the sur-
-P-A-G-E-203
SCIENCE AS RELATED TO LITERATURE 193 
face, but because it is a point of view that has hitherto 
interfered very materially with our educational progress. 
It has sometimes been assumed that, because we wish to 
study education scientifically, we wish to read out of it 
everything that cannot be reduced to a scientific formula, 
— that, somehow or other, we intend still further to in- 
tellectualize the processes of education and to neglect the 
tremendous importance of those factors that are not 
primarily intellectual in their nature, but which belong 
rather to the field of emotion and feeling. 
I wish, therefore, to say at the outset that, while I 
firmly believe the hope of education to lie in the applica- 
tion of the scientific method to the solution of its prob- 
lems, I still hold that neither facts nor principles nor 
any other products of the scientific method are the most 
important “goods” of life. The greatest “goods” in 
life are, and always must remain, I believe, its ideals, 
its visions, its insights, and its sympathies, — must al- 
ways remain those qualities with which the teaching of 
literature is primarily concerned, and in the engendering 
of which in the hearts and souls of his pupils, the teacher 
of literature finds the greatest opportunity that is 
vouchsafed to any teacher. 
The facts and principles that science has given us 
have been of such service to humanity that we are prone 
to forget that they have been of service because they 
have helped us more effectively to realize our ideals and 
attain our ends; and we are prone to forget also that, 
oO
-P-A-G-E-204
    194 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
without the ideals and the ends and the visions, the facts 
and principles would be quite without function. I have 
sometimes been taken to account for separating these 
two factors in this way. But unless we do distinguish 
sharply between them, our educational thinking is bound 
to be hopelessly obscure. 
You have all heard the story of the great chemist who 
was at work in his laboratory when word was brought 
him that his wife was dead. As the first wave of anguish 
swept over him, he bowed his head upon his hands and 
wept out his grief; but suddenly he lifted up his head, 
and held before him his hands wet with tears. “Tears!” 
he cried; “what are they? I have analyzed them: 
a little chloride of sodium, some alkaline salts, a little 
mucin, and some water. That is all.” And he went 
back to his work. 
The story is an old one, and very likely apocryphal, 
but it is not without its lesson to us in the present 
connection. Unless we distinguish between these two 
factors that I have named, we are likely either to take 
this man’s attitude or something approaching it, or to 
go to the other extreme, renounce the accuracy and pre- 
cision of the scientific method, and give ourselves up 
to the cult of emotionalism. 
Now, while we do not wish to read out of the teaching 
of literature the factors of appreciation and inspiration, 
we do wish to find out how these important functions of 
our teaching may be best fulfilled. And it is here that
-P-A-G-E-205
SCIENCE AS RELATED TO LITERATURE 195 
facts and principles gained by the scientific method not 
only can but must furnish the ultimate solution. We 
have a problem. That problem, it is true, is concerned 
with something that is not scientific, and to attempt 
to make it scientific is to kill the very life that it is our 
problem to cherish. But in solving that problem, we 
must take certain steps; we must arrange our materials 
in certain ways; we must adjust hard and stubborn facts 
to the attainment of our end. What are these facts? 
What is their relation to our problem? What laws gov- 
ern their operation? These are subordinate but very 
essential parts of our larger problem, and it is through the 
scientific investigation of these subordinate problems 
that our larger problem is to be solved. 
Let me give you an illustration of what I mean. We 
may assume that every boy who goes out of the high 
school should appreciate the meaning and worth of self- 
sacrifice as this is revealed (not expounded) in Dickens’s 
delineation of the character of Sidney Carton. There is 
our problem, — but what a host of subordinate problems 
at once confront us! Where shall we introduce The 
Tale of Two Cities? Will it be in the second year, or the 
third, or the fourth? Will it be best preceded by the 
course in general history which will give the pupil a time 
perspective upon the crimson background of the French 
Revolution against which Dickens projected his master 
character? Or shall we put The Tale of Two Cities first 
for the sake of the heightened interest which the art of 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  196 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
the novelist may lend to the facts of the historian? 
Again, how may the story be best presented? What 
part shall the pupils read in class? What part shall they 
read at home? What part, if any, shall we read to 
them? What questions are necessary to insure appreci- 
ation? How many of the allusions need be run down 
in order to give the maximal effect of the masterpiece ? 
How may the necessarily discontinuous discussions of the 
class — one period each day for several days— be so 
counteracted as to insure the cumulative emotional 
effect which the appreciation of all art presupposes? 
Should the story be sketched through first, and then 
read in some detail, or will one reading suffice ? 
These are problems, I repeat, that stand to the chief 
problem as means stand to end. Now some of these 
questions must be solved by every teacher for himself, 
but that does not prevent each teacher from solving them 
scientifically. Others, it is clear, might be solved once 
and for all by the right kind of an investigation, —might 
result in permanent and universal laws which any one 
could apply. 
There are, of course, several ways in which answers 
for these questions may be secured. One way is that of 
@ priori reasoning, — the deductive procedure. This 
method may be thoroughly scientific, depending of course 
upon the validity of our general principles as applied to 
the specific problem. Ordinarily this validity can be 
determined only by trial; consequently these a priori  
-P-A-G-E-207
  
SCIENCE AS RELATED TO LITERATURE 197 
inferences should be looked upon as hypotheses to be 
tested by trial under standard conditions. For example, 
I might argue that The Tale of Two Cities should be 
placed in the third year because the emotional ferment 
of adolescence is then most favorable for the engender- 
ing of the ideal. But in the first place, this assumed 
principle would itself be subject to grave question and 
it would also have to be determined whether there is 
so little variation among the pupils in respect of physio- 
logical age as to permit the application to all of a gen- 
eralization that might conceivably apply only to the 
average child. In other words, all of our generalizations 
applying to average pupils must be applied with a 
knowledge of the extent and range of variation from 
the average. Some people say that there is no such 
thing as an average child, but, for all practical purposes, 
the average child is a very real reality, —he is, in fact, 
more numerous than any other single class; but this 
does not mean that there may be not enough variations 
from the average to make unwise the application of our 
principle. 
I refer to this hypothetical case to show the extreme 
difficulty of reaching anything more than hypotheses by 
@ priori reasoning. We have a certain number of fairly 
well established general principles in secondary education. 
Perhaps those most frequently employed are our generali- 
zations regarding adolescence and its influences upon the 
mental and especially the emotional life of high-school 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
    198 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
pupils. Stanley Hall’s work in this field is wonderfully 
stimulating and suggestive, and yet we should not forget 
that most of his generalizations are, after all, only plau- 
sible hypotheses to be acted upon as tentative guides for 
practice and to be tested carefully under controlled condi- 
tions, rather than to be accepted as immutable and un- 
changeable laws. We sometimes assume that all high- 
school pupils are adolescents, when the likelihood is that 
an appreciable proportion of pupils in the first two years 
have not yet reached this important node of their devel- 
opment. 
I say this not to minimize in any way the importance 
that attaches to adolescent characteristics, but rather to 
suggest that you who are daily dealing with these pupils 
can in the aggregate add immeasurably to the knowledge 
that we now have concerning this period. A tremen- 
dous waste is constantly going on in that most precious 
of all our possible resources, — namely, human experi- 
ence. How many problems that are well solved have 
to be solved again and again because the experience has 
not been crystallized in a well-tested fact or principle; 
how many experiences that might be well worth the effort 
that they cost are quite worthless because, in undergoing 
them, we have neglected some one or another of the rules 
that govern inexorably the validity of our inferences 
and conclusions. That is all that the scientific method 
means in the last analysis: it is a system of principles that 
enable us to make our experience worth while in meeting
-P-A-G-E-209
  SCIENCE AS RELATED TO LITERATURE 199 
later situations. We all have the opportunity of con- 
tributing to the sum total of human knowledge, if only 
we know the rules of the game. 
I said that one way of solving these subordinate prob- 
lems that arise in the realization of our chief aims in 
teaching is the a priori method of applying general prin- 
ciples to the problems. Another method is to imitate 
the way in which we have seen some one else handle the 
situation. Now this may be the most effective way 
possible. In fact, if a sufficient number of generations of 
teachers keep on blindly plunging in and floundering 
about in solving their problems, the most effective 
methods will ultimately be evolved through what we call 
the process of trial and error. The teaching of the very 
oldest subjects in the curriculum is almost always the best 
and most effective teaching, for the very reason that the 
blundering process has at last resulted in an effective 
procedure. But the scientific method of solving prob- 
lems has its very function in preventing the tremendous 
waste that this process involves. English literature is a 
comparatively recent addition to the secondary curricu- 
lum. Its possibilities of service are almost unlimited. 
Shall we wait for ten or fifteen generations of teachers to 
blunder out the most effective means of teaching it, or 
shall we avail ourselves of these simple principles which 
will enable us to concentrate this experience within one 
or two generations ? 
T should like to emphasize one further point. No one  
-P-A-G-E-210
  200 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
has greater respect than I have for what we term experi- 
ence in teaching. But let me say that a great deal of 
what we may term “crude” experience — that is, ex- 
perience that has not been refined by the application of 
scientific method —is most untrustworthy, — unless, 
indeed, it has been garnered and winnowed and sifted 
through the ages. Let me give you an example of some 
accepted dictums of educational experience that con- 
trolled investigations have shown to be untrustworthy. 
It is a general impression among teachers that specific 
habits may be generalized; that habits of neatness and 
accuracy developed in one line of work, for example, will 
inevitably make one neater and more accurate in other 
things. It has been definitely proved that this transfer 
of training does not take place inevitably, but in reality 
demands the fulfillment of certain conditions of which 
education has become fully conscious only within a com- 
paratively short time, and as a result of careful, system- 
atic, controlled experimentation. The meaning of this 
in the prevention of waste through inadequate teaching 
is fully apparent. 
Again, it has been supposed by many teachers that the 
home environment is a large factor in the success or failure 
of a pupil in school. In every accurate and controlled 
investigation that has been conducted so far it has been 
shown that this factor in such subjects as arithmetic and 
spelling at least is so small as to be absolutely negligible 
in practice.
-P-A-G-E-211
  
“SCIENCE AS RELATED TO LITERATURE 201 
Some people still believe that a teacher is born and not 
made, and yet a careful investigation of the efficiency of 
elementary teachers shows that, when such teachers 
were ranked by competent judges, specialized training 
stood out as the most important factor in general effi- 
ciency. In this same investigation, the time-honored 
notion that a college education will, irrespective of 
specialized training, adequately equip a teacher for his 
work was revealed as a fallacy,— for twenty-eight 
per cent of the normal-school graduates among all the 
teachers were in the first and second ranks of efficiency 
as against only seventeen per cent of the college gradu- 
ates; while, in the two lowest ranks, only sixteen per 
cent of the normal-school graduates are to be found as 
against forty-four per cent of the college graduates. 
These investigations, I may add, were made by uni- 
versity professors, and I am giving them here in a 
university classroom and as a university representative. 
And of course I shall hasten to add that general scholar- 
ship is one important essential. Our mistake has been 
in assuming sometimes that it is the only essential. 
Very frequently the controlled experience of scientific 
investigation confirms a principle that has been derived 
from crude experience. Most teachers will agree, for 
example, that a certain amount of drill and repetition is 
absolutely essential in the mastery of any subject. Every 
time that scientific investigation has touched this prob- 
lem it has unmistakably confirmed this belief. Some very 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  202 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
recent investigations made by Mr. Brown at the Charles- 
ton Normal School show conclusively that five-minute 
drill periods preceding every lesson in arithmetic place 
pupils who undergo such periods far in advance of others 
who spend this time in non-drill arithmetical work, and 
that this improvement holds not only in the number 
habits, but also in the reasoning processes. 
Other similar cases could be cited, but I have proba- 
bly said enough to make my point, and my point is 
this: that crude experience is an unsafe guide for prac- 
tice; that experience may be refined in two ways — 
first by the slow, halting, wasteful operation of time, 
which has established many principles upon a pinnacle 
of security from which they will never be shaken, but 
which has also accomplished this result at the cost of in- 
numerable mistakes, blunders, errors, futile efforts, and 
heartbreaking failures; or secondly, by the application 
of the principles of control and test which are now at our 
service, and which permit present-day teachers to con- 
centrate within a single generation the growth and devel- 
opment and progress that the empirical method of trial 
and error could not encompass in a millennium. 
The teaching of English merits treatment by this 
method. I recommend strongly that you give the plan 
a trial. You may not get immediate results. You may 
not get valuable results. But in any case, if you care- 
fully respect the scientific proprieties, your experience 
will be worth vastly more than ten times the amount of
-P-A-G-E-213
  SCIENCE AS RELATED TO LITERATURE 203 
crude experience; and, whether you get results or not, 
you will undergo a valuable discipline from which may 
emerge the ideals of science if you are not already 
imbued with them. I always tell my students that, 
even in the study of science itself, it is the ideals of 
science, — the ideals of patient, thoughtful work, the 
ideals of open-mindedness and caution in reaching con- 
clusions, the ideals of unprejudiced observation from 
which selfishness and personal desire are eliminated, — 
it is these ideals that are vastly more important than 
the facts of science as such, — and these latter are sig- 
nificant enough to have made possible our present prog- 
ress and our present amenities of life.

WANDERING about in a circle through a thick forest is 
perhaps an overdrawn analogy to our activity in at- 
tempting to construct educational theories; and yet 
there is a resemblance. We push out hopefully — and 
often boastfully — into the unknown wilderness, abso- 
lutely certain that we are pioneering a trail that will 
later become the royal highway to learning. We 
struggle on, ruthlessly using the hatchet and the ax 
to clear the road before us. And all too often we come 
back to our starting point, having unwittingly described 
a perfect circle, instead of the straight line that we had 
anticipated. 
But I am not a pessimist, and I like to believe that, 
although our course frequently resembles a circle, it is 
much better to characterize it as a spiral, and that, 
although we do get back to a point that we recognize, 
it is not, after all, our old starting point; it is an ho- 
mologous point on a higher plane. We have at least 
climbed a little, even if we have not traveled in a straight 
line.

THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 205 
Now in a figurative way this explains how we have 
come to take our present attitude toward the problem 
of drill or training in the process of education. Drilk— 
means the repetition of a process until it has become 
mechanical or automatic. It means the kind of dis- 
cipline that the recruit undergoes in the army, — the 
making of a series of complicated movements so thor- 
oughly automatic that they will be gone through with 
accurately and precisely, at the word of command. It 
means the sort of discipline that makes certain activi- 
ties machine-like in their operation, —so that we do 
not have to think about which one comes next. Thus 
the mind is relieved of the burden of looking after the 
innumerable details and may use its precious energy 
for a more important purpose. 
In every adult life, a large number of these mechan- 
ized responses are absolutely essential to efficiency. 
Modern civilized life is so highly organized that it 
demands a multitude of reactions and adjustments 
which primitive life did not demand. It goes without 
saying that there are innumerable little details of our 
daily work that must be reduced to the plane of un- 
varying habit. These details vary: with the trade or 
profession of the individual; hence general education 
cannot hope to supply the individual with all of the 
automatic responses that he will need. But, in addition 
to these specialized responses, there is a large mass of 
responses that are common to every member of the
-P-A-G-E-216
206 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
social group. We must all be able to communicate 
with one another, both through the medium of speech, 
and through the medium of written and printed sym- 
bols. We live in a society that is founded upon the 
principle of the division of labor. We must exchange 
the products of our labor for the necessities of life that 
we do not ourselves produce, and hence arises the ne- 
cessity for the short cuts to counting and measurement 
which we call arithmetic. And finally we must all live 
together in something at least approaching harmony; 
hence the thousand and one little responses that mean 
courtesy and good manners must be made thoroughly 
automatic. 
Now education, from the very earliest times, has 
recognized the necessity of building up these auto- 
matic responses, — of fixing these essential habits in all 
individuals. This recognition has often been short- 
sighted and sometimes even blind; but it has served 
to hold education rather tenaciously to a process that 
all must admit to be essential. rr 
Drill or training, however, is unfortunate in one im- 
portant particular. It invariably involves repetition ; 
and conscious, explicit repetition tends to become 
monotonous. We must hold attention to the drill 
process, and yet attention abhors monotony as nature 
abhors a vacuum. Consequently no small part of the 
tedium and irksomeness of school work has been due 
to its emphasis of drill. The formalism of the older
-P-A-G-E-217
THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 207 
schools has been described, criticized, and lampooned in 
professional literature, and even in the pages of fiction. 
The disastrous results that follow from engendering 
in pupils a disgust for school and all that it represents 
have been eloquently portrayed. Along with the 
tendency toward ease and comfort in other departments 
of human life has gone a parallel tendency to relieve 
the school of this odious burden of formal, lifeless, 
repetitive work. 
This “reform movement,” as I shall call it, repre- 
sents our first plunge into the wilderness. We would 
get away from the entanglements of drill and into the 
clearings of pleasurable, spontaneous activities. A new 
sun of hope dawned upon the educational world. 
You are all familiar with some of the more spectac- 
ular results of this movement. You have heard of 
the schools that eliminated drill processes altogether, 
and depended upon clear initial development to fix the 
facts and formule and reactions that every one needs. 
You have heard and perhaps seen some of the schools 
that were based entirely upon the doctrine of spon- 
taneity, governing their work by the principle that the 
child should never do anything that he did not wish 
to do at the moment of doing, — although the advo- 
cates of this theory generally qualified their principle 
by insisting that the skillful teacher would have the 
child wish to do the right thing all the time. 
Let me describe to you a school of this type that I
-P-A-G-E-218
  208 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
once visited. I learned of it through a resident of 
the city in which it was located. He was delivering 
an address before an educational gathering on the 
problems of modern education. He told the audience 
that, in the schools of this enlightened city, the an- 
tiquated notions that were so pernicious had been 
entirely dispensed with. He said that pupils in these 
schools were no longer repressed; that all regimenta- 
tion, line passing, static posture, and other barbaric 
practices had been abolished; that the pupils were free 
to work out their own destiny, to realize themselves, 
through all forms of constructive activity; that drills 
had been eliminated; that corporal punishment was 
never even mentioned, much less practiced; that all 
was harmony, and love, and freedom, and spontaneity. 
I listened to this speaker with intense interest, and, 
as his picture unfolded, I became more and more con- 
vinced that this city had at last solved the problem. 
I took the earliest opportunity to visit its schools. When 
I reached the city I went to the superintendent's office. 
I asked to be directed to the best school. ‘Our schools 
are all ‘best,’” the secretary told me with an intona- 
tion that denoted commendable pride, and which cer- 
tainly made me feel extremely humble, for here even 
the laws of logic and of formal grammar had been 
transcended. I made bold to apologize, however, and 
amended my request to make it apparent that I wished 
to see the largest school. I was directed to take a cer-
-P-A-G-E-219
  
THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 209 
tain car and, in due time, found myself at the school. 
I inferred that recess was in progress when I reached 
the building, and that the recess was being celebrated 
within doors. After some time spent in dodging about 
the corridors, I at last located the principal. 
I introduced myself and asked if I could visit his 
school after recess was over. “We have no recesses 
here,” he replied (I could just catch his voice above 
the din of the corridors); “this is a relaxation period 
for some of the classes.” He led the way to the office, 
and I spent a few moments in getting the “lay of the 
land.” I asked him, first, whether he agreed with the 
doctrines that the system represented, and he told me 
that he believed in them implicitly. Did he follow them 
out consistently in the operation of his school? Yes, he 
followed them out to the letter. 
We then went to several classrooms, where I saw chil- 
dren realizing themselves, I thought, very effectively. 
There were three groups at work in each room. One 
recited to the teacher, another studied at the seats, a 
third did construction work at the tables. I inquired 
about the mechanics of this rather elaborate organiza- 
tion, but I was told that mechanics had been eliminated 
from this school. Mechanical organization of the 
classroom, it seems, crushes the child’s spontaneity, 
represses his self-activity, prevents the effective opera- 
tion of the principle of self-realization. How, then, did 
these three groups exchange places, for I felt that the 
P 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  210 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
doctrine of self-realization would not permit them to 
remain in the same employment during the entire 
session. ‘‘Oh,” the principal replied, ““when they get 
ready to change, they change, that’s all.” 
I saw that a change was coming directly, so I waited 
to watch it. The group had been working with what 
I should call a great deal of noise and confusion. All 
at once this increased tenfold. Pupils jumped over 
seats, ran into each other in the aisles, scurried and 
scampered from this place to that, while the teacher 
stood in the front of the room wildly waving her arms. 
The performance lasted several minutes. ‘‘There’s 
“spontaneity for you,” the principal shouted above the 
roar of the storm. I acquiesced by a nod of the head, 
—my lungs, through lack of training, being unequal to 
the emergency. ‘ 
We passed to another room. The same group sys- 
tem was in evidence. I noticed pupils who had been 
working at their seats suddenly put away their books 
and papers and skip over to the construction table. I 
asked concerning the nature of the construction work. 
“We use it,” the principal told me, “as a reward for 
good work in the book subjects. You see arithmetic is 
dead and dry. You must give pupils an incentive to 
master it. We make the privileges of the construction 
table the incentive.” ‘‘What do they make at this 
table?” I asked. ‘Whatever their fancy dictates,” 
he replied. I was a little curious, however, to know 
   
-P-A-G-E-221
  
  THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 211 
how it all come out. ‘I saw one child start to work on 
a basket, work at it a few minutes, then take up some- 
thing else, continue a little time, go back to the basket, 
and finally throw both down for a third object of self- 
realization. I called the principal’s attention to this 
phenomenon. ‘How do you get the beautiful results 
that you exhibit?” I asked. “For those,” he said, 
“we just keep the pupils working on one thing until it 
is finished.” ‘But,’ I objected, “is that consistent 
with the doctrine of spontaneity?” His answer was 
lost in the din of a change of groups, and I did not 
follow the investigation further. 
Noon dismissal was due when I went into the corri- 
dor. Lines are forbidden in that school. At the stroke 
of the bell, the classroom doors burst open and bedlam 
was let loose. I had anticipated what was coming, and 
hurriedly betook myself to an alcove. I saw more 
spontaneity in two minutes than I had ever seen before 
in my life. Some boys tore through the corridors at 
breakneck speed and down the stairways, three steps at 
a time. Others sauntered along, realizing various pro- 
pensities by pushing and shoving each other, snatching 
caps out of others’ hands, slapping each other over the 
head with books, and various other expressions of ex- 
uberant spirits. One group stopped in front of my 
alcove, and showed commendable curiosity about the 
visitor in their midst. After exhausting his static pos- 
sibilities, they tempted him to dynamic reaction by  
-P-A-G-E-222
212 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
making faces; but this proving to be of no avail, they 
went on their way, — in the hope, doubtless, of realiz- 
ing themselves elsewhere. 
I left that school with a fairly firm conviction that I 
had seen the most advanced notions of educational 
theory worked out to a logical conclusion. There was 
nothing halfway about it. There was no apology 
offered for anything that happened. It was all fair 
and square and open and aboveboard. To be sure, 
the pupils were, to my prejudiced mind, in a condition 
approaching anarchy, but I could not deny the spon- 
taneity, nor could I deny self-activity, nor could I deny 
self-realization. These principles were evidently operat- 
ing without let or hindrance. 
Before leaving the school, I took occasion to inquire 
concerning the effect of such a system upon the teachers. 
I led up to it by asking the principal if there were any 
nervous or anemic children in his school. ‘‘Not one,” 
he replied enthusiastically; “our system eliminates 
them.” “But how about the teachers?” I ventured to 
remark, having in mind the image of a distracted young 
woman whom I had seen attempting to reduce forty 
little ruffians to some semblance of law and order through 
moral suasion. If I judged conditions correctly, that® 
woman was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. My 
guide became confidential when I made this inquiry. 
“To tell the truth,” he whispered, ‘the system is mighty 
hard on the women.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 213 
A few years ago I had the privilege of visiting a high 
school which was operated upon this same principle. 
I visited in that school some classes that were taught 
by men and women, whom I should number among the 
most expert teachers that I have ever seen. The in- 
struction that these men and women were giving was 
as clear and lucid as one could desire. And yet, in spite 
of that excellent instruction, pupils read newspapers, 
prepared other lessons, or read books during the recita- 
tions, and did all this openly and unreproved. They 
responded to their instructors with shameless insolence. 
Young ladies of sixteen and seventeen coming from 
cultured homes were permitted in this school to pull 
each other’s hair, pinch the arms of schoolmates who 
were reciting, and behave themselves in general as if 
they were savages. The pupils lolled in their seats, 
passed notes, kept up an undertone of conversation, 
arose from their seats at the first tap of the bell, and 
piled in disorder out of the classroom while the in- 
structor was still talking. If the lessons had been 
tedious, one might perhaps at least have palliated such 
conduct, but the instruction was very far from tedious. 
It was bright, lively, animated, beautifully clear,. and 
admirably illustrated. It is simply the theory of this 
school never to interfere with the spontaneous activity 
of the pupils. And I may add that the school draws 
its enrollment very largely from wealthy families who 
believe that their children are being given the best that
-P-A-G-E-224
214 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
modern education has developed, that they are not 
being subjected to the deadening methods of the aver- 
age public school, and above all that their manners 
are not being corrupted by promiscuous mingling with 
the offspring of illiterate immigrants. And yet soon 
afterward, I visited a high school in one of the poorest 
slum districts of a large city. I saw pupils well-behaved, 
courteous to one another, to their instructors, and to 
visitors. The instruction was much below that given 
in the first school in point of quality, and yet the 
pupils were getting from it, even under these conditions, 
vastly more than were the pupils of the other school 
from their masterly instructors. 
The two schools that I first described represent one 
type of the attempt that education has made to pioneer 
a new path through the wilderness. I have said that 
many of these attempts have ended by bringing the 
adventurers back to their starting point. I cannot say 
so much for these schools. The movement that they 
represent is still floundering about in the tamarack 
swamps, getting farther and farther into the morass, 
with little hope of ever emerging. 
May I tax your patience with one more concrete 
illustration: this time, of a school that seems to me to 
have reached the starting point, but on that new and 
higher plane of which I have spoken ? 
This school is in a small Massachusetts town, and is 
the model department of the state normal school located
-P-A-G-E-225
  
THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 215 
at that place. The first point that impressed me was 
typified by a boy of about twelve who was passing 
through the corridor as I entered the building. In- 
stead of slouching along, wasting every possible moment 
before he should return to his room, he was walking 
briskly as if eager to get back to his work. Instead of 
staring at the stranger within his gates with the impu- 
dent curiosity so often noticed in children of this age, 
he greeted me pleasantly and wished to know if I were 
looking for the principal. When I told him that I was, 
he informed me that the principal was on the upper 
floor, but that he would go for him at once. He did, 
and returned a moment later saying that the head of 
the school would be down directly, and asked me to 
wait in the office, into which he ushered me with all the 
courtesy of a private secretary. Then he excused him- 
self and went directly to his room. 
Now that might have been an exceptional case, but 
I found out later that is was not. ‘Wherever I went in 
that school, the pupils were polite and courteous and 
respectful. That was part of their education. It 
should be part of every child’s education. But many 
schools are too busy teaching reading, writing, and 
arithmetic, and others are too busy preserving disci- 
pline, and others are too busy coquetting for the good 
will of their pupils and trying to amuse them — too 
busy to give heed to a set of habits that are of para- 
mount importance in the life of civilized society. This  
-P-A-G-E-226
    
216 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
school took up the matter of training in good manners 
as an essential part of its duty, and it accomplished 
this task quickly and effectively. It did it by utilizing 
the opportunities presented in the usual course of 
school work. It took a little time and a little atten- 
tion, for good manners cannot be acquired incidentally 
any more than the multiplication tables can be acquired 
incidentally ; but it utilized the everyday opportunities 
of the schoolroom, and did not make morals and man- 
ners the subject of instruction for a half-hour on Friday 
afternoons to be completely forgotten during the rest of 
the week. 
When the principal took me through the school, I 
noted everywhere a happy and courteous relation be- 
tween pupils and teachers. They spoke pleasantly to 
one another. I heard no nagging or scolding. I saw 
no one sulking or pouting or in bad temper. And yet 
there was every evidence of respect and obedience on 
the part of the pupils. There was none of that happy- 
go-lucky comradeship which I have sometimes seen in 
other modern schools, and which leads the pupil to 
understand that his teacher is there to gain his interest, 
not to command his respectful attention. Pupils were 
too busy with their work to talk much with one an- 
other. They were sitting up in their seats as a matter 
of habit, and it did not seem to hurt them seriously to 
do so. And everywhere they were working like beavers 
at one task or another, or attending with all their eyes 
and ears to a recitation.
-P-A-G-E-227
‘THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 217 
Now it seemed to me that this school was operated 
with a minimum of waste or loss. Every item of energy 
that the pupils possessed was being given to some edu-. 
cative activity. Nothing was lost by conflict between 
pupil and teacher. Nothing was lost by bursts of 
anger or by fits of depression. These sources of waste 
had been eliminated so far as I could determine. The 
pupils could read well and write well and cipher accu- 
rately. They even took a keen delight in the drills. 
And I found that this phase of their work was en- 
lightened by the modern content that had been intro- 
duced. In their handwork and manual training they 
could see that arithmetic was useful, —that it had 
something to do with the great big buzzing life of the 
outer world. They learned that spelling was useful in 
writing, — that it was not something that began and 
ended within the covers of the spelling book, but that 
it had a real and vital relation to other things that 
they found to be important. They had their dramatic 
exercises in which they and their fellows, and, on occa- 
sions, their parents, took a keen delight, and they were 
glad to afford them pleasure and to receive congratula- 
tions at the close. And yet they found that, in order 
- to do these things well, they must read and study and 
drill on speaking. They liked to have their drawings 
inspected and praised at the school exhibitions, but they 
soon found that good drawing and painting and design- 
ing were strictly conditioned by a mastery of technique, 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
and they wished to master technique in order to win 
these rewards. 
Now what was the secret of the efficiency of this 
school? Not merely the fact that it had introduced 
certain types of content such as drawing, manual train- 
ing, domestic science, dramatization, story work, — 
but also that it had not lost sight of the fundamental 
purpose of elementary education, but had so organized 
all of its studies that each played into the hands of 
the others, and that everything that was done had 
some definite and tangible relation to everything else. 
The manual training exercises and the mechanical 
drawing were exercises in arithmetic, but, let me remind 
you, there were other lessons, and formal lessons, in 
arithmetic as well. But the one exercise enlightened 
and made more meaningful the other. In the same way 
the story and dramatization were intimately related to 
the reading and the language, but there were formal 
lessons in reading and formal lessons in language. The 
geography illustrated nature study and employed lan- 
guage and arithmetic and drawing in its exercises. And 
so the whole structure was organized and coherent 
and unified, and what was taught in one class was 
utilized in another. There was no needless duplication, 
no needless or meaningless repetition. But repetition 
there was, over and over again, but always it was effec- 
tive in still more firmly fixing the habits. 
Y One would be an ingrate, indeed, if one failed to  
-P-A-G-E-229
  THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 219 
recognize the great good that an extreme reform move- 
ment may do. Some very precious increments of 
progress have resulted even from the most extreme and 
ridiculous reactions against the drill and formalism of 
the older schools. Let me briefly summarize these really 
substantial gains as I conceive them. 
In the first place, we have come to recognize distinctly 
the importance of enlisting in the service of habit building 
the native instincts of the child. Up to a certain point 
nature provides for the fixing of useful responses, and we 
should be unwise not to make use of these tendencies. In 
the spontaneous activities of play, certain fundamental 
reactions are continually repeated until they reach the 
plane of absolute mechanism. In imitating the actions 
of others, adjustments are learned and made into habits 
without effort ; in fact, the process of imitation, so far as 
it is instinctive, is a source of pure delight to the young 
child. Finally, closely related to these two instincts, is 
the native tendency to repetition, —nature’s primary 
provision for drill. You have often heard little children 
repeat their new words over and over again. Frequently 
they have no conception of the meanings of these words. 
Nature seems to be untroubled by a question that has 
bothered teachers; namely, Should a child ever be 
asked to drill on something the purpose of which he 
does not understand? Nature sees to it that certain 
essential responses become automatic long before the 
child is conscious of their meaning. Just because  
-P-A-G-E-230
220 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
nature does this is, of course, no reason why we should 
imitate her. But the fact is an interesting commentary 
upon the extreme to which we sometimes carry our 
principle of rationalizing everything before permitting 
it to be mastered. 
I repeat that the reform movement has done excellent 
service in extending the recognition in education of these 
fundamental and inborn adaptive instincts, — play, imi- 
tation, and rhythmic repetition. It has erred when it 
has insisted that we could depend upon these alone, for 
nature has adapted man, not to the complicated con- 
ditions of our modern highly organized social life, but 
rather to primitive conditions. Left to themselves, these 
instinctive forces would take the child up to a certain 
point, but they would still leave him on a primitive plane. 
I know of one good authority on the teaching of reading 
who maintains that the normal child would learn to read 
without formal teaching if he were placed in the right 
environment, — an environment of books. This may be 
possible with some exceptional children, but even an 
environment reasonably replete with books does not ef- 
fect this miracle in the case of certain children whom I 
know very well and whom I like to think of as perfectly 
normal. These children learned to talk by imitation and - 
instinctive repetition. But nature has not yet gone so 
far as to provide the average child with spontaneous im- 
pulses that will lead him to learn to read. Reading is a 
much more complicated and highly organized process. 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 221 
And so it is with a vast number of the activities that our 
pupils must master. 
Another increment of progress that the reform move- 
ment has given to educational practice is a recognition of 
the fact that we have been requiring pupils to acquire 
unnecessary habits, under the impression, that even if the 
habits were not useful, something of value was gained in 
their acquisition. As a result, we have passed all of our 
grain through the same mill, unmindful of the fact that 
different life activities required different types of grist. 
To-day we are seeing the need for carefully selecting the 
types of habit and skill that should be developed in ail 
children. We are recognizing that there are many phases 
of the educative process that it is not well to reduce to an 
automatic basis. When I was in the elementary school 
I memorized Barnes’s History of the United States and 
Harper’s Geography from cover to cover. I have never 
greatly regretted this automatic mastery; but I have 
often thought that I might have memorized something 
rather more important, for history and geography could 
have been mastered just as effectively in another way. 
In the third place, and most important of all, we have 
been led to analyze this complex process of habit building, 
— to find out the factors that operate in learning. We 
have now a goodly body of principles that may even be 
characterized by the adjective “scientific.” We know 
that in habit building, it is fundamentally essential to get 
the pupil started in the right way. A recent writer states
-P-A-G-E-232
222 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
that two thirds of the difficulty that the teacher meets 
fixing habits is due to the neglect of this principle. Inad-   
equate and inefficient habits get started and must be 
continually combated while the desirable habit is being 
formed. How important this is in the initial presentation 
of material that is to be memorized or made automatic we 
are just now beginning to appreciate. One writer in- 
sists that faulty work in the first grade is responsible for 
a large part of the retardation which is bothering us so 
much to-day. The wrong kind of a start is made, and 
whenever a faulty habit is formed, it much more than 
doubles the difficulty of getting the right one well under   
      
way. We are slowly coming to appreciate how much 
time is wasted in drill processes by inadequate methods. 
Technique is being improved and the time thus saved is 
being given to the newer content subjects that are de-° 
manding admission to the schools. 
Again, we are coming to appreciate as never before the 
importance of motivating our drill work, — of not only 
reading into it purpose and meaning so that the pupil will 
understand what it is all for, but also of engendering in 
him the desire to form the habits, — to undergo the dis- 
cipline that is essential for mastery. Here again the 
reform movement has been helpful, showing us the waste 
of time and energy that results from attempting to fix 
habits that are only weakly motivated. 
All this is a vastly different matter from sugar-coating 
the drill processes, under the mistaken notion that some- 
   
-P-A-G-E-233
THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 223 
thing that is worth while may be acquired without effort. 
I think that educators are generally agreed that such a 
policy is thoroughly bad, — for it subverts a basic prin- 
ciple of human life the operation of which neither educa- 
tion nor any other force can alter or reverse. To teach 
the child that the things in life that are worth doing are 
easy to do, or that they are always or even often intrinsi- 
cally pleasant or agreeable, is to teach him a lie. Human 
history gives us no examples of worthy achievements that 
have not been made at the price of struggle and effort, — 
at the price of doing things that men did not want to do. 
Every great truth has had to struggle upward from defeat. 
Every man who has really found himself in the work of 
life has paid the price of sacrifice for his success. And 
whenever we attempt to give our pupils a mastery of the 
complicated arts and skills that have lifted civilized man 
above the plane of his savage ancestors, we must expect 
from them struggle and effort and self-denial. 
Let me quote a paragraph from the report of a recent 
investigation in the psychology of learning. The habit 
that was being learned in this experiment was skill in the 
use of the typewriter. The writer describes the process 
in the following words: 
“Tn the early stages of learning, our subjects were all very much 
interested in the work. Their whole mind seemed to be sponta- 
neously held by the writing. They were always anxious to take up 
the work anew each day. Their general attitude and the resultant 
sensations constituted a pleasant feeling tone, which had a helpful 
reactionary effect upon the work. Continued practice, however,  
-P-A-G-E-234
  224 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
brought a change. In place of the spontaneous, rapt attention of 
the beginning stages, attention tended, at certain definite stages of 
advancement, to wander away from the work. A general feeling 
of monotony, which at times assumed the form of utter disgust, 
took the place of the former pleasant sensations and feelings. 
The writing became a disagreeable task. The unpleasant feelings 
now present in consciousness exerted an ever-restraining effect on 
the work. As an expert skill was approached, however, the 
learners’ attitude and mood changed again. They again took a 
keen interest in the work. Their whole feeling tone once more 
became favorable, and the movements delightful and pleasant. 
The expert typist . . . so thoroughly enjoyed the writing that it 
was as pleasant as the spontaneous play activities of a child. But 
in the course of developing this permanent interest in the work, 
there were many periods in nearly every test, many days, as well as 
stages in the practice as a whole, when the work was much disliked, 
periods when the learning assumed the rdle of a very monotonous 
task. Our records showed that at such times as these no progress 
was made. Rapid progress in learning typewriting was made only 
when the learners were feeling good and had an attitude of interest 
toward the work.” * 
Who has not experienced that feeling of hopelessness 
and despair that comes at these successive levels of the 
long process of acquiring skill in a complicated art? 
How desperately we struggle on — striving to put every 
item of energy that we can command into our work, and 
yet feeling how hopeless it allseems. How tempting then 
is the hammock on the porch, the fascinating novel that 
we have placed on our bedside table, the happy company 
of friends that are talking and laughing in the next room; 
or how we long for the green fields and the open road;

-P-A-G-E-235
    THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 225 
how seductive is that siren call of change and diversion, 
— that evil spirit of procrastination! How feeble, too, 
are the efforts that we make under these conditions! 
We are not making progress in our art, we are only mark- 
ing time. And yet the psychologists tell us that this 
marking time is an essential in the mastery of any compli- 
cated art. Somewhere, deep down in the nervous sys- 
tem, subtle processes are at work, and when finally in- 
terest dawns, — when finally hope returns to us, and 
life again becomes worth while, — these heartbreaking 
struggles reap their reward. The psychologists call 
them “plateaus of growth,” but some one has said that 
“sloughs of despond” would be a far better desig- 
nation. 
The progress of any individual depends upon his ability 
to pass through these sloughs of despond, — to set his 
face resolutely to the task and persevere. It would be 
the idlest folly to lead children to believe that success 
or achievement or even passing ability can be gained in 
any other manner. And this is the danger in the sugar- 
coating process. 
But motivation does not mean sugar-coating. It 
means the development of purpose, of ambition, of in- 
centive. It means the development of the willingness 
to undergo the discipline in order that the purpose may be 
realized, in order that the goal may be attained. It 
means the creating of those conditions that make for 
strength and virility and moral fiber, — for it is in the 
Q
-P-A-G-E-236
  226 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
consciousness of having overcome obstacles and won 
in spite of handicaps, —it is in this consciousness of 
conquest that mental strength and moral strength have 
their source. The victory that really strengthens one is 
not the victory that has come easily, but the victory 
that stands out sharp and clear against the background 
of effort and struggle. It is because this subjective 
contrast is so absolutely essential to the consciousness of 
power, —it is for this reason that the “sloughs of de- 
spond” still have their function in our new attitude 
toward drill. 
But do not mistake me: I have no sympathy with that 
educational “ stand-pattism”’ that would multiply these 
needlessly, or fail to build solid and comfortable highways 
across them wherever it is possible to do so. I have no 
sympathy with that philosophy of education which ap- 
proves the placing of artificial barriers in the learner’s 
path. But if I build highways across the morasses, 
it is only that youth may the more readily traverse the 
region and come the more quickly to the points where 
struggle is absolutely necessary. 
You remember in George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda the 
story of Gwendolen Harleth. Gwendolen was a butterfly 
of society, a young woman in whose childhood drill and 
discipline had found no place. - In early womanhood, she 
was, through family misfortune, thrown upon her own 
resources. In casting about for some means of self- 
support her first recourse was to music, for which she had 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
   THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD DRILL 227 
some taste and in which she had had some slight training. 
She sought out her old German music teacher, Klesmer, 
and asked him what she might do to turn this taste and 
this training to financial account. Klesmer’s reply sums 
up in a nutshell the psychology of skill: 
“Any great achievement in acting or in music grows with the 
growth. Whenever an artist has been able to say, ‘I came, I saw, 
I conquered,’ it has been at the end of patient practice. Genius, 
at first, is little more than a great capacity for receiving disci- 
pline. Singing and acting, like the fine dexterity of the juggler with 
his cup and balls, require a shaping of the organs toward a finer 
and finer certainty of effect. Your muscles, your whole frame, 
must go like a watch, — true, true, true, to a hair. This is the 
work of the springtime of life before the habits have been 
formed.” 
And I can formulate my own conception of the work of 
habit building in education no better than by paraphras- 
ing Klesmer’s epigram. To increase in our pupils the 
capacity to receive discipline; to show them, through 
concrete example, over and over again, how persistence 
and effort and concentration bring results that are 
worth while; to choose from their own childish experi- 
ences the illustrations that will force this lesson home; 
to supplement, from the stories of great achievements, 
those illustrations which will inspire them to effort; 
to lead them to see that Peary conquering the Pole, 
or Wilbur Wright perfecting the aéroplane, or Morse 
struggling through long years of' hopelessness and dis- 
couragement to give the world the electric telegraph, —
-P-A-G-E-238
  228 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
to show them that these men went through experiences 
differing only in degree and not in kind from those which 
characterize every achievement, no matter how small, so 
long as it is dominated by a unitary purpose; to make 
the inevitable sloughs of despond no less morasses, per- 
haps, but to make their conquest add a permanent incre- 
ment to growth and development :. this is the task of our 
drill work as I view it. As the prophecy of Isaiah has it : 
“Precept must be upon precept; precept upon precept ; 
line upon line; line upon line; here a little and there a 
little.” And if we can succeed in giving our pupils this 
vision, — if we can reveal the deeper meaning of struggle 
and effort and self-denial and sacrifice shining out 
through the little details of the day’s work, — we are our- 
selves achieving something that is richly worth while; 
for the highest triumph of the teacher’s art is to get his 
pupils to see, in the small and seemingly trivial affairs of 
everyday life, the operation of fundamental and eternal 
principles.

Tue Iprat TEACHER! 
I wisu to discuss with you briefly a very commonplace 
and oft-repeated theme, —a theme that has been han- 
dled and handled until its once-glorious raiment is now 
quite threadbare; a theme so full of pitfalls and dangers 
for one who would attempt its discussion that I have hesi- 
tated long before making a choice. I know of no other 
theme that lends itself so readily to a superficial treatment 
—of no theme upon which one could find so easily at 
hand all of the proverbs and platitudes and maxims that 
one might desire. And so I cannot be expected to say 
anything upon this topic that has not been said before in 
a far better manner. But, after all, very few of our 
thoughts — even of those that we consider to be the 
most original and worth while — are really new to the 
world. Most of our thoughts have been thought 
before. They are like dolls that-are passed on from age to 
age to be dressed up and decorated-to suit the taste or the 
fashion or the fancy of each succeeding generation. But 
even a new dress may add a touch of newness to an old

doll; and a new phrase or a new setting may, for a 
moment, rejuvenate an old truth. 
The topic that I wish to treat is this, “The Ideal 
Teacher.” And I may as well start out by saying that 
the ideal teacher is and always must be a figment of the 
imagination. This is the essential feature of any ideal. 
The ideal man, for example, must possess an infinite num- 
ber of superlative characteristics. We take this virtue 
from one, and that from another, and so on indefinitely 
until we have constructed in imagination a paragon, the 
counterpart of which could never exist on earth. He 
would have all the virtues of all the heroes; but he would 
lack all their defects and all their inadequacies. He 
would have the manners of a Chesterfield, the courage 
of a Winkelried, the imagination of a Dante, the eloquence 
of a Cicero, the wit of a Voltaire, the intuitions of a Shake- 
speare, the magnetism of a Napoleon, the patriotism of a 
Washington, the loyalty of a Bismarck, the humanity of 
a Lincoln, and a hundred other qualities, each the counter- 
part of some superlative quality, drawn from the historic 
figure that represented that quality in richest measure. 
And so it is with the ideal teacher: he would combine, 
in the right proportion, all of the good qualities of all of 
the good teachers that we have ever known or heard of. 
The ideal teacher is and always must be a creature, not 
of flesh and blood, but of the imagination, a child of the 
brain. And perhaps it is well that this is true; for, 
if he existed in the flesh, it would not take very many of
-P-A-G-E-241
THE IDEAL TEACHER 231 
him to put the rest of us out of business. The relentless 
law of compensation, which rules that unusual growth in 
one direction must always be counterbalanced by defi- 
cient growth in another direction, is the saving principle 
of human society. That a man should be superlatively 
good in one single line of effort is the demand of modern 
life. It is a platitude to say that this is the age of the 
specialist. But specialism, while it always means a gain 
to society, also always means a loss to the individual. 
Darwin, at the age of forty, suddenly awoke to the fact 
that he was a man of one idea. Twenty years before, he 
had been a youth of the most varied and diverse interests. 
He had enjoyed music, he had found delight in the 
masterpieces of imaginative literature, he had felt a keen 
interest in the drama, in poetry, in the fine arts. But 
at forty Darwin quite by accident discovered that these 
things had not attracted him for years, — that every 
increment of his time and energy was concentrated in a 
constantly increasing measure upon the unraveling of 
that great problem to which he had set himself. And he 
lamented bitterly the loss of these other interests; he 
wondered why he had been so thoughtless as to let them 
. slip from his grasp. It was the same old story of human 
progress; the sacrifice of the individual to the race. For 
Darwin’s loss was the world’s gain, and if he had not 
limited himself to one line of effort, and given himself 
up to that work to the exclusion of everything else, the 
world might still be waiting for the Origin of Species, and 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
    232 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
the revolution in human thought and human life which 
followed in the wake of that great book. Carlyle defined 
genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. George 
Eliot characterized it as an infinite capacity for receiving 
discipline. But to make the definition complete, we need 
the formulation of Goethe, who identified genius with the 
power of concentration: ‘‘Who would be great must 
limit his ambitions; in concentration is shown the 
Master.” 
And so the great men of history, from the very fact of 
their genius, are apt not to correspond with what our 
ideal of greatness demands. Indeed, our ideal is often 
more nearly realized in men who fall far short of genius. 
When I studied chemistry, the instructor burned a bit of 
diamond to prove to us that the diamond was, after all, 
only carbon in an “‘allotropic” form. There seems to be 
a similar allotropy working in human nature. Some men 
seem to have all the constituents of genius, but they 
never reach very far above the plane of the commonplace. 
They are like the diamond, — except that they are more 
like the charcoal. 
I wish to describe to you a teacher who was not a genius, 
and yet who possessed certain qualities that I should 
abstract and appropriate if I were to construct in my 
imagination an ideal teacher. I first met this man five 
years ago out in the mountain country. I can recall 
the occasion with the most vivid distinctness. It was a 
sparkling morning, in middle May. The valley was just
-P-A-G-E-243
  THE IDEAL TEACHER 233 
beginning to green a little under the influence of the 
lengthening days, but on the surrounding mountains the 
snow line still hung low. I had just settled down to my 
morning’s work when word was brought that a visitor 
wished to see me, and a moment later he was shown into 
the office. He was tall and straight, with square shoul- 
ders and a deep chest. His hair was gray, and a rather 
long white beard added to the effect of age, but detracted 
not an iota from the evidences of strength and vigor. 
He had the look of a Westerner, — of a man who had 
lived much of his life in the open. There was a rugged- 
ness about him, a sturdy strength that told of many a 
day’s toil along the trail, and many a night’s sleep under 
the stars. 
In a few words he stated the purpose of his visit. He 
simply wished to do what half a hundred others in the 
course of the year had entered that office for the purpose 
of doing. He wished to enroll as a student in the college 
and to prepare himself for a teacher. This was not ordi- 
narily a startling request, but hitherto it had been made 
only by those who were just starting out on the highroad 
of life. Here was a man advanced in years. He told 
me that he was sixty-five, and sixty-five in that country 
meant old age; for the region had but recently been 
settled, and most of the people were either young or 
middle-aged. The only old men in the country were the 
few surviving pioneers, — men who had come in away 
back in the early days of the mining fever, long before
-P-A-G-E-244
234 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
the advent of the railroad. They had trekked across the 
plains from Omaha, and up through the mountainous 
passes of the Oregon trail; or, a little later, they had come 
by steamboat from St. Louis up the twelve-hundred-mile 
stretch of the Missouri until their progress had been 
stopped by the Great Falls in the very foothills of the 
Rockies. What heroes were these graybeards of the 
mountains! What possibilities in knowing them, of lis- 
tening to the recounting of tales of the early days, —of 
running fights with the Indians on the plains, of ambush- 
ments by desperadoes in the mountain passes, of the lurid 
life of the early mining camps, and the desperate deeds 
of the Vigilantes! And here, before me, was a man of 
that type. You could read the main facts of his history 
in the very lines of his face. And this man — one of 
that small band whom the whole country united to 
honor — this man wanted to become a student, — to sit 
among adolescent boys and girls, listening to the lectures 
and discussions of instructors who were babes in arms 
when he was a man of middle life. 
But there was no doubt of his determination. With 
the eagerness of a boy, he outlined his plan to me; and in 
doing this, he told me the story of his life, — just the 
barest facts to let me know that he was not a man to do 
things half-heartedly, or to drop a project until he had 
carried it through either to a successful issue, or to indis- 
putable defeat. 
And what a life that man had lived! He had been a
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE IDEAL TEACHER 235 
youth of promise, keen of intelligence and quick of wit. 
He had spent two years at a college in the Middle West 
back in the early sixties. He had left his course uncom- 
pleted to enter the army, and he had followed the fortunes 
of war through the latter part of the great rebellion. At 
the close of the war he went West. He farmed in Kan- 
sas until the drought and the grasshoppers urged him 
on. He joined the first surveying party that picked out 
the line of the transcontinental railroad that was to 
follow the southern route along the old Santa Fé trail. 
He carried the chain and worked the transit across the 
Rockies, across the desert, across the Sierras, until, with 
his companions, he had — 
“Ted the iron stallions down to drink , 
Through the cafions to the waters of the West.” 
And when this task was accomplished, he followed the 
lure of the gold through the California placers; eastward 
again over the mountains to the booming Nevada camp, 
where the Comstock lode was already turning out the 
wealth that was to build a half-dozen colossal fortunes. 
He “prospected” through this country, with varying 
success, living the life of the camps, — rich in its experi- 
ences, vivid in its coloring, calling forth every item of 
energy and courage and hardihood that a man could 
command. Then word came by that mysterious wireless 
and keyless telegraphy of the mountains and the desert, 
— word that back to the eastward, ore deposits of untold
-P-A-G-E-246
  236 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
wealth had been discovered. So eastward once more, 
with the stampede of the miners, he turned his face. 
He was successful at the outset in this new region. He 
quickly accumulated a fortune; he lost it and amassed 
another; lost that and still gained a third. Five suc- 
cessive fortunes he made successively, and successively 
he lost them. But during this time he had become a 
man of power and influence in the community. He 
married and raised a family and saw his children com- 
fortably settled. 
But when his last fortune was swept away, the old 
Wanderlust again claimed its own. Houses and lands and 
mortgages and mills and mines had slipped from his grasp. 
But it mattered little. He had only himself to care for, 
and, with pick and pan strapped to his saddlebow, he set 
his face westward. Along the ridges of the high Rockies, 
through Wyoming and Montana, he wandered, ever on 
the lookout for the glint of gold in the white quartz. 
Little by little he moved westward, picking up a sufficient 
living, until he found himself one winter shut in by the 
snows in a remote valley on the upper waters of the Galla- 
tin River. He stopped one night at a lonely ranch house. 
In the course of the evening his host told him of a catas- 
trophe that had befallen the widely scattered inhabitants 
of that remote valley. The teacher of the district school 
had fallen sick, and there was little likelihood of their 
getting another until spring. 
That is a true catastrophe to the ranchers of the high
-P-A-G-E-247
THE IDEAL TEACHER 237 
valleys cut off from every line of communication with the 
outer world. For the opportunities of education are 
highly valued in that part of the West. They are 
reckoned with bread and horses and cattle and sheep, 
as among the necessities of life. The children were 
crying for school, and their parents could not satisfy 
that peculiar kind of hunger. But here was the relief. 
This wanderer who had arrived in their midst was a 
man of parts. He was lettered; he was educated. 
Would he do them the favor of teaching their children 
until the snow had melted away from the ridges, and his 
cayuse could pick the trail through the cafions ? 
Now school-keeping was farthest from this man’s 
thoughts. But the needs of little children were very 
near to his heart. He accepted the offer, and entered 
the log schoolhouse as the district schoolmaster, while a 
handful of pupils, numbering all the children of the com- 
munity who could ride a broncho, came five, ten, and 
even fifteen miles daily, through the winter’s snows and 
storms and cruel cold, to pick up the crumbs of learning 
that had lain so long untouched. 
What happened in that lonely little school, far off on 
the Gallatin bench, I never rightly discovered. But when 
spring opened up, the master sold his cayuse and his pick 
and his rifle and the other implements of his trade. With 
the earnings of the winter he made his way to the school 
that the state had established for the training of teachers ; 
and I count it as one of the privileges of my life that I
-P-A-G-E-248
2, 38 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
was the first official of that school to listen to his story and 
to welcome him to the vocation that he had chosen to 
follow. 
And yet, when I looked at his face, drawn into lines of 
strength by years of battle with the elements; when I 
looked at the clear, blue eyes, that told of a far cleaner 
life than is lived by one in a thousand of those that hold 
the frontiers of civilization; when I caught an expression 
about the mouth that told of an innate humanity far 
beyond the power of worldly losses or misfortunes to 
crush and subdue, I could not keep from my lips the words 
that gave substance to my thought ; and the thought was 
this: that it were far better if we who were supposed to 
be competent to the task of education should sit rever- 
ently at the feet of this man, than that we should presume 
to instruct him. For knowledge may come from books, 
and even youth may possess it, but wisdom comes only 
from experience, and this man had that wisdom in far 
greater measure than we of books and laboratories and 
classrooms could ever hope to have it. He had lived 
years while we were living days. 
I thought of a learned scholar who, through patient 
labor in amassing facts, had demonstrated the influence 
of the frontier in the development of our national ideals ; 
who had pointed out how, at each successive stage of 
American history, the heroes of the frontier, pushing 
farther and farther into the wilderness, conquering first 
the low coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard, then the
-P-A-G-E-249
  THE IDEAL TEACHER 239 
forested foothills and ridges of the Appalachians, had 
finally penetrated into the Mississippi Valley, and, sub- 
duing that, had followed on westward to the prairies, 
and then to the great plains, and then clear across the 
great divide, the alkali deserts, and the Sierras, to Cali- 
fornia and the Pacific Coast; how these frontiersmen, 
at every stage of our history, had sent back wave after 
wave of strength and virility to keep alive the sturdy 
ideals of toil and effort and independence, — ideals that 
would counteract the mellowing and softening and de- 
generating influences of the hothouse civilization that 
grew up so rapidly in the successive regions that they 
left behind. Turner’s theory that most of what is typ- 
ical and unique in American institutions and ideals owes 
its existence to the backset of the frontier life found a 
living exemplar in the man who stood before me on that. 
May morning. 
But he would not be discouraged from his purpose. 
He had made up his mind to complete the course that the 
school offered; to take up the thread of his education at 
the point where he had dropped it more than forty years 
before. He had made up his mind, and it was easy to see 
that he was not a man to be deterred from a set purpose. 
I shall not hide the fact that some of us were skeptical 
of the outcome. That a man of sixty-five should have 
a thirst for learning was not remarkable. But that a man 
whose life had been spent in scenes of excitement, who 
had been associated with deeds and events that stir 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
240 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
the blood when we read of them to-day, a man who had 
lived almost every moment of his life in the open, — that 
such a man could settle down to the uneventful life of a 
student and a teacher, could shut himself up within the 
four walls of a classroom, could find anything to inspire 
and hold him in the dull presentation of facts or the dry 
elucidation of theories, — this seemed to be a miracle 
not to be expected in this realistic age. But, miracle or 
not, the thing actually happened. He remained nearly 
four years in the school, earning his living by work that 
he did in the intervals of study, and doing it so well that, 
when he graduated, he had not only his education and the 
diploma which stood for it, but also a bank account. 
He lived in a little cabin by himself, for he wished to 
be where he would not disturb others when he sang or 
whistled over his work in the small hours of the night. 
But his meals he took at the college dormitory, where he 
presided at a table of young women students. Never 
was a man more popular with the ladies than this weather- 
beaten patriarch with the girls of his table. No matter 
how gloomy the day might be, one could always find 
sunshine from that quarter. No matter how grievous the 
troubles of work, there was always a bit of cheerful opti- 
mism from a man who had tasted almost every joy and 
sorrow that life had to offer. If one were in a blue funk 
of dejection because of failure in a class, he would lend the 
sympathy that came from his own rich experience in 
failures, — not only past but present, for some things that

come easy at sixteen come hard at sixty-five, and this man 
who would accept no favors had to fight his way through 
“‘flunks” and “‘goose-eggs” like the younger members of 
the class. And even with it all so complete an embodi- 
ment of hope and courage and wholesome light-hearted- 
ness would be hard to find. He was an optimist because 
he had learned long since that anything but optimism 
is a crime; and learning this in early life, optimism had 
become a deeply seated and ineradicable prejudice in his 
mind. He could not have been gloomy if he had tried. 
And so this man fought his way through science and 
mathematics and philosophy, slowly but surely, just as 
he had fought inch by inch and link by link, across the 
Arizona desert years before. It was a much harder fight, 
for all the force of lifelong habit, than which there is none 
other so powerful, was against him from the start. And 
now came the human temptation to be off on the old trail, 
to saddle his horse and get a pick and a pan and make off 
across the western range to the golden land that always 
lies just under the sunset. How often that turbulent 
Wanderlust seized him, I can only conjecture. But I 
know the spirit of the wanderer was always strong within 
him. He could say, with Kipling’s Tramp Royal: 
“Tt’s like a book, I think, this bloomin’ world, 
Which you can read and care for just so long, 
But presently you feel that you will die 
Unless you get the page you’re reading done, 
An’ turn another — likely not so good; 
But what you’re after is to turn them all.”

~ 
And I knew that he fought that temptation over and 
over again; for that little experience out on the Gallatin 
bench had only partially turned his life from the channels 
of wandering, although it had bereft him of the old desire 
to seek for gold. Often he outlined to me a well-for- 
mulated plan; perhaps he had to tell some one, lest the 
fever should take too strong a hold upon him, and 
force his surrender. His plan was this: He would teach 
a term here and there, gradually working his way west- 
ward, always toward the remote corners of the earth 
into which his roving instinct seemed unerringly to lead 
him. Alaska, Hawaii, and the Philippines seemed easy 
enough to access; surely, he thought, teachers must 
be needed in all those regions. And when he should 
have turned these pages, he might have mastered his 
vocation in a degree sufficient to warrant his attempting 
an alien soil. Then he would sail away into the South 
Seas, with New Zealand and Australia as a base. And 
gradually moving westward through English-speaking 
settlements and colonies he would finally complete the 
circuit of the globe. 
And the full fruition of that plan might have formed 
a fitting climax to my tale, were I telling it for the sake 
of its romance; but my purpose demands a different con- 
clusion. My hero is now principal of schools in a little 
city of the mountains, —a city so tiny that its name 
would be unknown to most of you. And I have heard 
vague rumors that he is rising rapidly in his profession and
-P-A-G-E-253
    THE IDEAL TEACHER 243 
that the community he serves will not listen to anything 
but a permanent tenure of his office. All of which seems 
to indicate to me that he has abandoned, for the while at 
least, his intention to turn quite all the pages of the 
world’s great book, and is content to live true to the ideal 
that was born in the log schoolhouse — the conviction 
that the true life is the life of service, and that the love 
of wandering and the lure of gold are only siren calls 
that lead one always toward, but never to, the promised 
land of dreams that seems to lie just over the western 
range where the pink sunset stands sharp against the 
purple shadows. 
The ending of my story is prosaic, but everything in 
this world is prosaic, unless you view it either in the per- 
spective of time or space, or in the contrasts that bring 
out the high lights and deepen the shadows. 
But if I have left my hero happily married to his pro- 
fession, the courtship and winning of which formed the 
theme of my tale, I may be permitted to indulge in a very 
little moralizing of a rather more explicit sort than I have 
yet attempted. 
It is a simple matter to construct in imagination an 
ideal teacher. Mix with immortal youth and abounding 
health, a maximal degree of knowledge and a maximal 
-degree of experience, add perfect tact, the spirit of true 
service, the most perfect patience, and the most steadfast 
persistence; place in the crucible of some good normal 
school; stir in twenty weeks of standard psychology, 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  244 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
ten weeks of general method, and varying amounts of pat- 
ent compounds known as special methods, all warranted 
pure and without drugs or poison; sweeten with a little 
music, toughen with fifteen weeks of logic, bring to a slow 
boil in the practice school, and, while still sizzling, turn 
loose on a cold world. The formula is simple and com- 
plete, but like many another good recipe, a competent 
cook might find it hard to follow when she is short of 
butter and must shamefully skimp on the eggs. 
Now the man whose history I have recounted repre- 
sents the most priceless qualities of this formula. In the 
first place he possessed that quality the key to which the 
philosophers of all ages have sought in vain, — he had 
solved the problem of eternal youth. At the age of sixty- 
five his enthusiasm was the enthusiasm of an adolescent. 
His energy was the energy of an adolescent. Despite 
his gray hair and white beard, his mind was perennially 
young. And that is the only type of mind that ought 
to be concerned with the work of education. I sometimes 
think that one of the advantages of a practice school lies 
in the fact that the teachers who have direct charge of 
the pupils — whatever may be their limitations — have 
at least the virtue of youth, the virtue of being young. 
If they could only learn from my hero the art of keep- 
ing young, of keeping the mind fresh and vigorous and 
open to whatever is good and true, no matter how novel 
a form it may take, they might, like him, preserve their 
youth indefinitely. And I think that his life gives us
-P-A-G-E-255
THE IDEAL TEACHER 245 
one clew to the secret, — to keep as close as we can to 
nature, for nature is always young ; to sing and to whistle 
when we would rather weep; to cheer and comfort 
when we would rather crush and dishearten; often to 
dare something just for the sake of daring, for to be young 
is to dare; and always to wonder, for that is the prime 
symptom of youth, and when a man ceases to wonder, 
age and decrepitude are waiting for him around the next 
corner. 
It is the privilege of the teaching craft to represent 
more adequately than any other calling the conditions 
for remaining young. ‘There is time for living out- 
of-doors, which some of us, alas! do not do. And 
youth, with its high hope and lofty ambition, with its 
resolute daring and its naive wonder, surrounds us on 
every side. And yet how rapidly some of us age! How 
quickly life seems to lose its zest! How completely are 
we blind to the opportunities that are on every hand ! 
And closely related to this virtue of being always young, 
in fact growing out of it, the ideal teacher will have, as 
my hero had, the gift of gladness, — that joy of living 
which takes life for granted and proposes to make the 
most of every moment of consciousness that it brings. 
And finally, to balance these qualities, to keep them in 
leash, the ideal teacher should possess that spirit of serv- 
ice, that conviction that the life of service is the only life 
worth while — that conviction for which my hero strug- 
gled so long and against such tremendous odds. The
-P-A-G-E-256
246 CRAFTSMANSHIP IN TEACHING 
paint Lor service must always be the cornerstone of the 
teaching craft. To know that any life which does not 
provide the opportunities for service is not worth the 
living, and that any life, however humble, that does 
provide these opportunities is rich beyond the reach of 
earthly rewards, — this is the first lesson that the tyro 
in schoolcraft must learn, be he sixteen or sixty-five. 
And just as youth and hope and the gift of gladness are 
the eternal verities on one side of the picture, so the spirit 
of service, the spirit of sacrifice, is the eternal verity that 
forms their true complement ; without whose compensa- 
tion, hope were but idle dreaming, and laughter a hollow 
mockery. And self-denial, which is the keynote of serv- 
ice, is the great sobering, justifying, eternal factor that 
symbolizes humanity more perfectly than anything else. 
In the introduction to Romola, George Eliot pictures a 
spirit of the past who returns to earth four hundred 
years after his death, and looks down upon his native city 
of Florence. And I can conclude with no better words 
than those in which George Eliot voices her advice to 
that shade: 
“Go not down, good Spirit: for the changes are great and the 
speech of the Florentines would sound as a riddle in your ears. Or, 
if you go, mingle with no politicians on the marmi, or elsewhere; 
ask no questions about trade in Calimara; confuse yourself with no 
inquiries into scholarship, official or monastic. Only look at the 
sunlight and shadows on the grand walls that were built solidly 
and have endured in their grandeur; look at the faces of the little 
children, making another sunlight amid the shadows of age ; look, if 
you will, into the churches and hear the same chants, see the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
THE IDEAL TEACHER 247 
images as of old — the images of willing anguish for a great end, of 
beneficent love and ascending glory, see upturned living faces, and 
lips moving to the old prayers for help. These things have not 
changed. The sunlight and the shadows bring their old beauty and 
waken the old heart-strains at morning, noon, and even-tide; 
the little children are still the symbol of the eternal marriage be- 
tween love and duty; and men still yearn for the reign of peace and 
righteousness — still own that life to be the best which is a con- 
scious voluntary sacrifice.”

Classroom Management : 
Its Principles and Technique 
Cloth, xvit + 332 pages, $1.25 net 
This book considers the problems that are consequent upon the massing 
of children together for purposes of instruction and training. It aims to 
discover how the unit-group of the school system — the “ class ”— can be 
most effectively handled. The topics commonly included in treatises upon 
school management receive adequate attention; the first day of school; 
the mechanizing of routine; the daily programme; discipline and pun- 
ishment; absence and tardiness, etc. In addition to these, however, a 
number of subjects hitherto neglected in books of this class are presented ; 
the “Batavia system” of class-individual instruction; different plans for 
testing the efficiency of teaching; a new treatment of incentives based 
upon modern psychology, and a formulation of the generally accepted 
principles of professional ethics as applied to schoolcraft. Appendices 
include plates showing the quality of work that can be expected from 
pupils of different grades and syllabi of topics and questions for the use of 
“observation” classes. 
The Educative Process 
The book aims to prevent a waste of energy on the part of the young 
teacher by setting forth a systematic and comprehensive view of the task 
that is to be accomplished by the school, with the working principles for 
the attainment of the end. The best idea for the author's plan of treat- 
ment can be had from his division of the book. Part I discusses the 
function of education and of the school in biological and sociological 
terms. Part II continues the same topic from the psychological stand- 
point, Part III deals with the functioning of experience in its relation to 
the educative process. Part IV treats of the relation of education to the 
three periods of child-development: the transitional, the formative, the 
adolescent, Part V considers educational values and the necessity of 
ideals in the educative process, and Part VI concludes with the technique 
of teaching,

The need of such work is evidenced: By the great mass of varied educational 
literature showing an equal range in educational practice and theory; by 
the growing importance of the school as a social institution, and the fuller 
recognition of education as a social process; and by the great increase in 
the number of teachers and the instability of tenure which at the same 
time marks the profession. 
The men who need it are: All teachers, professional men, editors, ministers, 
legislators, all public men who deal with large questions of public welfare 
intimately connected with education — every one who appreciates the value 
of a reference work which will give him the outlines of any educational 
problem, the suggested solutions, the statistical information, and in general

A connected series of discussions on the foundations of education in the 
related sciences of biology, physiology, sociology, and philosophy, and a thoroughgoing interpretation of the nature, place, and meaning of educa- 
tion in our world. The newest points of view in the realms of natural and 
mental science are applied to the understanding of educational problems.

The Psychological Principles of Education 
By HERMAN HARRELL HORNE, Pu.D. 
Cloth, 12mo, xiii + 435 pages, $1.75 net 
The relationship of this book to the author's “ Philosophy of Education” is 
that, whereas the first was mostly theory with some practice, this is mostly 
practice with some theory. This volume lays the scientific foundations for 
the art of teaching so far as those foundations are concerned with psychol- 
ogy. The author is.the “middleman” between the psychologist and the teacher, taking the theoretical descriptions of pure psychology and trans- 
forming them into educational principles for the teacher. In the Intro- duction the reader gets his bearings in the field of the science of 
education. The remainder of the book sketches this science from the 
standpoint of psychology, the four parts of the work, Intellectual Educa- 
tion, Emotional Education, Moral Education, and Religious Education, 
being suggested by the nature of man, the subject of education. A special 
feature is the attention paid to the education of the emotions and of the will.

METHODS IN TEACHING 
Being the Stockton Methods in Elementary Schools. By Mrs. RosA 
V. WINTERBURN, of Los Angeles, and JAMEs A. Barr, Superin- 
tendent of Schools at Stockton, Cal. 12mo. Cloth, xii + 355 pages. 
$1.25 net. 
This book is a direct product of the schoolroom. It treats the 
presentation of subject-matter in the various studies usually taught 
in elementary schools from three points of view — that of the super- 
intendent or supervisor, of the teacher, and of the pupil. The book 
grew out of the exhibit made by the Stockton schools at the Expo- 
sition in St. Louis, and later in Portland, which attracted widespread 
attention because of the honesty of the pupils’ work, the “ method 
sheets” by teachers, and the efficiency of results. Many composi- 
tions by young pupils trained under this method are given.

This is practically a condensation of Professor Monroe’s “ Text- 
book in the History of Education,” issued more than two years ago, 
and still the most extensive work on the subject in English. The 
present abbreviation has been made in answer to the demands of 
normal schools and teachers’ training classes which have not the 
time to devote to the study of the larger text. Nevertheless it treats 
of all the general periods, and of most of the topics discussed in the 
larger work.

DYNAMIC FACTORS IN EDUCATION 
By M. V. O’SHEA, Professor of the Science and Art of Education, Univer: 
sity of Wisconsin. Cloth. 12mo. xiii+ 320 pages. $1.25 met. 
This volume is the result of the author’s conviction that the motor 
and physical factors should receive more attention than they now do 
in most cases. In the first part he shows that in the early years, at 
any rate, motor expression is essential to all learning, and he has 
indicated how the requirements of dynamic education can be pro- 
vided for in all departments of school work. Attention is paid also 
to the definite order in which the motor powers develop. The 
second part of the book treats the relation between fatigue and 
activity. On the one side the nature and causes of fatigue are dis- 
cussed and then the effects upon mind and body are traced. Much 
space is given to pointing out ways and means of carrying on the 
work of the schoolroom without overtaxing the pupil. Dr. O’Shea 
has summarized the investigations made upon the different topics 
discussed by specialists and has added his own observations made 
upon children whose development he has followed in detail fora 
number of years. Topics for investigation and discussion designed 
to encourage the reader to make practical tests and applications of 
the principles developed are added to each chapter. 
LINGUISTIC DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION 
By M. V. O'SHEA. 12mo. Cloth. xvii+347 pages. $1.25 nev. 
A study of the psychology of linguistic development derived from 
observation of children from the beginning of expressive activity 
until mastery of the mother tongue in its vocal and auditory forms 
has been acquired. The history and methods of these observations, 
and the deductions made in reference to linguistic functions, form 
the substance of a volume which will have great interest for all 
students both of language and of mental development.

  PREFACE 
In the preface to the fifth volume we stated that we hoped to 
show, in the next number, how the World War influenced class 
room work and activities in our school. After the signing of the 
armistice, we found ourselves looking at the war-time influences in 
the school life with a critical eye, trying to select for publication 
only those which had some more than temporary meaning, some 
lasting value in education. This fresh centering of our interest has 
brought within the scope of the present volume certain war-time 
experiences, but also many other experiences illustrating the general 
idea of free adaptation of the curriculum to social and individual 
needs. Recognition of a principle as basic as this causes a school to 
reach out in its life to touch certain great emergencies and tendencies 
of society. On the other hand, it causes each teacher intensively 
to analyze his teaching, in order to make it a genuine and helpful 
experience for each child. 
It is the object of education to train children in sociai living. It 
is.the problem of schools to choose and present subject matter and 
to arrange a program which shall so train every child. Colonel 
Parker, in Talks on Pedagogics, discusses the selection of teaching 
material. “But knowledge is boundless, and your pupils can get but 
a drop of the ocean. What knowledge can you present them in the 
years you have them under your care and guidance? What rule 
shall. govern you in the selection? The answer is not far to seek: 
your selections can be entirely governed by what each pupil needs 
for his personal development. He needs that knowledge which will 
enable him to best serve his school and the world. The two answers 
are one: The needs of the school and the needs of the world are 
the needs of the individual.” 
In speaking of the needs of the modern world, Dr. Dewey says 
that a democratic society “must have a type of education which. 
gives individuals a personal interest in social relationships and 
control, and the habits of mind which secure social changes without 
introducing disorder.” : 
The object of this volume is to suggést that the aims here 
defined can best! be realized by having a schedule flexible enough 
to meet special and individual needs, and a curriculum adapted to the 
demands of each child’s mind and spirit.

INDIVIDUAL PROJECT METHOD 
An Example of Its Operation in a Seventh Grade 
At the outset let me distinguish between two types of more or 
less “free work,” both in general parlance going under the title of 
“projects.” One may be exemplified by a class or group under 
somebody’s leadership deciding to make a scrap book illustrating 
by newspaper clippings the French aviator’s proposed world flight. 
The other type may be illustrated by a boy saying to the teacher, 
“T have a toy wireless set at home; I’d like to bring it to school and 
set it up and study about it and show the class how it works—find 
out who invented it, and so on.” We might consider the first 
example a “group project.” It is, I should say, what we meant a 
few years ago when we talked of “motivated work.” It contemplates 
the co-operation of several people, perhaps of a whole class. The 
- initiating and carrying out demand a leader or director of impor- 
tance, probably a teacher. Its virtue lies in the interest which the 
scheme arouses in the pupils and in the necessary amount of social 
co-operation. The second example is of a type of work much newer 
in the schools. It demands the working of one pupil, or possibly of 
a very small, self-chosen group. The workers are self-directed. It 
is of this second type of activity, “the individual project,” that I 
wish to speak. 
PURPOSES 
A small number of teachers scattered over the country are 
experimenting with it. They all, doubtless, look to Dr. Kilpatrick 
of Teachers’ College and to Dr. Colin Scott of the Boston Normal 
School as the developers and promulgators of the philosophy. For 
a philosophy it is—an idea that stimulates thought and action, not 
a method to be copied. Every one who falls under its spell sets 
about forming his own purposes and devising his own scheme of 
action. In an attempt through three years to act under the inspira- 
tion of the theory I have felt myself actuated by the following aims: 
to increase intensity of individual action; to preserve individual 
differences ; to train the power of choice; to train the habits of self- 
direction and of self-stimulation; to train the power of self-judg- 
ment; to stimulate the habit of putting one’s powers at the service 
of others. /
-P-A-G-E-7
6 Francis W. Parker SCHOOL 
Let me elaborate these aims a very little. 
1. Yo Increase Intensity of Individual Action —lIs it not true 
that most people work for the greater part of the time at low speed 
and that there are always frequent lapses of effort when the mind 
wanders and time is wasted? I should like to bring it about that 
_my pupils work harder than they have ever worked before, that 
the times of concentrated effort be longer and more frequent than 
is usual, that the children have the conscious intention of applying 
themselves concentratédly and intensely. 
2. To Preserve Individual Differences—-There were thirty- 
three people in the class described, with different homes, different 
parents, different inheritances. They had various characters, inter- 
ests, and abilities. I should have liked to preserve the interesting 
and valuable among these differences. I should’have liked to have 
these children remain, not thirty-three copies of one person, but 
a variety of persons; for a world of diversity is a more interesting, 
more powerful, more effective world than one in which we might 
all be alike. If we want originality in the future, we cannot get ~ 
it by training in’ conformity during the twelve most impressionable 
years. 
3. To Train the Power of Choice —Is it not true that only in 
so far as we are able individually to make morc or less independent 
personal choice are we useful to the world? People who always 
wait to follow a leader, always wait for suggestion, are a clog on 
the wheels. Again, if what we want in the people of the future is 
the power of choosing, we teachers must not through twelve years 
be making the choices. 
4. To Train the Habits of Self-Direction and of Self-Stimula- 
tion.—In business and industry that nian is a nuisance who, after 
he has been given a job to do, is always referring to his superior 
for directions as to how to do it and where to find the material, 
and for decision as to whether he is right as far as he has gone. 
‘He soon has to give place to a man who can take up a job, make 
sure of its purposes and of the limiting conditions, and then relieve 
his superior of all worry over it until it is done. Are we training 
our children for this kind of self-direction? 
5. To Train the Power of Self-Judgment—We ought to learn 
from every experience. “We fall to rise, are baffled to fight better.” 
But how is this possible except as we learn to judge the success 
and failure, the value, of what we do? Few of us, perhaps, feel
-P-A-G-E-8
Srupies In EpucaTIon: 7 
any confidence in our own judgment of anything, our own tastes, 
our own efforts least of all. Therefore we accept the loudest opinion 
of neighbors or platform or press. Why? Does the answer lie in 
the fact that for eight or twelve or sixteen years we have been 
trying to live according to someone else’s judgment and have been 
secking to gain the symbol of his favorable opinion? 
6. To Stimulate the Habit of Putting One’s Power at the 
Service of Others—Of late the educational world has been talking 
much of the “socialized recitation.” This means, does it not, that 
we believe the chief purpose of education to be the making of 
individuals who will be useful group members, whose ideal is one 
of co-operation, of service? Is there a possibility that such socializ- 
ing is only putting a camouflage roof over a very unsocial house, 
that a school organized on the basis of group recitations concerning 
academic subject-matter is an autocratic, unsocial organization? Is 
it only as people associate themselves into continuing or dissolving 
groups, directing themselves in the working out of their own pur- 
poses, themselves meeting the difficult problems of the varied 
temperaments and powers and faults of the members of the group, 
that they are in a really social atmosphere? 
CONDITIONS 
The attempt I am to describe was made in a small room, hold- 
ing thirty-three children of a seventh grade. Our working day was 
from 8:50 to 3:30 with a half-hour every day for a general school 
morning exercise, and an hour at noon for luncheon and play. A 
few subjects were taught by special teachers at set times. These 
were music, gymnastics, mathematics, and modern language, all 
occurring in the afternoons.. Let me confess that I had not the 
courage to leap into the water without a good old life preserver that 
I knew I could trust. So I kept a teacher-directed course in history 
running through the year. Of all these directed classes I say nothing, 
nor do I describe some additional important class projects—making 
desks for our whole class, hand-lettering and illuminating a quota- 
tion for our gift to the seniors, a study of naturalization in the 
United States, a study of the world crop. It was possible for the 
children to use the library, the clay shop, the manual training room, 
the science laboratory. We had for our own use as a general work 
shop what was originally built as a play house in our back yard. 
Now and then it was possible, in spite of crowded programs, to get 
the help of other teachers in case of special need. Most of the

time every day was unallotted, to be arranged as seemed best from 
day to day. Each evening I made the program for the following 
day, remembering what things were on the docket and making the 
necessary arrangements. Sample programs may be useful.

Each morning such a program was read to the class and posted 
for their consultation. It may be observed that only one hour is 
more or less sacred and unchangeable, and that is the ten o’clock 
period for individual study. In order to make clear what is meant 
by individual study, I show a list of the class with the subjects upon 
which each was working for that hour on a certain day.

“We are everywhere at once—some in the shop making a thea- 
ter, some in the library poring over books, some in the laboratory 
making experiments, some in the art room printing, and still others 
in the class room doing almost everything.” 
The following list will give an idea of the types of handwork 
chosen. The whole class was studying printing, but on account of 
the large size of the group and the small size of the print shop, only 
a third of the class could work there during a quarter. At the time 
the group of eleven was in the print shop, the others were engaged 
on their individual projects.

A word of explanation as to the appearance of both handwork 
and individual study. In my first attempt, a year earlier and in 
another school, to teach according to the project method, I felt 
distressed by the fact that practically all the projects were manual 
ones. At first I hoped that the installing of an aquarium, the 
making of a model sawmill, the drawing of different types of arches, 
would lead out into intellectual activities, would send children to 
books for further information, would drive them to written com- 
position for the sake of record or report, would send them on 
excutsions or investigation. But that kind of thing happened very 
rarely. F. was satisfied to install the aquarium and care for the 
fish. A. printed her calendar and had no desire to learn about the 
history of printing. At the beginning of Jast year, therefore, I had 
a little talk with the class, in which I pointed out the two kinds 
of work that people need to do, and we agreed to have two periods 
in the day for individual projects, one to be reserved for those 
activities demanding chiefly use of the hands, the other for those 
needing especially intellectual exercise. “This little device seemed to 
solve the problem, for most children really do care about getting the 
experiences they think they ought to have. It is surely right for 
children of this age to begin to be conscious of their mental processes 
and their mental needs. ° 
A few examples may show the kinds of projects that the chil- 
dren pursued and the manner of working. Two girls, L. and M., 
came to me one day and said they thought they would like to make 
a mimcograph for themselves like the one in the room. I said, 
“Very well, you had better make a drawing.” This they did, and 
they went to work by themselves in the outdoor shop during the 
handwork period. After a few days they wanted to know what 
sind of a report they could make. I said, “Oh, are you going to 
make a report?” for I had‘not thought of this handwork going 
over into anything more intellectual. “Oh, yes,” said they. They 
thought they might give a play showing how to use a mimeograph. 
I approved, and after a few days they presented three plays that 
they had written and wanted me to choose the one that I thought 
the best. I read them, wrote my criticisms, and returned them. A 
day or two later I found that they were not only studying mimeo- 
graphs, but investigating other duplicating devices. They used for 
reference “The World Book,” and one of them visited her father’s 
office. Besides, they were using the typewriter and mimeograph in
-P-A-G-E-13
12 Francis W. ParKer Scuoo. 
the room and in the school office. After a week’s absence of my 
own I returned to the school to find that M. was making a hecto- 
graph. She had found the recipe in “The World Book,” had gone 
to the store and bought glycerin, had brought gelatine from home, 
and had made a hectograph. When the group gave their report 
she successfully duplicated copies of the program as souvenirs. 
M. decided he wanted to study about armor. He made a book 
of ten drawings, illustrating armor from the time of the Greeks to 
the Middle Ages, with rather full notes, calling attention to the. 
changes and to points that the ordinary observer might miss. The 
matter of getting these notes into good form was a difficult and 
serious one for a boy who has much trouble with spelling. 
Three boys decided they wanted to make a toy theater. They 
began without having planned it very definitely. The scrap lumber 
which was given them was perhaps discouraging, or at least unin- 
spiring. After they had worked for several days in the outdoor 
shop, I went out to inspect. The theater was a sad looking affair. 
There was not a straight line in it, there were no square corners, 
the nails were too long and had been turned over, everything was 
askew, and every piece was covered with “rose buds.” I told: 
them yery frankly what I thought. They said, “Well, it isn’t look- 
ing very well. It’s hard to drive the nails.” I asked them whether 
they would like better wood. I suggested screws instead of nails 
and reminded them of what they had learned about try-squares and 
counter-sinks in making tables. They applied to the manual train- 
ing teacher for better wood and began all over again. Pretty soon, 
while I was’ out of school, I received a letter from J. saying, “We 
have got the theater almost done—not a nail in it!” I do not think 
that that was a waste of wood. The second theater I consider a 
creditable piece of work, and the boys aver that they learned much 
in making it. Whatever they learned came by experience, and that 
sort of knowledge is doubly valuable. 
The story of the completion and dedication of the theater is 
of some interest. On a certain Friday we were to give a party for 
the seniors. The theater group and the rest of the class felt that 
a puppet show would add to the joy of the occasion, but the theater 
was far from done, the puppets were not made, the scenery was 
unpainted, and the play was unlearned. “If you would let us work 
all day Thursday and Friday, I know we could finish it,” said one 
of the boys. The request was granted. The group worked like
-P-A-G-E-14
Stupres 1n Epucation 13 
beavers, and the play was presented. It was not a great success, and 
the boys found that the presentation of a puppet show involves more 
problems than they had dreamed of. Four other plays, however, 
were given after more preparation, and one of the group decided 
that his vocation in life was to be that of a playwright. 
The theater, moreover, was used for the presentation of a play 
by another group, and stimulated two other children to make a 
similar building. For J. and J., both girls of considerable manual 
skill and executive power, told me one day that they were making 
a toy theater at home and that the puppets were to be operated by 
magnets. One day, two weeks later, after school, they ruefully 
said that they were rather discouraged about their theater. “It looks 
like a box.” The next day they brought it to school and showed it 
to me. After a little discussion, they became fired with the idea 
of making a wooden front in the shape of a Greek temple. They 
drew sketches and made measurements and went down to the 
manual training shop for wood to take home. It was only a few 
days before the theater came back, looking very interesting, with 
little clay decorations, a pretty blue-and-white curtain, and a painted 
scene all complete. In the meantime the girls had written a play 
based on Horatius at the Bridge. The only things left to do in 
school were to paint the woodwork white, make the puppets—with- 
out the unruly magnets, alas !—and learn the parts. 
Two or three times, when given opportunity to choose his own 
homework, R. K. reported “Tanks,” and I made inquiries as to 
how he was getting his information and what he was going to do 
with it. “Oh, I read about them in the Scientific American and I 
am clipping pictures of them from the newspapers. I want to make 
a report to the class.” After a few more days he brought me a 
paper which he had planned as a climax to his report. It was 
called “A Surprise on the Germans.” Soon he brought all his 
pictures and asked for a large card to paste them on. The result 
was a pictorial chart illustrating the different kinds of tanks. 
The type of project demanding only reading for its working 
out may be illustrated by J.’s study of Egypt. She expressed herself 
as wanting to learn about different religions. As to the mainspring 
of the choice, I am not certain—possibly it was our slight study 
of the origin of Christianity. The first material I could find was 
Maspéro’s Ancient Egypt and Assyria. The great detail and the 
wealth of picture in the Egyptian chapters fascinated her and modi-
-P-A-G-E-15
14 Francis W, Parker ScHOOL 
fied her purpose into that of studying the religion and life of ancient 
Egypt. It happened that a high school class in ancient history had 
already accumulated for the school a large number of Egyptian wall 
paintings. These she studied and with them illustrated a report so 
full of definite detail, well classified and centered, that she held the 
class intensely interested. 
A boy whose uncle owned a tannery wanted to know about the 
tanning processes and wanted to instruct the class about them. He 
found accounts in two or three books, read them, aud then took 
an afternoon to visit the tannery. He brought back a piece of raw 
hide, pieces of leather that had undergone different processes, and 
a specimen of the tanning compound. He rigged up a box to repre- 
sent a drying room, cut a piece of leather into the shape of a hide 
and tacked it to a board, and in his report used all these materials 
for illustration. The most gratifying thing was his search for first 
hand knowledge. 
REPORTS 
It was our invariable custom, inaugurated with a bare sugges- 
tion and no pressure, that as soon as a child considered that his 
project had been carried as far as he could carry it, he should report 
his work to the class. After the first few reports proved successful 
and interesting, every child seemed to hold as a second purpose in 
study the preparation of a good report. We had some discussion 
now and then as to what constituted a good one. It was the unani- 
mous opinion that “just talk” was not enough; that there must be 
drawings, models, demonstration; that it was better not to read 
the report; that everybody ought to be given a chance to ask ques- 
tions; that it was better to make the class do some work if possible. 
The result’ was that as children worked they were planning how 
to make their reports successful, were taking notes for their talks, 
were making large drawings to show the class, were planning 
questions that they could ask, were trying to devise interesting and 
vivid ways of presenting their facts. One began his report with 
the question, “Do you know what rocks are?,” another with, “Do 
you suppose that people have always been able to make maps like 
those we have today?” . The day before two girls were to give 
theit report on China, they said to me, “Please ask the children to 
ask questions about China that they would like to have us answer 
tomorrow.” 
The length of the reports varied greatly, according to the sub-
-P-A-G-E-16
Srupres in Epucation 15 
ject and to the thoroughness of the student reporting. They occu- 
pied all the way from one half-hour period to five such periods 
scattered over five days. A half-hour seemed to be the norm in 
time for good listening, though one boy held his audience through 
an hour of talk and demonstration, A verbatim stenographic 
record of the report of two girls who had studied Japan will illus- 
trate the quality of the best of the reports. It shows, too, the amount 
of participation of the audience and the degree of relevancy and 
value in its additions and questions. When the class heard this 
record, be it said, they were surprised and disappointed. “It was 
one of the best reports of the year,” several said, “and this makes it 
sound silly.” “Those sentences sounded all right when they talked 
them, but when you read them they are ugly.” The group had on 
display a goodly number of Japanese prints belonging to the school, 
and of little objects of wood and bronze and ivory brought from 
home. The person talking was constantly turning to the screen 
where the picture hung, or picking up some object from the table. 
In the following account, the introductory and closing paragraphs 
were not spoken at the time of the report, but were written by one 
of the group when she edited the stenographic report for use in the 
record book. 
JAPANESE ART 
Seventh Grade April 25, 1919, 
(Stenographic Report, edited) 
Oriental and quaint is Japan, artistic in its own art as every other coun- 
try; not only in painting and sketching but in music, too, fer when you 
see the dark-eyed Geisha girls come bashfully along with their “Samisens,” 
playing low and monotonous tones all the while, you realize Japan is quaint 
and oriental in everything. 
_Miss Hall—Beatrice and Dorothy have been studying Japanese art— 
one of the last things they have studied in connection with Japan. They 
are going to report on Japan sometime,’ but they have chosen to report 
on the art. 
Beatrice —We are going to tell you about Japanese art. The first 
Japanese prints were done in black and white, and this was done for a 
great many years. The first colors they used were rose and green. We 
have a print here, which is the nearest we could get to the first prints that 
were made, and it shows a little green. This is a very old print. Then they 
added black and then yellow and then blue and then the rest of the colors. 
In 1900 they began printing one color over another. They did this with 
blocks. Dorothy will tell you about the blocks later.

later Dorothy will write them on the board. They are Kiyonaga, Utamaro, 
Yeishi, and two very famous ones are Hokusai and Hiroshige. Here are 
some of the very best pictures that illustrate four of the cight beauties of 
Omi. Omi is a little lake in Japan where the Japanese artists go to paint. 
There are just cight things they paint, and they call these the eight beauties 
of Omi. Among them are the bell tower and the fleet of boats. You will 
see lots of pictures of these same things but they are very different. The 
Japanese artists never make things natural. Here is one of Hiroshige’s paint- 
ings. This is a little Japanese garden that Jessica brought. It shows you 
how skilful the Japanese are. ~ 
Dorothy—Here are some blocks that Miss Clements made. She drew 
the design on the wood and then cut it out. The Japanese have certain 
kinds of knives that they use in making these blocks. Here is a piece of 
cloth that Miss Clements stamped. She laid the cloth down and then 
stamped it with these blocks. And here is another piece of cloth that she 
stamped. Sometimes they use more than one block. On this piece of 
goods she stamped the green first and then put the pink over it, like this. 
Here are more Japanese prints, and on this screen are Japanese drawings. 
They make just a few lines, but even though they do, the pictures are very 
pretty. Here are some pictures that the high school boys made in imitation 
of the Japanese. And here are some Japanese stencils. The way they make 
these stencils is this: they have two pieces of paper and they pull some hairs 
out of their head and lay them on this paper, and then they put the other 
piece of paper over it. The hair makes the stencil paper stronger. 
Dorothy—Here is one that is made without hair. They don’t put hair 
between the paper in all their stencils. 
Here is a stencil that represents bridges. In some of their drawings 
they make their objects upside down. Here is one with a bridge upside 
down. This is a design of flowers, and these are supposed to be bats. 
Question.—What are these stencils for? 
Dorothy.—They paint through them. They make some of their kimonas 
in that way. ° 
Foulke—My grandfather and my aunt—all of my aunts—got some 
Japanese stencils when they were in Japan, and when they came back they 
stenciled almost all their clothes. . 
Dorothy—Here are some little stencils and we will show how they 
paint through them. These havé no hairs in them and are made out of 
a little stiffer paper. 
Bernal (in audience)—You can buy those stencils any place. 
Beatrice-——This is the way they use the ink, These are rubbing plates. 
They take a stick and wet it, and then they rub on this plate. This is an 
India-ink stick. (The two girls each take a stencil and paint through tt 
on paper.) 
This may not be very successful. 
Foulke—That Japanese writing-box ] brought to school had ink of two 
colors, black and red. :
-P-A-G-E-18
Sruvies 1n Epucarion 17 
Charies—There are some people in the lower grades that make that 
kind of thing, and they use some kind of oil that they put on cardboard or 
wrapping paper, and it makes it tough, and then they draw the design in 
pencil and cut it out with a knife. They are making things in the little 
extra room for the third grade. Their viking ships are stenciled that way. 
Miss Hall—How many have seen those viking ships? (Most have seen 
them.) What kind of special oil do they use in making these stencils? 
Who knows? 
Answer—Linseed oil—the kind they get out of cotton. 
Miss Hall.—No, it is made from flax seed. 
Beatrice—We are doing these in black, but the Japanese color them. 
And this little brush is what they write with. We will show you some 
Japanese writing in just a minute, 
Comment.—I have heard that the Japanese make pictures of different 
colored sands, 
Beairice—Yes, they do use different colored sands and they make pic- 
tures with them. : . 
Question—In the sand? . 
Beatrice —No, they let the sand run down the paper from their hand. 
Question—How do they make it stick on? 
Beatrice —They have the paper on which they let the sand run on a 
level table or the floor. See, this design is finished. (She has taken off the 
stencil.) It is supposed to be wisteria. This is a little bird, but it did not 
turn out very well. 
Ward-—When Beatrice spoke of the different colored sands, it reminded 
me of the Pacific Exposition in California. In one of the big windows 
different grains were placed in such forms that they took the shape of 
pictures, and the work was done by a Japanese. 
Beatrice —This is the way they write. I did this myself—I copied it 
from a book. I think the Chinese is much the same. This means “Happy 
New Year” in printing, and this is “Happy New Year” in script. 
Question.—What, do you mean by “script?” 
Beatrice —Script is your handwriting and printing is like the printing 
of newspapers or books. 
Beatrice —The Japanese prints are much different from what they were 
years ago. You will notice these modern ones are in all colors, These two 
are old ones. . 
I am going to show you a Japanese book. Instead of beginning at the 
front as our books do, the Japanese book opens from the back. (Turning 
the leaves showing colored prints.) Here is one that is very modern. Here 
is another. This is beautiful, but more modern. This picture shows the 
way Japanese draw roosters. It is not at all like ours. It looks more like 
a pheasant than a rooster. 
My father says that in Japan the pheasants are used like our chickens. 
The people carry them along, dragging their beautiful plumage in the dirt. 
They don’t count them for anything, but they think it is perfectly horrible 
for us to kill chickens.
-P-A-G-E-19
18 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
Wiiliam—tI know that in Japan they do have roosters with long tails 
just like that one in the picture. I saw a picture and they said it was a 
Picture of the rooster that took the prize for the longest tail. It had grown 
very long. It was more than a yard long. They feed the roosters and do 
everything to make the tail grow, until maybe it stops growing, and then 
they bring it to a show, and if they cannot make it grow any longer, they 
throw it away and try another. 
Question.—I wonder if they think our drawings are beautiful? 
Beatrice-——No, they do not like them at all. 
Miss Hall—Do you mean to say the rooster is not well drawn? 
Beatrice—I mean the drawing is different from ours. The Japanese 
never do anything real—they try to make it fancy—according to their 
imagination. . 
Miss Hall—Once in a while lately when you have been lettering and 
have been trying to think of a design, I would say, “Conventionalize some 
flower.” I would try to explain by saying, “Don’t try to make it realistic; do 
something to change it, to make it fit what you want it to.” Is that what . 
you mean? 
Beatrice—Yes. The Japanese want to conventionalize all things; they 
draw to suit their fancy. 
Frederick—Are the Japanese words. divided up into letters, or is it 
learned like shorthand, and then different signs for different words like 
ours? . 
Beatrice —Yes, each one of these is a word. Sometimes a symbol stands 
for a syllable instead of a word. 
Someone—I saw an American who lived in Japan and he told us that 
lots of signs that you think are letters are just syllables divided up and put 
on top of each other so that they look like one Jetter. 
Beatrice —That is true. 
Question—Do the Chinese read from the back of the book, like the 
Japanese? 
Beatrice—Yes. They are like the Japanese. Here is another Japanese 
book. This gives you an idea of their. imagination. It is a book of wave 
designs. They are very beautiful, but they are not true to the waves. 
(Turning over the leaves.) All these are supposed to be wave designs. 
Comment—They took more like clouds. 
Beatrice —This one is more real, and this one shows the foam on the 
waves. But you see, they could not possibly be true. 
John—What is the idea of drawing things that have no meaning in 
them? 
Beatrice—They think them beautiful. 
Miss Hall—I think John will get his answer without anybody’s saying 
anything, next month when he begins to plan the imaginative portion of 
his card. It is a matter of making a space beautiful. If you decide that a 
flower does not fill a space, you adapt it. Have any of you in this grade 
had experience in doing just this thing? 
Laura.—That thing we were making this morning.
-P-A-G-E-20
Stupies in Epucation 19 
Beatrice—Yes. Jessica made a cross in her stained glass window. It is 
still up there. But you can see it is more imaginative than a real cross. 
And it is much more beautiful. (Still holding open the book of designs.) 
Do you see this design here? It looks more like a fan than anything I 
can think of, but it is supposed to be a wave. It is drawn on a fan. 
Here are some more Japanese prints. This one is very. old. We are 
going to have these hanging around the room so that you may see them 
afterwards. . 
John.—I thought you said they didn’t have any colors. These are in 
color. 
Beatrice —These were made after the Japanese began to use colors. 
The Japanese have a different perspective from our artists. They show the 
perspective by color. In this print the background is drawn in gray to make 
it look far away. If we want to make an object.look far away, we show it 
in the lines. 
Miss Hall—Does anyone know what “perspective” means? 
John—We had it last year with Miss Claussenius. 
Beatrice-—You probably remember last year, when Miss Claussenius 
showed us when we tried to draw those pictures of trees. We drew a pic- 
ture of a railroad straight up and down, but. drew the lines closer together 
at the top, and it looked far away. But the Japanese print is often colored 
to look far away. You see it in these pictures. 
Question—What are those little marks on the side of the picture? 
Beatrice-—Those are the names of the artists, Now, in this old picture, 
the name of the artist is away down here, and in this one it is up there. 
The artist uses his name as a balance, as a part of the picture. The Amer- 
ican artists write their names in the corner. On this print, this is the name 
of the picture, and this the name of the artist, balancing it on the other 
side. This one shows you that the Japanese don’t like to make things true. 
A tree does not grow like that. 
This one has faces of the Japanese—the artists make their faces nearly 
all alike—not like real people. 
Miss Hall—We need to remember that Japanese faces are not like ours. 
Beatrice—This one is much like the others. You will notice their faces. 
Here is a box, hand-made. Miss Hall thinks the wood is set in. 
Miss Hall—The Japanese have a way of shaving wood as thin as paper. 
They have very great skill in this. The top of this box is made of natural 
woods of different colors, and they are glued on top in the form of pic- 
tures. 
Dorothy.~Here are some hand-carved chop-sticks. And here is another 
set with little things at the end so that you can hang them to your belt. The 
black ones are of ebony. I do not know what kind of wood the others are 
made of. 
And so, having passed through the eight beauties of Omi, the prints, the 
sketches, the stencils, the designs, and the arts of Japan, and having realized 
them, we awoke with the buzzer to find ourselves not in Nippon, The Land 
of the Rising Sun, but in our own seats.

20 Francis W. Parker Scuoon 
I have a few unanswered questions concerning these reports. 
One was put by a visitor. “Do they want to hear the reports?” he 
asked. Early in the year I had asked myself the same question, 
when a class often made a restless audience, so one day I said, “We 
have two reports ready today. Let’s have them at the same time. 
You may choose what one you will hear.’ There was vigorous 
objection. Several people said, “I want to hear both.” Some of 
those who were to report complained, “Then we can’t hear W.’s 
‘Battleships !’ ” 
Later in the year, however, no protests were made at such a 
division. In an attempt to get a true light on the matter of the 
interest in the reports, I asked the children to write on the follow- 
ing question: 
“How do you feel about the interest and value of reports?” 
With one exception all considered the reports very valuable. I 
quote a few interesting expressions of opinion. 
“TI have a chance to see and understand what some of the other mem- 
bers of our class are studying about and how they study their reports.” 
+B, 
“I think from the reports I get a larger circle of knowledge in a shorter 
time than otherwise.” Cc. 
“£ get much information out of reports, and when I gave one it made 
me recall all I had studied.” R. 
“IT feel that reports are essential. I think reports teach all concerned.” 
. L. 
“T think that most of the reports were interesting to the class, because 
I think that most children of our age are interested chiefly in the same kind 
of subjects.” F 
“I think that some of the reports were not interesting to me, but were 
to the boys.” *M. 
“T think there’s a lot of value in reports if the report is given well, but 
I think that some of the reports have been sort of dull. One thing that 
makes a report dull is to read it and not have any pictures, drawings, or 
models. I think that one thing that helped the ‘Battleship’ report was the 
drawings, and I think that one thing that helped my report was the model 
of the real airplane.” F, 
“f think they are probably the most valuable things we have had, for 
they have been on so many different subjects. Some of them I never 
thought about, but they are interesting just the same. And others I have 
wondered about but hadn’t had time yet to study and perhaps never would 
have gotten time for all.” *M. 
“T think the majority of reports are very good and that we get a great
-P-A-G-E-22
Srupies in EpucaTion 21 
deal from them, especially if we have them in written form in our note 
books, but on some reports I don’t think the papers do justice to the report, 
while in others they are told better than the report.” F. 
“Although a person may not be interested in a certain subject, if the 
subject is cleverly and interestingly given it is worth listening to to get 
ideas from. Most of the reports given this year have been good for two 
principal reasons. First the material has been good, and second they have 
been well told.” *H. 
There is always a question in my mind as to how effective these 
reports are for the rest of the class; for one always feels that the 
good is to the reporter and not to the hearer. A few times I gave 
short tests seven or eight days after the reports were made, but with 
varying results. 
On these pieces of conflicting evidence, I have not been able 
to arrive at conclusions. Did the children enjoy the reports? Did 
they get sufficient profit from them? Did the listening to them and 
the attempt to write accounts of them encourage superficial think- 
ing? On the other hand, was the giving of the report so valuable 
as a stimulus to those giving it that we may be willing to risk its 
disadvantages? Did the listening to the variety of subjects pre- 
sented do so much for the class in beginning new interests and in 
arousing appreciation of one another’s powers that the good coun- 
ter-balanced possible ill effects? During this year I must gather 
evidence on these questions. 
After a very few reports had been given, I made the suggestion 
that we should keep a book of written accounts. This proved to be 
a very successful institution. At the end of the year it was a rather 
complete and illustrated curriculum of the seventh grade of 1919. 
Very rarely was the writing of these papers anything but voluntary. 
I usually offered the alternative of writing So-and-so’s report or of 
doing something else. I give three accounts as examples. They are 
made up of the best parts of papers written by children who got 
their facts almost entirely from the report. In these cases I did the 
choosing and editing. “At other times a committee of children did 
it, and such editing seems to me very good training in criticism. 
HISTORY OF ART 
Beauty and knowledge are the things worth while having. Another 
name for beauty is art. Art is truly a wonderful thing, not a thing of 
one country, but each and every country has its own original art. Egypt, 
the mother of all arts, Greece and Rome with their wonderful sculpturing,
-P-A-G-E-23
22 Francis W. Parker ScHOooL 
Italy with its remarkable painting, and so on until you realize that art is a 
wonderful, beautiful thing to have. Art has lived thousands of years. It is 
impossible to tell how long it will live. During all the years of its life it 
has been improved upon. 
How could we know the history of the Egyptians if it were not for 
the wonderful carving on temples and tombs? For the writing is so very 
strange that it was not until the eighteenth century that a stone was found 
that enabled scholars to read the writing. As I said before, Egypt is the 
mother of all arts. Her art was not perfect, no, not perfect by any means, 
for who was ahead of her to teach her? But Egypt is the land of columns, 
carving, and pyramids. - 
  DRAWINGS USED IN REPORTS 
There was an Egyptian king who spent almost all his life in building 
his tomb. He made pictures of his life on the walls and wrote on the walls 
about himself; but when he died, the people did not bury him in it because 
he had been a very wicked king. His name was Cheops. 
The Egyptians made many monuments in the form of obelisks, An 
obelisk is a four-sided stone pillar of one piece, tapering as it rises. It is 
carved with pictures and hieroglyphics. A few years ago the government 
of modern Egypt gave America an obelisk. It-is in Central Park, New 
York City. Washington Monument is shaped like an obelisk, though it is 
much larger. . 
The Egyptian temples are ali much alike, and so I will describe them 
in general. The gate was led-up to by an avenue of sphinxes and obelisks. 
In this avenue the people worshipped, as they were not allowed in the
-P-A-G-E-24
Sruptes in Epucation 23 
temple. Just before the door there was a strange looking flat arch, called 
a pylon. In the temple at the farthest end was the cella where the jewel- 
hung god was kept. Inside the temple there was row upon row of columns 
supporting the roof. This was not only for strength but for beauty also. 
The largest temple in Egypt is the temple of Ammon at Karnak. This is 
really a vast forest of wonderful columns. These columns are all carved 
and painted. Its twelve central columns are sixty feet high and twelve feet 
in diameter. 
Let us leave Egypt to go to a more known and beautiful art, the Greek 
art. This is very beautiful because it is so natural. In Egyptian drawings 
there is a side view of the feet, front view of the shoulders, and side of the 
head. They did this because it was easier to draw. The faces they made 
were conventionalized. Although you could not pick out what is wrong, 
it can plainly be seen that the face is stony and expressionless. But the 
Greeks knew how to make the human face look human and alive. They 
did not make the face and arms of their statues look dead and. stiff and 
cold, they made them look alive and easy and warm, 
There were many, many statues of men and women, and gods, and 
very beautiful, too. One of the seven wonders of the world was a statue 
of Zeus. It was made of gold and ivory and had a wreath of green gold 
around its head. It stood once in Olympia, but we have it no more. Another 
very famous statue is the Hermes of Praxiteles. It got its name from 
Praxiteles, its sculptor. Hermes jis standing erect, and in one arm he holds 
the baby god of mirth and wine, Dionysos. The history of Venus de Milo 
is of interest. On Melos, a little island near Greece, lived a farmer. One 
day when he was walking he saw a cave and went into it. Inside he saw 
an ancient statue of a goddess. Both arms were broken off and one foot, 
but all the rest was perfect. He then took the statue home and sold it to 
a Frenchman. Then it was given to a king and put into the Louvre in 
Paris. Another of the wonderful works of art is the Winged Victory. 
Once a Frenchman went to Samothrace. He was digging and found two 
hundred pieces of marble. He sent them to Paris, where they were put 
together and found to be the Winged Victory. They found that Victory 
was standing on the prow of a ship. The reason that the statue is noted 
among the wonderiul master-pieces is that the gown is draped so gracefully 
on the statue ard the wings are placed so gracefully. 
There is another lovely thing about Greece. That is the wonderful 
columns, There are three parts to these columns, the base, the shaft, and 
the capital. The capital is decorated beautifully, but on some columns it 
is just plain. The shaft has grooves in it all the way down. They call these 
grooves flutes. Columns are all designed in the most beautiful fashions 
though somewhat alike. Let us close here with a picture of the Parthenon, 
and around it altars and beautiful statues.

LENSES 
Light! What a wonderful thing it is! The rising of the sun in the 
great east brings light, and the setting brings darkness. We do not know
-P-A-G-E-25
24 Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
how wonderful it really is, but if it were to be shut away and all the world 
was involved in darkness, then only should we realize its strength, On 
Friday Frederick brought us to realize it a little better when he gave 
us a report on lenses, a very important branch of science. This report was 
given by a great many demonstrations and drawings. He had not only 
glass lenses but lenses from eyes. He had a camera, a pin hole camera and 
a camera obscura. He aise explained that reflection means when light 
strikes an object it is thrown back and that refraction means that the light 
is bent. 
It was a dreary, dingy shop with only one window, in which stood a 
vase half filled with water. Sitting before this was an old man with a tablet 
and pen. While thinking for the next verse he glanced through the win- « 
dow and saw to his amazement the building on the other side of the street 
enlarged and magnified. Why? He had been looking through the vase and 
water. He immediately told his friends, and they made other experiments, 
such, as hollowing out two pieces of glass and filling them with water and 
then closing them. Thus was made the first water lens. There are many 
kinds of lenses. Some magnify, some diminish the object, while others do 
not do either so strongly. 
There are two kinds of cameras, one is called the pin hole camera, the 
other is called the lens camera. The pin hole camera is nothing more than 
an oblong box with a covered pin hole at one end and a sensitive plate at 
the other end. When a picture is taken the pin hole is pointed away from 
the sun on the object. When the cover is taken off the pin hole, the sun 
shining on the object reflects in different shades off the object and the rays 
going straight to the pin hole go through and are printed on the sensitive 
plate. The pin hole is then covered again so the light does not spoil the 
sensitive plate. Later the sensitive plate is taken out in a dark room and 
is used to print the pictures on paper. 
The pictures taken with a pin hole camera are not as clear as those 
taken with a lens because they have no lens in them by which they could 
clarify the rays coming from the object. , 
The lens camera can also be a box with a sensitive plate in the back 
but the front part of the box is supplied with a finder, an automatic shutter, 
and a lens. The finder is up in the corner of the camera, and you look into 
it from the top and see the object the camera is pointing at. The image 
of the object goes through the lens to the mirror upside down because in 
going through the lens it is turned upside down. Then the mirror throws 
it up to your eye right side up. The shutter takes the place of the cover in 
the pin-hole camera and can be set to stay open for a certain length of 
time and then to close. 
The lens’s action on the rays which enter the camera is to clarify them. 
The rays from the top part of the object, striking the lens at the top, are 
refracted toward the middle of the lens and are so thrown on the bottom 
part of the plate, and the rays from the top part of the object, striking the 
middle of the lens, have no middle to be refracted toward, and go straight 
on and so strike the bottom of the plate also. This makes it clearer than
-P-A-G-E-26
Stupies 1n EpucatTion 25 
if only one ray struck the plate. But the plate has to be where these two 
rays cross or there will not be a clear picture. | 
The eye is a very peculiar thing. The part that we call the pupil is 
really a hole, and the black that we see is the retina. This is a, little black 
curtain fike the screen on which a moving picture is thrown. The part that 
is blue in some people’s eyes and brown in others, acts as a protector to the 
retina, for, if you have noticed, the size of the pupil often changes. When ~ 
you come into the light it is very small, but when you are in a darkened 
place it becomes larger. The lens is a transparent ball, and it is what 
makes us see things. It is right behind the retina and is set in a substance 
very much like a colorless jelly. 
Miss Hall brought several fish eyes to school, and she took one apart 
for us. The outside of the eye has a very thin substance around it which 
is very much like thin bone. With a sharp pair of pointed scissors she cut 
around it in a circle, being very careful not to cut too deep for fear of 
cutting something that was inside. This left the eye cut in half. In doing 
this. Miss Hall cut into the colored part of the eye and a stream of blue 
fluid came pouring out. I should think they could use this liquid for dyeing. 
It surely dyed the paper and our hands. We then looked through the half 
of an eye and saw first a white and then a dark ring and then a little white 
ball on the order of a very small glass marble. This was the lens. We 
took it out of its jelly surroundings and tried to look through it. We could 
do it, for it was perfcctly transparent, but after it had been out for a while 
it turned milky. Miss Hall then said the children who wanted to could each 
have an eye and take it apart for themselves. I received one and took it 
apart but after I had the lens out I pressed on it a little too hard and I 
thought it was broken, but, instead the top layer came off and I found 
the part left was perfectly solid, just like glass. 
Tf it were not for our nerves we should see things upside down, for a 
fens sees them upside down. We proved this by taking a glass lens into a 
dark room and holding it in front of a white screen with a lighted candle 
on the other side. After it was focused we saw the candle very clearly but 
upside down. The same thing would happen to us if it were not for the 
little white nerve that carries the message to the brain, saying, “It is really 
this way, not upside down.”

about. 
When we were all four or five we could talk, but we did not know 
our alphabet. But some people say we cannot talk without one. Well, 
how did the Hawaiians talk a hundred years ago? They did not have any 
alphabet but they talked, did they not?

“A BC,” a child says at school. Now just sit down and think and 
find out how alphabets were invented. “Aha!” says a bright brain from the 
corner, “I know how the alphabets were made. They were made up from 
old Indian and white men’s drawings in the sand and on tree trunks like 
this, 
AEN A, ’     
What letters are those? Why, those are just a few drawings meaning 
something in those days. From that time on the alphabet grew more com- 
mon, and when you look back at them in ancient books you can see how 
much more like the modern ones they grew.”

The Indians used picture writing. The above cculd mean, “Many 
people are going east, and they will be there many nights,” or, “Many people 
are going east and it will take them many nights to get there,” and it may 
even be translated as, “Many people will go east and they will die before they 
return.” The first figure with the fingers spread out means many, the next 
means east and the last means sleep. The little figures are used to represent 
space between words. As the picture writing could be translated in so 
many ways it was not satisfactory. 
ghawe mgriry fat ~ @ of OK (pf ~   
Now that there were alphabets they spread to every place where there 
were people. For instance, the Phoenician traders taught their alphabet to 
the Greeks, though the Greeks made a few changes. A Greek priest from 
a monastery in Constantinople was preaching to the Russians and showed 
them how to show sounds by different signs. A missionary from the 
United States gave the Hawaiians their alphabet. The Romans, being con- 
querors of much of Europe, taught the people their alphabet, and today 
most European people use the Roman alphabet. When the English came 
to America they brought the English or Roman alphabet with them. Spain 
and Portugal also used the Roman alphabet. When they settled South 
America and Mexico they spread the Roman alphabet there. So only the 
Roman alphabet is used in America. . 
‘There are differences in the number of letters in the alphabets of 
different countries. The Russian alphabet has thirty-five letters, and our 
alphabet has twenty-six, and the Hawaiian alphabet has eleven or twelve 
letters in it. The reason for this is that some countries do not have all

Some languages need more letters to form the words because they have

more sounds, like the Russian language. 
We get the word “alphabet” from the first two Greek letters. -They 
are alpha, beta. You can readily see the connection between them and the 
word “alphabet.”

HOMEWORK 
A great deal of our children’s time is given to homework. It 
is a common practice for teachers to plan that work, yet we cannot 
supervise it very well at a distance. Would it not be well for us 
to give our pupils in this matter the possibility of choice and of 
self-direction? Shall I, moreover, by my action give the child to 
understand that he is incapable of making his own choices and 
plans and of directing himself? Shall I crush his self-respect and 
his ambition by showing that I consider his interests of little worth? 
Let me not rob him of his rightful leisure—as important a requisite 
for right living as food and sleep and brains. Let me not discourage 
his forming the habit of making his own disposal of his own time. 
I want his life at school and his life at home to be parts of a whole— 
a whole that is rich, interesting, purposeful, satisfying living, not a 
treadmill existence. 
I tried a plan of voluntary homework. There were three types 
of arrangement. Sometimes when there was a piece of work that 
needed everybody’s co-operation, I assigned the work for the night. 
Examples of this are the writing of a paper about our year, to be 
printed in one of our school publications, or a piece of reading for 
history. Most commonly I offered two or three alternatives of 
work that either needed to. be done or would be worth doing, and 
asked the children to choose. Take one night for example. Certain 
children chose to decorate the covers of their record books; others 
wrote accounts of a report given that day. We were all engaged, 
too, in trying to find quotations to illustrate the word “steadfast,” for 
use in a piece of lettering we were planning to do as a gift for the 
seniors. I suggested that something might be found in a certain 
story of Socrates, and several of the children chose to do this read- 
ing. A third type of homework is more interesting. When I was 
rather sure that most of the pupils had something they wanted to 
do, I said, “What do you want to do for homework? Put a little 
note into my bag telling me what it is. If you can’t decide, come to 
me for advice.” TI give the homework program of two such nights:

Of course there is danger that by always choosing for home- 
work the kind of activity most attractive to them, children may 
miss exercise in other activities where they need practice. Nothing 
is easier, of course, than to make occasional assignments to correct 
this trouble. When I found, therefore, that certain children who 
did not write well were not choosing to write papers, I told them 
that because of this need of theirs they must write every time there 
was an opportunity, and I saw to it that they planned such homework 
for themselves. 
Up to the last month of school, it was my custom to check up 
in the morning on homework, to collect papers or models or draw- 
ings that had been made, or to ask for a word of report, oral or 
written, on such work as had not resulted in any objective thing. 
I felt a shortcoming in this system, however. The pupil was not 
sufficiently conscious of the type, quality, and amount of work 
that he had been doing. He was not faced with his failures and 
shortcomings. I might see his record stretching behind him, but 
he could not. So I devised the following report for the child to 
keep. It was tacked inside his desk top and was filled out daily. 
It was on trial for the last month and was faithfully and interestedly 
kept. Most of the class thought that it helped them to do regular 
and earnest work. I give examples to illustrate types and habits 
of work. (pps. 30 and 31). 
RECORDS 
I have said earlier that it seems very important for anyone who 
does a piece of work to judge of the success of it after it is finished. 
We must learn to hold ourselves up to our best; for—though it is 
-platitudinous to say so—no one else can do that, no one else can 
even know what our best is. Comment from parent or teacher or 
employer may be sweet to the taste, but unless it is corroborated 
or refuted by the worker’s own intelligent and honest appraising, 
it will work evil. If unfavorable, it will cause discontent and sour- 
ness and rebelliousness. If favorable, it will tend to create syco- 
phancy. In either case, it will make for loss of independence and

originality. The worker ought to ask himself, “Have I worked my 
hardest all the while, or have I wasted time? Did I work better 
on this last job than I did on the one before? Is this thing I have 
made as good as I could have made it? Do I work as well as 
others do? If not, what can I learn from them? Am J getting the 
experience I need, or am I letting myself become narrow by always 
doing the same kind of thing? Am I learning to hold myself to 
finishing what I began? Have I contributed my share to the class?” 
This year we are using the following kind of record: 
  
Date or |{No. Days| Date or |Report 
Purits Project BrcinninG|WorkeD | Frnisuinc|GiveN”   
    
During his work and at the end of it the pupil posts these facts 
on this blank so that his record, side by side with the records of 
others of the class, is open for consultation of himself and everyone 
else. Upon the finishing of his project I shall, I think, ask him to 
report to me in writing his own judgment of his work; if he has 
made a report, I shall ask those hearing it to write their judgments. 
A discussion with the pupil of all this data will, one would think, 
help him to understand himself—his habits, his powers, his failures, 
his needs. 
APPRAISAL 
1. Children’s.—It is quite necessary for me to judge the degree 
of success and failure of my own project, namely, the teaching of 
this class. In an attempt to do this I have drawn as frankly as 
possible from three sources—the children, their mothers, and myself. 
After an interesting half hour’s discussion, in which T presented 
the following questions and in which almost the whole class talked 
very eagerly and very frankly, I asked them that night to write 
what they had to say regarding the same matters. I print here 
excerpts from some of the most interesting of those answers.
-P-A-G-E-34
Srupizs 1n Epucation 33 
Question —Has this year been in any way different from other school 
years? 
“In grades before this the teacher has done most of the thinking and 
teaching, while in this grade we have to teach ourselves and others in the 
class as well.” *J, 
“If any of us had a hobby, such as wireless telegraphy, you could work 
it out in this grade.” *y 
“The teacher has given the pupil a chance to choose for himself what 
he wants to study, and finding his own material from books and magazines 
and giving him the practice of making a speech or a report to the class 
when he has finished his study.” +B, 
“The children have taught mostly, and I like that, for it is not only 
good for them to have to plan their reports, but I think when a- teacher, 
you might say, gives a report, she tells the facts and does it interestingly, 
but don’t have the drawings, etc., and I think it is things like that that 
make reports most interesting.” ¥*M. 
“I feel sort of sore when I miss individual study for something that I 
think is not near so profiting and interesting.” B. 
“We had to work more for what we got, and the work was done in 
such a way that it was fun to do it.” Cc. 
Question—How has your work at hone this year compared with that 
of other years? 
“When you do not have much home work, you can do it better.” 
L. 
“T do not think I have done as much home work as I did in fifth grade 
and about as much as I did in sixth, but what I did was done willingly, and 
so I got more out of it.” Cc. 
“T haven’t done quite as much as last year, but I have learned so much 
in individual study that it makes up.” F. 
“T think the home work has been much more interesting this year and 
for this reason I haven’t dreaded it as I used to, especially written papers.” 
*M. 
“Other years I did my home work, but this year I have not done it that 
way but for a few times, but I think the reason is that lots of times we 
work on our individual study or read, and I would do that in my free time 
outside of school if it were not home work.” *B. 
“T think I have done more work this year and spent a longer time on 
it. For instance, when I made the cover for my Record Book I spent two 
hours on it, and I wouldn’t have been so interested if it had been something 
else.” *J, 
“The home work this year is very different than other years,—just like 
everything else. I have never liked home work, because it used to mean a 
paper or some French or arithmetic, and I liked to read and work at things 
at home. So going into this grade I thought that the words home work 
meant the same thing here, so I have not had as much interest in it until 
just a couple of weeks ago, when I began to understand what home work 
meant in the seventh grade.” J.
-P-A-G-E-35
34 Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
Question—Have you had the experience that you need? Have you 
missed anything that you need? 
Many said without comment that they had not had enough ex- 
cursions, spelling, arithmetic. A few thought they had not had 
enough grammar, one not enough reading aloud, two not enough 
art, one not enough American history. 
“If we could have had less in history and used that time for spelling, 
it would have been better, but I do not mean spell-downs.” *M. 
“I have missed spelling, and I need it, I think, because there are some 
words I know a girl in the seventh grade ought to know how to spell, and I 
do not know how to spell them. I think that almost all of us need more 
grammar, because 1 think if we knew more about grammar we could form 
our sentences better.” __ *K, 
“T think if we had more excursions, we would learn things a whole lot 
better, and I think if we had excursions with some of the reports, it would 
be more interesting, and if it is possible I think it. would be a good plan to 
take the grade on an excursion to a glass factory for my report, and then 
the next day I would explain what they didn’t understand.” *M. 
“What I have missed I can gain some other year, while what I have 
gained is of more value than what I have lost.” J. 
Question.—In what directions have you gained most? 
“This year I think I have gained most the knowledge of common things, 
such as how to make paper. I also have learned how to give an interesting 
report.” J. 
“T have learned how to work by myself, and how much fun it is to work.” 
Cc. 
“I think the thing I gained in most was learning how to work by myself 
without other people’s help.” Ww. 
“We have learned better how to express ourselves in words, by giving 
reports, and how to better express ourselves by writing papers.” +H. 
“I think individual study has proved to teach us more than anything 
else. For instance, I did not know what subways were and their purpose, 
as I never took the time to find out what they were, until we had the report 
on them, and then I found out. I think this is the case with many other 
children and other subjects.” *D. 
“T think I have gained most in seeing material and demonstrations in 
reports,” *B. 
“I gained most in individual study, because I made things, learned how 
to work, and was interested.” R. 
“This year I have learned to write better papers. I used to hate to write. 
I have also improved more this year in reading than any other year.” 
Cc 
“To speak in front of many people.” J. 
‘T have gained in learning how to study myself. I have gained confi- 
dence in recitations.” *E. 
“T think I have gained in the direction of feeling towards my work. At
-P-A-G-E-36
Stupies IN Epucation - 35 
the beginning of the year I had a happy-go-lucky feeling that I would just 
get my work good enough to pass as all right and let it go at that, but after- 
wards I began to want to do my work a little better and try to beat So-and-so 
at writing a good paper, until now I have gotten so that I try to make all 
my papers the best I can do.” J. 
“When you work yourself this way, the result isn’t so good, but you 
Jearn more.” J. 
“Ym sure I’ve gained in’ broader interests, because before this year I 
had the impression that some studies were for boys and others for girls, 
but now [ am interested in many things, such as wireless telegraphy, traps, 
etc. This is mostly on account of other people’s work.” +B. 
“I think that I have gained most in seff-direction. That is, judging 
whether I should work on my home work three-quarters of an hour or 
three hours, etc. When I thought I needed hard work on a certain thing 
IT would work hard on it.” F, 
2. Mothers’--I am disappointed in the value of the data col- 
lected from mothers, because it is not representative. Only eleven 
out of thirty-three replied, and of these eleven one was almost 
entirely ignorant of what was being done at school. The other ten 
replies, however, are thoughtful. Eight are in general favorable, and 
two unfavorable. [ submit one of each type. The first concerns a 
boy of unusually good intellectual habits and power, who, his mother 
feels, did not work up to his best. The second deals with another 
boy, normal, thoughtful, intelligent : 
Question —Has he done much school work at home? 
1. Until within the last month has done very little. Reads a great deal 
at all times and good books. 
2. Yes, especially in getting together material for subjects selected. 
Question—Has he shown interest in his school work by talking of it at 
home? 
1. Not so-much as usual. I have had to draw out of him by careful 
questioning most of the information I have gotten, 
2. Yes, his own work and that of members of his class. 
Question.—Has he worked at it with interest, concentration, intensity? 
1. No. His last paper, on the Battle of. Hastings, yes. 
2. Yes, with pleasure added. 
Question —Does he feel satisfied with his school year? 
1. He is not dissatisfied. 
2. Very much so. 
Question-—What do you think he has gained? 
1. I know that he has gained, but cannot be concrete. 
2. (a) Independence and originality in thought. 
(b) Independence and originality in gathering material for study. 
(c) Observes more closely. 
(d) Thought power developed.
-P-A-G-E-37
36 Francis W. ParKER ScHoo. 
(e) Masters facts more readily. 
(£) Development of written expression. 
(g) Development of oral expression. 
(h) Recognizes that he is an individual and not merely one of a class. 
(i) Best of all, individual work develops initiative. 
Question-—IWhat lacks have you felt? 
1. My attitude is not critical. It is ignorant. Had I seen an awakening 
in my child such as Mrs, -—-—— and Mrs. - --— have seen, I should 
have proof. I have seen in ———— no tangible evidence of such an awaken- 
ing, rather groping and uncertainty of direction. 
2. Lack of ability to read well, which is due in large measure to poor 
training (which he received in the public school of his home town) in the 
first four grades, where a child learns to read. 
Question.—Has his school life affected his attitude at home? 
1. Not that I am aware of. 
2. Unanswered. 
3. Teacher’s—Now I myself must answer these questions. 
The data on which I found my answers is perhaps not very scientific, 
not very methodical, liable to misinterpretation on account of the 
personal equation, and yet I am trying sincerely to arrive at a just 
judgment of the year. Let me return to the purposes which I 
named in the second paragraph of this article. 
To Increase Intensity of Individual Action—~—Several children 
in the class certainly did not improve in this regard. Others 
decidedly did so. Over and over I saw eight and ten children in 
our small room working for an hour at different projects, some 
reading, some writing, some drawing, two or three holding a quiet 
conference in the corner, one working at the typewriter, another 
operating the mimeograph, and all working industriously and not 
disturbing one another for the whole period. Again, when I com- 
pare the degree of attention given by these same children in one of 
my own recitations with the degree of attention and effort that they 
gave when they were engaged on their own projects, I am sure 
that in several individual cases the quality was much higher in the 
project period and that in only two cases was it lower. 
To Preserve Individual Differences.—In a class recitation J.’s 
musing habit, his self-absorption, his slow rhythm, his slow speech, 
did not make for success. But when he worked alone, poring over 
maps and pictures for an hour at a time, comparing and re-com- 
paring references, browsing in a book and making unexpected 
discoveries, he was building up a fullness and accuracy of image, 
a sureness of intellectual grasp, that displayed themselves delight-  
-P-A-G-E-38
Srupirs in EpucaTion 37 
fully in his report on forestry, when he talked of trees with a quiet 
appreciation and gentle authority that impressed even the most 
shallow ones of the class. A certain girl in a recitation was like 
an unskilled swimmer in a maelstrom, but she was a tower of 
strength when she had some practical job in hand, and she felt 
power and encouragement and won respect at the typewriter and 
the mimeograph and in the shop. The avidity of another was likely - 
to drive -her in impatience to surreptitious drawing or writing or 
reading during a recitation, but when she cotild go at her own gait 
she devoured books on Egypt or the Incas, planned her report like 
lightning, and gave a talk that held the class enthralled. And so 
I-might go on. Of course faults, alas !—as well as virtue, had their 
chance to grow. Two boys did meet on the way to the library 
and exchange epithets and blows. When a little group was alone 
in the outdoor shop, one weak member did attire himself in a sheet 
meant to cover the clay model and entertain his mates with a ghost 
dance. When supposed to be reading a book, K. did spend much 
of the time gazing around the room. But is it not true that one’s 
faults can be stamped out only when one’s own will fights with 
them? Under outside restraint they only smoulder. 
To Drain the Power of Chaice=-At the beginning of the year 
perhapsa_ a fourth of the class were without any idea of what they 
wanted to do. Several others chose things that I recommended or 
were stimulated by the suggestion of some of their playmates. At 
the end of a project, many children came to me for suggestion as 
to what to do next. At the close of the year this was true of very 
few cases indeed. Several children usually had two or three schemes 
ahead of them, waiting for the finishing of what was in hand. 
To Train the Habits of S 7 
Let me sfot pretend that children did not sometimes desert their 
work, that they did not get into trouble with one another, that they 
did not need help in straightening out moral and intellectual tangles, 
that they did not lose and destroy material, that they never forgot 
to put into order rooms where they had been working. Yet when 
I consider that there were children working all over the school 
building and outside it, alone or in little groups of two or three, 
that often some of them had no mature supervision for three or four 
days except such as I could give vicariously, and that under such 
conditions only two or three times did any teacher report disorder. 
and that out of such work came fifty successful reports, and that most

of the children themselves had a deep satisfaction in their work, I 
feel justified in saying to myself, “The class in general and all 
individuals in it, with the exception of three or four, have certainly 
gained somewhat in self-direction and self-stimulation.” 
To Train the Power of Self-Judgment—Over and over a child 
had opportunity to compare his written papers and his oral reports 
with those of other children, but in steadiness of effort and speed 
of work he had no means of making such comparisons or com- 
paring himself with himself at different times. In consequence there 
was less gain than there ought to have been. A good type of a 
written record of projects will, I hope, make possible a greater 
growth in this power. . 
To Stimulate the Habit of Putting One’s Powers at the Service 
of Others—-li is my ambition to have a room in which children 
are living the sort of life that is lived in a big, wholesome family, 
with many activities going on, with varieties of temperament being 
expressed, with the members of the group living in free and friendly 
co-operation. How far was this hope realized? ‘wo or three of 
the children volunteered the remark concerning So-and-so, “Oh, he 
is very much improved,” One of the members in a public discus- 
sion said, “I think I have gained in one way: I don’t seem to be 
getting into the trouble that I used to.” In their papers concern- 
. ing the year, two or three made remarks upon the interest they felt 
in hearing about what other people in the room were doing. A fact 
that I have already mentioned concerning every one’s interest in the 
preparation of his reports to the class, speaks, I think, for the social- 
izing effect. , 
Another thing that I must consider in making my judgment of 
the year’s work is whether the children had the experiences that 
they need. People have asked, “Does not this method tend to leave 
many gaps in the pupil’s sum total of knowledge?” It does. It 
certainly does not make for a logically developed and balanced curri- 
culum from the point of view of subject-matter. But are there not 
gaps in everybody’s sum total of knowledge, however he may have 
acquired it—in the business man’s, in the college professor’s, in the 
gentle reader's? I more and more seriously believe this: that what 
we need for intelligent and satisfactory living is not so much knowl- 
edge as the power to acquire knowledge and the power to apply it. 
Habits and skill we must get. With them we can dig out for our- 
selves whatever information we may need. So I refuse to worry

because this class missed the Greek myths or the geography of 
Africa or the science of soils, But I am’ concerned as to whether 
they had types of activity that will engender needed habits and 
powers. Did they have enough excursions to build up the habit 
of demanding first-hand observation and the habit of keeping linked 
up with the world at large? Did every child perform enough experi- 
ments and handle enough material to acquire skill in manipulation 
and to establish a habit of investigation at first hand? Did he have 
sufficient chance to express himself orally before an audience and 
to express himself in writing, so that he came to feel power and 
pleasure in these forms? Did he learn to use books for pleasure 
and for study, to use them intelligently, critically, appreciatively? 
Did he learn to use pencil and brush with pleasure and purpose and 
some effectiveness? Did he become able to use common tools with 
any degree of skill: hammer, saw, plane, sewing machine, needle, 
typewriter, mimeograph, camera, tank developer, jig-saw, wood 
lathe, ball and bat? My curriculum, that is, looks somewhat like 
this: study, experiment, excursion, handwork, reading, writing, 
reports, drawing, singing, dramatic play. I give such an analyzed 
record of this year’s work for each child, omitting the things com- 
mon to all-—history, modern language, number, gymnastics, singing 
SUPERVISION 
In answer to most of the questions I have asked as to whether 
the year was thoroughly satisfactory, I must say, “No.” Part of 
the cause of the failure lies in the large size of the class. To many 
teachers, thirty-three will seem a small group. Alas; that it is so! 
For years our educational leaders have been preaching individual 
attention to individual needs. How can they expect to get it with 
a group whose numbers alone swallow the individuals? We do 
not want mass teaching; we want such teaching as a wise mother 
can give. Who ever heard of a well-mothered family of thirty or 
‘even of twenty? There was not time in an hour or so, with this 
- class of thirty-three, for the teacher to consult with all who needed 
to talk with her. This difficulty resulted in rather voluminous writ- 
ing of notes at night. Perhaps a few examples of these will show 
what type of thing took the place of the usual directing. F. had 
made a periscope and was later preparing to explain to the class 
how it operated, but the day before, on account of lack of material,

he had felt rather discouraged at the end of the hour. I found two 
small mirrors, concave and convex, and gave them to him the next 
day, with the following note: 
Dear F.: Put these little concave and convex mirrors side by side, stand- 
ing up, so that you can see yourself in them both at the same time, Put 
your face close to them. Slowly walk back from them, all the time noticing 
your reflection. What differences? What changes? Can you explain with 
drawings? Remember that the angle of incidence equals the angle of 
reflection. 
When -L. and M. were making their mimeograph they put it 
together very badly at the corners. I made a partial model of a 
half-lap joint and gave it to them with this note: 
Dear L. and M.: Here is one side of a half-lap joint. Can you see 
what you have to do to the other piece? Mark it and show it to me. What 
do you think of this as a joint for your mimeograph? 
The theatre group had given me a copy of a play they had 
written, in which a boy was arrested for a crime and brought to 
trial. They explained that they were planning to make a series 
of plays, illustrating different types of trials. (The class had been 
reading of the reforms in legal procedure made by Henry II.) 
When [ returned the play the next day I accompanied it with a 
copy of Don Quixote and this letter: 
Dear J.: You and R. are making plays of different kinds of trials. Is 
that the idea? It is a good one. I have given R. references on his mediaeval 
scene. I think your plot is a little “thin,” as we say. Read the account in 
Don Quixote, pp. 640 to 644, and see whether you don’t think that would 
make a very good play. 
Again, a partial cause of the failure to meet the requirements 
of the situation lies in the teacher’s lack of knowledge and skill. 
One teacher, I fear, cannot know well enough all the things that a 
group of even fifteen children of twelve years want to know and 
ought to know. 
We were able to get for the study of Japanese art, reported 
earlier in this article, the kind of help that seems to be needed. The 
girls applied to the art teacher for Japanese pictures and for help 
in understanding them. She put at their disposal a good collection 
and gave them three or four periods of her time in explaining the 
drawings and answering the questions. At other times the children 
studied the pictures alone, or experimented with the Japanese 
brushes or stencils, or went on with their general reading on Japan. 
Such attempts to help with a project -have not always been success- 
ful. A small group of boys who were studying wireless, for

example, came back one day and said: “We think maybe we could 
get along by ourselves. Mr. —— wants us to study the theory 
of wireless, and we don’t want to. We want to set it up and learn 
how it works, It’s all right to study the theory, only that wasn’t 
what we wanted to do.” In one other instance a teacher’s attempt 
to swing the project into what seemed to a mature person a more

thorough, logical, and educative direction, quite took the adventure 
out of the self-directed plan and entirely wrecked the scheme, so 
that the girls appealed to me to be allowed to drop it. Another 
little girl, who was trying 4o learn about the Batik process of dyeing, 
courteously refused help from a teacher, evidently enjoying the 
thrill of her own experimenting, which, by the way, eventuated in 
a considerable degree of success. It is not a teacher, in the ordi- 
nary sense of the term, that is needed, but a consulting specialist. - 
I believe that a faculty could be organized to help and to help 
in the spirit of the individual project. Let me submit here a sug- 
gested plan given by another member of this faculty. It was made 
without much deliberation and because of lack of time has had no 
further consideration. Yet it seems quite possible and very stimulat- 
ing and promising. Let there be for the elementary school several 
special teachers of specialized- knowledge—drawing and painting, 
nature study, geography, history, physical and chemical science, clay- 
modeling, carpentry, metal-working, printing, photography, sewing, 
cooking. Let each of these teachers be in charge of a room well 
equipped for the pursuit of his special subject. Let it be the busi- 
ness of each of these people, not to teach, but to give help to those 
seeking it. During any time of the day children from all the 
elementary school might be free to go, with the consent of their class 
teachers, to one or another of these rooms with their varied indi- 
vidual projects, to ask for advice or to use equipment. If congestion 
resulted, certain hours could be left for children of primary grades, 
others for people of middle grades, still others for older children. 
Would not work under such conditions—choosing one’s own subject, 
directing one’s self, going at one’s own speed, yet finding it pos- 
sible to get expert help and advice when one needed them—would 
not work under such conditions be satisfying to. the soul? Would 
it not tend to train such individuals as the world needs? 
Whether any causes of failure exist in the exigencies of the 
method we cannot know, surely, until it has been tried by various 
teachers under various conditions, and until it has been done with 
one group of children through several years. For this is a method 
of living and of growing, a matter not of one isolated year, but of 
interlinking and mutually correcting years. 
The question is often asked, “Is this method possible in schools 
of the ordinary type with the usual conditions?” I should think 
not. But neither is any other fundamentally right teaching, for

are not the three great fundamental needs in our common schools 
today more space, smaller classes, more educational material? Any 
other reforms seem like mere salves applied to a sore resulting from 
a disorder of the blood. Two big rooms for every class, one for 
quiet work and one for noisy work. Carpenter tools and lumber, 
printing press, typewriters, a mimeograph, a sewing machine, a stove 
and kitchen utensils, a sand table, running water, Bunsen burners, 
clay, plaster, plenty of paper and cardboard and crayons and paints 
and scissors and books and pictures, an aquarium, and a sinking 
fund for iacidental purchases. Freedom to let children use these 
things and to lead them out upon excursions to fields and shops and 
museums. A free, fluid curriculum, growing with the children and 
with the conditions of the times. A faculty organized for giving 
individual attention to individual needs. Many an earnest and intel- 
ligent teacher knows that these are the inalienable rights of children, 
the indispensable and minimum prerequisites of any true education.

ADVENTURES IN CIVICS 
The following three experiments in teaching problems of citizen- 
ship are surely similar to those conducted in schools all over the 
country. They are recorded here simply in order to show the 
opportunities which an adaptable ‘curriculum and schedule provide 
for the intensive study of certain subjects,—subjects which are of 
timely interest but which are charged also with a permanent sig- 
nificance and which possess educational value. The study of such 
problems may lead to an understanding of community life and 
government which is as unified and. inclusive as that developed 
through the average consecutive course in civics. It may, more- 
over, through its very concreteness, leave the pupil with a more 
real sense of community experience than that which the other type 
of course would give. | 
Certain catastrophes and certain successes in our experiences, 
however, suggest a few warnings about this type of study. Prob- 
lems must be chosen very carefully. The teacher must make sure 
that the problem is tangible; that it is not too complex, or, if it is 
inevitably complex, that only a phase of it be selected for study. 
It should not be complete in itself, a carefully weighed, counted and 
crated assortment of facts. It must lead out from itself in many 
directions which might appeal to different types of mind and open 
up new avenues of exploration. In developing the study the teacher 
who keeps sensitive to group and personal interests within the class 
will gather new hints from the discussion, develop them into pos- 
sible fields to explore, change her plans as interests change, at the 
same time keeping a strong continuity of attention: upon main issues. 
As she studies the material she will find ways to train the pupils 
in different mental processes. The definite teaching of such thought 
processes, sometimes assigned arbitrarily to the labelled compart- 
ments of science, history, mathematics, literature, or composition, 
may be welded into the experience of work on one problem. The 
natural result is that the child’s thinking becomes more resourceful, 
more unified, more controlled and intelligent. 
The whole educational value of the subject is often not dis- 
covered until the experiment is well under way. In the last of the 
instances here described this was particularly true. The subject 
46
-P-A-G-E-50
Stupres in Epucation 47 
expanded amazingly with the actual work. It was undertaken with 
the hope that six weeks of work upon it would be worth while. The 
initial problem alone consumed six weeks and made the focus for 
the work of the entire remainder of the year. 
Nore—As the Morning Exercises are frequently referred to in this 
article, the following explanatory paragraph from Studies in Education, 
Volume Il; The Morning Exercise as a Socializing Influence, is reprinted 
here. 
“The Morning Exercise of the Francis W. Parker School is the daily 
assembly of the whole school. It differs from the usual chapel exercise in 
that it is fundamentally social in purpose. The exercises grow out of the 
daily work of the school, or out of the interest of the children in some large, 
absorbing, outside question. They are usually the culmination of some line 
of study. The subject is sometimes science, the telling or illustrating of 
nature observations; the story of some visit to the farm, the art gallery or 
workshop; history, current events; the massing of the literature and music 
of some special subject or special day; the telling of stories that delight the 
children’s hearts; or the discussion of some problem of vital significance in 
the community life of this school.” 
I. ON BECOMING A CITIZEN-~SEVENTH GRADE 
The seventh grade was studying the idea of a world state. 
In the discussion of the Roman Empire the problems of citizenship 
—the requirements, duties and privileges which it entailed—-led the 
interest of the children one day to the more immediate problem of 
citizenship in the United States. They decided to find out all they 
could at home that evening about how one becomes a citizen in this 
country. The next day this fragmentary information was brought 
before the group, and after they had taken stock of it together, 
new plans were made for getting fuller information. 
A group of the children who were particularly interested in the 
question visited the Naturalization Court in the Federal Building. 
They organized and presented to the class a report in the form of a 
scene in the court, which so interested the class that they decided 
to form their own naturalization court. The whole subject was 
taken up from the point of view of the real problems of different 
kinds of people, not from the more allegorical point of view which 
starts with the abstract idea and clothes it in a garment of concrete 
illustration. Each child chose to impersonate some fictitious person 
wishing to become an American citizen. Copies of the government 
* blanks for the first and second papers were secured, and each one 
filled in the information demanded in the application for citizenship,
-P-A-G-E-51
48 Francis W. ParKER ScHOOL 
consulting the necessary references to make his statements accurate. 
The special cases demanded knowledge of a variety of laws. For 
instance, the problem of the Chinaman demanded consideration dif- 
tering widely from that of the Italian. The illiterate, the dependent, 
the man who had let the time limit of his first papers expire, and 
a number of other cases were represented. 
The court sat when and where it could. The ofhdials were 
changed often so that many members of the class might have the 
- opportunity to hear and judge cases. From time to time three or 
four children simply left their other work (for the practicability 
of this plan see the article on the Project Method, in this volume), 
arranged the court, and heard the cases of the day, until every candi- 
date had been admitted to or excluded from citizenship, according 
to the Jaw. . 
The class wanted to give the experience to the school in a vivid 
way, so they decided to give a morning exercise in the form of a 
play. Together they worked out a rough plan. Choosing the scenes 
they cared to work on, they formed four groups to write the four- 
scene play on the basis of the general plan all had accepted. Two 
of these groups met with teachers; the other two did their work 
alone. When it was done, the class met, read the whole play, and 
made the needed revisions; parts were then assigned. There were 
only two rehearsals before the class gave the play for the school. ° 
The speeches were not actually memorized, because by this time the 
children were so familiar with their material that, with the plan in 
mind, they could go ahead with a more spontaneous presentation. 
The only part in the play in which the actors were dependent upon 
memorized speeches was the part in which a would-be citizen, igno- 
rant of the English language, explained her situation in her “native” 
French tongue.’ 
The four scenes of the play were: a discussion in the street 
between a newly made citizen and an alien on the values of United 
States citizenship; the issuing of first papers in the Federal Build- 
ing; the filing of the second paper in the naturalization office; and 
the Naturalization Court, in which a number of persons took the 
oath and received their certificates of citizenship. In this last scene 
the United States flag hanging over the judge’s desk, the use of the 
official school seal in stamping the documents, the dignified observ- 
ance of court ceremonial, the earnestness of the people on the stage, 
and their freedom in the use of fact, made the audience feel the
-P-A-G-E-52
Srupizs in EpucaTIon 49 
dignity and the reality of the occasion. 
Since there was no rigid time-limiting schedule in the seventh 
grade to hamper the freedom of the work, it is difficult to estimate 
the exact time spent on the naturalization subject. It ran along 
intermittently for perhaps two months. During most of that time 
there was only an occasional half-hour session of the court for exam- 
ination and issuing of certificates. Now and then, when need arose, 
the class spent a longer time writing the judge’s speech, hearing 
new facts gathered by somebody, writing the scenes of the play 
and rehearsing.

When a morning exercise elicits questions from everywhere 
in the assembly, as this one on Germany’s government did, and 
when the questions are answered by the class giving the exercise 
as well as from everywhere in the assembly, and when additional 
information is voluuteered by teachers or older pupils, we are dis- 
posed to think that the exercise has been satisfactory from the point 
of view of social service. The stenographic report which follows, 
of the eighth grade morning exercise on the imperial government 
of Germany (given in 1917, long before the collapse of this govern- 
ment) shows the brisk exchange of question and answer at the 
close, an indication that the school valued the information which 
the class was trying to give. 
Work on this subject was undertaken with the idea of substi- 
tuting patriotism for jingoism, by giving American boys and girls 
certain facts from which they themselves could make deductions. 
Of the importance of understanding the German government, as 
far as one can understand a government not his own, I need say 
nothing. But to indicate the children’s appreciation of this impor- 
tance, I think the following fact is not irrelevant. Just as we had 
finished the study, we were opportunely asked to present our infor- 
mation in a morning exercise. The class divided the subject into 
nine parts, and arranged theselves in groups of two or three. The 
general form of statement, “If in America” such and such a thing 
were true, “that would not be democratic,” was of course agreed 
upon before the groups went to work separately. They worked in 
these groups for one forty-minute period in the endeavor to make 
their points clear, and—this is the part I thought illuminating—in 
every case but one the statement submitted by the group was used
-P-A-G-E-53

in the morning exercise, with only very minor changes. . 
This comparative accuracy of information, after a very limited 
amount of study in which no papers had been written and no text 
used, is due certainly to the eagerness of the class to know about 
German government. Earlier in the year they had read and studied 
Mr. Wilson’s reply to the Pope’s peace note. They had selected, 
as the pivotal idea in this paper, the statement’ that we cannot take 
the word of the “present German government” because it is not a 
democratic government. In order to discover what Mr. Wilson 
meant by a democratic government, they had made a careful study 
of our constitution, its history as well as its content. Then they 
were eager to study the German government and find out what an 
autocracy was. The teacher knew of no available text. (She would 
now have used the pamphlet on the subject issued by the War 
Information Bureau: The Government of Germany, by Hazen.) 
The study had to be done, therefore, almost entirely from the chil- 
dren’s questions. The class used its previous knowledge of the 
American constitution as a basis for comparison. The whole matter 
of preparation for this exercise occupied not more than three periods, 
an indication that the interest was keen and the intelligence active, 
and that the children’s information, though gained in a very short 
time, was accurate and usable. 
AUTOCRACY AND DEMOCRACY-—-A MORNING EXERCISE 
John, Americans believe in democracy. Ours is a government of the 
people, by the people, for the people. The Declaration of Independence says, 
“All men are created equal.” For this principle our young men are giving 
their lives, America does not like war. President Wilson said: “It is a 
fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, the most terrible 
and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. 
But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the thing 
that we have always carried nearest to our hearts, for democracy.” 
As everybody knows, in August the President wrote a reply to the Pope's 
peace note, In this famous reply he said that we cannot fight this war again; 
that the status quo ante bellum, which the Pope proposes to return to, is not 
a basis for lasting peace; that it would merely give Germany time to 
recuperate; that the test of every plan for peace is: is it based upon the 
faith of all the people involved?—and finally, that we cannot take the word 
of the present German government. This was the President’s famous 
answer to the Pope’s peace note. We cannot take the word of Germany 
because it is not the word of the German people. This morning we are 
endeavoring to tell what we mean when we say that the word of the German 
government is not the word of the German people. In other words, we are
-P-A-G-E-54
Stupres in Epucation 51 
endeavoring to tell what autocracy is. It was because we wished to know 
what autocracy meant, that we studied the German government, and we 
thought that you, who are all loyal Americans, would. like to understand 
it, too, 
Alexis. If in America the governors of the state were governors by 
divine right, this would be as it is in Germany, and would not be democratic. 
If these governors, who were chosen by God, made a constitution without 
referring it to the people, this would not be democratic. In America, however, 
this was not the case. The framers of the constitution were elected by the 
people, and after the constitution was drafted, it was put before the people 
to vote on. This was democratic. In Germany the people who made the 
constitution were not elected or appointed by the people, but were chosen 
by divine right, and after they had made the constitution the people were 
made to abide by it without any voice in the matter whatsoever. 
Juniata, If, according to this constitution, the governor of New York 
would always be the President of the country, that would not be democratic. 
However, this is the case in Germany, for according to the constitution the 
King of Prussia is always the Emperor of Germany. Prussia has, to be 
sure, three-fifths of the population of Germany, the greatest part of the 
wealth, and all the large cities. 
Marion. The governor and legislature of New York are elected by 
direct, popular, secret ballot. This is, of course, very democratic, This, 
however, is not the case in Prussia. If, in the state of New York, four 
percent of the population, only the very wealthy people, had one-third of the 
votes, while eighty-five percent, the poor people, had only one-third of the 
votes, that would be very undemocratic. That is how it has been in Prussia. 
The rich man’s vote counted twenty times as much as the poor man’s. The 
German Junkers are few but very rich, and their votes count as much as 
all the common people’s votes. 
Charles. Ii in America only the millionaires of New York City were 
appointed to represent the New York people in the Senate, this would be 
very undemocratic. In Germany the King of Prussia, namely the Kaiser, 
appoints only Prussian Junkers to represent Prussia in the Bundesrat. If in 
America only the millionaires of New York State were appointed by the 
President to his cabinet, it would be very undemocratic. In Germany the 
Kaiser appoints only Prussian Junkers to his cabinet; also, the highest 
officers of the army and navy are Junkers. 
. If in New York State only a few men owned almost all the land and 
controlled almost all the votes, it would be very undemocratic. In Prussia 
the Junkers own most of the Jand and control almost all of the votes. They 
are responsible for the militarism and jingoism of Germany, and they are 
the ones that have stood for a powerful army and navy. 
Catherine. If in America the House of Representatives were the only 
house elected by the people, that would not be democratic. In Germany the 
Reichstag is the only house elected by direct popular vote, by secret ballot. 
It has great influence but no real power. If in America the House of Repre- 
sentatives were not paid, that would not be democratic. In Germany the
-P-A-G-E-55
52 Francis W. PARKER SCHOOL 
Reichstag has voted over and over again that its members be paid, but this 
bill has always been defeated by the Bundesrat, which is dominated by 
Prussian Junkers. If in America the State of New York bad more than 
half the members of the House of Representatives, that would not be fair 
to the rest of the country. In Germany, Prussia has 238 of the 397 members 
of the Reichstag. . 
Lisette. It is necessary for me to compare England and Germany instead 
of the United States and Germany. lf in England the Prime Minister were 
chosen by the king instead of by the people, this would uot be democratic. 
In Germany the Chancellor is chosen by the Kaiser. Up to the present 
time the Chancellors of Germany have always been Junkers, but at present 
von Hertling of Bavaria is the Chancellor. 
Carter. If in England the Prime Minister repeatedly brought a bilt 
before the House of Commons, and they repeatedly refused to pass this bill, 
and the Prime Minister yet retained his position, this would not be demo- 
cratic. This is the case in Germany. In England if the Prime Minister 
presents a bill to the House of Commons, and they refuse to pass the bill, 
Parliament is dissolved and a new election takes place. This is called 
parliamentary responsibility. Some people think England is more demo- 
cratic than America because of its parliamentary responsibility. 
Maxine. If we had class distinctions, such as there are in Germany, 
between the Junkers, middle class, and peasants, it would be very undemo- 
cratic. The Junkers are wealthy land owners who hire the peasants to work 
for them, and they pay these peasants very poor wages. If a person is born 
a peasant he cannot become a member of a higher class. Caste is every- 
where, It rules in education, and especially in politics. Official rank has an 
authority in Germany not to be found in any other country. 
Carl. If in America the President were the autocratic ruler of three- 
fifths of the United States, it would not be democratic. In Germany the 
Kaiser has almost complete autocratic rule over Prussia, which is three- 
fifths of Germany. The Kaiser has his office by divine right. In America 
the President has command of the army and navy during his four-year 
term. In Germany, however, the Kaiser has command of the army and navy 
for life. 
Edward. We have tried to point out to you some of the features of 
autocracy. We have left out some matters such as the unfair electoral vote, 
which we do not know much about. We have tried to show you, also, how 
the Reichstag has really no power, and that the Bundesrat, which is not 
elected by the people, really controls legislation. We have shown that 
Prussia controls Germany, and that the Kaiser and the Junker class control 
Prussia. It is certainly not very democratic to have a Kaiser who rules by 
divine right, or is chosen by God. If there are any questions, we will try 
to answer them. 
Question, What is the secret ballot? 
Eighth Grader. The man in casting his vote does not give it to anybody 
openly, but slips it into a box without anyone else having seen jit. We have 
the secret ballot in all our elections.
-P-A-G-E-56
Strupres in Epucation 53 
Question. What is the difference between Germany and Prussia? 
Eighth Grader. Prussia is one of the states of Germany. 
Question. What is a Junker? 
High School Boy. A Junker is a nobleman. They are all called Junkers 
if they are worth a certain sum of money and own a large area of land. It 
is a hereditary position. A man cannot be a peasant and rise to be a Junker. 
Junker means “young nobleman.” 
Eighth Grader. 1 forgot to say that although we call Germany auto- 
cratic, in"some ways it is like a democracy. The government takes care 
of the poorer classes a great deal better than we do. 
Question. You say the Kaiser rules over three-fifths of Germany. Who 
controls the other two-fifths? 
Eighth Grader. The other two-fifths comprise over twenty-four states. 
‘The largest of these is Bavaria, and then comes Saxony, and then a number 
of smaller ones. 
Question. Doesn’t the Kaiser rule all these states? 
Eighth Grader. The Kaiser rules all Germany. But each state has a 
king or duke or grand duke, so the Kaiser does not have autocratic rule in 
any state but Prussia. 
Question. Are there other rulers that rule by divine right, as in 
‘Germany? 
Eighth Grader. Japan. 
Question. Is the Reichstag in Germany the same as our Congress in 
Washington? 
Eighth Grader. The Reichstag is more like our House of Representa- 
tives, because it represents the people—or at least it is supposed to—but its 
power is very weak. They have no parliamentary responsibility. The 
Bundesrat is more like our Senate: that is, its members come from the 
different states. But our Senate is elected by the people, while the members 
of the Bundesrat are appointed by the rulers of their respective countries. 
Twenty members come from Prussia and are appointed by the Kaiser. It 
takes only fourteen votes to defeat any change in the constitution, so the 
Kaiser can prevent the Reichstag from making Germany more democratic. 
Wit. A WAR POEM 
The same class agreed to try to write a poem which should 
_express what Americans were thinking about the war. Their 
product follows: 
The gauntlet of battle is flung at our feet; 
We march with high purpose the challenge to meet. 
We shame not our fathers of yore. 
More precious than peace are Justice and Right. 
Let our country help win them by blood and by might, 
For this is a war to end war.
-P-A-G-E-57
54 Francis W. Parker SCHOOL - 
‘The people are shouting all over the world, 
“Let tyranny down from its dark throne be hurled, 
For Liberty’s sake evermore.” 
Our banners are flung full to the wind— 
And well may they tremble, those who have sinned— 
For this is a war to énd war. 
Nor treasure nor land for ourselves shall we take; 
We fight as one champion for all mankind's sake, 
That Justice may rule evermore. 
No longer can patience the trial endure; 
We fight Freedom’s battle to make peace secure— 
_For this is a war to end war. 
Obviously, it is not because of the high quality of the verse that 
I consider this piece of composition worthy of record and comment. 
Some of the children were very proud of it. “I thought it 
would be sung all over the world,” one of them said, and many 
of the children frankly avowed that it was the “best war poem 
they had read.” But there were of course other children of fine 
natural taste, careful home and school training in appreciation, and 
dawning power of expression, who knew that there were poems 
more beautiful than theirs. From the teacher’s point of view, the 
-work had value quite aside from the quality of the final product. In 
the first place, the eagerness and earnestness with which the children 
undertook so novel a task was gratifying. Their spirit was’ one of 
pride in their Americanism, fairly free from jingoism. 
It was interesting to see the use they made of work in other 
subjects. They had studied President Wilson’s reply to the Pope’s 
peace plea. The issue, democracy against autocracy, was getting its 
somewhat shadowy outline defined in their minds by the careful 
comparison they were making of the American with the German 
constitution, and they studied eagerly, for help in ideas and expres- 
sion, all quotations that were given them from President Wilson’s 
addresses. 
As all teachers know, there is a limit to the time which can 
profitably be spent upon such a piece of work; still we did give 
several lessons to it. We first agreed upon a first line and a rhyme 
scheme. The interest of the children was evinced by the fact that 
they kept the task in mind after this initial step, and brought in new
-P-A-G-E-58
Srupres 1n Epucation 55 
lines as they worked them out. The lines we rejected—much more 
numerous, of course, than those we kept—were rejected generally 
because the idea had been better expressed by some one else. When 
we had finished the verses, a small volunteer group, working with 
the music teacher, made a melody for them. 
Iv, A COURSE 1N CIVICS AND ENGLISH---NINTH GRADE. 
When school opened in September, 1917, the subject of the 
war and our country’s share in it appeared perpetually in the con- 
versation of the ninth grade. Summer experiences were exchanged 
—watching troop trains pass daily, visiting one of the big camps, 
talking with a draft board official, seeing a brother off to France. A 
day or two of general discussion resulted in a long list of questions 
about our part in the war. Partly because most of the children’s 
interest and their fragmentary glimpses of army organization, and 
partly because, having worked in a draft board office during the 
summer, I was convinced that there was much in the subject to 
interest high school people, we undertook as our first problem the 
Selective Service Act and its operation. The English and civics 
courses were combined, making a total of seven periods a week, and 
the two teachers planned the course together. In mingling the two 
subjects one had to watch carefully lest the interest of the one sub- 
ject crowd out the qualities which are essential to work in the other. 
One had to make certain that there should be good reading and 
definite training in the elements of composition. 
We started out with a brief analysis of the main features of 
the law itself. Two groups reported on the compulsory military 
service schemes of France and Germany. Then we decided to have 
our own drait board. Securing sample blanks from a local board, 
we named a registration hour, and each child chose to represent 
some one within the registration requirements. We chose our local 
board on a rotating scheme, so that most of the class members 
served at one time or another. 
When the registration was complete, the local board shuffled 
the blanks and gave them their “red ink” or serial numbers. A 
group undertook the drawing of the “call” numbers in Washington, 
and the cards were renumbered in “call” order by the local board. 
The board was then ready for the filing of exemption claims, and 
the registrants were summoned. Each registrant was expected to 
study his own situation thoroughly, in the light of the regulations,
-P-A-G-E-59
56 Francis W. Parker Scuooi 
and to fill out his own papers, with the privilege of consulting the 
local board or the teacher. We found that our group included, 
besides those who made no-claim for exemption, the allied alien, 
the neutral alien, the enemy alien, the declarant, a variety of depend- 
ency cases, and several who, because they were involved in govern- 
ment service or necessary industries, were exempt from military 
service. A few of the children visited local boards in their neigh- 
borhoods, and others sought advice about their cases from officials 
with whom they were acquainted. After the exemption affidavits 
had been filed, the board met and discussed the cases, calling in 
all the doubtful ones for conference before a decision was made. 
The most difficult cases to decide were the dependency ones, and a 
rather sketchy attempt was made to work out a minimum budget 
for individuals and for families, as an aid in fair decision. The 
result, compounded from questioning a few families living under- 
different economic conditions, and from finding out prices of essen- 
tial commodities, was more suggestive than it was accurate. 
‘The report of the board to the class suggested a morning exer- 
cise, which was later given:.a careful explanation to the school of 
the workings of the draft, followed by the presentation of a scene 
in a local board office when registrants were summoned to present 
or waive their exemption claims. Discussion in the class carried 
us over to a brief study of the conditions which were met by the 
local board with which I had been working. This immigrant district, 
with twelve thousand registrants crowded into approximately one 
square mile, including a large percentage of aliens of many national- 
ities, with an imperative dependency claim attached to almost every 
' case, challenged the class to serious thinking. Here are a few of 
the questions they formulated: Why are certain sections of the 
city desperately overcrowded, and what is the effect of this crowd- 
ing upon the families living there? Why is it that immigrants are 
usually living in these districts? Do the immigrant American 
soldiers know what they are fighting for? Is a person really Amer- 
ican when he has been sworn in as a citizen? How can we make 
America’s ideals clear to immigrants? What has America to offer 
them? What are America’s ideals, anyway? How did these ideals 
come to be formulated? What has made people in Europe, ever 
since 1492, want to leave their homes and come to America? Does 
the word “American” mean the type of the early colonist or that 
of the more recent immigrant? What are the privileges and the
-P-A-G-E-60
Srupres 1n Epucation 57 
obligations of citizenship in the country? 
Gradually the course centered about two big subjects: migra- 
tions to America, and the development of democracy in America. 
We started with a very brief review of the voyages of discovery 
and exploration—-a subject which had been studied in earlier grades. 
Then for almost three months we studied certain colonial groups: 
the Pilgrims, the Puritans, the Cavaliers, and the Dutch. Why did 
these people come to America? How did they have to alter their 
mode of living in America? What did America give to them? 
What did they give to-America? This demanded a good deal of 
delving into history, for it was our aim to base the discussion, not 
upon guesswork but upon definite information, and to emphasize 
the need of accurate thought and statement. Perhaps it is too 
‘great a problem to set before people with so little historical back- 
ground. The chief aim of this work, however, and of our later 
work, lay in the attempt to make it possible for the children to 
become aware of certain great truths, the special worth and con- 
tribution to our national life of people of different nationalities ; the 
responsibility a democracy must assume in protecting and extending 
its liberty and justice; the struggle toward democracy here and in 
the European countries whence many of our citizens come; the 
loyalty of many of these new citizens to America as it is shown in 
their active, responsible citizenship; the responsibility of America 
now and in the future toward the growth of democracy in the 
world. : 
Out of the colonial study the problem of the negro and his 
relation to the national life emerged, and several weeks were spent 
in studying this and certain facts of the reconstruction period at 
the close of the Civil War. This work brought out the bad effects 
of extreme party feeling, the inability of a race to acquire an 
intelligent sense of responsibility over night, and the duty of the 
nation to educate such a group toward citizenship. 
The last three months were spent on recent immigrations to 
America. After a brief study of the early nineteenth century move- 
ments of groups of Germans, British, and Scandinavians toward 
this country, the tremendous influx of foreigners after 1880 was 
taken up in greater detail: the proportions and distribution of the 
different nationalities; the reasons for their coming; the present 
immigration law and regulations ; the organizations in Chicago which 
help to secure protection and employment; the types of work
-P-A-G-E-61

. 7usually done by immigrants. 
This may sound like the outline of a college seminar course, 
and introducing it into the first year of high school may seem an 
utter absurdity. But the reader must of course realize that the 
whole thing was carried on in a manner much more child-like and 
fragmentary and concrete than these terms imply. Nevertheless, 
thorough work in the reading of difficult books was certainly done. 
Through this work, moreover, the use of reference books and of 
the library was learned. The necessity of taking notes in clear, 
reduced form, and of putting in order scraps of information 
from various sources, showed the value of the topical outline, 
the principles of which were learned and put into service at 
the beginning of the year. A number of stories were written 
about colonial life, and a Pilgrim play, portraying the life of 
a Pilgrim family in Holland and in Massachusetts, was written 
and presented, Stories, diaries, and descriptions were written 
about immigrants of today. A morning exercise on the draft— 
described earlier in this article—was given. A rough map show- 
ing the chief foreign districts of Chicago was made on the basis 
of our own wanderings about the city. Editorials were com- 
posed, urging increased or decreased restriction of immigration, 
demanding training in citizenship, or explaining American ideals 
to the newcomer. The subject was rich in suggestive material 
for varied forms of composition. 
The reading was of three sorts: exposition, description, and 
folk literature. The first kind included such books as govern- 
ment reports and selected parts of American History and Its Geo- 
graphic Conditions (Semple), and Our Slavic Fellow-Citizens 
(Balch). The second kind included- certain magazine articles 
and vivid, true, descriptive books (by Riis, Steiner, Antin, and 
others). The third type of reading, which I suppose would 
qualify more surely as “literature,” started out with folk poems 
and stories of the nations some of whose people are rapidly becom- 
ing Americans: Irish fairy tales, Russian- and Norse legends, The 
Bard of the Dimbovitza (Rowmanian) and a few others; this was 
followed by reading decided upon entirely by the teachers, with only 
the mild approval of the pupils, who urged more “modern stuff.” 
It consisted of a rather thorough study of English and Scotch 
ballads, and the reading by each child of one of the longer epics— 
the Odyssey, the Iliad, Beowulf, the Song of Roland, or Morris’
-P-A-G-E-62
Srupizs 1n Epucation 59 
Sigurd the Volsung. Some of the written work was based on this 
reading. There was a good deal of discussion—initiated by the 
pupils, whose interest had somehow revived—about folk literature 
and its place in the life of a people. 
We have found that the chief dangers of this type of course 
are that the children may become content with superficiality, may 
think they know what they do not know, may be unable to organize 
scattered units in their minds, or may in some other way struggle 
with the discouragement of tackling work far beyond their capacity. 
We tried to meet these dangers by selecting a few significant units 
from the mass of material, and by insisting upon thorough, accurate 
studying. Although the main course of action had to be determined 
from week to week by the teachers, we tried to keep it from becom- 
ing rigid or alien to the interests of the group, by following up the 
problems, which arose in their minds as well as the ones that 
occurred to us as interesting. 
I realize that it would be difficult to attempt a piece of work 
of this sort unless certain conditions favored freedom of experiment, 
but I believe that teachers everywhere should work toward obtain- 
ing conditions that make possible a certain amount of freedom and 
adaptation. of their work to special needs. The only “outside” 
requirements which we had to meet were those for college entrance, 
which we covered in the course without too great a deviation from 
our special lines of interest. Our schedule was the usual unbending 
high school schedule, but occasional study periods were used for 
group work. There were two sections of the class, one numbering 
fifteen and the other twenty-two pupils. Each section was some- 
times divided into groups of four or five members to do a speciai 
piece of work for the class. Sometimes these groups met with the 
teacher ; sometimes they worked independently. At times the teacher 
‘met only with the chairman of the groups, giving them suggestions 
for directing the work of, the groups. The groups met anywhere 
and everywhere: in vacant rooms, which could rarely be found; 
in the hall; or on the landing, when no other space was available. 
Sometimes a group was formed by the teacher on the basis of spe- 
cial needs, for extra training in outlining or organizing a report or 
reviewing a difficult subject. Frequent individual conferences helped 
to achieve good workmanship, to clear cloudy understanding, to 
start fresh interest. In fact, without the opportunity of doing a 
certain amount of work with individuals and small groups, it seems
-P-A-G-E-63
60 Francis W. PARKER SCHOOL 
to me difficult to maintain in any group of pupils a sturdy vitality 
and independence of thought and a sense of thoroughness and fine- 
ness of technique. 
Always we tried to make it possible for the people in the class 
to see for themselves the life lived by human beings, rather than 
to memorize abstract conclusions. We tried to make it possible for 
them to realize some of the actual relations between actual human 
beings and their government, to gain a greater understanding of the 
many peoples who all together make up present-day America, to 
become aware of the legend and literature that have grown out of 
the life of nations in the making, to realize the necessity of a sound 
basis for judgment and of good workmanship in thinking, and to 
begin to form a point of view about community problems which 
will help them to become intelligent citizens. 
Perhaps the most immediate reason for the existence of a 
course of this sort—and its inherent values are latent also in much 
of the unrealized material of history and daily experience and liter- 
ature—is the arrangement of the average high school curriculum, 
At the age of fourteen, when ideals form and change rapidly, many 
school children—-at least those who are working toward college— 
are spending the greater part of their time in studying subjects 
which offer “mental discipline,” the training of memory, abstract 
logic, and individual skill, rather than social understanding. Work 
in foreign languages seems to be at this stage largely a technical 
matter of grammar and vocabulary. This, with the required mathe- 
matics, consumes about two-thirds of the children’s study time. 
Until this condition be changed, is it not imperative that the remain- 
ing one-third shall be full of rich content which will expand the 
horizon of human experience and quicken the imagination? 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
MEN OF SERVICE 
Our children are interested in the deeds of the great men 
and women of history because of the stirring things accom- 
plished, the dangers encountered, the good triumphant over evil, 
the struggle against odds, and the reward that crowns per- 
severance. To teach children to choose rightly, to judge reason- 
ably, and to want to put into practice what they learn, is possible 
when it is done concretely in regard to matters that touch their 
lives closely and stir strong motives of interest. If they have 
the concrete details from which to picture vividly the events, 
they can understand the situations as though they had actually 
lived through the experiences themselves. : 
What history is of most worth? That which comes most 
closely into relation with the pupils’ own conduct. How much 
does the study of history influence what the pupils do and think? 
The lives of great men afe like the drama on the stage. We 
are interested in the plot; the difficulties gain our sympathies ; 
the success or failure wins our applause or disapproval. Through 
seeing evil in action, without ourselves becoming involved in it, 
we can develop the strength to resist evil. We learn to admire 
the right and the good. We gain experience in judging char- 
acter, in choosing whom we will follow. Many children pattern 
their lives after the heroes or heroines they have in their minds, 
who have become to them the aim and ideal for which to strive 
and sacrifice. 
History furnishes us with perspective to see things in their 
true relations and proper proportions. Its study takes us out of 
the petty trifles of everyday life into the consideration of great, 
significant issues. One of the purposes of studying biography 
is to learn how an individual gets on with his fellowmen, how 
he influences them, how he yields to necessity, how he over- 
comes obstacles, how he follows ideals, and how his life counts 
in advancing the common Jot of mankind. The human will is 
the essential characteristic of each individual being. The will 
is the ego. Hence, in dealing with people, whether children or 
adults, the chief problem is to strengthen, enlighten, and socialize 
the human will. History should furnish the stimulus to visions 
61
-P-A-G-E-65
62 ‘Francis W. ParKEeR SCHOOL 
of ideals that may become the controlling motives of later life. 
Many a pupil is stirred tothe adoption of ideas and purposes by 
“the Vision of the world and all the wonder that would be.” He 
passes in review great aims, dynamic ideas, and worthy but-still 
unachieved purposes. There is born in him a lasting resolve 
to devote his life to the accomplishment of some good and worthy 
aim, Such an influence possesses enduring effect. To choose, 
for study, character types of pregnant power is a great problem 
of the curriculum. Certain men realize great developing ideas, 
and their deeds illustrate such aims. Columbus’ idea of sailing 
west to reach the east was one of the most fruitful that we find 
in all the range of history. Captain Cook laid the foundation of 
the great British Empire, in Australasia. 
By comparison we see resemblances in the midst of striking 
contrasts. Nothing is more suggestive of new ideas than com- 
parison of situations, in order both to see wherein there are 
resemblances and also to note the differences. To train judg- 
ment it is necessary to compare events and purposes, noting 
carefully their resemblances and differences. Children reflect 
opinions of the teacher, but they nevertheless put much original- 
ity into their own opinions, for it is often easier to be original 
and inconsistent than to. apply any abstract principles con- 
sistently. I do not know of anything more interesting to young 
or old than these comparisons that illumine history and make it 
possible to understand one age or event by its likeness to another. 
History does repeat itself in never-ending variations. 
The explorations and discoveries are part of the effort of 
the human race to study the great world. The interest and the 
value of these great adventures for us today lie, not in treating 
them as isolated facts of history, but in studying them in their 
relations. Columbus’ work cannot be properly understood with- 
out learning something of Marco Polo’s and Magellan’s. While 
Washington and Lincoln were to me supermen, to whom I did 
not apply the standards of right and wrong, they had little influ- 
ence with me. It was the contrast of Napoleon with Washing- 
ton, the comparison of Roosevelt with Lincoln, that made all 
four human and intelligible as well as full of interest. Marquette 
never used to interest me much, so long as his exploration of 
the Mississippi was the chief fact I knew. Interest grew from 
the contrast between the expeditions of De Soto, Cortez,
-P-A-G-E-66
Stupies 1n EpucatTion 63 
Coronado, and Pizarro, on the one hand, with their hundreds of 
armed men going forth to conquer and exact tribute, and on the 
other hand the little band of seven Frenchmen in two bark 
canoes, with prayer-book and calumet, welcomed and feasted by 
their savage friends from Green Bay to the Arkansas. The 
former fought their way and left desolation and hatred in their 
track. The gentle and devoted Father Marquette was safer, than 
if he had had an army of ten thousand to accompany him through 
the wilderness of savage Indians. Yet the innocence and self- 
sacrifice of Fray Padilla ended in his martyrdom. La Salle 
dreamed of a great French Mississippi Valley that would have 
made [france paramount in North America. While Columbus 
had innumerable followers who have worked out his ideas in 
a great variety of ways for centuries, La Salle’s aims were 
abandoned by the French, and the dream never came true. 
_ The character of Captain John Smith shows many analogies 
and correspondences with that of Roosevelt. Both were pre- 
eminently men of action, who could get things done, whose 
careers show startling instances of good luck or happy coinci- 
dences because they were always ready to respond when fortune 
offered. They both roamed the wide world in search of adven- 
ture. They were always dominant wherever they were. They 
turned misfortune very frequently into great good fortune. They 
are both heroes whose naines will always sound stirring to the 
boys and girls of school age. 
What is it in a leader that commands the loyalty of his 
followers? The children, from their standpoint, have answered 
this question in part. It is bravery, unselfishness, kindness, and 
sympathy ; it is firmness, sincerity, and perseverance. The leader 
must be able to get things done; he must be resourceful and 
self-confident, must have commanding presence and personal 
magnetism. He must be able to decide promptly and justly, and 
not waver. Some of the leaders had bosom friends who doubled 
their effectiveness. Thus La Salle was aided by Tonti. Magellan 
was able to do much more, because of his team work with 
Francisco Serrano. Roosevelt and Taft for a time were such 
congenial spirits that both did more together than they could 
accomplish when separated. Lenine and Trotsky at present owe 
much of their success to the fact that they supplement each other 
in their abilities.
-P-A-G-E-67
64 Francis W. Parker SCHOOL 
This is the way fifth-grade children express their judgment 
of the qualities needed in a leader: 
A jeader must be brave, smart, original, and have command ovet his 
men, A. 
A leader should be brave and wise. B. 
A leader must be kind to his men. He must be able to make his men 
obey him. He must have experience to fill his position well. P. 
A leader should be true to his men, and the men should be true to 
him, . _P. 
A leader should be kind and helpful to his followers. He should be 
brave, unselfish, clear-headed, and thoughtful. F. 
A leader should be determined and not harsh to his or het followers. 
M. 
A leader must have common sense, bravery, responsibility, wisdom, and 
kindness, . M. 
A captain has to have initiative. H. 
A man that is a leader, I think, should be brave, kind, unselfish, and 
honest. L. 
I would choose a man os. woman who is brave, kind, and willing to 
risk his life for another, as my leader. FE. 
A leader should have these qualities: bravery, courage, power to make 
those under him obey him, to be strict and have determination. A. 
Very few emphasize the moral rightness of the leader’s aim 
as important: : 
The qualities a leader should have are to be brave and honest, to be 
willing to suffer for his men, always do the Tight so that his men will 
follow him, E. 
Ii I were to choose my leader I would choose a man that would not 
think of himself, but would see to do good for his followers; a man that 
is honest and brave and would stand for the truth and be educated. E. 
Some of the children named other children whom they 
would choose to follow and gave their reasons: 
Of the children in my class I would rather have F. W. for my leader, 
because he is wise and would not lead me into any place that was not 
worth going to. I would like an honest leader, and he is honest. J. 
I look forward to J. T., because I think he is kind, helpful, brave, 
unselfish, clear-headed and thoughtful. Fy 
* Out of all the class I think B. would be ‘the best leader because he is 
strong, brave, smart, and has control over his men. A. 
Here are a few answers to the question:: Whom do you 
delight to honor? 
I admire Father Marquette because he was not selfish and because he 
did not go down the Mississippi to see if it ran into the Pacific for his 
own good, but for France. He did not go down the river only to explore 
but to teach the Indians of God. gE
-P-A-G-E-68
Srupirs in EpucaTion 65 
De Soto was mean to the Indians, so that they did not like him, while 
the Indians loved Father Marquette. E. 
The reason I like Father Marquette is because he gave up his personal 
life and went through daring trips to teach the Indians. H. 
Ex-President Roosevelt is the man I most admire. Whatever he started 
to do he always finished. M. 
I admire Roosevelt for his courage, bravery, and ability to accomplish 
what he started out to do. A. 
I like Roosevelt because he had much courage and was fearless and 
brave. L. 
Even children of ten judge with decision when their minds 
are clear on the facts. It is necessary, therefore, to dwell long 
enough on the type studied in order really to appreciate it con- 
cretely. This may take weeks or even months, working with one 
great character. Generalizations get us nowhere. Most text 
books, however, contain only conclusions or general statements 
that represent the adult product of thinking. The children, on 
the other hand, need the concrete life-experiences to compare and 
pass judgment upon, in order to think. It takes longer than to 
memorize the statements that others make about the hero; but 
that which is to count in building character must reach ‘the 
emotions and stir the will to action. 
Since most of us must be followers, we should recognize the 
necessary virtues of the common man, who is not a leader at all. 
The qualities that the followers should have, some children 
stated thus: 
A person who is to be led must be obedient, brave, and steadfast. M. 
A leader’s men should not be fighting among themselves. B. 
A captain has to have initiative. The sailors have to be faithful, and 
they must want the voyage to be a success. E, 
If a leader wants to have success he has to be honest and brave, and 
his men should be of the same character, L. 
The qualities that good followers should have are braveness, faithfulness, 
and obdientness. A. 
Would the practical application of such ideas as these chil- 
dren express purify our sordid politics and make for good citizen- 
ship? Of course it is a long way from the expression of an idea 
to its carrying out. The worst feature of our community life is 
that we do not live up to the light that we have. On the other 
hand, if we start the children to thinking genuinely and judging 
frankly, we may sometime arrive at the actual realization of 
ideals.

THE LIFE OF LINCOLN 
There follow stenographic reports of the four exercises given 
in honor of Lincoln’s birthday in the last four years. The com- 
position and presentation represent the outcome of six weeks’ 
work on the life of Lincoln, from January 1 to February 12 each 
year. I believe that any teacher, reading these exercises, can 
see that the children wrote with genuine feeling from a relatively 
large fund of information, such as.can be gained by concentra- 
tion upon one subject in all its phases for a considerable period. 
Their study was partly actuated by the knowledge that the 
school looked to them for the observance of Lincoln’s birthday, 
one of the three important patriotic exercises of the year. Six 
weeks is of course a very short time for so grave an undertaking 
but it-is long enough—when history, literature, reading, com- 
position, drawing, are all directed toward the one end—for every 
pupil to build up a picture of what American democracy meant 
on ‘the western frontier, and a fair conception of how the evil 
of slavery grew until civil war seemed the only solution. It is 
long enough to enable the pupils, at the end, when they come to 
plan their exercise, to write genuinely from loving admiration 
of Lincoln, based on some knowledge, to write with relative 
power because their feeling is strong, and to write simply because 
they have studied and admired simplicity. It is long enough 
for the spontaneous growth of moral judgments from the con- 
templation of moral genius such as Lincoln’s, lighted as it is by 
modesty and humor. The pupils compare him irresistibly with 
his cabinet, his generals, his fellow frontiersmen, his father, with 
Douglas, with Everett, with the leaders of our own great time. 
The flexibility of curriculum, discussed elsewhere in this. 
volume, permits the teacher to take from environment and cur- 
rent events the material in which her pupils have a special inter- 
est, an interest which gives them a leverage for intensive work. 
It permits her also, as I intimated above, to use every period of 
every day, if necessary, to intensify the meaning of the subject, 
through literature, oral expression, written composition, drawing, 
history, geography—in short, through every form of expression 
and every avenue of impression. Correlative to this flexible 
66
-P-A-G-E-70
STUDIES IN EDUCATION 67 
curriculum in aiding a teacher to do her best for her pupils is 
freedom from departmental work. Another great advantage is 
a flexible daily program. If Robert’s first remark when school 
opens is, “It’s only a little more than a week to Lincoln’s birth- 
day, and we haven’t even talked about what our exercise shall 
be,” the teacher can say, “Very well, what’s your idea?” And 
if he has been very much impressed by the study of Pilgrim’s 
Progress and thinks we ought to write an allegory, we can all 
make suggestions for allegories, as the class did in 1916, choose 
one of them, and go to work upon it. The subject in which the 
interest is keenest, the thing for which the need is greatest, the 
material which has a right to the freshest attention, determines 
what shall begin the day. The teacher with the three advan- 
tages, a flexible curriculum, a flexible program, and a single 
group of pupils whose entire work she teaches, or supervises, is 
much to blame if she cannot aid her pupils in their moral develop- 
ment. I have spoken of giving them a basis for moral judgments. 
She should also be able to arouse and increase that courage for 
hard work, for drudgery, if you will, that is essential to useful- . 
ness in society. This is achieved more easily when the social 
motive for work is strong—as it is in planning an exercise for 
the school on Lincoln,—and when the subject is stimulating to 
the warmest hero worship and the finest love for humanity. 
Under such a stimulus, lazy, self-indulgent Jack will work two 
or three hours, after reading Vachel Lindsay’s “Abraham Lin- 
coln Walks at Midnight,” trying to write a poem of his own 
which will say that Lincoln may sleep, for America will carry 
on his work. The teacher should be able to awaken pride in 
good work without any false stimuli; habits of regular work; 
habits of intensive study and scorn of dawdling. The morning 
exercises which follow are evidence, perhaps, of hard work, will- 
ing work, and some power of moral judgment. 
I. 
The eighth grade of 1916 chose to write an allegory, because 
Pilgrim’s Progress had especially interested them. They each 
made one or more suggestions, of which a few follow. Of these 
we chose one, and the class worked it out together.

SUGGESTIONS FOR ALLEGORIES ABOUT LINCOLN 
The North and South as a chain; this chain broken by slavery; the 
chainsmith, Lincoln, welding the chain together; the things that hindered 
him, such as a poor fire, bad tools, ete. W. 
We might call it a ship, tossed on the seas, and have barnacles represent 
the slaves, who are gluing themselves to the ship and gradually sinking it, 
and have Lincoln be the captain, who is arranging everything. Or, have a 
boy who is heir to the throne be in some way deprived of it and later, through 
his intellect, win the hearts of the people and regain the throne. Or, we 
might have Lincoln represented by a stag, which is chased by the hounds, and 
who waits until the right time and then gores the hounds and at last becomes 
the monarch of the forest. J. 
A man, Lincoin, should be working on a bridge, and every little while 
he would encounter some difficulty. Finally, as he finished it, he would 
slip and fall, killing himself but leaving the bridge almost complete. J. 
Columbia is striving to keep from catching the sickness, slavery. A 
group of doctors, representing the Ordinance of 1787, Missouri Compromise, 
etc., come in. But finally the doctors fail, and they find that her left arm, 
the South, will have to be cut off. Then comes Lincoln and saves Columbia. 
H. 
We might picture Lincoln as a gardener, watering and taking care of 
a beautiful flower, the flower of liberty, and picture these different ordi- 
nances and compromises as weeds or snakes or other things which try to 
kill the flower. I. 
We might have Lincoln a scale-maker. One side would weigh more than 
the other, one side Liberty, the other War. M. 
We could. have a young man, representing America, struggling to gain 
a certain point and going through many experiences. At last he sees a 
shining light, representing Lincoln, who guided the young man and gave 
him power and strength to carry on his work and find the right way. This 
would show what Lincoln had done to help his country. P. 
LINCOLN-—-AN ALLEGORY 
A certain man had a great estate. And always he kept a steward over 
the estate to tend the gardens, to care for the harvests, to plant orchards and 
shade trees, to welcome all who came. 
And there came a day when he must choose a new steward. And he 
bethought himself of all the learned men and they came unto him. Many 
mighty men came, and he was sorely troubled, not knowing whom to choose. 
And there came also, out of the wilderness, a simple man in rough gar- 
ments, who had great endurance, who was patient as he was simple, loving 
as he was strong, hopeful as he was humble. So the master, though doubtful, 
decided to make trial of the tall, hard-muscled, melancholy man, and send 
the others away. “It does not give me so much pleasure as I expected,” 
said the new steward, “but do not send the others away. Though they love 
me not, they shall be my helpers.”
-P-A-G-E-72
Stupies IN EDUCATION 69 
Thereafter, whosoever traveled to this great estate saw standing within 
the gate a man of tall stature, gaunt, strong, with great hands which bore 
the mark of toil. Those that passed were wont to laugh and throw him 
taunts, but he heeded them not. He felt no pride in his high position, but 
with malice toward none strove to do well the great task before him. 
Upon a day came a curious visitor, inquiring about a great tree upon 
which the steward was earnestly gazing. “Why,” said he, “do you fix your 
gaze upon that one tree? The estate is great. There are fair flowers and 
pleasant lawns and many stately trees. Why is this one tree your chief care? 
And why is your gaze sad and anxious when you look upon it?” 
The steward turned his care-lined face to the questioner. Then his eyes 
lit with a quaint humor. He struck the tree a loving blow with his great 
hand. “Old tree,” he said, “why do I love thee?” Then turning to the 
questioner, he said, “My friend, fourscore and seven years ago our fathers 
planted that tree, that we, the people of this garden, might secure the 
blessings of liberty. It has withstood storms and the mighty power of the 
wind; when yet a tender shoot a great fire scorched it; here worms have 
eaten it; there lightning has struck it. It bears scars, bad scars, and deep 
seams. Yonder limb weights it dreadfully. But my honor defends its life. 
If that tree of liberty die, all else on the master’s estate will be worthfess. 
Without the assistance of the Divine Being it cannot survive; with that 
assistance it cannot die.” 
Often the master walked about, proudly inspecting his broad acres. And 
often the steward spoke with him anxiously concerning the tree. “This limb 
wilf be a great menace to its life in time of storm. A tree so divided cannot 
stand.” 
But the master said, “Stay, touch it not. Would that it had been 
pruned off while it was yet small. But now the branch is almost as large 
as the tree itself. If it were lopped off, I fear decay and death.” 
So the steward answered patiently, “Often a limb is amputated to save 
a life. But a life is never given wisely to save a limb. If that branch is 
not dangerous, nothing is dangerous. A bolt from the sky would split the 
tree from top to bottom. Even now in the west the sky is darkening, the 
clouds are low, and a storm must come.” 
And the storm came. The windows of heaven were opened, and the 
rain poured forth, and the terrible lightning and thunder were released. 
The owner became sorely frightened, and rushed to the steward, and was 
very wroth with him, and gave harsh orders, and ‘upbraided him. But while 
the owner in terror raged, the steward’s face was calm, though sad. With 
steady eyes he stepped firmly to the aid of his friend the tree. 
In the fury and wildness of the tempest, the tree shook wildly. The 
owner kept shouting, but the steward heard him not. He knew the danger 
and stood face to face with the storm. A flash of lightning iflumined the 
strong determined face, and the great man stood in the wild wind. By the 
blinding glare he saw more clearly that the limb must fall. “It is dangerous,” 
he said, “but we must get at that branch; we must strike it off, or the whole 
tree will go.” Amidst the fearful hurricane he pulled himself laboriously
-P-A-G-E-73
70 Francis W. Parker ScHoor 
up the tree, he struck mightily at the dangerous limb. Now that he had a 
chance to hit it, he hit it hard. Under the skilful strokes of his powerful 
ax, the branch fell. 
And though the gray form of treachery crept up behind, and brought 
death to the fearless steward, yet will the master ever hold him The First 
American, 
If. 
The eighth grade of 1917 had had a good deal of discussion 
on the question whether an American should pity Lincoln. They 
had each made a short oration to the class on some aspect of this 
matter. When they came to plan their exercise for the school, 
they recalled the best of these orations and combined them. 
Then they agreed to write an introductory paragraph based on 
Stanton’s words at Lincoln’s death bed, “Now he belongs to the 
ages.”. Every one did his best on this paragraph, and we col- 
laborated. We followed the same plan for the concluding para- 
graph; the result was that, while only four people spoke, all the 
class had aided in the composition and considered the exercise 
a piece of class work. The same is true of the other exercises.

All the long night after Booth’s hateful bullet had crashed into Lin- 
coln’s brain, men stood about the bed, grief-stricken and amazed. As the 
last feeble pulse-beat ceased and the great soul started on its journey, Stanton 
whispered, “Now he belongs to the ages.” 
Not to the West, whence he came, belongs this rail-splitter; it is not for 
the North to claim him, though he guided them through four years of 
dreadful war—no, not even the Union, which he loved more than life itself, 
can say, “He is ours,” for Lincoln belongs to the whole world, a gentle, sim- 
ple, great, kindly man of the people. Travelers tell of sceing his picture in 
the huts of Russian peasants. There must be some reason why this man, 
more than any other American, belongs to the ages,—why he is claimed by 
the simple people of the whole world. 
Frances. 
The Gettysburg Speech perhaps helps us to the reason. We love it and 
learn it, not because of its beauty, its compact unity, not even because of 
the wonderful skill which put into a three minute speech the meaning of the 
whole great struggle; not for these reasons chiefly, but because these words 
could have come from one man only. 
What gave him this power? We are wont to speak pityingly of Lin- 
coln’s childhood and early surroundings. But in that quiet forest while with 
mighty swing and sure stroke he cleft the rail, or with hoe and scythe aided
-P-A-G-E-74
Stupirs 1n EpucaTion 71 
his father to gain bread in the wilderness, there was time for great thoughts 
to grow and ripen. Can we doubt that forest and field helped to fit him for 
the great task lying before him? Can we doubt that this hard labor gave 
him respect for labor, made him unwilling that the teil of any man,” 
black or white, should be unrequited? No one was so earnest in his resolve 
“that a government of the people, by the people, for the people, should not 
perish from the earth.” Can we pity him for surroundings that gave him 
such sympathy with the common man? “I am not ashamed to confess that 
25 years ago I was a hired laborer, mauling rails, at work on a flat boat— 
just what might happen to any poor man’s son. I want every man to have 
a chance to better his condition.” Lincoln believed that all men are created 
equal; that the poor, uneducated, hard-toiling slave had a right to a chance 
to better his condition. He himself had labored hard and his sympathy went 
out to labor, and he felt as not many others did that the slave should be free. 
He trusted the people with whom he had lived and labored. “None,” he 
says, “are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty 
—none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not earned.” 
He believed that the people can rule and must rule. He says, “Why should 
there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the peoples? Is 
there any better or equal hope in the world?” The Gettysburg Speech shows 
us that because of this noble democracy, this belief in the people, Lincoln 
belongs to the ages!

Lincoin’s childhood, was that unfortunate? Surely the trip across the 
broad Ohio and into the Indian wilderness was a joy. The outdoor life 
was not a misfortune. And we cannot forget that the move from Kentucky 
to Indiana was a move from a slave state to the northwest territory where 
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude could ever exist; where the free 
man could overcome poverty by honest labor. When Lincoln quotes “All 
men are created equal,’ what does it mean? It means that where he grew 
into manhood all men were equal. No master said his servants were of a 
lower race than himself. That sturdy childhood taught the boy that all men 
are created equal. Was a childhood that could teach such a great lesson 
wholly unfortunate? 
Looking at many another boy we might say, “How unfortunate! Books 
so easy to get and so many! Schools and teachers so numerous! ‘Money so 
plentiful! Excitement so constant! Everything so easy to get except ambi- 
tion! Who is most fortunate?” 
We have said that we can scarcely think Lincoln unfortunate in his 
surroundings. His surroundings were there not to hinder but to heip him. 
Behind .each blow of his axe was the great determination to make good. 
And it was this determination to make good that at length kept the Union 
together and set the slaves free. 
Shall we say that his education was unfortunate when his hard struggle 
taught him to be self-reliant? What is education? Lincoln grew up among
-P-A-G-E-75
72 , Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
people who were poor, uneducated, and unwilling to learn. But he was 
different. Everything educated him. Close contact with his rough neighbors 
taught him to understand human nature. Can the boy who for twenty miles 
around -his home had trudged in search of books remain uneducated? Lin- 
coln was poor in material things but rich in ambition. Ambition taught him 
never to be content with what he had learned, but always to strive to learn 
more. That is education. 
Shall we say that he was homely—that in appearance at least he was 
unfortunate? Not so. Looking at his picture your heart seems to go out 
toward. him. Well known artists say that his face had all the lines of beauty. 
It had all the lines of kindness also. 
Arthur. . 
What Lincoln gained he gained by struggle. Cold, hungry, in a wretched 
backwoods cabin, Lincoln cast these hardships aside. But though he cast 
them aside for the moment, the struggle made a mark upon him, and when 
he left behind the forest and the cabin, he took with him the power they 
gave him. 
We admire Lincoln for his courage, putting before the people, at the 
risk of political disaster, such a speech as, “A house divided against itself 
cannot stand; I believe this nation cannot endure permanently half slave 
and half free.” We admire his modesty: “The world will little note nor 
long remember what we say here” are words the world will never forget. 
We admire his perseverance, his honesty, his sincerity, his simplicity. What 
other man ever rose through every class, from the lowest to the highest, 
without a thought of his own glory? But above all, in this time of world 
war, we admire him for his fairness, his sense of justice. In his second 
inaugural address, he blamed both the North and South—the South for its 
persistence in holding slaves; the North for its delay in driving slaves out 
of the land. He seemed to be far above the ordinary routine of life. He 
looked down on both sides, and he judged fairly. “Both read the same Bible,” 
he said, “and pray to the same God.”

The play which follows, The Liberator, was written by the 
eighth grade of 1915, at the request of the Printing Department, 
to illustrate the power of the press. Its composition took a 
long time, and was possible only because of the background 
the class had gained in six weeks’ earnest work on Lincoln’s life 
and times. The eighth grade of 1918 chose to repeat it for the 
Lincoln Exercise.

of slavery. All day he sits in a dirty little hole that he calls the office of the 
Liberator, and sets up his worn-out old type. There aren’t two men in Bos- 
ton who wouldn’t pull a rope to stretch his neck. 
Bradley. It’s false! There aren’t two other men in the country who 
could persevere under the public ridicule Garrison gets. (Picks up Libera- 
tor.) All these twenty years Garrison himself has been a slave. He is the 
kind of man that ought to be appreciated and loved, but he is hated and 
shunned. Look at the motto of the Liberator, “Our Country is the World; 
Our Countrymen are Mankind.” 
Mr. Thomas. You are right. Garrison is striving for a goal so far 
beyond common men we can’t see its glory. He's above the mock of men; 
he sees before him a perfect land of freedom, and he strives toward it, 
though we all pull back. It is not for nothing that he works day after day 
to get out the Liberator. Every free man in America is suffering with the 
slaves, while human beings are being held by their brothers as if they were 
dogs. 
Hopkins. Dogs? Garrison is a hound. He is ruining this country for 
the sake of a few ignorant blacks. Is that justice? The slave may deserve 
freedom, but the welfare of our country comes first. He is doing this only 
to make money—money ! 
Thomas. Ruining our country, indeed! Mr. Garrison is ruining him- 
self. Though he has not a cent, he stands for the right. Though thousands 
are against him, he fights on. How long will civilized countries trade with 
a free country that sells men like dogs? It is the will of God that the slaves 
be free. Garrison is God’s messenger, 
Wilson. Who is this Garrison? 
James. Who is he? He’s the man who. is stirring up the country. ° 
He’s the man that is making the North hate the South and the South hate 
the North. He's the man that’s spoiling business and splitting parties. And 
why is he doing it? Because he thinks that our constitution is a covenant 
with hell. And so he runs this crazy paper and makes his living by trying 
to cheat southern gentlemen of their maintenance. Yes, who’s Garrison? 
He’s a rat, a dirty rat, and he chooses that way of making his living. 
Bradley. Look here. You can say all you like against Garrison’s cause, 
that’s your privilege, but you can’t attack his character. Garrison’s open 
and above-board; he’s working heart and soul for the blacks, and when the 
time comes he’ll free them.

McCarthy. So we have part of the underground railway corporation 
here? 
Bradley. Yes, sir, you have. If you keep us from doing the right above 
the ground, we'll do it underground. 
Hezekiah Jenkins (to Citizen). Are you for the niggers, too, sir? 
Wilson. Sir, I am for anything that helps our country to improve and 
progress, but I do not think that stirring up hatred within her boundaries will 
help to preserve her from the hatred that is ever without. Therefore, I 
say, let the slaves be slaves if it helps our country. In no time at all the 
slavery question has gone from bad to worse. We were a prosperous, 
peaceful country. We are now divided into two factions, each hating the 
other, each jealous of the other. 
Bradley, And do you think that it does help our country to have these 
poor wretches toiling in bondage, making the working whites despised and 
the gentlemen useless snobs? Do you think it is worthy of our country to 
pose as free and hold humani beings in cruel bondage? 
McCarihy. And if the nigger was free, what would he do but hinder 
the country, ruin the white laborer who will not work for low wages? And 
what kind of citizen will he make? 
Tim. Same kind you’ve taught him to make. 
Bradley, Righto! This thing has got to come sometime. 
Webster. But I say it doesn’t have to come. 
McCarthy. I'M dissolve the country if it does. 
Thomas. It will unite the country if it does. Our country at the 
present time is at a grave crisis, brother is turning against brother, family 
is turning against family, and the cause is simply this, that there are a few 
people, too many, who think that they are better than others who are of a 
different race. Is it possible that in this century a man is beaten like a 
hound? Is it possible to conceive the pain and agony of that cutting, biting 
rawhide whip? .The day will come, and come soon, when the question will 
be decided. -God help the right. 
Hezekiah Jenkins. How does Mr. Garrison dare print this paper when 
he has so many bitter enemies? 
Stickney. Why should he be afraid of any man living? This is a free 
country. We stand for free religion, free speech, a free press. 
Thomas, Ay, and free men. Nothing in this world or the next could 
dissuade Garrison from publishing this paper and preaching freedom. He is 
constant in purpose, though in ‘danger of his life. Believe me, Garrison’s 
name will ring down the ages, He and his paper cannot perish. 
Baker. Here, boy, a Courier. 
Anthony. I'd like to choke Garrison to death and dump his press into 
the river. Here, boy, I'll give you twice what you make if you will quit 
handing out that Liberator all the time.

Mrs. Penn, Ay, Tim, I'd gladly go, if it would help to make California

when half of our states have slaves? 
Tim, I don’t, ma’am. You haven’t told me what paper ’tis you’re want- 
ing. But, sure, I don’t need to ask. Here is the latest edition of the 
Liberator. Thank you, ma’am. Gold, gold in California. Extra paper!

Sherman. Don’t say Liberator to me again, 
Tim. Huh! It’s a paper that takes brains to run. 
Sherman. Oh, brains! The editor’s a very intelligent man. Making, 
heaps of money out of it, too. . 
Stickney. This paper makes me feel more every week that we are 
hampering our race, as well as the blacks, by slavery. 
Phillips. Yes, and the longer we keep them slaves, the less able they 
are to be free. 
Sherman. These radicals divide the country and make each side hate 
the other. Why, their howling has already lost a. thousand votes for our 
party. A nice paper to be sold in the streets of Boston! 
Tim. Sure, people come and buy a paper, and the first thing I know 
they come back and throw it in my face. Then I sell it again, 
Websier. The slaves are personal property, such as no man has a right 
to take away. Garrison is like a fire on a great prairie. He must be 
stopped without delay, or we shal! see the nation in a blaze. 
Phillips. Every word that that man writes is true. This is supposed to 
be a free country, but do you suppose we can make it so when almost one- 
third of our population is in bondage? 
Wilson. I believe in gradual emancipation. Set the young negroes free 
and educate them. But do you think it will help our country to free all these 
old ignorant blacks? 
Sherman. This paper has been going on for nearly twenty years. Must 
we tolerate this disgrace to Boston? I stand for the good of Boston—for the 
good of its citizens. I say this paper is a disgrace. 
Webster. The other day a man from St. Louis came to see me. He 
jeered, “How is your little comic paper, the Liberator? In St. Louis, when we 
mention Boston, we always get a laugh.” Shall this be said of our Boston?

ainthony. You wish me to speak to you? 
Crowd. Yes. Speech, speech! 
Anthony. Fellow citizens, I have nothing to say to you. There is nothing 
to be said on this subject. You feel that— 
Webster. ‘The slaves are property. 
Stickney. The slaves are human beings. 
Wilson, Our country comes first. ~ 
Anthony, And I feel the same. I say the thing speaks for itself. It is 
not only the question of slavery that confronts us, it is not only the question 
of the welfare of Boston, but it is the question of the safety of our country. 
Here is this man Garrison, stirring up hatred, striving to separate our people, 
to weaken our defenses against foreign nations. What is there to be said 
about this? 
Mob. Nothing! Do something! Stop him! 
Anthony. Those negroes will work for low wages, starvation wages. 
Laborer, Down with the niggers! 
Anthony, If the South is on hostile terms with us they will not trade 
with us. 
Merchant. Down with the niggers! 
Anthony. Tf they are estranged from us, they will send their cotton to 
England. 
Manufacturer, Down with the niggers! 
Anthony. And the North itself will be turbulent. We shall not have 
unity of feeling. 
Politician, Down with the niggers! 
Laborer, Down with the Liberator! It will ruin us. 
Anthony. Look at our country? Peaceful and progressing rapidly. 
What will happen when all those niggers are let loose? What will happen 
when we are divided in two, when our trade is divided, when our laborers 
and their families are starving? Men of Boston, you know Garrison; you 
know the Liberator. But I am thinking of the merchant; I am thinking of 
the laborer. If Garrison has his way, there will be war. I need not, I trust, 
remind you of our hard struggle for liberty and how our fathers framed the 
constitution. This man Garrison tore up the constitution because it did not 
abolish slavery. He is the man that is going to bring a great war on America. 
Every man that would have the country live, stop and think, Let the 
South refuse to trade with us, and what will that mean? It will mean bank- 
ruptcy, strikes, public disgrace. Garrison’s work will make trouble with the 
South. 
Crowd, Down with Garrison! 
Anthony. Fellow citizens, do you love your country? 
Crowd. Yes, yes! 
Anthony. You all shout “Yes,” but Garrison is against his country, our

country, 
Crowd. Let’s mob him. 
Anthony. It’s a disgrace to Boston. Every loyal citizen should think so. 
Garrison may mean well, but is Boston, is our country, to be ruined by well- 
meaning lunatics? Shall we put up with slander against President, constitu- 
tion, country, because there is a madman in the town? 
McCarthy. He is not mad. He’s as cool-headed as we are. 
Anthony. Not mad, do you say? Could any man in his senses wish 
to destroy his country, to weaken her so that European powers can seize 
her? The legislature of Georgia has offered a reward of $5,000 to any one 
who will kidnap Garrison and bring him to that state for trial. Citizens of 
Boston, shall we tolerate such a man in our city? It disgraces us and the 
whole North. Slavery is an old and established institution. Why should we 
disturb it? The editor of the Liberator is a coward and an enemy to men. 
Tf the slaves are freed, who will do the work—who can do the work? Will 
it be done? No, 
Wilson. That’s true. It sounds right. 
Bradley. Right? No, it’s wrong. It is all a lie. 
Anthony. Boys, there are a good many abolitionists in this town, but 
the worst is Garrison. He is stirring up the town to a dreadful riot. Oh, 
if I were but an orator I would rouse you to such a rage that you would— 
James. We will. Let’s mob him. Let’s put a halter round his neck and 
drag him through the streets and show him to the people and say, “Here 
is the savior of the slaves!” 
Anthony, Stay, boys, don’t be rash. This Liberator is a fairly good 
looking paper, and Mr, Garrison has to make a living. Suppose it does say 
that the slaves should be free, and should vote, and that the slaves are human 
beings and are equal to us. 
James. Let’s throw his press into the river. 
Hopkins, Yes, and see if any of these wonderful black pets of his will 
heave it out for him. 
Wilson. This means murder. Run, Tim, tell Garrison to escape. 
Tim. Escape! He’ll come right down among them, if he hears there’s 
danger. . 
Anthong (catching up a pack of “Liberators’}. This—this it is that is 
trying to lead the whites to destruction! 
Citizen (striking a match), I say, burn it. 
Second Citizen. Yes, burn the Deyil’s Bible. 
Other Citizen. Ay, mob him, tear him to pieces, destroy his press! 
Anthony, Friends, why be violent? When you are called to answer for 
your acts, do not say “Anthony has done this,” for I do solemnly advise you, 
urge you, pray you not to commit an act of violence. 
Citizen. ’Tis our duty. Burn the Liberator! 
Tim. Holy Mother, he has heard them. MHere’s Mr. Garrison now. 
(To Wilson). Run! Down Lane! (To mob). He’s escaping. (To Stick- 
ney and Bradley). You can save him. Lead the mob. Drag him to the 
city hall.

. Scene IL 
(PRINTING OFFICE—SEPTEMBER, 1862. GARRISON SETTING TYPE. BRADLEY AND 
Mrs, GarRISON IN OFFICE.) 
Garrison, War, war! Nothing else but this bloody, terrible war. Now 
a new battle is being fought, now more blood is being shed. And the worst 
of it is that all this might have been settled in a peaceful, civilized way 
instead of by a cruel and merciless war. The selfishness and hardness of 
men’s hearts is at the root of it all, making this war the bloodiest in alt 
history. Civilized men today are worse than savages. 
Stickney. But look at our great men. Think of Lincoln— 
Garrison, Lincoln is the worst of them all. He is well called the slave 
hound of Illinois. I am busy now setting up an editorial denouncing Lincoln 
for not proclaiming unconditional, immediate emancipation. I am aware that 
many object to the severity of my language, but is there not a cause for 
severity? I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice. I 
do not wish to think or speak or write with moderation. No! No! Tell 
a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm. Tell the mother 
to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen, but 
urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present. I am in earnest. 
‘I will not equivocate. I will not excuse. I will not retreat a single inch, and 
I will be heard. 
Stickney. You are wrong about Lincoln, Garrison. It has been your 
life work to free the slaves; but the burden of the nation at this terrible 
crisis has been upon his shoulders. He is the only man that God ever made 
who could steer the ship as he has steered it. 
Garrison. I cannot hope for much from that man. 
Stickney. Well, emancipation has to come sometime, and when it does 
we shall have you to thank. Fourteen years ago you were in peril of your
-P-A-G-E-82
Stupies In EpucaTIon 79 
life. Now you hold public opinion in the hollow of your hand. -You have 
slaved for the slave for thirty years, 
Garrison. And ii the slave is freed, I shall count that labor requited. 
How can any man who has the power to free the slave forbear? 
Stickney. Lincoln’s object is to save the Union. And it is beginning 
to look as if he were going to do it. 
(Enter mail carrier. Mrs, G. sorts mail.) 
Mrs. Garrison. Do you remember, Mr. Stickney, when his mail con- 
sisted mostly of threats against his life? Now it is full of complimentary 
and congratulatory letters, and we have new subscribers in every mail. 
Stickney. Yes, a great change has come over the people in the past 
thirty years. You used to be mobbed and hated. Now you are respected 
and loved. 
Garrison. I always believed that sooner or later people would begin to 
think more seriously about what I was saying. 
Mrs. Garrison. Where is the subscription book, William? 
Stickney. You'll have to buy some new type, I think. The issue is so 
large now, and so many people read it, that you ought not to use this worn- 
out old stuff. You deserve a lot of credit, Mr. Garrison, and your time is 
coming soon. This civil war is going to change something. It will end in 
victory for the North. It’s comin’ yet, for a’ that, and every slave will be free, 
Garrison. God grant it. When that happens my work is finished. 
(Enter Hezekiah Jenkins.) 
Hezekiah. May 1 shake hands with you, Mr. Garrison? I’ve been read- 
ing the Liberator fourteen years. I bought my first one that day the broad- 
cloth mob nearly ended you and your newspaper career. My last one, too, 
it would have been, had it not been for a sharp little Irish newsboy on the 
street. 
Garrison. Yes, Tim saved my life that day. Tim’s in the army now, 
adjutant-colonel. 
Hezekiah. Well, I’ve got a boy at the front. That’s what brings me to 
Boston today. He must be fighting at Antietam this very minute. When 
do the latest bulletins come in? 
(Enter telegraph messenger. Mrs. Garrison signs. Garrison turns back to 
work. She reads the message and hands it to Stickney. Cheering outside.) 
Anthony (outside). Now, boys, give him the nine. Ready, one, two, 
three, Garrison! 
(Enter Anthony.) 
Anthony. Congratulations, Mr. Garrison. 
Garrison. I don’t understand. 
Mrs. Garrison. William, it has come at last. Those cheers outside were 
for you. Hear Tim’s telegram. “Mr. Lincoln has signed the proclamation. 
The slaves are free. Tim.” And here, William, William, listen! here is a 
telegram from Mr. Lincoln himself. (Reads) “Thanks and deep appreciation 
to the upholder of American freedom. You have taught the country that 
slavery is wrong. You have helped to make us all free, a United States, 
where all men are free and equal. Abraham Lincoln.”

(Garrison, after one long breath, turns suddenly to the case and begins to 
work swiftly.) 
Garrison. Lincoln says this to me, and I thought him— 
Mrs. Garrison, What are you doing, William? 
Garrison. Destroying my words against Lincoln, Setting up the last 
issue of the Liberator. Dear friends, my life’s work is done. For over thirty 
years I have labored for the freeing of the slaves. Now they are free! Mr. 
Lincoln will carry on the war till he compels the South to give up their 
prey. Now [can die in peace. (Meanwhile other eager friends have crowded 
into the office, among them Thomas and Phillips.) 
Thomas. Your work done! It is hardly started. Your work will not 
be completed, nor will mine nor any other citizen’s until every foul pool of 
wickedness in this country is drained. 
Garrison. When the harvest is all reaped, do the laborers still stay in 
the field? 
Mrs. Garrison. William, you must not stop. What will you eat, where 
will you sleep? 
Garrison. What do these trifles matter? My work is done. The slaves 
‘are free. 
Phillips. My friend, why do you stop? Even if the blacks are free, there 
are others who suffer in bondage. The white laborer still toils in chains. 
Long hours, small wages, tedious work, all help to make link after link of 
hardship. Mr. Garrison, your help and influence are needed. Will the 
Liberator refuse its powerful aid to this cause? 
Garrison. That is your work, not mine. Your work is still ahead of 
you; mine is now behind. It has been said of me that my only purpose in 
running this paper was to make my living. Shall.I make it true? I began this 
work because the slave was a burden on my soul. His chain chafed my 
wrists. The lash which he felt drove me to darkest despair. And now, 
shall I work myself up over something else? No, I say my work is done. 
Anthony. But my dear Mr. Garrison. You have acquired so much 
influence. Why not enter politics in some worthy cause? Now, if you— 
Garrison. Ay, turn the force used “for helping the oppressed to assisting 
the oppressor. 
Anthony. My dear Mr. Garrison, you cannot be thinking of depriving 
the country of your paper, the fount of truth and freedom? 
Garrison. My dear Mr. Anthony, fourteen years ago my paper was the 
Devil’s Bible, the fount of all hatred and falsehood. 
Anthony. Sir, I admit that fourteen years ago I, like many others, was 
in the wrong. But a statesman must be open to conviction. Your eloquence, 
sir, convinced me. 
Garrison. And my prominence. 
Anthony. Your prominence, Mr. Garrison, is but the well deserved proof 
of your eloquence, You and your paper should enter politics, 
Garrison. Mr, Anthony, my paper has been devoted to a high and just 
cause. It shall never be the organ of hypocrisy and cupidity. Good day, sir. 
(Exit Anthony.)

Thomas. My dear friend, let me beg you not to discontinue the Liberator. 
From the cowardly, slaving negro you have made the brave freeman. Is 
there no more to be done? Must we lose your powerful influence? The 
earnest, thinking men of Boston look to the Liberator for guidance. The 
world cannot spare your noble paper. The Liberator and the Liberator’s 
maker-are immortal. 
Garrison. My friends, say no more, I am going to close shop forever. 
The slaves are free; their shackles broken, The work of the Liberator is 
done, The many weary days I have spent in this shop have not been spent in 
vain. The object I have so painfully sought is won, thanks to Mr. Lincoln, 
the purifier of this blood-stained country. I thought him incapable, and he 
congratulates me, thanks me, this President whom I thought a weakling. 
He has finished my task. Did I once have a picture of this man? (Finds one ;.

The poem which Benjamin, a member of the eighth grade, 
wrote, and which closes the Lincoln exercise of 1919, was Benjamin’s 
expression of the conviction of the whole class after their study of 
Lincoln: that Americans should study his character and carry on 
his teaching. It is this idea that they tried to convey throughout 
the exercise.

Elisabeth, 
He cleft the rail, as did many of his followers, but he thought of higher 
things, Still, little did this humble rail-splitter realize how even Europe 
would cherish his name; little did he think that his picture would be in many 
a Russian peasant’s hut—the picture of an American peasant who lived to 
reach the very mountain-top of fame, to guide America through a dreadful 
war, to set her slaves free. To us he is living still, and when any great. 
question comes to us, we turn to him. What would he do in the present 
crisis? 
Were Lincoln at the Peace Conference now, his would be the command- 
ing figure. 
An American poet gazed at the well known cast of Lincoln’s hand and 
wrote, 
“Look on this cast and know the hand 
That bore a nation in its hold: 
From this mute witness understand 
What Lincoln was—how large of mould.” 
Can you not see him put out his great hand, as if to protect the people’s
-P-A-G-E-85
82 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
rights, Lincoln, the world’s best friend? Perplexed and bewildered by 
baffling problems, we Americans instinctively turn to the great teacher of 
America, Abraham Lincoln, 
William, 
Is this great teacher, who guided America through the Civil War, helping 
to solve the problems that are arising in Europe? Yes, for his spirit’ thrills 
Americans to make the world safe for all people. It was his steady teaching 
that brought the full meaning of democracy to us. Amidst our perplexity . 
and bewilderment before the great questions now to be settled, we fix on the 
way in which this humbly great man treated his enemies. “Let us judge not 
that we be not judged,” he said. But it hardly seems possible that we cannot 
punish the guilty one, the one at ‘whose cruel commands a heel of iron crushed 
those in the way of his blood-thirsty hordes. Would Lincoln say, as he 
said in 1865, “I hope there will be no persecution, no bloody work after this 
war is over. No one need expect me to take part in hanging or killing those 
men.” What would Germany do in our place? One dreads to think of it. 
Yet perhaps more may be taught by mercy than by punishment. While the 
world is bitter with revenge, we look for Lincoln’s example. Though on the 
bloody battlefields of war he knew his men had fallen fast, though he 
sympathized with the people at home over the loss of the brave men who 
struggled for the Union, at the end he was bitter toward none. In his second 
inaugural address he says, “Neither party expected for the war the magnitude 
or the duration which it has already obtained. Each looked for an easier 
triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same 
Bible and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.” 
“With malice toward none, with charity for all; with firmness in the 
right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work 
we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have 
borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may 
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all 
nations,” 
Robert. . 
If Lincoln were at the peace table, can we imagine what his great mind 
would think or his tongue would speak? Would he want revenge on the 
German people? Would he not think of himself in their places? Would he 
not consider whether it was the fault of the people that this war came on? I 
dare say he would remark, in his quaint way, that it reminded him—and then 
would come one of Lincoin’s inimitable stories. Why had these simple stories 
so much power and force? Many a long discussion, many a heated argument, 
he forestalled by one of these homely tales. The opponent was won, his 
ill humor dissolved. 
Every one knows that after Booth’s cruel bullet had done its deed, all 
of Lincoln’s noble, kindly ideas were put aside, and hateful plans of revenge 
against the foe were laid. Military governors were placed at the head of 
the states and deprived the people of their just rights. A law was made that 
all those who had borne arms against the Union were barred from holding
-P-A-G-E-86
Srupies In EpucaTIon 83 
public office. Carpet-baggers took possession of the crippled South, and 
with their cunning persuaded the ignorant negroes to vote for them, The 
South was so paralyzed that the work of reconstruction was almost impos- 
sible. During this time the Ku-Klux Klan was organized. They made it 
their duty to punish and harass the negroes. Sometimes they hung and killed 
Innocent negroes. This could have been prevented if the military governors 
had filled their offices properly. A second great mistake was in allowing all 
the negroes to vote. This was far from being Lincoln’s plan. He wished to 
give the vote to all negroes of superior intelligence, and to those who had 
fought in the armies of the North. The rest he would have made apprentices, 
taught good trades, and given them the vote as their intelligence justified it. 
If Lincoln’s assassination could have been averted these mistakes and many 
others would have been prevented, If Lincoln had lived, the bitter, feeling in 
the South and the persecution of the rebels would have been avoided. So 
now, in this great reconstruction period, let us study the ideas of Lincoln and 
prevent, as far as possible, bitter feeling throughout the world. 
I see Lincoln at the Peace Conference, pleading for a worthy judgment. 
I hear him rebuke the man who urges revenge; I hear him say that there 
were many men responsible for the conflict, and that, “If we had tried to 
wipe out that black cloud long ago, there would never have been such an 
enduring war.” J hear him urge, everything to help civilization and nothing 
to hinder it. If Lincoln’s teachings have reached us, we shall think before 
we take revenge. “It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task 
remaining before us; that this world under God shall have a new birth of 
freedom.” 
Helen. 
The great task remaining before us is world peace—not an armed peace 
like the last, but real peace. We must not have another war. When we think 
of the horrors of the recently ended conflict, we foresee the power of 
destruction of a future war. The earth will not be a fit habitation for men. 
Much of the fighting will be done by inanimate things, striving to conquer 
and destroy other lifeless monsters. All the age-long struggle for con- 
struction will be cast aside by the pitiless arm of destruction. Gas will be 
invented that will not only kill all life, but destroy buildings as well. Deadly 
artillery will wipe men off the face of the earth, seconded by such improved 
airplane bombing that an army of men must needs be employed to stand 
day and night, telescope in hand, or ready with anti-aircraft device, to prevent 
a sudden attack on the coasts. Overwhelming taxes will have to be imposed 
to support the ‘armies. 
The farmer, the weaver, the builder, all the men upon whom we lean 
for food, clothing, shelter, will leave their plows, their looms, their mills, for 
the gun, the tank, the bomb. The great beast of war crawling from its den 
will breathe death on men in the field and children at home. 
If all this horror, bloodshed, and expense can be averted by a democratic 
league of nations, would Lincoln allow the Peace Conference to fail? Lincoln 
was not a man of war, though he “would accept war rather than let the 
nation perish.” But he believed that the people could rule.

“Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of 
the people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? 
“Our popular government has often been called an experiment. Two 
points in it our people have already settled—the successful establishing and 
the successful administering of it. One still remains—its successful main- 
tenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it. It is now 
for them to demonstrate to the world that ballots are the rightful and peace- 
ful successors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly and constitution- 
ally decided, there can be no successful appeal back to bullets. Such will 
be a great lesson of peace: teaching men that what they cannot take by an 
election, neither can they take it by a war; teaching all the folly of being 
the beginners of a war.” 
Josephine. 
So with the other great problems of the peace table. What is to be done 
about Russia? How are the claims of the Balkan States to be adjusted? 
How are the boundary disputes among the various new countries to be 
settled? What can the League of Nations do to protect uncivilized people? 
Every question requires a vast knowledge, but no knowledge will be of use 
without Lincoln’s scorn of trickery, his patience, his faith in humanity, his 
humility. If America can make these qualities her own, she can so powerfully 
support Mr. Wilson, that no wiliness, no dishonesty, no secret belief in the 
war and revenge, and militarism can withstand America’s demands. Because 
we believe America is trying to do this, we say: 
He can sleep now. His great free soul can rest. His hours of work 
are not in vain. Kings are no more, and war has ceased. Peace is laying 
hold on the souls of the people. The world of peasant-folk is released. The 
shining hope of Europe free has come. Kings no more quarrel and slaughter. 
The great idea has come to the whole world. The people understand that no 
one can be free unless all are free. But a short time ago, the toil and 
travail of Lincoln seemed in vain. But warriors have turned to the work 
of the peaceful plow. A new era has begun. May peace rest on this earth 
forever, 
Benjamin, 
Oh, mourning figure, can men say that yet you mourn; 
That yet your hours of grief and care endure; 
That yet your lessons are not taught? 
No, yet you live, 
For how could we forget the weight of all your teachings? 
Oh, foe of murder, sleep on in peace, 
You need not walk the nights away, 
We heed and carry on your teachings. 
Yea! even on your grassy hillside 
You are with us, as in times before.

ADAPTATION IN THE CONTENT OF HIGH SCHOOL 
SCIENCE 
The principle that the needs of society determine the work of 
the school includes as a corollary the necessity for constant 
adaptation in the processes of education, since the determining 
needs of society are undergoing a constant evolution. However, 
the tendency of teachers, of school administrators, and of the 
entire educational system, is to oppose change and to crystallize 
both the subject-matter of the curriculum and the methods of 
presenting it. 
As a result adaptation does not take place smoothly and 
continuously, but suddenly, with resulting strain and disturb- 
ance. The war, which revealed many failures in co-ordinating 
the work in school with life outside of it, precipitated a period 
of general reorganization in education. The lessons of the war 
have emphasized the duty of the school to provide a real training 
for the responsibilities of citizenship, resting upon broad under- 
standing and intelligent insight. As a result of this pressure, 
all subjects in the high school curriculum are seeking to justify 
their continued existence through the contributions which each 
makes toward training the socially efficient being, the good 
citizen. 
It is not the purpose of this paper to present in a merely 
academic way the value of science study in training the future 
citizen of the world for the intelligent discharge of his duties.* 
- Rather, it is the purpose to describe some ways and means which 
have been used in the class room, laboratory and general life of 
the school to render science study a vital factor in the lives of 
the pupils and to secure a larger measure of flexibility in the 
science courses and a better adaptation to individual interests 
and needs, 
UTILIZING THE MORNING EXERCISE OR SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 
Good citizens are active in placing valuable information at the 
disposal of their fellows. So in school the science classes can do a

great deal towards actively sharing ideas and interesting facts with 
the rest of the school body. This finds a ready response in the gen- 
eral interest shown in scientific phenomena, and the eagerness to 
understand the demonstrations and explanations. In this school 
the daily morning exercise* furnishes the best opportunity for 
efforts of such a nature. Recently the chemistry class gave a series 
of four exercises. These exercises served to arouse interest in 
science in general and chemistry in particular; to stimulate pupils 
‘to thinking and perhaps experimenting at home and in leisure time; 
to illustrate the content of the chemistry course and to some extent 
to encourage pupils to elect science courses another year; to furnish 
the school with information on important topics. 
The titles and outlines of these exercises are given in some 
detail. 
I. WATER** 
Introduction—Importance of pure water to civic health and industrial 
prosperity. 
Testing and Purifying Methods Illustrated Experimentally—Suspended 
matter by sedimentation and filtration. Mineral salts by distillation, 
with tests for sulphates, chlorides, etc. Organic matter, including 
bacteria, by boiling and oxidation with potassium permanganate. 
Purification by Coagulation——-Methods used at Columbus, Ohio, illus- 
trated with roily water colored with cochineal. 
Relation of Water Supply and Sewage Disposal-—Chicago Drainage 
Canal an open sewer. Better methods of sewage disposal in use in 
other cities. 
Il. CHEMICAL MAGIC 
This exercise consisted of a series of spectacular experiments per- 
formed in such a way as to mystify the audience and challenge their 
ability to find a satisfactory explanation. It was gotten up by a small 
group of the class, more as a chemical vaudeville entertainment than a 
regular exercise in chemistry. 
A variety of indicators and reagents were used to ‘turn water into 
wine and back again, convert a large jar of apparent ink into clear water, 
a portion of which was drunk, and to produce other striking. color 
changes. Sympathetic ink was devised and used to predict magically 
the outcome of an election to be held on the morrow. For this purpose 
the writing had been done upon large sheets of paper with a solution of

potassium sulphocyanate. The messages were caused to appear by spray- 
ing the paper with a dilute solution of a ferric salt from a fine atomizer. 
Explosive soap bubbles were formed by blowing the air through a 
concealed bottle containing:a little gasoline. With the use of a spot light 
on a darkened stage a striking effect was produced. 
An unlighted cigarette was apparently smoked, whereupon the smoke 
was caused to appear in a large bell jar upon the table. Ammonia and 
acid fumes, used with a little sleight of hand, accomplished this. 
Large round filter papers had been previously treated with a solution 
of potassium nitrate. These were suspended in proper order and each’ 
one was set off with the red hot tip of a file. The letters burned out, 
spelling the word “Chemistry.” 
Water, poured into an apparently empty pan, was set on fire. This 
effect was produced by igniting a concealed cloth saturated with alcohol, 
by means: of a small bit of potassium. 
The final trick involved the calling down of “fire from heaven.” 
Red and green fire were ignited by electric spark from a concealed spark 
coil and at the same time the national emblem dropped across the rear 
of the stage. 
Ill, EXPLOSIVES 
Introduction—Explosion defined as rapid burning and an explosive as 
an intimate mixture or combination of oxygen and a fuel. 
Gunpowder.—Composition and burning explained. Gun-cotton} com- 
position and burning explained. Comparison of volumes of gases 
by equal amounts of gunpowder and dynamite illustrated by the use 
of charts. Meaning of high explosives made clear. 
Explosives in Warfare—T.N.T. as a type of modern high explosive, used 
in shells. 
Motion Picture—Farming with Dynamite (reel loaned by Du Pont de 
Nemours Company) showing interesting uses of dynamite on the 
farm. 
Iv. NITROGEN 
Composition of the Air—Rough analysis performed as an experiment. 
Calculation of weight of nitrogen in air resting on the roof of the 
Auditorium immediately over the heads of the audience. 
Nitrogen —Its inertness illustrated by experiment. An essential life- 
giving element. The nitrogen cycle explained by colored blackboard 
diagrams. 
Problem of Nitrogen Fixation—Relation to explosives in warfare. Gov- 
ernment plants in the United States and their significance for the 
future welfare of the country. 
These outlines show how civic and national problems may be 
drawn upon to furnish interesting work for a class, and how the 
ideas of the whole school may be clarified by a suitable morning 
exercise growing out of such studies.

THE STUDY OF CURRENT SCIENTIFIC EVENTS 
During the war the rapid development of all sorts of scientific 
devices furnished an especially strong motive for the study of cur- 
rent events in the field of applied science. Every member of the 
science classes was eager to learn all he could about submarines, 
airplanes, machine guns, gas warfare and so forth, and this interest 
was by no means confined to the science classes. To take advantage 
of this desire and of similar interests along other lines, the whole 
“high school was organized into groups, according to their major 
interests, science, military strategy, war literature, relief work, 
political developments.* 
The science section was so large that further sub-division accord- 
ing to interests was possible. Groups were formed to study aero- 
nautics, gas warfare, submarine construction and warfare, artillery 
developments, and methods of camouflage. The section met weekly 
at a regular period to hear reports from these groups, or to listen 
to outside speakers, of whom we were fortunate to hear a number 
on, interesting topics. _These included talks on ‘The Emergency 
Fleet Corporation,” by a member of that organization ; “The Train- 
ing of an Aviator,” by an instructor in that branch of the service; 
“Lighting and Signaling Devices,” by a patent lawyer, and “War 
Experiences,” by a number of returning graduates and friends of 
the school. The time was never permitted to drag, and usually more 
reports were ready than could be presented. Questions were 
numerous and interesting, though often information that would 
make the answers adequate was lacking. The responsibility for the 
meetings was readily assumed by the pupils in a way which showed 
their deep interest. The reports by pupils included the following: 
History of Aviation ; Flying Stunts; Types of Military Planes; Mus- 
tard Gas; The Gas Mask; Development of the Machine Gun; 
Thermit, with demonstration experiments, and many others. 
The intense interest in the military aspects of science evaporated 
with the coming of peace, but the same plan is now being continued 
for the study of current scientific developments and of the indus- 
trial aspects of science. This supplements more closely the work of 
the physics and chemistry classes, and so provides for a closer 
articulation of the science of the classroom and laboratory with that 
of industry and commerce.

TOPICS AND PROBLEMS INCLUDED IN THE REGULAR WORK OF THE 
PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY CLASSES MAKING FOR FLEXIBILITY 
The following list is added to show a great variety of interest- 
ing topics which may be drawn upon for illustrative and informa- 
tional purposes, special assignments, and individual reports. Local 
conditions, individual interests and needs, and the amount of time 
available must determine the selection of these topics, their emphasis 
and their proper organization into the larger units of study. Such 
a list could be greatly extended ; nevertheless, many topics suggested 
must through necessity be omitted, or only occasionally included.

Wireless Telegraphy* and the Wireless Telephone 
The Development of Electric Lighting 
Such topics as these are not new in courses in physics and 
chemistry, but the emphasis on them and the number of them should 
be greatly increased if science study is to have that quality of 
reality essential to educative activity. Courses of study in science 
have a marked tendency to crystallize into a static state. This is 
perhaps. due to the nature of science material, which lends itself to 
easy classification and organization, There is ever the danger that 
the teacher, content with teaching the system, the classification, may 
miss the vital connections by which the facts of science become 
significant and full of meaning to the pupil. 
Successful science teaching in the changing world of today 
requires a flexible course of study, the use of a wide range of 
projects, problems, and applications, making possible a closer adapta- 
tion to local conditions and individual interests and needs. Teachers 
of science have failed to keep the content of their courses up to 
date; they have lost contact with the latest discoveries and applica- 
tions in which the pupils are often most interested. These faults 
must be corrected if science study is to accomplish its great purpose 
and become as vital in the life of the school as it is in the life 
outside. 
*Just prior to the war a number of high school boys organized and equipped 
a very successful Wireless Club. A small building on the school grounds ‘was assigned to their use. This was thoroughly overhanled by the boys and an excellent set of instruments had just been installed when the government closed all amateur 
stations. The apparatus was donated to the school upon the graduation of most of 
the club members a year ago. A new club has now been formed by the boys of 
the physics class to carry on the study of this project. It is open, under certain 
conditions, to other high school boys.

. NEW MATERIAL IN MODERN LANGUAGE WORK 
Note: This article was completed by Mr. Merrill only a short time 
before his sudden death, November 1, 1919. It is indeed tragic that his life 
was cut short at a time when the influence of his ideals was spreading 
rapidly, through the publications described in the article. It is to be hoped 
that some way will open for the continuance of a work so valuable to modern 
language teaching throughout the country. The following excerpt from the 
memorial statement, in the third number of Le Monde Francais, will show 
how generously he gave himself to the fulfillment of his ideals. 
“Mr. Merrill gave all of his time, outside of his teaching, to these publica- 
tions, and they reflect the painstaking devotion he gave to them. He spared 
neither time nor expense in making them as perfect and as progressive 
educationally as possible. His summers were spent in travel and study on 
the continent, and lately in Cuba and Porto Rico, gathering material for the 
new issues. Nothing is more indicative of the thoroughness which character- 
ized Mr. Merrill’s work than the large force of collaborators he called in to 
help in editing and criticizing the material selected for publication. Surely 
the ideas for which he strove survive, and his work for the improvement of 
the teaching of modern languages will keep his memory alive through many 
years to come.” 
In order to make the modern language work responsive to the 
special needs of the pupils, we hold to the ideal of selecting topics 
as far as possible associated with subjects of special interest to the 
child. Since the teachers are free, so long as they observe the col- 
lege entrance requirements, to use any methods or present any 
topics for discussion which are believed to be worth while, many 
points of contact have been found between the modern language 
work and the work of other departments. We believe in examining 
closely the work and play of a grade in order to discover profitable 
connections between it and the teaching of a modern language. 
While many opportunities have escaped us, and while not all the 
teachers have been able to plan their work along this special line, 
nevertheless, as we look back over the years of the school’s existence, 
many examples occur to us showing the relation of a modern 
language to a grade activity. 
At the very beginning of the course, in the work of all primary 
grades, the point of contact is play rather than work. Therefore, 
games in which a foreign language is spoken or sung are intro-

are typical of games played by the youngest children. he children 
delight in the opportunity to express themselves in a foreign lan- 
guage when this expression is a part of some interesting activity. 
With geography many obvious points of contact exist, and a 
vast amount of intensive work has been accomplished at different 
times during the school’s history. In the grammar grades much 
supplementary work has been done on such subjects as Brittany, 
Normandy, the Tell country, and the Black Forest. The high school 
Spanish classes have studied life in Cuba, Porto Rico, Spain, and 
other countries where the language is spoken. Of course maps 
and charts are constantly in use in all high school work. In addi- 
tion, special leaflets have been prepared by some of the teachers and 
used from year to year in the classes. 
The study of certain periods of history has also been enriched 
by the modern language work. Seventh grade classes studying the 
time of chivalry enjoyed in their language work stories of the typical 
mediaeval heroes, Roland, Charlemagne, Siegfried. Pictures, per- 
sonal souvenirs of travel, and wall charts, showing life in the olden 
times in peace and war, illustrated these discussions. 
With music, the associations are many and delightful. Folk- 
songs and songs for special occasions, particularly Christmas, are 
always great favorites. For years no Christmas celebration was 
complete without the singing of beautiful old songs of the countries 
whose languages were studied. The war modified this tradition to 
some extent. 
Senior classes have found it decidedly worth while to devote 
some time in their modern language work to scientific reading. Boys 
keenly interested in’ chemistry are especially eager for this work 
and often acquire considerable proficiency in reading German texts 
on the subject. 
For years it has been customary for the students in certain 
modern language classes to devote a good deal of attention to rapid 
reading without translation, in order to gain a feeling of power in 
the use of the language, but particularly in order to increase their 
appreciation of literature. In some groups each student pursues a 
different course of reading but makes frequent reports to the class 
on the work done or the problems encountered. Each pupil is 
encouraged to read books which he can understand, on subjects 
which to him are of special interest. Gradually and very encourag-
-P-A-G-E-98
Stupies In Epucation 95 
ingly the power of reading without translation is developed. Pupils 
accomplish a good deal of this reading during the long summer 
vacation, a few even finding pleasure in additional study of the 
classics. 
In the three modern languages taught at the school, a vigorous. 
international correspondence has brought about a more vivid appre- 
ciation of life in the great foreign world. The first exchange of 
letters was arranged some ten or twelve years ago between pupils. 
in our high school and young people in German schools. For the 
past year or so a fairly brisk correspondence has been going on be- 
tween our pupils and French, Cuban, Porto Rican or Spanish boys. 
and girls. Similar letters are planned to include German Switzer- 
land. 
The arrangements for the Spanish correspondence with Cuba 
were made through personal friends of the writer. At the start all 
pupils, even in high school classes, have written in the mother tongue 
on topics presumed to be of special interest to the correspondent in 
question. Pictures, postcards, and newspaper clippings were en- 
closed. The next step in the correspondence will be the writing of 
letters in Spanish, with the hope of receiving the native correspond- 
ents’ criticism of.idiom and construction. . 
Through the Department of Public Instruction in Porto Rico, 
several correspondents in San Juan high schools were secured. A 
teacher in this city suggested to the Porto Rican boys that they 
should write as to an intimate friend—using the intimate form of 
address—and should tell their new friends of interesting happenings. 
on the island and customs of native life. A typical letter, written 
by a Porto Rican boy to his friend at the Parker School, follows: 
Mi queridisimo amigo: 
Recibi la tuya, la cual me causé gran alegria, pues ya yo creia que mi 
carta se habia perdido. 
Me alegraria mucho, si pudieras dar un viaje a Puerto Rico, para que

es para que los caballos se alimenten antes de regresar al cielo.

regresado, los cuales hemos recibido con gran entusiasmo. Todavia falta por 
Hegar la banda del Regimiento.

Jorge Martinez. 
In order to secure sttitable addresses from Spain, Argentine, and 
Mexico, letters were written to American consular officials. Cour- 
teous replies were received, giving the names of teachers or schools 
interested in the subject of international correspondence. One of 
the young men from that city sent views of Barcelona, so that his 
new friend “might admire a little this beautiful city.” 
The greater part of the recent correspondence in French had its 
origin in societies for the relief of the fatherless children of France 
and in other welfare organizations. When the school decided to 
adopt a number of French war orphans, letters were interchanged 
in order that our pupils might learn more definitely of the needs and 
desires of the children they wished to help. Through the courtesy 
of Mrs. Walter Brewster, 741 Fine Arts Building, Chicago, the 
school was given a list of children needing assistance. Soon a very 
interesting correspondence developed between the French and 
American children . The following is a letter received by one of our 
pupils: 
Fécamp, le 8 Décembre 1918. 
L’armistice est la. Tout fe monde est joyeux. On ne peut pas circuler 
sur les routes. Tout le monde est en féte, mais notre pauvre mére est 
restée chez nous a pleurer sachant que nous n’avons plus notre pére. Toutes 
les maisons sont pavoisées, toutes les églises sonnent, les vapeurs sifflent ‘et 
partout on tire le canon. Chacun se précipite avec des drapeaux a 1a main 
et crie: “Vive la France!” 
La vie est trés chére, mais dans notre ville il y a toujours du travail.

Even children of ten judge with decision when their minds 
are clear on the facts. It is necessary, therefore, to dwell long 
enough on the type studied in order really to appreciate it con- 
cretely. This may take weeks or even months, working with one 
great character. Generalizations get us nowhere. Most text 
books, however, contain only conclusions or general statements 
that represent the adult product of thinking. The children, on 
the other hand, need the concrete life-experiences to compare and 
pass judgment upon, in order to think. It takes longer than to 
memorize the statements that others make about the hero; but 
that which is to count in building character must reach the 
emotions and stir the will to action. 
Since most of us must be followers, we should recognize the 
necessary virtues of the common man, who is not.a leader at all. 
The qualities that the followers should have, some children 
stated thus: : 
A person who is to be led must be obedient, brave, and steadfast. M. 
A leader’s men should not be fighting among themselves. B. 
A captain has to have initiative. The sailors have to be faithful, and 
they must want the voyage to be a success. E. 
If a leader wants to have success he has to be honest and brave, and 
his men should be of the same character. L. 
The qualities that good followers should have are braveness, faithfulness, 
and obdientness. : A. 
Would the practical application of such ideas as these chil- 
dren express purify our sordid politics and make for good citizen- 
ship? Of course it is a long way from the expression of an idea 
to its carrying out. The worst feature of our community life is 
that we do not live up to the light that we have. On the other 
hand, if we start the children to thinking genuinely and judging 
frankly, we may sometime arrive at the actual realization of 
ideals.

THE LIFE OF LINCOLN 
There follow stenographic reports of the four exercises given 
in honor of Lincoln’s birthday in the last four years. The com- 
position and presentation represent the outcome of six weeks’ 
work on the life of Lincoln, from January 1 to February 12 each 
year. I believe that any teacher, reading these exercises, can 
see that the children wrote with genuine feeling from a relatively 
large fund of information, such as can be gained by concentra- 
tion upon one subject in all its phases for a considerable period. 
Their study was partly actuated by the knowledge that the 
school looked to them for the observance of Lincoln’s birthday, 
one of the three important patriotic exercises of the year. Six 
weeks is of course a very short time for so grave an undertaking 
but it is long enough—when history, literature, reading, com- 
position, drawing, are all directed toward the one end—for every 
pupil to build up a picture of what American democracy meant 
on the western frontier, and a fair conception of how the evil 
of slavery grew until civil war seemed the only solution. It is 
long enough to enable the pupils, at the end, when they come to 
plan their exercise, to write genuinely from loving admiration 
of Lincoln, based on some. knowledge, to write with relative 
power because their feeling is strong, and to write simply because 
they: have studied and admired simplicity. It is long enough 
for the spontaneous growth of moral judgments from the con- 
templation of moral genius such as Lincoln’s, lighted as it is by 
modesty and humor. The pupils compare him irresistibly with 
his cabinet, his generals, his fellow frontiersmen, his father, with 
Douglas, with Everett, with the leaders of our own great time. 
The flexibility of curriculum, discussed elsewhere in this 
volume, permits the teacher to take from environment and cur- 
rent events the material in which her pupils have a special inter- 
est, an interest which gives them a leverage for intensive work. 
It permits her also, as I intimated above, to use every period of 
every day, if necessary, to intensify the meaning of the subject, 
through literature, oral expression, written composition, drawing, 
history, geography—in short, through every form of expression 
and every avenue of impression. Correlative to this flexible 
66
-P-A-G-E-102
STUDIES IN EDUCATION 67 
curriculum in aiding a teacher to do her best for her pupils is 
freedom trom departmental work. Another great advantage is 
a flexible daily program. If Robert’s first remark when school 
opens is, “It’s only a little more than a week to Lincoln’s birth- 
day, and we haven’t even talked. about what our exercise shall 
be,” the teacher can say, “Very well, what’s your idea?” And 
if he has been very much impressed by the study of Pilgrim’s 
Progress and thinks we ought to write an allegory, we can all 
make suggestions for allegories, as the class did in 1916, choose 
one of them, and go to work upon it. The subject in which the 
interest is keenest, the thing for which the need is greatest, the 
material which has a right to the freshest attention, determines 
what shall begin the day. The teacher with the three advan- 
tages, a flexible curriculum, a flexible program, and a single 
group of pupils whose entire work she teaches, or supervises, is 
much to blame if she cannot aid her pupils in their moral develop- 
ment. I have spoken of giving them a basis for moral judgments. 
She should also be able to arouse and increase that courage for 
hard work, for drudgery, if you will, that is essential to useful- 
ness in society. This is achieved more easily when the social 
motive for work is strong—as it is in planning an exercise for 
the school on Lincoln,—and when the subject .is stimulating to 
the warmest hero worship and the finest love for humanity. 
Under such a stimulus, lazy, self-indulgent Jack will work two 
or three hours, after reading Vachel Lindsay’s “Abraham Lin- 
coln Walks at Midnight,” trying to write a poem of his own 
which will say that Lincoln may sleep, for America will carry 
on his work. The teacher should be able to awaken pride in 
good work without any false stimuli; habits of regular work; 
habits of intensive study and scorn of dawdling. The morning 
exercises which follow are evidence, perhaps, of hard work, will- 
ing work, and some power of moral judgment. 
1. 
The eighth grade of 1916 chose to write an allegory, because 
Pilgrim’s Progress had especially interested them. They each 
made one or more suggestions, of which a few follow. Of these 
we chose one, and the class worked it out together.

The North and South as a chain; this chain broken by slavery; the 
chainsmith, Lincoln, welding the chain together; the things that hindered 
him, such as a poor fire, bad tools, etc. Ww. 
We might call it a ship, tossed on the seas, and have barnacles represent 
the slaves, who are gluing themselves to the ship and gradually sinking it, 
and have Lincoln be the captain, who is arranging everything. Or, have a 
boy who is heir to the throne be in some way deprived of it and later, through 
his intellect, win the hearts of the people and regain the throne. Or, we 
might have Lincoln represented by a stag, which is chased by the hounds, and 
who waits until the right time and then gores the hounds and at last becomes 
the monarch of the forest. J. 
A man, Lincoln, should be working on a bridge, and every little while 
he would encounter some difficulty. Finally, as he finished it, he would 
slip and fall, killing himself but leaving the bridge almost complete. J. 
Columbia is striving to keep from catching the sickness, slavery. A 
group of doctors, representing the Ordinance of 1787, Missouri Compromise, 
ete., come in. But finally the doctors fail, and they find that her left arm, 
the South, will have to be cut off. Then comes Lincoln and saves Columbia. 
H. 
We might picture Lincoln as a gardener, watering and taking care of 
a beautiful flower, the flower of liberty, and picture these different ordi- 
nances and compromises as weeds or snakes or other things which try to 
kill the flower. L 
‘We might have Lincoln a scale-maker. One side would weigh more than 
the other, one side Liberty, the other War. M. 
We could have a young man, representing America, struggling to gain 
a certain point and going through many experiences. At last he sees a 
shining light, representing Lincoln, who guided the young man and gave 
him power and strength to carry on his work and find the right way. This 
would show what Lincoln had done to help his country. P. 
LINCOLN—AN ALLEGORY 
A certain man had a great estate. And always he kept a steward over 
the estate to tend the gardens, to care for the harvests, to plant orchards and 
shade trees, to welcome all who came. 
And there came a day when he must choose a new steward. And he 
bethought himself of all the learned men and they came unto him. Many 
mighty men came, and he was sorely troubled, not knowing whom to choose. 
And there came also, out of the wilderness, a simple man in rough gar- 
ments, who had great endurance, who was patient as he was simple, loving 
as he was strong, hopeful as he was humble. So the master, though doubtful, 
decided to make trial of the tall, hard-muscled, melancholy man, and send 
the others away. “It does not give me so much pleasure as I expected,” 
said the new steward, “but do not send the others away. Though they love 
me not, they shall be my helpers.”
-P-A-G-E-104
STUDIES IN EDUCATION 69 
Thereafter, whosoever traveled to this great estate saw standing within 
the gate a man of tall stature, gaunt, strong, with great hands which bore 
the mark of toil. Those that passed were wont to laugh and throw him 
taunts, but he heeded them not. He felt no pride in his high position, but 
with malice toward none strove to do well the great task before him. 
Upon a day came a curious visitor, inquiring about a great tree upon 
which the steward was earnestly gazing. “Why,” said he, “do you fx your 
gaze upon that one tree? The estate is great. There are fair flowers and 
pleasant lawns and many stately trees. Why is this one tree your chief care? 
And why is your gaze sad and anxious when you look upon it?” 
The steward turned his care-lined face to the questioner. Then his eyes 
lit with a quaint humor. He struck the tree a loving blow with his great 
hand, “Old tree,” he said, “why do I love thee?” Then turning to the 
questioner, he said, “My friend, fourscore and seven yéars ago our fathers 
planted that tree, that we, the people of this garden, might secure the 
blessings of liberty. It has withstood storms and the mighty power of the 
wind; when yet a tender shoot a great fire scorched it; here worms have 
eaten it; there lightning has struck it. It bears scars, bad scars, and deep 
seams, Yonder limb weights. it dreadfully. But my honor defends its life. 
If that tree of liberty die, all else on the master’s estate will be worthless. 
Without the assistance of the Divine Being it cannot survive; with that 
assistance it cannot die.” 
Often the master walked about, proudly inspecting his broad acres. And 
often the steward spoke with him anxiously concerning the tree. “This limb 
will he a great menace to its life in time of storm. A tree so divided cannot 
stand.” 
But the master said, “Stay, touch it not. Would that it had been 
pruned off while it was yet small. But now the branch is almost as large 
as the tree itself. If it were lopped off, I fear decay and death.” 
So the steward answered patiently, “Often a limb is amputated to save 
a life. But a life is never given wisely to save a limb. If that branch is 
not dangerous, nothing is dangerous. A bolt from the sky would split the 
tree from top to bottom. Even now in the west the sky is darkening, the 
clouds are low, and a-storm must come.” 
And the storm came. The windows of heaven were opened, and the 
rain poured forth, and the terrible lightning and thunder were released. 
The owner became sorely frightened, and rushed to the steward, and was 
very wroth with him, and gave harsh orders, and upbraided him. But while 
the owner in terror raged, the steward’s face was calm, though sad. With 
steady eyes he stepped firmly to the aid of his friend the tree. 
In the fury and wildness of the tempest, the tree shook wildly. The 
owner kept shouting, but the steward heard him not. He knew the danger 
and stood face to face with the storm. A flash of lightning illumined the 
strong determined face, and the great man stood in the wild wind. By the 
blinding glare he saw more clearly that the limb must fall. “It is dangerous,” 
he said, “but we must get at that branch; we must strike it off, or the whole 
tree will go.” Amidst the fearful hurricane he pulled himself laboriously
-P-A-G-E-105
70 Francis W. Parker ScHoor 
up the tree, he struck mightily at the dangerous limb. Now that he had a 
chance to hit it, he hit-it hard. Under the skilful strokes of his powerful 
ax, the branch fell. 
And though the gray form of treachery crept up behind, and brought 
death to the fearless steward, yet will the. master ever hold him The First 
American. 
Il. 
The eighth grade of 1917 had had a good deal of discussion 
on the question whether an American should pity Lincoln. They 
had each made a short oration to the class on some aspect of this _ 
matter. When they came to plan their exercise for the school, 
they recalled the best of these orations and combined them. 
Then they agreed to write an introductory paragraph based on 
Stanton’s words at Lincoln’s death bed, “Now he belongs to the 
ages.” Every one did his best on this paragraph, and we col- 
laborated. We followed the same plan for the concluding para- 
graph; the result was that, while only four people spoke, all the 
class had aided in the composition and considered the exercise 
a piece of class work. The same is true of the other exercises.

All the long night after Booth’s hateful bullet had crashed into Lin- 
coln’s brain, men stood about the bed, grief-stricken and amazed. As the 
last feeble pulse-beat ceased and the great soul started on its journey, Stanton 
whispered, “Now he belongs to the ages.” 
Not to the West, whence he came, belongs this rail-splitter ; it is not for 
the North to claim him, though he guided them through four years of 
dreadful war—no, not even the Union, which he loved more than life itself, 
can say, “He is ours,” for Lincoln belongs to the whole world, a gentle, sim- 
ple, great, kindly man of the people. Travelers tell of seeing his picture in 
the huts of Russian peasants. There must be some reason why this man, 
more than any other American, belongs to the ages,—why he is claimed by 
the simple people of the whole world. 
Frances. 
The Gettysburg Speech perhaps helps us to the reason. We love it and 
learn it, not because of its beauty, its compact unity, not even because of 
the wonderful skill which put into a three minute speech the meaning of the 
whole great struggle; not for these reasons chiefly, but because these words 
could have come from one man only. 
What gave him this power? We are wont to speak pityingly of Lin- 
coln’s childhood and early surroundings. But in that quiet forest while with 
mighty swing and sure stroke he cleft the rail, or with hoe and scythe aided
-P-A-G-E-106
Stuptes 1n- EpucaTIon 71 
his father to gain bread in the wilderness, there was time for great thoughts 
to grow and ripen. Can we doubt that forest and field helped to fit him for 
the great task lying before him? Can we doubt that this hard labor gave 
him respect for labor, made him unwilling that the toil of any man, 
black or white, should be unrequited? No one was so earnest in his resolve 
“that a government of the people, by the people, for the people, should not 
perish from the earth.” Can we pity him for surroundings that gave him 
such sympathy with the common man? “I am not ashamed to confess that- 
25 years ago I was a hired laborer, mauling rails, at work on a flat boat— 
just what might happen to any poor man’s son. I want every man to have 
a chance to better his condition.” Lincoln believed that afl men are created 
equal; that the poor, uneducated, hard-toiling slave had a right to a chance 
to better his condition. He himself had labored hard and his sympathy went 
out to labor, and he felt as not many others did that the slave should be free. 
He trusted the people with whom he had lived and labored. “None,” he 
says, “are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty 
—none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not earned.” 
He believed that the people.can rule and must rule. He says, “Why should 
there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the peoples? Is 
there any better or equal hope in the world?” The Gettysburg Speech shows 
“us that because of this noble democracy, this belief in the people, Lincoln 
belongs to the ages!

Lincoln’s childhood, was that unfortunate? Surely the trip across the 
broad Ohio and into the Indian wilderness was a joy. The outdoor life 
was not a misfortune. And we cannot forget that the move from Kentucky 
to Indiana was a move from a slave state to the northwest territory where 
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude could ever exist; where the free 
man could overcome poverty by honest labor. When Lincoln quotes “All 
men are created equal,” what does it mean? It means that where he grew 
into manhood all men were equal. No master said his servants were of a 
lower race than himself. That sturdy childhood taught the boy that all men 
are created equal. Was a childhood that could teach such a great lesson 
wholly unfortunate? ‘ 
Looking at many another boy we might say, “How unfortunate! Books 
so easy to get and so many! Schools and teachers so numerous! Money so 
plentiful! Excitement so constant! Everything so easy to get except ambi- 
tion! Who is most fortunate?” 
We have said that we can scarcely think Lincoln unfortunate in his 
surroundings. His surroundings were there not to hinder but to help him. 
Behind each blow of his axe was the great determination to make good. 
And it was this determination to make good that at length kept the Union 
together and set the slaves free. 
Shall we say that his education was unfortunate when his hard struggle 
taught him to be self-reliant? What is education? Lincoln grew up among
-P-A-G-E-107
72 Francis W. Parker SCHOOL 
people who were poor, uneducated, and unwilling to learn. But he was 
different. Everything educated him. Close contact with his rough neighbors 
taught him to understand human nature. Can the boy who for twenty miles 
around his home had trudged in search of books remain uneducated? Lin- 
coln was poor in material things but rich in ambition. Ambition taught him 
never to be content with what he had learned, but always to strive to learn 
more. That is education. 
Shall we say that he was homely—that in appearance at least he was 
unfortunate? Not so. Looking at his picture your heart seems to go out 
toward him. Well known artists say that his face had all the lines of beauty. 
It had all the lines of kindness also. 
Arthur. 
What Lincoln gained he gained by struggle. Cold, hungry, in a wretched 
backwoods cabin, Lincoln cast these hardships aside. But though he cast 
them aside for the moment, the struggle made a mark upon him, and when 
he left behind the forest and the cabin, he took with him the power they 
gave him. 
We admire Lincoln for his courage, putting before the people, at the 
risk of political disaster, such a speech as, “A house divided against itself 
cannot stand; I believe this nation cannot endure permanently half slave 
and half free.” We admire his modesty: “The world will little note nor 
long remember what we say here” are words the world will never forget. 
We admire his perseverance, his honesty, his sincerity, his simplicity. What 
other man ever rose through every class, from the lowest to the highest, 
without a thought of his own glory? But above all, in this time of world 
war, we admire him for his fairness, his sense of justice. In his second 
inaugural address, he blamed both the North and South—the South for its 
persistence in holding slaves; the North for its delay in driving slaves out 
of the land. He seemed to be far above the ordinary routine of life. He 
looked down on both sides, and he judged fairly. “Both read the same Bible,” 
he said, “and pray to the same God.” ~ 
TL. 
The play which follows, The Liberator, was written by the 
eighth grade of 1915, at the request of the Printing Department, 
to illustrate the power of the press. Its composition took a 
long time, and was possible only because of the background 
the class had gained in six weeks’ earnest work on Lincoln’s life 
and times. The eighth grade of 1918 chose to repeat it for the 
Lincoln Exercise.

Bradley. Don’t you do it, Tim. Hand out the Liberator. 
Tim. Yes, sir. Only have a few more left. 
Hezekiah Jenkins, Who is the publisher of this Liberator? 
McCarthy. A fellow named Garrison, a raving maniac on the subject 
of slavery. All day he sits in a dirty little hole that he calls the office of the 
Liberator, and sets up his worn-out old type. There aren’t two men in Bos- 
ton who wouldn’t pull a rope to stretch his neck. : 
Bradley. It’s false! There aren’t two other men in the country who 
could persevere under the public ridicule Garrison gets. (Picks up Libera- 
tor.) All these twenty years Garrison himself has been a slave. He is the 
kind of man that ought to be appreciated and loved, but he is hated and 
shunned. Look at the motto of the Liberator, “Our Country is the World; 
Our Countrymen are Mankind.” 
Mr. Thomas. You are right. Garrison is striving for a goal so far 
beyond common men we can’t see its glory. He’s above the mock of men; 
he sees before him a perfect land of freedom, and he strives toward it, 
though we alt pull back. It is not for nothing that he works day after day 
to get out the Liberator, Every free man in America is suffering with the 
slaves, while human beings are being held by their brothers as if they were 
dogs. 
Hopkins. Dogs? Garrison is a hound. He is ruining this country for 
the sake of a few ignorant blacks. Is that justice? The slave may deserve 
freedom, but the welfare of our country comes first. He is doing this only 
to make money—money ! , 
Thomas, Ruining our country, indeed! Mr. Garrison is ruining him- 
self, Though he has not a cent, he stands for the right. Though thousands 
are against him, he fights on. How long will civilized countries trade with 
a free country that sells men like dogs? It is the will of God that the slaves 
be free. Garrison is God’s messenger. 
Wilson. Who is this Garrison? 
James. Who is he? He’s the man who is stirring up the country. 
He’s the man that is making the North hate the South and the South hate 
the North. He's the man that’s spoiling business and splitting parties. And 
why is he doing it? Because he thinks that our constitution is a covenant 
with hell.’ And so he runs this crazy paper and makes his living by trying 
to cheat southern gentlemen of their maintenance. Yes, who’s Garrison? 
He’s a rat, a dirty rat, and he chooses that way of making his living. 
Bradicy, Look here. You can say all you like against Garrison’s cause, 
that’s your privilege, but you can’t attack his character. Garrison’s open 
and above-board; he’s working heart and soul for the blacks, and when the 
time comes he’ll free them.

McCarthy. So we have part of the underground railway corporation 
here? 
Bradley. Yes, sir, you have. If you keep us from doing the right above 
the ground, we'll do it underground. 
Hezekiah Jenkins (to Citizen). Are you for the niggers, too, sir? 
Wilson. Sir, I am for anything that helps our country to improve and 
progress, but I do not think that stirring up hatred within her boundaries will 
help to preserve her from the hatred that is ever without. Therefore, I 
say, let the slaves be slaves if it helps our country. In no time at all the 
slavery question has gone from bad to worse. We were a prosperous, 
peaceful country. We are now divided into two factions, each hating the 
other, each jealous of the other. 
Bradley. And do you think that it does help our country to have these 
poor wretches toiling in bondage, making the working whites despised and 
the gentlemen useless snobs? Do you think it is worthy of our country to 
pose as. free and hold human beings in cruel bondage? 
McCarthy. And if the nigger was free, what would he do but hinder 
the country, ruin the white laborer who will not work for low wages? And 
what kind of citizen will he make? 
Tim. Same kind you've taught him to make. 
Bradley. Righto! This thing has got to come sometime. 
Webster, But I say it doesn’t have to come. 
McCarthy. It'll dissolve the country if it does. 
Thomas. It will unite the country if it does. Our country at the 
present time is at a grave crisis, brother is turning against brother, family 
is turning against family, and the cause is simply this, that there are a few 
people, too many, who think that they are better than others who are of a 
different race. Is it possible that in this century a man is beaten like a 
hound? Is it possible to conceive the pain and agony of that cutting, biting 
rawhide whip? The day will come, and come soon, when the question will 
be decided. God help the right. 
Hezekiah Jenkins. How does Mr. Garrison dare print this paper when 
he has so many bitter enemies? 
Stickney. Why should he be afraid of any man living? This is a free 
country. We stand for free religion, free speech, a free press. 
Thomas. Ay, and free men. Nothing in this world or the next could 
dissuade Garrison from publishing this paper and preaching freedom. He is 
constant in purpose, though in danger of his life. Believe me, Garrison’s 
name will ring down the ages. He and his paper cannot perish. 
Baker, Here, boy, a Courier. 
Anthony. Yd like to choke Garrison to death and dump his press into 
the river. Here, boy, I'll give you twice what you make if you will quit 
handing out that Liberator all the time.

heaps of money out of it, too. 
Stickney, This paper makes me feel more every week that we are 
hampering our race, as well as the blacks, by slavery. 
Phillips. Yes, and the longer we keep them slaves, the less able they 
are to be free. 
Sherman. These radicals divide the country and make each side hate 
the other. Why, their howling has already lost a thousand votes for our 
party. A nice paper to be sold in the streets of Boston! 
Tim. Sure, people come and buy a paper, and the first thing I know 
they come back and throw it in my face. Then I sell it again. 
Webster. The slaves are personal property, such as no man has a right 
to take away. Garrison is like a fire on a great prairie. He must be 
stopped without delay, or we shall see the nation in a blaze. 
Phillips. Every word that that man writes is true. This is supposed to 
be a free country, but do you suppose we can make it so when almost one- 
third of our population is in bondage? 
Wilson, J believe in gradual emancipation. Set the young negroes free 
and educate them. But do you think it will help our country to free all these 
old ignorant blacks? 
Sherman. This paper has been going on for nearly twenty years. Must 
we tolerate this disgrace to Boston? I stand for the good of Boston—for the 
good of its citizens. I say this paper is a disgrace. 
Webster. The other day a man from St. Louis came to see me. He 
jeered, “How is your little comic paper, the Liberator? In St. Louis, when we 
mention Boston, we always get a laugh.” Shall this be said of our Boston? 
We ought to take his press and pull it up by a pulley, put him under, and

McCarthy. Let’s ask Mr. Anthony what he thinks. Mr. Anthony is 
candidate for Congress from our district. We ought to know his view. 
Hopkins, Hanson and Others. Speech, speech, Anthony! 
Inthony. You wish me to speak to you? 
Crowd. Yes. Speech, speech! 
Anthony, Fellow citizens, I have nothing to say to you. There is nothing 
to be said on this subject. You feel that— 
Webster, The slaves are property. 
Stickney, The slaves are human beings. 
Wilson. Our country comes first. 
Anthony. And I feel the same. I say the thing speaks for itself. It is 
not only the question of slavery that confronts us, it is not only the question 
of the welfare of Boston, but it is the question of the safety of our country. 
Here is this man Garrison, stirring up hatred, striving to separate our people, 
to weaken our defenses against foreign nations. What is there to be said 
about this? 
Mob, Nothing! Do something! Stop him! 
Anthony, Those negroes will work for low wages, starvation wages. 
Laborer. Down with the niggers! 
Anthony. If the South is on hostile terms with us they will not trade 
with us. 
Merchant. Down with the niggers! 
Anthony, If they are estranged from us, they will send their cotton to 
England. 
Manufacturer. Down with the niggers! 
Anthony, And the North itself will be turbulent. We shall not have 
unity of feeling. . 
Politician, Down with the niggers! 
Laborer. Down with the Liberator! It will ruin us. 
Anthony. Look at our country? Peaceful and progressing rapidly. 
What will happen when all those niggers are let loose? What will happen 
when we are divided in two, when our trade is divided, when our laborers 
and their families are starving? Men of Boston, you know Garrison; you 
know the Liberator. But I am thinking of the merchant; I am thinking of 
the laborer, If Garrison has his way, there will be war. I need not, I trust, 
remind you of our hard struggle for liberty and how our fathers framed the 
constitution. This man Garrison tore up the constitution because it did not 
abolish slavery, He is the man that is going to bring a great war on America. 
Every man that would have the country live, stop and think. Let the 
South refuse to trade with us, and what will that mean? It will mean bank- 
ruptcy, strikes, public disgrace. Garrison’s work will make trouble with the 
South.

Anthony. It's a disgrace to Boston. Every loyal citizen should think so. 
Garrison may mean well, but is Boston, is our country, to be ruined by well- 
meaning lunatics? Shall we put up with slander against President, constitu- 
tion, country, because there is a madman in the town? 
McCarthy. He is not mad. He’s as cool-headed as we are. 
Anthony. Not mad, do you say? Could any man in his senses wish 
to destroy his country, to weaken her so that European powers can seize 
her? The legislature of Georgia has offered a reward of $5,000 to any one 
who will kidnap Garrison and bring him to that state for trial. Citizens of 
Boston, shall we tolerate such a man in our city? It disgraces us and the 
whole North. Slavery is an old and established institution. Why should we 
disturb it? The editor of the Liberator is a coward and an enemy to men. 
If the slaves-are freed, who will do the work—who can do the work? Will 
it be done? No, 
Wilson. That's true. It sounds right. 
Bradley. Right? No, it’s wrong. It is all a lie. 
Anthony. Boys, there are a good many abolitionists in this town, but 
the worst is Garrison. He is stirring up the town to a dreadful riot. Oh, 
if I were but an orator I would rouse you to such a rage that you would-— 
James. We will. Let’s mob him, Let’s put a halter round his neck and 
drag him through the streets and show him to the people and say, “Here 
is the savior of the slaves!” 
Anthony. Stay, boys, don’t be rash. This Liberator is a fairly good 
looking paper, and Mr. Garrison has to make a living. Suppose it does say 
that the slaves should be free, and should vote, and that the slaves are human 
beings and are equal to us. 
James. Let’s throw his press into the river. 
Hopkins. Yes, and see if any of these wonderful black pets of his will 
heave it out for him,

Garrison. War, war! Nothing else but this bloody, terrible war.. Now 
a new battle is being fought, now more blood is being shed. And the worst 
of it is that all this might have been settled in a peaceful, civilized way 
instead of by a cruel and merciless war. The selfishness and hardness of 
men’s hearts is at the root of it all, making this war the bloodiest in all 
history. Civilized men today are worse than savages. 
Stickney. But look at our great men. Think of Lincoln— 
Garrison. Lincoln is the worst of them all, He is well called the slave 
hound of Illinois. I am busy now setting up an editorjal denouncing Lincoln 
for not proclaiming unconditional, immediate emancipation. I am aware that 
many object to the severity of my language, but is there not a cause for 
severity? I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice. I 
do not wish to think or speak or write with moderation. No! No! Tell 
a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm. Tell the mother 
to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen, but 
urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present. I am in earnest. 
I will not equivocate. I will not excuse. I will not retreat a single inch, and 
I will be heard. 
Stickney. You are wrong about Lincoln, Garrison. It has been your 
life work to free the slaves; but the burden of the nation at this terrible 
crisis has been upon his shoulders. He is the only man that God ever made 
who could steer the ship as he has steered it. 
Garrison, I cannot hope for much from that man. 
Stickney. Well, emancipation has to come sometime, and when it does 
we shall have you to thank, Fourteen years ago you were in peril of your

life. Now you hold public opinion in the hollow of your hand. You have 
slaved for the slave for thirty years. 
Garrison. And ii the slave is freed, I shall count that labor requited. 
How can any man who has the power to free the slave forbear? 
Stickney. Lincoln’s object is to save the Union. And it is beginning 
to look as if he were going to do it. 
(Enter mail carrier. Mrs, G. sorts mail.) 
Mrs. Garrison. Do you remember, Mr. Stickney, when his mail con- 
sisted mostly of threats against his life? Now it is full of complimentary 
and congratulatory letters, and we have new subscribers in every mail. 
Stickney. Yes, a great change has come over the people in the past 
thirty years. You used to be mobbed and hated. Now you are respected 
and loved. 
Garrison. I always believed that sooner or later people would begin to 
think more seriously about what I was saying. 
Mrs. Garrison, Where is the subscription book, William? 
Stickney. You'll have to buy some new type, I think. The issue is so 
large now, and so many people read it, that you ought not to use this worn- 
out old stuff. You deserve a lot of credit, Mr. Garrison, and your time is 
coming soon. This civil war is going to change something. It will end in 
victory for the North. It’s comin’ yet, for a’ that, and every slave will be free. 
Garrison. God grant it. When that happens my work is finished. 
(Enter Hezekiah Jenkins.) 
Tlezekiah. May I shake hands with you, Mr. Garrison? I’ve been read- 
ing the Liberator fourteen years. I bought my first one that day the broad- 
cloth mob nearly ended you and your newspaper career. My last one, too, 
it would have been, had it not been for a sharp little Irish newsboy on the 
street, 
Garrison, Yes, Tim saved my life that day. Tim’s in the army now, 
adjutant-colonel. 
Hezekiah, Well, I’ve got a boy at the front. That’s what brings me to 
Boston today. He must be fighting at Antietam this very minute. When 
do the latest bulletins come in? .

Garrison. J don’t understand. 
Mrs. Garrison. William, it has come at last. Those cheers outside were 
for you. Hear Tim’s telegram. “Mr. Lincoln has signed the proclamation. 
The slaves are free. Tim.” And here, William, William, listen! here is a 
telegram from Mr. Lincoln himself. (Reads) “Thanks and deep appreciation 
to the upholder of American freedom. You have taught the country that 
slavery is wrong. You have helped to make us all free, a United States, 
where all men are free and equal. Abraham Lincoln.”

(Garrison, after one long breath, turns suddenly to the case and begins to 
. work swiftly.) 
Garrison. Lincoln says this to me, and I thought him— 
Mrs. Garrison. What are you doing, William? 
Garrison. Destroying my words against Lincoln. Setting up the last 
issue of the Liberator. Dear friends, my life’s work is done. For over thirty 
years I have labored for the freeing of the slaves. Now they are free! Mr. 
Lincoln will carry on the war till he compels the South to give up their 
prey. Now I can die in peace. (Meanwhile other eager friends have crowded 
into the office, among them Thomas and Phillips.) 
Thomas. Your work done! It is hardly started. Your work will not 
be completed, nor will mine nor any other citizen’s until every foul pool of 
wickedness in this country is drained. 
Garrison. When the harvest is all reaped, do the laborers still stay in - 
the field? 
Mrs. Garrison. William, you must not stop. What will you eat, where 
will you sleep? 
Garrison. What do these trifles matter? My work is done. The slaves 
are free. 
Phillips. My friend, why do you stop? Even if the blacks are free, there 
are others who suffer in bondage. The white laborer still toils in chains. 
Long hours, small wages, tedious work, all help to make link after link of 
hardship. Mr. Garrison, your help and influence are needed. Will the 
Liberator refuse its powerful aid to this cause? 
Garrison. That is your work, not mine. Your work is still ahead of 
you; mine is now behind. It has been said of me that my only purpose in 
running this paper was to make my living. Shall I make it true? I began this 
work because the slave was a burden on my soul, His chain chafed my 
wrists. The lash which he felt drove me to darkest despair. And now, 
shall I work myself up over something else? No, I say my work is done. 
Anthony. But my dear Mr. Garrison. You have acquired so much 
influence. Why not enter politics in some worthy cause? Now, if you— 
Garrison, Ay, turn ‘the force used for helping the oppressed to assisting 
the oppressor. 
Anthony, My dear Mr. Garrison, you cannot be thinking of depriving 
the country of your paper, the fount. of truth and freedom? 
Garrison. My dear Mr. Anthony, fourteen years ago my paper was the 
Devil’s Bible, the fount of all hatred and falsehood. 
Anthony, Sir, I admit that fourteen years ago I, like many others, was 
in the wrong. But a statesman must he open to conviction. Your eloquence, 
sir, convinced me. 
Garrison. And my prominence. 
Anthony. . Your prominence, Mr. Garrison, is but the well deserved proof 
of your eloquence. You and your paper should enter politics. 
Garrison. Mr. Anthony, my paper has been devoted to a high and just 
cause. It shall never be the organ of hypocrisy and cupidity. Good day, sir.

Thomas. My dear friend, let me beg you not to discontinue the Liberator. 
From the cowardly, slaving negro you have made the brave freeman. Is 
there no more to be done? Must we lose your powerful influence? The 
earnest, thinking men of Boston look to the Liberator for guidance. The 
world cannot spare your noble paper. The Liberator and the Liberator’s 
maker are immortal. : 
Garrison. My friends, say no more. I am going to close shop forever. 
The slaves are free; their shackles broken. The work of the Liberator is 
done. The many weary days I have spent in this shop have not been spent in 
vain, The object I have so painfully sought is won, thanks to Mr. Lincoln, 
the purifier of this blood-stained country. I thought him incapable, and he 
congratulates me, thanks me, this President whom I thought a weakling. 
He has finished my task. Did I once have a picture of this man? (Finds one;

The poem which Benjamin, a member of the eighth grade, 
wrote, and which closes the Lincoln exercise of 1919, was Benjamin’s 
expression of the conviction of the whole class after their study of 
Lincoln: that Americans should study his character and carry on 
his teaching. It is this idea that they tried to convey throughout 
the exercise.

He cleft the rail, as did many of his followers, but he thought of higher 
things. Still, little did this humble rail-splitter realize how even Europe 
would cherish his name; little did he think that his picture would be in many 
a Russian peasant’s hut—the picture of an American peasant who lived to 
reach the very mountain-top of fame, to guide America through a dreadful 
war, to set her slaves free. To us he is living still, and when any great 
question comes to us, we turn to him. What would he do in the present 
crisis? 
Were Lincoln at the Peace Conference now, his would be the command- 
ing figure. 
An American poet gazed at the well known cast of Lincoln’s hand and 
wrote, .

rights, Lincoln, the world’s best friend? Perplexed and bewildered by 
baffling problems, we Americans instinctively turn to the great teacher of 
America, Abraham Lincoln. 
William. 
Is this great teacher, who guided America through the Civil War, helping 
to solve the problems that are arising in Europe? Yes, for his spirit thrills 
Americans to make the world safe for all people. It was his steady teaching 
that brought the full meaning of democracy to us. Amidst our perplexity 
and bewilderment before the great questions now to be settled, we fix on the 
way in which this humbly great man treated his enemies. “Let us judge not 
that we be not judged,” he said. But it hardly seems possible that we cannot 
punish the guilty one, the one ‘at whose cruel commands a heel of iron crushed 
those in the way of his blood-thirsty hordes. Would Lincoln say, as he 
said in 1865, “I hope there will be no persecution, no bloody work after this 
war is over. No one need expect me to take part in hanging or killing those 
men.” What would Germany do in our place? One dreads to think of it. 
Yet perhaps more may be taught by mercy than by punishment. While the 
world is bitter with revenge, we look for Lincoln’s example. Though on the 
bloody battlefields of war he knew his men had fallen fast, though he 
sympathized with the people at home over the loss of the brave men who 
struggled for the Union, at the end he was bitter toward none. In his second 
inaugural address he says, “Neither party expected for the war the magnitude 
or the duration which it has already obtained. Each looked for an easier 
triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same 
Bible and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.” 
“With malice toward none, with charity for all; with firmness in the 
right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work 
we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have 
borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may 
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all 
nations.” 
Robert. 
Tf Lincoln were at the peace table, can we imagine what his great mind 
would think or his tongue would speak? Would he want revenge on the. 
German people? Would he not think of himself in their places? Would he 
not consider whether it was the fault of the people that this war came on? I 
dare say he would remark, in his quaint way, that it reminded him—and then 
would come one of Lincoln’s inimitable stories. Why had these simple stories 
so much power and force? Many a long discussion, many 2 heated argument, 
he forestalled by one of these homely tales. The opponent was won, his 
ill humor dissolved. 
Every one knows that after Booth’s cruel bullet had done its deed, all 
of Lincoln’s noble, kindly ideas were put aside, and hateful plans of revenge 
against the foe were taid. Military governors were placed at the head of 
the states and deprived the people of their just rights. A law was made that 
all those who had borne arms against the Union were barred from holding  
-P-A-G-E-118
Srupres in EpucaTiIon 83 
public office. Carpet-baggers took possession of the crippled South, and 
with their cunning persuaded the ignorant negroes to vote for them. The 
South was so paralyzed that the work of reconstruction was almost impos- 
sible. During this time the Ku-Klux Klan was organized. They made it 
their duty to punish and harass the negroes. Sometimes they hung and killed 
innocent negroes. This could have been prevented if the military governors 
had filled their offices properly. A second great mistake was in allowing all 
the negroes to vote. This was far from being Lincoln’s plan. He wished to 
give the vote to all negroes of superior intelligence, and to those who had 
fought in the armies of the North. The rest he would have made apprentices, 
taught good trades, and given them the vote as their intelligence justified it. 
If Lincoln’s assassination could have been averted these mistakes and many 
others would have been prevented. If Lincoln had lived, the bitter feeling in 
the South and the persecution of the rebels would have been avoided. So 
now, in this great reconstruction period, let us study the ideas of Lincoln and 
prevent, as far as possible, bitter feeling throughout the world. 
I see Lincoln at the Peace Conference, pleading for a worthy judgment. 
I hear him rebuke the man who urges revenge; I hear him say that there 
were many men responsible for the conflict, and that, “If we had tried to 
wipe out that black cloud long ago, there would never have been such an 
enduring war.” I hear him urge, everything to help civilization and nothing 
to hinder it. If Lincoln’s teachings have reached us, we shall think before 
we take revenge. “It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task 
remaining before us; that this world under God shall have a new birth of 
freedom.” 
felen. 
The great task remaining before us is world peace—not an armed peace 
like the last, but real peace. We must not have another war. When we think 
of the horrors of the recently ended conflict, we foresee the power. of 
destruction of a future war. The earth will not be a fit habitation for men. 
Much of the fighting will be done by inanimate things, striving to conquer 
and destroy other lifeless monsters. All the age-long struggle for con- 
struction will be cast aside by the pitiless arm of destruction. Gas will be 
invented that will not only kill all life, but destroy buildings as well. Deadly 
artillery will wipe men off the face of the earth, seconded by such improved’ 
airplane bombing that an army of men must needs be employed to stand 
day and night, telescope in hand, or ready with anti-aircraft device, to prevent 
a sudden attack on the coasts. Overwhelming taxes will have to be imposed 
to support the armies. 
The farmer, the weaver, the builder, all the men upon whom we lean 
for food, clothing, shelter, will leave their plows, their looms, their mills, for 
the gun, the tank, the bomb. The great beast of war crawling from its den. 
will breathe death on men in the ftefd and children at home. 
If all this horror, bloodshed, and expense can be averted by a democratic 
league of nations, would Lincoln allow the Peace Conference to fail? Lincoln 
was not a man of war, though he “would accept war rather than let the 
nation perish.” But he believed that the people could rule.

“Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of 
the people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? 
“Our popular government has often been called an experiment. Two 
points in it our people have already settled—the successful establishing and 
the successful administering of it. One still remains—its successful main- 
tenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it. It is now 
for them to demonstrate to the world that ballots are the rightful and peace- 
ful successors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly and constitution- 
ally decided, there can be no successful appeal back to bullets. Such wilt 
be a great lesson of peace: teaching men that what they cannot take by an 
election, neither can they take it by a war; teaching all the folly of being 
the beginners of a war.” 
Josephine. : 
So with the other great problems of the peace table. What is to be done 
about Russia? How are the claims of the Balkan States to be adjusted? 
How are the boundary disputes among the various new countries to be 
settled? What can the League of Nations do to protect uncivilized people? 
Every question requires a vast knowledge, but no knowledge will be of use 
without Lincoln’s scorn of trickery, his patience, his faith in humanity, his 
humility. If America can make these qualities her own, she can so powerfully 
support Mr. Wilson, that no wiliness, no dishonesty, no secret belief in the 
war and revenge, and militarism can. withstand America’s demands.’ Because 
we believe America is trying to do this, we say: 
He can sleep now. His great free soul can rest. His hours of work 
are not in vain. Kings are no more, and war has ceased. Peace is laying 
hold on the souls of the people. The world of peasant-folk is released. The 
shining hope of Europe free has come. Kings no more quarrel and slaughter. 
The great idea has come to the whole world. The people understand that no 
one can be free unless all are free. But a short time ago, the toil and 
travail of Lincoln seemed in vain. But warriors have turned to the work 
of the peaceful plow. A new era has begun. May peace rest on this earth 
forever. 
Benjamin. 
Oh, mourning figure, can men say that yet you mourn; 
That yet your hours of grief and care endure; 
That yet your lessons are not taught? 
No, yet you live, 
For how could we forget the weight of all your teachings?

ADAPTATION IN THE CONTENT OF HIGH SCHOOL 
SCIENCE , 
  
The principle that the needs of society determine the work of 
the school includes as a corollary the necessity for constant 
adaptation in the processes of education, since the determining 
needs of society are undergoing a constant evolution. However, 
the tendency of teachers, of school administrators, and of the 
entire educational system, is to oppose change and to crystallize 
both the subject-matter of the curriculum and the methods of 
presenting it. ‘ 
As a result adaptation does not take place smoothly and 
continuously, but suddenly, with resulting strain and disturb- 
ance. The war, which revealed many failures in co-ordinating 
the work in school with life outside of it, precipitated a period 
of general reorganization in education. The lessons of the war 
have emphasized the duty of the schoo! to provide a real training 
for the responsibilities of citizenship, resting upon broad under- 
standing and intelligent insight. As a result of this pressure, 
all subjects in the high school curriculum are seeking to justify 
their continued existence through the contributions which each 
makes toward training the socially efficient being, the good 
citizen. 
It is not the purpose of this paper to present in a merely 
academic way the value of science study in training the future 
citizen of the world for the intelligent discharge of his duties.* 
Rather, it is the purpose to describe some ways and means which 
‘have been used in the class room, laboratory and general life of 
the school to render science study a vital factor in the lives of 
the pupils and to secure a larger measure of flexibility in the 
science courses and a better adaptation to individual interests 
and needs. / 
UTILIZING THE MORNING EXERCISE OR SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 
Good citizens are active in placing valuable information at the 
disposal of their fellows. So in school the science classes can do a

great deal towards actively sharing ideas and interesting facts with 
the rest of the school body. This finds a ready response in the gen- 
eral ‘interest shown in scientific phenomena, and the eagerness to 
understand the demonstrations and explanations. In this school 
the daily morning exercise* furnishes the best opportunity for 
efforts of such a nature. Recently the chemistry class gave a series 
of four exercises. These exercises served to arouse interest in 
science in general and chemistry in particular; to stimulate pupils 
to thinking and perhaps experimenting at home and in leisure time; 
to illustrate the content of the chemistry course and to some extent 
to encourage pupils to elect science courses another year; to furnish 
the school with information on important topics. 
The titles and outlines of these exercises are given in some 
detail.

other cities. 
Il. CHEMICAL MAGIC 
This exercise consisted of a series of spectacular experiments per- 
formed in such a way as to mystify the audience and challenge their 
ability to find a satisfactory explanation. It was gotten up by a small 
group of the class, more as a chemical vaudeville entertainment than a 
regular exercise in chemistry. 
A variety of indicators and reagents were used to turn water into 
wine and back again, convert a large jar of apparent ink into clear water, 
a portion of which was drunk, and to produce other striking color 
changes. Sympathetic ink was devised and used to predict magically 
the outcome of an election to be held on the morrow. For this purpose 
the writing had been done upon large sheets of paper with a solution of

potassium sulphocyanate. The messages were caused to appear by spray- 
ing the paper with a dilute solution of a ferric salt from a fine atomizer. 
Explosive soap bubbles were formed by blowing the air through a 
concealed bottle containing a little gasoline. With the use of a spot light 
on a darkened stage a striking effect was produced. 
An unlighted cigarette was apparently smoked, whereupon the smoke 
was caused to appear in a large bell jar upon the table. Ammonia and 
acid fumes, used with a little sleight of hand, accomplished this. 
Large round filter papers had been previously treated with a solution 
of potassium nitrate. These were suspended in proper order and each 
one was set off with the red hot tip of a file. The Jetters burned out, 
spelling the word “Chemistry.” 
Water, poured into an apparently empty pan, was set on fire. This 
effect was produced by igniting a concealed cloth saturated with alcohol, 
by means of a small bit of potassium. 
The final trick involved the calling down of “fire from heaven.” 
Red and green fire were ignited by electric spark from a concealed spark 
coil and at the same time the national emblem dropped across the rear 
of the stage. 
Ill. EXPLOSIVES 
Introduction—Explosion defined as rapid burning and an explosive as 
an intimate mixture or combination of oxygen and a fuel. 
Gunpowder.—Composition and burning explained. Gun-cotton; com- 
position and burning explained. Comparison of volumes of gases 
by equal amounts of gunpowder and dynamite illustrated by the use 
of charts. Meaning of high explosives made clear. 
Explosives in Warfare—T.N.T. as a type of modern high explosive, used 
in shells. 
Motion Picture—Farming with Dynamite (reel loaned by Du Pont de 
Nemours Company) showing interesting uses of dynamite on the 
farm, 
IV. NITROGEN 
Composition of the Air—Rough analysis performed as an experiment. 
Calculation of weight of nitrogen in air resting on the roof of the 
Auditorium immediately over the heads of the audience. 
Nitrogen.—lIts inertness illustrated by experiment. An essential life- 
giving element. The nitrogen cycle explained by colored blackboard 
diagrams. 
Problem of Nitrogen Fixation——Relation to explosives in warfare. Gov- 
“ernment plants in the United States and their significance for the 
future welfare of the country. 
These outlines show how civic and national problems may be 
drawn upon to furnish interesting work for a class, and how the 
ideas of the whole school may be clarified by a suitable morning 
exercise growing out of such studies.

THE STUDY OF CURRENT SCIENTIFIC EVENTS 
During the war the rapid development of all sorts of scientific 
devices furnished an especially strong motive for the study of cur- 
rent events in the field of applied science. Every member of the 
science classes was eager to learn all he could about submarines, 
airplanes, machine guns, gas warfare and so forth, and this interest 
was by no means confined to the science classes. To take advantage 
of this desire and of similar interests along other lines, the whole 
high school was organized into groups, according to their major 
interests, science, military strategy, war literature, relief work, 
political developments.* 
The science section was so large that further sub-division accord- 
ing to interests was possible. Groups were formed to study aero- 
nautics, gas warfare, submarine construction and warfare, artillery 
developments, and methods of camouflage. The section met weekly 
at a regular period to hear reports from these groups, or to listen 
to outside speakers, of whom we were fortunate to hear a number 
on interesting topics. These included talks on “The Emergency 
lleet Corporation,” by a member of that organization ; “The Train- 
ing of an Aviator,” by an instructor in that branch of the service; 
“Lighting and Signaling Devices,” by a patent lawyer, and “War 
Experiences,” by a number of returning graduates and friends of 
the school. The time was never permitted to drag, and usually more 
reports were ready than could be presented. Questions were 
numerous and interesting, though often information that would 
make the answers adequate was lacking. The responsibility for the 
meetings was readily assumed by the pupils in a way which showed 
their deep interest. The reports by pupils included the following: 
History of Aviation; Flying Stunts; Types of Military Planes ; Mus- 
tard Gas; The Gas Mask; Development of the Machine Gun; 
Thermit, with demonstration experiments, and many others. 
The intense interest in the military aspects of science evaporated 
with the coming of peace, but the same plan is now being continued 
for the study of current scientific developments and of the indus- 
trial aspects of science., This supplements more closely the work of 
the physics and chemistry classes, and so provides for a closer 
articulation of the science of the classroom and laboratory with that 
of industry and commerce.

ing topics which may be drawn upon for illustrative and informa-

Such topics as these are not new in courses in physics and 
chemistry, but the emphasis on them and the number of them should 
be greatly increased if science study is to have that quality of 
reality essential to educative activity. Courses of study in science 
have a marked tendency to crystallize into a static state. This is 
perhaps due to the nature of science material, which lends itself to 
easy classification and organization. There is ever the danger that 
the teacher, content with teaching the system, the classification, may 
miss the vital connections by which the facts of science become 
significant and full of meaning to the pupil. 
Successful science teaching in the changing world of today 
requires a flexible course of study, the use of a wide range of 
projects, problems, and applications, making possible a closer adapta- 
tion to local conditions and individual interests and needs. Teachers 
of science have failed to keep the content of their courses up to 
date; they have lost contact with the latest discoveries and applica- 
tions in which the pupils are often most interested. These faults 
mist be corrected if science study is to accomplish its great purpose 
and become as vital in the life of the school as it is in the life 
outside. . 
  
*Just prior to the war a number of high school boys organized and equipped 
a very successful Wireless Club. A small building on the school grounds was 
assigned to their use. This was thoroughly overhawed by the boys and an excellent 
set of instruments had just been installed when the government closed all amateur 
stations. The apparatus was donated to the school upon the graduation of most of 
the club members a year ago. A new club has now been formed by the boys of 
the physics class to carry on the study of this project. It is open, under certain 
conditions, to other high school boys.

NEW MATERIAL IN MODERN LANGUAGE WORK 
Nore: This article was completed by Mr. Merrill only a short time 
before his sudden death, November 1, 1919. It is indeed tragic that his life 
was cut short at a time when the influence of his ideals was spreading 
rapidly, through the publications described in the article. It is to be hoped 
that some way will open for the continuance of a work so valuable to modern 
language teaching throughout the country. The following excerpt from the 
memorial statement, in the third number of Le Monde Frangais, will show 
how generously he gave himself to the fulfillment of his ideals. 
  “Mr. Merrill gave all of his time, outside of his teaching, to these publica- 
tions, and they reflect the painstaking devotion he gave to them. He spared 
neither time nor expense in making them as perfect-and as progressive 
educationally as possible. His summers were spent in travel and study on 
the continent, and lately in Cuba and Porto Rico, gathering material for the 
new issues. Nothing is more indicative of the thoroughness which character- 
ized Mr. Merrill’s work than the large force of collaborators he called in to 
help in editing and criticizing the material selected for publication. Surely 
the ideas for which he strove survive, and his work for the improvement of 
the teaching of modern languages will keep his memory alive through many 
years to come.” 
In order to make the modern language work responsive to the 
special needs of the pupils, we hold to the ideal of selecting topics 
as far as possible associated with subjects of special interest to the 
child. Since the teachers are free, so Jong as they observe the col- 
lege entrance requirements, to use any methods or present any 
topics for discussion which are believed to be worth while, many 
points of contact have been found between the modern language 
work and the work of other departments. We believe in examining 
closely the work and play of a grade in order to discover profitable 
connections between it and the teaching of a modern language. 
While many opportunities have escaped us, and while not all the 
teachers have been able to plan their work along this special line, 
nevertheless, as we look back over the years of the school’s existence, 
many examples occur to us showing the relation of a modern 
language to a grade activity. 
At the very beginning of the course, in the work of all primary 
grades, the point of contact is play rather than work. Therefore, 
games in which a foreign language is spoken or sung are intro-

are typical of games played by the youngest children. he children 
delight in the opportunity. to express themselves in a foreign lan- 
guage when this expression is a part of some interesting activity. 
With geography many obvious points of contact exist, and a 
vast amount of intensive work has been accomplished at different 
times during the school’s history. In the grammar grades much. 
supplementary work has been done on such subjects as Brittany, 
Normandy, the Tell country, and the Black Forest. The high school 
Spanish classes have studied life in Cuba, Porto Rico, Spain, and 
other countries where the language is spoken. Of course maps 
and charts are constantly in use in all high school work. In addi- 
tion, special leaflets have been prepared by some of the teachers and 
used from year to year in the classes. 
The study of certain periods of history has also been enriched 
by the modern language work. Seventh grade classes studying the 
time of chivalry enjoyed in their language work stories of the typical 
mediaeval heroes, Roland, Charlemagne, Siegfried. Pictures, per- 
sonal souvenirs of travel, and wall charts, showing life in the olden 
times in peace and war, illustrated these discussions. 
With music, the associations are many and delightful. Folk- 
songs and songs for special occasions, particularly Christmas, are 
always great favorites. For years no Christmas celebration was 
complete without the singing of beautiful old songs of the countries 
whose languages were studied. The war modified this tradition to 
some extent. 
Senior classes have found it decidedly worth while to devote 
some time in their modern language work to scientific reading. Boys 
keenly interested in chemistry are especially eager for this work 
arid often acquire considerable proficiency in reading German texts 
on the subject. 
For years it has been customary for the students in certain 
modern language classes to devote a good deal of attention to rapid 
reading without translation, in order to gain a feeling of power in 
the use of the language, but particularly in order to increase their 
appreciation of literature. In some groups each student pursues a 
different course of reading but makes frequent reports to the class 
on the work done or the problems encountered. Each pupil is 
encouraged to read books which he can understand, on subjects 
which to him are of special interest. Gradually and very encourag-

ingly the power of reading without translation is developed. Pupils 
accomplish a good deal of this reading during the long summer 
vacation, a few even finding pleasure in additional study of the 
classics. 
In the three modern languages taught at the school, a vigorous 
international correspondence has brought about a more vivid appre- 
ciation of life in the great foreign world. The first exchange of 
letters was arranged some ten or twelve years ago between pupils 
in our high school and young people in German schools. For the 
past year or so a fairly brisk correspondence has been going on be- 
tween our pupils and French, Cuban, Porto Rican or Spanish boys. 
and girls. Similar letters are planned to include German Switzer- 
land. , 
The arrangements for the Spanish correspondence with Cuba. 
were made through personal friends of the writer. At the start all 
pupils, even in high school classes, have written in the mother tongue 
on topics presumed to be of special interest to the correspondent in 
question. Pictures, postcards, and newspaper clippings were en- 
closed. The next step in the correspondence will be the writing of 
letters in Spanish, with the hope of receiving the native correspond- 
ents’ criticism of idiom and construction. 
Through the Department of Public Instruction in Porto Rico, 
several correspondents in San Juan high schools were secured. A 
teacher in this city suggested to the Porto Rican boys that they 
should write as to an intimate friend—using the intimate form of 
address—and should tell their new friends of interesting happenings 
on the island and customs of native life. A typical letter, written 
by a Porto Rican boy to his friend at the Parker School, follows: 
Mi queridisimo amigo: 
Recibi la tuya, la cual me causé gran alegria, pues ya yo creia que mi 
carta se habia perdido. 
Me alegraria mucho, si pudieras dar un viaje a Puerto Rico, para que 
veas nuestra islita. Todos los extranjeros que vienen aqui la encuentran 
muy bonita,

por lo tanto tienen que venir a caballo. La yerba que ponen en dicha caja 
es para que los caballos se alimenten antes de regresar al cielo.

regresado, los cuales hemos recibido con gran entusiasmo. Todavia falta por

In order to secure suitable addresses from Spain, Argentine, and 
Mexico, letters were written to American consular officials. Cour- 
teous replies were received, giving the names of teachers or schools 
interested in the subject of international correspondence. One of 
the young men from that city sent views of Barcelona, so that his 
new friend “might admire a little this beautiful city.” 
The greater part of the recent correspondence in French had its 
origin in societies for the relief of the fatherless children of France 
and in other welfare organizations. When the school decided to 
adopt a number of French war orphans, letters were interchanged 
in order that our pupils might learn more definitely of the needs and 
desires of the children they wished to help. Through the courtesy 
of Mrs. Walter Brewster, 741 Fine Arts Building, Chicago, the 
school was given a list of children needing assistance. Soon a very 
interesting correspondence developed between the French and 
American children . The following is a letter received by one of our 
pupils : . 
Fécamp, le 8 Décembre 1918. 
L’armistice est 14. Tout le monde est joyeux. On ne peut pas circuler 
sur les routes. Tout le monde est en féte, mais notre pauvre mére est 
restée chez nous a pleurer sachant que nous n’ayons plus notre pére. Toutes 
les maisons sont pavoisées, toutes les églises sonnent, les vapeurs sifflent et 
partout on tire le canon. Chacun se précipite avec des drapeaux a la main 
et crie: “Vive la France!” 
La vie est trés chére, mais dans notre ville il y a toujours du travail. 
En ce moment nous avons la péche du hareng qui rapporte beaucoup et 
occupe bien des vieillards, des femmes et des enfants. 
Votre petit filleul Justin a huit ans, il va tous les jours a Pécole malgré 
son jeune age. Il remercie beaucoup sa marraine en Amérique et gardera 
toujours:son nom gravé dans son petit cceur. 
I add another letter, expressing the gratitude of French soldiers 
for interest in their welfare:

painting become more vital if correlated with other work in which 
the children are interested. One or two illustrations will serve to 
indicate the freedom of correlation which is true of almost all of the 
art work in this school.

      ART-ROOM CHAIR DECORATED WITH MAGIC SQUARE DESIGN 
The eighth grade boys were making posters for the use of the 
English department in “Better Speech Week” in the school. After
-P-A-G-E-133
130 Francis W. PaRKER SCHOOL 
studying the human figure in silhouette from life poses, the pupils 
made use of their ink sketches for the posters by enlarging, com- 
posing, and lettering them. The girls of the same grade planned 
to make new curtains for their room. With this motive in mind they 
sketched and made cuttings of flowers, studying color and arrange- 
ment in relation to the color of the walls and furniture of the room. 
The ninth grade has painted and decorated the desks in the 
art room to harmonize with the walls and screens, and with the 
chairs, which had been previously decorated by another class. This 
demanded much work and study of general problems of design as 
well as their application to the room and its furniture. The desks 
were taken to the shop and painted under the direction of the teacher 
of manual training. The decorative designs were based on lines of 
the Magic Square.* Here the interest and help of the teacher of 
mathematics gave the pupils a constructive basis for design, and. 
stimulated a fresh interest in it. 
The children of the fresh air room, who own a pet goat, 
have written the story of his life and are making a book with many 
illustrations, It is called “Billy’s Autobiography.” The pictures 
made by the children show Billy traveling, writing, reading, playing, 
and eating. Billy himself came to the art room—although it is 
located on the third floor—to superintend the work. After the 
illustrations were made, they were painted with asphaltum on 
zinc plates by the children in the art room. From there, they 
were taken to the print shop to be etched in acid and printed. The 
children did this work under supervision of the teacher of printing. 
They are now designing a cover which will be suggestive of the 
contents. 
The twelfth grade, who in their English course are studying 
the drama, come to the art room to plan stage settings, furniture, 
and costumes. When they have made satisfactory drawings, plans 
or paintings, they go to the shop to make the furniture they are 
to use in presenting their plays, to the home economics teacher to 
*The Magic Square is of ancient origin. It is an arrangement in the form of 
a square, of numbers which when added vertically, horizontally, and diagonally give 
the same sum. The Magic Line, upon which the designs are based, is a line drawn 
connecting the consecutive numbers in any of the many Magic Squares. Albrecht 
Diirer put in his etching called “Melancolia” a most remarkable Magic Square of 4. 
In India the Magic Square is the basis of a design on the gate of the fort at 
Givalior and was often used in decorations on balconies and doorways, as well as in 
the ornamentation of garments.

make their costumes, and finally to the stage to produce the play. 
The varied types of work in the building up of the final effect, and 
the co-operation of the different departments in the common cause, 
greatly enrich the whole project. 
I could go on and on giving instances in which the art work 
is part of the actual substance of the work in other departments. 
But the principle controlling all of these instances is the same. The 
correlation must not come in response to an artificially worked 
up demand, but must come as the necessary means of dealing with 
a real situation. If this is the case the value and interest of it for 
the children are without question, the motive for design—whether 
it be sawing, painting, sewing, reading, dramatizing, singing, or 
any other form of school activity—is sustained by a vital and last- 
ing interest, aid good technique, demanded by the purpose of the 
project, is gained easily and joyfully.

MUSIC MOODS IN PASTEL AND CHARCOAL 
Beauty and its all-absorbing, fundamental experiences and 
expressions are surely essential to a well rounded life. Acknowl- 
edgment of this truth leads to the conviction that into the lives of 
children while they are growing should be poured a great store of 
opportunities for varied aesthetic experiences. Especially is it 
important to open the way for such experiences before the more 
formal technical work has crystallized into a habit, before it becomes 
next to impossible for the children to forget for a moment the 
conventional expression of an acquired technique. 
When this basic experience is not provided early in children’s 
training, a superficial type of thought often becomes their fixed _ 
habit. In such cases honest expression of individual mood never 
becomes articulate ; consequently the child’s actual expression loses 
power and beauty by submission to commonplace standards. Insin- 
cerity is encouraged, and the child’s development of power of obser- 
vation, perception, and expression is limited. If aesthetic experience 
is presented so that the children are quite free and all are interested, 
they will have no fear of seeming strange and they will feel that it 
is desirable and that it is a privilege to express their deepest feelings. 
This belief, and the privilege of freedom in planning my course 
of study and of adapting it to the needs of each and every one, 
gave me the idea of presenting to my high school classes the follow- 
ing experience. A class of twenty high school boys and girls, with 
some appreciation and skill in drawing and painting, were invited to 
hear some beautiful music. I had consulted the Music Department 
and had listened to many piano compositions before selecting what 
seemed to me the most stirring and suggestive of all the subjects 
offered—one with a theme or pattern which might awaken the 
imagination and give the children a vision. I put paper and colored 
chalk within reach of the pupils, and told them that they might 
draw, if they felt like it, after listening to the music, but I especially 
emphasized the fact that they need not do this unless they desired to. 
They were to listen with a sense of leisure and with all possible joy, 
and to feel entirely free.

-P-A-G-E-136
Srupies in EpucaTIon 133 
This group of pupils had studied design for one year and had 
been given opportunities during that time to experiment freely both 
in making original variations with assigned subjects and in working 
out their own ideas. They also knew something of the science and 
symbols of color. They were told that it was as natural a process 
to convey one’s impression of a beautiful, harmonious sound as to 
convey one’s impression of any beautiful material thing, such as a 
flower, a face, or a landscape. 
Claude Bragdon says in his Architecture and Democracy that 
there is a great difference between music and color as art mediums: 
that music is a “seeking,” while color is a “finding”; that one finds 
a prolonged musical note intolerable, because the ear demands change 
and variation; while on the other hand, because the eye calls for 
repose, one can enjoy a clear blue sky all day and every day. Not- 
withstanding these contrasting forms of experience derived from 
the two mediums music and color, there is a certain unity in their 
emotional appeal. It is possible to give some expression of the 
effect of one in terms of the other. This process is valtiable to those 
who have made a study of it and who use it or guide it with wisdom. 
The musical impressions worked out by these pupils were put 
on a screen in the-art room and left there several days, for enjoy- 
ment, but not for criticism. They were so varied that there was 
little temptation to make critical comparisons. I often heard remarks 
like the following: “L. felt entirely different from C. Just look at 
her heavy, rich coloring, while his is quiet, in purples and blues.” 
These simple, direct mood drawings ate very interesting in color 
and composition, and many of, them possess real beauty. They are 
precious in a very particular way, for they reveal unrealized quali- 
ties and powers in each child. Moreover, after such. an experi- 
ence, pupils invariably express themselves more freely; they seem 
to have lost fear and restraining self-consciousness; even the most 
sensitive ones gain confidence. The opportunity to express music 
moods in color should, however, not be permitted often—possibly 
only two or three times a year. After the first time it seems better 
to wait until the pupils ask for another opportunity. The experi- 
ence gives such keen pleasure that this request is almost sure to 
come. 
I have found that this kind of experience possesses certain def- 
inite values in art education. It calls forth a true expression of each 
child’s individuality and mood. It helps to cultivate discrimination,

taste, and appreciation of the different kinds of art. It marks a 
beginning of a feeling for the beautiful in its essence, whether it 
be expressed in abstract design or in the representation of natural, 
familiar forms. And it never fails to teach that art is the expression 
of self through form or color or other medium, rather than merely 
a reproduction of nature or life.

DALCROZE EURYTHMICS 
  
“Tt is encouraging to remember that many of the educational ideas 
which germinated in the years preceding each earlier period of Euro- 
pean war survived the time of struggle and proved their vitality in the 
following age of reconstruction. Comenius, though himself a victim of 
the wars of the seventeenth century, influenced by his writings the 
educational outlook of a later age. Rousseau’ and Pestalozzi leavened 
the school practices of the nineteenth century. And the methods of 
Jaques-Dalcroze, though for the time checked in their more extended 
application by the calamities of the war, have taken firm root, and with 
the help of those who are now fostering and developing them in Eng- 
land will have strong influence in the educational movement which 
promises to follow the restoration of peace.” 
M. E. Sadler, The Eurythmics of Jaques-Dalcrose, Introduction. 
The introduction of Dalcroze Eurythmics into the Francis W. 
Parker School, with its full and varied program and unusual num- 
ber of special features, compels an analysis of its operation and aims 
in order to prove that it does not trespass upon the work of the well 
established departments of physical education and music, and that 
it has a value of its own which warrants its inclusion in a crowded 
curriculum. 
Only one branch of the method as taught by Emile Jaques- 
Dalcroze is given in the Francis W. Parker School, namely, rhythmic 
gymnastics, or “the corporal study” of musical rhythm. The other 
two branches of the method, ear-training and improvization, are not 
included in the work now given to the first four grades and the 
freshman girls. 
Eurythmics belongs in the domain of pedagogical gymnastics, 
but it includes, as well, fundamental musical education. It was his 
search for better methods of musical education which Jéd M. 
Jaques-Dalcroze to the discovery that the sense of rhythm and meas- 
ure could be developed by movements of the body in time to music; 
that “there is an intimate relation between rhythm in sound and 
rhythm in the body.” 
The division of time in music into pulses corresponds to equal 
divisions of space. To illustrate this by stepping, marching, run- 
ning, leaping, springing, or skipping, according to the tempo and 
rhythm of the music, is the first lesson in rhythmic gymnastics. Free 
movement governed only by music, and the habit of attention, are 
141
-P-A-G-E-145
142 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
the points to be gained by these first exercises. The music, in order 
to compel this attention, must be improvised by the teacher, chang- 
ing frequently its accents, tempi, and quality of tone. Accelerando, 
ritardando, crescendo, diminuendo, the different touches, are all 
capable of expression by the body in quickened or retarded move- 
ment; in inhalation and exhalation accompanied by muscular ten- 
sion and relaxation; in erect, tense, contracted, or relaxed positions 
of the body while marching. 
The infinite possibilities of this kind of exercise will not be 
apparent to one who thinks of rhythm as a monotonous, metronomic 
regularity of beat, like the ticking of a clock. Jaques-Dalcroze lays 
emphasis upon the great variety of musical rhythm—rhythms forgot- 
ten by the composers of the so-called classic period. Changes 
of measure, unusual times like 54, 74, 156, etc., are studied, as well as 
more common kinds of measure; syncopation, phrasing, also coun- 
terpoint, canon, fugue, three against two, and three against four. 
Measure is taught in the Dalcroze method by beating time with 
the arms, as a conductor leads an orchestra. The first beat of a 
measure, the down beat or strong beat, brings the arms down to 
their full length, with a contraction of all the muscles. The remain- 
ing weak beat’ or beats are made by extending the arms with a 
stretching movement to the side, forward, or upward. This mus- 
cular contraction, expansion and relaxation, dividing space, is a 
very apt illustration of rhythm, which is defined by Webster as 
“a dividing of time into short portions by a regular succession of 
motions, impulses, or sounds.” 
Inhibition or spontaneity exercises, in which a movement which 
has become automatic is checked on command or is changed to 
another movement, were introduced into his system by Jaques- 
Dalcroze upon his discovery that the movements designed to be 
executed to music were performed by the majority of beginners 
either a little too late or too soon. To overcome the resistance 
which produces the one fault and the lack of control and balance 
which ,causes the other, these exercises are given in each lesson, 
increasing in difficulty as the pupils attain greater physical and 
mental control and co-ordination. Thus hearing, thinking and act- 
ing become one three-fold process, as the elements of friction, inac- 
curacy of hearing, slowness of thought, nervousness or awkward- 
ness, are eliminated. The mere checking or inhibiting of an action 
is of no value except as it is accomplished with perfect ease, in
-P-A-G-E-146
Stupies In EpucaTIion 143 
ordered rhythm, without confusion or discomposure. 
A tremendous power of co-ordination is demanded by the com- 
bination of arm motions (for beating time) with marching and 
accent. All note values, from the fraction of a beat to 4 whole note 
of twelve beats, must be learned as one learns the alphabet or the 
multiplication table. These note values are illustrated by steps 
corresponding to the duration of sound of the note. Thus a quarter 
note is a step to one beat of the arms; eighth note, two steps to 
one beat, etc. Half notes are represented by a step on the first beat 
and a bend of the knee on the second beat; dotted half notes, by a 
step and two points with the free foot, while three beats are made 
with the arms. 
“The realization of rhythms,” as it is called in rhythmic gym- 
nastics, is literally to make real or visible in movement a musical 
measure or phrase which is being heard by the pupil. This rhythm 
may be one, two, three, or four measures long. It may be played 
several times before the pupil is able to realize it correctly, but 
later the pupil will be able to realize, after one playing, and will form 
a canon with the piano, realizing each measure after it has been 
played without pause, hearing the second measure while realizing the 
first. This form of canon is called “a realization chain.” 
Beating in canon shows dissociation of the bodily members 
by beating with one arm four-four or any number of beats, coming 
in with the other arm one or more beats behind. This independence 
of movement is also shown by simultaneously beating three with 
one arm, four with the other, two by moving the head down and up, 
and five by stamping the feet on the first of every five steps. 
Equipped with bodily control, with the capability of “respond- 
ing to artistic rhythms and realizing them quite naturally without 
fear of exaggeration,” the pupil finds his vocabulary of movement 
ready to use in expressing himself. M. Jaques-Dalcroze writes: 
“The result of this education ought to be to put the completely 
developed faculties of the individual at the service of art and to 
give the latter the most subtle and complete of interpreters, the 
human body. For the body can become a marvelous instrument 
of beauty and harmony when it vibrates in time with artistic imagi- 
nation and collaborates with creative thought.” 
The centennial of Geneva, Switzerland, July, 1914, afforded.an 
opportunity for the world to see and judge of the place of euryth- 
mics in art. The first act of the Piéce Historique, of which Jacques-
-P-A-G-E-147
144 Francis W. Parker Scrroo. 
Dalcroze was the composer, depicted the soul of mankind during 
the various epochs of the history of Geneva up to the date of its 
' confederation with the Swiss Republic. Not ballet nor pantomime, 
but infinitely greater in its power than either of these, was the 
movement of these large groups of gray-clad figures, two hundred 
or more rhythmicians, on the vast stage of Greek design. Beginning 
with the gradual appearing on steps at either end of the stage of the 
Hours and Bells of the night, the action, accompanying the music 
of orchestra, chorus and soloists, portrayed the barbarity of the 
Helvetians, the Roman civilization, the Burgundian epoch, the 
Geneva of the franchise, the construction of the city, Geneva of the 
Duke of Savoy—might against right,—the revolt against oppression, 
the reform under Calvin and the new faith, L’Escalade—liberty 
resisting the last attacks of treachery,—a tribute to Jean Jacques 
Rousseau, and the Revolution. After this climax, the music grad- 
ually became calmer until, amid the ringing of chimes, the Hotirs 
and Bells of the night remounted the steps and disappeared. 
It is not the purpose of this article to enable readers to use the 
ideas of M. Jaques-Dalcroze in teaching eurythmics. “Rhythmic 
-Gymmnastics,” he says, “is above all a personal experience.” The 
most expert musicians have signally failed in teaching eurythmics 
until disciplined by the personal test of proving their understanding 
of rhythm in bodily movement; the most expert dancers have a still 
more difficult musical education to experience before arriving at the 
understanding of what eurythmics means. 
A normal course of at least two years, including all the branches 
of study—soifége, improvisation, rhythmic gymnastics and plastic— 
is absolutely essential to enable any one to teach the Dalcroze 
method of eurythmics. This year, for the first time, such a normal 
course may be studied in America at the New York School of Dal- 
croze Eurythmics. 
The writer aims in this article to state, honestly and plainly 
and without undue exaggeration of its favorable features, the 
results of three years’ teaching of eurythmics in the Francis W. 
Parker School. After these years of experience she feels justified 
in stating that in spite of personal mistakes and certain unfavorable 
conditions there have been interesting, desirable, and valuable 
results. : 
In the first grade the child’s natural instinct for expression in 
bodily activity is used to teach the habits of attention, self-control,
-P-A-G-E-148
Strupres in EpucaTion 145 
and judgment of space and distance in maintaining a circle of just 
proportion and equal distances. Note values, from whole notes to 
sixteenths, are first marched, then written on the board, so that the 
musical symbols which are sometimes so meaningless to children 
are felt and understood as movement and given their due value in 
singing or playing a musical instrument. Measures of two, three, 
four and five beats are recognized by the first grade children, who 
are able to beat the time as the music is played and to recognize 
instantly the changes of accent. 
It is in the presentation of these subjects that the teacher has 
had to learn the art of teaching; for the necessity of keeping the 
pupil’s interest, in a school.where each subject is exceptionally 
motivated and correlated, is a problem requiring a vast enthusiasm 
and ingenuity. Since the primary object of each exercise is to 
establish the feeling of rhythm through moving in perfect time to 
music, music must govern the action. Yet little children’s interest 
often needs the added stimulus of a dramatic or play idea, which, 
however, should not be so exciting as to make them forget to listen 
to the music. The following ideas, which have been the means to an 
end, are given in detail by way of illustration. 
The tree game is useful for giving control and balance. “To 
be trees in the forest one must have long roots, growing deep down 
into the earth,” and toes and heels wriggle as far as possible into 
the soft earth. “When the wind comes, it cannot blow us over, but 
we sway in time to it. The wind is our breath. When we breathe 
in, we sway backward from our ankles to our heels, as straight as 
a tree; when we breathe out, we sway forward, keeping always the 
same upright position. If we are pointed fir trees, we point our - 
two hands together, stretching them up as high as they can go and 
watching the points sway back and forth against the sky. If we 
are weeping willow trees, we droop down until our hands almost 
reach the ground, and let them swing from side to side. If we are 
graceful palm trees, we lift our branches and let them bend to one 
side, then the other side, and backward and forward.” The simple 
and melodious piece of music called Litile Study, from Schu- 
mann’s Scenes from Childhood, makes a suitable accompaniment for 
this exercise. : 
Measure is formed by a regular recurrence of accent, which has 
to do with weight or dynamics, while it is an element of rest or 
interruption of the regular succession of sounds which makes rhythm.
-P-A-G-E-149
146 Francis W. ParKER SCHOOL 
Accent is first illustrated in this way. Marching in a circle, the 
children represent a wheel which moves smoothly and slowly until 
“the tire explodes. This explosion the children express by a loud 
stamp and with clenched fists shooting up into the air—a general 
outburst of energy which is thoroughly enjoyed. Afterward, when 
the tire is mended, it causes a bump (a stamp) every four counts, 
every two counts, and every three counts, which represents duple, 
triple, and quadruple measures. Expression of accent is important 
for the understanding of measure, as accents connect and group 
pulses, forming measure or meter in poetry. Expressing meter or 
measure by movement awakens and enriches the poetic impulse and 
explains the great apparent satisfaction with which the children 
chant the following jingle to accompany the movements of “beating 
four”: 
One goes down with a bump! 
And two makes a cradle. 
Three goes out as wide as the world, 
And four as high as I am able. 
In the second grade the children learn to combine all note values 
and movements for beating different kinds of measure. They have 
a far greater degree of inhibitory control than in the first grade and 
are capable of giving interesting demonstrations of their work. Cer- 
tain musical forms and rhythms were chosen in correlation with their 
study of shepherd life and the desert, including stories of the Bible. 
Some of these rhythmic stories were combined to be given for the 
entertainment of the seniors at their senior party. A prologue was 
composed by one of the second grade members telling of the 
approaching departure into Mesopotamia of Abraham’s servant with 
a train of camels, to find a wife for Abraham’s son Isaac. He 
tells of his doubts and fears in undertaking his important search for 
the right maiden and how he plans to find her. At the end of the 
prologue the servant disappears, and is seen, when the music begins, 
at the head of the train of camels, starting on his long journey 
across the desert. The journey ends at the well outside the city 
‘gates, where the camels kneel to drink and maidens come to fill 
their water jars at the well. The old servant’s ruse is successful: 
Rebecca is given the presents sent by Abraham, and the procession 
moves on again, taking with them the wished-for bride of Isaac. 
The music was Arabian in character and induced the right feeling

and rhythm for the soft-footed, slow-moving camels, who were all 
the little boys of the second grade. The maidens, carrying water 
jars on their heads, were represented by all the little girls. The 
children’s spontaneous expression of joyous, rhythmic movement 
made the performance true art, indescribabiy eloquent and religious 
in feeling. The music for shepherds was a pastorale of Scarlatti, 
which the children love and which certainly helped to arouse the 
charming expression which they gave in the original songs they com- 
posed to express the shepherd’s joy in finding water in the desert. 
The regular fourth grade work is a study of Greek life, and 
eurythmics has here a logical and necessary place and gives the true 
Greek feeling as no other subject in the curriculum does. The study 
of rhythm continues .in exercises of free and controlled movement, 
unusual measures of five and seven beats, ball games, discus throw- 
ing, spear throwing to music, as well as polyrhythmic studies like 
“The Horses,” in which horses and drivers march in different note 
values, the horses always twice as fast as the drivers. 
The first fourth grade which studied eurythmics worked out a 
Greek festival to the goddess Demeter, which was given as a pre- 
lude to the play of Pandora. The festival began with a dance of 
flower girls, then came a procession bearing fruits and flowers, . 
lyres, flutes and cymbals; after which charioteers exhibited their 
skill with horses. The crowning of the most expert charioteer with 
laurel made the climax of the festival, and the procession moved 
off. The most important result of this experience, aside from the 
musical and physical development and aesthetic joy, was seen in a 
remarkable increase in the technique of painting and drawing. The 
opportunity of making a picture of the procession was eagerly 
seized upon several times before the children were satisfied with 
their achievement. The results were paintings and drawings which 
by their unusual animation and excellence have aroused interest 
wherever shown. 
This tendency of eurythmics to enhance art expression in 
drawing and painting has been so noticeable in all the grades that 
further experimentation has been planned by the art teachers to 
prove that this kind of rhythmic experience should be a fundamental 
part of art education. 
Eurythmics is given to the girls in the freshman year of high 
school. The first group continued their work a second year and 
demonstrated the results which are claimed for it—quick response

    PAINTINGS BY FOURTH-GRADE CHILDREN ILLUSTRATING THE “HORSES” 
to rhythm, control, balance, poise, beauty, and grace of movement. 
A plastic study of a Crescendo, a composition of Schumann, and of 
a Bach invention were interpreted in movement in a morning exer- 
cise, 4 
Eighth grade boys gave a ten minute demonstration of euryth- 
mics at the National Convention of Physical Educators in 1919, 
which excited much favorable comment. Their program consisted 
of exercises for developing spontaneity of will, co-ordination, con- 
centration, initiative, and mental and physical control. These exer- 
cises were executed to music improvised by the teacher. In one 
exercise the movements of the group were directed by one pupil 
with a baton. In the last two numbers the music and movements 
were memorized, one being a rhythmic study showing muscle ten- 
sion and relaxation, the other leaping and jumping in time to music. 
Thus the program was designed to show, first, that Daleroze Euryth- 
mics aims to develop the individual toward his fullest capacity for 
living, and second, that, as the Greeks also believed, music is the 
indispensable medium for such education. 
This fourth year in the Francis W. Parker School shows results
-P-A-G-E-153
150 Francis W. Parker SCHOOL 
more clearly than any previous year. Eurythmics is seen to be an 
education which trains ear, mind, and body, by means of the uni- 
versal instinct for expression through bodily activity.. President 
Eliot of Harvard writes of it: “The Dalcroze Method is a strong 
case of teaching through action on the part of the pupil.” It illus- 
trates Colonel Parker’s saying that “all education comes through 
self-effort.” To quote again from Colonel Parker, “Music cultivates 
the emotions which determine the motive and control the will. 
Rhythm, the basis of all melody and harmony, is a powerful means 
for the adjustments of the body in graceful, subtle movements, thus 
rendering it a more and more perfect instrument of the soul.” A 
sentence written by Jaques-Dalcroze in his latest book, La Plas- 
tique Animée, completes and fulfills the requirements of Colonel 
Parker. “It is our intention to establish by the study of ‘rhythmic’ 
an intimate alliance between the physical and artistic faculties and 
to make music in its infinite variety of nuance, dynamic and rhythmic, 
serve to educate that musical instrument par excellence, the human 
body.” 
In reviewing the progress of Dalcroze Eurythmics in America, 
it is well to remember that until Jaques-Dalcroze personally con- 
ducts performances of his work little can be known of the beauty 
and wonder of his demonstrations in Europe. Europe, up to this 
time, has been the only place where this education could be obtained, 
and Jaques-Dalcroze is the inspired originator whom no one as yet 
can equal. What has been done up to this time is little more than 
a paving of the way for the genuine recognition which is due to 
this great educator. It is to be hoped that such recognition will be 
manifested in the establishment of institutions in this country like 
those already existing in Geneva, London, and Paris, where courses 
in eurythmics are given to parents, teachers, musicians, dilettanti, 
professional artists, writers, doctors, and actors, as well as to chil- 
dren and normal students. Such institutions should afford the 
opportunity of studying the Dalcroze Method as a whole, including 
solfége and improvisation, both as yet unknown to this country. 
The willingness and readiness of Americans to welcome any good 
thing in education and music make it certain that M. Jaques-Dal- 
croze will find an appreciative and sympathetic reception for his 
ideas.

SPECIAL VALUES IN PARKER SCHOOL EXPERIENCE: 
ALUMNI IMPRESSIONS. 
Nore: We hesitate to print these two articles from two school alumni, 
one of whom was graduated in 1910, the other in 1917. A few months 
ago we asked each graduate for a letter answering the following ques- 
tions: 
1. Do you consider that anything in your experience at Parker 
. was especially conducive to:training in good citizenship? 
2. If so, what, in particular, has proven useful to you as a member 
of a larger community? 
Many of the letters received in reply mentioned features of school 
life which illustrate the subject of this volume. We have chosen two 
for printing here. While almost all of the replies emphasized the points 
brought out in those two letters, their authors were not all so optimistic. 
Several told of difficulties they had encountered because of the failure 
to realize during their school experience the need of absolute accuracy 
in all their work. Others said that in our freedom there was not enough 
strong guidance. They have made us realize many of our inadequacies; 
they have made us take stock of our practice in relation to our theory. 
Moreover, we are of course aware of the fact that much of the rare 
quality in certain young people who have gone through our school is 
inherent, and not the product of organized education. 
In printing these two letters, therefore, we protest that we are not 
saying, “See what we have done!” We are simply giving the impression 
of two sincere critics of the school who know it well because they have 
spent many years in it. The vividness of certain experiences has stayed 
with them. Certain habits of thought have grown up in them. Their 
statements may give to the reader a new viewpoint upon some of the 
work which we have tried to make clear in this book, and which is 
after all better experienced than talked about. 
SeLr-CoMMAND 
Training in self-command, in my opinion, is what the Parker 
School most richly contributes to its pupils and to their power of 
being good citizens, I do not mean merely self-control, for that is 
essentially negative: I mean self-command in doing, even more 
than in not doing. Stch self-command includes the power to see 
what ought to be done, to devise the means of doing, and to have 
the force, courage, and persistence to do and to continue to do until 
the end is accomplished. Such self-command is not only a moral 
quality, it is also intellectual. 
151
-P-A-G-E-155
152 Francis W. Parker. SCHOOL 
Training that develops self-command is so subtle that it is 
difficult to explain the means by which the Parker School accom- 
plished it. We were taught to see the value of our study and to 
make ourselves study without being compelled. In every matter of 
discipline we were not made to do or not to do; we were brought 
to see the wisdom or the rightness of doing or not doing and to 
command ourselves to do or not to do. Thus we were helped to 
want whatever was right, to think out for ourselves what the right 
was, and to be able to bring ourselves to live up to our own thinking. 
We were not even told explicitly what to do or how to do it, in our 
work of in our play. In a history course, I rememer being allowed 
to choose the subject of most interest to me to write a long theme 
upon, and having chosen “The Nautical Instruments of Columbus,” 
I asked where to read about them and how to get the material 
together. I was given the teacher’s library card and told that I 
could probably find what I wanted at the Public Library. The rest 
I was left to work out for myself. We were not given short lessons 
from a textbook which we could almost memorize, but we were 
given the opportunity of discriminating between the important and 
the unimportant material. In physics we performed experiments 
before reading in the textbook the principles to be illustrated. In 
manual training we were not given a set series of plant labels, blotter 
pads, broad swords, etc., to make, but we were left to design our own” 
manufactures. Even when we undertook to build boats and auto-- 
mobiles the teacher did not discourage us, though he admitted at 
the start that he knew little about them and knew of no place in 
which to build them. Though possibly we did not learn as many 
facts as pupils in other schools, or pass such high examinations, we 
did learn how to find out facts, how to discover and use opportuni- 
ties, how to act on our own responsibility. 
In college, when given subjects for theses with the library 
before us and no other assistance to be had, when conducting experi- 
ments in special fields where the way was not mapped out; in law 
school, where cases and not textbooks are given, and where examina- ~ 
tion questions do not relate to settled rules or principles; in business 
or professions, where nearly every contingency that arises brings 
problems that have never been fully solved before; in all these, 
it is not so much accumulated knowledge that counts, as the ability 
to know how to work things out from the sources on the known 
principles, or somehow to feel them out from the facts themselves.
-P-A-G-E-156

If one can thus work things out and has learned to like to do so, 
his education in schools is just a beginning for the education of life. 
Each new experience will add to his sum of knowledge, and in the 
end his accumulated knowledge will be larger than that of people 
who learned more facts at school but did not learn so fully either 
how to learn or the joy of learning. More than mere ability, the 
methods of the Parker School give the power and the habit of 
choosing for oneself to do the right, of determining what that right 
is. This alone makes ability and the possession of knowledge of 
true vaiue to the individual and to the community in which he lives. 
Power To THINK AND to AcT 
It is the innumerable things I was allowed to work out for 
myself at Parker that have remained most vivid in my mind. For 
example: when I saw the mouth of the Mississippi River for the 
first time, I knew in what stage the delta was, what was happening 
to it, and what probably would happen to it, not because I had read 
about it in a book, but because I remembered just what happened to 
the delta I had built in the sand table in the fifth grade, and had 
watched and experimented with under. all sorts of conditions. 
Since my days in fourth grade, I have had an admiration for 
ancient Greece and her culture that I am certain I never could have 
received from the printed page alone. For weeks in fourth grade 
we dressed like Greeks and acted like Greeks; we even thought like 
Greeks. Socrates was a very real man to me, and the details of 
the Trojan war I followed with anxiety. We listened to the adven- 
tures of Odysseus with feverish excitement. In our modeling 
classes we made, for the decoration of our room, friezes which we 
designed in our art classes. I knew and loved every corner of the 
* Parthenon. Going to the Art Institute and seeing statues of Athene 
and Hermes. was like meeting old, respected friends. 
My work in the clay room has not made a sculptress of me, 
but it has shown me the difficulties of the work and taught me to 
appreciate the work of others. Nor has my work in the art room 
made a great painter of me; yet this work, particularly our attempt 
at interpreting music by line and color, gave me an entirely new 
point of view about art. The hours spent in music have not given 
me a glorious voice, but they have taught me to love the best in 
music.

T shall always remember the senior class play as a wonderful 
experience. Before my senior year, a play I saw at the theater fell 
into one of two classes, a play I liked or a play I didn’t like; that 
was as far as I thought the thing out. However, after we had 
studied the history of the drama, seeing for ourselves how the num- 
ber of acts was gradually reduced, how the monologue fell into 
disuse, how the exposition became more subtle; in short, after we 
had learned to appreciate the technique of modern drama, I began 
to look, in the plays I saw, for things the existence of which I had 
never realized. Then, after we had given our own play, Cathleen ni 
Houlihan, the stage setting and action in every play meant some- 
thing to me, because we had tried to work out these problems our- 
selves, 
The secret of our all being so interested in what we were doing, 
I think, lay in the fact that what we were doing was usually so 
closely connected in some way with what was happening in the 
world. School was not a secluded little haven into which one with- 
drew for the purpose of becoming educated, but was a part of the 
living work. Our choice of plays, songs, art work, often had 
direct bearing upon some all-absorbing subject of interest in the 
world. 
In learning to understand our surroundings, however, we were 
never given predigested ideas about them. We were taught to 
observe what was around us and to form our own opinions. I feel 
that the power to think for myself is perhaps the most valuable 
thing I have gained out of my twelve years at Parker. I believe 
the best equipment in life is the power to think for one’s self. We 
were always encouraged at school to have our own ideas. In our 
geology work in the eighth grade, we took many field trips, made 
our own observations, formed our own conclusions and then wrote 
our own records. If, in mathematics, some one thought he had 
found a new method for solving a certain problem, and got the 
correct results, he was welcome to use his own method. We were 
given power to think rather than fixed ideas. 
Just to have your own ideas, without the power to act on them, 
is to be of little social value, but every child at Parker has had the 
school word, “Responsibility,” held up before him from his first day 
at school. The varied school activities, the printing of the Parker 
Weekly by the children, and the conspicuous absence of fixed rules,
-P-A-G-E-158

are proof of how well this great word is understood and appre- 
ciated. 
In short, I believe that the school teaches us how to understand 
the things about us; it trains in us the ability to form our own ideas 
about them, and the power to act upon those convictions; and in 
setting before us certain ideals which will guide us in our actions, 
it truly prepares us to be worthy citizens of the world.

BRIEF SUGGESTIONS FROM SCHOOL EXPERIENCES 
Fragmentary notes of certain activities and incomplete experi- 
ments in the school, which illustrate the principle of flexibility in 
schedule and curriculum, are given here in the hope that there may 
be something suggestive in them for other schools. Certainly, in 
every school there are unrealized opportunities for the widening of 
experience, 
_Tue Toy Suop anp tHE SCHEDULE 
There is value for children in working for a larger commun- 
ity than the grade or school community for which they usually work. 
This is the motive which prompted the establishment of the Santa 
Claus Toy Shop,* in which, each December, hundreds of old toys are 
repaired, to be sent to children who otherwise would lack Christmas 
gifts. This year the work was done as a school project, in school 
hours, instead of as an after-school piece of work performed by 
conscientious volunteers. The result was a great increase in output, 
including the making of hundreds of new toys. 
In order to accomplish this, the schedule of the entire school 
was changed. For two weeks preceding the Christmas recess, all 
gymnasium classes and handwork classes were given up. A special 
schedule was arranged, which for these two weeks brought all of 
the academic work into the morning hours. The afternoons were 
reserved for the rehearsal of Christmas music and for the Toy 
Shop. From noon on, the school was no school in the accepted 
sense: it was not a place where children were reciting and studying 
the approved subject-matter of an academic course of study. It wasa 
factory, producing four thousand toys in two weeks’ time. Every 
child above the second grade was a worker in the factory, having 
his hours of work recorded and receiving his pay at the end of the 
two weeks in the currency described in a former article on this 
subject.* No overtime work was done except by the high school 
and faculty foremen. 
The advantage of this plan for the Toy Shop was that every 
member of the school made a real contribution toward filling the

needs not only of the small school community, but also of other 
institutions, and of individuals who are victims of the present social 
order. The school authorities felt that the educative results of the 
. plan justified the task of rearranging programs. 
Tue Strupy of Current INTERESTS IN THE HicH ScHOOL 
The school believes that high school children need as vivid, 
accurate knowledge as is possible of the affairs and events of the 
world. For the last two years an experiment has been carried on in 
the high school for the purpose of enabling all the pupils to have one 
period a week for a more complete discussion of current events 
than can be made by casual reference in occasional classes. Six 
groups were organized to study current problems, and the pupils 
elected their groups according to their interests. There are groups 
in current events, in political and industrial science, in music, in 
art and in current literature. There has been some outcome of the 
work in morning exercises. Some high school boys, who met weekly 
_in a current events group, were interested and somewhat bewildered 
by the extravagant contradiction and accusations which were made 
in discussions of the Russian situation. With the help of the faculty 
leader, these boys examined much of the literature that had been 
issued by friends and enemies of the Soviet government. In a 
morning exercise, they presented the result of their work to the 
school, giving, without partisanship, an outline of the Russian form 
of government, and the arguments advanced for and against it. 
The result to the school was of course not measurable, but surely 
it is healthy for the children to hear from their comrades clear, 
fair, illuminating discussion of a topic usually befogged by preju- 
dice and misunderstanding. The art group has planned an exercise 
to illustrate the tendencies shown in the work of modern American 
artists. The music group is collecting material from a number of 
magazine articles on the subject of war-time music. They discussed 
community singing and other points of current interest in music, 
especially the perennial and ever-burning question, “what is good 
music?” The natural science group has made excursions into the 
park to study the flora of the neighborhood. .In the article on 
Adaptation in the Content of High School Science, in this volume, 
the work of the industrial science group is discussed. Many of 
the groups have not given morning exercises, but it is the object 
of this work, done in school time and included in every child’s pro-

gram, not only to contribute to the child’s knowledge, but to quicken 
and intensify his interest in the life of the world at this stirring 
and complex time.

How are we to know the needs and capacities of the child, if 
there is no means of recording them from year to year as he passes 
through the school? Dr. Adolph Meyer, of Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity, in an address which he gave in Chicago two years ago, 
urged that teachers work out a system of school records which 
“should give more and more a knowledge of the individual child, 
and home, and gang, and other factors in environment.” The need 
for such records has surely been felt by all teachers who, in planning 
their course of study, try to adapt it to the needs and capacities of 
the individual child. 
For two years a committee of the faculty of this school has 
been trying to design a set of record cards which will be economical _ 
of time and at the same time not too meager in information to be 
useful, and which will give the salient facts of each child’s environ- 
ment, special powers and weaknesses, interests, and activities. Uni- 
form with these cards are the physical records of the pupils and the 
records of their academic standing. When a child passes from one 
grade to the next, his cards go to the new teacher, who has con- 
sequently some knowledge upon which to begin the year’s work. 
A tentative set of cards was drawn up and copies were sent to 
Dr. G. Stanley Hall, of Clark University; Dr. Adolph Meyer, of 
Johns Hopkins University; Dr. Frank M. McMurry, of Teachers’ 
College, Columbia University; Dr. William Healy, of the Judge 
Baker Foundation of Boston, and Mrs. Helen T. Woolley, of the 
Vocational Bureau of the Cincinnati Public Schools. The criticisms 
and suggestions of these people were of great help to the committee 
in revising the cards for trial in the school. 
Since the cards are being used for the first time this year, and 
will probably need some changes before the system can become per- 
manent, it is impossible at this time to make any real report con- 
cerning them. Mention is made of them here, because they repre- 
sent an effort at helping teachers to know the children more inti- 
mately and to adapt the curriculum to their individual needs.

PUBLICATIONS OF THE FRANCIS W. PARKER 
SCHOOL 
Studies in Education* 
Volume I. The Social Motive in School Work. 
This volume describes school activities which are controlled by strong 
social motives, The contents include articles on: The Spirit of Giving as 
Developed at Thanksgiving and Christmas; The Setting and Costuming 
of a Play; Music in the School Community; Original Composition in 
Music; The School Print Shop; Printing in the Seventh Grade; Care 
of Chickens; Eighth Grade Community Work. 
Volume II. The Morning Exercise as a Socializing Influence. 
In Volume II, the use of the social motive is further illustrated by 
articles describing exercises given in the daily school assemblies. They 
show how classroom work in science, mathematics, geography, literature, 
art, etc., has been utilized. Some exercises are reported verbatim, while 
in others the method of preparation is described. A classified list of 
typical morning exercises is given. 
Volume III, Expression as a Means of Training Motive. 
This volume deals with the place of expression in education. It 
contains an article on the theory of expression, and other articles 
as follows: Play as Fundamental in Education; Oral Reading; The 
Value, Place, and Use of the Dramatic Instinct in the Education of 
Young People; Imaginative Writing; Clay Modeling; Metal Working; 
Making a Rug; The Social Application of Painting and Drawing. 
Volume IV. Education Through Concrete Expression. 
The articles in this volume show how the school provides opportunity 
for the pupils to gain adequate mental imagery as a basis of study, 
through individual activity and observation, and through personal contact 
with actual materials. They also show how, through constructive activ- 
ities and projects connected with the school life of the pupil, the applica- 
tion of knowledge gained is demanded. The work of many grades and 
departments is represented, accompanied by many illustrations. 
Volume V. The Course in Science. 
This volume presents the science of both the elementary and high 
school. Following a statement of the general principles controlling the 
selection of material and its organization, the work of each grade and 
high school course is presented separately and completely. Subject matter 
is fully outlined, including much experimental work, methods of presenta- 
tion are indicated, and the outcome is made clear by representative pieces 
of children’s work. An attempt is made throughout the volume to show 
how the work in science may be based entirely upon the interests, activ- 
ities, and problems of the pupil. Lists of reference books are included 
and there are numerous illustrations. 
*The first five volumes were published as Year Books.

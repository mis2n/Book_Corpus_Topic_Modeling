PREFACE 
HE preface of a book is usually an apology 
for its existence. This one is no exception 
to the rule. The large number of already avail- 
able text-books in Psychology makes pertinent 
the question: Why another? In attempting to 
justify the appearance of this one, I would first 
call attention to the need of a growing science, such 
as Psychology, for constant revision, and the en- 
visagement of its problems from various angles. 
This has doubtless been the occasion for many of 
the texts which we already have. 
The chief motives for the writing of the present 
book were two. The first of these was to supply a 
general elementary text-book which would meet the 
demands of the average student beginner a little 
more adequately than has been done hitherto. 
After ten years’ experience in teaching a first 
course in Psychology, I have become convinced 
that the mode of attack usually followed fails to 
supply the student with the sort of introduction 
into the science of mind that will enable him, on 
the one hand, to connect his Psychology with every- 
day life, and, on the other hand, to apprehend the 
bearings of this science upon Philosophy, Education, 
Sociology and Biology.
-P-A-G-E-9
viii PREFACE 
It has been my experience that so much time was 
consumed in the study of the nervous system, and 
of the experimental data of sensation and percep- 
tion, that in a brief course no adequate considera- 
tion could be given to mind as a whole, and to the 
important topics of personality and character. 
To introduce a student to the study of Psychology 
is one thing, and no doubt the detailed study of 
psychophysiological data, with their appropriate 
laboratory exercises, is a most satisfactory means 
to this end. But the function of Psychology in 
an undergraduate college course is another thing, 
and is not purely departmental. The average 
student does not go beyond the first brief course. 
He does, however, frequently elect further work 
in Philosophy and Education, Sociology and Biol- 
ogy. In coming to these subjects he should bring 
with him psychological conceptions of a general 
sort that will be useful to him. : 
It is the consciousness of this need which has 
supplied the first motive for this book. How well 
I may have succeeded, it is beyond me to say. 
Many defects will doubtless be apparent to the 
critical reader. I can only hope that they may 
not prove serious enough to invalidate the purpose 
which I have had in view. 
The question was continually pressing in the 
treatment of each topic: How much and how little 
should be said?. In my endeavor to keep the book 
within such limits as would make it practicable to 
cover the ground completely in a one-term course,
-P-A-G-E-10
PREFACE ix 
the result may appear, perhaps, as too condensed 
and schematic. If this be the case, I can never- 
theless invoke the willing codperation of the 
instructor in providing for his discussions the neces- 
sary addenda in the way of illustrative material 
which he may deem important. 
I have purposely avoided all diagrams, refer- 
ences to literature and practical demonstrations. 
But these also will be readily supplied by the 
instructor, if the need be felt. 
The second motive for this book was my convic- 
tion that the time has come when we must modify 
some of our psychological principles and concep- 
tions, with reference to the more recent inves- - 
tigations of the thought-processes. This has 
offered a difficult problem, and one which it 
would be impertinent to regard as adequately 
solved. It might well be contended that our 
present knowledge is all too incomplete to justify 
the incorporation of such data in a general text- 
book. Were it not that they have such import- 
ant bearings upon psychological interpretation, I 
should agree in this. But for one who is con- 
vinced that new principles of interpretation are 
now demanded, it is no longer possible to teach 
the old Psychology, in which sensation and asso- 
ciation are the chief foundations. 
Believing that purposive direction and imageless 
contents are facts which must be increasingly dealt’ 
with in modern Psychology, I have not hesitated 
to incorporate them into this book, and to use
-P-A-G-E-11
x PREFACE 
them as suggestions for a systematic point of 
view. I have tried, however, to avoid the dog- 
matic tone, and to present the facts as impartially 
as I could. 
In this connection I wish also to say that my 
convictions rest chiefly upon my own investiga- 
tions. While I owe much to the works of Binet 
and Woodworth, and above all to my colleagues 
of the “Wiirzburg School,” I question if I should 
have reached the firm conviction which I hold, 
were it not for the investigations carried on in my 
own laboratory. I mention this fact, not only to 
defend myself from the possible charge that a sense 
of ‘collegiate piety is the true occasion for this 
attempt to establish the results of my erstwhile 
colleagues and friends at Wiirzburg, but also to 
protect them from being involved in the mistaken 
assumption that this book is in any sense an 
authoritative presentation of their views. | 
Iam indebted to so many sources for the material 
of my work, that it would be difficult, without an 
extended catalogue, to refer to them all. In the 
first instance, my debt to Professor Oswald Kiilpe 
is very great. Not only have I received my chief 
inspiration from him, but he has also assisted me 
by going over the complete outline of the book 
after its first draft was written. His valuable 
suggestions and criticisms have resulted in many 
alterations and the inclusion of considerable addi- 
tional matter. For the lively interest which he 
has taken in the work, and the opportunity which
-P-A-G-E-12
PREFACE xi 
he has afforded me for detailed discussion of all 
the important issues involved, I am _ sincerely 
grateful. 
I wish also to acknowledge my obligations to 
the teacher under whose guidance I received my 
first introduction to the study of Psychology. I 
refer to Professor E. B. Titchener. Although the 
standpoint from which I write is not the one ac- 
cepted by him, I am always gratefully mindful of 
the opportunity for broad and thorough orienta- 
tion in psychological methodology afforded me at 
Cornell University. If any merit attaches to 
the systematic form of my work, I feel that it 
is directly attributable to the influence of Pro- 
fessor Titchener. Furthermore, I have profited 
largely by his writings and by the personal discus- 
sions which he has been good enough to undertake 
with me. 
Among literary sources, I could mention many, 
but the character of this work does not seem 
to warrant bibliographical references. For the 
trained psychologist these will be obvious enough. 
For others it is not, perhaps, a matter of importance. 
I cannot, however, refrain from mentioning my ob- 
ligations to the writings of William McDougall, 
and especially to his volume on Body and Mind, 
which I have found most stimulating. 
To three other friends a word of special and 
sincere thanks is due: — First, to Dr. Shepherd 
Ivory Franz, who has revised my chapter on 
Insanity; second, to Dr. Henry J. Watt, who was
-P-A-G-E-13
xii PREFACE 
kind enough to read the first draft of the MS., 
and to offer many valuable suggestions for its 
betterment; and last, to my colleague, Professor 
George Herbert Clarke, who by his critical reading 
of the completed text has managed to inject into 
it whatever grace of diction and style has been 
possible.

THE PROBLEM OF 
PSYCHOLOGY
-P-A-G-E-21

-P-A-G-E-22
CHAPTER I 
THE OBJECT OF PSYCHOLOGY 
1. Psychology as a Science 
\HE object of psychology is the study of 
mental happenings. Like the natural sci- 
ences, psychology finds its subject-matter in a 
certain domain of facts. These facts, are either 
themselves conscious experiences or are concerned 
with them. The primary interest of psychology 
consists in as complete a description and analysis 
of experience as may be possible. But there are 
also other interests involved, without which psy- 
chology could hardly attain scientific standing. 
Just as the science of life, or biology, must study 
the physical nature of the living organism, so must 
psychology correlate mental events with the phys- 
ical conditions of the body which experiences them, 
and with the environment which provokes them. 
This treatment of mental happenings in relation 
to their physical conditions is termed psychophysics. 
The study of mental happenings implies still 
more than this. Our science is not yet complete 
when we have analyzed and described all our mental 
events, and have correlated them with the physical 
conditions provided by the body and _ its environ- 
ment. A pure psychophysics of this sort would 
place all experience within a system of physical 
events. The continuity of consciousness would
-P-A-G-E-23
4 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
then appear to be completely dependent upon 
these physical events, psychology would cease 
to be considered an independent science, and 
the only object in studying experience would be 
to set problems for the physicist, the chemist, 
and the physiologist. 
There aré scientists who accept this view and 
who regard psychology merely as a dependent and 
subordinate province of biology. Some of them 
contend that psychological facts are without causal 
efficiency. They believe that the only scientific 
problem which is worthy of consideration in this 
domain is the problem of behavior:— what the 
organism does, and why. There is even a tendency 
to dispute the scientific status of consciousness. 
Now, we cannot deny that the problem of organic 
behavior is a scientific problem of great importance, 
and one which has direct bearings upon psychology. 
For instance, the content of an animal’s conscious- 
ness cannot be directly communicated to us. We 
must therefore study its movements if we wish 
to determine its capacities. But it does not follow 
that we shall be able to understand these capacities 
without assuming the presence of mentality in the 
animal. And even though there be indications 
that certain forms of behavior are completely 
explicable in terms of the animal’s physical na- 
ture, it does not follow that man’s consciousness 
is a useless and gratuitous adjunct, without which 
he would be able to act quite as naturally as he 
now does.
-P-A-G-E-24
THE OBJECT OF PSYCHOLOGY 5 
In any event, the science of behavior in this 
narrower sense is not psychology, and our primary 
\, interests here are in mental contents and™ “opera- 
{ tions, We therefore describe our science as one 
 g that, ‘deals with mental happenings, — not merely 
: ee contents, but with operations and processes 
: "Sha the complicated pattern of which mental ele- 
AF ments may be isolated with more or less definite- 
'-< ness and precision. 
      2. Its Chief Lines of Investigation 
From this point of view it will appear that our 
study includes three main lines of investigation, 
which we may summarize as follows: 
1. The description and analysis of conscious 
contents. 
2. The correlation of the physiological processes 
which accompany or interact with consciousness, 
and likewise of the physical events within and with- 
out the body which operate as exciting causes ‘upon 
these physiological processes. 
3. The discovery of the laws of mental activity 
which will explain mind as a whole, by establish- 
ing the relations of mental events to one another 
and to their physical and physiological corre- 
lates. / 
In what follows we shall not find it desirable to 
hold these different lines of investigation rigidly 
distinct. On the contrary, it will be more helpful 
to us to treat them in their natural setting of close 
interrelationship. It may be well, therefore, be-
-P-A-G-E-25
6 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
fore proceeding further, to enlarge a little upon 
our brief summary. 
Every science has for its object the study of a 
group of facts, together with the conditions of 
their occurrence and the relationships existing 
among them. It is this principle of ‘scientific 
procedure which we have endeavored to express 
in the distinctions drawn above between psycho- 
logical content, psychophysical correlation and the 
laws of mental activity. We might state the 
matter in another way by using the terms structural, 
psychophysical and functional to express these 
three phases of psychological study. The study 
of the mind’s structure would aim at discovering 
the elements to which all consciousness may be 
reduced. The study of psychophysics would en- 
deavor to correlate these elements with the physical 
factors within and without the body which serve 
as stimuli for processes in the nervous system. It 
would also inquire into the nature of such nervous 
processes and their bearings upon consciousness. 
The importance of this phase of inquiry is evident 
when we consider how close the relation of con- 
sciousness is to nervous activity. It is well 
known that defects of the nervous mechanism 
of the body, occasioned by disease, or injury, or by 
the more or less temporary influence of certain 
drugs, are frequently attended by mental derange- 
ment. The loss of sensibility, the incapacity to 
react normally and the various mental aberrations 
which produce insanity are all attributable in large
-P-A-G-E-26
THE OBJECT OF PSYCHOLOGY 7 
measure to such defects of the nervous system. 
Furthermore, there is the important fact of the 
conscious threshold, which requires a psychophys- 
ical interpretation. Briefly stated, this term in- 
dicates that a certain minimal intensity of nervous 
activity must be secured before consciousness is 
aroused, Lesser intensities, sufficient to excite 
the nerves, yet fail to provoke consciousness. Nor 
must the intensity of stimulus be too great. There 
is an upper as well as a lower threshold of con- 
sciousness, and neither can be absolutely fixed 
in any special case. A third point which indicates 
the importance of psychophysical investigation 
is revealed when we consider the large number of 
bodily activities, both inherited and acquired, 
occurring apparently without consciousness. Yet 
many of these may become conscious, and others 
have important bearings upon consciousness at a 
later time. 
These three considerations, (1) the dependence 
of consciousness upon a normal nervous activity, 
(2) the thresholds of sensibility, and (3) the facts 
of unconscious, reflex or automatic, behavior, 
are sufficient to indicate that a complete explana- 
tion of mind is impossible without some reference 
to the physical and physiological correlates which 
constitute nervous activity. Indeed, so important 
and so far-reaching are the results of this inter- 
action of bodily activities and mental happenings, 
that many psychologists have believed it possible 
to give a complete and satisfactory account of
-P-A-G-E-27
8 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
mind by the analysis and description of conscious 
structure, when aided by psychophysical correla- 
tions. This, however, is not the point of view 
adopted in this book. We shall, therefore, treat 
mental activity as a third phase of our study, 
and shall endeavor to show that mind involves 
processes which are not merely mechanical in the 
sense that the physical and chemical processes 
of the nervous system presuppose, but which 
are in a real sense purposive in their determin- 
ations. 
We have alluded to this third phase of our study 
as functional, but to avoid ambiguity we shall 
not employ the term further in this connection, 
because “functional psychology”, as ordinarily 
understood by English and American writers, does 
not necessarily admit such purposive determina~ 
tions, but often refers merely to the ‘functions ”’ 
of psychophysical interrelationships. In order to 
distinguish clearly between psychophysical pro- 
cesses and the processes which obtain between men- 
tal factors we shall refer to the latter as mental acts 
or activities. Let us also emphasize at this point 
our previous references to physical stimulation and 
the nervous processes as correlates of consciousness. 
This permits us to maintain that the condi- 
tions which explain the appearance of conscious- 
hess are not entirely physical and physiological, 
but are also in part, at least, mental. The con- 
sciousness with which we have to deal appears in 
a physical setting, and is in a large measure con-

trolled and determined by this physical setting; 
but not entirely so, because the laws of physics 
do not permit an adequate explanation of that 
unique feature of mental happenings, —a feature 
which has its analogue in all manifestations of 
life,— namely, its purposive aspect.

CHAPTER II 
THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
3. What is Consciousness? 
HEN we ask ourselves the question: What 
is consciousness? we are plunged at once 
into the very centre of the problem which psy- 
chology has to solve. It is clear, therefore, that 
this question cannot be adequately answered in 
the opening paragraphs of our volume, because 
its answer forms material for the entire book. 
Nevertheless, in approaching any domain of science 
one must seek a path, and the suggestions for our 
guidance must come from the knowledge we 
already possess. Consequently, we are forced to 
give some provisional answer to the question: 
What is consciousness? if only for the purpose of 
indicating which way we have to proceed in order 
to reach the psychological domain. 
The most obvious answer is that consciousness ., 
is experience, and that experience constitutes the 
“things of thé world when these things are regarded 
ina certain way. Let us take as a concrete é&Xample 
the desk at which these words are being written. 
This desk, as a concrete object in the world of things, 
is made of oak-wood. It has certain dimensions 
and weight. It suggests the ingenuity of the 
designer and the art of the carpenter; it has a 
-certain commercial value, and a certain utility.
-P-A-G-E-30
THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS 11 
These, among other facts, belong to the desk as an 
object in the world of things. 
As facts of experience all these things are viewed 
differently. The oak-wood is primarily something 
to be seen and touched. That is, it appeals to 
one through the senses. Its dimensions and weight 
may also be estimated in sensory terms, when one 
is able to refer these sensations to previous expe- 
riences of analogous nature. It is memory that 
makes this possible. The wood is called oak 
because it resembles wood previously seen and 
touched to which that term has been applied. 
Such experiences may be recalled, and memory 
_dmages from the past substantiate the judgment of 
the present. Thus the experience of texture, size 
and weight is not merely sensory, but i is also in 
part imaginal. 
But knowledge of the desk as an object of the 
world of things is not complete in the sensations 
and images which it provokes. There may also 
be affections involved,— pleasure or displeasure. 
These have no direct relation to the object as a 
thing. They belong entirely to the mental atti- 
.tude of the experiencing subject. He is pleased 
or displeased, or neither, for reasons which must 
be sought in his peculiar mental make-up. 
Furthermore, the judgments of which we have 
spoken, the estimate as to the nature of the wood, 
size and weight, together with the further facts 
concerning design and construction, commercial 
and utilitarian value,— these are all objects of
-P-A-G-E-31
12 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
thought, and, as we shall see, have their origin in a 
distinct set of mental activities and products. 
Sensation, image, affection, thought, these sum- 
marize the experiential or psychological content 
of an object, which in the world of things may 
serve as basis for mechanical, commercial or 
economic consideration. 
4. Its Transitive Character, and the Need for 
: Analysis 
Another important fact concerning the gen~ 
eral nature of consciousness is its transitive 
character. Consciousness fows on in a temporal 
““gequence of events which are more or less separable 
and distinct. As we observe it, the flow is not 
entirely continuous, for at least the regularly re- 
curring periods of sleep seem to interrupt its con- 
tinuity. It is this fact which makes it difficult 
to explain mind as a mere causal sequence of con- 
scious events. Even if we agree that conscious 
elements are but abstractions, and the real contents 
of consciousness are always processes, as some psy- 
chologists describe them, we are forced to seek for 
other processes, of which we are not fully conscious, 
in order to bridge such gaps as we find, for 
instance, in sleep. We have good logical grounds, 
therefore, for defending our right to analyze the 
conscious flow, in an endeavor to understand both 
its structure and its activities. 
It is a fundamental principle of logic, that all 
explanation rests on a relating of terms, and it is
-P-A-G-E-32
THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS 13 
only by analyzing consciousness that we shall be 
able to arrive at terms which can be so related. . 
A further corollary of the logical method of in- 
quiry insists that the terms shall be as simple as 
possible. Our aim, therefore, must be to carry our 
analysis back to terms which are not further re- 
ducible. Now, it is not contended that in this 
ideal aim we shall be entirely successful. The 
science of chemistry rests largely upon the applica- 
tion of this method, yet recent research concerning 
radio-activity and kindred phenomena has revealed 
the fact that the chemical elements are not ulti- 
mate, as they were once supposed to be, and one 
speaks now of ‘electrons’ and ‘corpuscles’ as the 
most fundamental constituents of matter. Simi- 
larly in psychology, it is at present impossible 
to state that the elements our analysis may 
adduce are in any absolute sense the ultimate 
terms with which our science must for all time be 
content. This, however, does not make our pro- 
visional conclusions less important, any more than 
the recent results of chemistry have deprived the 
chemical atom of its scientific value. 
5. The Unity of Consciousness 
A general consideration of the nature’ of con- 
sciousness reveals other facts, which will serve to 
guide our later explanations. In the first place, 
consciousness is always unitary. The separable 
contents which constitute a moment or a series of 
events are always related to one another in a unique
-P-A-G-E-33
14 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
manner. Usually, this means a common reference 
of all these elements to the experiencing subject. 
I have the sensations, images, affections and 
thoughts constituting my experience. The in- 
timate relationships which bind these together 
into a unitary whole are not merely relations from 
part to part, but also involve a personal reference. 
This is known as the subject-object relation. The 
fence which I see before me, or the idea of the tariff 
legislation which I entertain are not simply objects 
of experience, but they are also objects of my 
experience. 
It is a matter of dispute whether or not a true 
self-consciousness is always involved in every 
experience. Those who maintain that it is seek 
here the foundation for conscious unity. But 
others deny that we are always conscious of self. 
In many of our everyday experiences we appear 
to be entirely immersed in the objects which we 
perceive and the things which we are doing. Fur- 
thermore, in some extraordinary cases, the con- 
sciousness of self is markedly altered. In certain 
nervous diseases, the patients complain that they 
are no longer themselves, and dreams of normal in- 
dividuals have been reported in which the expe~ 
riences seemed to belong to another. It has not 
been clearly shown, however, that consciousness 
can ever be completely detached from some degree 
of subjective reference. The question, therefore, 
is still open. 
Without forcing the issue as to the invariable
-P-A-G-E-34
THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS 15 
presence of self-consciousness as the fundamental 
tie which binds experience into a unitary whole, 
we may at least note the fact that in addition to 
the objects of experience there is always present 
some consciousness of mental activity in having 
the experience. This additional consciousness, 
which cannot be described in terms of sensation, 
image, affection or thought, is yet too little under- 
stood to be definitely assigned to its proper cate- 
gories. We must, therefore, be content to note the 
existence of conscious mental activities and leave 
to future investigation the task of defining the 
various modes in which objective experiences are 
arranged and ordered into unitary wholes. 
But let us be clear regarding our terms. What 
we have called the odjects of experience, and clas- 
sified provisionally under the four heads of (1) 
sensation, (2) image, (3) affection and (4) thought, 
are the contents of consciousness. By this we mean 
that every concrete experience is made up of ele- 
ments of these four sorts. When one studies any 
conscious state for the purpose of finding out what 
it contains, these are the things that come to 
view. Sometimes one finds all four classes repre- 
sented, while at other times some class or classes 
may beabsent. This analysis of conscious contents 
will be the subject of Part II of this book. 
In addition to the contents of consciousness, 
there are also aspects of mental happenings to be 
taken into consideration, which constitute the 
active side of mind. These mental activities are
-P-A-G-E-35
16 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
of two sorts: conscious and unconscious. The 
conscious snental activities are those which emanate 
from the subject or ego, the ‘personal reference’, 
as we callit; although, as already noted, we cannot 
be certain that self-consciousness is an invariable 
adjunct. Speaking more generally, we may say 
that these activities are summed up in our various 
attitudes of striving, seeking, willing, appreciating 
and the like, together with the opposite attitudes 
of passivity or dissent. The important point is 
that we are conscious of our attitudes as well as 
of the matters which we apprehend. As a recent 
writer has expressed it, we must “emphasize the 
distinction . . . between experience as experienced 
and experience as experiencing”. 
But there are also unconscious mental activities. 
This indicates at once that the term mental is not 
coextensive with conscious. Mentality involves 
not only that which is conscious, but also that 
which may be conscious in future. It is impossible 
to define the limits of consciousness with any 
degree of accuracy. We can be more or less con- 
scious of any given thing, and by imperceptible 
gradation that consciousness may pass below the 
threshold into the realm of the physiological. Some 
mental activities are, therefore, completely uncon~ 
scious. This use of the term unconscious is gen- 
erally accepted. Whether or not unconscious 
activities should be termed mental, depends 
upon the influence they exert upon future 
states of consciousness. Such physiological re-
-P-A-G-E-36
THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS 17 
flexes as are involved in the automatic processes 
of digestion, circulation and respiration may have 
no mental value whatever. On the other hand, 
a weak sensory impression, such as the sound of a 
distant bell, can pass unnoticed at the time it is 
heard, and yet the impression may be sufficiently 
lasting to provoke recurrence as a memory-image 
which is noted at a later time. 
There is another aspect of the unconscious which 
is more a subject of debate. It is maintained by 
some that mental activities of a complicated sort 
go on below the threshold of ordinary consciousness. 
We have, they say, not only a conscious mind, but 
also an unconscious mind, which is capable of 
retaining the impressions that come to us in the 
course of experience and also of doing mental work 
upon them, shaping them and ordering them against 
a future opportunity for their use. Thus, it has 
been maintained that the unconscious mind pos- 
sesses capacities which transcend those of the 
normal waking state, such as the ability to com- 
municate directly with other minds, both carnate 
and discarnate. Many more or less fanciful theories 
are based upon this supposition. Some regard 
the soul as hindered in its expression by the bodily 
mechanism. Hence the consciousness which we 
know is but an imperfect reflection of the real 
nature of the soul which guides our destiny. Below 
the threshold, however, it makes use of its wider- 
reaching capacities to build constantly a truer 
and more perfect personality. From time to time,
-P-A-G-E-37
18 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
as opportunity is afforded, this unconscious self 
is manifest by intuitions of truth and a progressive 
development of character. But the complete ex- 
pression is not attained until in bodily death the 
soul has thrown off its mortal garment. 
Somewhat less speculative is the conception 
that subconscious mental] activities are carried on 
within the boundary of consciousness, as differ- 
entiated from the purely physiological. Below 
* the threshold of complete consciousness, the con- 
scious entities continue to perform their charac- 
teristic tasks. Thus many features are injected 
into our waking states concerning the antecedents 
of which we have had no conscious knowledge. 
It is quite probable that this is in some degree true, 
although we are not at present in a position to 
study these questions to any considerable ex- 
tent. In sleep, for instance, it is possible that 
consciousness does not vanish; the contents, 
however, are no longer grouped and joined to- 
gether in the way in which we are alone able to 
hold them in unitary sequences. Consequently 
we lose them, not so much for lack of ability to 
note them as they come, but rather because we 
are unable to establish the necessary relations 
which enable us to remember them. 
Both conscious and unconscious mental con- 
tents and activities are set in a framework of psy- 
chophysical capacities and abilities. If we may be 
allowed to give a somewhat restricted meaning to 
these two terms, capacities are innate, and abilities
-P-A-G-E-38
THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS 19 
are. acquired. Taken together, these capacities 
and abilities constitute the foundation of an indi- 
vidual’s intelligence and behavior, and are some- 
times termed his dispositions, mental and physical. 
We are predisposed towards certain mental con- 
tents and certain conscious and unconscious (z.e. 
physical) activities. We also acquire in the course 
of experience modifications in disposition which 
make us peculiarly ready for certain acts and 
contents. These, taken together, constitute the 
faculties of mind, and it is in the expression of 
these faculties that we must seek the explanation 
of conscious unity. 
6. The Stages and Span of Consciousness 
‘Another important fact which a general consid- 
eration of the nature of consciousness brings for- 
ward is the existence of stages of consciousness. 
These are the modes of presentation of an objéct to 
consciousness. They indicate the amount and 
kind of mental work done upon the content which 
is presented. Three and even four of these stages 
have thus far been distinguished. 
The first stage is that of simple presentation. 
The object is merely given. -It is simply there, 
but nothing further can be stated of it. Simple 
presentations of this sort are constantly coming 
and going in the stream of mental happenings. 
They may possibly leave memory-traces, though 
this is often denied, but for the most part they 
are not reproduced, and, except in contributing
-P-A-G-E-39
20 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
to the fullness of any moment of consciousness, 
they have no appreciable influence upon mental 
life. 
The second stage is attained when we-nole-the 
object given. At this stage we are aware of the 
object’s presence. It is received by a conscious 
mental act, though no further work is done upon 
it at this stage. The many things we observe, 
without attempting to place or understand them, 
belong to-this second stage in the process of presen- 
tation. Our awareness of the object makes more 
certain and lasting the memory-trace which is 
formed than is the case when objects do not pass 
beyond the first stage of presentation. 
The third and culminating stage is attained when 
the object is established in consciousness. We are 
now aware of it as known. To be established in 
consciousness is to be understood in some degree. 
The object means something. This is what we 
call full consciousness of an object. The range of 
understanding is, of course, not indicated. The 
object may be one of which we have very little 
knowledge, and yet be very clearly and definitely 
established in consciousness. 
A fourth stage of consciousness sometimes pre- 
cedes the stage last mentioned. This is the stage 
of potential knowledge The object is not yet fully 
established in consciousness, but the possibility 
of establishing it is already indicated. Thus we 
often say we know a thing when what we really 
mean is that we are conscious of a certain assurance
-P-A-G-E-40
THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS 21 
that if we undertook to do so we could establish 
it. All that is actually presented, however, is the 
object plus certain incipient mental activities of 
which we are conscious. This constitutes the 
stage of potential knowledge when such a differ- 
entiation can be made. But it frequently happens 
that we pass, without a perceptible differentiation 
of stages, from the awareness of an object directly 
to its establishment in consciousness. 
When the question is raised as to the span of 
consciousness, or how much can be experienced 
at one time, our reply is dictated by these facts of 
the conscious stages. The question is equivocal. 
It means different things, according to the stage 
of consciousness which has been attained. At 
the stage of simple presentation, an indefinite 
number of things may be present. At the stage 
of awareness the range is limited to a small group, 
usually not more than five or six. At the final 
stage of established facts there is but one thing in 
consciousness. The mental activities have shifted 
from the receptive attitude of awareness to the 
reflective attitude of meaning. The contents, 
which may be numerous, are unified by the meaning 
which commands the situation. 
The\problem as to the span of consciousness 
is, thergfore, not simple but complicated. It is 
not ansWered by a mere enumeration of objects, 
but only by reference to the mental activities 
involved\in the presentation of these objects. . 
Occasionally, the objects themselves give us direct 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
22 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
and extended information regarding their origin 
and the course of their existence in mind. The 
interesting transformation of a strange object into 
a familiar one can often be traced through the 
gradual accretion of associative adjuncts and the 
modifications in attitude due to a variety of affec- 
tive situations. But there are also changes and 
developments in which the course of evolution is 
not clearly indicated in the object as presented. 
Here we must often theorize on the basis of indices 
of change which can be noted. Explanation is 
thus read into facts which of themselves might 
remain eternally a mystery. In cases of this sort 
we but follow the example of the objective sciences 
when they establish ether currents and vibratory 
phenomena to explain certain facts that would 
otherwise be but unrelated events. The assump- 
tion of unconscious mental activities is always 
tentative until the warrant for such an assumption 
becomes generally recognized. But the testing of 
such tentative assumptions is a matter of scien- 
tific progress, as it is in all other branches of science.
-P-A-G-E-42
CHAPTER Ill 
METHODS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 
7. Introspection and Retrospection 
UR next general consideration deals with 
the methods of psychology. Such a con- 
sideration is demanded because of certain peculiari- 
ties and difficulties which arise in the observation 
of psychological facts. Exact measurement, which 
plays so important a part in natural sciences, is 
applicable only to a limited degree in the study of 
mental happenings. It is largely for this reason 
that the mental sciences are considered apart from 
the ‘natural’ sciences. In place of: observation as 
the means by which the material for mental science 
is collected, it is usual to speak of introspection as 
the distinctively psychological method. The most 
striking difference between the two methods is re- 
vealed in the assumption that observation has an 
‘objective’ reference, indicated by the fact that 
natural science deals with objects of the outer 
world; whereas psychology is introspective, since 
its objects are primarily a matter of individual ex- 
perience. 
A closer view, however, will show us that these 
assumptions are not tenable in any strict sense. 
The psychologist makes observations in the same 
manner in which the physicist or the biologist 
‘ does. In studying the comparative brightness- 
values of a gray surface and a red surface, his obser-
-P-A-G-E-43
24 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
vations are quite as direct, and objective, as those 
of a physicist when he determines experimentally 
the focal length of a lens. The only important 
difference concerns the interpretation of the results 
of the two experiments. The physicist directs his 
observations upon facts which are completely con- 
ditioned without reference to the observer. The 
psychologist, however, is always dealing with facts 
in which the objective conditions, 7.e., the opera- 
tions external to the observer, form but a part of 
the complete conditions for the mental event. This, 
however, means only that the conditions govern- 
ing a psychological fact are more complex and less 
readily isolated than those of a purely physical 
fact. There is no difference in the principles of 
observation involved in the two cases. In observ- 
ing the transit of a star, the astronomer assumes 
that the star is moving through the heavens with a 
velocity which can be expressed in a simple mathe- 
matical equation. It cannot well be supposed to 
proceed by fits and starts, with occasional pauses 
intervening. Hence, if he finds that different ob- 
servations have brought varying results, he knows 
that the observers and not the star are the cause 
of this. In the case of the psychologist, however, 
it is precisely these peculiarities of the observer 
which constitute one of his most pressing problems. 
The objective control exerted by the mechanical 
uniformities of nature are only in part the deter- 
mining causes of his results. He must not only 
consider the observed facts of many individuals
-P-A-G-E-44
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 25 
under constant objective conditions, but he must 
also study the process of observing, both as a psy- 
chophysical problem and as a problem of mental 
activity. The first of these supplementary prob- 
lems leads, as we have seen, to the study of the cor- 
relations of physical stimuli and physiological 
processes with the consciousness under considera- 
tion. But the second, which aims at the nature of 
mental activities, requires him to supplement his 
direct observations with memories. In addition 
to the simple observation of conscious events as 
they occur, he must also study the antecedents and 
consequents of these events. In short, he must 
study mental happenings as they are conditioned 
by past experiences, as they occur in complicated 
states of consciousness, and as they bear upon 
issues which may be intended but not yet realized. 
We may conclude, therefore, that the mere obser- 
vation of a psychological event is as direct as any 
other observation, but that such observations do not 
furnish us with a complete understanding of mind. 
When we are dealing with mental processes in their 
natural setting, we are often forced to allow them 
to run their courses, and make our observations 
afterwards, that is, retrospectively. It cannot be 
denied that this puts many difficulties in the way 
of psychological investigation, difficulties of which 
the natural sciences are fortunately free. Our 
memories are notoriously fallible, and at best are 
but incomplete records of what has taken place. 
Considerations of this sort have led many psy-
-P-A-G-E-45
26 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
chologists to regard the whole introspective — or, 
more properly, retrospective — procedure as al- 
together too indefinite and inexact for scientific 
purposes. They are those who counsel the study 
of behavior as the only scientific method of ap- 
proaching mind, and who would reduce the work 
of our science to the most exact registration of 
direct observations and reactive movements of the 
organism. 
But we need not put the matter in so pessimistic 
a light. In spite of all difficulties in the way of 
exact retrospective records, the fact remains that 
memory is a very useful adjunct to our scheme of 
life, and no man doubts that, though fallible, it is 
in a high degree truthful. Were it otherwise, we 
should be at a loss to explain the reliance which 
every man places upon it, — in the main, with such 
good justification. The capacity of the memory for 
giving a faithful report of past events is simply 
one of the problems with which psychology must 
deal, and it is not impossible to devise experiments 
in which the objective or perfectly ascertainable 
conditions are so important that an accurate meas- 
ure of the capacity of the memory may be secured 
and subjected to detailed study. 
8. Direct and Indirect Observation 
Two methods, then, must be used in the analysis 
and description of conscious contents. These are 
direct observation, which can be applied to such 
events as possess relative permanence and are thus
-P-A-G-E-46
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 27 
capable of isolation; and indirect observation, which 
is required in the case of events that do not 
possess a sufficient degree of permanence to be 
isolated from their natural setting without fear of 
modifying their essential nature. The distinction 
between these two forms of observation is, how- 
ever, not an absolute one. All degrees of per- 
manency and independence are attributable to 
conscious contents. Those which possess these char- 
acteristics in the highest degree are, as already 
stated, most completely determined by the 
physical nature of their stimuli. Those which 
possess them in the least degree are most dependent 
upon physiological processes and the laws of mental 
activity. But all manner of intervening cases occur 
where the conditions are partly internal, and partly 
external to the nervous system. Sometimes an 
indirect observation can be made immediately 
after an experience has occurred, in which case a 
very high degree of validity attaches to the obser- 
vation, since the conscious event does not at once 
disappear, but continues for a short time as a direct 
memory-image, whereby its nature is hardly altered 
at all. At other times the event has its existence 
in a complex of other happenings, and it is neces- 
sary that the complete process should run its 
course in a natural manner in order that it may 
be fully developed. In such cases, our indirect 
observation partakes of the nature of retrospection, 
or a revival of the experience after it has been 
completed. :
-P-A-G-E-47
28 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
When our methodology has become more perfect 
it is quite possible that such indirect observations 
can be dispensed with. Since there is no hard and 
fast line which separates the direct from the in- 
direct method of procedure, it is simply a ques- 
tion of introspective ability to observe the event 
in question when it occurs. At present, we do 
not know enough about the separable qualities of 
these events, as they occur in a complex setting, 
to make such an isolation possible. We are at the 
stage of prospecting, rather than at the stage 
which allows of definite discovery. We must first 
have accurate descriptions of complicated states of 
mind in which contents and mental activities are 
mingled together, before we can proceed to an 
adequate analysis of these contents and acts. After 
we have established the categories of experience for 
which we now search in our prospecting, we shall 
be able to analyze our events and discover the 
elements in a much more direct manner. At 
present, indirect observation serves to indicate 
these elements, but direct tests are necessary before 
they can be definitely established. 
9. Special Methods 
Aside from the direct and indirect methods of 
examining consciousness, there are several other 
methods extensively used in the study of psy- 
chology. There is the method of the behavior- 
ist, to which we have already referred. This is the 
method of observing the behavior of living organ-
-P-A-G-E-48
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 29 
isms, men, animals and even plants. The 
exact observation of behavior under conditions 
that can be rigorously controlled provides a field 
of experimental work which has great possibilities 
and promises psychological data of much value. 
Even occasional observations, which cannot be 
brought into the laboratory for exact control, may 
have a considerable scientific value. Thus the 
behavior of an individual or a group, under the 
stress of extraordinary emotional excitement, has 
often been described and the results corroborated. 
The novelist gives us such descriptions, which we 
accept as true indications of human conduct and 
character. The numerous anecdotes of animal 
behavior are less trustworthy, since we cannot 
appreciate so fully the analogous states of the 
animal mind. Furthermore, it is comparatively 
easy to study the activities of animals, because the 
conditions are readily capable of control. The 
animal is less complicated than the human, and 
most of its mental processes can be excited normally 
in the laboratory. 
Child psychology involves a mixture of intro- 
spection and behavior-research. In the very 
young, we must, of course, rely entirely upon ob- 
servations of behavior, but as the child learns to 
speak, we may supplement our observations by 
questions bearing upon the mental processes which 
have taken place. 
The genetic method is not essentially different 
from this mixture of observed behavior supple-
-P-A-G-E-49
30 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
mented by introspective reports, except that it 
extends beyond the individual to the race. We 
may trace the evolution of behavior in the child as 
he proceeds to manhood. This is correlated with 
his physical development. We are also afforded 
comparative data by the study of races at different 
stages of cultural advancement, and by the historic 
remains of primitive ancestors. Much data of 
this sort is afforded us by zodlogical research. Our 
problem is to trace a psychological evolution as 
counterpart to the physiological evolution of living 
beings. 
Among the special methods which are fruitful in 
psychology may be mentioned certain aspects of 
experimentation. Both the direct and indirect 
observations which we have mentioned, as well as 
the exact study of behavior, are best pursued under 
experimental conditions. We may distinguish two 
kinds of experiment, according as we direct our 
inquiry upon experience or behavior. Among the 
special types of behavior that have been found 
significant is the study of changes of pulse, respira- 
tion, volume and muscular strength, which attend 
experiences of varying orders. A special type of 
experiment bearing more directly upon experi- 
ence is that which deals with the ‘artificially nar- 
rowed consciousness ’ of the hypnotized subject. 
Two kinds of non-experimental method are also 
‘pursued in the name of psychology. The first of 
these is the rational philosophic method of study- 
ing mind, which proceeds deductively upon the
-P-A-G-E-50
PSYCHOLOGICAL. ANALYSIS 31 
basis of general philosophical assumptions, and 
attempts to give mind its proper setting in the 
universe. A second non-experimental method con- 
cerns itself with expressions of mind such as are 
discoverable in historic remains, literature, art, 
customs, language, etc. 
10. Interpretation 
It is evident that in all these methods a very im- 
portant feature is the interpretation which is placed 
upon the data secured. In order that the inter- 
pretation may be correct the data must be ade- 
quate. We must control the observations of one 
person by the observations made under the same 
conditions by others, and also by observations of 
the same person made at different times. Since 
mind is so complicated and variable in its expres- 
sions, the exact control of the objective conditions 
under which the observations are made cannot be 
too strictly enforced. Many observations bearing 
upon the same event are desirable in order that 
an average result may be obtained, which in some 
measure lessens the discrepancies arising on ac- 
count of individual differences and varying degrees 
of practice. 
11. Two Conditioning Laws: Problem.and Direction 
It is important to note that all adequate obser- 
vation is influenced and made possible by two fun- 
damental laws of mental activity. The first of 
these laws refers to the problem. All mental
-P-A-G-E-51
32 THE PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY 
processes are set in operation by the problems 
which we have consciously before us. If we are 
attempting to equalize the brightness-values of a 
gray and a red surface, a certain mental attitude 
is aroused, which makes the events relevant to 
this observation stand out from among the numer- 
ous irrelevant experiences which accompany it. 
The problem and the sensory stimulus for the 
activity form a mental complex, which operates as 
a general condition for the events that follow. 
The second law refers to the direction which the 
process takes. Itis supplementary to the first law, 
for not only is a problem set, but the operations 
that follow are controlled by the aims implicitly 
contained in the problem. Thus the occurrence of 
relevant events is dictated, while other events, 
which occur for various reasons, are ignored 
when they do not agree with the aims set by the 
problem. This directive selection is not only 
operative in cases of direct observation, but is 
also very influential in the revival of important 
and relevant material in indirect observation. 
These are not the only laws of mental activity 
which operate to make observation of mental 
events possible, but they are the two which are 
most important, and they will suffice to give us an 
understanding of the point of view adopted in 
this book.

CHAPTER IV 
VISION 
12. Sensation in General 
E are now prepared to undertake an analysis 
of consciousness, — to attempt a survey of 
the structural elements with which mind carries on’ 
its operations. The feature of consciousness that 
strikes us first and most of all is its power of re- 
vealing the world in which we live. Its revelations 
are based to a large extent upon elements known 
as sensations. This we infer by observing that 
certain points of our bodies are sensitive to physical 
stimulation. An examination of these sensitive 
points or areas affords a safe beginning in our 
study of sensation. We shall be greatly helped in 
determining these points and areas by an under- 
standing of the physiological nature of the body 
and of the nervous system, both central (brain 
and spinal cord) and peripheral. Many of these 
sensitive sites, of course, are at once apparent to us, 
— for instance, the eyes, the ears, the mouth, the 
nose and the skin. It is a commonplace that man 
has five senses, known as seeing, hearing, tasting, 
smelling and touching. But to be exact this popu- 
lar account must be extended, for the analysis is 
too general, and we have reason to suppose that 
it is incomplete. We may, however, begin with a 
study of these five senses, which will afterward 
carry us into a more complete survey of our sensory 
experience.
-P-A-G-E-55
36 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
18. The Conditions of Vision 
Seeing is a process which involves physical, 
physiological and psychological facts. The infor- 
mation contributed by our eyes concerning the 
world lying about us must in the first place depend 
upon certain physical stimulations which this outer 
world supplies. The physicist tells us that these 
are ether waves issuing originally from luminous 
bodies, but which are also reflected in various ways 
from other bodies not themselves luminous. Thus 
we see not only the sun and the lamp, from which the 
light rays issue directly, but also the moon, the wall 
and the tree, which only reflect the rays of the sun 
or some other source of light. But in order to see 
these things it is also requisite that we should 
possess a physiological organ which is peculiarly 
attuned to this sort of stimulation, and which ac- 
cordingly responds in certain definite ways to the 
light rays that penetrate it. i/The eye is such an 
organ, and its manner of response to the light waves 
determines in a large measure what we shall see. 
If by reason of disease or injury to its delicate struc- 
ture or its nervous connections, it fails to respond, 
we have the condition of blindness. This is not, as 
some people suppose, a continual darkness for the 
sufferer, but simply an absence of every sensation 
which we characterize as visual, either light or 
dark. There are many instances, too, in which 
individuals have abnormal vision due to optical 
defects of one sort or another, as the cases of
-P-A-G-E-56
VISION 37 
near-sighted, far-sighted and astigmatic vision, 
attributable to structural variations in the parts 
of the eye. Again, and more strikingly from a 
psychological point of view, there are the cases 
of color-blindness, in which individuals fail to 
discriminate certain colors which the normal eye 
sees distinctly. , 
14. The Classification of Visual Sensations 
Psychologically considered; the vision of the 
normal human eye can be analyzed into two great 
classes of sensation, the colored and the colorless. 
All colors may be classified according to their red- 
ness, yellowness, greenness and blueness, but no 
color can belong to more than two of these classes, 
and the two to which it may belong must be adja- 
cent in the series named, with the additional pro- 
vision that blue be regarded as adjacent to red. 
Thus we have before us a simple scheme for classi- 
fying all possible colors. As a result we may dis- 
tinguish principal colors and intermediate colors. 
The principal colors are the four above mentioned: 
red, yellow, green and blue, which attain their 
special prominence by reason of the fact that we 
can say of them, as we can say of no other colors, 
that no one of them resembles any one of the 
other three. Each one of these is sud generis, and 
thus a truly elemental form of experience. It is 
impossible to describe one of these in any terms 
save those which are synonymous with the color 
itself. The intermediate colors, however, always
-P-A-G-E-57
38 THE ANALYTIC FACTS. OF MIND 
resemble two and only two of the principal colors. 
Thus, intermediate between thé reds and yellows, 
is a series of gradations which, beginning with a 
red having just a tinge of yellow, varies with con~ 
stantly increasing amounts of yellow through the 
tones of orange until the color approaches pure 
yellow. Similarly, these gradations are found 
between yellow and green, between green and blue, 
and finally between blue and red, thus completing 
the circle. A fairly adequate illustration of this 
fact is given in the solar spectrum, which results 
from the refraction of a ray of sunlight by a prism, 
the different waves constituting the ray of white 
light being bent at different angles, in accord- 
ance with their wave-lengths, so as to produce a 
band of colors which represents these gradations. 
Lacking only are some of the gradations that 
occur between blue and red, the two ends of the 
spectrum being psychologically incomplete. 
The colorless visual sensations in their turn 
present a simple series of gradations from black to 
white. Black and white have not the absolute 
significance which attaches to the principal colors, 
because black and white are but relative terms in 
a series of grays. A maximum degree of whiteness 
might be assumed, but it would be impossible to 
determine what it is, because with increased illu- 
mination we finally reach a stage where it is no 
longer possible for us to regard the object on ac- 
count of its dazzling brilliancy. With blackness, 
on the other hand, we might suppose that this
-P-A-G-E-58
VISION 39 
could be obtained in an absolute degree by the 
simple method of excluding light rays from the eye. 
But this is not the case, for what we see after we 
become adapted to our perfectly dark surroundings 
is not black, but a dark gray. It is evident, then, 
that black and white are relative terms, which 
apply to a series of gradations in gray, the limits of 
which it is impossible for us to fix with any degree 
of accuracy. Still, we cannot disregard the fact 
that black and white are commonly accepted as 
psychological opposites. Despite the difficulty of 
attaching either term to a concrete experience 
which is absolutely fixed, these extremes remain 
the most characteristic features of the colorless 
series. Gray, from which they are both in a sense 
derived, is a vague term in comparison. The 
black-white opposition is so firmly established in 
experience that we shall continue to characterize 
the colorless series by reference to its extremes, 
rather than by its common quality of grayness. 
To make our usage unambiguous, we must de- 
scribe the colorless series as gradations from black 
to white through intermediate grays, just as we 
proceed from red to yellow through intermediate 
tones of orange. The fact that we also pass through 
a series of gradations in brightness is another matter. 
Brightness is attributive to the elements of black, 
white and their mixtures. The brightness-degree 
varies, in the main, with the progression from black 
to white. But this is not always the case. We do 
not hesitate to refer to the white snows and gray
-P-A-G-E-59
40 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
skies of winter, although the snow is always much 
darker than the sky. 
But brightness is not merely a characteristic of 
the colorless series. It applies equally to all visual 
sensations. Thus the two series of colored and 
colorless sensations are related. The principal 
colors which we have analyzed and described vary 
through their intermediaries. They may also vary 
in brightness, by becoming lighter or darker. In 
describing a color, then, it is not only necessary to 
determine which of the four principal colors is 
presented, — whether it be a pure color, or, if it 
be an intermediate color, which two principal colors 
are involved,— but we must also determine its place 
in the brightness-series, whether it be lighter or 
darker than some arbitrary standard which we may 
erect. Nor does this exhaust the possibilities of 
analysis and description, since it is also possible for 
a color to vary while its color-tone and brightness 
remain constant. We can have more or less of the 
color without any necessary change to brighter or 
darker. This last variation is referred to ~~ ‘* 
degree of saturation, and variations of thi: 
occur whenever a color is mixed, so to spéa.., «su 
grays which are lighter, darker or of an equal degree 
of brightness. We can also attribufe saturation to 
the colorless series, meaning here the degree in 
which a black, white or gray is free of all color- 
tone. 
Summarizing, we may say that the black-white 
sensations vary mainly in their degrees of brightness
-P-A-G-E-60
VISION 4l 
and saturation. Colors, however, vary in three 
independent ways: (1) by gradation of color-tone 
through intermediaries towards their adjacent 
colors; (2) by gradation in brightness, becoming 
lighter or darker; and (3) by gradation in satura- 
tion, that is, admixture with blacks, whites or 
grays. In this third case they may become lighter 
or darker, or remain at a constant brightness. Any 
one of these variations can be made independently 
of the others. The only fixed points in these varia- 
tions are (1) the ideal point of purity which exists 
for each color at one definite degree of brightness; 
and (2) the limiting points at which the colors in 
their variations of saturation and brightness ap- 
proach the colorless series by extreme lightening or 
darkening, or the admixture with any other degrees 
of colorless visual sensation. 
16. Visual Adaptation and Contrast 
Two other important facts presented by the 
visual sensations may be discussed under the 
heads of adaptation and contrast. 
Adaptation signifies a certain instability of vis- 
ual sensations, which is expressed by the law. 
that all steadily fixated blacks, whites and colors tend 
towards a neutral gray of medium brighiness. Thus 
colors lose their saturation and their extremes 
of lightness or darkness, while blacks and whites 
tend towards an intermediate degree of brightness. 
Contrast signifies the reciprocal effects which 
exist between visual sensations. This is partially
-P-A-G-E-61
42 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
expressed by the law that for every color another can 
be found which, when mixed with it in proper propor- 
tion, will result in complete cancellation of both colors 
and the appearance of a gray sensation. Colors 
which possess this reciprocal relationship are known 
as complementaries. Roughly speaking, the com- 
plementary pairs of principal colors are blue and. 
yellow, red and green. But this is not strictly 
true in the case of the last mentioned pair, for in 
order to effect a complete cancellation between red 
and green a small amount of blue must be added. 
Contrast-effects in colors may all be classified by 
reference to this law. In the colorless series, 
where there are, of course, no true complemen- 
taries, there exists nevertheless a similar reciprocal 
relationship between the extremes of black and 
white. 
Visual contrasts are of two sorts, simultaneous 
and successive. In simultaneous contrast we find a 
peculiar heightening effect which is produced when~ 
ever we look at two areas whose sensory quality 
differs. This effect is to render the lighter of the 
two areas lighter, and the darker one, darker. In 
addition, if one or both of the two areas be colored, 
the complementary colors are induced from one 
area upon the other. Thus, the proximity of a 
blue and a gray causes the gray to become yellow- 
ish, and the blue to become more blue. If the blue 
and gray be of the same degree of brightness, these 
color-effects will be most conspicuous, otherwise 
the darker of the two will become darker, and the
-P-A-G-E-62
VISION 43 
lighter will become lighter, in which process the en- 
hancement of color may be interfered with, or en- 
tirely set aside. Other conditions which enhance 
contrast are (1) nearness of the contrasting sur- 
faces, (2) the elimination of contours or boundary 
lines between them, and (3) the increase of satura- 
tion in the inducing sensation. 
When any two colors are contrasted, the comple- 
mentary of the one will tend to be induced upon the 
other. If blue and yellow are thus contrasted, the 
effect is to enhance both colors. If a difference in 
brightness also occurs, however, this will operate 
adversely to such enhancement, since the lighter 
of the two colors, say yellow, will tend, by contrast 
in brightness, to become yet lighter, which means 
that the yellow must suffer somewhat in saturation, 
while the blue, becoming darker, will also suffer in 
a similar manner. Assuming equal degrees of 
brightness, the complementary colors will be those 
most conspicuously enhanced through contrast. 
In the case of non-complementary colors the re- 
sults are complicated by induced color-admixture. 
Let us take for an example the contrast of red 
and yellow. Assuming equality of brightness, the 
yellow will induce its complementary, blue, upon the 
red surface, and in mingling an intermediate color 
will result, namely, a red with a bluish tinge. But 
the complementary of red which is induced upon 
the yellow is not the principal color, green, but an 
intermediate color, bluish-green. The green com- 
ponent adds itself directly to the yellow to give it
-P-A-G-E-63
44 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
a greenish tinge, but the blue component, being 
antagonistic to yellow, tends towards its cancel- 
lation. The result is a greenish yellow, the satu- 
ration of which is slightly decreased rather than — 
enhanced. It is of such contrasts as this that we 
say one color has ‘killed’ another. 
Successive contrast results when a visual stimula- 
tion, which has continued until some degree of 
adaptation has set in, is removed. Under such 
conditions, the complementary color and opposite 
brightness become spontaneously effective. We 
become adapted through wearing blue glasses, and 
no longer detect the blueness of our surroundings. 
But when the glasses are removed, we find the world 
bathed in a glow of yellow. As we shift our gaze 
from one object to another, the brightness and the 
color of each object at which we look are in some 
degree determined by the brightness and color of 
the object at which we have just ceased to look. 
These after-effects may also be projected before 
us, as images, and when the stimulation has been 
sufficiently definite and intensive, many interest~ 
ing effects are produced. There is the simple 
negative after-image, as it is called, which gives us the 
complementary color and opposite brightness of the 
original. We also note that color and brightness 
are independently variable, with a strong tendency 
towards fluctuation. Thus, we become acquainted 
with positive after-images, in which either the bright- 
ness or color of the original, or both, may be 
reasserted without the attendance of the normal
-P-A-G-E-64
VISION 45 
stimulus. To secure a positive image the stimulus 
must be intensive. These positive effects are usually 
brief, and occur primarily before the negative image 
forms. But under favorable conditions fluctua- 
tions of considerable duration may be set up, which 
give us‘alternate bright and dark images, and a 
shifting color, variegated tones of which succeed 
one another in a manner described as the ‘flight of 
colors’. In the main, these changes may be re- 
duced to order when we consider the independence 
of the black-white and color series. Positive and 
negative effects of brightness combine with and 
modify the original and complementary effects of 
color. It is found that the dark image is more 
effective for the blues and greens, while the light 
image enhances the reds and yellows. 
We may enlarge slightly upon this last fact in 
partial explanation of the differences noted between 
daylight and twilight vision. In bright daylight 
it is the reds and yellows which are most con- 
spicuous. These colors suffer less in saturation 
when. subjected to a high degree of illumination 
than do the other two principal colors. It is 
for this reason that they are termed the ‘warm’, 
colors. The ‘cold’ colors, blue and green, are, on 
the contrary, less affected by decreased illumina- 
tion, and are therefore the only colors which are 
strikingly effective at twilight. 
The causes which underly these facts of visual 
sensation are in part physical, and in part physio- 
logical. Some of them are well understood, while
-P-A-G-E-65
46 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
others are subject to conflicting theories. As our 
present purpose is limited to a survey of the more 
general aspects of mental contents and activities, 
we must close with this brief account of the elements 
of vision and some of their more important relation- 
ships, leaving the interesting problems of their 
psychophysical correlations, together with the 
many additional facts which such a study reveals, 
to the special province of experimental psychology.
-P-A-G-E-66
CHAPTER V 
AUDITION 
16. The Conditions of Hearing 
EARING is also a process which involves 
physical, physiological and psychological 
facts. As in the case of vision, we must here be 
satisfied with a brief outline, leaving the more de- 
tailed considerations of fact and theory for special 
courses that bear more directly upon the psycho- 
physical correlations. 
The physical facts involved in hearing are the 
vibrations of an elastic medium, which is usually 
the air. The air is made to vibrate by all manner 
of instruments, and when its vibrations have at- 
tained a frequency varying approximately between 
16 and 20,000 vibrations per second, these, when 
communicated to the ear, are productive of sound. 
Again, as in the case of vision, the physiological 
capacity of the organ plays its part in the determina- 
tion of what shall be heard. Not only is the range 
of its activities limited to certain vibration-fre- 
quencies, as above noted, but it also contributes 
sensations which find no direct correlates in the 
sound-waves of the air. Furthermore, abnormal 
conditions of the organ occasion other discrep- 
ancies between the sound-waves and the sound- 
sensations.
-P-A-G-E-67
48 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
17. The Classification of Sounds: (1) Tonal Pitch 
Psychologically, we have two great classes of 
sounds, which we term éones and noises. An im- 
portant characteristic of tones, by the aid of which 
we are able to analyze and define them, is pitch. 
By pitch we refer to the fact that tones may be 
‘high’ or ‘low’. This enables us to arrange all 
possible tones in a series similar to the brightness- 
series. We may start at one end with the ‘lowest’ 
perceptible toné, which corresponds to the fre- 
quencies of vibrating bodies approximating 16 per 
second. From this, if we raise the pitch by in- 
creasing the vibration-frequency, we approach 
the maximum or ‘highest’ discernible tone, which 
is attained at approximately 20,000 vibrations per 
second. 
It is needless to say that the use of ‘high’ and 
‘low’ to describe this pitch-variation is purely figu- 
rative. The rather unusual application of these 
terms bears witness to our disposition to establish 
analogies, and thus to import into one field terms 
that really belong to another. In this case, how- 
ever, it may be assumed that the reader knows what 
is meant by a tone’s pitch. It is a characteristic 
of all tones, and thus enables us to place them in a 
serial order. 
18. (2) Tonal Character, Fusion and ‘Beats’ 
But the simple progression from low to high does 
not completely characterize the tonal series. In 
this progression there exist recurrent similarities
-P-A-G-E-68
AUDITION 49 
of tone. The most striking of these resemblances is 
that known in music as the ocfave. Two notes whose 
vibration-frequency is 1:2 or a power of 2, have very 
different pitch, but very similar quality. In music 
they are given the same name, and all systems of 
music.seem to recognize their essential identity. 
This fact conditions the existence of musical scales. 
A musical scale is any fixed progression of tones 
within an octave. The name octave is used to 
describe the eight-note interval which has been 
fundamental in the development of occidental 
music. But we have now progressed beyond this, 
and there are twelve tones in our musical scale, 
whereas other races, notably those of the Orient, 
have developed scales on different principles, which 
contain five, seven and other numbers of tones. 
But the essential identity of tones in the ‘octave’ 
relationship is not the only significant feature of 
a progression of tones from low to high. The num- 
ber of tones that can be distinguished within any 
given octave is dependent upon the region under 
investigation within the total progression. Many 
more tones can be discriminated in the middle 
region than in the region of low and high tones. 
Furthermore, the relationships which may be estab- 
lished between successive and simultaneous tones 
within the octave present a complicated problem, 
which in its diverse solutions has resulted in the 
different types of music that man has evolved. . 
We cannot enter into the details of this problem 
here, but we may indicate a few of its most striking
-P-A-G-E-69
50 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
features. In the first place, any given tone pos- 
sesses a certain character, which it retains even 
when its pitch is slightly altered. This character 
or individuality is not at all determined by the 
vibration-frequency. It attaches to any tone, and 
reaches out over a slight range of tones both higher 
and lower in pitch. Character is determined by 
the system of tones, or scale, in which the tone 
in question has its place. Such a musical setting 
is predetermined in various ways, according to the 
musical education of the person apprehending the 
tone. With a minimum of such predetermination 
from past experience the tone in question would 
usually be regarded as the keynote of a scale — that 
is, the first note of an octave. It is, apparently, 
this fundamental fact which gives individuality 
to tones. If the tone assumes the character of 
any other note in the scale, it does so by reference 
to another note not present but thought of, which 
is the keynote of that scale. 
Hence, we see that the individuality of these 
tones is not purely sensory, but seems also to depend 
upon something which is thought into the tone. 
This appears to be true of all musical relation- 
ships, but it is impossible at the present time 
to determine, apart from the octave relationship, 
which relations are founded upon original capacities 
of the ear or brain, and which are acquired. 
It is also an open question to what degree the 
musical relationships in a scale are dependent on 
pitch, that is, highness and lowness, and how much
-P-A-G-E-70
AUDITION si 
they depend upon the musical setting provided by 
the octave. 
It has been recently shown that in a patholog- 
ical case, the patient retained his sense of pitch, 
but suffered a certain alteration in his apprehension 
of musical relationships. For instance, the notes 
C and G, appeared to be in octave relationship. 
Yet when this interval was compared with the true 
octave C-C;, he could detect invariably the greater 
interval and lower pitch of C; as compared with Gy. 
This indicates that pitch and character are to 
some extent independently variable. Pitch-inter- 
vals and musical intervals are not identical. We 
see an evidence of this in the unmusical person 
who cannot ‘carry a tune’, but can reproduce the 
ascending and descending trend of a melody, al- 
though he does not always hit the right notes. 
It is these resemblances and differences of charac- 
ter within the pitch-series which make music pos- 
sible. Tones which resemble one another in such 
a manner that when sounded together they tend 
to fuse and form a more or less unified whole 
are called consonant. Tones which do not possess 
this capacity to fuse are called dissonant. More 
complicated are some of the relationships existing 
between dissonant tones. Those which hold be- 
tween tones of neighboring pitch are perhaps the 
most striking. When the pitch-difference is very 
slight, the two tones, successively sounded, may be 
regarded as possessing the same character. When 
simultaneously sounded, they often reveal peculiar
-P-A-G-E-71
52 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
sound-phenomena known as beais. The two tones 
appear to fluctuate one with the other. This 
fact is attributable to a reciprocal interference 
which is set up between the two waves, thus occa- 
sioning periodic reénforcement and diminution of 
the intensities of sound. The number of beats 
that can be discerned indicates the exact differ- 
ence in vibration-rate between the two tones which 
occasion them. Upon increasing the pitch-difference 
there develops a certain ‘roughness’, in which the 
beats are no longer clearly distinguishable. After 
a time we arrive at a tone which is clearly distinct 
as to character, yet a relationship of propinquity 
may still be discovered in that the two tones seem 
to go together. when successively sounded. This, 
however, carries us beyond our present problem of 
tonal analysis. 
19. (3) Mellowness, Shrillness and Timbre of 
Tones 
To complete this analysis we must refer to two 
further facts. First, there is an attribute of tone 
which correlates directly with the pitch-series. 
All low tones are mellow, and all high tones are 
shrill, This additional feature seems to absorb the 
tonal character when the sound is very low or very 
high. In consequence, it is difficult to establish 
resemblances and relations of a musical sort with 
very low tones, and quite impossible to do so with 
very high tones. 
The second fact to be noted has reference to
-P-A-G-E-72
AUDITION 53 
tonal complexes. In our preceding analysis we 
have assumed pure tones, which correspond to 
simple pendular-formed vibrations. But such vi- 
brations seldom exist naturally, and the tones we 
usually hear are not pure, but are mixtures of 
many sounds: tones and noises. These mixtures 
are attributable to various physical causes. The 
chief one for us to consider is the partial vibration. 
It is a physical fact that when a body is set in 
vibration, it tends to carry out its movements in 
any and all ways possible. In the case of a rela- 
tively simple form of vibratory body, such as a 
stretched string, this means that in addition to the 
vibration of the string as a whole between its fixed 
ends, there also occur part-vibrations, in which the 
string is divided into halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, 
etc., these being the partial vibrations that can 
occur with least hindrance. As a result, we hear, 
in addition to the fundamental tone, a series of 
overtones, which correspond to these partial vibra- 
tions. These overtones form a definite series 
which may be indicated as 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, etc., 
x being the vibration-rate of the fundamental. 
The partial tones which extend upwards in pitch 
to the limit of hearing are all represented in this 
series. Some may be more intensive than others, 
owing to the physical nature of the producing in- 
strument, and in some cases the even numbered 
partials are not present. 
It is significant that the relations which are thus 
expressed between the successive partials, and
-P-A-G-E-73
54 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
between them and the fundamental, embrace all 
the important intervals of music. Whenever in 
such a complex sound it is still possible to detect 
a dominant tone, 7.e., a definite pitch and char- 
acter, we refer to the additional tones and noises 
which contribute to the sound as the tone’s timbre 
or ‘clang-color’. Thus it is that we detect dif- 
ferences between tones of a constant pitch and 
identical character which are produced by different 
instruments, — a violin and a piano, a horn and a 
voice. If all these additional elements were ex- 
cluded, as they can be with the aid of suitable 
physical devices, we should find the two tones to be 
the same. 
20. (4) Noise 
This leads us directly to the analysis of our second 
class of sounds: the noises. Noise is generally re- 
garded as a complicated sound in which it is im- 
possible to detect a simple character or pitch. It 
is not easy to establish any definite line of demar- 
cation between tones and noises, because most 
tones have some noise about them, that is, certain 
complex parts, the character and pitch of which 
we fail to detect; and, similarly, most noises have 
something tonal in them, that is, some dominant 
character or pitch with which musical relationship 
can be established. Thus there is a certain amount 
of noise in the notes of a flute, and some tone about 
the sound that results from rapping on a piece of 
wood.
-P-A-G-E-74
AUDITION 55 
There may be, as some contend, an elementary 
quality of noise. Others think that there is no 
such simple quality. Noise, they maintain, is a 
complex, unanalyzed fact of experience. If we 
could analyze it, we should find it to be constituted 
entirely of tones. We cannot settle this question 
at present, but we do know that the character of a 
noise differs from that of a tone chiefly for the 
reason that a noise has no place in a musical scale. 
It is often possible, however, to give it a place in 
the pitch-series, for noises are mellow or shrill, 
and may be justly regarded as high or low. It is - 
also a fact that very high and very low sounds are 
more like noises than tones, even though they are 
produced by simple pendular-formed vibrations. 
This is not because we are unable to place them in 
the pitch-series, but because we cannot place them 
definitely with reference to an octave. They lack, 
in other words, the specific musical character which 
a tone will ordinarily possess. 
The physical principles that underly these phe- 
nomena, and condition them in a very large de- 
gree, are in many respects quite definite, and thus 
permit us to understand these psychological facts 
much better than we should if we were forced 
to rely upon our psychological analysis alone. 
Thus the physicist shows us that it is possible to 
analyze all complex waves into simple pendular 
components. Furthermore, the facts of partial 
tones and beats, which we have already mentioned, 
belong more largely to physical than to psycho-
-P-A-G-E-75
56 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
logical analysis. It can be shown that these 
physical facts correlate directly with psychological 
analysis, but they have no proper place in our 
present plan, and must therefore be left un- 
touched.
-P-A-G-E-76
CHAPTER VI 
TASTE, SMELL AND TOUCH 
21. Taste 
ASTING is a far less important sense than 
the two which we have been considering, 
and its psychophysical relations are less clearly 
understood. We know that the organs of taste 
are situated in the mouth, mainly upon the upper 
surface of the tongue, and that they respond to 
certain liquids when brought into contact with 
them. But precisely how these little organs, em- 
bedded in the mouth’s tissues, act, and precisely 
what ‘chemical affinities they may possess, is a 
matter for future investigation. Psychologically, 
however, we are able to classify all tastes in four 
categories: sweets, sours, bitters and salts. The 
validity of this analysis is shown only when we 
have taken care to eliminate all sensations other 
than taste. It is evident that our mouths are not 
only sensitive to taste, but also to the various forms 
of cutaneous experience which we have provi- 
sionally referred to as touching. But, in addition, 
the nose is in close proximity to the mouth, and 
what we taste we may also smell. Yet if we 
eliminate these other elements as far as possible, 
is seems plain that sweet, sour, bitter and salt are 
the only clearly distinguishable elements which 
taste affords us. So far as the mouth is concerned, 
tea and coffee may be the same; lemonade and a 
tartaric acid solution are identical.
-P-A-G-E-77
58 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
22. Smell 
Smelling, however, presénts a more complicated 
range “of facts. There is nothing very striking 
about the end-organs situated in the upper nasal 
cavities, and we can say no more about the phys- 
ical properties of their stimuli than that they are 
gaseous, or the effluvia which are found in certain 
gases. Nor are we much better off, psychologically. 
We know that the odors have a considerable range, 
and some attempts have been made to classify 
them, but none has been very successful. One 
reason for this lack of knowledge concerning smell 
is the fact that the organs adapt themselves very 
quickly in the presence of an odor, and we cease to 
apprehend it. We are, therefore, obliged to dismiss 
this group of sensations, which apparently plays 
so large a part in the behavior of some animals, as 
the dog, and which contributes no mean share to 
man’s appreciation of nature, with a very slight 
knowledge as to the elements involved. 
23. Touch 
Touching, the last of the ‘common-sense’ groups 
which we have adopted as an outline for our anal- 
ysis of sensation, is much better understood. It 
was formerly believed that all bodily tissues were 
sensitive to touch. More exact investigations have | 
shown this view to be erroneous. Although widely 
distributed throughout the body, this group of 
sensations is always correlated with specific end-
-P-A-G-E-78
TASTE, SMELL AND TOUCH 59 
organs, as are the other sensations with which we 
have dealt. Furthermore, we find that it is not 
one element, but at least four, with which we have 
to deal, and it is highly probable that each of the 
different elements has its own specific end-organs, 
as well as specific types of physical stimuli. 
It is customary to classify these sensations, be- 
cause of their wide distribution, with reference to 
the situation and use of their end-organs. Thus, 
we have the cutaneous sensations, which are derived 
from the skin; the kinesthetic sensations, which 
accompany movements of the body, and are accord- 
ingly ‘situated in the muscles, tendons and joints; 
and, finally, the organic-sensations, which arise from 
certain of the internal organs, notably in the region 
of the lungs and alimentary canal. Of these groups 
the sensations from the skin are best understood, 
becausé they are most readily investigated. We 
shall, accordingly, begin with them. 
1. Cutaneous Sensations 
Cutaneous experience consists in at least four 
distinct elements. These are commonly known as 
pressure, or touch; pain; warmth; and cold. Sen- 
sibility of these four sorts is distributed pointwise 
over the skin of the body. The distribution is, 
however, uneven. Some portions of the skin, as, 
for instance, the palms of the hands and the finger- 
tips, are provided with very numerous end-organs, 
while other surfaces, such as the back and the 
thighs, find the end-organs much less frequent in
-P-A-G-E-79
60 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
a corresponding area. Furthermore, the pain-spots 
appear to be most numerous; then, the pressure- 
spots; next, the cold-spots; and, finally, the 
warmth-spots. The demonstration of this discrete 
sensitivity is a simple matter if we apply the ap- 
propriate’stimuli at different points on the skin. 
To stimulate pain, the hard outer coating of the 
skin must be pierced. If we use a fine needle, we 
find points which respond with a sharp sensation 
of pain, while others are quite indifferent. Simi- 
larly, the pressure exerted by the end of a hair will 
produce a sensation of touch at certain points, and 
be unnoticed at others. For cold the stimulus 
must be somewhat below, and for warmth some- 
what above, the temperature of the skin. If the 
difference be too great, however, a sensation of pain 
may result which makes the warmth or cold diffi- 
cult to detect. There appear to be no specific 
end-organs for pain, but this sensation is mediated 
by numerous ‘free’ nerve-endings, which pene- 
trate the skin and extend very near the surface. 
In order to stimulate them they must be directly 
attacked by some agency from within or without. 
It is not definitely known if other nerves than these 
also mediate pain-sensation. With regard to pres- 
sure, it has been shown that the mediating nerves 
are attached to the roots of the hairs and to cer- 
tain little cells found in the hairless portions of 
the skin. Any movement of the skin adjacent to 
these bodies suffices to arouse a sensation of pres- 
sure. With reference to warmth and cold, finally,
-P-A-G-E-80
TASTE, SMELL AND TOUCH 61 
no specific end-organs have as yet been differen- 
tiated, but the pointwise sensitivity is quite as 
certain as in the case of the other two sensations. 
Cutaneous experience frequently involves mix- 
tures of these elements. Among the most interest- 
ing of these are the experiences of tickling and 
tiching, but it is uncertain whether these are pro- 
duced by definite combinations of diffuse pressure, 
warmth and pain, or whether they are due entirely 
to various modes of stimulating pressure. 
2. Kinesthetic Sensations 
The kinesthetic sensations are mediated by 
small end-organs situated in the muscles, tendons 
and joints. They provide the characteristic ex- 
periences of bodily movement and are always diffuse. 
It is impossible at the present time to state with 
certainty whether they involve elements differing 
essentially from those mentioned, or not. Prob- 
ably they do not, as pressure and pain seem to be 
the most striking features of their content. 
3. Organic Sensations 
The same may be said of the organic sensations, 
although here we have often to deal with com- 
plexes, such as nausea, suffocation, hunger and 
thirst, which have so many adjuncts in their per- 
ceptual character that it is well nigh impossible 
to subject them to very careful analysis. These 
visceral sensations, as they are termed, play an 
important part in our emotional experiences. . Feel-
-P-A-G-E-81
62 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
ings of elation and depression, bodily well-being, 
or illness, all depend in large measure upon sensory 
complexes of this order. It has also been estab- 
lished that the feeling of personality, so far as it is 
dependent upon sensations derived from the body, 
is largely attributive to these visceral complexes. 
24. Static Sensations 
One other group of sensations, the existence of 
which is, however, debatable, remains for considera- 
tion. This group, if it exists, is mediated by organs 
situated in the labyrinth adjacent to the inner ear 
and known as the vestibule and semi-circular canals. 
These organs constitute an apparatus which is 
apparently designed for the purpose of controlling 
the equilibrium of the body. Embedded in the 
bones of the skull on each side of the head are three 
little canals, placed with reference to one another 
in the three geometrical planes. They are filled 
with a watery fluid, and provided with nerves 
terminating in hair-cells. The hairs extend into 
the fluid: and are affected mechanically by the 
movements of it which occur when the head moves. 
' By reason of the relative positions of these canals, 
we have a means of analyzing movements of the 
head in any ‘direction. It is probable that these 
stimulations occasion nervous reflexes which set 
up certain appropriate coérdinations of the bodily 
muscles, thus preventing disequilibrium. 
The organs of the vestibule are more primitive, 
consisting in minute particles of calcareous sub-
-P-A-G-E-82
TASTE, SMELL AND TOUCH 63 
stance, known as otoliths, which rest upon hairs. 
They operate by gravity to stimulate the nerves 
connected with the hair-cells for a purpose which 
is apparently similar to that served by the semi- 
circular canals. 
It is maintained by some that the experience of 
dizziness includes sensations derived from these 
organs, but it has thus far been impossible to iso- 
late these with certainty. Furthermore, no nerv- 
ous connections have as yet been established 
between these organs and the cerebrum. The 
nerves seem all to terminate in the cerebellum, 
which is the centre of cotrdinated activity, but 
not of consciousness. It may therefore be the 
case, with man, at least, that no sensation origi- 
nates in these organs, their service being entirely 
on the plane of a purely physiological reflex.
-P-A-G-E-83
CHAPTER VII 
THE ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION 
25. General Discussion 
N the preceding sections we have made more 
than one reference to aspects or phases of sen- 
sational contents which we termed attributive. 
We must now give this matter a more extended 
consideration. What is meant precisely by the 
attributes of sensation, and what are they? An 
attribute of sensation, as commonly defined, is a 
dependent aspect of the content, which is inde- 
pendently variable. It depends upon the content 
for its existence, but it may vary in certain ways 
without altering the essential nature of the con- 
tent. For example, a tone ‘c’ may be loud or soft, 
and yet remain the same tone. A color ‘red’ may 
be round or square in area, and yet remain the same 
red. 
All psychologists are agreed that sensory con- 
tents are subject to such variations, but there is 
no unanimity of opinion as to what these variable 
phases are. One group of theorists contends that 
all sensations have the same attributes. Another 
maintains that the different fields of sensation 
present quite diverse attributive aspects. The 
theorists of the first group have been largely in- 
fluenced by systematic considerations. The fact 
that sensational contents, so essentially different 
as color and tone, exist simultaneously in the same
-P-A-G-E-84
ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION 65 
consciousness, belonging perhaps to the same object 
of experience, leads them to seek an explanation 
in some common properties of these diverse ele- 
ments. The nature of the attributes which they 
find is, therefore, in some measure predetermined 
by the demands of a systematic explanation. On 
the other hand, those who hold to a strict examina- 
tion of the various classes of sensation as they are 
found, or appear, to be, tend to define a distinct 
group of attributes for each class. 
Without committing ourselves to either of these 
extreme points of view, we shall describe the chief 
attributes of sensation with reference to the tra- 
ditional classification of the first type, pointing 
out the discrepancies of such a classification as 
they are noted in the different groups of sensa- 
tion. 
This traditional classification maintains four 
general attributes of sensation: quality, intensity, 
extensity, and duration. According to the theory 
of this classification, sensation per se is but an un- 
differentiated and indefinite something, when ab- 
stracted from its attributes. That which gives it 
definition is its quality. Qualitative differentiation 
accounts for the diverse fields of sensation, and also 
for the kinds of sensation within a single field. It 
may, therefore, be regarded as the chief among the 
attributes. In addition to its qualitative identity, 
a sensation must have a minimal intensity, exten- 
sity and duration. All three of these can vary 
within limits without altering the quality.
-P-A-G-E-85
66 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
26. Quality 
Let us test this classification by reference to the 
various kinds of sensation which our analysis has 
revealed. From the analytical point of view 
quality is not an attribute of sensation, because 
unqualified sensation is purely hypothetical. What 
our analysis has revealed is elements of sensation 
which are at once qualities. We might, however, 
give to quality a somewhat broader significance 
than we have attached to the element. In the 
case of vision we have described the elements as 
six in number: red, yellow, green, blue, black and 
white. But orange, too, has a quality that is 
stable. Orange resembles red and yellow, but we 
cannot pick out its red and yellow parts by abstrac- 
tive analysis, as we can, for instance, separate the 
partials in a tonal clang. Thus the number of 
qualities of sensation would equal the number of 
homogeneous kinds of experience which can be 
differentiated from all other kinds of experience. 
But an analysis of this sort is not very fruitful, 
since it is practically impossible to establish ade- 
quate standards of measurement for such an inves- 
tigation. Furthermore, when we have secured our 
definite or approximate results, we must rely upon 
the elemental differences which we have already 
found for our description of these numerous quali- 
ties. The true nature of orange is still best 
described by its resemblance to red and yellow, 
even though the experience be a simple one. It
-P-A-G-E-86
ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION 67 
therefore appears that this broader connotation 
which may be given to quality does not assist, but 
rather hinders, analysis. 
We have found features of vision and audition, 
however, that merit some special consideration 
in this connection. These are saturation of visual 
sensation, pitch and tonal, or musical, character, of 
sounds. Each of these possesses a practical sig- 
nificance in the description of the sensations to 
which it applies. The question now before us 
concerns the propriety of regarding them as 
attributes. 
We have found it important to note that a pure 
color or a pure gray varies not alone with reference 
to its brightness, but also with reference to the 
amount of color or grayness which is evident. Yet, 
as we have seen, this fact is not attributable to 
either series when considered by itself, but rather 
to the mixture of elements from the two series. 
The saturation of a color is maximal when it is 
freest from all admixture with black and white. 
Similarly, a black, white or gray is maximal in 
saturation when no evidence of color can be de- 
tected. These variations, therefore, do not add a 
new aspect or attribute to the visual sensations, 
more than do the variations that occur between 
intermediate colors. They arise rather from the 
peculiarly complicated facts of vision, which re- 
quire us to differentiate two reciprocally related 
series. of sensations, the colored and the color- 
less.
-P-A-G-E-87
68 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
With regard to pitch, this is more clearly attrib- 
utive in its nature. Pitch is universally an attri- 
bute of all tones. Our judgment as to highness 
and lowness is uncertain only when a complex of 
tones, or a noise, defies analysis. Even in such 
instances, careful observation will usually detect 
some constituents the pitches of which are assign- 
able to one or another region of the high-low 
series. We are justified, therefore, in regarding 
pitch as a fundamental aspect of all sound-ele- 
ments unless future research should demonstrate 
the existence of elemental noise. Whether or not 
pitch would be universally attributive to noise is 
less certain. 
With the attribute of pitch goes that of mellow- 
ness or shrillness. We have seen that low tones 
are universally mellow, and high tones universally 
shrill. The only question which now arises is that 
of classification. Some authorities describe these 
attributes as spatial. Low tones, they say, are 
big, voluminous; while high tones are small, un; 
extended. Except in the interests of a systematic 
view which attempts to find a spatial attribute in 
every sensation, this description is hardly justifiable. 
The sense of space seems to be derived from those 
classes of sensation involving the direct apprehen- 
sion of two or more simultaneous sensations as 
possessing different local signs. This is not the 
case in sound, unless the two ears codperate in the 
judgment. A color, for instance, is always extended 
in some degree, and has a position in the visual
-P-A-G-E-88
ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION 69 
field. But a tone has no such situation in its own 
tight. Its position in space, when it can be deter- 
mined, is dependent upon extraneous factors, such 
as relative intensity and timbre for different posi- 
tions of the head and ears. We shall hold to 
mellowness and shrillness, therefore, as the more 
accurate terms for describing low and high tones, 
without reference to their exact order in the pitch- 
series. 
The problem of character in tones is more com- 
plicated. A certain tone has a definite pitch, but 
it may have several different characters, according 
to the musical setting in which it occurs. It is 
this setting which is fundamental. The octave 
appears to be an original pattern of tonal experi- 
ence. Whence it is derived we cannot say, but it 
seems as independent of experience as the sense 
of space. It must, then, be reckoned as a perceptual 
form of experience. The attribute of character in 
a tone is, therefore, equivocal, since it not only 
depends upon, but varies with, the musical setting. 
Furthermore, its universality is limited, since very 
high and very low tones do not possess it. A high 
tone is shrill, and its pitch may be determined, but 
it often lacks musical relationship. Noise, if it be 
elemental, evidently lacks this attribute. In the 
complex sounds which we usually term noises, the 
absence of musical affinity is their most striking 
feature. Pitch, as we have seen, is not so difficult 
to detect, and judgments of mellowness and shrill- 
ness are, as a rule, easily made.
-P-A-G-E-89
qo THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
There are no peculiarities of a qualitative order 
which attach to the other classes of sensation, — 
taste, smell and touch. We may, therefore, dis- 
miss the attribute of quality, as unessential to the 
description of our sensational elements. But we 
must retain piich and mellowness-shrillness as true 
attributes of tones. Furthermore, we must recog- 
nize the practical significance of saturation for 
visual sensations and of character in tones, although 
these are not, strictly speaking, attributes of the 
sensory elements in question. 
27. Intensity 
The next common attribute in the traditional 
classification is that of intensity. This attribute 
has universal application in all the fields of sense, 
although it is subject to some special definition 
in that of vision. We must be careful, however, to 
distinguish the attribute-intensity from the inten- 
sity of the physical stimulus. Although the two 
are intimately related, the psychological fact is 
not a direct awareness of the physical fact, as might 
be supposed. Physical intensity is a quantity 
which can be exactly measured. Psychological 
intensity is not. A unit of measurement can, in- 
deed, be applied to psychological intensity, but its 
value is not constant in any strict sense. This 
unit is known as the ‘just noticeable difference’. 
It may be applied to any variation of sensation, 
but we shall consider it here only with reference 
to increase or decrease in intensity.
-P-A-G-E-90
ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION qr 
The reciprocal relationships which exist between 
the intensities of stimuli and their corresponding 
intensities of sensation are expressed in what has 
become known as Weber’s: Law. E. H. Weber, 
a German physiologist who lived in the early part 
of the nineteenth century, discovered that the dis- 
crimination of pressure-intensities was constant if 
the ratios between the weights remained constant. 
Thus, it was just as difficult to discriminate between 
29 and 30 half-ounces, as it was between 29 and 
30 drams, z.¢., 7g ounces. G. T. Fechner (1801- 
1887) carried this discovery over into other fields of 
sensitivity, and expanded Weber’s results into a 
universal law, which may be described as follows: 
If a series of sensations, the intensities of which 
are just noticeable differences, be regarded as con- 
stituting a simple arithmetical series, the corre- 
sponding stimuli will follow a geometrical series. 
The law holds with considerable accuracy for 
intensities that are not extreme, either minimal or 
maximal. 
It is an interesting and important fact that our 
sensations do not directly correspond in intensity 
to the intensities of their stimuli. If this were the 
case our range of experience would be greatly 
decreased. As it is, a certain inertia must be 
overcome before the sensation appears at all, and 
this inertia increases as the force of the stimuli- 
intensities increases. As a consequence of this 
fact we are able to adapt ourselves to both minimal 
and maximal intensities of stimulation, and to
-P-A-G-E-91
72 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
discriminate with the same accuracy for both, 
provided the intensities are not too extreme. Hence, 
it is not the absolute but the relative differences 
which play the leading part in our discrimination 
of intensities. 
For instance, it might be supposed that a 32- 
candle-power incandescent lamp would give twice 
the illumination of a 16-candle-power lamp. But 
this is not the case. We all know that a single 
candle in a dark room gives a certain amount of 
illumination. Two candles give appreciably more 
light, and with each succeeding candle the illumi- 
nation increases. But the rate of increase is a con- 
stantly diminishing factor, for the addition of a 
lighted candle to daylight illumination affords no 
appreciable increment. 
These psychophysical measurements have pro- 
vided a large field for experimental work, but the 
results have not substantiated Fechner’s assump- 
tion of a reciprocal relationship between mind 
and body that permits of universal quantitative 
expression. In the first place, the just noticeable 
difference is not a real increment, since it varies 
in different parts of the intensive scale. Further- 
more, it is subject to individual variation. The 
same individual. does not always get the same 
results, and different individuals get quite dif- 
ferent results. Again, the law assumes that when 
the stimulus is increased by whatever amount, 
the sensation must be increased, whether we can 
detect it or not. But this has not been definitely
-P-A-G-E-92
ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION 73 
proved. So far as it holds, the law is now com- 
monly regarded as the expression of a physiological 
fact, and not as an adequate means for describing 
the relations of mind and body. 
We noted at the beginning of this section that 
some special definition was necessary in order to 
make the attribute of intensity applicable to visual 
sensations. The physical intensity of light cor- 
relates with the degree of brightness. Variations 
from dark to light, therefore, constitute the inten- 
sive attribute of the visual elements. But we 
must note carefully the distinction of brightness- 
variation from the colored and colorless sensations 
to which this applies. We have seen that the pure 
or saturated color exists at a certain medium degree 
of brightness. Its saturation decreases not only 
when it is noticeably brightened or darkened, but 
also when it is mixed with elements of the black- 
white series. We have also seen that a black, gray 
or white may retain its elemental character even 
though it be subjected to considerable variation 
in brightness, as indicated in our illustration of 
the ‘white’ snow and ‘gray’ sky of winter, when 
in point of fact the sky is brighter than the 
snow. 
The correlation of brightness-intensity with the 
colorless series is further complicated by the fact 
that sensations of gray are produced either cen- 
trally or in the retina at times when all physical 
light-stimuli have been eliminated. If we adapt 
our eyes to a completely darkened room, we do
-P-A-G-E-93
74 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
not see black in its purest form, but an expanse 
which is distinctly grayish. Physical intensity 
of the light-wave is therefore not the only correlate 
of psychological intensity, since the gray of the 
dark room is a positive and vivid sensation. But 
it is a necessary correlate for establishing rel- 
ative degrees of brightness, and in the main it 
corresponds closely to the variations of the 
black-white series. 
28. Extensity 
Our third general attribute is extensity. Here 
it is more difficult to establish a universal appli- 
cation. Sensations of vision and touch are ex- 
tended. No matter how small they may be, they 
never lose their extensive aspect. But this aspect, 
as we have seen, does not apply to sounds, neither 
has it an unequivocal significance for taste and 
smell. 
But extensity in these two senses involves some- 
thing more than the mere ‘spreadoutness’ of the 
element. It has alsoa locality. This is commonly 
known as the local sign of the sensation. 
The doctrine of the local sign, as we shall treat 
it, consists simply in the attribution of a more or 
less definite location to the sensations of vision and 
touch. It has no significance as applied to hearing, 
unless difference in local signs be attributed to the two 
ears, and it is apparently of negligible importance in 
the remaining senses save, possibly, kinesthesis. 
For touch and vision, however. which are pecul-
-P-A-G-E-94
ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION 75 
iarly adapted to give us knowledge concerning 
space, an attributive factor is involved in each 
sensation which serves as a basis for its loca- 
tion on the skin or in the visual field. The sig- 
nificance of this fact will be made clear when we 
discuss the perception of space. For the present, 
we need only say that two elements from one of 
these fields of sensation, when possessed of different 
local signatures, suffice to give us the basis for a 
spatial judgment. 
29. Duration 
The last general attribute is duration, and it 
has universal application in all departments of 
sensation. Our estimates of time are made on 
the basis of this attribute, but these are all so 
largely dependent upon perceptual complications 
that we can say little more of duration as an attri- 
bute of sensation than that it exists. Not all the 
senses are of equal importance as a basis for time 
estimates: the auditory, the kinesthetic and the 
tactual sensations appear as the most important 
in this regard. This, however, indicates only that 
these senses are more frequently involved in 
experiences where time as such is important. 
30. Effects of Duration and Repetition, Practice 
and Fatigue 
Before concluding this chapter on the attributes of 
sensation, we shall devote a section to the considera-
-P-A-G-E-95
76 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
tion of certain important facts directly concerned 
with the attributive phases of sensation. 
The duration of a stimulus has important effects 
upon the nature and intensity of the sensation. 
In the first place, there is a certain latent time, 
in which the stimulus must be operative before 
any consciousness results. The inertia of the 
nervous process must be overcome before the 
sensation appears. Gradually, thereafter, it rises 
to the maximal intensity, which requires another 
interval of time. After the maximal intensity is 
achieved, a gradual decrease sets in which is at- 
tributable to fatigue. When the stimulus ceases, 
this decrease becomes more rapid, but the sensa- 
tion continues for an appreciable length of time 
before disappearing. 
In the case of brief but intensive stimuli, we 
find, instead of the simple rise and fall of the 
sensation, a tendency to oscillation, — appearance 
and disappearance, with gradually decreasing in- 
tensity. We have noted the continuance of sen- 
sation after the cessation of the stimulus in the 
visual after-images. The succession of positive and 
negative images, or the ‘flight of colors’, is an in-~ 
stance of the oscillation here described. These 
facts indicate that when the inertia of the nerve 
is once overcome, the process which is set up con~ 
tinues for some time after the stimulus has ceased. 
This is evident in the after-images’ which we have 
noted, but there are also grounds for supposing that 
it continues even after the sensation has ceased.
-P-A-G-E-96
ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION a7 
We shall return to this fact in our consideration 
of the perseverative tendencies in memory. 
When the stimulus is repeated frequently, the 
latent time is lessened, and the maximal intensity 
is sooner attained. The onset of fatigue is also in 
some degree checked. These are some of the 
chief effects of practice. But practice does not 
eliminate fatigue, and it is not advantageous to 
continue successive repetitions after fatigue is 
evident. The effects of practice are, however, a 
permanent acquisition, despite fatigue. It has been 
often noted that the performance of a practised 
task is more effective at the beginning of a new 
period, after an intervening rest, than it was at 
the close of the last practice-period. 
The inertia of the nervous process is also re- 
sponsible for another effect. When successive 
stimuli are sufficiently rapid so that the latent 
times of the sensations overlap, there results a 
fusion of the sensations into a continuous expe- 
rience. If sectors of black and white are rapidly 
rotated, the two sensations mix to form a uniformly 
gray disk. If a point of light is whirled about in 
the dark, we see a circle of light. It is this fact 
that makes the cinematograph possible, in which 
the variations in the successive pictures are appre- 
hended as movements. Our sense of movement is 
therefore derivable from a succession of discrete 
stimuli, when they follow one another with sufficient 
rapidity to prevent the occurrence of latent time 
between the successive sensations. A certain
-P-A-G-E-97
78 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
speed is requisite, otherwise we have the experience 
of ‘flicker’, in which the fusion is incomplete. 
These general facts are applicable in all the de- 
partments of sense, and they form a foundation 
for the study of the learning-process, adjustment 
to environment, and habituation.

CHAPTER VI I I 
IMAGE, AFFECTION AND THOUGHT 
31. Mental Image 
1. Image and Sensation 
O the division of conscious facts which are 
termed sensations, we must now add another: 
mental images. So far as we have yet been able to 
learn, these are in no essential way different from 
the sensations. The psychophysical distinction of 
the two is based primarily on the fact that the 
images are not dependent on the stimulation of 
a sensory end-organ. Their service, therefore, 
does not consist in affording us presentations from 
the outer world, and from our own bodies, but 
rather in enabling us to revive facts from past 
experience. It is thus apparent that we must 
study the images in connection with their physio- 
logical correlates, and also with reference to 
mental activities involved in the revival of past 
experiences. 
For our immediate purpose of surveying conscious- 
ness with the aim of discovering the elements of 
which it consists, we may confine ourselves to 
a brief discussion of the nature of the mental 
image in the various sensory categories we have 
distinguished. 
The visual images stand forth, in certain ways, 
as the most important among the imaginal ele-
-P-A-G-E-99
80 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
ments. We cannot say that they are universal 
constituents of mental life, for they are, of course, 
entirely absent in the case of the congenitally blind, 
and they do not appear to be of frequent occurrence 
in every individual of normal eyesight. The im- 
portance we claim for them rests, rather, on 
the fact that they indubitably exist, apart from 
any visual sensations which chance also to be 
present. While glancing at an object, it is possible 
to have, at the same time, a visual image which is 
clearly distinct from the visual sensations that 
are present and, so far as one can tell, quite inde- 
pendent of them. 
There is great variation in the character of visual 
images among different persons, and at different 
times for the same person. These variations are 
referable to the attributes of the image, which are 
the same as those for the corresponding sensations. 
It is usual to declare that these attributes of the 
image have a narrower range than when applied 
to the sensation. It is, in general, true that we 
cannot establish the same range of saturation or 
brightness in visual imagery that we can in visual 
sensation. The local sign and duration of the 
image are also less exactly known than in the case 
of sensation. Yet this is largely because of the 
difficulties attaching to all investigations without 
objective control. At times visual images evidence 
degrees of saturation and brightness which render 
them hallucinatory to such an extent that it is 
impossible to distinguish them from sensations.
-P-A-G-E-100
IMAGE, AFFECTION AND THOUGHT 81 
It is also possible for them to possess a very exact 
local signature and a persistence in time which 
render them by these means undistinguishable from 
the sensations. Even among individuals who 
very seldom are conscious of a visual image, there 
appear, occasionally, images possessed of a remark- 
able vividness. It has often been noted that an 
occasion peculiarly conducive to these vivid images 
is afforded in the moments which immediately 
precede sleep. 
Auditory images are often very vivid and in- 
dicate marked variability in all their attributes. 
In the case of taste, however, imagery is usually 
very slight and uncertain. Some individuals can 
imagine tastes with considerable vividness, yet an 
uncertainty still remains from the fact that acces- 
sory sensations and images are usually involved to 
a considerable degree. In imagining the taste of 
beefsteak, for instance, one is prone to visualize 
the meat, and to move the jaws in the act of chew- 
ing. To make the illusion more complete, the 
flow of saliva is slightly stimulated, and the appro- 
priate tactual sensations are suggested and even 
sensed or imagined. The simple taste of the steak, 
which is principally a combination of salt and 
sweet, is found on analysis to be more difficult of 
detection. 
With smell, there is more reason for assuming 
independent images, though here again the expe- 
riences are for most people rare, and may be partly 
or wholly derived from the interpretation of certain
-P-A-G-E-101
82 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
olfactory sensations that are actually present. 
Thus, one can seem to detect in the odor of fresh 
tobacco smoke, or incense, various distinct fra- 
grances which may be summoned forth at will. 
With the class of bodily sensations the existence 
of independent images is also problematic. They 
seem to exist, at least for cutaneous pressure and 
its kinesthetic counterparts, but upon closer 
examination, sensations of a relevant sort are 
almost invariably set up. Consequently, the in- 
dependent existence of these images is hard to 
secure. . 
We conclude, therefore, that although theo- 
retically we may assume the possible existence of 
images corresponding to each class of sensations, 
we are quite certain of independent images, — that 
is, such as have no necessary sensational concomi- 
tant,— only in the case of vision and audition. 
They doubtless exist, however, in the case of smells, 
probably also in tastes and the general group of 
bodily experiences. 
2. Imaginal Types 
Much attention has been given to the classifica~ 
tion of individuals in accordance with their imaginal 
type. The elements most conspicuously involved 
in such classifications are the visual, the auditory 
and the kinesthetic, since these are the classes 
of image which might be expected to appear most 
often in connection with all manner of centrally 
aroused processes, both rational and fanciful.
-P-A-G-E-102
IMAGE, AFFECTION AND THOUGHT 83 
Individuals have been divided accordingly into 
classes which seemed to indicate a predominance 
of visual, auditory or kinesthetic imagery, and 
also into classes of a mixed type, such as visual- 
auditory, visual-kinesthetic and auditory-kines- 
thetic. 
The importance of such classifications has been 
based largely upon the assumption that all centrally 
aroused processes are carried on in imaginal terms. 
Upon this assumption it was clearly a matter of 
great pedagogical value to determine the type of 
imagery which an individual used most readily 
in order that the educational appeal might be made 
as direct and economical as possible, and also that 
undeveloped capacities of imagery might be trained 
to more efficient service. But since this assumption 
has not proved to be well founded, images being 
frequently only adjuncts of minor importance in 
the centrally aroused processes, the value of such 
classifications is less assured. Furthermore, the 
difficulties of classification are very great, since 
there appears to be no direct correlation between 
the sensory appeal and the capacity for imagery. 
Some individuals find visual sensations much more 
attractive, and more readily apprehended, than 
-auditory or kinesthetic sensations, and yet they 
may be markedly deficient in visual imagery. The 
same disparity between sensations and images of 
a certain type can be found in the other fields of 
sensation. 
The type distinctions constitute, therefore, a
-P-A-G-E-103
84 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
complex problem, which can be worked out effect- 
ively only with reference to the perceptual and 
other synthetic aspects of mind. 
3. Produced and Reproduced Images 
We have noted the dependence of images upon 
previous sensational experience, and the fact that 
they reveal no absolute qualitative difference from 
the sensations. The distinction is a practi- 
cal one, made ordinarily with reference to the 
strength or weakness of the attributes which 
the elements possess. We are also greatly aided 
by extraneous facts: the nature of the total situa- 
tion, the problems and directive tendencies that 
are operative, etc. Thus we are usually able to 
distinguish the evanescent and representative 
nature of the image from the more substantial and 
insistent character of the sensation. 
If sensation and image are not clearly separable 
as contents, neither is the distinction of produced 
and reproduced imagery one in which a qualitative 
differentiation is possible. .The difference between 
fancy and memory is synthetic, not analytic, in 
its nature. Imagination is an ideational process, 
and will be considered under that head. As con- 
tents all images of fantasy are of one sort, which 
we may term revived sensations. But the wealth 
of experience which accrues to any man is suffi- 
cient to provide him with imaginal elements for 
the greatest variety of unique and fanciful com- 
binations. Therefore, while it is not possible to
-P-A-G-E-104
IMAGE, AFFECTION: AND THOUGHT 85 
transcend the limits of our sensory experience in 
the creation of imaginative complexes, it is quite 
possible to transcend the facts of perceptual ex- 
perience. This will furnish us with a topic for 
later discussion in its appropriate place. 
4. Summary 
In summary we may say that the images form a 
class of elements closely related to the sensations. 
The fact that they may be experienced simultan- 
eously with sensations of the ‘same class and yet 
without adequate sensory stimuli, enables us to 
make the distinction and refer them to a separate 
group of elements. 
32. Affection 
The third division of mental facts revealed by 
our analysis consists in the elements of affection. 
Not only do we experience sensations and images 
as such, but we are also affected pleasantly or un- 
pleasantly by them. This introduces: a group of 
experiences which on first consideration might 
seem to belong more properly to the attributive 
aspects we have considered. But although it is 
probably true that affection never exists apart from 
mental elements of another sort, yet it cannot be 
adequately reckoned as an attribute of sensational 
and imaginal elements. This is clear when we 
consider that a certain sensation may affect us 
now pleasantly, and again unpleasantly. The ap- 
pearance of the affection is evidently not conditioned
-P-A-G-E-105
86 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
by the character of the sensation, but is contingent 
rather upon mental happenings of a corisiderable 
diversity and complexity. Some psychologists, ac- 
cordingly, hold affections to be integrative result- 
ants of sensational and imaginal complexes, and 
regard them either as elements of a secondary or 
‘higher’ order, or as being entirely derivative in 
nature. The evidence at hand does not suffice to 
make either of these theories quite satisfactory, 
and we shall therefore reckon the affections among 
the elements of consciousness. 
The exact nature of the affectional elements is 
not clearly understood, and what we can say con- 
cerning it is, therefore, tentative. The undisputed 
facts are that some experiences are set in a glow 
which seems to enrich their content, while others 
evince the opposite effect of depletion. Variations 
in the degree of enrichment or depletion are readily 
observed, while many experiences are free of any 
noticeable affective tone. 
By common consent, the most apparent types of 
affective tone are described as pleasantness and un- 
pleasantness. Experiences which are enriched are 
usually described as pleasant, agreeable or joyful, 
while those which are depleted are referred to as 
unpleasant, disagreeable and painful. 
It should be noted that this use of the term 
‘pain’ is distinct from that which we have applied 
to a class of bodily sensations. Bodily pain is 
usually disagreeable, though not universally or 
necessarily so, since the stimulation of pain-spots
-P-A-G-E-106
IMAGE, AFFECTION AND THOUGHT 87 
on the skin may be an interesting or even a 
pleasant experience. Furthermore, it is evident 
that many experiences, which are in a high degree 
unpleasant, involve no sensational pain whatever, 
as in the case of disappointment or sorrow. 
It may not appear that the opposition, pleasure 
— displeasure, is adequate to cover all affectional 
experiences. Indeed, it is plainly inadequate when 
we consider the manifold complications of our 
affective life. In the case of the esthetic appre- 
ciation of a tragedy, for instance, an affective tone 
that is essentially unpleasant may be sublimated 
by an artistic treatment which brings to the whole 
experience a glow of enrichment. Experiences, 
too, which involve interest seem to vary from an 
indifference-point in one direction only, since 
interest has no opposite as a positive affectional 
experience. But these are not simple feelings. 
They involve complicated units of experience 
such as our elemental analysis cannot adequately 
account for. We must, therefore, reserve any de- 
bate upon this issue until we are ready to consider 
the synthetic aspects of affection. At this point 
we shall be content to abide by the generally 
accepted doctrine of the elemental character of 
pleasantness and unpleasantness. 
It appears, then, that all simple affections arise 
from an indifference- or zero-point, from which they 
vary in the two opposite directions of pleasure and 
displeasure. Their attributes are those of inten- 
sity and duration.
-P-A-G-E-107
88 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
We have noted that the distinction of sensation 
and image was psychophysical rather than psychi- 
cal, inasmuch as no certain psychological criteria 
have as yet been found for distinguishing the two. 
The psychophysical criterion refers to the presence 
or absence of adequate sensory stimuli, and the re- 
sultant experience is either original or revived. Affec- 
tions appear to be always original. They attach 
themselves to, and are contingent upon, the present 
content, whatever it may be. Here again we have 
an indication of their dependent nature. In order 
to understand them more fully and exactly, we 
must await, on the one hand, further introspective 
evidence concerning them, and, on the other hand, 
more exact knowledge of their psychophysical 
bearings. 
33. Thought 
Thoughts constitute the fourth and last group 
of conscious elements. Sensations, images and 
affections are not the sole contents which mental 
activity brings together in the complicated fabric 
of experience. These contents also mean some- 
thing, and it is in the analysis of meaning that we 
come upon the thought-content. 
The discovery of this element is recent, and it is 
less well defined than the others. Objections have 
been raised to its acceptance, and its claims are 
not yet fully established. Numerous investiga- 
tions, however, have revealed experiences which 
are not reducible in the ordinary way to the three
-P-A-G-E-108
IMAGE, AFFECTION AND THOUGHT 89 
classes of elements already considered. Many who 
have subjected the meaning-process to an unbiassed 
analysis, both experimentally and theoretically, 
have reached the conclusion that additional con- 
tents, other than those mentioned, are here in- 
volved. We shall take our position with these 
investigators, and attempt to justify the recognition 
of a new element as an essential constituent of the 
experience of meaning. 
In doing this we are fully aware of the provisional 
character of such an attempt. A new conception 
so radical as this wins its way slowly.in any science. 
Since the science of psychology has been able to 
establish its analytic methods with three classes of 
elements, it is only natural that the addition of a 
fourth group should be subjected to careful testing 
and criticism. Yet only in recent years has the 
attempt been made to understand the nature of 
thinking. As a subject of experimentation, the 
field is a new one. We are not justified, therefore, 
in refusing to accept the results of this research 
simply on the grounds that such results have not 
previously been obtained. 
The status of sensation and image is assured, 
because these facts have been obvious from the 
beginning. But the existence of affective states is 
also commonly accepted, although the exact in- 
vestigation of their elements is quite as much a 
problem of the future as is the case with thinking. 
In neither instance are we able as yet to give a 
complete description of the elemental contents in-
-P-A-G-E-109
go THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
volved. Yet to maintain that elements are present 
which are irreducible to sensation and image ap- 
pears to be as well founded in thinking as it is in 
affection. 
The thought-elements may be classified under 
two heads: 1. Notions, and 2. Relations. 
1. Notions 
By notion we understand a content of experience 
that sums up in a nuclear form a series of experi- 
ences which, in extenso, would involve sensations, 
images and affections. In acquiring an under- 
standing of a geometrical proposition, —as, for 
example, that the sum of the interior angles of a 
triangle is equal to two right angles, — one makes 
use of words and diagrams; 7.¢c., of sensational and 
imaginal contents. But once the proposition is 
understood, it is no longer necessary to repeat this 
extended proof in order to know its truth. The 
awareness of meaning may come directly in a 
simple pulsation of thought which embodies the 
essence of the detailed processes from which it 
was derived. It is this essence of a situation, or 
complex mental happening, that we call a notion. 
It may be vague or definite, abstract or concrete. 
Sometimes it is a mere indication that a satis- 
factory result could be obtained. Such intentions, 
as they have been called, may consist merely in 
a consciousness of the direction which a problem 
has set, — as, for instance, one may have in mind 
only a sense of familiarity with the geometrical
-P-A-G-E-110
IMAGE, AFFECTION AND THOUGHT gt 
problem, plus a lead of some sort toward its solu- 
tion. Again, the notion is a definite what. The 
gist of the meaning is known quite apart from 
any tendencies directed toward more extended 
experience. In this case we may know that the 
three angles when reduced to a common base will 
unite to form a straight line, without the conscious- 
ness of any imaginal elements. A concrete notion 
of this sort enables one to have in mind a simul- 
taneous knowledge of the six surfaces of a cube, 
something which could not be imagined singly. 
Notions exist along with sensations, images and 
affections, and thus add the increments of meaning 
which these contents have acquired. But they also 
exist separately in isolation, without the attend- 
ance of relevant contents of another order. It is 
the discovery, under experimental conditions, of 
this fact which has led principally to the differen- 
tiation of the thought-contents as distinct elements, 
although many theoretical psychologists had seen 
the necessity for this distinction even before such 
experiments had been made. 
It has been a principle of psychology for many 
years that the fundamental type of conscious ele- 
ment is the sensation. Thinking has accordingly 
been regarded as consisting chiefly in revived sen- 
sations, or images. Without attempting to deter- 
mine whether or not sensations are the most 
fundamental type of element, we are unable to 
regard their ‘copies’, the images, as the sole, or even 
the most important, contents of thought. We shall
-P-A-G-E-111
g2 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
therefore add the thought-content or notion to the 
classes of elements which our analysis has indicated, 
and regard it as a distinct element of consciousness. 
2. Relations 
But thinking involves another factor beside the 
notion. This is the relation. Relations are not 
contents which exist independently in conscious- 
ness. Yet one content may be related to another in 
either simultaneous or successive experience, and 
such relationship involves a unique fact not ac- 
counted for by the simple existence of the two 
contents in question. 
To distinguish the consciousness of relation from 
the consciousness of content, we may say that rela- 
tions subsist, while contents exist. This means 
that a relation always involves at least two founda- 
tions between which it obtains. These foundations 
may be of very various nature. Sensations, images, 
affections and notions all permit the establishment 
of relations. But in addition, relations may sub- 
sist between attributes. Size, intensity and dura- 
tion are foundations for relationship, as well as 
qualities of color, pictorial fantasies and feelings 
of joy or disgust. 
The classification of relations is not yet fully 
agreed upon, but for the sake of illustration we may 
mention the following five groups as exemplifying 
the facts dealt with: (1) There are relations of 
particularity based upon some peculiarity of a rela- 
tional member. Thus an element or attribute
-P-A-G-E-112
IMAGE, AFFECTION AND THOUGHT 93 
may be set off from the attendant experience by 
some characteristic of uniqueness. (2) There are 
relations of equality, as when two magnitudes of a 
sensory nature are regarded as being the same. 
(3) Similarity is a frequent type of relation, as in 
the comparison of forms. (4) Difference involves a 
multitude of relational types. These vary from 
the simple consciousness of distinction to the more 
precise relations of dependency, such as part to 
whole, subordinate to superordinate, etc. (5) Iden- 
tity, finally, is distinguished from equality, in that 
we deal here with qualitative rather than with 
quantitative likeness. The identity of red is estab- 
lished even when the objects so colored are of very 
different kinds and magnitudes. Various combi- 
nations of these distinctions are likewise possible. 
Partial identity may also involve the peculiarity 
of one member, while equality usually involves 
some element of difference. But it may be said 
that more than one relationship is here estab- 
lished. 
Relations frequently subsist in cases where only 
one of the terms is definite. One may be conscious 
of horse in a subordinate relationship of difference 
before one is conscious of animal as the superior 
term sought. In this case the second term is 
merely indicated as a notion of intention, — a con- 
sciousness of the direction in which the second term 
is to be sought. It is also possible to recall a rela- 
tionship once established without either term being 
given in consciousness. The contrast of extremes,
-P-A-G-E-113
94 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
for example, is a common subject of thought. 
Yet in order to think it, the concrete factors in 
which the relationship originally subsisted need not 
be present. Perhaps the typical experience for this 
relationship is the contrast of black and white, or 
that of a tall and a short person. Yet, although 
their images or their’ verbal counterparts come 
readily to mind when one seeks a concrete founda- 
tion for the relationship in question, they are not 
essential to the thought of contrasting extremes, 
and can be very well dispensed with. In such a 
case as this, however, the relationship is not actually 
Subsistent in consciousness, but really existent as a 
thought-content. It is not the relation itself, but 
a notion of the relationship, which is experienced. 
Thus we see that the notion is the true content 
of the thought-consciousness, when we mean by 
content a separable entity. But notions are 
derived not alone from contents, but also from their 
attributes and relations. Relations, like attributes, 
can occur in their own right only when their founda- 
tions are present. The foundation for an attribute 
is always a separable content of experience, — a 
sensation, image, affection or notion, — while for the 
subsistence of a relation at least two foundations 
are necessary, though these may be attributes as 
well as contents of experience.
-P-A-G-E-114
IMAGE, AFFECTION AND THOUGHT 95 
34. Summary 
This concludes our analysis of consciousness. We 
have found it possible to enumerate and describe 
four groups or categories: sensations, images, 
affections and thoughts. The sensations are con- 
ditioned by external physical stimuli and a cor- 
responding neural process, both of which may be 
defined with some exactness. Sensation, therefore, 
affords us direct information concerning the world in 
which we live, including, of course, our own bodies. 
The psychophysics of the image is not so well 
understood, but the probable condition is that of - 
an inadequate stimulation of the same neural tracts 
or of the same pattern of neural stresses and strains 
that, when originally excited from without the 
central system, produced a sensation. The image 
is therefore sometimes referred to as a ‘centrally 
aroused sensation’. In its characteristics or tex- 
ture, it does not appear to be different from a sen- 
sation. We may therefore consider it as a revived 
sensation. Our knowledge of the conditions which 
occasion the appearance of an affection are even 
more obscure. It is possible to give a hypothetical 
explanation for affection, in terms of the interplay 
of nervous energies in a manner to procure an in- 
crease or decrease in the intensity of the current, 
but such theories are at present entirely conjectural, 
and some authorities go so far as to deny that 
affection has any nervous correlate. The absence 
of detailed information concerning the nervous
-P-A-G-E-115
96 THE ANALYTIC FACTS OF MIND 
process also precludes the possibility of explaining, 
as yet, the psychophysical nature of thought- 
Hence, we must: content ourselves with the fact 
of its existence, until our knowledge of neurology 
is more highly developed. 
1. The Problem of Analysis 
Before concluding this section, it is well to recall 
what we have previously said regarding the possi- 
bility of a more ultimate analysis of consciousness 
than the one we have outlined. The close resem- 
blance of images to sensations has revealed the 
possibility of reducing the former to the latter 
category. Similarly, in the case of affection and 
thought, future investigations may point the way 
to a consideration of these facts as integrations of 
more simple and more truly elemental contents of 
mind. Perhaps we shall find that the sensory 
process is a sufficient basis for all these integrations. 
But for the present, it appears best to describe the 
facts as we have done, and to await a time when 
our knowledge is more complete before we attempt 
to push. our analysis farther back. 
There is one point of systematic importance, 
however, which in view of some of our later con- 
siderations, it may be well for us.to enlarge upon 
here. In the interests of a systematic derivation 
of all experience, we are led to inquire if all experi- 
ence may be attributed directly or indirectly to 
contact with the outer world. If it can be, then
-P-A-G-E-116
IMAGE,. AFFECTION AND THOUGHT 07 
some fundamental element akin to sensation would 
seem to be its natural source. If, however, we are 
led to the conclusion that factors not derived from 
contact with the outer world, but existing prior to 
all external experience, constitute the codperating 
agency of mind, to form and direct mental hap- 
penings, then we shall not find in sensation the 
sole basis of experience. This second alternative 
would tend to seek in the mind itself the origin of 
thoughts and possibly of affections, leaving the sen- 
sations and images to be accounted for by contact 
with the physical universe.

CHAPTER IX 
ATTENTION 
35. Introduction 
E must now undertake the problem of put- 
ting together our elemental facts. It is 
evident that mental happenings are imperfectly 
explained by a mere enumeration of such elements 
as we are able to isolate. Isolation, itself, renders 
a mental content abstract and unreal. It is not 
aggregations of sensations, images, affections and 
thoughts which we experience, but things and 
ideas, emotions and judgments, all existing in a 
complicated temporal order. To make our syn- 
thesis possible, and regain our concrete mental 
happenings from the elements which we have 
analyzed, it is necessary that we should now in- 
vestigate a group of facts pertaining to mental 
activity and physiological process. 
36. The Characteristic Fact of Attention 
The first of these synthetic facts to be con- 
sidered is that of attention. There is nothing that 
differentiates mental and physical happenings in a 
more striking manner than the fact of attention. 
Physical forces operate together under the law of 
the resultant, which is illustrated most simply by 
the parallelogram of forces. In a word, the result- 
ant is merely the aggregate of the various forces
-P-A-G-E-121
102 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND: 
applied at a given point. The mental happenings 
of any moment are likewise a resultant of many 
forces, but the dominant fact is not always the one 
which a simple study of the physical conditions 
enables us to predict. The mental processes 
operate here with a determining tendency best: de- 
scribed as purposive, whether or not we shall 
in the future be able to reduce it to a physical 
basis. 
Other things being equal, of two sensory stimuli 
the more intensive will be the more effectual. 
But the ‘other things’ are not often equal, and 
consequently, the moderate light-waves reflected 
from a printed page may engross us, despite the 
roaring of a tempest in our ears. 
This is the characteristic fact of attention: the 
vividness or clearness attaching to a certain event 
in experience among a multitude of other events 
which are all clamoring more or less for recog- 
nition. Some degree of clearness is always attrib- 
utable to an experience, whatever its nature, but 
the problem of establishing the relative degrees of 
clearness attaching to the various elements of a 
complex is not an easy one. In the first place, 
experience is never simple, for, as already pointed 
out, its elements are not concrete events which can 
at once be distinguished in the aggregate whole. 
Full attention is possible only at the final stage 
of presentation, that is, after the event has been 
established in consciousness. It is then a unit 
of experience, but at the same time subject to
-P-A-G-E-122
ATTENTION 103 
analysis. Thus, a narrower view may reveal a 
shifting clearness among the details of the event. 
In a general way, it is usually possible to distin- 
guish one thing as focal and therefore relatively 
clear, as compared with numerous other things 
which are non-focal and unclear. 
An analogous condition prevails in the field of 
vision, where it is determined largely by conditions 
of retinal sensitivity; but the concreteness of the 
case makes this a rather satisfactory illustration. 
A certain central area in each retina is more highly © 
sensitive than the surrounding areas. This causes 
us to focus the eyes in such a manner that direct 
vision is secured for objects falling within these 
areas. Such objects are distinct, as compared with 
those projected upon the outlying portions of the 
retin, which are indistinct. 
The conditions which determine attention, how- 
ever, are not in the first instance sensory, as regards 
the case of vision just noted. We are not nec- 
essarily attentive to objects that fall within the 
range of direct vision, though such objects naturally 
call our attention. We can also attend to objects 
in indirect vision, as when, for purposes of psy- 
chological analysis, we desire to study the nature 
of the indirect visual field. In the case of moving 
objects, furthermore, an impression in the indirect 
field is more effective than one in the direct field, 
causing us to turn our eyes involuntarily to bring 
the object in question into focus.
-P-A-G-E-123
104 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
37. The Mental Act of Attention 
The direction of attention in a purely sensory 
manner may be occasioned in three different ways: 
(x) By the sudden increase or decrease in intensity 
of a sensation already present in consciousness; (2) 
By the sudden cessation of a sensation which has 
been present but unattended to — as, for instance, 
when a monotonous sound, like the ticking of a 
clock, is suddenly withdrawn; (3) By the sudden 
appearance of something new, which by reason of 
its intensity, extensity, endurance, movement or 
qualitative peculiarity is forced into the focus of 
experience. 
Cases such as the above are known as involun- 
tary attention. Yet these are but the relatively 
infrequent distractions which interrupt our normal 
mental processes. As we have already noted in 
Part I, consciousness varies through the stages of 
the simple presentation and awareness of an object 
to its complete establishment as a unified fact of 
experience. The first stage is one of inattention, 
since no single fact is more prominent than another. 
In the second stage, some degree of clearness at- 
taches to the object of which we are aware. It is 
singled out from among the others that are pres- 
ent. At the final stage it is clearly attended to as 
a definite unit, although this unit is not a simple 
but a complex fact of experience. A selective pur- 
pose is now operative in directing the attention 
upon facts which may, in themselves, possess none
-P-A-G-E-124
ATTENTION 105 
of the striking characteristics of uniqueness or in- 
tensity which we found to be the occasion of sen- 
sory attention. It is this selective purpose that 
makes possible the absorption of thought in matters 
the sensory contents of which are of the most 
uniformly monotonous character. Thus, we may 
read, or write, or think, for hours at a stretch, with 
little or no distraction from attendant sensations. 
But preparation for attention does not neces- 
sarily involve a conscious expectancy. The selec- 
tive purpose also operates unconsciously. We are 
often prepared to give full attention to objects 
that are not anticipated. The consciousness of 
the situation or problem before us need not be 
explicit as to the occurrence which it is directing. 
This state of readiness conditions an enhanced 
sensitivity, causing a relevant sensation to appear 
more intense than it otherwise would. This is 
most clearly evident in the case of tones. But 
the question whether such enhancement is due to 
a real intensive increase, or only to a greater degree 
of clearness, is still a matter of dispute. In any 
event, the fact is referable to the act of attention 
and not to a mere variation in the attributes of 
sensation. Attributive variation may be the basis 
for discrimination, but the acé of discriminating 
must take place before such a discrimination can 
be made. 
The consciousness attaching to this act of the 
attention is usually described as interest. We 
are interested when we attend. The mental ac-
-P-A-G-E-125
106 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
tivity which makes attention possible is fundamen- 
tal to this experience. But interest is not merely 
a conscious act of mind. It has also an affective 
side, which is usually pleasant. We shall refer 
again to this phase of interest in our chapter on the 
emotional experiences. 
38. The Fluctuations of Attention 
One thing further must be emphasized: — the 
attention is never at a standstill. The things to 
which we attend, and which have the peculiar 
clearness due to purposive control, are constantly 
shifting. Be it sensation, image or thought to 
which we attend, it must constantly change, or 
be submerged. Attention to simple sensory and 
imaginal constructs is accordingly very brief. 
When these constructs are more complex, the 
attention may have opportunity to wander over 
the various component parts. But it is in the 
process of thinking that the attention has its 
widest scope, and may therefore adhere the longest 
to a unified construct. 
An explanation of the fluctuations of attention 
is partly to be sought in the nature of the attentive 
act itself. It is an essential characteristic of this 
activity that new material is constantly being pre- 
sented. When the material becomes uniform and 
monotonous, interest flags. This is but an indica- 
tion that the activity involved in clear presentation 
is ceasing. But there are also physical causes which 
contribute to such fluctuations. The fatigue of
-P-A-G-E-126
ATTENTION ‘ 1o7 
the sense-organ is the most conspicuous among 
these. Not only is it impossible to maintain the 
act of attention when the sensory material remains 
the same, but the sensations show marked altera- 
tions in quality and intensity when they are con- 
tinued without interruption or variation. Hence, 
fluctuations in attention are a combined result of 
a variation in the nature of the mental activity and 
a variation in the nature of the sensation or other | 
content to which attention is being given. 
39. Summary 
To review briefly what has been said, it appears 
that consciousness may vary from a state in which 
an aggregate of events is simply presented, to one 
in which these events are highly organized about a 
central focus. It is in this last state that attention 
is manifest in the highest degree. It may be con- 
ditioned in either of two ways, or by the joint 
operation of both. The one set of conditions is 
purely physical, while the other is, so far as our 
knowledge now extends, mental. In either case, 
the conscious result is an attributive clearness 
which attaches to the fact or facts occupying the 
focus of the experience, and the state of mind is 
the one described as interest. We have indicated 
the physical conditions for this organization of 
experiences as due to intensity or difference in 
the conscious events attended to. We have referred 
more vaguely to the mental conditions as those 
involved in conscious purpose. Except that we
-P-A-G-E-127
108 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
may recall our introductory remarks. concerning 
the problems and directive tendencies which are 
operative in all conscious adjustments, it will not 
be advisable for us to pursue the discussion and ex- 
planation of these mental acts until we have before 
us further data concerning mental syntheses.
-P-A-G-E-128
CHAPTER X 
MEMORY 
40. Revived Sensory Experience 
HE next fact in synthesizing our mental ele- 
ments which calls for consideration is that of 
memory. We have already touched upon this in 
our description of the mental image. The image is 
essentially a revived sensation, and therefore pre- 
supposes memory for its existence. A theory of 
memory may be constructed in which this alone is 
taken into consideration. But sucha theory fails to 
explain the appearance of thought-elements and the 
conscious directions evidenced in our mental hap- 
penings. It may be well, however, to consider this 
theory first, because so far as it goes it is quite 
satisfactory, and we shall then need only to extend 
it in order to understand the wider-reaching conse- 
quences involved in reasoning. 
Confining ourselves, then, for the time to sensory 
experience, we find that every sense-impression 
leaves us predisposed to the revival of that experi- 
ence. We note this in two ways: first, in the re- 
currence or reproduction of the experience as an 
image; and, second, in the recognition which may 
attach to the sense-impression when it is renewed. 
Both these facts are doubtless based upon, though 
perhaps not fully explained by, physical conditions 
in the organism. The assumption seems to be
-P-A-G-E-129
IIo THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
‘warranted that every sense-impression modifies 
the nervous structures in some manner, although 
we are at present unable to explain how. These 
modifications are the occasion for two tendencies 
of revival. The first is known as the reproductive 
tendency, and indicates the readiness of the impres- 
sion to be aroused again when a suitable motive is 
afforded. The second is known as the perseverative 
tendency, and indicates a certain vivacity which 
the impression possesses in its own right, thus en- 
abling it to endure for a time, usually rather brief, 
and to revive itself occasionally without the assist- 
ance of a conscious motive for reproduction.: 
1. The Reproductive Tendency 
The reproductive tendency has a basis which is 
possessed of a high degree of permanence. This 
accounts for the common opinion that nothing is 
ever entirely forgotten. This statement is not fully 
justified by the facts in the case. Experiments 
show that all impressions fade with time, if they 
are not repeated. During the first few hours they 
sometimes lose ground with great rapidity, but after 
a day, they no longer continue to fade at the same 
rate, and as time goes on the increase in loss of 
capacity for reproduction is reduced to a minimum. 
Thus, some trace of the original impression may 
be detected in the speed of relearning long 
after it has become impossible to reproduce the 
image or to recognize a renewal of the sense- 
impression.
-P-A-G-E-130
MEMORY Tit 
2. The Perseverative Tendency 
The perseverative tendency appears to rest upon 
the fact that the organic basis of memory is not 
merely a plasticity of the nervous structures which 
enables them to retain lasting impressions, but 
also an elasticity —if we may use this term in 
a purely analogical manner. That is to say, the 
organic process continues to be active for some time 
after the impression has ceased, and may manifest 
itself by a recurrence of the image from time to 
time, when the attention is not closely directed upon 
other matters. This, as we have noted in § 30, is 
based upon the zmertia of nervous processes. A 
familiar illustration is found in the popular melo- 
dies which take possession of us, and run in our 
heads for days whenever an odd moment of inat- 
tention occurs. As they are repeated these airs 
constantly acquire new vigor and vivacity for their 
next appearance. 
41. The Conditions of the Memory-Tendencies 
There are three principal conditions which gov- 
ern these memory-tendencies: (1) Intensity, (2) 
Recency, and (3) Frequency. 
1. Intensity 
The intensity of the impression is due to various 
causes. We have, first, the intensity of the stimulus 
which plays its part in producing a lasting and vi- 
vacious impression. But the attention also plays
-P-A-G-E-131
112 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND , 
its réle, as we have seen, independent of the inten- 
sity of the stimulus. Consequently, we have, sec- 
ond, the degree of clearness which attaches to the 
sense-impression, as a condition of effective mem- 
ory. Third, it appears that affection (pleasant~ 
ness and unpleasantness), when aroused with a 
sense-impression, is favorable to its endurance and 
vivacity. 
2. Recency 
It is sufficiently evident from what has already 
been said regarding the basis of the reproductive 
and perseverative tendencies that, other things 
being equal, a recent impression will possess more 
active tendencies for revival than an impression of 
an earlier date. 
3. Frequency 
It is also clear that the more frequently an im- 
pression is repeated, the stronger these tendencies 
will become. 
The three conditions enumerated interplay freely 
in determining a particular revival. Thus, inten- 
sity may prove ih a specific instance to be more 
powerful than recency or frequency, and again, 
recency or frequency may dominate the remaining 
two conditions. One special instance is worthy 
of note. It appears that of two impressions of 
different age, other conditions being equal, the older 
tendency is sometimes more effective than the newer 
one. We find an exaggerated illustration of this in 
old age forgetfulness, where recent impressions fail
-P-A-G-E-132
MEMORY 113 
to acquire their normal force, and the individual 
dwells, as we say, in the past. 
One further fact is to be noted regarding the basis 
for reproductive and perseverative tendencies: 
namely, that a certain period of time appears 
requisite for any sense-impression to become set 
before the tendencies mentioned can appear. This 
means that if a certain impression is interrupted 
in its course or immediately superseded by another 
impression which dominates consciousness, the 
tag-ends, at least, of the preceding impression fail 
to take hold, and no tendencies of revival are es- 
tablished by them. This is known as retroactive 
amnesia, and is manifest when one turns the atten- 
tion abruptly from one matter to another, dissimilar, 
matter. The organization of the first matter seems 
to be interfered with in such cases, and as a result 
parts may be lost irretrievably. The same thing 
is noted when an impression is interrupted by a 
shock of some sort which throws the mind into 
a state of confusion or unconsciousness. 
From this we can draw the practical conclusion 
that it is unwise, when attempting to impress the 
mind with different subjects which are unrelated, 
to turn the attention abruptly from one to the other. 
The impressions will be more effective if a brief 
pause of from three to five minutes is allowed be- 
tween the impressions of unrelated subjects. We also 
learn from this fact the reason for the forgetfulness 
attaching to the moments which immediately pre- 
cede an accident, often making it impossible for the
-P-A-G-E-133
  Il4 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
person concerned to ‘know what struck him’, and 
also frequently rendering the testimony of witnesses 
to such an event unreliable. 
42. Association 
Let us turn now to the problem of motivation 
_ in memory. The facts which hinge most closely 
upon the revival of discrete sensory impressions 
are those commonly described as associations. 
Association refers simply to the means by which 
a previously established reproductive tendency 
is made effective without a complete reinstate- 
ment of the original impression. This appears to 
be occasioned in two ways: Either some portion 
of the original impression recurs and is effective 
in motivating the reproductive tendencies of other 
portions of the original experience which were 
contiguous to it in space or time, or some sim-~ 
ilar or analogous impression is effective in a like 
manner. 
1. Contiguity 
Regarding the first form of association, which is 
described as association by contiguity, we have no 
sufficient facts at our command for carrying through 
an explanation in terms of the physiological basis 
of memory. It is probable, however, that the basis 
of memory in these cases is a functional pattern of 
some sort, produced by the stresses and strains of 
the original impression in the nervous system, and 
when a portion of the pattern is set again in opera-
-P-A-G-E-134
MEMORY : 11g 
tion, the whole, or, at least, the dominant remain- 
ing portions of the process, tend to be reproduced 
as a result of the previous organized impression. 
2. Similarity 
With reference to association by similarity, or 
analogy, it is more probable that we transcend the 
limitation of a simple and automatic procedure. 
Instead of identical part-correspondence as a means 
for actuating reproductive tendencies, we are con- 
fronted by a situation in which an analogical rela- 
tionship is established between a present and a 
past experience never before connected. We have 
described the relation as an element of thought, 
which is not immediately derivable from sensory 
experience, but is a result rather of the productive 
or creative activity of the mind. Such analogies 
at times are established between contents which 
are totally different in their sensory character- 
istics, as, for instance, in the classical illustration 
of Newton’s analogy between the heavenly bodies 
falling through space, and the falling of the apple 
to the ground. On the other hand, simple rela- 
tions of similarity are established between complex 
sensory impressions by means of a common com- 
ponent. Thus, a gown of a certain scarlet color 
might recall a flower of the same color. Such 
cases are not essentially different from those of 
contiguity where the association is based upon an 
identical link.
-P-A-G-E-135
116 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
This fact has led some psychologists to argue 
that association by similarity is but a case of asso- 
ciation by contiguity. They contend that some 
partial identity is always demonstrable whenever 
an association is effected. ‘The whole question 
reduces itself to one of fact: — namely, are our 
experiences completely accounted for in terms 
of sensory association of partial identity? We 
have already answered this question negatively 
in Part I, by insisting that the collocation of 
mental events was not purely a mechanical aggre- 
gation, but one which manifests the direction of 
an active subject exercising a monarchical super- 
vision over his experience. If we accept this view, 
it becomes necessary to subordinate the reproduc- 
tive and perseverative tendencies to the more 
powerful activity of the directive tendencies. 
This leads us to the conclusion that neither 
partial nor complete identity of present impres- 
sion with past experience is a full explanation for 
revival. We may even question whether any such 
identity exists in an absolute sense. The logic 
of identity which permits us to bring organiza~ 
tion into the chaos of sensory experience is a logic 
of meaning rather than one of sensory content. 
We have no guarantee that any sensory content 
is ever repeated exactly; on the contrary, we have 
much evidence for believing that change is the more 
fundamental law of events. Let us therefore con- 
sider the case as follows: — Every sensory impres- 
sion leaves a perseverative tendency, by means
-P-A-G-E-136
MEMORY 117 
of which the experience may be revived more or 
less as it was originally experienced without asso- 
ciative connection. It also leaves a reproductive 
tendency which is actuated by some conscious 
motive for revival. This motive may appear as 
a-sensation-, image-, or thought-content which is 
partially identical with or analogous to the orig- 
inal experience. Furthermore, it is under the mon- 
archical supervision of the problem before us, 
and the directions which the problem gives. 
It is only in certain instances of disorganized 
consciousness, as in the state of drowsiness or dis- 
traction, and their abnormal counterparts among 
the insane who suffer from the ‘flight of ideas’, that 
we find the mechanical operations of sheer asso- 
ciation dominant. These are known as ‘free’ 
associations, since they are not subject to the 
supervision and control of a definite task. 
3. The ‘Free Association’ Method 
A method has been devised for the experimental 
investigation of these simple and more or less 
mechanical operations of association, which is 
known as the ‘free association’, method. This 
consists in presenting to the observer a series of 
simple words, orally or visually, with the general 
instruction that each word be paired with the first 
word which comes to mind after it is presented. 
The reaction-word which the observer supplies is 
immediately uttered, or its presence is indicated 
by some direct means, and the reaction-time is
-P-A-G-E-137
118 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
carefully noted by the experimenter. It is found 
that normal reactions of this type usually con- 
sume less than one second in time, and in a long 
series the variation is not great. But certain 
exceptions will appear in which the reaction is 
noticeably delayed. 
The study of such a series of paired words, cor- 
related with their respective reaction-times, and 
also, if possible, with the observer’s introspective 
account as to what happened in each case, has 
proven a very valuable source of information re- 
garding associative connections. In the reactions 
of normal length, the reproductive tendency is seen 
to operate in the majority of cases to bring to con~ 
sciousness words which have been contiguous with, 
or which are similar to, the stimulus-words. Oc- 
casionally, there appears a word in which such an 
associative connection cannot be traced. These 
are usually the result of a perseverative tendency 
which, as we have seen, provides for the recurrence 
in consciousness of experiences that have pos- 
sessed a peculiar liveliness in their impression. 
They are therefore reproduced without the pres- 
ence of an adequate associative motive. 
In the case of the delayed reactions, we find that 
the mechanically direct operation of reproductive 
and perseverative tendencies is hindered by the 
injection of a directive tendency, or by a conscious 
conflict of tendencies. Anything that arouses our 
interest will tend to interfere with the mechani- 
cal course of association. For this reason, the
-P-A-G-E-138
MEMORY 119 
method has a practical significance and may be 
used for the purpose of analyzing complexes which 
the observer, consciously or unconsciously, keeps 
back. For instance, it has been used with con- 
siderable success in the detection of crime. Into a 
list of words which may be expected to occasion 
only indifferent and mechanical associative re- 
sponses, there is introduced a number of words 
possessing an intimate significance for the one 
who committed the crime. These words must, 
of course, be selected with great care, so that they 
will arouse interest in the perpetrator of the deed, 
and will be of indifference to all others. If this 
can be done, the reactions for these words will be 
delayed in the case of the criminal, but not in the 
case of an innocent person. 
The method is also used in analyzing the mental 
happenings of individuals who suffer from aberra- 
tions traceable to certain emotional ‘complexes’, 
which dominate their lives and make their behavior 
irrational. The delayed reactions often indicate 
the presence of these emotional complexes, and the 
significance which can be attributed to the word 
and its associate will sometimes reveal the na- 
ture of the complex, and suggest a means of 
overcoming its baneful influence. We shall re- 
turn to this matter when we discuss the topic 
of Insanity. 
Thus we find in the partial identities and habitual 
relationships of the ‘free’ associations, indications 
of the mechanism of revival in its purest and most
-P-A-G-E-139
120 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
unrestrained form. But whenever the attentive 
mind is operating with problems and directions of 
a purposive character, the associative mechanism 
is subordinated to a lower rank, where it affords, in 
accordance with its abilities, the data for selec- 
tion and rejection upon which the purposive mind 
operates. To be sure, the sheer strength of an 
associative bond often brings to consciousness 
images, relations and even thoughts that are 
quite irrelevant to the proceedings at hand. But, 
if the problem and directive tendencies have suf- 
ficient strength, these are suppressed and dismissed. ~ 
When this is not the case, we have an instance of 
distraction, and the mind may then take up the 
new content as a basis for further determinations 
and for sequential expression. 
4. Conclusion 
Thus we see that our associative memory, as 
important as it is in furnishing us with the relevant 
material for mental operations, is not a complete 
account of all that is stored in our minds and sub- 
ject to revival. In addition, we must consider 
those mental products called thoughts: — namely, 
the relations and notions which are the results 
of organized experience having as their basis not 
merely the sensory content, but also the aim 
of the subject in effecting these organizations. 
The results are notions, which contain the nu- 
clear essence of many experiences; and relations, 
which subsist between the contents, -— sensory,
-P-A-G-E-140
MEMORY I2r 
imaginal and notional, —to effect that unity and 
coherence characteristic of mental happenings. - 
These thought-elements, while they may be as- 
sociated among themselves and with the sensa- 
tions and images, are subject to directive guidance 
in a manner in which the sensations and images 
are not. We seem, therefore, to find two levels 
of reproductive activity in our minds: A lower 
level, which is essentially that of association by 
contiguity; and a higher level, in which a directive 
tendency occasions, primarily, the appearance of 
notions and relations relevant to the problem at 
hand, and, secondarily, the reappearance of images 
associatively connected with the situation. 
43. The Process of Remembering 
The process of remembering involves three dis- 
tinct phases: The first is the presentation of the 
material to be memorized. This may be merely 
noted, or it may be repeated and learned. Second, 
the material is retained through modifications of 
the nervous structures involved, either because of 
their plasticity, which conditions a lasting impres- 
sion, or by virtue of their elasticity, which makes 
possible a continuance of the nervous process after 
consciousness has ceased. These after-effects are 
subject to the individual variations which we note 
in the ordinary distinction between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ 
memories. ‘The third phase is that of re-presen- 
tation, and it, in turn, involves three forms of 
reappearance.

The first of these is the simple reproduction of 
sensations in imaginal form. (We have already 
noted that the affections are not reproduced, 
but are always actwal, that is, original, experiences.) 
The second form dispenses with the image, and pro- 
duces a notion of the original content. Thus, we 
think about what we have experienced and in no- 
tional form revive sensations, images and affections 
or their attributes and relations. Although I can- 
not revive a pleasure that is past, I can very well 
think about it, in which case I am conscious of its 
essence or meaning. The third form of re-presen- 
tation is a complete re-living of the former experi- 
ence. In this case, the images are reproduced, 
with their meanings and affections, in a more or 
less adequate revival of the whole situation. 
All three of these forms of re-presentation may 
be experienced with or without the consciousness 
of relationship to the past. When this relationship 
is established, we speak of recollection. Retention 
is the basis for all re-presentations, whether recol- 
lected or not, but it continues to exist even when 
no conscious evidence of it is present. 
Recollection also involves recognition, and we 
shall devote a special section to the consideration 
of this experience. 
44. Recognition 
1. Dependence on Problem and Direction 
It is usual to say that a memory or revived ex- , 
perience is known as such by reason of the fact that
-P-A-G-E-142
MEMORY 123 
we recognize it. Since it is not true that all re- 
vived experiences are recognized, nor even that all 
recognized experiences are those which have been 
revived, recognition cannot be described as an in- 
variable attribute of reproduced elements. The 
reason for this is to be sought in the nature of 
the distinction between the produced and repro- 
duced contents of experience. The essential dif- 
ference between these does not appear to lie in 
any definite peculiarity of a content of fantasy, 
as compared with a content of memory. Just as 
we have found no grounds for setting off sensa- 
tions as intrinsically different from images, so we 
find that fantasies are not, as such, clearly dis- 
tinguishable from memories. In both cases, it is 
largely the problem before us with its directive 
tendencies upon which the practical distinction 
rests. This does not mean, of course, that it is an 
arbitrary matter whether a certain conscious occur- 
rence be recognized or not, but it does mean that 
we are set for memories or fancies in advance, 
and that the selection of the revived images, 
notions and relations is made in accordance with 
this direction. Thus, it may happen that one di- 
rected toward memory-contents fails to detect the 
appearance of something which is in reality new 
and never before experienced; or, that one directed 
toward fantasy fails to recognize old and oft-re- 
peated happenings. But although recognition is re- 
sponsive not merely to the nature of a content as 
revived or new, but also in large measure to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
124 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
attitude which the problem at hand and its directive 
tendencies occasion, it is not without practical 
significance in its evaluation of the situation as a 
whole. As such it is, indeed, highly trustworthy, 
and in its very failures to detect with accuracy 
phases of an experience as new or old, it only 
reminds us that mental happenings are always 
complex, and that their primal significance always 
attaches to the whole process and not to the parts, 
whatever their origin may be. 
From one point of view, all conscious facts as 
elements are old. That is, with reference to sensa- 
tional experience the individual runs the gamut 
of his sensational capacities in infancy, and all that 
he can experience thereafter is but a renewal of 
these facts. From another point of view, however, 
experience is always new; new relations and new 
‘notions are constantly being formed; the selective 
agency of mind never permits us to live again with 
exactness any moment which has passed. Hence, 
it is not with reference solely to the elements of our 
experience that we determine their identity and 
difference, but more largely with respect to their 
meaning for us in any concrete instance. 
2. Recognition as Affection and Thought 
Recognition, as applied to the total situation, 
expresses this meaning, and we must now consider 
what it is in itself. It has been customary to 
regard it essentially as a feeling of ‘at-homeness’ 
which attaches to the old, as compared to an oppo-
-P-A-G-E-144
MEMORY 125 
site feeling of surprise and strangeness which 
attaches to the new. These affective tones are 
then analyzed into pleasantness and unpleasantness, 
respectively. Without raising immediately the 
question as to why an old experience should be 
invariably pleasant and a new one invariably un- 
pleasant, we may first question the facts of the 
case. Evidently, they do not justify this conclu- 
sion in the mature mind of man, though there may 
be some grounds for the assumption that a genetic 
truth is here involved. It is well known that 
animals, in the main, appear to favor the customary 
and avoid the strange in their adjustments. But 
this, of course, does not prove that feelings of 
pleasantness and unpleasantness attach to the two 
sorts of situation. We are therefore thrown back 
upon human experience for our interpretation. 
This does not justify us in assuming that even in 
its most primitive stages any such invariable corre- 
lation of pleasantness and unpleasantness with the 
old and the new is to be found. On the contrary, 
the new has far greater possibilities of affectional 
enrichment than has the old. Were it not for 
this, we should be at a loss to explain the 
spirit of adventure, which appears even in ani- 
mal life to provoke those modifications in 
adjustment without which no evolution would be 
possible. 
Not only does pleasantness often attach to the 
new, but unpleasantness frequently attends the 
old in experience. It is the frequent repetitions,
-P-A-G-E-145
126 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
the monotonous sameness of things, which pro- 
voke ennui and distaste for life. Consequently, 
it appears that if we are to regard recognition as 
essentially an affection, we must demand some 
‘higher’ order of affection than that afforded by the 
opposition of pleasantness and unpleasantness. 
But if we can account for recognition in another 
way, we shall have no need for introducing such 
an ‘order’ of affection. It seems probable that 
we can do this, although as yet the psychology of 
recognition has not been subjected to sufficient 
experimental investigation to render our remarks 
on the subject more than tentative. The theory 
we suggest is that a notion rather than a feeling of 
familiarity furnishes the basis for the judgment of 
recognition. Such a notion will appear whenever a 
situation presents thoughts, images and affections 
the origin of which it seems possible to trace in 
past experience. In other words, the situation 
means something familiar. The notion expresses 
this fact, and involves a corresponding intention 
toward this end. But such an intention is no 
certain guarantee that the end is achievable. In 
the main, however, experience will validate such 
notions, and we therefore learn to accept them 
without testing them on the spot. This is one of 
the economies practised by the thought-process. 
We simply leave it to future happenings to justify 
our snap-judgments in the matter. Thus, the 
‘feeling of familiarity’ is but the pleasure symp- 
tomatic of an assurance which appears when
-P-A-G-E-146
MEMORY 127 
the tendencies of revival are under way, and 
seem to encounter no obstacles. But it is not 
the first thing to appear, nor an invariable 
consequent, because recognition often occurs with- 
out it.
-P-A-G-E-147
CHAPTER XI 
PERCEPTION 
45. The Nature of Perception 
E are now prepared to consider a third 
synthetic fact of mind, namely,. percep- 
tion. By perception we mean the process by which 
the sensory elements of experience are organized 
into units, or things. When one looks out upon a 
landscape, it is not mere blotches of shade and 
color in areas of different shape and size that 
meet the gaze, but houses and trees, fields and hills, 
clouds and sky, —in a word, objects to which a 
definite significance attaches. 
1. The Analysis of a Percept 
It is evident that the percept, i... any object 
which has a sensory basis and means something, 
is no simple aggregate of sensations. On the con- 
trary, it is both more and less than the sum of the 
possible sensations of the moment: more, in that 
very important additions are supplied from the in- 
dividual mind in which the sensations occur; and 
less, in that the selective ability of the mind grasps 
and assimilates only a portion of what is offered 
by the sensory stimuli. 
A percept is a complex group of elements in 
which the sensational constituents are augmented 
by all manner of centrally aroused elements. Just 
what these are is a matter for special analysis in
-P-A-G-E-148
PERCEPTION 129 
each particular instance. But the most strik- 
ing fact is that over and above its sensory 
and imaginal constituents, the experience pos- 
sesses a form-quality and unit-character which is 
notional. 
2. Hallucinations 
We cannot even affirm that sensation constitutes 
the invariable nucleus of the percept, though this 
is undoubtedly the type of experience with which 
we are dealing. In cases where no adequate sen- 
sory basis is to be found, we have what is known as 
an hallucination. Such experiences are clearly 
abnormal, and it is contended by some that they 
indicate an unusual distortion of sensory experience. . 
It may, indeed, be true that no experience can be 
without sensory constituents, and that in a case 
where an observer attributes an objective reference 
to voices or shapes which are not discernible to 
others, he is really misinterpreting very grossly 
sensations that are actually present. In such an 
event, hallucinations may be regarded as highly 
exaggerated illusions, these being instances in © 
which a sensory content appears to be other than 
in reality it is. 
An instance of this sort came under the writer’s 
observation, and may be mentioned to illustrate 
the point at issue. A patient suffering from a 
serious illness, which interfered with his power of 
speech, complained through his written communi- 
cations that animated figures hovered about the
-P-A-G-E-149
30 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
head-board of his bed. In order that the light from 
the windows should not disturb him, he was lying, 
at the time, with his head at the foot of the bed. 
As the difficulties of writing were considerable, 
he was asked to sketch the shapes that he saw. 
He did so, the result being a fairly accurate copy 
of a geometrical design composed entirely of straight 
lines, which was outlined in gold in a central panel 
of polished ebony on the head-board of the bed. 
This indicates, in this case at least, that the sen- 
sory content of his percept was quite normal, yet 
the hallucination was definitely attached to it, 
and therefore was not a mere projection of a cen- 
trally aroused image. : 
The point which this instance makes emphatic 
is that centrally aroused adjuncts are of great 
importance in the percept, and also that they are 
not simply or, perhaps, even typically of the nature 
of images. It is usual to maintain that a percept 
consists mainly of selected sensations from the 
total situation, supplemented by such images as 
are called forth by association. We have found 
reason to doubt the importance of associated im- 
agery as being the only essential fact of memory, 
and in the case of perception we may be equally 
sceptical as to the validity of the above description, 
As to content, the notions and relations of thought 
undoubtedly play a more important part in the 
formation of the perceptual unit, than does the 
mere accretion of images projected into and fused 
with the sensory content. While it is not neces-
-P-A-G-E-150
PERCEPTION 131 
sary to deny that such projection and fusion do 
take place, it is to the thought-elements that we 
must look for the meaning which is essential to 
this synthesis. 
3. The Percept as Meaning 
The percept, then, is not an aggregate of mental 
elements, for mere aggregates occur, if at all, only 
on the basis of simple associative fusions, whereas 
in the percept it is the meaning or interpretation 
that is important. Hence, a percept must fit into 
the purposive directions of the course of mental 
events and be subject’ to them. Thus, relevant 
thoughts arise in response to the combined effects 
of sensory content and directive tendency. The 
sensory content influences the purpose, and the 
purpose determines the selection of sensations, 
together with the associated and directed supple- 
mentation of thoughts and images. 
Since the significance of perception for our 
mental life consists in making us understand the 
world which surrounds us, it is evident that the 
réle of sensation is typically the most important 
one in the complex. It is the starting-point for 
our interpretation, and if we perceive correctly, 
we must depend largely upon the sensory data 
which are offered. When we fail in this, we 
are subject to illusions, hallucinations and all 
the fallacies that inevitably arise from malobser- 
vation.
-P-A-G-E-151
132 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
4. Illusions 
We have already discussed the nature of hallu- 
cinations. The illusions constitute a distinct 
chapter of experimental psychology, which falls, 
however, without our range. Yet we may say, in 
passing, that an illusion is a percept in which 
the sensory content appears to be different from 
what it is in reality. Although we may know 
exactly what the facts are, the illusion often per- 
sists. This indicates that deep-seated habits and 
congenital tendencies are involved in our per- 
ceptual experience in a manner which often resists 
the purely sensational effects of the stimulus. In 
the geometrical-optical illusions, straight lines 
may appear longer or shorter, curved or changed 
in direction, when accompanied by certain arrange- 
ments of other lines, and it is impossible to overcome 
this illusory effect except by elimination of the 
accompanying lines of influence. Such an elimi- 
nation can be partially effected after practice by 
attentive concentration, but this is not an easy 
matter, since the normal operations of the attention 
do not lead to the elimination of parts in an ex- 
perience, but merely to their subordination in an 
organized whole. 
46. Perceptual Forms 
1. The Universality of Space 
In discussing the sensations, we have referred 
to their attributes as independently variable ad-~
-P-A-G-E-152
PERCEPTION 133 
juncts appearing in the different classes of sense. 
Among these attributes there are two which 
have such wide-reaching significance, that they 
may be correctly regarded as perceptual forms. 
These are the attributes of extent and duration, 
which become, in their perceptual setting, space 
and time. The importance of these. two forms 
in which experience is cast, is self-evident. All 
experience involves a spatial world, even though 
we may not attribute extensity to every sort of 
sensational element. It has been argued that a 
conscious being, bereft of vision and the sensitivi- 
ties of skin, muscle, tendon and joint, would have 
little notion of space. Others, recognizing the in- 
conceivability of such a consciousness, have argued 
with equal vigor that all sensations, whatever 
their kind, must possess the attribute of extension. 
It seems hardly necessary for us to attempt a 
settlement of this dispute. Since tactual sensi- 
tivity is evidently the most fundamental type of 
perceptual experience, it is enough that this be 
granted in order that we may establish the univer- 
sality of space as a form of perception. 
2. The Universality of Time 
As for time, no such question arises, since all 
sensations possess this attribute. Yet even here 
marked differences are noted in the capacities of 
different senses to make themselves emphatic 
through their temporal attributes. Time is judged
-P-A-G-E-153
134 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
much more readily by hearing and muscular sen- 
sation, than it is by vision, taste or smell. The 
universality of time, however, is uncontested. 
We may, therefore, class it with space as an inva- 
riable form of perception. 
3. Intensity as a Universal Form 
The third general attribute of sensation is in- 
tensity. But this apparently does not contribute 
to a perceptual form of the same rank with those 
of space and time, for the reason that it is much 
more strictly a sensational factor. It appears per- 
ceptually rather as a discrete happening than as 
a general and formative mode of experience. We 
have noted its close affiliation with attention, Its 
service is more largely that of aiding the selective 
activities of mind, than of forming elements into 
perceptual groups. But although it does not 
possess the same significance that attaches to 
space and time as agents of perception, we must 
not underestimate its importance as a contributory 
factor. Towards intensive experience the atten- 
tion is directed, and it is precisely the selective 
activity of the attention which is responsible for 
the existence of the percept. But as a universal 
form in which all sensory experience is cast we 
may relegate it to a lower rank than that accorded 
to space and time. 
Let us now consider these two forms in greater 
detail, in order that we may better understand the 
nature of perception.
-P-A-G-E-154
PERCEPTION 135 
47. The Perception of Space 
The most ultimate characteristic of space is 
revealed in the fact of the ‘spreadoutness’ of 
things. This all-pervasive fact is an unanalyzable 
datum of perceptual experience. It is perhaps not 
inconceivable that one may transcend space in a 
’ state of highly absorbed contemplation, or in the 
mystical ecstasy of a seemingly direct communi- 
cation with God, but it is at least beyond our com- 
prehension to approach the concrete world of 
everyday life without regarding it as placed in a 
more or less definite order. The scene extends 
about us with its objects placed discretely, above, 
below, to right and left, near and far, while in the 
midst rests our body, sensing its own parts and its 
environment. 
It is a very complicated situation which con- 
fronts us, but in order to analyze it somewhat, let 
us confine ourselves at first to the facts contrib- 
uted by vision. Here it will be well to distinguish 
between two-dimensional and three-dimensional 
space. The mere ‘spreadoutness’ of things, which 
we found it necessary to postulate as a perceptual 
form, gives us our foundation for visual space- 
perception. ‘The local signs of the visual field 
bring order into an otherwise homogeneous 
expanse by enabling the discrimination of dif- 
ferent points with reference to one another 
and, more especially, to the centre of clearest 
vision.
-P-A-G-E-155
136 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
It is not with two-dimensional space that our 
serious problem arises, but with the three-dimen- 
sional perception of distance away from the observer. 
Here our acquired and not our innate capacities 
play the leading réle in rendering our visual space 
not flat, but solid. Without the bodily mechan- 
ism, and the codperative uses which we are able 
to make-of it, it is improbable that we should be 
able to ‘see’ depth. We note with interest the 
development of these capacities in the child, That 
he cries for the moon, and reaches out to grasp it, 
indicates how inexact is his judgment and how 
different must be his world of space from the well- 
ordered expanse of the normal adult. The chief 
factors that contribute to this acquired depth- 
capacity are of two sorts: (1) There are certain 
purely pictorial signs which experience teaches us 
to regard as significant of distance; and (2) there 
are certain motor mechanisms, mainly of the eye, 
which are involved in the course of visualizing 
near-by objects. 
1. Pictorial Signs 
The pictorial signs that assist in judgments of 
distance are, of course, numerous. They are also, 
in some measure, individual. Any visual charac- 
teristic tending to recur with objects which our 
general experience demonstrates to be at a certain 
distance, is interpreted to signify that distance. 
We therefore base our judgments on our experi- 
ence, and they are contingent on our opportunities
-P-A-G-E-156
PERCEPTION 137 
and needs, and also on the visual peculiarities of 
our habitual environment. We may enumerate 
five of these pictorial signs which are very fre- 
quent in their occurrence, and therefore of especial 
importance. 
(a) Geometrical Perspective. This depends upon 
the optical principle that the area of the retina 
which is stimulated by an object of constant size 
varies inversely with the square of the distance of 
the object from the eye. Under ordinary circum- 
stances, we do not interpret this fact to mean that 
the object in question has grown smaller as it re- 
cedes from us, but that it has become more distant. 
It is evident that we must have some knowledge 
as to the actual size of the object in order that this 
judgment may be of value. But even a strange 
object seldom appears in an environment in which 
there are not other neighboring objects already 
known to us. Accordingly, we can and do make 
our judgments with reference to the objects which 
we know. 
(b) Aerial Perspective. This depends upon at- 
mospheric effects. Since in gazing at distant objects 
we must penetrate a heavier veil of atmospheric 
particles, it happens that the distance is always 
shrouded more or less in a haze, which obliterates 
the local colorings and makes dim the outlines of 
objects. 
(c) Shadows. All solid objects illuminated from 
a single source of light cast shadows, and these 
give us indications as to their corporeal nature.
-P-A-G-E-157
138 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
When the illumination is diffused and equally dis- 
tributed from all directions, we are at a loss to 
make these judgments. This accounts for the 
unreality of some stage-pictures, and also for our 
failure to take note of spatial discrepancies which 
would otherwise prove disturbing. The farther 
removed such stage-pictures are from the actual 
effects and conditions of normal scenes, the more 
readily we can accept them as visions of an ideal 
and imaginative realm. 
(d) Superposition. An infallible sign of distance 
is produced when one object cuts across another. 
At once we know that the partly hidden object is 
behind the other. 
(e) Movement. This is but an application of the 
first mentioned sign, that of apparent size, to a 
moving object. It is evident that 2 moving object 
will appear to rush across the field of vision if it 
is near us, whereas with the same actual speed it 
will seem to creep along, if it is sufficiently distant. 
Similarly, we can produce apparent movement in a 
static object by actual movement of the head. 
By means of these signs, distance and solidity 
are ‘seen’, that is, they enable a fairly accurate 
interpretation of three-dimensional space-relations. 
That their importance is really very great is ap- 
parent from the satisfactoriness of spatial repre- 
sentations on the flat surface of the painter’s 
canvas, for it is largely by means of pictorial signs, 
such as the first four of these, that the painter is 
able to awaken a sense of space in his spectators.
-P-A-G-E-158
PERCEPTION 139 
2. Stereoscopic Vision 
But there are other components involved in the 
visual perception of space which the painter can- 
not use, and which are so compelling in their force 
that they are known as the true stereoscopic indices. 
These are visual in a secondary sense, since they 
depend upon optical mechanisms and adjustments. 
They may be described under three main heads, as 
dependent upon (a) accommodation, (b) convergence, 
and (c) retinal disparity. 
(a) As for accommodation, we mean by this the 
automatic adjustment of the lens of the eye, in 
order that a clear image may be focussed upon the 
retina. We are not conscious of producing the nec- 
essary muscular changes, except in case of strain 
when the object is very near or very far from the eye. 
It is found, nevertheless, that judgments of relative 
distance can be made with a single eye. Some 
authorities have supposed this to be an evidence 
that the muscular adjustments which have occurred 
are registered in our consciousness, even though we 
do not attend to them as discrete facts. But recent 
research tends to discredit this view. The indica- 
tions now are that we judge depth only on the basis 
of visual changes which accompany more or less 
sudden alterations in accommodation. 
(6) Convergence involves the two eyes, and re- 
sults from the automatic tendency to bring the 
fixated object to the central and most clearly 
seeing areas of the two retine. The muscles
-P-A-G-E-159
140 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
of the eye-balls work in harmony to produce 
this result, thus determining an angle of conver- 
gence formed by two imaginary straight lines 
extending from the point fixated to the centres 
of clearest vision of the two retine. This angle 
increases in size, with a corresponding increase in 
convergence, when the object approaches the eyes; 
and decreases when the object recedes until, at a 
certain distance, the axes, or lines of regard, are 
practically parallel. Here again, except in the case 
of strain, which is noticeable when the conver- 
gence is great, we are unable to attend to these 
muscular sensations. It appears that convergence 
has its effect in the same manner as accommoda- 
tion through the accompanying alterations in vision. 
(©) The fact of retinal disparity is more compli- 
cated, yet it is but the outcome of optical principles 
of projection as applied to the two retinal surfaces. 
A simple experiment will elucidate the fact. If we 
hold our two forefingers vertically before us, the 
one directly behind the other, and fixate the nearer, 
the one behind will appear to be doubled, one 
finger appearing to the right and the other to the 
left of the fixated finger. If we fixate the farther 
of the two, the near one is doubled in a similar 
manner. It appears from this that we can see 
singly and distinctly with two eyes only such points 
as are at a constant distance from us. All points 
at other distances, either nearer or farther, are 
doubled. This fact is expressed by the doctrine of 
corresponding retinal points. For every point on
-P-A-G-E-160
PERCEPTION I4I 
one retina there is a corresponding point on the 
other retina. When the two are simultaneously 
stimulated, they are seen as one. Whenever a 
single object stimulates points on the two retine 
which are non-corresponding, or disparate, the 
object appears to be more or less vague in outline, 
or doubled. 
Now, since these doublings or displacements of 
objects depend upon their distances with reference 
to a fixated point, and since their displacements 
are determined with reference both to amount and 
to direction by rigid optical principles, it follows 
that we have here an additional set of pictorial 
signs for our binocular vision which we can and do 
interpret in terms of distance, rather than accept 
them for what they really are. If our muscular 
convergence did not act automatically, and our 
eyes were more rigid in their adjustments, we should 
more frequently experience the confused doublings 
which our experiment revealed. But since experi- 
ence teaches that these doublings are deceptive, and 
since we have great facility in altering our conver- 
gence and fixation-points, we fail to notice these 
discrepancies except to interpret them as indica- 
tions of distance. 
It is the application of this principle that makes 
possible the illusion of distance and solidity pro- 
vided by the apparatus known as the stereoscope. 
Two photographic views taken from slightly dif- 
ferent positions are presented through the stereo- 
scope, each to its proper eye. The result is a
-P-A-G-E-161
142 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
fused visual effect, affording us some of the points 
for judging distance which we obtain from nature. 
The effect is not complete, as some have main- 
tained, because the varying accommodations of 
the lenses, and convergences of muscular adjust- 
ment are not called into play. This accounts for 
the fact that there is always a certain unreality 
in these views, a sense that the space which we 
apprehend through the stereoscope is illusory. 
These three components of visual space-percep- 
tion are all dependent for their effectiveness upon 
the actual nearness of at least one of the objects 
upon which the judgment of distance is based. 
For remote objects, without reference to a near 
point, differences in accommodation and conver- 
gence are negligible quantities, and no discrep- 
ancies are detected between points of the two 
retine stimulated by the same object. It follows 
that the purely pictorial characteristics are the 
only ones upon which our judgment of distance 
and solidity can rely when the scene is sufficiently 
remote, and it is for this reason that landscape 
painting has been described as ‘the representation 
of things seen at a distance’. We may go even 
farther, and say that since the painter has only the 
purely pictorial signs with which to create a sense 
of space on his flat surface, he must, in order to 
give verisimilitude to his work, treat all his subjects, 
whether they are to appear near at hand or remote, 
in accordance with the natural conditions of things 
seen at a distance. When he does this the result
-P-A-G-E-162
PERCEPTION 143 
is convincing, for it is a part of his art to place 
his picture in an ideal space, having no immediate 
point of contact with the actual space of the spec- 
tator’s environment. Since the principles he applies 
are natural principles, we are able to understand 
his spatial effects, and shall detect no discrepancies 
in them. 
3. Tactual and Kinesthetic Elements 
We have discussed the visual perception of space 
at some length, in order that we might have a 
concrete example of the manner in which sense- 
impressions are fused and interpreted as percep- 
tual units. We have made frequent reference to 
‘experience’ as the court of appeal which makes 
valid the interpretations given to these sensory 
complexes. The grounds for such ‘experience’ are 
various, and it would carry us too far from our 
programme to attempt to trace them to any con- 
siderable extent. But we may say, in general, 
that the principal foundation of all our spatial 
experience is afforded us by our tactual and kin- 
esthetic sensations. The fact that simultaneous 
tactual sensations are not presented to us as un- 
differentiated fusions, but are discriminable as to 
their situation and order, was indicated by the 
attribute of local sign which we found to attend 
both visual and tactual sensations. The addition 
of kinesthesis is of vast importance in bringing 
together by a sensory bond tactual and visual sen- 
sations which are separate in time. It is through
-P-A-G-E-163
144 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
experiences of this sort that we are able to know 
distances, by having walked them, or by having 
exerted the muscles of our arms, as in throwing, 
to cover the ground in question. All knowledge 
of this sort is acquired very gradually, and it 
varies greatly in different persons. At first there 
is but the vague ‘spreadoutness’ of things, with 
some attributive local significance. Much testing 
and trying is necessary before the well-ordered 
spatial universe of the average adult mind can 
be achieved. Even with reference to the order of 
objects in a two-dimensional space, the genesis is a 
slow process, as may be noted from the fact that 
a two-year old child can ‘see’ a picture as well 
when it is reversed as when it is right-side up. 
It is, then, to our tactual sensations and the 
attendant movements of our body that we must 
refer in testing out our spatial experience, and 
they are the guarantors of the validity attaching 
in later life to the visual signs detected in objects 
with which we are not in immediate contact. 
48. The Perception of Time 
Time as a perceptual form may be treated more 
briefly than space, since it appears to rest more 
directly upon the sensory attribute of duration. 
What we note most especially in the temporal 
aspect of things is the marked tendency towards 
groupings, which vary in a complicated manner, in 
accordance with three distinct kinds of motivation. 
First, the sensory stimuli may be discrete or con-
-P-A-G-E-164
PERCEPTION 145 
tinuous, and if continuous, periodic or non-periodic. 
Second, the physiological processes of our bodies 
are in part discrete and non-periodic, but more 
largely continuous or at least periodic. Thus an 
attack of indigestion produces discrete effects 
which are only contingent upon the specific causes 
operative at the time, but the general process of 
digestion is repeated at intervals, with a fair degree 
of regularity. Third, our mental processes are not 
entirely dependent upon the temporal characteris- 
tics of the physical stimuli or physiological processes. 
Attention favors now the discrete and non-periodic, 
and again the continuous and periodic. The tem- 
poral form of preception is, then, subject to these 
three variable occasions, and the perceptual units 
which result are the combined effects of these three 
causes. 
1. Intervals 
Attention affords us two different temporal forms 
of perception, which we may describe as intervals 
and durations. The first are brief intervals, i.e., 
periods under four seconds. This period marks 
the upper limit of our capacity to apprehend an 
event as a unitary pulsation. Beyond this length 
of time there occurs a disaggregation, and the 
interval falls into a varying number of units. 
We notice this fact in the so-called ‘fluctuations 
of attention’, These fluctuations, as we have 
seen, are not entirely a matter of our inability to 
hold a fact before us in mind for a longer period
-P-A-G-E-165
146 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
than four seconds. Physiological fatigue of the 
organs stimulated is largely responsible for this 
more or less periodic ebb and flow in mental hap- 
penings. Under certain circumstances, the sub- 
division of intervals which exceed our capacity 
to hold them as units is more or less regular. It 
then appears as rhythm. 
It is a matter of debate whether our sense of 
rhythm is innate, or is entirely an acquisition of 
experience. We need not enter into this contro- 
versy here. In either case there can be no doubt 
that it is universal. Although its development in 
different individuals shows great variations, there 
are, nevertheless, marked tendencies towards rhyth- 
mic groupings manifest in all mental happenings. 
The simplest and most natural of these appears to 
be the grouping by twos and threes.. These in 
combinations give us the basis for the familiar 
rhythms of musical setting. It is, however, in- 
correct to suppose that all rhythms are based upon 
groupings of twos, threes and their multiples. 
Rhythms of five and seven may also be acquired, 
and we find them in frequent use among semi- 
civilized peoples who have brought the rhythmic 
aspect of their music to high development. But it 
would appear that the groupings of five and seven 
are less frequent than those of two and three 
only because the sense of rhythm develops with 
serial muscular responses which are repeated, and 
the nature of our more frequently repeated activi- 
ties favors the smaller divisions rather than the
-P-A-G-E-166
PERCEPTION 147 
larger. Our incapacity to hold any one fact for 
a period longer than four seconds causes the con- 
scious sequence to break up into parts. For the 
sake of simplicity these divisions tend to be regular. 
This, together with the character of the stimuli 
and their conformity to physiological conditions, 
determines the number accorded to a group. 
2. Durations 
The second form of temporal perception afforded 
by the attention has no immediate connection with 
the continuities which characterize certain physio- 
logical processes, and it is not, properly speaking, 
rhythmic. This provides us with our sense of 
duration, rather than of interval, and is referable 
to the activity of a directive tendency. All those 
mental happenings which stand under the mon- 
archical supervision of a single conscious direc- 
tion tend to be grouped into one duration. These 
units are usually of appreciable length and are non- 
periodic. The length is a variable quantity. It 
is not measured by the fluctuations of attention, 
either pure or of the derived fatigue-order, but solely 
by the number of interesting events which happen 
during the period. Under the influence of a strong 
and steady directive tendency, such durations may 
persist for hours, days, or even longer. Distrac- 
tions and interruptions have no part in the proc- 
ess. When we return to our task, we pick up the 
threads where we left off, and go on with our prob- 
lem under the same supervising guidance which
-P-A-G-E-167
148 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
was present at the start. It happens, then, that 
various directions are operative in our daily lives, 
issuing from the different problems before us. 
These succeed one another as the situation may 
suggest and justify their appearance. 
Some of these directions operate with a periodic 
regularity which has its root in physiological con- 
ditions. Thus, the diurnal course of night and day, 
with its corresponding physiological conditions of 
fatigue and rest, determines sleep and awakening. 
Periodically changing conditions in the alimentary 
tract determine the regular recurrence of hunger at 
meal-times. In addition to such directions as these, 
the diverse problems of our daily life prompt 
activities the duration of which is subject to the 
grouping of larger units with their subordinate 
parts. These durations vary in accordance with the 
nature of the problem: whether, for instance, it be 
a continuous or a discrete activity that is prompted. 
When we speak of a sustained piece of work, we 
mean an activity entirely supervised by a single 
motive. It may require months for its com- 
pletion. During that time the actual work may 
be subject to numerous subordinate directions. 
Furthermore, it will be interrupted by all manner 
of irrelevant tasks which have no other bearing on 
the work than that they interfere with the smooth 
course it would probably take, if such interrup- 
tions were avoided. 
So far as concerns the actual time-judgments 
we are able to make of these durations, they
-P-A-G-E-168
PERCEPTION 149 
are naturally very inaccurate. Since we judge in 
terms of particular events, and the subordinate 
problems that occur, we are confronted with a 
paradoxical result. A duration filled with an in- 
teresting succession of happenings, all of which 
are closely supervised by one general directive 
tendency, appears to run off with great rapid- 
ity. If we recall it, however, the many recurring 
thoughts and associated images make it appear 
longer than it really was. An interesting illustra- 
tion of this paradox is afforded by our memory of 
dream-states. It may be objectively determined 
that a certain dream consumes in actual time 
but the few seconds elapsing between its sensory 
stimulus and the awakening. Yet the number of 
apparently discrete events which are later recalled 
makes it appear as a thing of hours. 
The opposite to this paradox is recorded in the 
familiar fact that time drags when experienced 
events are uninteresting. When waiting for a 
train, for instance, with no other conscious purpose 
than that of starting on our journey, we keep our 
attention on the time, and so it seems interminable. 
Yet when we recall the experience later, we are at 
a loss to understand why it should have seemed so 
long, since we can revive so few of its details. 
3. Summary 
To summarize what has been said, there appear 
to be two temporal forms of perception: brief in- 
tervals and longer durations. The brevity of the
-P-A-G-E-169
150 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
first group is conditioned by the fluctuations of 
attention, which are in part, at least, the result of a 
physiological insufficiency, or fatigue. The sense 
of rhythm, its origin and development, is closely 
correlated with this fact. The second group, com- 
prising the longer durations, is, on the contrary, 
subject to the directive tendencies which issue 
from the problems confronting us, the unification 
of our mental happenings being dependent upon 
the persistence of these directions in spite of inter- 
ruptions.

CHAPTER XII 
IDEATION 
49. General Considerations 
_ FOURTH synthetic fact, which now calls for 
investigation, is that commonly known as 
ideation. By ideation we mean a process of syn- 
thesis in the realm of the productive and repro- 
ductive activities of mind, which corresponds to 
perception in the realm of the immediately given. 
Whereas the perceptive process accounts for the 
percept with its sensory foundation, the ideational 
process issues in the idea, a unit the structural con- 
stituents of which are chiefly thoughts and images. 
The problems with their directive tendencies are 
responsible for the formation of ideas. Being rela- 
tively independent of the sensory facts of experi- 
ence, ideas transcend, in some measure, the forms 
of space and time found to be essential in the 
production of the percept. 
It is this process which is responsible for our 
ability to reason, to imagine creatively, and to re- 
vive our past experiences in accordance with our 
needs. We have already explained the nature of 
reproduced imagery, and we have posited the exist- 
ence of imageless elements of thought: — notions 
and relations. We have not yet attempted to show 
the derivation of the latter. Images are unques- 
tionably derived from sensations. Are thoughts 
also derived from this source? We cannot answer
-P-A-G-E-171
152 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
this question categorically at the present time, but 
the peculiar dependency of thoughts upon directive 
acts indicates that they are not simple derivations, 
as are the images. We have seen that association 
accounts for a mechanical sort of revival in which 
purposive guidance plays no conspicuous part. 
This does not account, however, for the produc- 
tion of notions and relations. We have described 
the notion as the essence of a mental happening 
which, when originally experienced, may have in~ 
volved many and diverse elements. A relation is 
our apprehension of connections subsisting between 
mental contents and attributes. Now, the essence 
of a situation stripped of its sensory components 
could, of course, never be obtained if the complete 
sensory situation had not been present. But the 
principle of mechanical association does not suffice 
to explain the result. The wider-reaching and freer 
activities of purposive direction are the necessary 
postulates for this. That notions are imageless is 
also an evidence that they are of a different elemen- 
tal kind from sensation. 
With reference to relations, it is again clear that 
the mere association of images furnishes no suffi- 
cient ground for our awareness of likeness and 
difference, subordination and superordination, cor- 
relation, and all the other comparative aspects of 
experience. We may, therefore, conclude that the 
relatedness of things is an immediate fact of ex- 
perience and that the purpose which guides our 
mental happenings is essentially a relating activity.
-P-A-G-E-172
IDEATION 153 
But a relating activity and the consciousness of 
relation are not the same. Relations are apparent 
among the elements of experience, but the relating 
activity is not necessarily a conscious fact, any more 
than is association. The mental activities are, as 
we have seen, both conscious and unconscious. At 
times we are aware of an attitude conducive to 
the establishment of relations, or to the revival 
of associations, but in neither case is this attitude 
a necessary constituent of the mental activity 
which establishes relationships or associative con- 
nections. 
50. The Process of Ideation 
We may picture the process of ideation as follows. 
Let us start with a concrete situation, perceptual 
in its nature. This involves attention and mem- 
ory, and gives rise to tendencies determining the 
general course of the mental happenings that fol- 
low, as to both their contents and the general and 
specific bodily adjustments which result. In cases 
where the situation provokes an immediate adjust- 
ment, no idea need be formed, but, in other in- 
stances, where a physical adjustment cannot satisfy 
the immediate demands of the situation, the ensu- 
ing process is largely of a reflective order. Ideas 
are thus formed which are in part notional and 
in part imaginal, together with the conscious rela- 
tions dictated by the situation through its directive 
tendencies. In this manner, past and present ex- 
perience is organized for the purpose of future
-P-A-G-E-173
154 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
adjustment. But although the primary material 
with which this synthetic process operates is given 
in the percept, with its associated notions and 
images derived from the past, ideation cannot be 
regarded as a mere aggregate of such elements. 
The relations established are many of them new, 
and they, in turn, contribute to the creation of 
notions that are formed for the first time. Thus 
the idea which results is in part a creative prod- 
uct, and represents a true development of the 
material primarily given. This is what is meant 
by creative imagination: the capacity to establish 
new relations and to form new notions on the 
basis of the contents supplied by direct presenta- 
tion or revival of memory. As already pointed 
out in our section on the image, it is not new 
contents, but new syntheses, which are productive 
of these creative fantasies. ‘‘The light that never 
was on sea or land” transcends sensational and 
imaginal experience, not by its intrinsic uniqueness 
of content, but by the meaning which is attributed 
to it. It is, of course, true that imaginal contents 
are often altered in the course of ideation. Sche- 
matic images may thus be formed that are impor- 
tant adjuncts to the process of thinking. The 
images which serve us in reasoning are, therefore, 
not necessarily direct representatives of perceptual 
experience. 
It is difficult to draw the line clearly between an 
idea anda notion. The notion is, however, strictly 
imageless and elementary, whereas the idea is
-P-A-G-E-174
IDEATION 155 
always complex, and may be in large measure 
imaginal. The idea is a synthetic fact founded 
upon notions, as a percept is a synthetic fact 
founded upon sensations. In its incipiency, the 
notion may be vague and general. As it develops 
into an idea it establishes relations founded on 
other notions and images, the appearance of which 
is directed, even if they do not actually arise in 
consciousness. 
51. Associative versus Directive Tendencies 
The process of ideation may be further classified 
by reference to two extreme types of reflective ex- 
perience in which the purposes of consciousness 
are imperfectly served. These extreme types are 
often found in cases of mental derangement, but 
are also familiar in normal experience. The one 
extreme is afforded by an over-emphasis of the as- 
sociative tendency, and the other by an over-em- 
phasis of the directive tendency. The first instance 
is described as the chain-like process of thought. 
Every situation sets in readiness for revival, images 
and notions which memory provides. If the direc- 
tive tendency fails to operate selectively among 
these various factors, they will arise in con- 
sciousness in accordance with their own intrinsic 
capacities, reproductive and perseverative. Each 
recurring fact will, in turn, associate others, — 
the result being a ‘flight of ideas’ which is, on the 
whole, incoherent and purposeless. 
While the ‘flight of ideas’ is symptomatic of cer-
-P-A-G-E-175
156 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
tain forms of insanity, it is by no means restricted 
to diseases of the mind. It is a marked character- 
istic of dreams, and is likewise found in the garru- 
lous individual of slight intelligence, who ‘runs on’ 
from one idea to another, with little or no definite 
intention save to ‘make talk’. 
The other extreme is met when a certain direc- 
tion of thought becomes dominant to such a degree 
that instead of permitting a rational development, 
the individual constantly reverts to the same idea. 
We call this a ‘fixed idea’, because the mind cannot 
seem to get away from it. This, too, is symptom- 
atic in certain mental diseases, as in melancholia, 
where it is impossible to arouse the patient from an 
affectively toned prepossession of woe-begone im- 
potence; or in the delusions of persecution which 
typify the paranoiac. But it is also characteristic 
of some normal minds that have fallen into the 
rut of prejudice. The man with ‘one idea’ which 
has been formed and hardened until it permits of 
no modifications is an illustration of this ten- 
dency. 
It is between these two extremes that the proc- 
ess of ideation manifests itself as a truly progres- 
sive, synthetic operation. Without being at the 
mercy of every chance associative tendency that 
may occur, and yet resisting the tendency of too 
rigid a control, it steers its course amid the mani- 
fold data offered, selecting here, rejecting there, 
following the subordinate tendencies which arise 
with every modification in the situation, yet never
-P-A-G-E-176
IDEATION 157 
losing touch with the general aim inspired by 
the original problem. In this manner the simple 
process of ideation becomes a more complex process 
of reasoning, in which percepts and ideas supplant 
one another in the onward course of thinking. 
52. The Psychology of Logic 
The psychology of reasoning is a field in which 
some important work has been done, while much 
still remains undone. Anything approaching a 
detailed study of its various phases is not within 
the limited range of our present purpose. What 
has already been attempted is but a brief out- 
line of the synthetic process of ideation. Yet we 
have seen that thinking and reasoning are but more 
extended processes of the same order. With the 
aim before us of securing an introduction to the 
contents and operations of mind in its more general 
aspects, there is not much more to be said on 
this topic. But it will perhaps be well for us to 
introduce a few of the terms with which Logic has 
made us familiar, in order that we may at least 
place them accurately with regard to their psycho- 
logical bearings. 
Judgment is the first of these terms meriting our 
consideration. The logician usually treats judgment 
as the element of the reasoning process. Psycho- 
logically, judgment is a relating activity. The 
terms related may belong to any of the elemental 
categories, although we cannot be quite sure that 
an affectional element as such can be related.
-P-A-G-E-177
158 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
It appears more probable that a notion de- 
rived from the affection constitutes the term 
with which the process of judgment operates in 
this case. 
The logician usually asserts that the relation of 
judgment is always predicative. Whether or not 
this involves a distinct and limited type of relation- 
ship is a question that is still debatable. Further 
research is requisite before the question can be 
definitely decided. It is evident that the judgment 
issues from a conscious problem, and is never a 
mere automatic process. Furthermore, recalling 
our differentiation of the stages of consciousness, we 
may observe that the judgment does not appear 
until the stage of potential knowledge, or the 
completely established fact is reached. It is absent 
at the stages of simple presentation and aware- 
ness. It always involves self-activity in the 
form of an expression concerning a circumstance 
which is definitely known. We must distinguish 
it from perception, in which the expressive act need 
not be present, and also from inference, which is a 
further development of the judgment. 
Conception and inference are more complicated 
relational processes. Conception for the logician 
issues in a term, the concept, which embodies the 
essence of a number of judgments, and thus ex- 
presses in nuclear form the abstract or generalized 
meaning of a series of mental happenings. The 
process of abstraction, psychologically, is one of di- 
recting the attention to the dependent parts of a
-P-A-G-E-178
IDEATION 159 
situation. The isolation of these parts involves the 
creation of notional units which are detachable from 
the total situation and may thereafter be thought 
separately. The process of generalization is not 
different in kind, but rather in direction. The 
notion formed in generalization is one which 
involves the essence of the whole rather than of 
the part. But so far as concerns the simple 
judgments involved, they are all of one type. A 
concept is, therefore, nothirig more than an idea 
derived from a more or less complicated succession 
of judgments. Whether the idea is expressive of 
identities among the parts of different situations, 
or of identities derived from a comparison of 
situations taken as a whole, is a matter of the 
direction taken by the process rather than a pecu- 
liarity of the judgments as such. 
In the case of inference we have what the logician 
calls a developed judgment. This is but a series 
of judgments which have a certain trend or direc- 
tion. The distinction from the process of con- 
ception is again a matter of purpose rather than of 
kind. The inference does not stress the formation 
of an abstract or general notion, but rather the 
serial development of the judgments. It termin- 
ates, therefore, in a judgment rather than in a 
notion or idea. The kinds of inference are usually 
defined as deductive and inductive. These describe 
the purpose in view, and the direction which the 
reasoning takes, whether it be from the more to 
the less comprehensive, or vice versa.
-P-A-G-E-179
160 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
63. Summary 
Ideation, then, is a synthetic process which oper- 
ates with all the mental elements, but is founded 
typically upon the notional and imaginal orders 
of experience. It may be either simple or complex, 
brief or of long duration. Its varied possibilities 
compass all manner of relating activity, and all 
kinds of directive tendency. Certain phases of 
ideational activity are quite direct and automatic, 
but the more complex forms always issue from con- 
scious problems with definite directions, and it is 
these, in fine, that constitute such diversified forms 
as creative imagination, recollection, and reasoning.
-P-A-G-E-180
CHAPTER XIII 
REACTION 
54. Introduction 
FIFTH synthetic fact we shall designate as 
reaction. Thus far, we have considered men- 
tal happenings with reference to their content, 
their aims and tendencies. We must now devote 
ourselves to a discussion of the outcome of these 
happenings. Without knowing how and where 
they issue, we can have but an imperfect under- 
standing as to their nature and general usefulness. 
It is sufficiently evident from what has gone be- 
fore that our minds are in intimate connection with 
bodies which we have described as of two general 
sorts: the external world of our environment, and 
the internal world of our corporeal organism. The 
environment stimulates us through our sense- 
organs, which may be termed the receptors, and we 
respond by adjustment of the muscles, or effectors. 
We describe this process as reaction. Life, as we 
know it, is a matter of constant adjustment and 
readjustment between these two worlds. When 
such adjustments cease, death ensues. It is within 
this system that mind operates to give aim and 
control to life-activities. Whether mind can exist 
without life-activities of this sort, and whether 
life can exist without mind, are questions which 
our present knowledge does not permit us to an- 
swer. But we have evidence of life with a mini-
-P-A-G-E-181
162 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
mum of mental activity, and likewise of mind 
with a minimum of such life-activity as the word 
“pehavior’ suggests. 
55. Reflex Reaction 
In discussing reaction we may begin with those 
simple forms in which the conjunction of receptor 
and effector appears to be most direct. We refer 
to these activities as reflex. The life-processes of 
digestion, circulation and respiration ,are all of 
this direct and seemingly automatic type. Certain 
characteristic stimulations: — food in the stomach, 
blood in the heart, air in the lungs, — are followed 
by adequate muscular and glandular responses, 
which eventuate in the assimilation of the food, 
the pumping forth of the blood, the expansion 
and contraction of the lungs. But there are also 
many other muscular activities provoked in a sim- 
ilarly direct and unintentional manner. We may 
mention the pupillary reflex of the iris, the accom- 
modation of the optic lenses, the convergence of 
the eyeballs, the winking reflex, and the knee- 
jerk, as typical. It is customary to call these in- 
nate, that is, naturally inherent in the muscular 
mechanism concerned. Yet most of them are 
more or less crude and inexact at birth, and all are 
subject to experiential modification and organiza- 
tion. 
It is our lack of knowledge concerning the original 
nature of these actions — how far they are assign- 
able to purely mechanical causes, and how far
-P-A-G-E-182
REACTION 163 
they may be conditioned by vague yet non-mechan- 
ical directions — which makes it impossible for us 
to answer the question whether or not life can ex- 
ist without purpose. But however this may be, 
the incipient life-processes of the human infant, 
as well as the complete life-activities of many of 
the lower forms of organism, are largely conditioned 
by direct responses, in which the mechanical in- 
terplay of environmental stimulation and motor 
capacity of response are the prime factors involved. 
56. Instinctive Reaction 
The next step in the course of tracing the reac- 
tions of mind is furnished by the instincts. 
Instincts are also usually described as inherited 
tendencies of reaction. They differ, however, from 
the reflexes in being more complex and less direct. 
Furthermore, the question as to their mechanical 
origin and nature is even more pressing than that 
raised by the reflexes. The meaning of an instinct 
is found in the end which it serves, and this is not 
explained by considering it merely as an aggre- 
gate of reflexes. 
Let us take as an illustration the nesting instinct 
in birds. _We might suppose that certain stimula- 
tions of a complicated sort, arising from physio- 
logical processes involved in conception and in the 
development of eggs in the female bird, prompted 
a certain chain of reflex activities which resulted 
in the construction of a nest for the eggs. But the 
difficulty of such a view consists in the fact that
-P-A-G-E-183
164 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
the reactions are not of this direct order. The bird 
must seek material for its nest, and a suitable place 
to build it. The process may involve all its motor 
capacities, and though each one be regarded in it- 
self as a reflex, no mechanical explanation seems 
adequate to account for the actual behavior that 
results. It is only when we read these organic 
reactions in the light of an underlying purpose 
which determines the general course pursued, and 
holds the animal to its task despite all obstacles and 
distractions, that we seem to approach the true 
nature of instinctive activity. 
When we describe the instincts as innate, we 
emphasize the fact that these purposes appear 
to operate with some degree of success the first 
time they are used. Experience is not respon- 
sible for their origin. The hypothesis which we 
seem obliged to accept is, therefore, favorable to 
the inheritance, not merely of certain organic 
mechanisms, but also of fundamental tendencies 
which guide the complicated activities toward ends 
expressing the needs and aims of organic life. It 
is not necessary, however, to regard these reac- 
tions as a result of conscious direction, such as we 
found to exist in the process of ideation. Yet we 
need not assume that they are entirely blind. In 
so far as we know such activities introspectively, 
we describe them as impulses. These are chiefly 
sensational experiences in which kinesthesis is 
the characteristic element. For theoretical reasons 
we may assume that a sensitivity of this sort, how-

ever vague, may reach back into the very incip- 
iency of organic life. But also the origins of our 
thoughts, — the notions and relations, — may be 
traced back to this primitive capacity for instinc- 
tive direction. If sensations of some vague sort 
are the invariable accompaniment of all reflex 
acts, then notions and relations, though equally 
vague, may find their natural origin in those ten- 
dencies which direct behavior. 
Instinctive reactions can, therefore, be regarded 
as complex organic responses which are reflex as to 
their individual nature, but are combined and syn- 
thesized by original directive tendencies of an innate 
order. 
Instincts are numerous, and no very satisfactory 
classification has as yet been made of them. They 
are defined, however, by the most fundamental 
needs of an organism. They appear at different 
stages in development, as such fundamental needs 
are made manifest. Those which serve the pur- 
pose of self-preservation are perhaps the most 
essential and the earliest to appear. But aside 
from the tendencies to seek food and shelter, 
there is early evidence of acquisitiveness and curi- © 
osity, upon which are based most of the later 
achievements of the organism through the forma- 
tion of habits. The group of reactions which centre 
about the process of organic reproduction and the 
attendant needs of caring for the offspring are also 
instinctive. In short, whatever behavior must be 
in some measure perfect or serviceable in its first
-P-A-G-E-185
166 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
appearance, is provided for by the instinctive re- 
actions. 
67. Habitual Reaction 
The plasticity or modifiability of organic reac- 
tions is manifest in the repetition of a purposive 
activity. These modifications are made possible 
by the retentive capacities which we have found 
to be at the basis of memory, and they lead to the 
formation of habits. Habits, which constitute the 
third step in the development of behavior, are com- 
plex reactions, relatively invariable with respect 
to the combination of reactions involved. They 
are characterized by the fact that they are ac- 
quired and not inherited, though they are but 
modifications of reflex and instinctive tendencies. 
A simple habit may appear to consist merely in a 
certain combination of reflex tendencies, asin the 
familiar illustration of the burnt child’s fear of fire. 
Prior to the formation of this habit, there were the 
original tendencies: to grasp the bright object, and 
to withdraw from the source of the pain which 
followed. The habit of shunning this particular 
kind of bright object is formed when the tendency 
to withdraw is motivated upon the appearance of 
the object and before the pain is senséd. 
Many ingenious explanations have been ad- 
vanced to show how this modification in the original 
serial order of events is effected. Some refer it to 
the capacity to associate the two events and to 
react simultaneously to a situation which is in
-P-A-G-E-186
REACTION 167 
part sensory (the bright object), and in part memory 
(the recollection of pain), the result being a conflict 
between the two motor tendencies, and conse- 
quently no reaction. For others, it is the resultant 
‘satisfaction’ or ‘dissatisfaction’ which operates 
in the selection of the more suitable reaction, and 
thus binds the serial activities into one unit of 
behavior. A third group of theorists have at- 
tempted an explanation in purely mechanical 
terms, by the aid of hypothetical principles applied 
to the flow of the nervous currents. 
The first kind of explanation is inadequate, 
because it is not evident that the child must recall 
his former pain in order to fear the fire. The 
second kind meets with the objection that too much 
is expected of the resultant affection, since it must 
needs have some capacity of a retroactive sort in 
order to attach itself to processes which, as. origi- 
nally experienced, possessed no such affective tone. 
If this is to be possible, a synthesis of the com- 
plete situation must be first provided, and it does 
not appear from what we know of affection that 
it has any such powers of grouping serial mental 
happenings together. The third kind of explana- 
tion, though satisfactory as far as it goes, is subject 
to the charge that it is purely hypothetical, inas- 
much as our knowledge of neural activities fur- 
nishes us at present with little or no ground for 
the assumptions postulated. 
In the light of the explanation which we have 
found applicable to mental happenings in general,
-P-A-G-E-187
168 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
it may be suggested that this and all other modi- 
fications of reaction are made possible, not by 
the associative process of revival or the end-effect 
of a feeling-tone, but by the directive process 
issuing in the formation of a notion of some sort 
embodying the mental essence of the situation. 
Without the necessity of a concrete revival, the 
notion is given with the situation and is a formid- 
able part of it. Thus, with the recurrence of the 
flame, it is no longer a mere bright light stimulating 
the reaction of grasping that is presented, but a 
percept embracing the meaning of the original 
situation as a complex event. The reaction thus 
involves not one but many tendencies, which 
accounts for the resultant inertia. To be sure, 
a habit:of this kind is not always formed from 
one experience. In the case of the moth fluttering 
about the flame until it meets its death, we see 
a form of behavior in which the attractive force 
of the light stimulates reactions that are too firmly 
mechanized to be modified by the disastrous ex- 
periences ensuing. But in so far as behavior is 
modifiable, that is, in so far as the organism is 
capable of learning, we may attribute this to 
the action of the directive tendencies which are 
capable of adding some increment of knowing to 
what would otherwise be a mere accretion of sen- 
sations in serial order. Under the influence of 
directive tendencies that are originally but un- 
conscious strivings, mere tendencies ‘to do some- 
thing’, there develop synthetic units of behavior
-P-A-G-E-188
REACTION 169 
in which serial activities are transformed and a 
perceptual type of reaction results. This selective 
activity accounts for the fact that these units are 
formed while the action is in progress, and are 
not dependent upon associated ideas or affec- 
tions, such as those of ‘satisfaction’, which, in a 
strictly serial order, would appear only after the 
whole course of the original experience had been 
reénacted. 
Any explanation in neurological terms must 
account for these general facts. While such an 
explanation is highly desirable, it can but afford 
a parallel for what we have thus far been able to 
describe in mental terms. Whether the directive 
tendency is in its essential nature a purely physi- 
ological activity, or whether it is in part or wholly 
a mental activity involving conscious potentiali- 
ties of the notional order, is an open question. But 
our present information on the subject seems to 
favor the latter alternative. 
We must not overlook the fact that serial activi- 
ties of a purely reflex kind do become associated 
with one another. But if, in attempting to make 
our view of reaction systematic, we seem justi- 
fied in the assumption that all life-processes have 
something purposive about them, it will be unnec- 
essary to suppose that any combination of re- 
flexes ever becomes fixed in habit-form without the 
operation of a directive tendency. This does not 
mean that all acquired forms of behavior are useful, 
but only that they tend to be useful, since they are
-P-A-G-E-189
170 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
formed with some more or less explicit aim. Their 
relation to this aim may be quite remote, and the 
chance collocation of events may be of great im- 
portance in. their formation. Yet we can say 
that they are always a result of some aim, whether 
it be primary or subordinate. Without such 
a direction the synthesis of a unified behavior 
involving selection and rejection would not occur. 
58. Voluntary Reaction 
We are now ready to consider the fourth step in 
the synthetic processes of reaction. This com- 
prises the reactions which we term voluntary. 
That which has characterized the reflexive, instinc- 
tive and habitual reactions is their typical invari- 
ability, either with regard to aim or with referenge 
to the serial acts performed. The voluntary reac- 
tions likewise operate upon the motor capacities 
at the disposal of the organism. They are different, 
however, in that they are not automatic, but pos- 
sess a high degree of variability as to their com- 
binations of reaction. This variability is chiefly 
afforded by the skeletal muscles, rather than by 
the glandular and muscular activities of those 
organs which subserve the more vital processes of 
life. Yet even these highly automatic systems are 
not entirely withdrawn from voluntary control. 
Purely mental conditions may influence the activi- 
ties of digestion, circulation and respiration, so that 
many of our physical ailments are due to more or 
or less conscious inhibitions of these life-promoting
-P-A-G-E-190
REACTION 17 
processes. But it is over those muscular reactions 
which are less constant in their periodic activity 
that we have the most direct voluntary control. 
We therefore call them ‘voluntary muscles’. These 
are chiefly of the limbs, trunk and head. It is 
by their aid that we adjust ourselves to the en- 
vironmental situation as it presents itself to us in 
constantly varying ways. 
A great deal of detailed thought and speculation 
has been devoted to the question of man’s freedom 
in initiating these reactions. While this is not a 
question that psychology is at present prepared 
to answer, it is one of great philosophic importance. 
Since any solution to be offered must be consistent 
with the psychological facts of the case, it is evident 
that these facts are worthy of a most accurate 
study. It is only within the last few years that 
such detailed studies of volition have been under- 
taken in the psychological laboratories, and not 
yet has the ground been completely and adequately 
covered. Prior to this, psychological theories of 
volition had been either speculative or more largely 
concerned with the reaction than with its motiva- 
tion. Now, at length, we are coming to a more 
accurate understanding of these two phases in their 
joint operation. The most striking result thus 
far achieved came out independently in the investi- 
gations of Professors Ach and Michotte. It con- 
sists in the detection in all voluntary activities of 
what Professor Ach has called an ‘actual moment’. 
This is described by the phrase “I will actually”,
-P-A-G-E-191
172 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
which indicates the clear consciousness of a sub- 
jectively determined reaction. The “7” appears 
as the cause of the reaction, and in the absence of 
such a conscious egoistic direction, is found the 
differentia specifica which sets off non-voluntary 
from voluntary reactions. 
Here, then, is a basis for philosophical considera- 
tion relative to the freedom of the will. But the 
problem is not solved definitely in favor of indi- 
vidual freedom until we know more concerning 
the nature of the ‘ego’ which ‘causes’ these acts. 
The data at hand do not enable us to proceed at 
once to a satisfactory analysis of the ego, and we 
shall therefore postpone our consideration of it 
until we are prepared to take up, in Part IV, the 
general issues which our analytic and synthetic 
facts have furnished us. 
A voluntary reaction is, then, one in which 
muscular coérdinations and inhibitions of the most 
variable sort are brought into play. It is further- 
more a reaction which is initiated by a character- 
istic moment of egoistic direction. I, myself, 
am actuating the process. The direction is not 
blind, but conscious in its activity. This con- 
sciousness of a self-determined act is a unique 
moment, such as does not appear in any other form 
of mental happening. 
59. Indirect Reaction 
These four types of reaction, which, in a measure, 
form an evolutionary series, each step being de-
-P-A-G-E-192
REACTION — 173 
pendent upon the preceding steps, sum up the 
organic possibilities of reaction. But before leav- 
ing this division of our inquiry we must endeavor 
to understand some of the ways in which these 
different forms of reaction interplay in the life 
of the mature man. 
We have already noted that life-activities, as 
they express themselves in the various forms of 
behavior, constitute the ground for an objective 
study which may embrace all living organisms. 
But we have dissented from the view that this study 
is the true scientific basis for psychology. On 
the contrary, we have maintained that the imme- 
diate psychological data are to be found in expe- 
rience, and not in physical behavior, however 
important this latter fact may be for an accurate 
knowledge of mentality. We have also argued 
that the study of behavior, as a closed system of 
reaction-states initiated by sensory stimulation, 
gives us but an incomplete picture of the real 
causes operative in behavior. It has appeared 
from our arguments that without the postulation 
of purposive tendencies which, while at times 
unconscious, are nevertheless the active agents 
by whose means experience is synthesized and di- 
rected, we should be limited to a mechanistic 
conception of all human processes. But this ill 
accords with the facts as we know them. 
Granting that consciousness may intervene be- 
tween the external stimulation of the organism and 
its motor adjustment, the questions arise: Does
-P-A-G-E-193
174 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
all consciousness issue in motor acts? or, may it 
sometimes proceed without reaching a motor terminal? 
We cannot at present answer. The theory of mind 
which accentuates behavior tends strongly to the 
first-named assumption. It is, of course, undeni- 
able that the living organism exhibits a constantly 
varying behavior, the antecedents of which may 
in part be conscious. But this fact does not pre- 
clude the possibility of conscious processes that 
do not issue in motor reactions. An invariable 
connection between conscious process and motor 
process is, therefore, not demonstrated by the 
continuity of behavior in the organism. Neither 
is it necessary that we should reach such a conclu- 
sion from the study of the nervous system. This 
teaches us only that the brain-paths afford a vast 
number of motor discharges, but there is nothing 
to hinder the assumption that some nervous activ- 
ities within a total group may expend their force 
entirely in the central nervous system and thus 
never reach a motor terminal. 
The question is not, however, a pressing one 
for us to decide, On either assumption, we must 
grant that some processes are relatively direct in 
their motor response, while others are very indirect. 
In the latter case, we find incipient discharges 
occasioning many reactions which are tentative, 
or at least not immediately adjustive, together with 
an accompanying experience of kinesthesis. 
In this group of indirect reactions are to be found 
many that are of the greatest value to us, though
-P-A-G-E-194
REACTION I75 
they appear of comparative insignificance as phys- 
ical events. 
1. Language 
The communicative expressions forming the basis 
of language are reactions of this sort. They in- 
clude gestures, sound-utterances, and all those 
complicated activities by means of which we are 
able to express and communicate our ideas to 
others. The feature of prime importance is not 
so much the adequacy of the motor response in its 
immediate effect upon environmental conditions, 
as its representational and symbolic value. In 
their origin these reactions have root in the same 
motor capacities we have already discussed. It 
is because of their usefulness as agencies of com- 
munication that they differentiate themselves in 
their process of development from the more direct 
phases of adaptive adjustment. An animal finding 
itself in a critical situation is excited to motor 
reactions of the most diverse character, among 
which are those resulting in the utterance of sounds, 
such as cries and howls. These are of greater 
service for communication at a distance, than the 
movements which are more directly adaptive. 
They may, therefore, be regarded as possessing a 
peculiar survival-value. Language seems to evolve 
largely from this fact. But it is noteworthy that 
in the animal kingdom below man, the devel- 
opment of this order of reaction is comparatively 
slight. Many have regarded this as an indication
-P-A-G-E-195
176 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
that animals other than man-do not think, since 
thinking is so closely allied with linguistic expres- 
sion. This conclusion is, however, not fully 
justified, since, as we have seen, thinking is not a 
mere matter of expressional activity, but depends 
rather on the capacity to form notions, and this 
capacity, so far as we can tell, reaches back to the 
very beginnings of conscious life. Yet there can 
be no doubt that thinking is greatly aided by the 
ability of representational or symbolic expression. 
Without this ability, the organism can be regarded 
as thinking only in so far as it is engaged in active 
adjustment to its environment. The development 
of linguistic symbols goes hand in hand with those 
needs of the organism that transcend the imme- 
diate environmental conditions. We are thus 
able to give expression to our revived experiences 
and work them over into new syntheses which will 
be of use in the future. 
But it is a mistake to regard an individual’s 
thinking as entirely and adequately expressed in 
his reactions. What we know is often much more 
than we are able to express. The process of 
education must emphasize both accretion of knowl- 
edge and ability of expression. The two should 
be related in the most intimate manner. Yet the 
fact remains that the two processes are not identical. 
We have already shown that it is quite conceivable 
that a conscious process should play out in the 
higher centres of the brain without ever reaching 
a motor outlet. If such processes be also regarded
-P-A-G-E-196
REACTION 177 
as. reactions, their end-results would usually, 
perhaps always, be imaginal. But they would not 
consist exclusively of images, for the more frequent 
terminal result would be an idea which is at once 
imaginal, notional and relational. This, in turn, 
must find expression in. words, gestures or pictures 
before it can be communicated to others. 
In these reactions, it matters little what their 
exact motor nature may be, provided the result 
is understood. To be sure, the specific reactions 
do not arise in an arbitrary manner. We have al- 
ready noted the peculiar survival-value of sound- 
utterances for communication. It is also highly 
probable that certain general types of symbolic 
response — for instance, those which are affec- 
tively agreeable or disagreeable — are directly de- 
termined by fundamental organic conditions. Yet 
we all know that despite many typical likenesses 
there are also wide differences in the linguistic 
developments of different peoples. Even in the 
case of gesture-language, there exists a great di- 
versity of forms to express the same thought or 
intention. It might appear that nodding the head 
forward is a most natural mode of expressing as- 
sent. Yet among the Greek peasants, assent is 
indicated by a sharp backward movement of the 
head. Certain words, such as mama, papa, baby and 
the like, seem to be more or less in use in all lan- 
guages. This is attributable to the fact that these 
articulations are among the earliest forms which 
the speech-organs permit. But the definite asso-
-P-A-G-E-197
178 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
ciation of such primitively natural types of expres- 
sion with specific meanings that can serve as a 
basis for further linguistic development, is still 
a problem which seems to involve many more or 
less fortuitous and arbitrary conditions. 
2. Imitation 
Imitation is usually regarded as a prominent 
feature in the development of speech-reactions, 
as well as in many other phases of the learning- 
process. 
It appears to be one of the most evident types 
of behavior among animals and children, and is 
doubtless based upon an instinct. Self-imitation, 
or the serial repetition of an action, seems to be 
a natural thing, which can be readily attributed 
to physiological mechanisms. But the imitation 
of others affords a problem not so readily solved. 
Imitation of this sort consists in the capacity to 
react in a manner approximating the behavior of 
the object perceived. This would seem to indicate 
that perception involves motor tendencies which 
lead to a direct duplication of the type of behavior 
presented in the stimulus. Thus, the facial expres- 
sion of a person speaking is often directly imitated 
by the listener. 
Sympathetic response of this order is a conspicu- 
ous fact of behavior. It is not limited to a con- 
scious endeavor to copy the acts of another. The 
imitator is often quite unconscious of his response.
-P-A-G-E-198
REACTION 179 
Furthermore, imitation is not restricted to the 
behavior of other living beings, but extends as 
well to inanimate objects. 
An important phenomenon based upon this 
general tendency to imitate is known as empathy. 
This is a conscious, affective mode of projecting 
oneself into the object perceived. One feels 
oneself flying with the bird, striving upwards 
with the tower, or flattened out with the level 
plain. 
The sense of empathy is not necessarily involved 
in imitation, because imitative reactions may be 
quite direct and unconscious. But the imitative 
instinct is unquestionably the foundation for em- 
pathy. Without this unconscious tendency to 
duplicate the characteristic pose or bearing of an 
object, there would be no basis for the conscious 
feeling of identity with the object which empathy 
affords. . 
This tendency to project the self into one’s sur- 
roundings is, however, not identical with conscious 
imitation. Here we have to deal with the solution 
of a definite problem. In learning to drive a golf- 
ball, the conscious effort to duplicate the muscular 
coérdinations of the instructor does not usually 
lead at once to a successful performance. Indeed, 
we often note in such cases that when success is 
achieved it appears to come as a matter of chance. 
We ‘hit upon’ the correct codrdination rather than 
intend it. 
This fact reveals the difference between in-
-P-A-G-E-199
180 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
stinctive and consciously directed imitation. It 
sometimes appears as though our conscious efforts 
interfered with the natural response evoked by the 
situation. Of course, we need not suppose that our 
innate capacities would make it possible for us to 
imitate correctly a complex series of actions the 
first time. Nor is our conscious effort the only 
thing which stands in the way of a successful per- 
formance. Yet something of this sort does happen. 
The imitative instinct acts, so far as its capacities 
warrant, in a direct and automatic fashion. Bring- 
ing the instinct under the control of the will results 
in much the same kind of spasmodic and ineffectual 
response as does a conscious effort to control each 
step in walking. 
As to the extent of our imitative capacities, very 
little is known. Some think that it is considerable, 
and thus find imitation at the root of numerous 
acquired abilities. Others are more sceptical, 
even to the point of denying that imitation is 
instinctive. They regard the typically direct, 
unconscious, imitative response as based upon ho- 
mogeneity of needs. They maintain that typical 
situations bring typical responses in all the members 
of a species. Itis the uniformity of human or ani- 
mal nature which provides these apparent approx- 
imations in subjective and objective behavior. 
We are not, they think, justified in assuming any 
necessary correspondence between a percept and 
a motor response which tends to duplicate the 
action perceived.
-P-A-G-E-200
REACTION 181. 
Before this question can be settled, more experi- 
mental data must be secured, but the present trend 
of our observations favors the belief that imitation 
is a true instinctive tendency, however limited its 
capacities may be. 
3. Play 
Play-activities are an important source of behav- 
ior-development. These are in a large measure 
instinctive, and represent partial adaptations to 
the fundamental needs of organic life. They arise 
also, in part, from the sheer restlessness of animal 
life. But for these constant and repeated reactions 
in the earlier stages of physical growth, the organ- 
ism would be unable to fit itself adequately for the 
more critical activities demanded by its nature. 
Instinctive determinations bring about codrdinated 
reactions. A constant physical growth and de- 
velopment, anticipative of later needs, is thus 
made possible. We refer to these activities as 
play when the purpose they appear to serve is 
not an urgent demand. But it is not evident that 
the little girl playing with her doll is impelled by 
a force essentially different from that which causes 
a mother to perform acts of service to her child. 
The urgency of the need in the two cases is a purely 
relative affair. The instinct leading the little girl 
to play with dolls may be regarded as the same 
instinct of motherliness which in later years will 
guide her in the more critical situations of real 
motherhood. ,

182 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
60. Summary 
We have mentioned but a few of the character- 
istic reactions which go to make up the behavior- 
aspect of mental happenings. Yet our limited 
discussion may serve to indicate the place of reac- 
tion in a general psychology, and its importance in 
realizing the demands of experience. The conclu- 
sion we reach is that the intervention of con- 
sciousness between the receptive excitation and 
the motor response is a real agency for synthetic 
coérdination of both the conscious data of experi- 
ence and the ensuing reactions. These receptive and 
these motor capacities are inherent in the physio- 
logical nature of the organism. It is, however, the 
fact of selective and directive behavior which gives 
evidence of a growth and progress without counter- 
part in the realm of inorganic activities.

CHAPTER XIV 
EMOTION 
61. General Considerations 
HERE remains for our consideration a sixth 
synthetic fact, and with it we may conclude 
our study of mental capacity and ability. This 
fact is generally designated as emotion, by which 
we shall mean the affective syntheses of experience. 
We have had little to say of affection since we 
described it as an elemental content of conscious- 
ness. We must not conclude from this, however, 
that affection has had no part to play in the various 
synthetic processes with which we have been en- 
gaged. On the contrary, there are no mental 
happenings, — perceptual, ideational or reactive — 
that may not be affectively toned. But it has 
seemed best, since it is possible to experience these 
various syntheses in a setting of affectional indif-’ 
ference, to reserve our consideration of the affective 
syntheses until now. This reservation appears 
desirable when we consider the dependency of affec- 
tion upon the other mental contents and activities — 
which any situation presents. Affection we found 
to be always an aciwal and never a reflected or 
tevived state of consciousness. Although there 
is a possibility that it may manifest itself as an in- 
dependent element and thus take its place in the 
course of experience on the same level with the 
sensations, images and thoughts, this has not yet
-P-A-G-E-203
184 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
been clearly shown to be true. Affection usually 
stands synthetically in most intimate relationship 
with the perceptual and ideational processes we 
have described. Indeed, so far as we are able 
to trace the affective syntheses, we find them 
to be always conditioned by the dispositional, 
perceptual, ideational and reactive syntheses which 
they attend. 
Thus the dispositional characteristics of a person 
are responsible for his moods. These constitute 
an affective coloring, pleasant or unpleasant, which, 
while not permanent, may nevertheless continue 
for periods of a day or week. They are usually cor- 
related with habits, because they appear to be ac- 
quired in the course of experience. Temperament, 
similarly, designates fixed and permanent tenden- 
cies of affective tone. These are, in part at least, 
instinctive, and form the foundation of what we 
term individuality. They appear early in life and 
continue with great persistency. There can be no 
question but that such tendencies as these are in- 
timately dependent upon the codrdination of the 
most varied factors, — physical, physiological and 
mental. Individuality and disposition are, indeed, 
in large measure affective tendencies, partly innate, 
and partly acquired. The perceptual units bring 
into play affective syntheses which are, to a con- 
siderable extent, attributable to the nature of the 
relations established within the percepts them- 
selves; but these affective syntheses may also reach 
beyond the perceptual content to the individual
-P-A-G-E-204
EMOTION 185 
peculiarities and disposition of the perceiver. Idea- 
tional units, in turn, occasion affective phenomena, 
alike independent of other facts, and expressive of 
the larger aspects of the total mental situation. 
Mental activity as such is the source of the feelings 
of empathy, which we have already mentioned in 
discussing imitation. The affective side of this 
fact of experience is not readily analyzable. But 
it is here mentioned as a typical instance of an 
affective synthesis founded chiefly upon a mental 
activity, and providing us with an intimate sense 
of relationship to our environment. Finally, reac- 
tions of all sorts are a fruitful source of affectional 
syntheses, as is evident from the difficulties we find 
in clearly differentiating our feelings from the 
kinesthetic and organic sensations which result 
from motor and glandular reactions of the body. 
We can indicate these general features of affection 
by aid of a formula which Professor Kiilpe has 
given us: 
A=f[L, D,E (s,c,a), R (i, m)] 
Affection thus appears as a function of individual- 
ity (I), disposition (D), excitation (E); whether it 
be a sensory stimulus (s), a content (c), of any 
order, or a mental act (a); and reaction (R), either 
ideational (i) or motor (m). 
A few words will be appropriate here concern- 
ing the definition of Individuality and Disposition. 
By individuality we mean the total aspect of a 
being as an initiator of mental processes, whether
-P-A-G-E-205
186 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
these be conscious (with or without egoistic direc- 
tion) or unconscious. It thus appears to be a 
wider concept than personality, which may be de- 
scribed as self-conscious individuality. It embraces 
individual differences, and is the basis of character. 
Individuality expresses itself through dispositional 
capacities and abilities latent in the psychophysi- 
cal organism. Disposition, therefore, consists in 
tendencies based upon habit and instinct which are 
revealed in the expressions of individuality. We 
shall discuss Personality and Character at greater 
length in Part IV. 
62. Three Groups of Affective Syntheses 
The formula given above makes it clear how 
wide-reaching and various are the conditions of 
. the affective syntheses. We can distinguish three 
groups of affective syntheses which operate within 
this general setting: — 
1. Particular and Common Feelings 
We have the particular and the common feelings. 
On the one hand, there are the relatively simple 
feelings which attach to separable contents, — 
sensations, and percepts, — images, thoughts and 
ideas. On the other hand, there are the com- 
mon feelings, which are more inclusive and general, 
attaching themselves to mental activities and at 
times appearing to color the entire stream of con- 
sciousness. ‘Mixed’ feelings are explained by this 
distinction. While the total or common feeling is
-P-A-G-E-206
EMOTION 187 
pleasant, the particular contents may be of varying 
sorts, pleasant and unpleasant. This fact furnishes 
the key to certain difficulties raised in our con- 
sideration of affection as an element of conscious- 
ness. The query was then made: How cana tragic 
situation be artistically agreeable? The answer is 
that separable contents may retain their unpleasant 
feeling-tone, while a synthesis of the whole is 
secured by artistic means in a manner that is 
pleasant. Such syntheses also account for the 
tendency of our interest, which is a pleasant feeling, 
to attach itself to situations that can be analyzed 
into possibly disagreeable particulars. 
2, Active and Passive Feelings 
We have active and passive feelings accompany- 
ing conditions of excitement or quiescence, both 
mental and bodily.’ Pleasantness and unpleasant- 
ness may attend either sort. The character of 
the synthetic product depends upon the nature 
of the mental happenings as a whole, with special 
reference to the directive acts which are operating. 
In speaking of mental happenings as active and 
passive, we must, of course, bear in mind that such 
a distinction is purely relative. All experience is 
essentially dynamic, yet a distinction can be made 
between simple presentations, the occasion for 
which is primarily objective, and the appearance 
of contents and activities which are subjectively 
directed. The feclings that attach to these two 
classes emphasize this distinction, and justify the
-P-A-G-E-207
188 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
use of ‘passivity’ and ‘activity’ to describe the 
difference of attitude involved. 
3. Shock and Mood 
We have feelings of shock, which are sudden and 
fleeting, and feelings of mood or humor, which are 
slow-rising and relatively enduring, thus constitut- 
ing an affective tone, or ‘frame of mind’. These 
syntheses have a close relationship to those of the 
first class, but they are not identical, since the dif- 
ferentiation in the first instance was that of the 
partial to the whole process. Here, it is the nature 
of the temporal aspect which furnishes the basis 
for synthesis. It is evident that not all particular 
feelings are in the nature of shocks, and not all 
common feelings indicate a frame of mind. 
63. Synthetic Types: (1) The Sentiments 
From another point of view, we can distinguish 
two large classes of affective syntheses, which in- 
volve in various degrees the three groups just 
enumerated. These may be designated as senti- 
ments and feelings of agitation. The latter class is 
commonly referred to by psychologists as emotion. 
The use of this term, however, in ordinary dis- 
course is more general than the one thus implied. 
We have, therefore, taken it as a general designation 
for all affective syntheses. 
By sentiments we mean common feelings, either 
active or passive, which are also enduring, and thus 
constitute a frame of mind. There are intellectual
-P-A-G-E-208
EMOTION 189 
or logical sentiments, which attach to our reasoning 
processes; there are esthetic sentiments, which at- 
tach to our appreciative moments; there are moral 
or ethical sentiments, which attach to our volun- 
tary conduct; and there are religious sentiments. 
That which permits us to class these four diverse 
types of experience under a common head is the 
principle of conformity or non-conformity in experi- 
ence. Sentiments arise from common feelings, 
attaching to experiences in which the formative 
aspect is prominent. The integration of mental 
happenings into a conformable whole may be ef- 
fected by various and diverse means, but there is 
always an element of conscious direction manifest. 
This makes the result a peculiarly intimate and 
highly organized experience. 
Among the various conditions giving rise to 
sentiments are certain mental processes which 
may be described as economical. These occasion 
conscious conformities, both perceptual and idea- 
tional, which result from instinctive and habitual 
tendencies. Thus we find certain relationships 
existing among tones, colors, linear dimensions, 
shapes and sizes, odors, tastes, cutaneous experi- 
ences and the like, that seem to render them imme- 
diately conformable in their sheer sensory nature. 
We may describe such facts as giving evidence of 
a mental economy, because their main character- 
istic appears in the facility with which they fit into 
the perceptual units of which they form a part. 
While in large measure they are the result of fre-
-P-A-G-E-209
Igo THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
quent experience and may, therefore, be called 
habitual tendencies, they are also, many of them, 
original so far as we can judge, and require no re- 
peated occurrence to be adequately formed. We 
do not have to learn to enjoy the touch of soft 
and smooth objects, or to dislike rough and un- 
yielding surfaces. Sweet tastes and fragrant odors 
are immediately preferable to bitter tastes and 
fetid smells. Among spatial percepts, even lines, 
whether straight or curved, are more acceptable 
than broken and irregular contours. Proportion 
seems also to be in some measure founded upon 
economy of mental process. Equals are more 
favored than unequals. The balanced and sym- 
metrical are immediately detected and preferred 
to unbalanced and unsymmetrical forms. In color- 
combinations we favor the complementaries, or 
the closely related intermediates, rather than cer- 
tain of the wider differences found in the color- 
series. As for sounds, we have already noted the 
perceptual units afforded by rhythm. Similar 
rhythmic units occur also in the other fields of 
sense. The tonal relationships, which have been 
mentioned as the foundation of music, afford a 
still more striking example of conformities based 
upon mental economy. These occasion both the 
tonal fusions of concordance and the lack of 
fusion which results in discordance. Such an 
economy is also apparent in the relationships of 
successive tones, — the ease of transition from one 
tone to another near it in pitch, Other examples
-P-A-G-E-210
— 
TT EMOTION 1gr 
are furnished in music by the effect of terminal 
resolution: —the demand for the keynote in a 
melodic sequence is well known. A somewhat 
analogous but differently based demand is that 
of the ‘falling inflection’. We seem to end a series 
of sounds more satisfactorily on a low pitch than 
on a high one. This is evident in speech as well 
as in music. 
‘All these facts are partly based upon habit. 
Many of them, however, are more deeply seated, 
being bound up with the sensory mechanisms. 
The common feature is that they present us with 
perceptual units which evidence facility of men- 
tal activity in the presence, and lack of facility 
in the absence, of certain fundamental relations. 
They are, therefore, the immediate occasion of an 
affective tone, either pleasant or unpleasant. Such 
an affective tone may or may not arise in the © 
experience, yet the possibility at least is afforded 
for the arousal of a sentiment. 
But it is not merely these sensory conformities 
and non-conformities which underlie our sentiments. 
Purely ideational units complying with frequent 
aims and desires, or showing marked discrepancies 
with our usual mental processes, are also adequate 
bases for sentiments in reasoning and reflection. 
Taken by themselves, these evidences of mental 
economy, or its opposite, furnish only occasional 
feelings, such as are sufficiently accounted for by 
the categories of particular and common feelings, 
active and passive feelings, shocking and enduring
-P-A-G-E-211
Tg2 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
feelings. But they also constitute a basis, both 
perceptual and ideational, for a higher synthesis 
of affection, in which our whole being seems filled 
with a sense of the conformity or non-conformity 
of the situation. It is these feelings that we de- 
note as sentiments. Oftentimes they are based 
upon intuitions. We have intuitions of truth and 
falsity, beauty and ugliness, morality and immoral- 
ity. The religious experience of exaltation and 
dejection, mystical and sublime, is also in part in- 
tuitive. The significance of intuition consists in 
its apparent directness. Thus we are furnished 
with a foundation for belief on the immediate basis 
of dispositional tendencies. Being filled with such 
a powerful and assuring sentiment, we do not search 
for inferential grounds to substantiate it, but ac- 
cept it at once, and act accordingly. All our be- 
liefs may be regarded as having something of an 
intuitional sentiment attaching to them, but al- 
though direct in their appearance, they are founded 
on all manner of past experiences, some parts of 
which have been quite uncritical and others highly 
critical. A belief is therefore an ideational syn- 
thesis to which is attached an intuitive sentiment, 
the exact nature of the intuition being dependent 
upon the type of individuality and education we 
possess. 
1. Logical Sentiments 
We may now refer briefly to the four groups of 
sentiments which we have distinguished. In the
-P-A-G-E-212
EMOTION 193 
first group of logical sentiments, we have referred to 
the feelings which color active reasoning processes. 
No passive feelings are found in this group, 
since the process of reasoning is in its nature active. 
It is, however, as already noted, impossible to draw 
a hard and fast line between active and passive 
states. But the sentiments which occur in the 
course of reasoning are only occasioned by the ap- 
pearance of peculiarly conformable or non-con- 
formable ideas. These occasion the excitement 
which is a necessary constituent of the sentiment. 
For the most part, our reasoning proceeds in a 
condition of affectional indifference. It is when 
we meet with obstacles in the procedure of our ar- 
gument that sentiments of dissatisfaction appear, 
while the occurrence of an illuminating thought 
of wide perspective may occasion a sentiment of 
satisfaction quite in contrast with the ordinary dis- 
passionate processes of the rational mind. Logical 
sentiments may approach the order of shocks in 
the suddenness of their appearance, but they can 
also be aroused gradually, and are usually of some 
appreciable duration. 
2. Aisthetic Sentiments , 
The esthetic sentiments form a group offering 
much larger possibilities for investigation, into the 
details of which, however, we shall be unable to 
enter. As a general subject-matter, A‘sthetics, 
like Logic, belongs to the issues of psychology rather 
than to the synthetic aspects of affection. Yet it
-P-A-G-E-213
194 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
is much more directly dependent upon its sentimen- 
tal phases than is Logic, and therefore demands a 
somewhat closer examination. 
The esthetic sentiment attaches itself to non- 
voluntary experiences, and is based upon percep- 
tual and ideational conformities. It is always a 
common feeling of some endurance, and may be 
either active or passive. 
To its active phases we may refer the attitude of 
the creative artist. To its passive phases belongs the 
receptive attitude of the observer who appreciates 
the finished product. The differentiation of active 
and passive attitude is not, however, confined to 
the behavior of the creative artist and the observer. 
Active and passive attitudes may succeed each 
other both in artistic production and in the recep- 
tive state of appreciation. There are moments of 
esthetic calm and moments of esthetic excitement. 
These sentiments arise chiefly from the appre- 
hension of certain perceptual conformities which 
we have described as being based upon economical 
mental activities. The peculiar facilities which 
occur in the perception of certain sensory con- 
tents are an important source of esthetic appre- 
ciation. There are the spatial forms indicating 
symmetry and proportion. There are lines, tex- 
tures, colors, which are psychophysically adequate 
for securing this sentiment. Furthermore, there is 
the temporal form of rhythm, and all the mani- 
fold phenomena of sound which play so large 
a part in the creation of music and poetry. A
-P-A-G-E-214
aS 
 —— EMOTION 195 
prominent feature of the esthetic sentiment as 
aroused in perception is its empathic character. 
Empathy is not restricted to the esthetic attitude, 
nor has it been shown to be an invariable attri- 
bute of it. It is, however, in this connection that 
it is most often noted and described. 
But the sentiment is not limited to perception. 
Asthetic ideas also play an important réle, not 
only in conjunction with perceived objects, but 
apart from these in the course of intellectual pur- 
suits and the flights of imagination. To describe 
the range of the esthetic sentiment would neces- 
sitate a more detailed study of the zsthetic state 
than we are here prepared to make. We may 
note, however, that it varies from the appreciation 
of the comic, at one extreme, to the contemplation 
of the sublime, at the other. 
Strictly speaking, an esthetic sentiment is al- 
ways a pleasant affection. A common feeling of 
displeasure is never esthetic, though it may be 
consequent upon an esthetic attitude, and thus 
pair with it as its affectional opposite. But it is 
possible to synthesize into an esthetic whole many 
diverse factors which in themselves occasion par- 
ticular feelings of displeasure; and this is done, it 
should be noted, without altering the quality of 
these separable affective contents. It is thus that 
we can appreciate in a positive manner the tragic 
as well as the comic situations of life, and, as modern 
artists are learning to realize, there are immense 
artistic possibilities in the interpretative represen-
-P-A-G-E-215
196 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
.tation of facts that are individually ugly and even 
distressing. 
3. Moral Sentiments 
Moral sentiments attach themselves to certain 
lines of voluntary conduct. These are social ac- 
tivities which aim chiefly at justice and good- 
ness. The conformities here apprehended are 
always self-initiated, and involve definite types 
of behavior. 
Moral sentiments always arise from common 
feelings. They are always active, but may be either 
brief and shock-like, or slow-rising and enduring. 
They are both pleasant and unpleasant, according 
to the conformity or non-conformity of the situa- 
tion involved. 
4. Religious Sentiments 
The sentiments arising with the religious attitude 
have a peculiar poignancy. They are founded 
on common feelings, are either active or pas- 
sive, shock-like or enduring, and they indicate all 
nuances of pleasantness and unpleasantness. This 
latter fact indicates a differentiation from the 
zesthetic sentiments, which, a8 we saw, are essen- 
tially pleasant. Religious dejection is, however, 
too real an experience to be regarded as but a par- 
tial content in a larger synthesis of joy. The con- 
templation of God runs the gamut of our total 
affective states, and the sentiments involved 
are varied, such as awe and reverence, power and 
weakness.
-P-A-G-E-216
EMOTION 197 
64, Synthetic Types: (2) Feelings of Agitation 
There remain for our consideration the feelings 
of agitation, or emotions, in the more restricted 
sense of that term. These are distinguishable 
from the sentiments we have been discussing by 
the special nature of the reactions to which they 
are attached. The situation giving rise to an 
emotional outburst is one in which an adequate 
adjustment is impossible. There follows a more 
or less chaotic series of impulses, involving instinc- 
tive and habitual types of reaction, and reflecting 
a mass of kinesthetic and organic sensations which 
fuses with our percepts and ideas to form the basis 
of these characteristic feelings of agitation. Anger, 
rage, resentment, passionate love, joy, sorrow and 
the like are the states resulting in such instances. 
Pleasure or displeasure is often dominant, though 
not always, for the affective elements may be 
numerous and conflicting. An object or occasion 
for the emotion is always prominent, at least in 
the early stages of the agitation, and the reaction 
is more or less characteristic of the cause. Thus 
the clenched fists and taut muscles of anger con- 
trast with the flabby collapse of poignant grief. 
Many other reactions, however, are more arbitrary 
in their appearance. Blushing and pallor, the 
various disturbances in breathing, those associated 
with the digestive processes, with movements of 
the diaphragm and the cesophagus, are all likely 
to appear in any state of acute agitation. It there-
-P-A-G-E-217
198 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND © 
fore does not seem possible to describe these violent 
affections in terms of certain type-forms of reac- 
tion, with their attendant sensations, as is attempted 
in the theory which bears the names of James and 
Lange. But the contribution to our knowledge of 
emotion which these investigators have made is 
no less real on that account, for it is undoubtedly 
true that without these kinesthetic and organic 
sensations there occurs no feeling of agitation. 
The phenomenon seems to be essentially one of 
‘letting off steam’. With a situation which seizes 
upon our whole being, tendencies are aroused whose 
energy cannot be adequately drained off through 
the ordinary channels of adjustment, either central 
or peripheral. The result is an overflow into those 
channels offering the least resistance. In the 
main, these are the channels most fundamental 
and most frequently in use. The result is a more 
or less violent reaction in glands and muscles, 
many of which are ordinarily automatic in their 
activities. The vaso-motor, the respiratory and 
the digestive tracts furnish, perhaps, the most 
prominent components of these reactions. But 
the voluntary muscles may also be involved, thus 
giving rise to the more typical expressions of the 
different states of agitation, and also inhibiting 
one another until the individual thus seized evi- 
dences, at times, a complete lack of control over 
his behavior. The attention ceases then to be 
focussed upon the object which has caused the 
agitation; the individual is ‘beside himself’, as
-P-A-G-E-218
EMOTION 199 
we say, and a highly affective stream of sensations 
is the very marked content of his experience. 
The feelings of agitation are common feelings. 
They are always active, and usually of the shock- 
variety, rising suddenly to a considerable intensity. 
But they often continue for some time, and may 
be gradual in their appearance. The amount of 
agitation which is aroused varies greatly on different 
occasions. While the typical fully developed agi- 
tation pervades our whole being at the expense 
of all other processes, it is not impossible for it to 
be controlled by a higher synthesis, which subor- 
dinates it to a simultaneously appearing sentiment. 
Thus we often experience complex emotions, 
simultaneously with the zsthetic, moral and re- 
ligious sentiments. In such instances, the back- 
ground feelings of agitation lend a vividness to the 
experience without necessarily disrupting the senti- 
ment superimposed upon it. 
65. The Significance of Emotion 
In concluding our discussion of the affective 
syntheses, mention should be made of the part 
played by affection in mental life as a whole. 
Since practically all our mental operations can be 
performed without affection, what service do they 
render in their seemingly sporadic appearance? 
Many different views are entertained regarding 
this problem. They vary all the way from those 
which see in affective phenomena the most original 
and primitive of mental facts, to those which re-
-P-A-G-E-219
200 THE SYNTHETIC FACTS OF MIND 
gard them as but epiphenomena of no real service- 
value for behavior. 
The position we are justified in taking in view 
of the foregoing discussion is intermediate between 
these two extremes, To assume that pleasure 
and displeasure exist prior to the elements of 
sensation and thought does too great a violence 
to the facts of affective experience as we know 
them, for on such an assumption we should be 
at a loss to understand how these elements 
have evolved, and we should also be obliged to 
accept the independence of affective elements, 
which we have found to be very questionable. 
On the other hand, to regard affection as a mere 
epiphenomenon would stamp our inquiry as in- 
complete, since we should then have no satisfac- 
tory basis for explaining its appearance. 
We have seen that typical emotions attach 
themselves to characteristic reactions in a manner 
which indicates the survival-value of these reac- 
tions, but it is not clear that the feelings are them- 
selves agencies for mental or physical development. 
As has been pointed out, there are serious organic 
disturbances (such as arterio-sclerosis, diabetes 
and tuberculosis) which do not express themselves 
in unpleasant affections, while there are conditions 
_of physical health coincident with unpleasant 
moods, such as regret and disappointment. It 
follows that pleasure and displeasure are the ex- 
pression not only of bodily conditions, but also 
of mental conditions which may be quite remote
-P-A-G-E-220
EMOTION 201 
from our bodily well-being. But if we cannot iden- 
tify these affective states directly with organic 
needs, we can regard them as conducive to re- 
sults that are on the whole beneficial. A pleasant 
affection is thus conducive to a satisfactory fulfil- 
ment of our obligations and may discover a solu- 
tion to our daily problems, while an unpleasant 
affection warns us against dangers and obstacles 
in our paths. As for the exact manner in which 
an affective state may influence mental happenings, 
this is a problem that, with our present knowledge, 
we are unprepared to solve.

CHAPTER XV 
MIND AND BODY 
66. The Directive Tendencies of Mind 
N Part II of our text, we endeavored to ana- 
lyze experience, with the object of determining 
its elements. We found our analysis complete 
in the distinction of four classes: sensation, image, 
affection and thought. These, with their attributive 
aspects, and the physical and physiological facts 
which condition their appearance, furnished us 
with the structure- or content-basis for understand- 
ing the phenomena of consciousness. In Part III 
we \attempted to understand the nature of the fun- 
damdental syntheses in which these facts are brought 
toge ither to constitute the stream of happenings 
we atlesignate as mind. We have described these 
syntheses under six heads: attention, memory, 
per.,teption, ideation, reaction and emotion. In each 
cape, we have found our synthesis to be dependent 
inly part upon unique tendencies, which seem to 
trranscend the limits of a mere assemblage of ele- 
mcjients, even when we are most careful to trace 
iahe influences attributable to the physical and 
physiological conditions of life and experience. 
These tendencies, then, which are termed the 
directions of experience, have become a central 
feature in our explanation of mind. We are, 
therefore, bound to give them some further consid- 
eration as to their nature and origin, in order that
-P-A-G-E-225
206 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
we may be justified in regarding them as scientific 
facts. In what has gone before, we have not done 
this in any complete and systematic manner. We 
have rather assumed the existence of such tenden- 
cies, and have then proceeded to show how they 
operate, in explanation of the fundamental syn- 
theses which our problem made apparent. 
Our procedure was, however, justified by the 
following considerations: (1) The mental activities 
are not always conscious. When they are con- 
scious, they indicate an attitude or a dynamic 
aspect of experience which is not analyzable into 
elements of content. (2) The existence of thefse 
tendencies is often revealed only vuvospecisehs 
as being the logical prerequisite for certain / syn- 
thetic formulations and processes which we sk jould 
otherwise be at a loss to account for. i 
It appears, therefore, proper that we shi ould 
have postponed a more detailed inquiry ine the 
exact nature of these activities, until we could hi ave 
before us the principal synthetic facts from i the 
existence of which they are inferred. We are nq Ww 
in a position to undertake this inquiry, and thé on 
to work forward to certain conclusions regarding th’ e¢ 
nature of mind in its more general aspects. Let it - 
be clearly understood, however, that the inquiry ~ 
which we are now to make must be in large measure 
theoretical. It will consist in a comparison of 
various possibilities, rather than in the clear-cut 
definition of a scientific principle; for while our 
evidence shows that such a principle is indispensable
-P-A-G-E-226
MIND AND BODY 207 
to the operations of mind, it does not, at the present 
stage of our knowledge, indicate the exact and final 
form which this principle will assume. 
67. Their Bearing upon the Relation of Mind 
and Body 
The first question arising in connection with 
these directive tendencies is that regarding their 
nature. We have shown that they may operate 
even when unconscious. Does this mean that they 
are essentially physiological, or are they some- 
thing more than this? At once we are plunged 
into a speculative problem concerning the relation 
of mind and body, and the nature and function 
of the problems which serve as the point. of 
departure for all such directions. If we accept 
one horn of the dilemma, we may argue that a 
complete causal series is operative in all mental 
happenings, its terms being entirely physiological, 
i.e., physico-chemical,. in their nature. What 
appears as a purpose in consciousness is but an 
illusion, for consciousness itself is but a reflection 
or concomitant of material processes, which are 
carried on with the inevitableness of all physical 
activities. 
68. Epiphenomenalism and Parallelism 
A theory of this order is maintained in two 
principal forms. The first regards consciousness 
as a series of epiphenomena, or adjunct reflections 
which have no real bearing upon the underlying
-P-A-G-E-227
208 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
processes that occasion them. There are serious 
objections to such a theory. Not only does it 
seem unwarrantable that we should be called upon 
to renounce as useless that to which we attribute 
the greatest value in life, namely, our conscious 
endeavors, but also it is difficult to understand 
the appearance of these epiphenomena without 
any apparent loss in the energy which occasions 
their origin. A transformed energy is still an 
energy, and while consciousness may be regarded 
as necessarily correlated with and conditioned by 
nervous processes, the epiphenomenon is something 
unique and distinct from the nervous processes. 
Another hypothesis is more often favored. 
This assumes that mind and body have distinct 
but parallel processes. It may be formulated in 
various ways. Sometimes it is regarded as a mere 
_ working hypothesis, the idea being that all con- 
scious processes have a physiological correlate, 
leaving open the question as to whether all physical 
processes have a conscious correlate, with the 
implication that they do not. Thus, the final 
explanation of mind is sought in bodily activities 
which go on even when an adequate conscious 
correlate is not to be found. 
But while this hypothesis may tacitly avoid any 
attempt to account for the parallelism it assumes, 
it cannot escape the problem of explaining this par- 
allelism. Furthermore, one is in constant danger 
of committing the scientific error of attributing to 
unknown causes all things which are not imme-
-P-A-G-E-228
MIND AND BODY 209 
diately revealed by consciousness. Not content 
with this, the parallelistic metaphysician usually 
adopts a monistic theory, in which mind and body 
are regarded as the universally paired manifesta- 
tions of a fundamental metaphysical substance. 
This substance is then regarded either as an ‘un- 
known’, or as a partially known essence, more 
nearly akin to mind than to matter. This latter 
view may be described as spiritualistic monism. 
That such a fundamental substance should not be 
regarded as material is attributable to the diffi- 
culties which we have already encountered in 
the epiphenomenon theory. Metaphysically, it is 
easier to derive matter from mind than to derive 
mind from matter, because mind is the more imme- 
diate datum of the two. Such a spiritualistic 
monism obviates some of the difficulties in the way 
of effecting a union between conscious purpose and 
mechanical causation, and thus carries us to the 
other horn of the dilemma. 
Since the ultimate essence in all things is neither 
the mental nor the physical, as we know them, 
it is conceivable that strict mechanical causality 
is but a half-truth which works with more or less 
exactness, but is, at best, only an arbitrary approx- 
imation applying in some fields of happenings 
and not in others. From this point of view, the 
progress of existence.may be regarded as a com- 
plicated stream in which the interplay of events 
constitutes a causal sequence, without ever entirely 
setting aside the dominant progressive purpose
-P-A-G-E-229
210 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
that informs the whole and gives it its general 
trend. 
The difficulty involved in this view is the one 
which arises from the necessity of regarding all 
things as possessing the double aspect of mental 
and physical. Wherever life manifests itself, there 
is some basis for the assumption of such a union 
of these refractory elements: — the mental and the 
physical, the purposive and the causal. But in 
the realm of inert matter we must draw largely 
upon our imagination to make this view cogent. 
And when we do so, the result shows every evidence 
of that violence which we do to a set of facts when- 
ever we force them to fit a scheme that they 
themselves do not directly warrant. The law of 
strict causality is quite adequate to all the facts 
which inert matter has revealed to us. It is only 
in the realm of life-activities that we find a need 
for something more than this blind interplay of 
energies. 
69. Interaction 
Tf we regard this need as sufficiently well grounded 
to enable us to reject a strictly mechanistic inter- 
pretation of life, we shall be better served by an 
interaction theory. Here we can hold to a 
simple working hypothesis: that what we call 
mind or purpose interacts with what we call matter 
in its mechanically determined relations. In this 
case we do not attempt to decide the metaphysical 
question as to ultimate substance, whether it be
-P-A-G-E-230
MIND AND BODY 211 
one or many, known or unknown. But we do main- 
tain that the mechanistic conception is incomplete, 
for, in addition, there are purposive acts directed 
upon definite aims which are operative, at least, 
in life-activities. The directive tendencies that 
we have been able to trace in mental happenings 
are the expressions of such purposes. While they 
always operate in a mechanical setting, and while 
their physical results are always of the causal 
order, a direction is really given them from without 
this chain of causal events. 
It is with this hypothesis that we shall rest, 
because it appears to be the most adequate one to 
embrace the facts set forth regarding mental life. 
Its advantage over a monistic parallelism, which 
attempts to include purpose in its scope by refer- 
ence to its spiritualistic foundation, is evident from 
the fact that it does not require that every fact 
shall be at once mental and physical. Its chief 
difficulty arises from the seeming contradiction 
offered to the law of the conservation of energy. 
This law has proven itself so variously useful and 
adequate in scientific procedure, that one is natur- 
ally loath to run counter to its fundamental as- 
sumption. Yet we must remember that it is an 
assumption and not a thoroughly demonstrable 
fact. 
It is not, however, certain that the universality 
of this law need be contradicted in order to estab- 
lish the possibility of purposive behavior. The 
law only maintains that the quantity of energy is
-P-A-G-E-231
212 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
finite, and that from that quantity nothing can be 
added or subtracted. Energy exists, however, in 
various forms, potential and kinetic. The prob- 
lem of mind as interacting with a body of energy 
does not necessarily mean a loss or gain in this 
finite quantity, since we need only assume for mind 
a peculiar capacity to direct energies toward defi- 
niteends. The exact conditions for such a workless 
direction are at present quite beyond our knowledge. 
We have as yet no sufficiently adequate concep- 
tion of nervous energies to venture a satisfactory 
hypothesis. Such an hypothesis, however, is not 
impossible, and therefore is not necessarily at vari- 
ance with the known facts. 
70. Summary of the Argument 
To summarize our argument, the dilemma re- 
quires us to accept either a thoroughgoing mechan- 
istic conception, or a conception which provides for 
both mechanical causation and purposive activity. 
While the first-named conception is supreme in the 
physical world, and has many staunch supporters 
in the biological world, it is not satisfactory to 
psychology, since it relegates mind to an anomalous 
position. If we accept this alternative, the origin 
of mind becomes a complete mystery, and we can 
find for it no use whatever. 
The second alternative regards mind as an original 
purposive element, which in some respects tran- 
scends the causal sequence of physical happenings. 
This conception is consistent with the theory of
-P-A-G-E-232
MIND AND BODY 213 
parallelism if we assume that the underlying 
foundation for the corresponding and inseparable 
manifestations of mind and body is in its essential 
nature spiritual, and therefore not subject to the 
law of causation. To make this view complete, 
however, it is necessary at least to maintain that 
every neurosis has its psychosis, and every psy- 
chosis its neurosis. The theory of interaction does 
not require this thoroughgoing correspondence, 
since it maintains that the purposive and causal 
series interact. A direction is thus given to certain 
processes which are in themselves mechanical. In 
addition, conscious thoughts are created, that serve 
as a basis for new directions. 
The directive tendency is the unit of these pur- 
posive acts. It is revealed to us chiefly by its 
results,— in the creative syntheses of thinking 
and action which we have found it impossible to 
reduce to mere associations, based upon past 
experience. The problem now arises concerning 
the point of departure for these tendencies. 
71. The Origin of Directive Tendencies 
In considering this problem, we must remember 
that the synthetic facts we have been studying 
have revealed a considerable complexity in the 
directive aspects of mental happenings. It is not 
with the issue of a single act that we have to 
deal, but rather with a hierarchy of directions 
which in the highest expressions of intelligent 
behavior are finely organized. In this organi-
-P-A-G-E-233
214 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
zation, specific determinants issue not only from 
definite conscious purposes or problems, but also, 
on the one hand, from vague and general trends 
which appear to be rooted in the fundamental 
nature of all living matter, and, on the other hand, 
from more or less fortuitous associative complexes 
which are tried out with reference to their possible 
value in promoting the main purpose in view. 
Many of these determinants provide us with no 
definite knowledge as to where they are leading, 
and yet we know that only one resultant idea or 
achievement can satisfy their demands. 
An illustration of this was furnished the author 
in the course of a series of experiments in 
which the observer was instructed to obtain the 
meaning of a word. The word in this case was 
six, and the experience of the observer was reported 
as follows: — “The word appeared as out of the 
ordinary. There was difficulty in placing it. A 
tendency to give it a concrete reference was noted. 
Several things were tried. There was a tendency 
to associate it with the title of some book. The 
association with The Sign of the Four occurred, 
with the thought that this would not do. Be. 
wilderment ensued while waiting for an image. 
Then came an image of a string of candles as 
if sketched. There were more than three. Then 
the reaction.” After the reaction, the observer 
placed his image by association with the title 
of a series of stories called Short Sixes, these 
referring to a kind of candle, and the image
-P-A-G-E-234
MIND AND BODY 215 
being reproduced from the title-drawing in the 
magazine where the stories appeared. We can 
see here how the direction was established before 
the knowledge as to its outcome had appeared in 
consciousness. It operated as an impersonal and 
indefinite tendency, which finally provoked the 
revival of the image sought. No other image 
could well have satisfied its demands, yet these 
demands were only partially known until after 
the image occurred. 
It is apparently the operation of such tenden- 
cies as these that constitutes the basis for the 
frequent assumptions regarding the vexed ques- 
tion of an ‘unconscious mind’. It is evident that 
the elaborate theories sometimes brought forward 
with reference to mental operations which take 
place below the threshold of consciousness, find 
little or no justification in cases such as the one 
mentioned. We need not suppose that ideas are 
formed in the subconscious realm and that per- 
sonality is a participant in these obscure operations. 
So far as our evidence goes, thoughts and images, 
like sensations and affections, are always in their 
very nature conscious facts. But their appear- 
ance may be directed by activities which are not 
conscious. It is, therefore, not possible in all cases 
to trace the antecedents of these contents in the 
stream of consciousness. 
The directive tendencies appear to have three 
distinct modes of origin, which we are at present 
unable to trace to one single cause. (1) There
-P-A-G-E-235
216 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
are the tendencies rooted in all living matter, 
expressing the fundamental adaptive character- 
istic of organic life. These are to a large extent 
blind gropings, reflected in consciousness only 
by the impulses of a kinzsthetic-notional type 
which may accompany them. Such adaptations 
may be entirely consequent upon physiological 
processes, or they may be, in part, occasioned by 
a spiritual essence, individual or general, trans- 
cending the purely physical operations of material 
forces. (2) There are the tendencies which arise 
from associative complexes. These are often blind, 
and have been. designated as latent adaptations. 
Habitual tendencies thus make themselves evi- 
dent in thinking as well as in action, and are 
tried out with no knowledge on our part either as 
to their inception or outcome. (3) There are the 
egocentric tendencies, in which we are conscious of 
the personal moment as directing the course of our 
thinking and behavior. These are the tendencies 
issuing from the various problems of which we 
have a conscious knowledge. In the case of voli- 
tion we found them to be rooted in something that 
appears to be self-activity, a direct manifestation 
of the ego.
-P-A-G-E-236
CHAPTER XVI 
PERSONALITY: THE EMPIRICAL EGO, 
SLEEP AND DREAMS 
72. The Empirical Ego 
T is now appropriate for us to inquire into. the 
nature of self-consciousness. So far as we 
can know it empirically, the ego is but a complex 
of bodily sensations and affections, which are more 
or less invariable and persistent. The awareness 
of self is largely composed of tactual, kinesthetic 
and organic sensations. Those arising in the 
visceral region appear to be of especial impor- 
tance, since we find that in certain pathological 
cases where visceral sensitivity is absent or de- 
ranged, there are marked disturbances in the in- 
dividual’s sense of personality. He feels that he 
is different and no longer himself. 
But whereas such facts as these indicate the 
close harmony that normally exists between one’s 
bodily sensitivity and one’s personality, they give 
us no basis for understanding the origin of egocen- 
tric direction. These sensory manifestations are 
but the expressions of personality. Even if we re- 
gard them as necessary expressions, and thus deny 
the existence of personality in their complete ab- 
sence, still we are bound to go beyond them in an 
attempt to make cogent the directive tendencies 
which mental happenings evince.
-P-A-G-E-237
218 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
There is no empirical evidence of the ego as the 
originator of these tendencies, yet such an as- 
sumption is necessary, if we accept the directive 
tendencies as real. Self-consciousness is bound up 
in mental activities, especially those which in- 
volve attitudes of feeling and willing. But it has 
been thus far impossible to isolate the ego as a dis- 
tinct element. Yet the discovery of its existence 
as an ‘actual moment’ in the conscious process of 
willing is, at least, a step in the direction of com- 
plete analysis. Further investigations may be ex- 
pected to carry us still nearer to an understanding 
of the ego’s elemental parts. 
We shall not prolong our discussion into the 
metaphysical realm of speculation regarding the 
universe of selves and their relations to one another 
and to God. It is more to our purpose to push 
forward to a consideration of personality as we 
know it in other ways. 
In our second chapter, mention was made of the 
fact that mental happenings are not, as we observe 
them, continuous in their occurrence. Periods of 
sleep and unconsciousness intervene with a certain 
regularity. How are we to regard these interrup- 
tions, and what effect have they upon personality? 
73. Sleep 
Since the facts of consciousness as we know 
them are all synthetic facts, it is not necessary 
that we should regard the unconsciousness of sleep 
or coma as a complete absence of mentality. A
-P-A-G-E-238
PERSONALITY 219 
sufficient cause for these states can be sought in 
a disruption or change in those synthetic forms 
that normally accompany the waking conscious- 
ness. This view is substantiated in many ways 
by a study of the consciousness which immedi- 
ately precedes sleep. When we compose ourselves 
for the night, the quiet surroundings and closed 
eyes present a situation lacking in many of the sen- 
sory stimuli which otherwise prevail. We seem to 
retire within ourselves, and thoughts and images be- 
come the most conspicuous contents of conscious- 
ness. These maintain themselves for a time with 
considerable vividness. It has often been noted 
that imagery, especially of the visual order, pos- 
sesses unusual clearness in these dozing states. 
Some persons, in whose normal experience imagery 
plays but a feeble part, experience in dozing a 
wealth of vivid and highly detailed imagery, such 
as they are quite unable to arouse at will. Direc- 
tive tendencies persist from the day’s work, and 
presage our plans and intentions for the morrow. 
These may for a time hold the attention to an or- 
ganized stream of thought. But gradually such 
directions become less effective. The images asso- 
ciate others more or less irrelevant, and the mind 
wanders from its purposes into the field of uncon- 
trolled fancy. From time to time, we are aroused 
by a self-conscious intention to note the direction 
in which our minds have been wandering, and 
are surprised to find that we cannot recall those 
“twinklings of oblivion”, as Wordsworth calls
-P-A-G-E-239
220 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
them, which we have been experiencing. This 
is our first intimation that the monarchical super- 
vision of a purpose has been set aside, and the as- 
sociative processes have assumed control. The 
experiences were not synthesized, and therefore 
they are beyond our power of recall. It is ap- 
parently at some stage in such a process of mere 
association that sleep steals upon us. The asso- 
ciative bonds are themselves weakened, and when 
a lapse occurs sleep ensues. It would seem to be 
a sudden departure, although in the nature of the 
case, our introspection is highly unreliable. 
These facts furnish us with some evidence for 
our contention that personality depends upon the 
synthetic activities of direction. The empirical 
self, as founded in organic sensations, is still ex- 
istent. Yet it fails to manifest itself as soon as the 
directive agencies are impotent. 
74. Dreams 
In the course of sleep, dreams may occur. These 
are occasioned by partial syntheses, and can be 
regarded as of different origins. Certain directive 
tendencies which past. experience has rendered 
peculiarly insistent are constantly seeking ex- 
pression. Sensory stimuli, which may occur 
fortuitously, furnish a content immediately elab- 
orated by associative imagery and thought, and a 
synthesized experience results. Many such ten- 
dencies are directly traced to the activities of the 
day just closed. These, it has been observed,
-P-A-G-E-240
PERSONALITY 221 
are more often the subsidiary and relatively un- 
important issues than the acts to which most 
energy has been devoted. The trend of thought 
which last occupied the mind before sleep oc- 
curred may pass directly into a dream-state. 
Similarly, morning dreams occurring just before 
awakening often presage the anticipated events of 
the new day. This indicates the reassertion of 
directive tendencies which are important for the 
furtherance of our plans and intentions. The 
dreams of deep sleep are those most often 
involving revivals from the remote past. 
Interesting but not entirely convincing theories 
have been based upon dreams of remote origin 
by Freud, the psychiatrist, and his school. It 
has been contended that suppressed emotional 
experiences of youth and infancy, especially those 
of a sexual nature, leave us with firmly grounded 
desires which are directed upon their fulfilment. 
Whenever the actualities of everyday life are dis- 
counted, it is these ‘complexes’ that rise to the 
surface and seek an expression. 
The dream is thus regarded as the fulfilment of 
a wish or desire, and since the fulfilment is only 
partially effected through the associated ideas 
clustering about it, it remains a sort of obses- 
sion of which we never can quite rid ourselves 
until the expression is complete in a fully conscious 
process realizing all the bearings of the attendant 
symbolic associates. When such obsessions obtain 
the upper hand in our waking lives, various de-
-P-A-G-E-241
222 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
rangements, such as hysteria, result. Their cure 
is sometimes effected by a careful analysis of the 
dreams and their symbolic importance, in cases 
where it is possible by this means to unroll the 
entire history of the ‘complex’ before the pa- 
tient. Considerable success has attached to this 
method of procedure. There can be no doubt 
that all of us are to some extent subject to such 
obsessions, which lie in wait for expression when- 
ever a lapse occurs in the continuity of rational 
experience. But our knowledge does not warrant 
us in assuming that ‘complexes’ are the sole causes 
of our dreams, and that obsessions are all of a sexual 
origin, however important that order may be. 
A second possibility of the origin of dreams is 
found in the action of a sensory stimulus which 
may occasion its own directive tendency, without 
reference to the special aims of waking life, either 
near or remote. Such dreams as these often 
possess a high degree of strangeness. They are 
creative and fanciful in a measure which makes it 
appear impossible to trace associative connections 
with our past lives. 
We cannot estimate with accuracy the duration 
of dream-states, or the exact time of their occur- 
rence. It is probable that they may occur at any 
time during sleep, and there is some evidence for 
supposing that we dream constantly. The dreams 
we most often remember are those which take 
place in the moments of awakening, and it has 
been shown that very complicated ideas can
-P-A-G-E-242
PERSONALITY 223 
be then experienced in a much shorter time than 
one would ordinarily suppose possible. 
It appears, then, that personality is in some meas- 
ure affected by sleep, owing to the temporary in- 
activity of the directive tendencies. But directive 
tendencies are ready to put in an appearance 
whenever expressive material is presented. Per- 
sonality may, therefore, persist even in the most 
fantastic of dreams. Whether it ever lapses en- 
tirely is a question we are not yet prepared to 
answer. It is evident, however, that the self 
which reappears when we awake is the same self 
which was at the helm when we became lost in 
slumber.
-P-A-G-E-243
CHAPTER XVII 
PERSONALITY: HYPNOSIS, MULTIPLE 
PERSONALITY, TELEPATHY AND 
SPIRITISM 
75. Hypnosis 
NOTHER instance of disruption in person- 
ality is afforded by the phenomenon of hyp- 
nosis. Authorities have long disputed whether 
this is to be regarded as a pathological or a normal 
fact. In its extreme manifestations it is decidedly 
abnormal, yet it also presents features which may 
be recognized in an average everyday life. At the 
foundation of all hypnotic states lies suggestion. 
By suggestion we mean susceptibility to directive 
tendencies arising from impersonal rather than from 
personal facts. It is not self-activity which we 
designate as suggestive, but activity due to agen- 
cies that seem to be independent of ourselves. 
The tendencies rooted in the aims and purposes 
fundamental to existence interplay, as has been 
seen, with data supplied by extraneous conditions 
independent of will. Whenever such facts take 
hold on and dominate one’s activity, they may be 
said to be suggestive. It is the question whether 
such suggestions are or are not assimilated and 
subordinated to one’s personal aims, that deter- 
mines whether or not one is hypnotized by them. 
Hypnosis is a condition of mental happenings in 
which the personally directed will appears to be
-P-A-G-E-244
PERSONALITY 225 
set aside, the individual becoming possessed by 
tendencies that are not normally controlled. The 
resemblance of hypnosis to dream-states is evident. 
But in hypnosis the control is more apparent than 
in the average dream. The attention is highly 
concentrated, and a single purposive aim is mani- 
fest. We surrender our normal critical attitude 
to an uncritical but highly tenacious aim, lead- 
ing us in a narrow but consistent set of activi- 
ties which seem to be prompted from outside us. 
This is the ‘artificially narrowed consciousness’ 
of the hypnotized subject. There are, however, 
certain types of dream not readily, perhaps not at 
all, distinguishable from the hypnotic state. These 
are the ‘somnambulisms’, in which the dreamer is 
aroused to activities such as sleepwalking and the 
like. These motor forms of dream-state are very 
like the analogous hypnotic states, and it has been 
asserted that one can sometimes insinuate oneself 
into another’s somnambulism and thus assume 
direction over the sleepwalker’s activities, just as 
the hypnotist directs the behavior of his subject. 
The difference between dream-states and hypnotic 
states is chiefly in the absence of ‘rapport’ in 
dreams. By ‘rapport’ is meant the intimate bond 
connecting subject and hypnotist. The ideas of 
dream-states do not possess the power of sugges- 
tion and control manifest in hypnosis. 
Individuals show marked differences in sugges- 
tibility. Some are ever ready to throw off per- 
sonal responsibility for their acts, and follow more
-P-A-G-E-245
226 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
or less uncritically the leads which perception and 
association afford. Others are very slightly sub- 
ject to the domination of ideas and percepts 
that are not first weighed in the balance of per- 
sonal aim and desire. 
It has often been said that all hypnosis is at root 
auto-hypnosis. This does not mean that the indi- 
vidual actively hypnotizes himself. He can, how- 
ever, by a conscious effort avoid the many-sided 
control of his personal directive tendencies, in order 
to follow uncritically the lines of thought and activ- 
ity suggested by a certain situation. What it does 
mean is that a hypnotist is not indispensable in 
arousing a condition of hypnosis. The doctrine 
that magnetic emanations of some sort pass from 
the hypnotist to his subject, to inform his subse- 
quent activities, has long since been discarded as 
untrue. But there remains the fact of hypnosis 
as a state in which personal direction is surrendered 
in large measure. The hypnotic state is not one 
in which directive tendencies are minimized, but 
one in which certain directions, — namely, those 
arising from the situation rather than from per- 
sonal aims,— are greatly magnified in importance. 
An interesting feature of hypnotism is the so- 
called post-hypnotic suggestion. It is possible to 
impress the mind of a hypnotized subject with a 
suggested act to be carried out in the future when 
a certain situation arises. The associations formed 
in hypnosis possess unusual strength. Accordingly, 
the occurrence of the situation, place and time, will
-P-A-G-E-246
PERSONALITY 227 
often suffice to throw the individual to whom the 
suggestion has been given into a temporary hyp- 
notic state. He will then proceed to perform 
a previously suggested act, often a very absurd 
one. 
Hypnotism may, therefore, be regarded as an 
aberration of personality. The failure of egocen- 
tric control and the dominance of extraneous 
suggestion bring about a peculiar type of half-con- 
sciousness. Instead of a complete synthesis such 
as is effected in the normal waking state by the 
hierarchy of directive tendencies, with their asso- 
ciative expressions, we have a condition in which 
association is much more prominent, and in which 
strictly personal tendencies are subordinated. The 
stress thus laid upon sensory and imaginal con- 
tents may be said to account for the often manifest 
hypersensitivity that is a common occurrence in 
hypnosis. 
76. Multiple Personality 
The consideration of hypnosis brings us to an 
aberration of personality, representing a peculiar 
modification of hypnotic and pathological condi- 
tions. This is the fact of multiple personality. 
We have found hypnosis to be an exaggerated form 
of suggestion. Multiple personalities develop in 
a similar manner from disaggregations among the 
ruling tendencies of our lives, and the crystalliza- 
tion of certain specific tendencies and experiences 
into more or less autonomous groups.
-P-A-G-E-247
228 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
James has pointed out the fact that each of us 
is a bundle of more or less distinct personalities. 
Our general attitudes and directive tendencies 
vary in accordance with the situation confronting 
us. Our Sunday habits may contrast strikingly 
with our week-day behavior. We have one man- 
ner when we address our friends, and another 
toward strangers. We have special attitudes for 
those of our own sex, differing from our ways 
with those of the opposite sex; and we have still 
other adjustments toward children and servants. 
It is only necessary to conceive such a special at- 
titude, bearing either upon percepts or upon ideas, 
as developing and crystallizing to a point where it 
represents a fairly complete type of behavior, and 
then becoming dissociated from some other type 
or types of behavior, and the multiple personality 
is established. The real problems underlying 
these manifestations are, the causes of dissociation, 
and the part played by the ego in each separate 
existence. 
The cases that have been examined present 
rather a bewildering complexity. Personality No. 1 
may have a knowledge of the acts of personality 
No. 2, while personality No. 2 is oblivious of the 
existence of personality No.1, It may also happen 
that when the patient is restored to a normal con- 
dition, personality No. 2, which appeared to have 
the narrower range of view, represents, neverthe- 
less, the true character of the individual. Such 
cases have led certain workers to infer the possi-
-P-A-G-E-248
PERSONALITY 229 
‘bility of more than one real ego in a single individ- 
ual. However this may be, the facts of multiple 
personality seem to show that disaggregations of 
personality are not mere hypnotic states, in which 
extraneous suggestions are the sole cause. But 
whether the two or more egos thus in evidence 
have a common origin, or are original and inde- 
pendent entities, or are the fortuitous results of 
disaggregate attitudes, —- these are questions which 
we are not yet able to answer. A ‘cure’ ap- 
pears to be effected whenever one personality can 
be made to dominate over the other, either by pro- 
viding the individual with a common knowledge 
of his different types of attitude and behavior, or 
by effectively shutting out and preventing the re- 
appearance of the abnormal manifestations. The 
provocation of a state of semi-hypnosis often per- 
mits the physician to bring these disaggregate mani- 
festations together into one unified state, and thus 
gradually to educate the individual to a knowledge 
of his aberrations, or by a powerful negative sugges- 
tion to suppress the supernumerary personalities. 
77. Telepathy and Spiritism 
A set of alleged facts bearing upon personality 
is revealed in the study of telepathy and spiritism. 
By telepathy is meant the communication of mind 
and mind, without recourse to the normal channels 
of sense. Spiritism involves telepathic communica- 
tion, with the further assumption that it may obtain 
between embodied and disembodied spirits. We
-P-A-G-E-249
230 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
here meet with the possibility of personality tran- 
scending bodily modes of expression. The hypothe- 
sis which maintains that mind can express itself 
only in and through physiological processes is disin- 
clined to accept any of the evidence brought for- 
ward in support of these facts. It should be noted, 
however, that the acceptance of such facts, while 
it would modify our conceptions of mental hap- 
penings, would not necessarily be inconsistent with 
our general physical conceptions. Even a ‘dis- 
embodied’ intelligence might conceivably be so 
correlated with physical phenomena of the ether 
as to duplicate the essential patterns of the brain- 
processes when these have been reduced to their 
lowest terms of corpuscular motion. Accordingly, 
a satisfactory demonstration of the existence of 
telepathy and spiritism cannot be regarded as a 
crucial test for the existence of personality inde- 
pendent of any physical counterpart. Yet it 
must be confessed that the demonstrations, de- 
spite the numerous investigations carried on with 
such zeal during the past two decades by the 
various societies for, psychical research all over the 
’ world, have thus far failed to convince scientists 
of the conclusiveness of their findings. 
The question is still open, but it is worthy of 
fair consideration, and no one is justified in dog- 
matically refusing to consider either telepathy or 
spiritism as theories which the future may stamp 
as demonstrable truths. We must, at least, recog- 
nize the possible importance of such demonstra-
-P-A-G-E-250
PERSONALITY 231 
tions as furnishing us with valid data for the 
assumption of personal survival after bodily 
death. 
Some investigators are convinced that telepathy 
has been demonstrated, but are disinclined to a 
belief in spiritism. Telepathy of itself, is, of course, 
no guarantee of survival, since it posits merely the 
possibility of a direct communication between 
mind and mind, each in its living body. The 
transference of thought, thus assumed, may be at- 
tended by physical phenomena, as already noted, 
or it may be largely a spiritual affair differing in 
nature from any known physical effects. But in 
neither case would the survival of intelligence 
after bodily dissolution be proven, because it 
might still be argued that the generation of a 
thought in the one mind and its reception in 
another without recourse to the ordinary channels 
of communication depends upon physiological con- 
ditions. Only after it has been shown beyond 
a reasonable doubt that the message received was 
originated in a mind no longer inhabiting a bodily 
frame, shall we have evidence that personality 
can survive the existence in which we now know 
it, and can pass on, with or without a physical 
counterpart, to some realm beyond our ken. 
So far as the conditions are concerned which usu- 
ally attend these telepathic and spiritistic manifes- 
tations, we need only remark that they are closely 
akin to the hypnotic states already mentioned. 
The ‘medium’ through whom messages are re-
-P-A-G-E-251
232 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
ceived is usually in a trance-state, and thus pos- 
sesses the hypersensitivity and vivid imagery 
characteristic of the hypnotized individual. Mul- 
tiple personalities also play their part in the 
‘possession’ of the medium by a spirit ‘guide’ or 
‘control’, who is supposed to act as intermediary 
between this realm and the other. 
Many interesting problems arise in connection 
with these manifestations. ‘Automatic’ writing 
and speech form a remarkable chapter of psy- 
chology. But in themselves they are not at all 
mysterious, and require no supernatural assump- 
tions for their explanation. These automatisms 
are distinguished from ordinary vocational acts 
chiefly by the fact that they are not consciously 
willed, but arise from extraneous suggestion. Thus 
the individual who performs them is the one most 
mystified, since he finds himself doing invol- 
untarily the things that ordinarily require voli- 
tional effort and direction. But as types of 
_ behavior, this simply means that they are now on 
the level of a direct perceptual response, as when, 
in walking, we avoid a stone in the road without 
being conscious of the act.

CHAPTER XVIII 
PERSONALITY: INSANITY 
78. Definition of Insanity 
ISTURBANCES of personality which go 
beyond the normal interruptions of sleep, 
and the semi-abnormal phenomena of hypnosis, 
are classified under the head of insanity. It is 
no more possible to draw a clear-cut line of demar- 
cation between sanity and insanity than it is be- 
tween sleep and waking, hypnosis and suggestion, 
or multiple personality and normal prejudice. It 
is often said that everyone is a little insane, but it 
is more accurate to say that the insane have many 
normal characteristics. The matter is sometimes 
settled, for legal purposes, on the issue of personal 
responsibility. When the question is largely a 
practical one, the individual is judged in accordance 
with his ability to meet adequately the most urgent 
needs of everyday life. It follows that many cases 
in which the general character of mental happen- 
ings is distinctly abnormal, fail to be classed as in- 
sane, since they are judged to be ‘harmless’, On 
the other hand, individuals who are in many re- 
spects highly intelligent are subjected to a strict 
surveillance because of certain aberrations which 
make them a menace to society. Insanity is, 
therefore, better described as a change in an individ- 
ual which renders him incapable of normal adjust-
-P-A-G-E-253
234 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
ment to his environment, the change being mental, 
and usually due to disease of the brain. 
In all the modifications of personality with which 
we have hitherto been dealing, the disturbances 
were not necessarily, nor typically, of a pathologi- 
cal order. That is to say, they were not mainly 
attributable to physiological defects, nor to structu- 
tal lesions of the nervous system. But even in the 
case of insanity it cannot be said with assurance 
that all mental disease is founded on bodily disease. 
Here again arises the question as to the independ- 
ence of personality with reference to the bodily 
mechanism. And if this question be answered 
affirmatively, we have still the problem of deter- 
mining whether the purely psychical essence which 
constitutes the ego is subject to disorders within 
itself, or whether a deranged mind is occasioned 
entirely by defects of the body through which it 
is manifested. 
79. Symptoms of Insanity 
Symptoms of insanity may be detected in con- 
nection with all the facts, both analytic and syn- 
thetic, with which we have been dealing. In the 
field of sensation we find disturbances which are 
designated under the three heads of hyperas- 
thesia, hypesthesia, and paresthesia, These de- 
note, respectively, a lowering of the threshold of 
sensitivity, a raising of the threshold, and a falsi- 
fication of the sensory content. A common illus- 
tration of the last-named is the morbid sensation
-P-A-G-E-254
PERSONALITY: INSANITY 235 
of insects crawling upon the body. In connection 
with imagery, we have conspicuously the halluci- 
nations arising from a peculiar intensity of the 
images, and the consequent failure to detect them 
as being of central origin. The affections show 
marked derangement in their frequent and pro- 
longed appearance, their exceptional intensity, 
and also in their total disappearance. The notions 
and relations of thought may show all manner 
of abnormality as to adequacy and completeness, 
presence and absence. It should be noted, how- 
ever, that none of these disturbances is truly 
symptomatic of insanity, since all of them occur 
frequently as normal variations. 
It is, of course, among the synthetic facts that 
insanity makes itself most clearly evident. De- 
rangements in attention, memory and association, 
perception, ideation, reaction, and emotion, fur- 
nish us with the clinical pictures which reveal the 
most striking characteristics of the insane mind. 
It would carry us too far afield to enter into a de- 
tailed discussion of these manifold symptoms, but 
we may mention briefly some of the chief types of 
mental disease which the psychiatrist is able to 
distinguish by reference to these symptoms and 
their underlying causes. 
80. Classification of Types 
It is convenient to classify these types under 
two main heads: — (1) Functional Psychoses, and 
(2) Structural Psychoses. This division bears wit-
-P-A-G-E-255
236 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
ness to the possibility that certain insanities are 
purely psychical, while others are of physical ori- 
gin. But all that we can be assured of at present 
is the fact that the ‘structural’ psychoses are cor- 
related with disease of the brain, whereas for the 
‘functional’ psychoses a physical basis has not yet 
been discovered. 
1. The Functional Psychoses 
We may distinguish seven rather distinct forms 
of this type. With the exception of paranoia and 
dementia precox, which are progressive, these 
are distinctly recoverable kinds of insanity; the 
patients return to their normal mental condition 
after the disease has run its course. 
(a) The hallucinatory deliria are characterized 
by hallucinations and lack of self-consciousness 
and self-restraint. They appear to be founded 
in a peculiar suggestibility, which permits the 
acceptance of ideas as objective facts. Delu- 
sions or misinterpretations of facts are also con- 
spicuous. 
(b) Mania is characterized by an abnormal ex- 
citability manifest in a rapid ‘flight of ideas’ such 
as we have already described in our study of idea- 
tion, and also in a marked tendency to violent 
motor activity, which is termed hyperkinesis. The 
maniac is usually in a state of great emotional 
excitement. This is typically pleasurable, although 
an unpleasant state of irritability is also frequently 
evident.
-P-A-G-E-256
we 
Ee PERSONALITY: INSANITY ~ 237 
(c) Melancholia presents the opposite picture 
of emotional depression or anxiety, in which both 
bodily and intellectual feelings may be involved. 
There is frequently a slowing of thought and 
movement, while aboulia, or loss of will-power, is 
also often to be noted. 
(d) Circular psychoses are evident when manic 
and depressive states succeed each other, either 
regularly or irregularly. Intervals of sanity may 
occur between the insane periods. 
(e) Paranoia is primarily a disease of the syn- 
thetic organization of mental happenings. We 
have described its main symptom in our study of 
ideation by reference to the ‘fixed idea’. Lack of 
proper control over the directive tendencies makes 
abnormal associations possible. In consequence, 
the individual usually suffers from delusions of one 
sort or another, which are subject to change, and 
may be complicated by the appearance of hallu- 
cinations. This type of insanity is one of the most 
difficult to deal with forensically, since the patient 
may possess a marked degree of intelligence, and 
hence the ability to make highly cogent the fancied 
wrongs which he suffers at the hands of others. 
(f) Dementia precox involves an affection, 
more or less. complete, of the mental capacities -of 
the individual. Although patients with this dis- 
ease are well orientated, and show no ‘clouding’ 
of consciousness, all exhibit a failure to attend to 
most of the daily occurrences. At the same time 
there is a lack of interest and a ‘don’t care’ attitude.
-P-A-G-E-257
238 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
For these reasons, there appear defects of memory, 
although in memory tests in which the attention is 
directed to the stimuli it may not be possible to 
determine this. There is also an emotional dete- 
rioration, or dilapidation, and the stream of thought 
is irregular, so that at times incoherent conversa- 
tion, best described as ‘word-salad’, is found. 
The disease appears without definite cause, usually 
at the age of puberty. Whether or not it is a true 
functional psychosis, is a matter of dispute. 
(g) Hysteria is one of the most interesting forms 
of aberration, from the psychologist’s point of view, 
since its symptoms are widespread throughout 
humanity and offer all degrees of intermediate 
stages from normal to abnormal manifestations. 
The two most marked symptoms of hysteria are 
the heightened degrees of emotivity and suggesti- 
bility. Disturbances of sensation, and among the 
motor and glandular reactions, are also frequent. 
The disease shows many resemblances to hypnoidal 
conditions which have become chronic. That 
this resemblance is in a large measure real is indi- 
cated by the fact that patients are often cured by 
suggestive treatment. The psychoanalytic methods 
which make use of a patient’s dreams and 
‘free’ or unrestrained associations, to investigate 
the obsessive complexes occurring in such cases, 
have been very successful in reviving the original 
experiences of emotional shock that underly these 
psychoses. When this can be done, the patient is 
often relieved of his fancied affections and inca-
-P-A-G-E-258
PERSONALITY: INSANITY 239 
pacities, and restored to a rational control over 
his mental and bodily processes. 
Since an emotional shock is regarded as the most 
common cause for such disturbances, it is often 
possible to effect a cure by reviving the original 
experience and subjecting it to a detailed rational 
consideration. The value of such a revival and 
rational consideration is quite evident in practice. 
The beneficial effects of the confessional, which 
involves a similar procedure, have long been under- 
stood and practised in the Catholic church. The 
difficulty in the case of hysterical subjects lies in 
the fact that without aid they are unable to revive 
the original cause of their trouble. The ‘com- 
plexes’ are often of a sexual nature, dependent 
upon experiences which the patient has tried to for- 
get. Asaresult, the details of the original situa- 
tion have become dissociated, so that they can no 
longer be recalled, but directive tendencies issuing 
from this source are still powerful. These are made 
manifest in various fantastic forms whenever the 
individual lapses from a rigidly rational state of 
mind. Thus, in dreams these ‘complexes’ deter- 
mine the course of fantasy. In waking life imme- 
diate and uncritical associative responses are often 
indicative of the complex. We have already made 
mention of these facts in discussing association and 
dream-states. 
By analyzing the patient’s dreams, and the 
character of his ‘free’ associations, it is often pos- 
sible to reconstruct the original experience. When
-P-A-G-E-259
240 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
this can be done and the patient is confronted with 
it in all its bearings, he learns to realize its mean- 
ing and it then ceases to obsess him. 
This theory, which is associated principally with 
the writings and practice of Freud and his school, 
has attained great prominence in recent years. 
The cures effected by these psychoanalytic methods 
are too striking to be overlooked. Yet there is no 
unaminity of opinion regarding the theoretical de- 
tails of the mechanism upon which the Freudian 
theory depends. It is doubtful whether all hyste- 
ria is attributable to sexual experience, especially 
experience of childhood, as Freud maintains. But 
it is generally agreed that an emotional shock of 
some sort is the most frequent cause of this type 
of disease, and that perseverative tendencies of 
unusual strength occasion many of the disturbing 
effects which characterize the hysterical mind. 
Whether hysteria is a true functional psychosis 
or not is open to debate. Even though its cause be 
an emotional shock, it is still possible that more or 
less fundamental organic defects accompany and 
condition the psychoses. The most common form 
of mental alienation is of this type, and is designated 
as psychesthenia. It includes the ‘fears’, ‘doubts’, 
.and other frequent aberrations which mark 
the borderland region between sane and insane 
minds. 
It will be noted that all these functional psy- 
choses are attributable to a disorganization of 
mental happenings occasioned by abnormal or inef-
-P-A-G-E-260
PERSONALITY: INSANITY 241 
fective direction. They may, therefore, be referred 
to as diseases of the directive tendencies. It is 
this fact that constitutes them as ‘functional’ dis- 
turbances. Whether or not they have an organic 
basis is a question which can be answered only 
after we have further information at our command. 
2. The Structural Psychoses 
In distinguishing the types of insanity belong- 
ing to this class, we are guided by the nature of 
the structural defect, as well as by the psychologi- 
cal symptoms. Many of the mental conditions 
already described reappear in these structural 
psychoses. 
(a) The epileptic psychoses attach to a rather 
large precentage of individuals who suffer from 
epilepsy. Dazed conditions and stupor, irritability 
and unconscious violence, are the most character- 
istic symptoms of this form of insanity. The 
epileptic fit is occasionally attended by a severe 
retrograde amnesia. After recovery the individual 
is more or less completely disorientated, and is 
unable to recognize his surroundings or to recall 
his past experiences. This may be regarded as 
a peculiarly aggravated resultant of the normal 
retroactive amnesia accompanying sudden shocks 
of all kinds, already discussed in our study of 
memory. 
(b) The choreic psychoses are denoted by the 
hyper-excitability, loss of memory, and other ab- 
normal tendencies arising in connection with the
-P-A-G-E-261
242 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
muscular twitchings that characterize chorea. 
It will be noted that both this and the epileptic 
form of insanity are directly attributable to physi- 
cal defects. They may therefore be regarded as 
derived from the irritations which the disease oc- 
casions. The psychoses are not, in either case, 
necessary consequences of the disease. 
(c) The toxic psychoses are all founded upon the 
effects of poisons in the nervous system. The 
poisons may be endogenous, i.e., prepared within 
the body itself, or exogenous, #.e., introduced from 
without. The resulting aberrations are of various 
sorts. The endogenous forms include many 
cases of weak-mindedness and cretinism, based 
upon imperfect development of the nervous 
system, and also the confusion and delirium super- 
induced by infections and exhaustion. The exog- 
enous forms are characterized by the various 
deliria and hallucinations attending indulgence 
in alcohol, morphine, cocaine and other drugs. 
Among diseases of the brain we find the most 
serious and incurable defects of mental life. 
(d) General paresis, or ‘softening of the brain’, 
is the most outstanding form of insanity directly 
traceable to disease of the cortex. Its symptoms 
in the earlier stages of the disease are nervous and 
mental weakness, or instability. Disturbances 
among the reflexes, such as the knee-jerk and the 
pupillar reflex, are often found. Megalomania, 7.e., 
ideas of personal exaltation and expansiveness, 
though formerly regarded as a typical symptom,
-P-A-G-E-262
PERSONALITY: INSANITY 243 
is now found to be less universal. These symptoms 
are followed by a progressive dementia and bodily 
paralysis as the disease develops. The origin of 
this malady is now generally attributed to syphilitic 
infection. 
(e) Senile dementia results from atrophy of the 
brain consequent upon old age. It is character- 
ized by various disturbances of the memory and 
other mental and physical capacities and abilities. 
(f) Arterio-sclerosis, apoplexy and brain-tumors 
may also be mentioned as organic causes of mental 
derangement. 
3. Imbecility 
The various forms of imbecility are now usually 
excluded from the treatment of insanity, inas- 
much as they are almost invariably. congenital 
defects, and are continuous in nature. They can- 
not, therefore, be described as “‘a change in an 
individual which renders him incapable of normal 
adjustment to his environment”. Their impor- 
tance for psychology, however, demands that we 
should make mention of them in order to indicate 
their most outstanding characteristics. 
The disease is attributed to imperfect or arrested 
development of the brain. It appears in various 
stages, from simple retardation, through weak- 
mindedness and imbecility, to complete idiocy. 
It may be either congenital or acquired, although 
an hereditary taint appears to be the chief cause. 
Tt is a well-known fact that the mating of weak-
-P-A-G-E-263
244 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
minded individuals results in the production of 
weak-minded offspring. The acquired diseases 
of this type are characterized with certainty only 
by the fact that they do not appear at once in the 
development of the infant. Some occur as a result 
of organic disease, such as meningitis and scarlet 
fever. 
4. Conclusion 
This brief summary will serve to reveal the 
general nature of insanity and its twofold depend- 
ence, upon bodily defects, which are clearly recog- 
nizable, and upon mental shocks, which may or 
may not have a physical counterpart. The per- 
sonality suffers more or less according to the nature 
of the disease. The empirical ego may suffer 
alteration through derangements in general bodily 
sensitivity and affection. The egocentric direc- 
tions are weakened whenever a high degree of 
suggestibility usurps the primary control over men- 
tal happenings. Thus we see again how the me- 
chanical and impersonal processes of association 
contrast with the purposive and personal directions 
which organization among the mental activities 
affords.

81. General Summary on Personality 
We are forced to confess that the problem of 
personality is unsolved. We have, however, sub- 
stantial grounds for attributing to personality a 
relative independence of the mechanical processes 
of matter. It is not at all inconceivable, indeed, 
that personality may be absolutely independent 
of the gross forms of physiological activity with 
which it is so intimately connected in the living 
organism. It is evident that personality is an 
integrative resultant based upon the adaptive 
processes of living matter. Its origin may be 
conceived in alternative ways. 
1. The Mechanistic Theory of Personality 
Personality has a purely mechanical origin. This 
is a view which we have already proposed to dis- 
card, since it appears inadequate to explain or 
justify the essential performances of life. ‘It is, 
however, a view which commands so much respect 
in many quarters that we cannot afford to overlook 
it. In accordance with such a theory all the direct- 
ive tendencies, including those which we have 
described as egocentric, are really but the expres- 
sion of causal sequences in material forces. The 
ego is a fiction, and consciousness is but an impotent 
reflection of material processes.
-P-A-G-E-265
246 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
2. The Spiritualistic Theory of Personality — 
(a) Individual: — Personality is an independent 
Spiritual occurrence of an individual sort. It occurs 
in connection with certain bodily processes, and 
directs their activities, although neither adding to 
nor subtracting from the energy which such bodily 
processes involve. It creates syntheses among the 
mental elements at its disposal. These interact 
with the physical processes of the body, thus 
establishing a reciprocal relationship between the 
physical and the mental realms. The mental 
elements and their syntheses, although of a totally 
different order from the physical elements, are 
nevertheless dependent upon this interaction for 
their origin and development. It is an open ques- 
tion whether or not an individual personality, 
which develops in this way and is so largely 
dependent upon reciprocal interaction with phys- 
' siological processes, may attain to a degree of in- 
dependence capable of transcending bodily death 
and carrying on its existence with or without a 
material counterpart of a subtler order. 
(b) Cosmic: — Personality is a spiritual occurrence 
distinct from bodily processes, yet a dependent mani- 
festation of the world-soul. The individuality is, on 
this theory, only partial. The adaptive processes 
of living matter are but an expression of spiritual 
life as a whole which informs with more or 
less completeness all organic beings. Personality 
evolves in this bodily setting to only a relative
-P-A-G-E-266
PERSONALITY: INSANITY 247 
independence. A clear distinction between this 
view and the preceding one cannot be drawn. It 
will be noted that this theory is consistent with 
the philosophical conception of Nirvana, or the 
final and complete reabsorption of the personality 
into the world-soul whence it originated. 
These alternative views are only suggestive in 
their value, and many modifications of the respec- 
tive theories are possible. They may serve, 
however, to denote some of the chief issues which 
the problem of personality presents for considera- 
tion, and thus to round out in a measure our dis- 
cussion of this important but obscure problem.
-P-A-G-E-267
CHAPTER XIX 
CHARACTER 
82. Introduction 
UR consideration is finally directed to the gen- 
eral problem of character. In the preceding 
sections we have endeavored to trace the main facts 
involved in the origin of the active tendencies which 
make for individuality in mental life. The term 
‘character’, which we have chosen to designate this 
concluding chapter on the issues of psychology, is 
intended to denote the outcome of mental proc- 
esses in the concrete acts of reason, appreciation, 
conduct and reverence that enable us to judge 
individuality. It will be noted at once that these 
evidences of character are subsumed under the 
four general heads of Logic, Asthetics, Ethics and 
Religion, the peculiar sentiments of which we have 
already discussed in our chapter on the emotions. 
That this classification of character is fairly ade- 
quate so far as it goes, is apparent from the fact 
that each class denotes a distinct philosophic dis- 
cipline, with its special problems and literature. 
The adoption of this classification here is appro- 
priate, further, since in discussing the psycholog- 
ical bases of character from these points of view, 
we are also laying the foundations for the more de- 
tailed philosophical considerations that form the 
next step in the study of mental science. 
But character is not completely described in
-P-A-G-E-268
CHARACTER 249 
the terms of these four disciplines. There are at 
least three other important aspects to be taken 
into account, each of which culminates in a spe- 
cial discipline. These three additional points of 
view are furnished in the sciences of Education, 
Sociology and Organic Behavior, or ‘Comparative 
Psychology’, as it is often termed. They are not 
disciplines on the same level with the four first men- 
tioned, as will be readily seen. There are no special 
sentiments or other mental syntheses character- 
izing their psychological foundations. On the 
contrary, they overlap with these disciplines and 
with one another, since their problems are gen- 
eral rather than specific. Thus, the problem of 
education is founded in the learning-process, but 
this process is also prominent in the study of 
comparative psychology, which deals with organic 
behavior in all its phases. Sociology, being con- 
cerned with the interactions of individuals, both 
human and animal, in the social group, is also in- 
terested in the learning-process and in the objective 
types of behavior. 
Behavior is perhaps the most general term capa- 
ble of expressing the common interests of these 
three disciplines, and it is evident from all that 
has gone before that behavior is rooted variously 
in the logical, esthetic, moral and religious atti- 
tudes. But it also goes beyond all these and 
finds its ultimate roots in the processes, physio- 
logical and mental, preceding these higher de- 
velopments of the intellect.
-P-A-G-E-269
250 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
In a general way, therefore, it is possible to say 
that character is the expression of individuality, 
which in turn is founded in the ultimate determina- 
tions of organic life as modified by the intellectual 
developments of reason, appreciation, morality and 
religion. 
It will, perhaps, best serve our purpose to discuss 
first the general aspects of character, thence pro- 
ceeding to the intellectual modifications above 
indicated. 
83. Conscious Behavior 
The behavior of an individual is a combined re- 
sultant of his organic capacities, his reason and his 
environment. We have already traced the inter- 
relationships of these three factors at sufficient 
length to understand their bearings one upon 
another. - 
What we have not yet considered is the essential 
motive, which raises intelligent so immeasurably 
above unintelligent forms of behavior. In tracing 
the course of experience we have been able to dis- 
tinguish mechanical and purposive activities. Me- 
chanical activities afford direct reactions of the 
reflex type. They may also provide for the asso- 
ciative connection of contiguous experiences. The 
purposive activities, on the other hand, indicate 
an aim which leads beyond the immediate reac- 
tion and content of consciousness. This aim at the 
fulfilment of conditions, all of which are not imme- 
diately present in the psychophysical complex of
-P-A-G-E-270
CHARACTER 251 
the moment, constitutes the organism as a free 
agent. Adjustment to environment is not merely 
the result of a complex reaction, but is also a thing 
which the organism seeks to attain. Experience 
is thus shot through with active tendencies, some 
conscious, and others unconscious, but all revealing 
themselves in the direction they give to the course 
of mental happenings. 
We have seen that the most fundamental type of 
direction is that of organic adaptation, as revealed 
in instinctive behavior. But the instincts are not 
merely individual, — they are also in some measure 
codperative. Thus, a foundation is laid for both 
individual and social character in the more or less 
unconscious strivings resident in all organic life. 
The elements of the learning-process, which is 
basic for education, are also found to be a natural 
resultant of this general directive tendency as it 
operates upon inherent capacities and the data of 
experience. , 
But character is something more than the result- 
ant of instinctive and habitual behavior. There is 
also an intellectual contribution involved, such as 
is not readily discernible in the behavior of animals. 
This contribution we term the consciousness of 
value. Values are both objective and subjective. 
The efficiency of the instinctive behavior of an ant 
may be said to constitute an objective value, but 
we have no reason to regard this as subjectively 
apprehended by the ant. In speaking of character, 
however, a subjective apprehension is implicitly
-P-A-G-E-271
252 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
involved. The soldier on the field of battle, who 
obeys the commands of his officer without regard to 
personal welfare, is brave only in so far as he is 
conscious of the sacrifice he is making for his coun- 
try’s cause. The objective value of his perform- 
ance may be great, while subjectively he is quite 
oblivious to the nature of his act. The brave 
man, in the true sense, is one who knows that 
he is overcoming serious obstacles in the per- 
formance of a duty. 
Values of a subjective order are of four kinds: 
logical, esthetic, ethical and religious. To acquire 
character, an individual must be able to discern 
these. Value attaches to an ideal, something of 
worth for which one ought to strive. Consequently, 
the aims of logic, esthetics, ethics and religion are 
to establish norms of value in their several fields. 
It is evident that psychology has a different aim. 
It is concerned with mental processes as they 
exist in all possible diversity, but not in their values. 
The psychology of character must endeavor to 
show the basis upon which a subjective conscious- 
ness of value is formed, but it is indifferent to the 
ideals which humanity holds before it. A study 
of these ideals, however, cannot be satisfactorily 
undertaken without an understanding of the proc- 
esses by which they become manifest in the human 
mind. Psychology, therefore, is fundamental to 
the normative disciplines, and we are justified in 
indicating here the nature of these psychological 
foundations.
-P-A-G-E-272
CHARACTER 253 
84. Logical Character 
Let us first consider the logical or rational values. 
One reasons for the sake of knowing the truth. 
The most immediate promptings for rational think- 
ing are doubtless practical in nature. Knowledge 
of the truth furthers adaptation and adjust- 
ment. Invalid reasoning leads to imperfect ad- 
justment. The apprehension of truth is, therefore, 
requisite to a normal progress in human affairs. 
But this fact conditions only the main trend of 
behavior. It does not condition the establishment 
of an ideal, or the consciousness of logical values. 
The ideal transcends the practical. It is not a 
goal which can be attained at any time, but one 
which is rarely if ever realizable. It is not so much 
an immediately desired consummation, as a remote 
and ultimate fulfilment. “A man’s reach should 
exceed his grasp.” ‘The essence of us is forward- 
striving toward a flying goal.” Problems are con- 
stantly before us, directing our thought toward 
their solution. 
From our study of ideation we have found that the 
nature of this process of solution is one of judgment 
and inference. We have seen that a careful bal- 
ance must be maintained between the automatic 
activities of association, on the one hand, and the 
excessive restraint of fixed and inflexible directive 
tendencies, on the other hand. In discussing emo- 
tion we have detected a means of evaluating the 
rational processes through our sense of conformity
-P-A-G-E-273
254 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
and nonconformity. This, accordingly, may pro- 
voke sentiments conducive to the furtherance 
or hindrance of any particular train of thought. 
It is because all thinking issues in an ideal or- 
ganization of all the data of experience that, when- 
ever we think, a norm is constantly in process of 
formulation. This norm we call truth. Thus, a 
rational character is evolved in the measure that 
the thinker is conscious of this norm and conducts 
his thought in channels leading to its further elabo- 
ration and fulfilment. 
Rational values are not merely felt values, they 
are also known values. That is, they constitute 
a species of mental reaction which is essentially 
notional. The affective features provide a certain 
relish to reasoning, which is conducive to increased 
energy and keener apprehension. The reasoning 
of genius is largely of this type. The direct appre- 
hension of affective distinctions of conformity and 
nonconformity enables the genius to proceed 
intuitively, without the careful testing of each 
process. Ina more plodding type of mind, affective 
nuances may count for little, since the thinker 
must satisfy the demands for proof as each judgment 
is established. : 
But in either case the logical procedure is based 
upon an attitude of mind involving a dominant 
problem or purpose, together with numerous sub- 
ordinate directions, all of which issue in the solu- 
tion demanded.
-P-A-G-E-274
CHARACTER 255 
85. Aisthetic Character 
In the case of esthetics the norm which guides 
mental operations is that of beawly. The attitude 
assumed is the one described as appreciation. To 
appreciate aesthetically is to apprehend the formal 
fitness or conformity of a situation. This we call 
contemplation. The value of beauty does not con- 
sist in objective worth, but in a subjective state of 
contemplation. 
Contemplation involves affective factors in a 
greater degree than does reasoning, since, as we have 
seen, an esthetic state is always a state of pleasure. 
But it is something more than the mere feeling 
of a distinctive mode of pleasure. An ideal is evi- 
dent in the esthetic attitude, just as it is in the 
rational attitude. This ideal is, again, a conception 
involving notions and mental activities. Trains 
of thought and behavior are provoked which aim 
at the realization of a contemplative state of mind. 
Whereas the ideal of truth is that of systematized 
knowledge, the ideal of beauty is that of conformity 
in experience. It is when the objects of experience 
present an aspect of fitness and cohesiveness with- 
out an ulterior purpose or reference, that we detect 
in them a contemplative value, and describe them as 
beautiful. When the esthetic attitude is strong 
enough, we are able to contemplate and fuse 
into a unitary whole the most diverse and con- 
flicting elements. Such moments are, however, 
rare, except when the objective forms are of a
-P-A-G-E-275
256 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
nature to justify a conformable pattern of the 
whole. 
It is for this reason that the work of art is of 
paramount importance in the arousal of the esthetic 
attitude. Not that it is impossible to think and 
imagine esthetically, but rather that without ob- 
jective reference it is difficult to establish these 
units of conformity. The work of art aims to 
supply us with an object in the contemplation of 
which we may sink ourselves, and find 4 complete 
expression for our esthetic demands. It is calcu- 
lated to seize upon us and hold us in rapt con- 
templation by the relative perfection it offers. 
Esthetic ideas provoke an expressive tendency, 
which we term the artistic impulse. It is this 
impulse to render into permanent form what 
would otherwise be but a fugitive thought, that 
leads to the artistic expressions of literature, the 
pictorial arts and music. By reason of their 
permanent possibilities for arousing an esthetic 
attitude, these are among the most priceless 
possessions of the human race. 
The esthetic attitude is differentiated from other 
attitudes of mind chiefly by the non-voluntary 
character of its processes. In a general way we 
may say that any experience synthesized by a 
degree of conformity among its parts to such an 
extent that it makes no demands on voluntary 
activity, either ideational or perceptual, provides 
a basis for esthetic contemplation. This lack of 
voluntary activity is sometimes expressed by the
-P-A-G-E-276
CHARACTER 257 
terms disinterested, detached, and the like. These 
terms, however, are not entirely adequate, because, 
in the first place, the esthetic state is not one in 
which interest is lacking. On the contrary, it 
is one in which interest is very prominent. To 
describe this state as disinterested can only mean 
that we are not at the time actively engaged in 
operations of adjustment, either physical or mental. 
The situation must be presented with a degree of 
completeness that fills us with a sentiment of co- 
hesiveness and fitness. As for detachment, that can 
only mean the suspension, in a state of vivid atten- 
tion, of those self-imposed fiats of the will which 
are characteristic of volitional experience. Thus 
Oscar Wilde in his brilliant essay, The Decay of Ly- 
ing, writes: ‘‘The only beautiful things... are 
the things that do not concern us.” 
We must, however, differentiate the esthetic 
state more closely from other non-voluntary ex- 
periences. Those, for instance, which we encounter 
in ‘day-dreaming’ and ‘wool-gathering’ evidently 
lack a uniformity and cohesiveness sufficient to 
make them esthetic. The characteristic unity 
of the esthetic state is founded in large measure 
upon economical mental processes. Yet these must 
be synthesized into cohesive groups in order to 
satisfy the ideal demands of beauty. 
It is not necessary, however, that the individual 
parts of a work of art should conform to such an 
ideal. It is not an ideal object, but an ideal mean- 
ing, which the experience must afford. Details
-P-A-G-E-277
258 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
in themselves essentially ugly, depictions of pain 
and suffering, misshapen forms and discordant 
musical sequences, may all contribute to a beauti- 
ful effect, provided the meaning of the whole gives 
evidence of a conformity and relative perfection 
which can be contemplated. In English poetry, one 
of the most remarkable examples of this truth is 
Browning’s “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came”, 
while in the field of representative art some of 
Rodin’s sculpture furnishes striking illustrations. 
A®sthetic character is manifest in a peculiar 
susceptibility to those formal relationships making 
for contemplative adjustment. It is present in 
high degree in the mind of the artist, because it 
is his province to hold himself keenly alive to all 
experiences that may serve as a basis for artistic 
expression. But it is also cultivated in the 
appreciative lover of art, who secures his esthetic 
satisfaction in the vicarious products of the artist. 
The attitude involved is distinctly impractical, and, 
when developed to an excessive extent, often leads 
to marked defects in moral character. The type 
of mind which seeks only present conformities in 
experience is apt to lose interest in the more vigorous 
activities of voluntary control. The purpose of 
life ceases to inspire him, and he lives merely to 
gratify his sentimental cravings. Many brilliant 
artists have fallen into this slough of despond, and 
their careers have been wrecked because they have 
sacrificed all for the delight of the moment. 
On the other hand, as Schopenhauer has pointed
-P-A-G-E-278
CHARACTER 259 
out, the esthetic attitude has a supreme importance 
in providing a mode of retreat from the petty ills 
of existence. When its cultivation is not excessive, 
a means is afforded whereby we are able to regard 
with equanimity and sympathetic tolerance even the 
most poignant griefs and disappointments. Beauty 
abounds for all who have the eyes to see and the 
ears to hear it. Without the sense of beauty no 
true culture is attainable. 
86. Moral Character 
Moral character is based upon the syntheses of 
volition. Art, it has been said, is neither moral 
nor immoral. This is not entirely true, because 
it is impossible to hold our attitudes so rigidly 
apart. There need be no lack of esthetic appre- 
ciation in the true moral character. Indeed, 
the esthetic ideal of a conformable whole fuses 
with the ethical ideal of a perfect state of goodness. 
Sidney Lanier insisted that the beauty of holiness 
and the holiness of beauty, finally considered, 
mean one thing. The distinction between the two 
ideals is mainly that, for esthetic purposes alone, 
the goal may be achieved under existing conditions. 
It is, in other words, a proximate aim. The ethical 
ideal, on the other hand, is ultimate, and like the 
logical ideal, unattainable. 
Ethical values indicate discontent with the exist- 
ing state of things and a belief that by human effort 
conditions may be bettered. The effort to which 
ethical value attaches is, therefore, a voluntary
-P-A-G-E-279
260 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
effort. In the words of Kant, — “Nothing in 
the whole world, or even outside of the world, can 
possibly be regarded as good without limitation, . 
except a good will.” 
This furnishes us with the key to ethical char- 
acter. It is manifest in the good will. To be good 
in the sense necessary to a subjective evaluation, 
the voluntary act must be both known and felt 
as such. Ethical theorists have devoted much 
attention to the relative merits of knowing and feel- 
ing, as motives for good and bad acts. There 
are ethical doctrines of hoary antiquity still find- 
ing support which place the only valid motives for 
right living in a rational, rigoristic apprehension of 
needs. ‘These are the energistic doctrines. Funda- 
mentally opposed to them is another set of doc- 
trines, equally ancient and still accepted, which 
finds the sole motive for moral behavior in feelings 
of pleasure and displeasure. These are the 
hedonistic doctrines. 
But if our analysis of human behavior be correct, 
the ethical values of experience are conditioned 
neither by intellectual nor by affective moments 
alone, but by an attitude of mind which combines 
these two elements in a synthetic whole.. The ethi- 
cal attitude is a state of willing. It is, therefore, 
a state of self-consciousness in which the ego is 
confidently in control. It is not what one thinks 
or what one feels, but what one intends to do, that 
is of importance. Whether or not this intention 
is fulfilled in action is another matter. To con-
-P-A-G-E-280
CHARACTER 261 
stitute the act of will as a good act, there must at 
least be a sincere decision to undertake a line of 
conduct which is regarded as having ethical value. 
The agent in this volition must know the nature 
of his intention and feel its worth. The attitude 
of goodwill is therefore one involving self-con- 
sciousness. and a confidence of ability to perform 
the act in question. It also embodies an assurance 
that the deed is rationally in accordance with an 
ethical ideal, and a feeling of conformity as regards 
both the content and the performance of the act. 
This sense of assurance is dictated by what we 
term conscience. Conscience is the dispositional 
tendency to do right. It has its roots both in past 
experience and in the more fundamental instinctive 
purposes of behavior. It manifests itself intui- 
tively, é.¢., immediately as a direction of thought 
and behavior. : 
The question of free will enters into considera- 
tion here. How can we shape our conduct in a 
manner really to promote a state of goodness if 
we are not free agents? The question is philo- 
sophical rather than psychological, and we need not 
enter upon it in any detail. It will be well, how- 
ever, to note that a strictly mechanistic interpre- 
tation of mind deprives ethical values of real 
significance. The course of events, as mechanically 
determined, allows no place for better and worse. 
Accordingly, our apprehension of moral values is 
theoretically deprived of all true initiative in the 
achievement of an ideal goal.
-P-A-G-E-281
262 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
But we have found many reasons for denying 
that mind is rigidly set in a mechanical sequence 
of events. We have insisted from the start that 
its essential nature involves purposive direction. 
Hence, we are prepared to maintain that the self 
is, in some measure at least, a free agent in direct- 
ing both experience and behavior. It is, therefore, 
not contrary to psychological fact to regard the 
progressive evolution and attainment of an ethical 
ideal as possible. 
Moral character involves the initiation of acts 
of will which are dictated by conscience. This 
means that to will an act is to conform to an ideal 
of virtue. The conformity is both known and 
felt. The value which it has for us is revealed 
psychologically in these two ways: by its rational 
cogency, and by its sentimental conformity. — 
87. Religious Character 
When we turn to our last issue in psychology, 
a man’s religion, we are confronted with a type of 
character less readily described than the three 
with which we have been engaged. Religion, in 
its very essence, is something transcendent. The 
attitudes involved and the character thus developed 
partake of all the others we have defined. To 
quote Professor Stratton, we are now moving 
in a “region of value... where we affirm what 
is consistent, not with certain bare intellectual 
relations, as in mathematics, but with deep needs 
and impulses of our nature other than pure in-
-P-A-G-E-282
CHARACTER 263 
tellect.” We have already indicated that in reli- 
gious aspiration and ecstasy we seem at times 
to transcend the data and conditions of perception. 
‘*PDivinity,” as the same author well says, . is 
to be defined as the fulfilment, rather of that to 
which our emotion and purpose points.... They 
merely point toward it; they promise an experi- 
ence of perfection, which, however, can never be 
described.” 
The direction given by our ideal of a supreme 
power constitutes the aim of worship and the char- 
acter of the worshipper. Since the object is God, 
an omnipotent force, two different attitudes arise. 
The first involves an ecstatic union or at-oneness 
with God; the other awakens a sense of dependence 
upon his will. These two attitudes interplay 
with one another, and both have the common 
feature of being non-voluntary states of mind. In 
moments of ecstatic union with God it is his will 
which inspires us. We are God’s instruments, and 
his willis our will. In the moments of dependency, 
it is only God’s mercy which fills the soul. We 
are but cosmic fragments of little value, save that 
which his divine mercy may freely extend to us. 
The non-voluntary character of these states 
brings them closely into relation with the zsthetic 
state. Although the religious attitude may be one 
of contemplation, yet the objects contemplated 
transcend immediate experience. The intention of 
the attitude is not a perfect moment in concrete 
experience, but the awful sublimity of a supreme
-P-A-G-E-283
264 THE ISSUES OF PSYCHOLOGY 
power. It is this which occasions the mystical and 
ecstatic nature of religious experiences. The per- 
sonality is no longer the sole guiding force. We 
are directed beyond the concrete facts of everyday 
life into a realm of higher forces, in which personal 
independence is tacitly renounced. Religion is ac- 
cordingly defined by Professor Stratton as ‘‘man’s 
whole bearing toward what seems to him the Best, 
or Greatest, — where ‘best’ is used in a sense neither 
in nor out of morality, and ‘greatest’ is confined 
to no particular region.” 
88. General Conclusion 
With this brief summary of the religious char- 
acter, we bring to a close our slight attempt to trace 
some of the more important issues of Psychology. 
The attempt has been slight because it was not 
within the plan and scope of this elementary 
treatise to give more than the general bearings of 
Psychology upon the special fields of study which 
it approaches. It has not been our intention to 
introduce the student into the domains of Logic, 
sthetics, Ethics or Religion, nor even to outline 
the problems of Scientific Education, Sociology, 
or Animal Behavior. We have confined ourselves 
tather to the general principles of Psychology 
applicable in each of these fields. If we have 
succeeded in awakening an interest in the prob- 
lems of pure Psychology, and in helping the 
beginner to grasp them intelligently, our task will 
have been accomplished.

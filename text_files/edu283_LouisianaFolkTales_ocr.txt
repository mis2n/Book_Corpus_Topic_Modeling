PREFACE. 
  
Ir is with pleasure that the writer presents to folk-lorists his 
“ Louisiana Folk-Tales.” He has devoted several years to collecting 
his material and preparing it for publication, and he hopes that his 
book will be considered a useful contribution to the science of Folk- 
Lore. No attempt was made to make a comparative study of the 
tales, and they are presented to folk-lorists as material for compari- 
son. Andrew Lang said that the collector should himself eliminate 
the personal equation while writing his tales and not leave this task 
to his reader. Such has been the constant aim of the writer and 
of the persons who kindly assisted him in his work, and this collec- 
tion is the result of honest and conscientious efforts to give to the 
public genuine folktales. 
The tales are given first in the Creole dialect, then in a faithful 
but not literal translation, as it is desirable to preserve the interest 
of the story. The study of the Creole dialect is of importance and 
interest, and the tales have been carefully written in Louisiana 
dialect, in order that the material may be of use to the philologist. 
In the Appendix are reproduced fourteen stories already published 
in 1888 in the “ Transactions of the Modern Language Association 
of America,” and in the “Journal of American Folk-Lore,” to the 
end that the reader may have in one volume a complete collection 
of Louisiana Folk-Tales. 
The writer wishes to acknowledge his obligations and present his 
thanks to his nieces, Misses Désirée and Marguerite Roman, and to 
Mr. Zénon De Moruelle, who have assisted him in his collection. 
One of his most valued assistants has been Mrs. Widow V. Chop- 
pin, of St. James Parish, recently deceased. Thanks are also due 
to the Secretary of The American Folk-Lore Society, for suggestions 
in the preparation of this work.

INTRODUCTION. 
I. THE TALES. 
Ir is very difficult to make a complete collection of the negro tales, 
as the young generation knows nothing about them, and most of the 
old people pretend to have forgotten them. It is a strange fact that 
the old negroes do not like to relate those tales with which they 
enchanted their little masters before the war. It was with great 
trouble that I succeeded in getting the following stories. 
While reading these tales, one must bear in mind that most of 
them were related to children by childlike people ; this accounts for 
their zaiveté. The Louisiana folk-tales were brought over to this 
country by Europeans and Africans, and it is interesting to note 
what changes have been made in some well-known tales by a race 
rude and ignorant, but not devoid of imagination and poetical feel- 
ing. It is important to give the variants of popular tales principally 
to indicate the different characteristics of the human race. The 
study of folk-lore is interesting to the anthropologist and psycholo- 
gist. Both may follow the workings of man’s mind, of man’s feeling, 
through a number of countries and in primitive people. If we take 
any popular tale, we shall always find some difference in the impres- 
sion created on the audience. That impression reacts on the story 
itself and modifies it toa great extent. The plot of a popular tale 
seems to be the common heritage of a number of countries which 
may have derived it from the same source, but the motives are often 
inspired by local customs. 
In Louisiana we have three kinds of tales: the animal tales, of 
which some are, without doubt, of African origin; fairy tales or 
marchen, probably from India ; and tales and songs, real vaudevilles, 
where the song is more important than the plot. In this connection 
a negro dancing song or vonde may be mentioned as illustrating the 
way in which the tale with a song is related. In the vonde accom- 
panying the tale one man sings these almost meaningless words : 
“Crapaud entré on nid bourdon, et lapé chanter: ‘Yapé piqué moin, 
yapé mordé moin; Doune, ah! doune goule! Doune, ah! doune
-P-A-G-E-10
x Lutroduction. 
goule!’” “A frog enters into a hornets’ nest and he is singing: 
‘They are stinging me, they are biting me: Doune, ah! doune goule! 
Doune ah! doune goule!’”” While singing he writhes in a horrible 
manner and gesticulates wildly, rubbing his shoulders against all the 
persons present, who sing with him the refrain and dance to the 
tune of a most primitive music. 
Il. THE CREOLE DIALECT. 
The dialect spoken by the negroes in Lower Louisiana and known 
by philologists as the Creole dialect is an interesting subject for 
study. It is not merely a corruption of French, that is to say, 
French badly spoken, it is a real idiom with a morphology and 
grammar of its own. It is curious to see how the ignorant African 
slave transformed his master’s language into a speech concise and 
simple, and at the same time soft and musical. The tendency was, 
of course, to abbreviate as much as possible, both in the form of the 
words and in the construction of the sentence. The word arrété 
becomes rété; appeld, pélé; all parts of speech, not absolutely necessary. 
to the meaning, are thrown out of the sentence. There is hardly any 
distinction of gender, and the verb is simplified to a wonderful 
degree. The sounds of the French words vary considerably in the 
dialect ; the principal changes being the frequency in the dialect of 
the nasal sound zz and of 4 The process of agglutination is very 
common, as 7% larie, in dézo, a street, a bone. 
The first story of the collection will be used as a basis for the 
explanation of a few peculiarities of the Creole dialect. For a more 
complete treatment of the subject, see my “ Louisiana Studies,” 
Hansell, New Orleans, 1894.

THE ELEPHANT AND THE WHALE. 
One day Compair Lapin and Compair Bouki were going on a 
journey together. Compair Lapin often took Bouki with him to 
make fun of him, and to hear all the news which Bouki knew. When 
they reached the seashore, they saw something which was very . 
strange, and which astonished them so much that they stopped to 
watch and listen. It was an elephant and a whale which were. 
conversing together. 
You see,” said Bouki, “they are the two largest beasts in the 
world, and the strongest of all animals.” 
“Hush up,” said Lapin, “let us go nearer and listen. I want to 
hear what they are saying.” 
The elephant said to the whale: “Commére Baleine, as you are 
the largest and strongest in the sea, and I am the largest and strong- 
est on land, we must rule over all beasts; and all those who will 
revolt against us we shall kill them, you hear, commére.” 
“Yes, compair; keep the land and I shall keep the sea.” 
“You hear,” said Bouki, “let us go, because it will be bad for us 
if they hear that we are listening to their conversation.” 
“Oh! I don’t care,” said Lapin ; “I am more cunning than they ; 
you will see how I am going to fix them.” 
‘* No,” said Bouki, “I am afraid, I must go.” 
“Well, go, if you are so good for nothing and cowardly; go 
quickly, I am tired of you; you are too foolish.” 
Compair Lapin went to get a very long and strong rope, then he 
got his drum and hid it in the grass. He took one end of the rope, 
and went to the elephant: ‘Mister, you who are so good and so 
strong. I wish you would render mea service; you would relieve 
me of a great trouble and prevent me from losing my money.” 
The elephant was glad to hear such a fine compliment, and he 
said: “Compair, I shall do for you everything you want. I am 
always ready to help my friends.” 
“Well,” said Lapin, “I have a cow which is stuck in the mud on 
the coast; you know that I am not strong enough to pull her out; I 
come for you to help me. Take this rope in your trunk. I shall tie 
it to the cow, and when you hear me beat the drum, pull hard on

the rope. I tell you that because the cow is stuck deep in the 
mud.” 
“ That is all right,” said the elephant. “I guarantee you I shall 
pull the cow out, or the rope will break.” 
Compair Lapin took the other end of the rope and ran towards 
the sea. He paid a pretty compliment to the whale, and asked her 
to render him the same service about the cow, which was stuck in 
a bayou in the woods. Compair Lapin’s mouth was so honeyed that 
no one could refuse him anything. The whale took hold of the rope 
and said; ‘When I shall hear the drum beat I shall pull.” 
“Yes,” said Lapin, “begin pulling gently, and then more and 
more.” 
“You need not be afraid,” said the whale; “I shall pull out the 
cow, even if the Devil were holding her.” 
“That is good,” said Lapin; “we are going to laugh.” And he 
beat his drum. 
The elephant began to pull so hard that the rope was like a bar of 
iron, The whale, on her side, was pulling and pulling, and yet she 
was coming nearer to the land, as she was not so well situated to 
pull as the elephant. When she saw that she was mounting on land, . 
she beat her tail furiously and plunged headlong into the sea. The 
shock was so great that the elephant was dragged to the sea. 
“What, said he, what is the matter? that cow must be wonderfully 
strong to drag me so. Let me kneel with my front feet in the mud.” 
Then he twisted the rope round his trunk in such a manner that he 
pulled the whale again to the shore. He was very much astonished 
to see his friend the whale. “What is the matter,” said he, “I 
thought it was Compair Lapin’s cow I was pulling.” 
“Lapin told me the same thing. I believe he is making fun 
of us.” 
“He must pay for that,” said the elephant. “I forbid him to eat 
a blade of grass on land because he laughed at us.” 
“ And I will not allow him to drink a drop of water in the sea. 
We must watch for him, and the first one that sees him must not 
miss him.” 
Compair Lapin said to Bouki: “It is growing hot for us; it is 
time to leave.” 
“You see,” said Bouki, “you are always bringing us into trouble.” 
“Oh! hush up, I am not through with them yet; you will see 
how I shall fix them,”

They went on their way and after a while they separated. When 
Compair Lapin arrived in the wood, he found a little dead deer. 
The dogs had bitten him so that the hair had fallen off his skin in 
many places. Lapin took off the deer’s skin and put it on his back. 
He looked exactly like a wounded deer. He passed limping by the 
elephant, who said to him: “ Poor little deer, how sick you look.” 
“Oh! yes, I am suffering very much ; you see it is Compair Lapin 
who poisoned me and put his curse on me, because I wanted to pre- 
vent him from eating grass, as you had ordered me. Take care, 
Mr. Elephant, Compair Lapin has made a bargain with the Devil; 
he will be hard on you, if you don’t take care.” 
The elephant was very much frightened. He said, “Little deer, 
you will tell Compair Lapin that I am his best friend; let him eat 
as much grass as he wants and present my compliments to him.” 
The deer met a little later the whale in the sea. “ But poor little 
deer, why are you limping so; you seem to be very sick.” 
“Oh! yes, it is Compair Lapin who did that. Take care, Com- 
mére Baleine.” The whale also was frightened, and said: “I want 
to have nothing to do with the Devil; please tell Compair Lapia to 
drink as much water as he wants.” 
The deer went on his way, and when he met Compair Bouki he 
took off the deer’s skin and said: “You see that I am more cunning

COMPAIR TAUREAU AND JEAN MALIN. 
When Jean Malin was small he became an orphan, and he did not 
know where to go or what todo. One day he saw a rich lady who 
was passing in her beautiful carriage, and he asked her to take him 
with her. As the lady saw that he was a pretty little boy and that he 
appeared to be very smart, she asked him how old he was. Jean Malin 
could not say, but he answered the lady that he had heard his mother 
say that he was born when the peach-trees were in bloom the year 
the snow fell. The lady took him in her fine carriage to her house, 
to be her messenger boy and to wait at table. The little fellow soon

began to love the lady as if she were his mother, and he was jealous 
of a rich gentleman who came to court the lady every day and wished 
to marry her. 
But I must tell you that the gentleman was a bull who could 
change himself into a man in the daytime, to come and court the 
lady, and in the evening he became a bull again to go and eat grass 
in the park, Jean Malin had noticed that when the gentleman was 
near his lady love there was no bull in the prairie, and when the 
bull was in the prairie there was no lover in the parlor. “TI will 
have to watch,” said Jean Malin, “there is something strange which 
I don’t understand.” He watched, watched, but he took good care 
not to let Compair Taureau see him. One day, early in the morn- 
ing, when Jean Malin went to get some wood to light his fire, he 
saw Compair Taureau on his knees, and saying: “ Bouhour, Madjam, 
fat Madjam, djam, djam, djara, djara,” and then, all at once, the bull 
became a man, and went to see his lady. Ah! I tell you, Jean 
Malin was afraid, he shivered as if he was very cold. 
That very morning the lover took breakfast with the lady and 
Jean Malin waited on them. He ran sometimes on one side, some- 
times on the other, as a butterfly, he was so frightened. When 
they asked him for a plate, he gave bread on a fork, and the lady 
scolded him. She told him, when the lover left, that she would 
send him away if he did not do better, and she wanted to know what 
was the matter with him. 
“TI know you don’t like my lover, but why? What did he do to 
you? He always treated you well.” 
“Well, I will tell you, mistress. I am afraid; and if you knew 
what I know you would be afraid also, and you would not let that 
man enter your house.” 
“What is the matter? Tell me immediately or I shall whip you, 
and put you out for da guiappe.” 
Jean Malin began to cry, and he said to the lady: “Know then 
that your lover is the great bull which is in the park, and that he 
can change himself into a man and become a bull again to go and 
eat grass.” 
The lady was very angry and wanted to beat Jean Malin; but he 
said : “Mistress, listen tome. When your lover will come again, if I 
don’t prove to you that all I say is true, you can send me away and 
do what you please with me.” 
“ All right,” said the lady; “ but remember that you will pay dear 
for all your lies.” 
A few days after that the lover came. He was dressed in great 
style, and Jean Malin said to himself: “I will see the fun to-day,”

because he knew what to say to make the lover become a bull 
again. 
While they were dining the lady kept looking at Jean Malin to-see 
what he would do. When the gentleman took the pretty fingers 
of the lady to hiss them, Jean Malin, who was pouring wine into her 
glass, said the words he had heard the bull utter. Well, if ever you 
heard a big noise it was on that day: the hat, the trousers, the spec- 
cles, the coat, all the clothes of the gentleman fell on the floor, and 
he was changed into a bull in the dining-room. He upset the table, 
broke the plates, the dishes, the glasses, the bottles; he broke down 
the glass door to escape, and ran into the prairie. 
“Well, are you satisfied?” said Jean Malin. 
“Yes,” said the lady; “you rendered me a great service, and I 
shall always treat you as my son.” 
You believe that this is all? Ohno, You will see how Jean Malin 
got along with the bull which had sworn to kill the fellow that had 
betrayed him. The boy was always afraid, and whenever he went 
out he would look around to see if the bull was not there. One day 
he went to see Compair Lapin, to ask his advice, and told him in 
what a bad fix he was. 
Compair Lapin said: “ Listen to what I am going to tell you. Go 
into the woods and look for an owl’s nest.. Take three eggs on 
a Friday at sunset and bring them to me for me to charm them. 
Then you will do all you want with Compair Taureau.” 
Jean Malin found the three owl’s eggs and carried them to Com- 
pair Lapin, who made his grigris on them with the milk of a black 
goat, and told Jean Malin what to do. 
When Jean Malin was going back to the house of his mistress, he 
looked around for the bull, for he felt a little anxious, in spite of 
what Compair Lapin had said. There was the bull, bellowing and 
looking furious, “Come,” said Jean Malin, “ you will see how I am 
going to fix you.” Compair Taureau galloped straight at him, and 
Jean Malin climbed up a tree, for he thought it was more prudent. 
In one minute, like a squirrel, he was at the top of the tree and the 
bull stood underneath. 
“ Now I have you at last: you will have to come down,” and he 
began to strike at the tree with his horns,

Jean Malin laughed at him, and the bull was so angry that he 
knelt down and said the words to become aman. He immediately 
was changed into a man with an axe in his hand. 
“Come down! don’t let me cut the tree ; for I will kill you, little 
rogue.” 
“Cut, Compair Taureau; I want to see what you can do.” 
The bull struck with his axe: “gip, gop.” You might have seen 
the tree tremble at every blow. Then Jean Malin threw one of the 
owl’s eggs on Compair Taureau’s shoulder, and his arm fell down on 
the ground with the axe. The man picked up the axe with his 
other hand, and “ gip, gop,” on the tree. 
Jean Malin threw the second egg on the remaining arm of the 
man, and. the arm fell on the ground. He picked up the axe with 
his teeth, “gip, gop,” again. 
“Now,” said Jean Malin, “I will finish you.” He threw his third 
egg on the man’s head, and the head fell on the ground. The arms, 
the legs, the head, the body of the man, began to wriggle like a 
snake in the fire. Then Jean Malin said: “I want you to become a 
bull-again.” He said the magic words, and the head and the arms 
jumped to the body, and the man became a bull again and galloped 
away in great haste. From that time he never worried Jean Malin 
again, for his grigvis had not been as strong as that of Compair 
Lapin.

COMPAIR LAPIN AND THE EARTHWORM. 
Everybody knows that every year in the month of May Compair 
Lapin is sick; it is an earthworm which is in his neck, biting him 
and sucking his blood like a leech. That makes him weak, weak, 
and for a month the worm holds on to him, hooked in his neck, 
before it falls. Rabbits believe that when they lie down in the 
grass the worms come out of the grass and climb on them. They 
are, therefore, very much afraid of worms, and if they see one, they 
run as if they had a pack of hounds after them. If I tell you that 
it is because I want to relate to you a story about Compair Lapin 
and the worm.

  Compair Lapin et Ver de Terre. 15 
It was a day in spring, the little birds were singing, the butterflies 
were flying about from one flower to another. It seemed as if all 
animals were rendering thanks to God for his kindness to them, A 
little earthworm was the only one which was crying and complain- 
ing. He said he was so small, he had neither feet, nor hands, nor 
wings, and was obliged to remain in his hole. The little birds, the 
lizards, and even the ants were troubling him and eating his little 
ones. If God would make him big and strong, like other animals, 
then he would be contented, because he would be able to defend 
himself, while now: he was helpless in his hole. He cried and cried 
and said that he would be glad if he belonged to the Devil. Hardly 
_ had-he spoken when he saw the Devil at his side. 
“Well, I heard all you said; tell me what you want; I shall 
grant it to yeu, and you will belong to me when you die.” 
“What I want ?— Yes. —I want strength, I want to become big, 
big, and beat everybody who will come to trouble and bother me. 
Give me only that and I shall be satisfied.” . 
“That is all right,” said the Devil; “let me go, in a short while 
you will be contented.” 
As soon as the Devil had gone, the worm found himself strong 
and big. The change had come suddenly, and his hole had become 
large and as deep as awell. The worm was so glad that he began to 
laugh and to sing, At that very moment Lapin passed, and he was 
terribly frightened. He ran until he was unable to go any farther, 
and, when he stopped, he whistled, “ fouif.” “Never,” said he, “ was 
I more frightened. I shall never sleep again as long as that big 
earthworm will remain in this country. If 1 had not been so foolish 
as to boast that I could beat the elephant, I should go to him. It is 
Bouki who told on me; but perhaps if I speak to him I shall be able 
to fix up matters. I must try to make them meet and fight, and 
perhaps I shall get rid of both at the same time. It would bea 
pretty fight. Let me go and see the elephant, or I won’t be able to 
sleep to-night. Besides, the earthworm szid that he would fix me. 
I can’t live that way. Good gracious! what am I todo? Let me 
arrange in my head what I am going to tell the elephant in order 
to please him.” 
He went on until hz met the elephant. He bowed very politely, 
and the elephant did likewise, and asked him how he was. 
Oh! Iam very sick,” said Compair Lapin ; “another time I shall 
come to try my strength with you; I think I can beat you.” 
“You are a fool,” said the elephant. “Go away, I don’t want to 
harm you; I take pity on you.”

“T-bet you,” said Compair Lapin, “that I can beat you.” 
“ All right, whenever you want.” 
“A little later; but as I know that you are good, I had come to 
ask you a favor.” 
“What is it?” 
“Tt is to help me, to give me a hand to carry lumber to build my 
cabin.” 
“ Let us go right off, if you want.” 
Compair Lapin, who had carried his axe with him, cut down a 
big tree, and said to the elephant: “Take it by the big end. I shall 
raise the branches, and we shall carry the tree to the place where I 
wish to build my cabin.” 
The elephant put the tree on his shoulder without looking behind 
him, and Compair Lapin climbed into the branches, and let the ele- 
phant do all the work. When the latter was tired he would stop to 
rest a little, and Compair Lapin would jump down and run up to the 
elephant to encourage him. “How is that, compair, you are already 
tired; but that is nothing. Look at me, who have been working as 
much as you. I don’t feel tired.” 
“ What! that is mightily heavy,” said the elephant. 
“ Let us go,” said Lapin; “we have not far to go.” 
The big animal put the load again on his back and Compair Lapin 
appeared to be lifting the branches. Whenever the elephant would 
not be looking Lapin would sit on a branch and say: “A little 
farther ; go to the right, go to the left.” 
At last they came to the hole of the earthworm, and Lapin told 
the elephant to put down the tree. He let it fall right upon the 
worm who was sleeping. The latter pushed out the tree as if it 
were a piece of straw, and coming out he began to insult the ele- 
phant. Compair Lapin went to hide in a place where he could see 
and hear all. The elephant lost patience and struck the worm with 
his trunk. 
The worm then climbed up the back of the elephant, and there 
was a terrible fight for more than two hours, until they were nearly 
dead. The worm finally hid in his hole and the elephant lay down” 
dying. Compair Lapin mounted upon him, pulled his ears and beat 
him, and said to him: “Didn't I tell you I would beat you?” 
“Qh! yes, Compair Lapin; I have enough; I am dying.” 
Lapin then left him, and, going into the worm’s hole, he broke 
his head with a stick. “‘ Now,’’ said he, “I am rid of both of them.”

A little later Compair Lapin met Compair Bouki and told him 
how he had made the elephant and the earthworm fight until they 
had killed one another. ‘“ You see, my friend, when two fellows are 
in your way, you must make them fight, then you will always save 
your skin,”

COMPAIR LAPIN AND COMPAIR L’OURS. 
One day Compair lOurs invited Compair Lapin and Compair 
Bouki to dine with him. He told them he had bought butter, cheese, 
and biscuits, but he said: “Before dinner you must come to help 
me break some corn for my horse.” 
Compair Lapin and Compair Bouki accepted the invitation of | 
Compair l’Ours, and all three went into the field before daybreak, 
At nine o'clock they saw Compair Lapin prick up his ears. 
What is the matter?” said Compair 1’Ours. 
“TI never saw anything so annoying as the people at my house. 
They are calling me and disturbing me in my work.” 
“T don’t hear anything,” said Compair I’Ours. 
“Tt is because you and Compair Bouki have such small ears that 
you can’t hear. My ears are so long that I hear miles away.” 
He went away and came back a moment later, saying it was for 
his wife who was beginning to be sick. He did the same thing 
three times during the day. At noon he said his wife was in the 
middle of her sickness, at three o’clock he came back very sad, and 
said merely: “ All is finished.” 
Compair l’Ours and Compair Bouki pitied him very much because 
they thought it was his wife who was dead. Instead of that, each 
time Compair Lapin had said he was going to his wife’s house he 
went to the house of Compair I’Ours and ate a little of his provi- 
sions, and when he said: “It is finished,” hé had finished eating all. 
At five o'clock the three friends left their work and went to the 
house of Compair l’Ours. You may imagine how Compair |’Ours 
was angry when he saw that all his provisions had disappeared. 
Immediately he accused Compair Lapin, but he swore it was not he. 
“T shall know right off; all three of us will go and lie down on 
that plank which is in the water in the sun, and the thief will surely 
be sick.” Compair Lapin, who was very impudent, said yes, because 
he expected to lie down in the shade by the side of Compair I’Ours, 
who was much larger than he. Compair Bouki said yes also.

They went to the plank, and Compair Lapin was not pleased when 
he saw that it was the stage of a boat, and he would not be able to 
stick to Compair I’Ours to be in the shade. They lay down on the 
plank, at a distance from one another, and no sooner were they there 
when Compair Lapin felt very sick on account of the water and the 
sun, and he began to throw up all that he had eaten. 
“Ah! I have caught you, comrade,” said Compair l’Ours. “You 
will pay for that, and I am going to hang you.” 
“ Hang me if you wish, I don’t care,” said Compair Lapin ; “ but if 
you want I shall give you a good way. Make a hole in the wall, 
pass the rope through it, you and Compair Bouki will not be in the 
sun to pull the rope and hang me. While you will be hanging me I 
shall cry, and when I shall not cry it will be a sign I have no voice 
left and I shall be dead.” 
Compair l’Ours did what Compair Lapin had said and tied him, 
but when Compair l’‘Ours and Compair Bouki were in the house, he 
untied himself and hung by his feet. Compair I’Ours pulled on the 
rope, Compair Lapin cried loud, then so low that Compair l’Ours 
and Compair Bouki thought he was dead, and they went to see on 
the other side of the wall. They only saw the dust Compair Lapin 
was making, and they heard his voice saying: “You see I am 
smarter than you, and I thank you for the good dinner I had at your 
house.”

THE IRISHMAN AND THE FROGS. 
Once upon a time there was a drunken Irishman who was return- 
ing to his village and who passed by a little river where were many 
frogs. He heard the frogs say: “Brum, brum, brum!” “Ah!” 
said the Irishman, “you want my rum; I shall give you a little, 
but you must promise me to give back my jug. But tell me, is the 
water deep there?” 
“Jou, jou, jou!” said the frogs. “Oh!” said the Irishman, 
“that is not very deep. Here is my rum.” He threw his jug into 
the water and he waited a good while, then he said: “ Well, gentle- 
men, send back my jug; it is late, I must go back home; they are 
waiting for me.” But the frogs did not send back anything. Then 
the Irishman threw himself into the water that was very deep and 
came to his neck. 
“Confounded liars,” said the Irishman, “ you told me the water 
would come to my knees (gezoux), and it is up to my neck.” 
As he was drunk, he was drowned.

COMPAIR LAPIN AND MADAME CARENCRO. 
Do you know why buzzards are bald? No. Well, I am going to 
tell you. 
Once upon a time Mme. Carencro was setting upon her nest on 
an oak-tree. Her husband was a good-for-nothing fellow, and she 
was always starving. At the foot of the tree there was a big hole 
in which a rabbit dwelt. Compair Lapin was large and fat, and 
every time Mme. Carencro saw him she wished to eat him. One day, 
while Compair Lapin was sleeping, she took some moss and bricks 
and closed the hole in the tree. Then Compair Lapin would not be 
able to get out and would die of hunger. 
When Compair Lapin woke up and he found out that he was shut 
up in the hole, he begged Mme. Carencro to let him out, but she 
replicd each time: “I am hungry and I must eat the flesh’ on your 
bones.” 
When Compair Lapin saw that it was of no use to beg, he stopped 
speaking, but Mme. Carencro was so glad she had caught Compair 
Lapin that she licked her lips when she thought of the good dinner 
she would make. As she did not hear Compair Lapin move, she 
thought he was dead, smothered, and she took away the moss and 
the bricks which closed the hole. She began to go down the opening, 
but Compair Lapin made one jump and got out. When he was at 
some distance he said: ‘You see, it is you who are caught, and 
not I.” 
He ran away and went to stay at the house of one of his friends, 
because he was afraid to go back into the oak-tree near Mme. Caren- 
cro. Some days later Mme. Carencro, who had forgotten Compair 
Lapin, went to take a walk with her children, who had all come out 
of their shells. They passed near the house of Compair Lapin’s 
friend. Compair Lapin was glad, and he thought how he could take 
vengeance on Mme. Carencro. He ran into the kitchen, he took a 
large tin pan full of burning embers and hot ashes ; and when Mme. 
Carencro and her children passed near the gallery, he threw down 
on them all that he had in the tin pan, in order to burn them. But 
you know that buzzards have thick feathers except on the top of 
their heads. They shook off the embers and ashes, but not quick 
enough to prevent the feathers on their heads to burn down to the 
skin. 
This is why the buzzards are bald and never eat bones of rabbits.

COMPAIR LAPIN AND MR. TURKEY. 
Every evening when Compair Lapin returned from his work he 
passed through a yard where there was a large turkey sleeping on 
its perch, and like all other turkeys that one also had its head under 
its wing to sleep. 
Every evening Compair Lapin stopped to look at the turkey, and 
he asked himself what it had done with its head. Finally, one even- 
ing, he was so curious that he stopped underneath the perch, and 
said: “Good evening, Mr. Turkey.” 
“Good evening,” said the turkey, without raising’ its head. 
“Do you have a head, Mr. Turkey?” 
“Yes, I have a head.” 
“ Where is it?” 
“ My head is here.” 
Compair Lapin looked in vain, but he could not see Mr. Turkey’s 
head. As he saw that the turkey did not want to talk to him or 
show him where was its head, he went to his house and said to his 
sister: “Do you know that to go to sleep turkeys take off their 
heads? Well, I believe I shall do the same thing, because it is less 
trouble to sleep without a head, and one can speak without a head, 
for the turkey spoke to me.” 
Before his sister had the time to tell him anything, he took an axe 
and cut off his head. His sister tried in every way possible to stick 
it on again, but could not do so, as her brother had killed himself.

the monkeys pulled him out as soon as he said “I am cooked.” 
The monkeys, in their turn, jumped into the kettle, and cried out, 
immediately on touching the water, “ We are cooked.” Bouki, how- 
ever, took his big blanket, and covering the kettle, said: “If you 
were cooked you could not say so.” One little monkey alone es- 
caped, and Bouki ate all the others. Some time after this Compair 
Bouki was hungry again, and he called the monkeys : 
Sam-bombel! Sam-bombel tam! 
Sam-bombel! Sam-bombel dam! 
When the monkeys came, he jumped into the kettle again and 
said: “I am cooked, I am cooked.” The monkeys, however, which 
had been warned by the little monkey which had escaped the first 
time, did not pull Bouki out, but said: “If you were cooked you 
could not say so.”

A gentleman who was living on the banks of a bayou caught a 
large tortoise, and went immediately to invite some friends to take 
dinner with him. His little boy, in his absence, went to the cage 
where was. the tortoise, and the latter began to whistle. “How well 
you whistle!” said the child. “Oh! that is nothing; open the 
cage, and you will see.’ The boy opened the cage, and the tortoise 
whistled better than ever. The boy was delighted. “Put me down 
on the floor and you will see,” said the tortoise. The boy did so, 
and the tortoise danced and sang. “Oh! how well you dance and 
sing!” said the boy. “ Put me on the bank of the bayou, and you 
will see,” said the tortoise. The boy took her to the bayou, and the 
tortoise danced and sang. . All at once she disappeared in the water, 
and the boy began to cry. The tortoise rose in the middle of the 
bayou and said: “ Learn not to trust, hereafter, people whom you do 
not know.” 
The boy was afraid of his father, and put a large flat stone into the 
cage. The cook, thinking it was the tortoise, put the stone into the 
kettle. She was astonished to see it remain hard so long, and she 
called her master’s attention to it. He ordered the tortoise to be 
put upon the table, and he took his table knife to cut it. It was in 
vain. He took the carving-knife, in vain. He took the hatchet, in 
vain. He took the axe, he broke the dishes, the table, but the tor- 
toise remained intact. He then saw it was a stone, and to this day 
he has: not understood how his tortoise was changed into a stone.

COMPAIR BOUKI, COMPAIR LAPIN, AND THE BIRDS’ 
EGGS. 
Compair Bouki and Compair Lapin were neighbors. One day 
Compair Bouki said to himself that he wished to see what Compair 
Lapin was cooking every evening in his cabin. He went to Com- 
pair Lapin’s cabin and saw a big kettle on the fire. “Oh! what a 
toothache I have! Compair Lapin, what do you have in that 
kettle ?” : 
“Tt is not your business, Compair Bouki.” 
“What smells so good in that kettle, Compair Lapin? Oh! what 
a toothache I have!” 
“It is birds’ eggs, Compair Bouki; don’t bother me.” 
“Oh! what a toothache I have! Let me taste what you have 
here. It will cure me.” 
Compair Lapin gave him a few eggs, and Compair Bouki found 
them so good that he wished to know where they were to be found. 
Compair Lapin told him he would take him with him the next day. 
Compair Bouki went home and told his mother that he hada 
splendid supper at Compair Lapin’s. His mother told him to open 
his mouth that she might smell what it was that he had eaten. She 
then took a small piece of wood and scraped off the teeth of Com- 
pair Bouki the small pieces of eggs that remained there. 
“Oh! how good it is,” she said ; “ you must get me some.” 
Compair Bouki went early the next morning with Compair Lapin, 
who showed him where the eggs were and told him not to take more 
than one from each nest, because the birds would perceive it. Com- 
pair Bouki, however, as soon as Lapin was gone, took all the eggs 
from every nest. When the birds returned and saw that all the 
eggs had been stolen, they were furious, and formed a plan to avenge 
themselves. There was in the wood a bayou which was the only 
place where the animals could drink. The birds placed themselves 
around the bayou and saw an ox coming. 
“Compair Bef, was it you who ate our eggs ?” 
“No, my friends, I eat nothing but grass.” 
The horse said he ate nothing but hay. Compair Lapin said that 
he ate nothing but carrots and lettuce; but when they questioned 
Compair Bouki, he replied foolishly: “Yes, it is I who ate your 
eggs.” 
No sooner had he spoken when the birds fell upon him ; they put 
out his eyes and nearly tore him to pieces.

THE DOG AND THE TIGER. 
A dog one day bought one hundred hens and one rooster, and a 
tiger bought one hundred roosters and one hen. Every evening the 
dog found a basketful of eggs in his chicken-house, and the tiger 
found only one egg. The tiger accused the dog of robbing him, 
and, tying him up, he put him in a wheelbarrow and took him along 
to sell him. On the way he met a deer, and relating his story to 
him, he asked him if he was not right to sell the dog. The deer 
said “no,’’ whereupon the tiger killed him. A little later he met a 
lion, and related his story to him. The lion said the tiger was 
wrong and the latter replied, “You speak in that way because you 
know that you are stronger than I.” 
After some time the tiger went into the woods and left the dog 
alone for a few minutes. Some hunters passed by, and they asked 
the dog what he was doing there. He related his story, and the 
hunters asked him to show them where the tiger was. The tiger 
was terribly frightened, and from that time dogs have never been 
afraid of wild beasts.

Once upon a time Compair Lapin was working for Compair 
Bouki. The latter had bought:a barrel of butter, and had hidden it 
in his cellar. The two companions were working one. day in the 
field together, when, all at once, Lapin raised his head, and said: 
“They axe calling me to be godfather to a child.” 
“Go immediately,” replied Bouki; “you must not make them 
wait.” 
Lapin ran off, and when he returned, Bouki said to him: ‘“ Well, 
did you baptize the child? How did you call him?” 
“T called him ‘ Begun.’” 
“ Indeed, that is a strange name.” 
A little later, Lapin raised his head again, and said: “They are 
calling me again to be godfather to another child.” 
“Go,” said Bouki; “ you cannot tell them no.” 
Compair Lapin ran off again, and remained away longer than the

this time?” 
“T called him ‘ Half.’” 
“Half! But what name is that? I never heard such strange 
names as those which yeu give the children baptized by you.” 
A little later again, while they were working, Lapin raised his 
head, and said: “There, they are calling me again for another child ; 
it is very annoying ; I shall never be able to finish my work.” 
“ Go,” said Bouki; ‘t you cannot say no.” 
Lapin ran off, laughing to himself. 
When he returned, Botki said: “ What is the name of the child?” 
“Oh! I called him ‘All Finished,’ because I do not want to be 
godfather to any other child.” 
Now, Bouki said to himself: “I must have a good dinner; let me 
fill my butter dish with my good butter.” He looked into his barrel, 
there was nothing in it. Lapin had eaten all the butter. 
“Oh! that is too much,” said Bouki; “he will pay me for that.” 
He caught Lapin, he tied him with a rope, and said: “ Now, what 
am I going to do with you? I’ll throw you in the river.” 
“Ah! yes, that is what I like.” : 
“No, you are too glad; Ill throw you in the fire.” 
“Ah! yes, throw me in the fire.” 
“No, you are too glad; I’ll throw you in the briers.” 
“Oh! I pray you, my dear Bouki, do not throw me in the briers.” 
“Yes, it is there you must go.” 
Bouki threw Lapin in the briers. As soon as he fell, he cut the 
rope with his teeth, and ran away, crying: “Thank you, my good 
Bouki; you placed me exactly where my mother resides,”

MARRIAGE OF COMPAIR LAPIN. 
Tim, tim! Bois sec. Cré coton! Compair Lapin is a little 
fellow who knows how to jump! 
You all must remember, after they had thrown Compair Lapin 
inte the briers, how quickly he had run away, saying that it was in 
those very thorns that his mother had made him. Now then, I will- 
tell you that on the same day Miss Léonine went to meet him, and 
they started travelling. They walked a long time, for at least a 
month; at last they reached the bank of a river which was very 
deep. The current was strong, too strong for them to swim over. 
On the other side of the river there was a pretty place: the trees 
were green and loaded with all kinds of fruits. Under the trees 
were flowers of every kind that there is in the world. When a per- 
son breathed there, it was as if a bottle of essence had been opened 
in a room. 
Miss Léonine said : “ Let us go to live there; besides, we cannot 
return to my father’s. There, we shall be happy, and no one will 
bother us ; but how shall we do to cross over to the other side?” 
“Stop,” said Compair Lapin, “let me think a moment,” and then 
he began to walk and walk, until he saw a large piece of dry wood 
which had fallen into the water. “That is what I want,” said he. 
He cut a tall pole, and then he mounted on the log and told Léonine 
to follow him. Poor Miss Léonine mounted also, but she was so 
much afraid that she was trembling dreadfully. 
“Hold on well; you will see how we shall pass ;” and he pushed 
with his stick. The log began to go down the current; they were 
going like lightning, and Lapin kept on paddling. They sailed for 
half a day before they were able to reach the other side, for the 
current was so strong that the log was carried along all the time. 
At last it passed very near the shore. “Jump, jump,” said Compair 
Lapin, and hardly had he spoken than he was on shore. Miss 
Léonine finally jumped also, and they found themselves on the other 
side of the river. They were very glad, and the first thing they did 
was to eat as much as they could of the good things they found 
there. Then they took a good rest. 
They found a pretty place to pass the night, and the next day, at 
dawn, they took a good walk. As everything they saw was so fine, 
they thought they would remain there to live. When they had run 
away, they had not been able to take any money with them, so they

were without a cent. But God had blessed them, for they had come 
to a place where they did not need much money. They had already 
been there a good while, and they were quiet and contented, and 
they thought that they were alone, when one day, they heard, all at 
once, a noise, a tumult, as if thunder was rolling on the ground. 
“What is that, my lord? Go to see, Compair Lapin.” 
“I, no, as if I am foolish to go, and then catch something bad. 
It is better for me to stay quiet, and, in that way, nothing can 
happen to me.” 
The noise kept on increasing, until they saw approaching a proces- 
sion of elephants. As they were passing quietly without attacking 
any one, it gave Compair Lapin a little courage. He went to the 
chief of the elephants and told him that he asked his permission to 
remain in his country; he said that he came from the country of 
King Lion, who had wanted to kill him, and he had run away with 
his wife. 
The elephant replied: “ That is good; you may remain here as 
long as you want, but don’t you bring here other animals who know 
how to eat one another. As long as you will behave well, I will 
protect you, and nobody will come to get you here. Come some- 
times to see me, and I will try to do something for you.” 
Some time after that, Compair Lapin went to see the king of 
elephants, and the king was so glad when Compair Lapin explained 
to him how he could make a great deal of money, that he named 
immediately Compair Lapin captain of his bank and watchman of 
his property. 
When Compair Lapin saw all the money of the king it almost 
turned his head, and as he had taken the habit of drinking since 
they had dug in his country a well, of which the water made people 
drunk, he continued his bad habit whenever he had the chance. 
One evening he came home very drunk, and he began quarrelling 
with his wife. Léonine fell upon him and gave him such a beating 
that he remained in bed for three weeks. When he got up, he asked 
his wife to pardon him; he said that he was drunk, and that he 
would never do it again, and he kissed her. In his heart, however, 
he could not forgive Léonine. He swore that he would leave her, 
but before that he was resolved to give her a terrible beating. 
One evening when Léonine was sleeping, Compair Lapin took a 
rope and tied her feet before and behind. In that way he was sure 
of his business. Then he took a good whip, and he whipped her 
until she lost consciousness. Then he left her and went on trav- 
elling. He wanted to go to a place where they would never hear 
of him any more, because he was afraid that Léonine would kill 
him, and he went far.

Mariaze Compair Lapin. 43 
When Miss Léonine came back to herself, she called, she called ; 
they came to see what was the matter, and they found her well tied 
up. They cut the ropes, and Léonine started immediately. She 
left her house, she travelled a long time, until she came to the same 
river which she had crossed with Compair Lapin upon the log. She 
did not hesitate, but jumped into the water. The current carried 
her along, and she managed, after a great many efforts, to cross 
over to the other side. She was very tired, and she had to take 
some rest; then she started to return to her father. 
When her father saw her, he kissed her and caressed her, but his 
daughter began to cry, and told him how Compair Lapin had treated 
her. When King Lion heard that, he was so angry that all who 
were near him began to tremble. 
Come here, Master Fox; you shall go to the king of elephants, 
and tell him, that if he does not send Compair Lapin to me as soon 
as he can, I shall go to his country to kill him and all the elephants, 
and all the other animals, and everything which is in his country. 
Go quick!” 
Master Fox travelled a long time, and arrived at last in the coun- 
try where Compair Lapin was hidden. But he did not see him; he 
asked for him, but no one could give him any news of him. Master 
Fox went to see the king of elephants and told him what King 
Lion had said. The elephants hate the lions, so the king replied: 
“Tell your master that if he wishes me to break his jaw-bone, let 
him come. I shall not send anything or anybody, and first of all, 
get away from here quick. If you want good advice, I can tell you 
that you had better remain in your country. If ever Lion tries to 
come here, I shall receive him in such a manner that no one of you 
will ever return home.” 
Master Fox did not wait to hear any more; but he had no great 
desire to go back to his country, for he thought Lion would kill him 
if he returned without Compair Lapin. He walked as slowly as he 
could, and all along the road he saw that they were making prepara- 
tions for war. He thought that perhaps the elephants were going 
to attack King Lion. He went on his way, and on arriving at.a 
prairie he saw Compair Lapin, who was running in zigzags, some- 
times on one side of the road, sometimes on the other. He stopped 
whenever he met animals and spoke to them, and then he started 
again as rapidly as before. At last Master Fox and Compair Lapin 
met, but the latter did not recognize his old friend. 
“Where are you going like that, running all the time?” 
“Ah!” replied Compair Lapin, “you don’t know the bad news. 
Lion has declared war against all elephants, and I want to notify all 
mules, horses, and camels to get out of the way.”

“But you, why are you running so? They are surely not going 
to make a soldier of you?.” 
“No, you believe that. Ah, well, with all your cunning you know 
nothing. When the officers of the king will come to get the horses 
and mules for the cavalry to go to war, they will say; ‘That’s a 
fellow with long ears; he is a mule; let us take him.’ Even if I 
protest, and say that I am a rabbit, they will say: ‘Oh, no! look at 
his ears ; you see that he is a mule,’ and I should be caught, en- 
listed, and forced to march. It seems to me that I know you, but 
it is such a long time since I have seen you. May God help me, 
it is Master Fox, my old friend!” 
“Yes, yes, it is I, my good fellow. Well! what do you say about 
all that bad business?” : 
“ All that is for a woman,” said Compair Lapin; “we must try, 
my friend, to have nothing to do with that war.” 
“But what shall we do?” said Master Fox. “They will force 
us into it.” 
“No, you must be King Lion’s adviser, and I will be that of 
King Elephant, and in that way we shall merely look on and let 
them fight as much as they want.” 
“You know,” said Master Fox, “ Léonine has returned to her 
father; and as you were not married before the church, I believe 
that Lion is about to marry her to one of his neighbors. Does it 
not grieve you, Compair Lapin, to think of that?” 
“Oh, no; ¢a 2t¢ pas oua tcheur pas fait mal (we feel no sorrow 
for what we do not see).” 
The two cunning fellows conversed a long time, for they were 
glad to. meet after such a long absence. As they were about to part, 
they saw two dogs, that stood nose to nose, growling fiercely, and 
then turned around rapidly and began to smell each other every- 
where. 
“You, Master Fox, who know everything, can you tell me why 
dogs have the bad habit of smelling each other in that way?” 
“T will tell you, Compair Lapin, why they do that. In old, old 
times, when there was but one god, called Mr. Jupiter, all the dogs 
considered their lot so hard and unhappy that they sent a delegation 
to ask Mr. Jupiter to better their condition, When they arrived at 
the house of the god in heaven, all the dogs were so frightened that 
they ran away. Only one remained; it was Brisetout, the largest 
dog of the party. He was not afraid of anything, and he came to 
Mr. Jupiter, and spoke thus: ‘My nation sent me to see you to ask 
you whether you think that we are going to watch over our masters 
all day and all night, bark all the time, and then be kicked right and 
Jeft and have nothing to eat. We are too unhappy, and we want to

know if you will allow us once in a while to eat one of the sheep of 
our masters. We cannot work like this for nothing. What do you 
say, Mr. Jupiter?’ 
«Wait a moment: I shall give you such a reply that you will 
never wish to annoy me any more. I am tired of hearing all sorts 
of complaints. I am tired, do you hear?’ 
“Then Mr. Jupiter spoke a language that no one could under- 
stand, and one of his clerks went out to get something. He told 
the dog to sit down. Brisetout remained on the last step of the 
staircase. He thought that Mr. Jupiter was going to give hima 
good dinner ; but the first thing he knew, the clerk returned with 
another man. They took hold of Brisetout, they tied him well, then 
they took a tin pan in which they put eS pepper and turpentine. 
They rubbed the dog all over with the mixture; it burnt him so 
much that he howled and bellowed. hen they let him go, Mr. 
Jupiter told him: ‘ You will give my reply to your comrades, and 
each one that will come to complain will be received in the same 
manner; you hear?’ 
“ Ah, no, Brisetout did not hear; he ran straight ahead without 
knowing where he was going. At last he arrived at a bayou, fell 
into it, and was drowned. 
“ Some time after that, Mr. Jupiter did not feel well. He thought 
he would leave heaven and take a little trip to earth, On his way 
he saw an apple-tree which was covered with beautiful apples. He 
began to eat some; and while he was eating, a troop of dogs came 
to bark at him. Mr. Jupiter ordered his stick to give them a good 
drubbing. The stick began to turn to the right and to the left, and 
beat the dogs so terribly, that they scattered about in a minute. 
There remained but one poor dog, who was all mangy. He begged 
the stick to spare him. Then Stick pushed him before Mr. Jupiter, 
and said: ‘ Master, that dog was so‘thin that I did not have the 
courage to beat him.’ ‘It is very well,’ said Mr. Jupiter, ‘let him 
go; but if ever any dog comes to bark at me again, I shall destroy 
them all. I don’t want to be bothered by you, I say. You have 
already sent me a delegation, and I received them so well that I 
don’t think they will like to come back to see me. Have you 
already forgotten that?’ The poor lean dog replied: ‘What you 
say is true, but we never saw again the messenger we sent you; 
we are still waiting for him.’ Mr, Jupiter then said: ‘I will tell 
you how you can find out the messenger you had sent to me: let 
all dogs smell one another, and the one which will smell turpentine 
is the messenger.’ 
“ You see now, Compair Lapin, why dogs smell one another. It

was all Mr. Jupiter's doing. Poor old fellow, he has now lost all his 
clients, since the pope ordered everybody to leave him, and he has 
had to close his shop. He left the heaven, and no one knows where 
he went to hide. You understand, Compair Lapin, people get tired 
of ‘having always the same thing ; so they took another religion, and 
I think that the one we have now is good.” 
“Thank you, thank you, Master Fox, for your good story ; and in 
order to show you that I am your old friend, I will tell you what we 
can do. As I told you already, we must remain very quiet. As the 
elephants want to go to attack King Lion in his own country, they 
will make a bridge for the army to pass. When the bridge will be 
finished they will go straight ahead, without stopping anywhere, to 
attack King Lion, for they want to take him by surprise. Don’t 
you tell that to anybody, you hear.” 
Compair Lapin and Master Fox then shook hands,’and they 
parted. Master Fox went on his way, and Compair Lapin went to 
the king of elephants and asked him to give orders to all the car- 
penters and blacksmiths in the country to obey him. When all the 
workmen were assembled, Compair Lapin began to make the bridge, 
and soon finished it. On the side of the river which was in the 
country of the elephants, he made at the end of the bridge a large 
park. These were bars of iron planted in the earth; they were at 
least ten feet high, and so sharp that a fly could not touch one with- 
out being pierced through. Compair Lapin then covered the bars 
of iron with branches and brambles to make it appear like a patch of 
briers, in order that they might not know that it was a snare. Then 
he took four cows with their calves, and tied them in the very mid- 
dle of the pit. Then he put in it red pepper, ashes, and tobacco 
snuff. Then he placed in the trap a great number of tubs of water, 
in which there was a drug that made péople go to sleep right off. 
After he had finished all this, Compair Lapin:said: “ Now let King 
Lion come to attack us.” 
Master Fox was still travelling to render an account of his errand 
to King Lion; but he was so much afraid to return without Compair 
Lapin, that he concluded that it was better not to return at all. On 
his way he met a hen; he killed it, and covered an old rag with the 
blood. He tied his hind paw with the rag, and he began to limp, 
and jump on three feet. At last he met Bourriquet, to whom he 
said: “ My dear friend, render me a little service ; you see how sick 
Iam. I pray you to go to King Lion, to tell him that I cannot come 
tosee him. The elephants broke my leg because I had come to:claim 
Compair Lapin.” 
“Oh, no!”’ said Bourriquet; “you were always against me with 
Compair Lapin. Go yourself.”

“That is good,” said Master Fox; “c'est pas jis ein fois la bouche 
besoin manger (I shall have my chance again, you will need me again). } 
If you knew what I have seen and what I know, you would listen to 
me,” 
“Well, tell me all,” said Bourriquet; “and I will go, since you 
cannot walk.” 
“That is all right; listen well. The elephants intend to come to 
attack King Lion in his country. They are making a bridge to 
cross the river, and as soon as the bridge will be finished they will 
come immediately to surprise Lion. If the king understood his 
business, he would hasten to attack the elephants in their own 
country, before they come to lift him up before he knows it.” 
As soon as Master Fox had finished speaking, Bourriquet galloped ; 
away and went to King Lion, to whom he said what Master Fox had 
related to him. The king was so glad that he ordered some one to 
give Bourriquet a little hay to eat. Bourriquet was not very much 
pleased, and he began grumbling. “Don’t you know, Bourriquet,” 
said the king’s servant, “gué ein choual donnin to doite pas gardé

given to you).”

plein ti zozos quapé voltigé dans bois (a bird in the hand is better 
than two in the bush).” - 
All at once they heard a dreadful noise. It was King Lion, who 
was starting for the war with all the animals which he could find: 
tigers, bears, wolves, all King Lion’s subjects were there. As to 
Master Fox, he had run back to notify Compair Lapin that the ene- 
mies were coming. 
Miss Léonine was with the army, and her father used to tell her 
all the time: “I am glad that you came; Compair Lapin will have to 
pay for all his tricks ; you must treat him as he treated you.” 
King Lion was at the head of the army, and coming near the 
bridge he saw Master Fox, who was lying in the road with his leg 
broken. 
“Oh! oh!” said Lion, “this is the way they treated you! They 
shall have to pay for all that.” 
“Make haste,” said Master Fox; “don’t wait till they come to 
attack you; pass the bridge immediately ; that will throw them in 
confusion.” 
The army went on. They all ran to pass over the bridge, King 
Lion at the head, with his daughter. As soon as they arrived at the 
place where was the snare, and they saw the cows and their calves, 
King Lion and his troops killed them and began to eat them. Then

they quarrelled among themselves and began to fight. They scat- 
tered about the ashes, the red pepper, and the tobacco snuff, and 
were completely blinded. They fought terribly; they massacred 
one another; then those that were left drank the water in the tubs, 
Two hours later they were all sound asleep. 
The elephants, which had remained prudently at a distance, hear- 
ing no more noise, came to the bridge. They killed all the animals 
that were left in Lion’s army, and threw their bodies in the river. 
They flayed King Lion; they took his skin and sewed Bourriquet 
into it ; then they tied some straw, covered with pitch, to Bourriquet’s 
tail; they put fire to the straw, and they let him go to announce the 
news in Lion’s country. 
When Bourriquet passed on the bridge, he was galloping so fast 
that one might have thought that it was thunder that was rolling on 
the bridge, as if it were more than one hundred cart-loads. When 
Bourriquet arrived in his country his tail was entirely consumed by 
the fire, but he said that he had lost it in a battle. Although he 
announced very sad news, no one could help laughing at him: he 
was so funny without his tail, and so proud of his glorious wound. 
As soon as all was over at the bridge, Compair Lapin went to get 
Master Fox, and took him to the king of the elephants. He pre- 
sented him to his majesty, and told him that Master Fox was his good 
friend, and if the king wanted to accept his services, they would both 
be his very faithful subjects. The king of elephants said to them: 
“T believe that you are two cunning rascals, and that in my war 
with King Lion, Master Fox ¢é galpé avec chévreil et chassé avee 
chien (had been on both sides of the fence) ; but all right, he may 
remain here, if he wants. As for you, Compair Lapin, I want you 
to get married. Here is Miss White Rabbit; she is rich, and will be 
a good match for you. To-morrow I want to dance at the wedding.” 
‘The next day all the people assembled, and celebrated with great 
gplendor the marriage of Compair Lapin with Miss White Rabbit. 
Master Fox was the first groomsman. Three weeks after the wed- 
ding, Mrs. Compair Lapin gave birth to two little ones; one was 
white and the other as black as soot. Compair Lapin was not 
pleased, and he went to see the king of elephants. 
“Oh! you know nothing,” said the king ; “ you are married before 
the church, and I will not grant you a divorce. Besides, I must tell 
you that in the family of Mrs. Compair Lapin it happens very often 
that the little ones are black. It is when the ladies are afraid in a 
dark night ; so console yourself, and don’t be troubled.” 
Compair Lapin consented to remain with his- wife until death 
should part them, and that is how he married after all his pranks. 
As I was there when all that. happened, I ran away to relate it to 
you,

KING PEACOCK. 
‘here was once a lady who-was so pretty, so pretty that she 
never wanted to marry. She found something to criticise in all the 
suitors who presented themselves, saying of them: “Oh, you are 
too ugly.” “You are too small.” “ You have too large a mouth.” 
One day a fine man came; he was in a golden carriage, drawn by 
eight horses. He asked the lady to marry him, but she, refused: 
He fell into a passion, and told her that in one year she would: have 
a daughter that would be much, much prettier than herself.. Fhe 
lady sent him away with scorn. 
Well, a year later she had a pretty little girl. When she saw that 
the child was so pretty, she shut her up in 2 room at the further 
end of the house, with her nurse to attend to her. As the girl grew: 
up she became handsomer every day. The nurse never allowed her 
to leave her room, or even to look through the window. One day, 
however, while the old woman was sweeping the floor, she left the 
door open, and the young girl saw a large bird. 
“Nurse,” said she, “how do- you call that bird which is so 
pretty?” 
The woman was obliged to reply, and said: “That is a peacock.” 
“If ever I marry, I want to marry King Peacock.” 
“May God hear you, my child.” 
That very day the mother came, called the nurse into a: corner, 
drew from under her skirt a great knife, and said, “I want you to 
kill my child. She has become prettier than I.” 
The nurse began-to cry, and begged the lady to spare the poor 
child, but all in vain; that black heart could not be softened. When 
night came, the nurse said to the girl: “ My poor child, I have te 
kill you, your mother wants you to die.” 
The girl was so good that she replied: “ Well, kill me, nurse, if 
my mother wants it to be so.” 
But the nurse answered: ‘No,-I have not the heart to do any 
such thing, my little one. Here, take these three seeds, throw your 
self in the well and drown yourself ; but before jumping in the well, 
swallow one of these seeds, and you will not suffer at all.” 
The girl thanked the nurse, and went to drown herself. She 
walked until she arrived at a large well. She threw herself info it,

but before touching the water she took one of her seeds to put it in 
her mouth, The seed, however, fcll in the water, and immediately 
the well dried up. The young lady was very sorry to see that there 
was no water left in the well, and getting out she walked as far as a 
wood, in which she found a small house. She knocked at the door, 
and an old woman showed herself. When she saw the pretty young 
girl, she said: “Oh! my child, what do you come to do here? 
Don’t you know that my husband is an ogre? He will eat you 
up!” 
Then the girl answered: “That is what I want. My mother wants 
me to die.” 
The woman replied: “ If that is the case, come in, but it is a great 
pity.” 
The poor girl sat down in a corner, and cried while she was wait- 
ing for the ogre. All at once they heard big footsteps, and as soon 
as the door was opened, the ogre said: “ My wife, I smell fresh 
meat in here,” and he ran towards the young girl. She, however, 
merely looked at him with her large eyes, and he stepped back, say- 
ing to his wife: “Do you think that I can eat such a pretty girl? 
She is so beautiful that I want to look at her all the time.” 
The girl said she was tired, so the ogre took her to a beautiful 
room, and ordered his wife to fan her with peacock feathers while 
she would be sleeping. , 
The young lady said to herself: “It is better for me to die now, 
for perhaps the ogre will change his mind to-morrow and will eat 
me.” She put one of her seeds in her mouth, and fell in a deep 
sleep. She slept and slept, and the ogre’s wife was fanning her all 
the time. When three days had passed, and she did not awake, the 
ogre looked at her, and said: “It is a great pity, but I believe she is 
dead.” He went to the town, and brought a coffin all made of gold. 
He put the girl in it, and placed it on the river. The coffin then 
went floating down the river. Very far away, King Peacock was 
one day on the levee, with all his princes, to enjoy the cool breeze, 
when he saw something shining in the river. He ordered his cour- 
tiers to see what that was. They took a skiff, and exclaiming, “It 
is a coffin,” they brought it to the king. When he saw the pretty 
young girl, who appeared to be sleeping, he said, “‘ Take her to my 
chamber,” for he wished to try to awaken her. He put her on a bed 
and rubbed her hands and face with cologne water, but to no avail. 
Then he opened her mouth to see what pretty teeth she had. He 
saw something red in her front teeth, and tried to take it off witha 
golden pin. It was a seed which fell on the floor. The young girl 
awoke and said, ‘I am so glad to see you.” 
The king replied: “I am King Peacock, and I want to marry

THE SINGING BONES. 
Once upon a time there lived a man and a woman who had twenty- 
five children. They were very poor ; the man was good, the woman 
was bad. Every day when the husband returned from his work the 
wife served his dinner, but always meat without bones. 
“ How is it that this meat has no bones?” 
“Because bones are heavy, and meat is cheaper without bones. 
They give more for the money.” 
The husband ate, and said nothing. 
“ How is it you don’t eat meat?” 
“You forget that I have no teeth. How do you expect me to eat 
meat without teeth?” 
“That is true,” said the husband, and he said nothing more, be- 
cause he was afraid to grieve his wife, who was as wicked as she was 
ugly. 
When one has twenty-five children one cannot think of them all 
the time, and one does not see if one or two are missing. One 
day, after his dinner, the husband asked for his children When 
they were by him he counted them, and found only fifteen. He 
asked his wife where were the ten others. She answered that they 
were at their grandmother’s, and every day she would send one more 
for them to get a change of air. That was true, every day there 
was one that was missing. 
One day the husband was at the threshold of his house, in front of 
a large stone which was there. He was thinking of his children, and 
he wanted to go and get them at their grandmother’s, when he heard 
voices that were saying : 
Our mother killed us, 
Our father ate us. 
We are not in a coffin, 
We are not in the cemetery. 
At first he-did not understand what that meant, but he raised the 
stone, and saw a great quantity of bones, which began to sing again. 
He then understood that it was the bones of his children, whom his 
wife had killed, and whom he had eaten. Then he was so angry that 
he killed his wife ; buried his children’s bones in the cemetery, and 
stayed alone at his house. From that time he never ate meat, be- 
cause he believed it would always be his children that he would eat.

JEAN SOTTE. 
There was once a fellow who was so foolish that everybody called 
him Jean Sotte. He was so simple that every one made fun of him. 
He would light the lamp in daytime, and put it out at night; he 
would take an umbrella with him only when it was very dark. In 
summer he would put on a great coat, and in winter he would go 
nearly naked. In short, he did everything contrary to common 
sense, King Bangon, who loved to play tricks, heard of the sayings 
and deeds of Jean Sotte, and sent for him to amuse his friends. 
When Jean came to the king all began to laugh, as he looked so 
awkward. The king asked him if he knew how to count. Jean 
replied that he knew how to count eggs; that yesterday he had found 
four and two. ‘How much does that make?” said the king. Jean 
went to count the eggs, and on returning said there were four and 
two. 
“Exactly,” said the king, “ but tell me, Jean Sotte, they say that 
Compair Lapin is your father?” 
* Yes, he is,” 
“No, no,” said some one else; “I think it is Compair Bouki.” 
“Yes, yes,” said Jean Sotte; “it is he also.” 
“No, no,” said an old woman who was passing ; “it is Renard who 
is your father.” 
“Yes,” said Jean Sotte, “all of them; they are all my fathers. 
Every time one of them passes by me he says, ‘Good-morning, my 
child.’ I must believe, then, that they are all my fathers,” 
Everybody: laughed at Jean Sotte; then the king said: “Jean 
Sotte, I want you to bring me to-morrow morning a bottle of bull’s 
milk. It is to make a drug for my daughter, who is sick, and has a 
sideache in her back.” 
“ All right,” said Jean Sotte, “to-morrow morning early I shall 
bring it.” 
King Bangon then said : — 
“On the first of April, in one month, you will come. I want you 
to guess something. If you guess, I will give you my daughter in 
marriage, but if you try three times, and do not succeed, my execu- 
tioner will have to cut your neck.” 
“All right,” said Jean Sotte, “I will try.” And then he went 
away, pretending to go and get the bull’s milk. 
When he reached home, he related to his mother all that had hap-

pened, and the old woman began to cry, and could not be consoled, 
because, however foolish her boy was, she loved him, as he was her 
only child. She forbade him to go to the king, and threatened to 
tie him in her cabin, or to have the sheriff throw him in prison. 
Jean Sotte paid no attention to his mother, and started before day- 
break, with his axe on his shoulder. He soon arrived at the house 
of the king, and he climbed into a big oak-tree which was before the 
door. He began, “ caou, caou, caou,” to cut down the branches with 
his axe, and he woke up everybody in the house. One of the ser- 
vants of the king came out to see what was the matter; and when 
he saw Jean Sotte on the top of the tree, he said: “ But what is 
your business there? Fool that you are, you are disturbing every- 
body.” 
“It is not your business, — do you hear?” said Jean Sotte. “Are 
you the watch-dog to be barking thus in the yard? When your 
master, King Bangon, comes, I will tell him what I am doing here.” 
The king came out, and asked Jean Sotte what he was doing 
there. He replied that he was cutting the bark to make some tea 
for his father, who had been delivered the day before of two twins. 
“What!” said the king, “for whom do you take me, Jean Sotte. 
Where did you ever hear of a man in childbirth? I think you mean 
to make fun of me.” 
“How is it that yesterday you asked a bottle of bull’s milk? If 
you were right, I am also.” 
The king replied: “I believe that you are not so foolish as you 
want to make people believe. Go to the kitchen, and they will give 
you your breakfast. Don’t forget to come on the first of April, that 
we may see which of us will be the April fool.” 
On the first of April Jean Sotte mounted his horse and went out 
without his mother seeing him. Compair Bouki, who is deceitful 
and evil-minded, said: “I shall prevent Jean Sotte from going, 
because I know he is so foolish that they will cut his neck and keep 
his horse. It is better that I should profit by it, and take his horse. 
Don’t you say anything ; you will see what I shall do.” 
He took a large basket full of poisoned cakes, and put it ona 
bridge where Jean Sotte was to pass. “If he eats those cakes, he 
will die, and I shall take the horse.” 
Bouki knew that Jean Sotte was greedy and that he would surely 
eat the cakes. Compair Lapin liked Jean Sotte, because one day, 
when he was caught in a snare, Jean Sotte had freed him. He did 
not forget that, and said: “I want to protect the poor fellow,” and

before daybreak he waited on the road for Jean Sotte. When he 
saw him, he said: “ Jean Sotte, I am coming to render you a ser- 
vice, listen to me: don’t eat or drink anything on your way, even if 
you are dying of hunger and of thirst ; and when the king will ask 
you to guess, you will reply what I am going to tell you. Come 
near; I don’t want anybody to hear.” 
Compair Lapin then told him what to say. “Yes, yes, I under- 
stand,” said Jean Sotte, and he began to laugh. 
“Now,” said Compair Lapin, “don’t forget me when you marry 
the king’s daughter; we can have good business together.” 
“Yes,” said Jean Sotte, “I shall not forget you.” 
“Well, good luck, pay attention to all you see, look on all sides, 
and listen well.” 
Then Jean Sotte started, and a little while afterwards he arrived 
at a bridge on the river. The first thing he saw was the basket full 
of cakes which Compair Bouki had placed there. They smelled 
good and they were very tempting. Jean Sotte touched them and 
felt like biting one, but he remembered what Compair Lapin had 
told him. He stopped a moment and said: “Let me see if they 
will do harm to my horse.” He took half a dozen cakes and gave 
them to his horse. The poor beast died almost immediately and fell 
on the bridge. “See, if I had not been prudent, it is I who would 
be dead instead of my horse. Ah! Compair Lapin was right; a 
little more and I should have been lost. Now I shall have to go on 
foot.” 
Before he started he threw his horse into the river; and as the 
poor beast was being carried away by the current, three buzzards 
alighted on the horse and began to eat him. Jean Sotte looked at 
him a long time, until he disappeared behind the point in the river. 
“Compair Lapin told me: ‘listen, look, and don’t say anything ;’ 
all right, I shall have something to ask the king to guess.” 
“When Jean Sotte came to the king nobody was trying to guess, 
for all those who had tried three times had been put to death by the 
king’s executioner. Fifty men already had been killed, and every 
one said, on seeing Jean Sotte: “There is Jean Sotte who is going 
to try, they will surely cut off his head, for he is so foolish. But so 
much the worse for him if he is such a fool.” 
When he saw Jean Sotte the king began to laugh and told him 
to come nearer. “What is it,” said he, “that early in the morning 
walks on four legs, at noon on two, and in the evening on three 
legs?”

“Tf I guess, you will give me your daughter ?” 
“Yes,” said the king. 
“Oh! that is nothing to guess.” 
“ Well, hurrah ! hurry on if you don’t want me to cut your neck.” 
Jean Sotte told him, it was a child who walked on four legs; 
when he grew up he walked on two, and when he grew old he had 
to take a stick, and that made three legs. 
All remained with their mouths wide open, they were so aston- 
ished. 
“You have guessed right; my daughter is for you. Now, let 
anybody ask me something, as I know everything in the world; if I 
do not guess right I will give him my kingdom and my fortune.” 
Jean Sotte said to the king: “I saw a dead being that was carry- 
ing three living beings and was nourishing them. The dead did not 
touch the land and was not in the sky ; tell me what it is, or I shall 
take your kingdom and your fortune.” 
King Bangon tried to guess ; he said this and that and a thousand 
things, but he had to give it up, Jean Sotte said then: “ My horse 
died. on a bridge, I threw him into the river, and three buzzards 
alighted on him and were eating him up in the river. They did not 
touch the land and they were not in the sky.” 
Everybody saw that Jean Sotte was smarter than all of them to- 
gether. He married the king’s daughter, took his place, and gov- 
erned the kingdom. He took Compair Lapin as his first overseer, 
and hanged Compair Bouki for his rascality. After that they 
changed Jean Sotte’s name and called him Jean I’Esprit.

THE DEVIL’S MARRIAGE. 
One day there was a pretty young girl, but she was very proud, 
and every time the young men came to court her, she found a pre- 
text to send them away. One was too small, another was too tall, 
another had red hair ; in short, she refused all her suitors, One day 
her mother said to her: “ My daughter, you see that tall, tall tree in 
the middle of the river? Iam going to put this pumpkin on the 
smallest branch at the top of the tree, and that young man who will 
be able to climb up and catch the pumpkin will be your husband.” 
The daughter said she had no objection, so they put a notice in

the newspapers. The next week a crowd of young men presented 
themselves, and amoung them one who was beautifully dressed and 
exceedingly handsome. He was the Devil, but novody knew him. 
The young girl told her mother: “I wish he would catch the 
pumpkin.” 
All the young men climbed on the tree, but no one could succeed 
in reaching the pumpkin. When the turn of the Devil came, in one 
minute he was up the.tree, and had the pumpkin in his hand. As 
soon as he was down he said to the young girl: “ Come now, come 
with me to my house.” 
The girl put on her best dress and went away with the Devil. 
On the road they met a man, who said to the Devil: “ Give me my 
cravat and my collar which I had lent to you.” 
The Devil took off his cravat and his collar, and said: “ Here, 
take your old cravat and your old collar.” A little further on, 
another man saw the Devil and told him: “Give me my shirt 
which I had lent you.” The Devil took off his shirt and said: 
“ Here, here, take your old shirt.” A little further, he saw another 
man, who said to him: “Give me my cloak which I had lent to 
you.” The Devil took off his cloak, and said: “Here, here, take 
your old cloak.” A little further, another man asked for his trous- 
ers, then another one for his hat. The Devil took off the trousers 
and the hat, and said: “ Here, here, take your old trousers and your 
old hat.” He came down from his carriage and disappeared for a 
few minutes, then he returned as well dressed as before. 
The young lady was: beginning to be very much frightened when 
they met another man, who said: “ Give me my houses which I had 
lent to you.” The Devil gave him his four horses, and said to his 
wife: “Get down from the carriage and hitch yourself to it.” She 
drew the carriage as far as the Devil’s house, and was so frightened 
that her heart was almost in her mouth. 
The Devil entered his garden, and said to his wife: “ Remain 
here with my mother.” As soon as he was gone the mother said 
to the young lady: “ Ah! my daughter, you have taken a bad hus- 
band ; you have married the Devil.” 
The poor girl was so sorry that she did not know what to do, and 
she said to the old woman: “Can you not tell me howI can run 
away?” The old woman replied: “ Yes, wait until to-morrow morn- 
ing; but come, let me show you something.” She opened the door 
of a little room, and said: “ Look, my daughter.” The girl looked 
in the room, and what did she see? A number of women hanging 
from a nail, She was so frightened that she asked the old woman 
if she could not hide her somewhere until the next morning. The

woman said: “Yes, but let me tell you how you can escape from 
here. When the Devil tells you to give one sack of corn to his 
rooster which wakes him up in the morning, you will give him three 
sacks that he may eat more and not crow so early, Then you will 
go to the chicken house and take six dirty eggs. Take care not to 
take clean eggs; that will bring you bad luck.” 
The next morning the young lady gave the rooster three sacks of 
corn, she took her eggs, and ran away. When the rooster had fin- 
ished eating his three sacks, he crowed: “Mr. Devil, awake quickly ; 
some one has run away from the house!” The Devil got up quickly 
and started running after his wife. The poor girl looked behind 
her, and saw smoke and fire—indeed, the Devil himself. She took 
an egg and broke it : a high wooden fence arose in the middle of the 
road. The Devil had to return home to get his golden axe to cut 
down the fence. After he had broken down the fence he took his 
axe to his house. 
The girl looked behind her; she saw smoke and fire —the Devil 
himself. She broke another egg: there grew up an iron fence. 
The Devil went home to get his golden axe, and had to take it 
back after breaking the fence. 
The girl looked again ; there was fire and smoke. She broke 
another egg: a great fire rose up in the road. The Devil went to 
get his jar of water to put out the fire, and then had to take the jar 
back. 
The girl heard again a noise; it was fire and smoke. She broke 
another egg: a brick wall grew up. The Devil went to get his 
golden axe, and carried it back after breaking the wall. 
The girl looked again: she saw fire and smoke. She broke 
another egg: a small river appeared, in which was a small canoe. 
She entered the canoe and crossed the river. The Devil was 
obliged to swim across. 
The girl looked again; she saw fire and smoke. She broke 
another egg: a large river appeared. There was a big crocodile on 
the other side of the river warming himself in the sun. The girl 
sang: “Grandmother, I pray you, cross me over; grandmother, I 
pray you, save my life.” The crocodile said: “ Climb on my back, 
my little one, I shall save your life.” 
The Devil saw in what way the girl had crossed the river, so he 
said to the crocodile: “Cross me over, crocodile; cross me over.” 
The crocodile replied: “Climb on my back; I shall cross you over.” 
When he reached the middle of the river, he dived under the water, 
and the Devil was drowned.

When the girl had left her mother’s house with her husband, her 
mother had said to her: “ Well, my child, what do you wish me to 
do with your old white horse?” The girl said to her mother: “I 
don’t care what you do; put him out in the pasture and let him 
die if he wants to.” However, when she crossed the river on the 
crocodile’s back, she saw her old horse in the pasture, and she said 
to him: “I pray you, old body, save my life!” The horse replied : 
“Ah, you want me now to save your life; did you not tell your 
mother to let me die, if I wanted? Well, climb on my back, I shall 
carry you to your mother.” 
The girl soon reached her mother’s house. She got down from 
the horse and kissed him, then she kissed her mother. She re- 
mained at home after that, and did not wish to marry again, after 
having had the Devil for her husband.

THE LITTLE FINGER. 
Before we came here, poor devils, we were all free, we were not 
obliged to work for any master. It is the whites who came into our 
country, Africa, to get us. They stole some of us; they bought some 
of us from our fathers for a red handkerchief, for a bottle of tafia, or 
an old gun. When we went to war those who were caught were 
sold to the whites who came to trade on the seacoast. We were 
led away, tied together, tied two by two ; and when we reached the 
seacoast like a herd of cattle, men, women, and children, we were 
exchanged, not for money, but for any kind of merchandise, and 
the whites put.us into ships and brought us here. This is how we 
became slaves in America, 
When Manga, my grandmother, arrived at the seacoast, she saw 
a pretty little town with small houses. There were many ships, 
and they seemed to be dancing on the sea; some were going up, 
others down. It was the wind, you know, that was blowing and 
shaking up the sea. My poor grandmother, who was young then, 
was afraid when she saw they were putting all the negroes on board 
the ships. She thought they were going to drown them in the sea. 
A white man came to her and bought her from her master. He 
took her to his house and told her in her own language: “I bought 
you to take care of my little boy.” He had a pretty house with a 
store in it, and a pretty garden. Behind the house was an orange 
grove, and the trees were so large that there was a fine shade under-

neath. To show you how my grandmother’s country was a good 
one, I will tell you that the orange-trees were in bloom the whole 
year; there were flowers and little oranges and ripe oranges all 
the time. The house was near the sea, and every morning Manga 
took little Florimond to take a bath. The little boy was so pretty, 
and his father and mother were so good, that Manga would not have 
left them for anything in the world. She loved little Florimond so 
much ; his hair was curly, his eyes were blue, his skin was white and 
rosy. Everybody adored the poor little boy, he was so pretty and 
smart. He could sing so well and imitate all birds so admirably 
that often they thought it was the Nita that was singing in the 
trees. Nita is a little bird in Africa which sings at night when the 
moon is shining. It perches on the top of the tallest tree; and if 
there is a light breeze it sings better, for the swinging of the 
branch helps the little bird to sing, as the rocking of the hammock 
helps a man’s lullaby. Florimond imitated the Nita so well that 
everybody was mistaken, and it amused the boy very much. 
Florimond’s father used to trade with the negroes that lived far in 
the woods, so one day he started to get gold dust and elephants’ 
teeth. On leaving he said to Manga: “Take good care of my wife 
and my little boy. You know I gave you already a pair of shoes; I 
will give you, on my return, a fine dress and a necklace.” The first 
time Manga put on her shoes they hurt her so much that she could 
hardly walk. She took them off on arriving at the house, and sat on 
the steps looking at her toes: “Wiggle, wiggle, poor things,” she 
said, “ you were in prison just now: you are free now, you are glad, 
is it not? Oh! I shall never shut you up again. Idon’t understand 
how white folks can put their toes in such things!” From that 
time Manga never put shoes on. 
Well, the master went into the big woods, and three days after- 
wards the lady said to Manga to take Florimond to the sea and give 
him a bath. While the little boy was playing with the shells and 
the white sand, they saw a skiff with several persons come ashore. 
A white man disembarked, and passed by Manga, and she felt a 
peculiar sensation, as if some misfortune was to happen. The eyes 
of the man shone like those of a cat in the dark. As he passed, he 
said: “Good morning, Florimond,” but the little boy did not reply 
anything. When they arrived home the lady sent them to play in 
the yard, and every time the master was away the strange man would 
come to the house. Florimond did not want to see him, and he said 
one day he would tell his father about the stranger. The latter said 
to Manga: “You little black imp, if ever you open your mouth 
about what you see here, I will cut your tongue with my big knife ; 
then I will carry you to my ship, sew you up ina sack, and throw

you into the sea for the fish to eat you.” Manga was so frightened 
that she would not have said a word even if they had whipped her 
for a whole day. In the evening Florimond cried so much that it 
was with great difficulty that Manga succeeded in putting him to 
sleep. Her cot was near the bed of the little boy, and during the 
night she saw the pirate enter the room with a big stick. He struck 
the little boy on the head and said: “ He is dead, I will put him in 
the hole which I dug in the yard. Now I must attend to the black 
girl.” 
Manga, however, had already run away into the yard ; but the man, 
thinking that she was in the road, ran out to catch her. Florimond’s 
mother came into the room, took the little boy’s body in her arms, 
and buried him in a hole near the place where Manga was. She was 
not quite through with her ugly work when she heard a noise and 
ran away. She met the man, who said: “ I believe the girl has gone 
to the woods; we need not trouble about her any more; the lions 
and tigers will soon eat her up. Now I must go on board my ship, 
and when I come back I will take you with me.” 
The lady went into the house, and Manga came out of her hiding- 
place. She felt so weak that she could hardly stand, but before she 
left she kissed the ground where her dear little master was buried, 
She said: “Farewell, little angel,” and ran into the woods. She 
preferred to stay with the wild animals than with the cruel mother. 
After walking for some time as fast as she could, she stopped by a 
bayou in the wood, drank some water, and sat downto rest. She 
fell asleep, but. soon she was awakened by loud talking. She saw 
some men standing around her, and among them was her master, 
who seemed to be very angry: “ What are you doing here so far 
from my house? I left you to take care of my little boy. I sup- 
pose you did something wrong and ran away.” Manga did not reply 
anything, because she remembered the threats of the pirate. The 
master ordered his men to bring her back to his house, and he 
hastened to go home. He found his wife, who was weeping bit- 
terly, and she said to him: “Oh! what a dreadful misfortune! 
Manga let Florimond fall on his head, and our poor little boy is 
dead. I wanted to kill the negress, but she ran away, and I don’t 
know where she is. If ever I catch her I will strangle her with my 
own hands.” 
When the poor man heard that his dear boy was dead, he fell in a 
swoon. They put him in bed, and he remained fifteen days deliri- 
ous. During that time the lady said to Manga that she would kill 
her if she opened her mouth. She shut the girl in a cabin, and gave 
her nothing but bread and water. 
At last Florimond’s father got out of bed, but he would not be

consoled, and he wept all day for his little boy. As Manga was still 
in her prison, her master did not see her,.and did not think of her. 
One day as he was walking about in the yard, he looked from time 
to time at his dear boy’s grave, and tears flowed from his eyes. In 
the mean time the Nita was singing on a tree near by, and its song 
was so sad that the poor man felt more sad than ever. It seemed 
to him it was his Florimond who was singing, and he came to the 
grave and looked at it a long time. All at once the poor father 
thought he was dreaming. He saw something that was so strange 
that many people will not believe it ; but so many people told me the 
same story, that I believe it is as sure as the sun is shining. When 
the lady had buried the little boy, she had not had tinie to cover the 
body completely, and one little hand was out of the grave, and it 
was the pretty little finger which was moving as if it was making a 
sign to call some one. The little finger moved on one side and then 
on the other, and never stopped beckoning, so to say. The poor 
father dug up the earth with his hand and uncovered the body. He 
found it as fresh as if it had just been buried, and he took it in his 
arms and carried it to the house. He put the boy on a bed and 
rubbed him so long that the child came back to consciousness. The 
father sent for a surgeon, who began to attend to the boy, and said 
that he would revive. There was no danger for his life, as the skull 
was not broken; the child was only in a state of lethargy, and would 
soon be well again. Indeed, in a few days Florimond was running 
about as if nothing had happened, but he never said anything about 
his mother and the stranger, and the lady at last allowed Manga to 
leave her prison. Remorse had taken hold of Florimond’s mother ; 
she grew thinner every day, and one evening, in spite of the most 
tender care, she died. Her last words were, “Oh! my God, forgive 
me!” She was buried in the grave where her little boy had been ; 
and as to the pirate, he never came back, They say that he was 
hanged. 
After his wife’s death Florimond’s father left Africa, and sold 
poor Manga. She was put upon a ship, and this is how she became 
a slave in Louisiana, and related to me the story of the little finger.

THE STATUE OF ST. ANTHONY. 
A shoemaker ina small town had a beautiful daughter. One day 
she saw a young man enter the house next to hers, and she soon fell 
in love with him. She asked her old cook what she could do to be 
loved by the young man. The old woman advised her to pray to 
St. Anthony. She did so, but without effect. 
“Perhaps he is deaf,” said the cook; “let us make a hole in his 
ears.” 
When they were trying to bore a hole in the ears of the wooden 
statue, the servant of the young man whom the girl loved came into 
the shop. He asked the two women what they were doing. They 
said they wanted St. Anthony to hear a prayer. The servant made 
the holes in the ears of the statue and waited at the door outside to 
hear what was the request the young girl was so anxious to ask. As 
soon as he heard that the young girl was asking St. Anthony to 
obtain for her the love of her neighbor, he ran to his master and 
related the story to him. The latter felt so much flattered by the 
love of the beautiful girl that he fell in love with her, in his turn, 
and married her.

THE LITTLE BOYS AND THE GIANTS. 
Once upon a time there were oo little boys who lived in a house 
not far from ariver. Their parents had forbidden them to go near 
the river ; but one day they ran away, and, taking a skiff which was 
in the river, they rowed and rowed. I believe they rowed millions 
of miles. When night came they were very much afraid, and did 
not know where to go. While they were looking at a light far away 
the giants came to catch them. They climbed upon a tree, but the 
giants merely shook the tree and the poor boys fell down. They 
were carried to the house of the giants, where they found many 
other little boys. They were all fed on milk and hominy, that they 
might grow fat, and every day a few of the little boys were cooked 
and eaten by the giants. 
Not far from the house of the giants lived an old woman who was 
awitch. One day the father of the two little boys who had run 
away came to the old woman’s house with his friends, and asked her

if she had seen his boys, She replied that they were in the house 
near by, before the door of which was a pebble not larger than a 
small marble. The men went to the house, but found that the 
pebble had become a rock as big as a mountain. They had much 
trouble in putting aside the rock and opening the door, but at last 
they entered the house, killed the giants, and brought back their 
little boys.

THE MEN WHO BECAME BIRDS. 
Once upon a time there was a lady who had twelve children, — 
eleven boys and one girl. The poor lady died, and her husband mar- 
ried again. His seeond wife was a witch, who was very bad. In the 
daytime she changed the eleven boys into birds, and allowed them 
to take their human form only at night. As to the girl, she changed 
her into a negress. Her father did not know her any more, and put 
her out of his house. The witch treated her husband’s children in 
that way because she wanted him to leave his money to her own 
children. 
When the poor girl was put out of her father’s house, she went to 
see her brothers and told them what had happened’ to her. They 
said that the next morning they would take her to another country. 
They made a bed with leaves; and the next day, when they .were 
birds again, each one took hold of the bed in his beak, and they car- 
ried their sister far away into another country. They placed her in 
a forest, and built a pretty little hut for her. One day an old witch 
passed by the hut, and when she saw the young girl she asked her 
what she was doing there. The poor girl related her story, and the 
witch told her she would tell her how to make her brothers remain 
men all the time. She must makea shirt for each one of her brothers, 
and not sew the shirts but weave them, and stay without speaking 
until the shirts were ready. It took her a long time to do the work; 
and when she was nearly through, — only one sleeve was missing 
to one shirt, — her stepmother found out where she was and had her 
arrested as a witch. They were taking her in a cart to prison when 
her eleven brothers came flying around the cart. She immediately 
threw the shirts over them, and they became men again and rescued 
their sister. As one of the shirts had only one sleeve, the brother 
who had received that shirt had all his life, instead of an arm, a 
-bird’s wing.

THE GOOD LITTLE SERVANT. 
There was once a gentleman who was very rich and very good. 
His wife always pretended to be sick and needed all kinds of extraor- 
dinary remedies, which her husband had to go and get for her. The 
woman did that to get her husband out of the way and to be abie to 
squander his money. One day she said she must have some sea 
water or she would die. The gentleman had a little servant called 
Little Margot, who always went with him on his journeys. When 
the gentleman went to get the sea water, Little Margot was left 
behind and saw what the mistress was doing with her husband’s 
money. She was preparing to give a great ball and a great supper. 
Little Margot went to tell his master what he had seen, and asked 
him to let him act. They came back secretly to the house, and Little 
Margot told all the servants to follow him and do whatever he would 
order them. He put his master in a large basket and hid in the 
basket a number of whips. During the ball Little Margot came in 
the dancing-hall with two men carrying the basket, and followed by 
the other servants. The mistress and her guests thought it was 
some fine present and crowded around the basket. All at once Little 
Margot said : “ Here is my master come back ;” and taking the whips 
from the basket, he gave them to the servants and to his master, who 
whipped the guests and the lady unmercifully. The gentleman put 
his wife out of his house, and said to her: “ You do not need any 
sea water now to cure you.”

THE BASKET OF FLOWERS.

who were very wicked, and those people had a magpie. One day 
the magpie stole a ring which was on the window; and now when 
the ring was missed Marie was accused of the theft, and she was 
taken and sent to prison. While she was in prison she was treated 
very badly, and they beat her to make her say it was she who had 
stolen the ring.

prison to see her. On the last day before she was to be tried, they 
said she would be sent to the penitentiary. She prayed so much to 
the Holy Virgin that on the very day when judgment was passed 
upon her, they sawed a tree in the yard of the lady, and in the hol- 
low of the tree they found the ring. 
When the lady found the ring she went to the prison and said that 
she had found it. I forgot to tell you that when Marie prayed so 
much to the Holy Virgin she made a vow that if she would be freed, 
she would go to the woods and get the most beautiful flowers she 
could find. Now, when the lady heard of Marie’s vow, she filled a 
basket with the finest flowers she could find in her garden, and she 
gave her a little house for herself and her grandfather.

JOHN GREEN PEAS. 
An old negro, called John Green Peas, lived in a cabin by the king’s 
palace. As all the chickens of the king were being stolen he wanted 
to save his geese, and he asked John to tell him where to put them. 
John was delighted, and the geese disappeared in the same way as 
the chickens. The king asked John to tell him where to put his 
money, and John told him to put his gold where he had put the geese. 
The gold disappeared also. The neighbors then convinced the king 
that John was the robber, and the king went with his guards to arrest 
the old man. John knew what was going on, and he placed on his 
table a goose with gold coin under its wings. When the king arrived 
John showed him the goose, and told him that whenever he needed 
money the goose would give him some, if he played on the fiddle. 
The king bought the goose ; but when he saw how John had deceived 
him, he had him put into a bag to be thrown into the river. The 
men who were carrying the bag got drunk and left John for some 
time in the road. He heard a shepherd coming with his flock, and 
he began crying that he would not marry the king’s daughter. The 
shepherd took John’s place in the bag, in order to marry the king’s 
daughter, and the old man went away with the sheep. The king 
met John, and the latter told him that he had found the sheep and 
the gold at the bottom of the river. 
The king threw himself into the river and was drowned. Poor 
simple king, to leave a palace to jump into the river.

‘“XXVIL 
A POOR LITTLE BOY. 
There was once a woman who used to say that she was poor and 
had nothing to eat. Every day her husband went to work, and often 
with an empty stomach. One day a little boy knocked at the woman’s 
door and asked her if he could come in to warm himself, and if she 
would give him something to eat and a place to sleep. But the 
woman refused, and she said she had no fire, nothing to eat, and no 
place for him to sleep, 
The little boy was very sorry, but he lay down on the ground in 
front of the cabin, and he saw through a crevice in the door all that 
was being done in the cabin. He saw the woman light a big fire, 
make biscuits, cook a pig, and he saw a man, who was hidden in the 
room, come out and warm himself by the fire. 
“Ah! ah!” said the little boy ; “that is why she did not let me 
come into the house. When her husband is not there she has a high 
time. She is letting me die of hunger and cold outside, but she 
will pay for that.” 
A little while later the woman heard some one walking; and as 
she thought it was her husband, she hid the pig in the cupboard, the 
biscuits under a sieve, and the man-under the bed. When the hus- 
- band arrived he saw the little boy lying on the ground freezing, and 
he said to him: ‘What are you doing there? Why are you not at 
home? Did you not ask my wife to let you come in? We are poor, 
but we would always find a little corner for you.” 
“T am not at home, because I have no father and no home. Iam 
not-at your house, because your wife told me there was no room for 
me.” 
“Come with me; my wife will change her mind.” 
He took the little boy, and made him come in; his wife was 
astonished to see her husband with the little boy, and she was afraid 
that he had seen what had happened in the house and had told her 
husband, But the husband appeared very quiet, and he told her that 
he was glad to see that she had found some pieces of wood to make 
a fire, because it was very cold, and he asked her if she had any 
supper for him. She said no; then her husband drew out a loaf of 
bread from his sack and said he had not had much work, and that 
was all he was able to bring. He divided the bread into three 
shares, — for him, his wife, and the little boy. 
Each one ate his bread, and when they were through, the husband 
said: “Let us relate stories as a pastime before we go to bed.”

« All right,” said the woman, because she knew that stories made 
her husband go to sleep, and she would be able to make the man 
escape who was hidden under the bed. 
“Well,” said the husband, “commence first, little boy, because 
you are the youngest.” 
“TI do not know any stories,” said the little boy. ‘My father 
always told me to tell the truth. Ido not know any stories, but I 
know some true things.” 
“Tell us true things, then,” said the husband. 
“Well,” said the little boy, “I know there are biscuits under the 
sieve, pig’s meat in the cupboard, and a man under the bed.” 
“That is not true,” said the woman, who was trembling with 
fright. “There is nothing at all.” 
“Let us look, nevertheless,” said the husband; and he found the 
biscuits, the pig, and the man. 
The ‘husband was so angry to see that his wife had deceived him 
that he put her out with the man, who did not want her, because, if 
she deceived one man, she might deceive another. She died of cold 
in the wood. The husband took the little boy to stay with him ; and 
he thought he was a sorcerer, because the boy did not tell him how 
he found out what he had said.

NOTES. 
  
PART I. ANIMAL TALES, 
Il. The Elephant and the Whaie.— This tale is evidently of African origin; 
in “Fables Sénégalaises, recueillies de louolof et mises en vers frangais, par le 
baron Roger, Firmin Didot, 1828” (lent me by Professor Gerber), we see in Fable 
IL, “Le Chacal, ’Eléphant et ’Hippopotame,” nearly the same plot as in the 
Louisiana tale: the jackal borrows an ox from the elephant, and promises one as 
large as the elephant in return. He does likewise with the hippopotamus. He 
gives the end of a rope to each one, and says: “ Your ox is at the end, pull.” 
They pull, and not being able to move one another, go and see what it is, and 
meet. 
In Baron Roger’s Fable III., “ Le lapin qui se revét de la peau d’une gazelle,” 
the same stratagem is used by the rabbit as at the end of the “ Elephant and the 
Whale.” In Ouolof Bouki means the hyena, and is always a dupe, as the Compair 
Bouki of our Louisiana tale. 
Informant, Dorlis Aguillard, colored man, 157 Thalia Street, New Orleans. 
Il. Compair Taureau and ¥ean Malin. — The motives in this story are to be 
found in many folk-lore tales, but our Louisiana tale is, nevertheless, interesting, 
and is full of Zocal color; for instance, when the boy states that “ he was born when 
the peach-trees were in bloom, the year the snow fell ;” snow is so seldom seen in 
Louisiana that the date of a snowstorm is as easy to remember as the day of the 
battle of New Orleans, “1a guerre Jackson,” say the old negroes. 
Jean Malin and Jean Sotte are as famous in folk-lore tales as Compair Lapin 
and Compair Bouki. 
Informant, Dorlis Aguillard, 157 Thalia Street, New Orleans. 
Ill. Compair Lapin and the Earthworm.—The beginning of this story is 
graceful and poetic, and proves that negroes observe and love nature. The poor 
little earthworm, helpless, while all other animals are joyous and moving about, 
appeals to the Devil, and tacitly sells himself to him. The elephant, carrying the 
trunk of the tree, and the rabbit, sitting on a branch among the leaves, and pre- 
tending to work, is a common incident in folk-lore. 
Informant, Dorlis Aguillard, 157 Thalia Street, New Orleans. 
IV. Compair Lapin and Compair l’Ours.— This is a variant of the well- 
known story of the keg of butter (see No. XIII., “Compair Lapin’s Godchild ”). 
The incident of the boat stage and the way Rabbit escapes are curious and origi- 
nal. I have not seen them in any other folk-tale. 
Informant, Julia, little negress, 7 Prytania Street, New Orleans. 
V. The frishman and the Frogs. — This story is much better in the original 
dialect than in English, and is based ona play of words. “Brum” for “rum,” 
and “jou” for French “genou,” knee. 
Informant, Julia, 7 Prytania Street, New Orleans.

everything which appears strange to us in nature; and primitive people, especially,

are very ingenious in discovering what they consider to be the cause of an anomaly 
in animals and plants. They explain: just as well how the tortoise lost his tail as 
how Madame Carencro became bald. © 
Informant, Julia, 7 Prytania Street, New Orleans. 
VII. Compair Lapin and Mr. Turkey.—In this story Compair Lapin is not 
as cunning as usual, and we can hardly believe that he acted as foolishly as Com- 
pair Bouki would have done. The tale is genuine negro folk-lore, as is evidenced 
by the exact knowledge of the habit of turkeys sleeping on their perches. 
Informant, Julia, 7 Prytania Street, New Orleans. 
VIII. Compair Bouki and the Monkeys. — The monkey, in our Louisiana 
stories, is often a dupe. He is, however, more cunning than Bouki, whose strata- 
gems always fail in the end. Here we have words supposed to indicate the lan- 
guage of the monkeys and of Bouki, and it is interesting to see a negro imitate 
an animal in his stories. 
Informant, an old negro at la Vacherie, St. James Parish. 
IX. Mr. Monkey, the Bridegroom. — Mr. Monkey here shares the fate of poor 
Bouki, who is so often deceived by his friend, Compair Lapin. Mr. Monkey is 
not happier in his love affairs than Mr. Bull in No. II. 
Informant, Méranthe, colored nurse, Hospital Street, New Orleans. 
X. The Tortoise. — This is an amusing story, and it shows that the tortoise 
deserves to share with the fox and the rabbit the reputation of being the most 
cunning animals. Here the tortoise deceives the boy with as much ease as it 
deceived the deer in the celebrated race for the hand of Mamzelle Calinda. 
Informant, Julia, 7 Prytania Street, New Orleans. 
XI. Compair Bouki, Compair Lapin, and the Birds’ Eggs.—- The way Bouki 
finds out what Lapin is cooking in his kettle, and the scraping off the pieces from 
his teeth by his mother, are typical of the negro mind, rude, but at the same time 
droll and cunning. When the birds ask Bouki if he has eaten their eggs, he is 
proud of what he has done, and acknowledges it with blind conceit and foolish 
boldness. 
Informant, Julia, 7 Prytania Street, New Orleans. 
XII. The Dog and the Tiger.— ere we have an explanation of why dogs 
are not afraid of wild beasts, and the story belongs to the class of No. VI., “Com- 
pair Lapin and Madame Carencro.” The killing of the deer and the reply to the 
lion prove that it is not only at present that the “reason of the strongest is 
always the. best.” 
Informant, old negro at la Vacherie. 
XIII. Compair Lapin’s Godchild.—In M. Cosquin’s “ Contes populaires de 
Lorraine,” we see No. 54, “ Le Loup et le Renard,” in which the incident of the 
butter is nearly the same as in our Louisiana story. The end, however, of our 
No. XIII. is like that of the “ Tar Baby,” and not like that of the French tale from 
Lorraine. In his notes, M. Cosquin mentions a large number of variants in differ- 
ent countries, which correspond very closely with the Louisiana tale, the names of 
the children being nearly identical. Our No. 1V., “Compair Lapin and Compair 
YOurs,” is.also a variant of our No. XIII. 
Informant, old negro from a Vacherie. 
XIV. Miss Mockingbird, Mr. Mockingbird, and Mr. Owl.—The stratagem 
by which Miss Mockingbird keeps alive the lover whom she prefers is interesting, 
,and we pity the poor deluded owl. To appreciate this story one must hear it 
recited, or rather sung. 
Informant, old negro from /a Vacherie. 
XV. Marriage of Compair Lapin. — This story may be said to be a continua- 
tion of “Ti Bonhomme Godron”’ (“ The Tar Baby”), published by me in my 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
96 Notes. 
“Bits of Louisiana Folk-Lore” (1888), and reproduced in the appendix to this 
book. The number of characters introduced, and the various incidents, render 
the “Marriage of Compair Lapin” the most interesting in my collection. The 
incidem about Jupiter and the dogs, although a little coarse, is amusing and 
quaint, and the stratagem by which King Lion is defeated is ingenious and worthy 
of Compair Lapin’s fertile brain. Master Fox appears in the tale, but he is no 
match for Compair Lapin, whom he finds to be no Isengrimus, the Wolf. 
Informant, Dorlis Aguillard, 157 Thalia Street, New Orleans, 
PART II. ( MARCHEN. 
XVI. King Peacock. — This story is pretty and naive. The daughter submits 
so gently to her fate that we are glad to hear King Peacock ask her in marriage. 
She accepts him on the spot, and her dream is realized. The incident of the red 
seeds is common to a number of tales. 
Informant, old negro from /a Vacherie. 
XVII. The Singing Bones. — This is a variant of a story found everywhere. 
Informant, old negress, 77 Esplanade Avenue. 
XVIII. Fean Sotte. — This story might have been included among the animal 
tales, as Compair Lapin is one of the personages, and gives such good advice to 
Jean Sotte. The riddle is a reminiscence of classic mythology ; and Jean Sotte’s 
reply about bull’s milk, although a little coarse, is very appropriate and reminds us 
of a peculiar custom referred to in “ Aucassin et Nicoléte.”

XIX. The Devil’s Marriage. —Theincident of the obstacles thrown in the way 
of the pursuer are common to many stories. M. Cosquin gives “Le Sifflet En- 
chanté,” “ L’Oiseau Vert,” “La Chatte Blanche,” “ Le Prince et son Cheval,” in 
which are found some of the incidents of the “ Devil’s marriage.” The warning 
of the old woman to take dirty eggs and not clean ones belongs essentially to folk- 
lore, and the women hanging in the closet is a motive of the Blue Beard type. 
Climbing up the pole to catch the pumpkin has a local coior peculiar to Louisiana, 
and the ingratitude to the old horse is another incident often found in folk-tales. 
Informant, old negro at fa Vacherie. 
XX. The Little Finger.— This story gives the tradition of the negroes about 
the way they left Africa, and about life in that country. The little bird, Nita, 
must be their African mocking-bird, and the part it plays in the tale is graceful 
and poetic. The real folk-lore incident is the little finger left unburied and calling 
for help; this is of the type of the singing bones. The whole story shows the 
lively imagination and somewhat poetic fancy of the negroes.

XXI. The Statue of St. Anthony. — This is a pretty and naive tale. We take 
an interest in the faith of the young girl in St. Anthony, and we are glad to see 
that the statue at last granted her prayer.

folk-tales.

XXIII. The Men who became Birds. — This is a variant of one of the tales in 
the “Seven Wise Men.” The /ocal color is the girl changed into a negress.

in a basket and brought into the ballroom is amusing.

XXV. The Basket of Flowers. — The incident in this story common to folk- 
tales is the object stolen by a bird and found in the hollow of a tree.

XXVI. Fohn Green Peas. — The incidents of the goose laying gold coin and 
of the shepherd taking John’s place in the bag are to be found in numberless 
folktales. M. Cosquin has of this type the following stories: “René et son 
Seigneur,” “ Richedeau,” “ Le Roi et ses Fils,” “ L’Homme au Pois.”

  APPENDIX. 
I. The Zar Baby (Piti Bonhomme Godron). 
Bonneror, BonneFor; Lapin, Lapin! 
I am going to relate to you something which is very funny, as 
you are going to see, and which happened a long time ago ! 
When the animals had the earth for themselves and there were 
yet but few people, God ordered them not to eat each other, not to 
destroy each other, but said that they might eat the grass with all 
kinds of fruits that there were on the earth. That was better, 
because they were all His creatures and it pained Him when they 
killed each other ; but as quickly as they would eat the grass and 
fruits, He, God, would take pleasure to make them grow again’ to 
please them. But they did not obey the Master! Mr. Lion began 
by eating sheep, the dogs ate rabbits, the serpents ate the little 
birds, the cats ate rats, the owls ate chickens. They began to eat 
each other, they would have destroyed each other, if God had not 
put a stop to all that! He sent a great drought to punish their 
cruelty. It was a thing which was funny, nevertheless, as you are 
going to see. 
There was smoke in the air, as when they burn cotton stalks; 
it looked as if there was a light mist. After sunset, the heaven 
remained red like fire. The sea, the rivers, the lakes, all began to 
fall, to fall ; all fell at the same time, until there was not a drop of 
water remaining. Neither did the dew fall early in the morning 
to moisten the grass. Ah! I tell you, my friends, all animals found 
themselves in a great trouble. They were roaming about every- 
where ; their tongues were hanging out ; they became thin, thin. — 
There was among them a doctor who was called Mr. Monkey; 
he was half wizard, half voudou. They said he knew a great deal, 
but he was a big talker, and did very little. He said to the other 
animals that it was because they had made so many sins that God 
sent them all these misfortunes to punish them; that if there were 
any among them who wanted to pay, he would pray to make the rain 
fall. He had already succeeded very often when he asked for some-

thing ; God in heaven always listened to As prayer. There was 
also a famous thief there; it was Mr. Fox, who ate all the chick- 
ens there were in the neighborhood. He said to the other animals: 
“Don’t you listen to Dr. Monkey; he is a d—— rascal; he will 
take your money without giving you anything for it. I know him, 
he is a rascal; you will have no rain at all! It is better that we 
should dig a well ourselves. We need not count upon anything else. 
Let us go! hurrah! right off, if you are all like me, for I am very 
thirsty.” Then Dr. Monkey told him: “I think indeed that you 
are hungry, you d pirate; now that you have finished eating 
all the chickens there were here, you are coming to play the brag- 
gart here.” Mr. Fox told him; “ You are a liar; you know very 
well that the owls, the polecats, and the weasels are eating all the 
chickens, and you come and say it is I. You know that if there 
is a thief here, it is you, you d—— prayer merchant.” — All the 
other animals, tigers, lions, wolves, elephants, crocodiles, serpents, 
were running about to look for water. They had all assembled to 
hear the dispute of Dr. Monkey and Mr. Fox. 
I must tell you that if a hog grunts, a dog barks, a wolf howls, a 
cow bellows, each kind of animal has its own language. A tiger or 
an elephant or a lion cannot speak the language of another animal, 
each one speaks his own. language ; but when they are together, they 
all understand each other—the hog which grunts understands the 
dog which barks. It is not like us men; if a German comes to 
speak with a Frenchman or an American, he will not understand, 
any more than if an Englishman were to speak with a Spaniard who 
does not understand English. We men are obliged to learn the 
language of other nations, if we want to converse with them. Ani- 
mals are not at all like that ; they understand each other as if they 
spoke the same language. Well, I must tell you that Mr. Fox pre- 
tended that if there was such a drought, the rain not having fallen 
for a year, so that all the grass was parched up, and the trees had 
lost their leaves, and there were neither flowers nor fruits, it was 
because there were no clouds in the heaven to give water, and not a 
prayer could make the rain fall. ‘‘ All the water has gone into the 
ground ; we must dig a large well in order to have water to drink. 
Listen to me, my friends, and we shall find water.” 
Lion, who was the king, opened his mouth. He roared, the earth 
shook, he spoke so loud! He beat his sides with his tail, and it 
made a noise like a big drum in a circus, All the other animals 
lay flat on the ground. He said: “ By the very thunder, the first 
fellow who will speak to me about prayers, I shall give him some- 
thing which will make him know me. I am a good fellow; when did 
I ever eat another animal? It is a lie, and I say that the little  
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 Appendix. 
lawyer Fox is a fine little fellow. He is right, we must ‘dig a well 
to have water immediately. Come here, Compair Bourriquet 
(Donkey), it is you who have the finest voice here; when you 
speak, it is like a soldier's trumpet. You will go everywhere to 
notify all animals that I, the king, I say that they must come to dig 
up and scratch the earth, that we may have water. And those that 
don’t want to work, you will report them. You will come right off 
that I may compel them to do their share of the work or pay some 
other animal to do it.” 
Bourriquet was so glad he was to act as a newspaper, that he be- 
gan to bray so loud that it was enough to render anybody deaf. — 
“ Depart, depart,” said the king, “or I shall strike you.” Then Bourri- 
quet reared, and thought he was doing something nice, he was so 
proud that the king had confidence in him, and then that gave him 
the opportunity to order the other animals to come, in the name of 
Lion, the king. On starting, he put down his head, then he kicked 
half a dozen times with both feet, and made a noise which was as 
if you were tearing up a piece of cofonnade. That is his way of 
saluting the company, when he is glad. 
Now, all the animals which he met, he told them, that if they did 
not come immediately to dig up and scratch the ground to make a 
well, surely King Lion would eat them up. They were all so much 
afraid, that they all came, except Compair Lapin, who was gnawing 
a little piece of dry grass. — “Don’t listen to what I tell you, re- 
main there, and don’t come right off, you will see what the king 
will do with you.” —“TI don’t care a d—— for you and the king 
together; come both of you, you will see how 1’ll fix you, You 
may go to the devil. Do I drink? Where did I ever use water? 
Surely, that is something new to me. You are a fool, donkey that 
you are, I never drink, a rabbit never drinks. My father and my 
grandfather did not know how to drink, and as I am a real rabbit, I 
don’t use water. Never did a rabbit have little ones without ears, 
you hear, If any one heard you he might believe that I am a bas- 
tard. Go away, you big ears; for if I take my whip, I shall show 
you your road, and make you trot faster than you ever galloped in 
your life. If you knew me as I know you, you would not have 
stopped here, surely.” : 
Bourriquet saw that he could do nothing, so he went away ; but he 
was not as proud as when he started to tell all animals that the king 
ordered them to come to work. As soon as he arrived near the 
king, he said: “ Master, I went on all your errands, I saw all the 
animals in the world, only Compair Lapin does not want to listen to 
reason. He says he does not need water, let those who need it look 
for it. Besides, if you are not satisfied, he will make you trot. You 
   
-P-A-G-E-113
  Appendix. IOI 
have no right to command him, he is free, free as air; he has 
no master, none but God.” — When the king heard that, he told 
Tiger, who was there, to go with the Bear to arrest Compair Lapin 
and bring him here. “Take care you don’t eat him on the way, for 
if you do, I’ll give you such a beating as you never had before. 
You hear? Well, go.” — They started, and travelled a good while 
before they arrived. During this time, all the animals were working 
hard, each one had his share of the work, and they had even left a 
big piece as Compair Lapin’s task and that of the two who had 
gone to arrest him. They looked everywhere: in the prairie, on 
the mountain ; at last they fell on Compair Lapin, who was eating 
the root of a cocklebur which was full of water. You know that 
rabbits know how to dig up the earth and find water below, in the 
roots of plants. 
At the same moment when they arrived near him, Compair Lapin 
was singing a little song which he had made about the king. He 
said in it that the king was a fool, and did not know how to govern, 
for his wife had many husbands, and he was laughing to himself, and 
that perhaps, after they finished to dig that well, the king would 
make all the animals pay taxes to drink the water from the well 
they had dug with their sweat. I am not so foolish, I am not going 
to work for that fellow! Let the others do it, if they are fools, I 
don’t care any more for the king than a dog for Sunday. Tra la la, 
etc, ... The tiger approached without making any noise, and 
then he said: “Good morning, Compair Lapin, I ask your pardon, 
if I disturb you, but I don’t do it on purpose; the king has ordered 
me to arrest you, I must obey him. You know that the weak must 
submit to the strong ; this is why I advise you not to resist, because 
the Bear and I will be obliged to eat you. Take my advice, come 
quietly, perhaps you will come out all right! Your mouth is hon- 
eyed, you will get Mr. Fox to defend you; he is a good little lawyer 
and does not charge dear! Come, let us go.” 
When Compair Lapin saw that he could not do otherwise, he let 
the officers of the king arrest him. They put a rope around his neck, 
and they started. When they were near the dwelling of the king, 
they met Dr. Monkey on the way. He said: “ Compair Lapin, I 
think you are a pupil of Mr. Fox, you will have to pay for it; you 
are gone up, my old fellow. How are you now? Don’t you feel 
something getting cold within you? That will teach you to read the 
newspaper and meddle in politics on Sundays, instead of going 
quietly to mass!” : 
Compair Lapin answered briefly : “I don’t care a d for any- 
thing you say, old Monkey! And then, you know, he who must die, 
must submit to his fate. Just hush up, you rascal! You are trying   
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 Appendix. 
to injure me, but perhaps you will be the loser ; I have not given up 
all hope; perhaps, before long, you will be in trouble. Each one his 
chance, that is all I have to tell you,” — At last they arrived at a 
big tree which had been thrown down by the wind, and where the 
king was seated. The Tiger and the Bear, the two officers who 
were leading Compair Lapin, said to the king: “Here is the fel- 
low!” “Haw! haw!” said the king, “we shall judge him 
immediately.” Mr. Fox came slyly behind Compair Lapin, and 
told him in his ears : “When they will ask you why you spoke badly 
of the king, say that it is not true, that it is Bourriquet who lied to 
do:you harm. And then flatter the king very much, praise him and 
make him some presents, you will come out all right. If you do 
what I tell you, you will find it well for you. Otherwise, if you are 
foolish enough to say all there is in your heart, take care, you will 
come out all wrong. “I assure you that the king will make hash with 
you.” — “You need not be afraid, Mr. Fox, I know what I have 
to do; I thank you for your good advice ; I am a lawyer myself.” 
Compair Lapin had suspected that they would come to arrest him ; 
he had spoken so badly of the king and the government. It is for 
that he had put on his best coat, and a big gold chain around his 
neck. He had said to one of his neighbors with whom he was quite 
intimate, and also with his wife and daughter, and who was called 
Compair Bouki, when the latter asked him where he was going so 
finely dressed : “‘ Yes, Compair Bouki, I shall soon go to see the king ; 
and as it is the coat that makes the man, this is why I dressed so 
well. It always produces a good effect on proud and foolish people.” 
‘When the king was ready to begin the case of Compair Lapin, he 
said to the policemen: “ Bring the prisoner here to be judged.” 
Then Compair Lapin advanced, and said : ‘‘O Lion, my dear Mas- 
ter, you sent for me; here fam. What do you want?” 
The Lion said : “I have to condemn you, because you are always 
slandering me, and besides, you don’t want to work to dig the well, 
which we are making to drink. Everybody is working except you, 
and when I sent Bourriquet to get you, you said to him that I was a 
scoundrel, and that you would whip me! You will know that if your 
back has tasted of the whip, I have never been whipped ; even my 
late mother did not dare to touch me! What do you have to say? 
You rascal with the long ears hanging down. I suppose they are so 
long, because the hounds have chased you so often. Speak right off, 
or I shall mash you, like a too ripe persimmon.” 
Compair Lapin kept quite cool; he knew that all that was a big 
wind that would bring neither rain nor thunder. He rubbed his 
nose with both paws, then he shook his ears, he sneezed, and then 
he sat down and said: “The king is justice on earth —-as God is
-P-A-G-E-115
  
Appendix, 103 
just in his holy Paradise! Great king, you who are more brave 
than all of us together, you will hear the truth. When you sent 
Bourriquet to get me, he who is more of a donkey than all the don- 
keys in the world, when he came to my house, I was sick. I told 
him : ‘ you will tell the king that I am. very sorry that I cannot come 
now, but here is a fine gold chain, which you will present to the king 
for me, and you will tell him that I have forty twelve other animals to 
work in my place. Because that is too necessary a thing to get a well ; 
it is life or death for us, and we cannot do without it. Tell him 
also that there is but a great king like him to have such an idea, and 
enough brains to save us all!’ What do you think he answered me? 
He replied that he did not care about a gold chain, that he did not 
eat that.. If I had given him a basket of corn or some hay, he would 
have eaten it, but as to the chain, perhaps the king would hitch him 
up to the plough with that same chain, and he would be sorry to 
have brought it. When he went away, he said to me: ‘Go on, papa, 
I shall arrive before you, you will know that the ox which is ahead 
always drinks clear water!’ I suppose he meaiit that he would speak 
before I. should have the chance to be heard! As I want the king to 
believe that I am not telling stories, I have a witness who was there, 
who heard all our conversation. If the king will have the kindness 
to listen to his testimony, he will hear the same thing I have just 
told him.” Compair Lapin bowed to the king, and put the gold 
chain around Lion’s neck, and then he sat down on one side smiling, 
he was so sure that his gift would produce a good effect and help 
him to come out all right from his trouble. Now, Lion said to Mr. 
Fox to speak quickly. ‘I know all that business, and if you 
come here to lie, I’ll break your neck. You need not wag your tail 
and make such grimaces, as if you were eating ants. Come on, 
hurry!. I have no time.” ‘“ Dear Master Lion,” said the Fox, “I 
shall tell you how all that happened: Compair Lapin, whom you see 
here, is the best friend you have. The proof of it is that he brought . 
a big chain to make you a present. You will never see a Bourriquet 
do that ; that is sure, because there is not in the world a greater 
clown than those donkeys. Dan Rice took twenty-one years to train 
a donkey! He says that for $100,000 he would not undertake again 
such a job. He would prefer to train fifty twelve thousand Lions, 
because they would eat him up, or he would do something good with 
them. Well, I must tell you, Mr. Lion, you, who are the king of all 
animals, that same Bourriquet, whom you sent to represent you, 
came to lie on you, and as to Compair Lapin, he is as white as snow! 
Although Dr. Monkey has your confidence, it is he who is governing 
secretly and advising all your people, and putting them in rebellion 
against you, the king, to establish another government, where that
-P-A-G-E-116
104 Appendix. 
same Dr. Monkey and Bourriquet will govern in your place, when 
they will succeed in putting you out. That is what they have been 
trying to do for a long time, and that is what Compair Lapin and I 
wanted to tell you.” 
When the king heard that, he said: “ That is all right ; I am glad 
you told meso, You can go with Compair Lapin, I acquit him.” 
But while they were hearing the case, Dr. Monkey and Bourriquet 
thought that it was not healthy for them to remain there, so they 
escaped when they saw that the wrong side was being warmed up; 
they vanished, and no one knew where they had gone, so well were 
they hidden. After that Compair Lapin and Mr. Fox both re- 
mained in the same parish where the king resided. Mr. Fox was 
his deputy or chief clerk, and the other was mate; that is to say, he 
commanded the others and made them work to finish digging the 
well with their paws. At last the well was completed! All the ani- 
mals drank, and they became strong again. The lioness recovered 
her health also, and some time after that she gave birth to twelve 
little cubs as yellow as gold, and all as pretty as could be. The king 
was so glad that he pardoned all that were in the penitentiary, and he 
allowed the exiles to return. When he granted their pardon, he told 
them all to go and drink the water of the well. Then you may im- 
agine that Dr. Monkey with his accomplice Bourriquet came out of 
their hole to mingle with the others. But they began to spy and to 
watch all that was being done or said. One day they met Mr, Fox 
who was speaking of the government affairs in order to increase the 
tax. He and Compair Lapin found that there was not enough money 
in the treasury for them to beconie rich quickly. When Dr. Monkey 
saw them both together, he began to smile. He came near them, 
he bowed and said: “ Let us forget what has passed, we must not be 
looking for those old papers. Let us be friends and live quietly like 
good neighbors.” You might have thought they were the best 
friends when they parted. Dr. Monkey said to his partner Bourri- 
quet : “You see these two fellows Compair Lapin and Mr. Fox, 
they are d—— scoundrels. I must get the best of them, or they will 
beat me ; that is all I know!” As Compair Lapin had said, when 
they judged him, that he never drank water, the king had told him: 
“Take care that you never try to drink water from this well; I want 
to see if you say the truth, and I order every one to watch you.” 
You will not believe me when I tell you that it is true that rabbits 
never drink water, there is always enough water for them in the 
grass which they eat. But expressly because they had forbidden 
Compair Lapin to drink from that well, he wished to do it. All the 
other animals praised that water so highly : it was so clear, so good. 
That gave him such a thirst, that he felt at every moment as if he
-P-A-G-E-117
Appendix. 195 
had eaten well-peppered salt meat. He said to himself: “I don’t 
care a d—— I shall drink, and I shall see who is going to prevent me. 
Besides, if they catch me, I shall always, have the daughter of the 
king to protect me. She will find some way of preventing them from 
troubling me, for she has much influence with her father.” He did 
as he said; every evening he drank his fill, But at last he wanted 
to drink in the daytime also. It was a strange well ; its water was 
not like any other water ; it made people drunk like whiskey, only, 
instead of making you sick after you were drunk, it made you much 
stronger than before, and they were beginning to perceive that all 
those who were.old were growing young again. Even the vegetables 
which you watered with it, if you cut them, the next day they would 
grow as fine as the day before. 
When Compair Lapin began to see the effect of that water, he 
said: “I must have some for the day also, it does me a great deal of 
good; and as I am much older than the daughter of the king, I must 
become as young as she. Let me be, I shall arrange it. Don’t you 
say anything.’ Well, when it was dark, he took his little calabash, 
which contained about two bottles of water, he went to the well, and 
filled it up. But he was so careful that the guard, which they put 
every evening near the well, saw nothing. 
Dr. Monkey and Bourriquet watched all the time, because they 
could not forget how Compair Lapin nad treated them whilst he was 
being judged. Therefore, they had sworn that they would catch 
him. But in spite of all their efforts, they lost their trouble and 
their time. At last, one day, Dr. Monkey went to see Bourriquet, 
his comrade, and told him: “Come to my house, I have something 
to show to you.” He showed him Ti Bonhomme Godron (a man 
made of tar), and said: “It is with that I want to catch the fellow; 
as this time I shall be able to prove that he is guilty, we shall have 
all his money, which the king will confiscate to give us for discover- 
ing all his rascalities.” 
They took Ti Bonhomme Godron ; they put him in a little path, 
where Compair Lapin was obliged to pass, very near the water, and 
then they started; they knew it was not necessary to watch; Ti 
Bonhomme Godron would attend to him without needing anybody’s 
help. I know not if Compair Lapin suspected something, but he 
came quite late that evening. He never came at the same hour, 
but he managed things so well that he always got his water, and no 
one could catch him. When he arrived the evening they had placed 
Bonhomme Godron there, he saw something black. He looked at it 
for a long time, he had never seen anything like that before! He 
went back immediately, and went to bed. The next evening he came 
again, advanced a little closer, looked for a long time, and shook his
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 Appendix. 
head. At that moment, a frog jumped in the water: ¢choappe. Com- 
pair Lapin flattened on the ground, as if crushed, and in two jumps 
he reached his house. «He remained three days without returning, 
and Dr. Monkey and Bourriquet were beginning to despair, and to. 
believe that it was true that Compair Lapin did not drink at all. 
But it was enough for this one that it was forbidden for him to be 
still more anxious to drink. “Oh! well,” said he; “I don’t care! I 
have some money here, but the remainder is hidden in the briars. If 
they catch me, I shall pay the police, and they will let me go. Be- 
sides, I have the protection of the daughter of the king ; every night, 
she comes to see me. It would be very strange if she did nothing 
for me. Besides, I have always instructed the police to let go a man 
who had money, and I suppose that they will make no exception for 
me, for they would lose the money which I would give them.” 
This reassured him. He started in the evening ; it was a beauti- 
ful moonlight night, and every one was out late promenading. It 
was the end of spring: the honeysuckle perfumed the air, the mock- 
ing-bird was singing in the pecan-tree, there was a light breeze, 
which caused the leaves of the trees to dance, and the rustle pre- 
vented any one to:hear him walk. Everybody was in bed; only the 
dogs, from time to time, were barking at the big clouds, which were 
fleeing before the wind, “It is my turn now; I, Compair Lapin, I 
am going to drink, but a drink that will count.” He took his cala- 
bash. - When he arrived at the place where Bonhomme Godron was, 
the old fellow was still there. It had been warm during the day, 
and the tar was soft. When Compair Lapin arrived there, he said: 
“Hum, hum, you have been long enough in my way. I do-not 
eome to drink ; that is a thing which I never do; I want to take a 
bath to-night ; get away from here.” “You don’t want to answer? 
T tell you that I want to take a bath, you black scoundrel.” Bon- 
homme Godron did not reply; that made Compair Lapin angry. 
He gave him a slap, his hand remained glued: “Let me go, or I 
shall strike you with the other hand.” Bonhomme Godron did not 
reply. He struck him cam with the other hand; it remained stuck 
also!. “I'll kick you, d rascal, if you don’t let me go.” One 
foot remained stuck, and then the other one. : 
Then he said; “ You are holding me that they might injure me, 
you want to try to rob me, but stop, you will see what I am going to 
do to you. Let me go, or I shall strike you with my head and break 
your mouth!” As he said that, he struck, and a mule could not hit 
harder, he was so mad. His head, however, my dear friends, re- 
mained stuck also. He was caught, well caught. At daybreak, Dr. 
Monkey and Bourriquet arrived. When they saw Compair Lapin 
there, they laughed, they cursed him. They took a cart to bring  
-P-A-G-E-119
  
Appendix. 107 
him to prison, and all along the way they told the people how they 
had put a trap to catch the most famous rascal there was in the uni- 
verse. It was the famous Compair Lapin who had so sullied the 
reputation of the king’s daughter, that there was not a great prince 
who wanted to marry Miss Léonine, as Compair Lapin had spoken 
so much about his being her lover. Mr. Fox, who was passing, 
heard all the bad things which Dr. Monkey and Bourriquet were 
saying about Compair Lapin, and he replied: “ Yes, it is true, there 
is nothing like a thief to catch another thief.” 
When they were taking Compair Lapin to prison, all who passed 
on the road threw bricks at him, and they made a true clown of him. 
When he arrived in the presence of the king, the latter said to him: 
“Now, I would like to hear what you can say to get out of this 
scrape.” Compair Lapin replied: “When the tree falls, the goat 
climbs on it! I know I can die but once, I don’t care. If it is my 
money they want, I assure you that they will never see it. When I 
was free, never Bourriquet and Dr. Monkey tried to quarrel with 
me; the wild hog knows on what tree he must rub himself. I assure 
you that they are famous rascals.” — “ You must not speak in that 
way before the king, but the king will try your case in a few min- 
utes,” — “ What I say is well said; I am ready to hear the judgment.” 
— After the king and his friends had consulted together, they found 
Compair Lapin guilty and they condemned him to death. They 
ordered that he be put in prison until they could find an executioner 
willing to execute him. The king thought that he would get rid of 
a fellow who was too cunning for him, and then he would take ven- 
geance on Compair Lapin, because he had injured Miss Léonine’s 
character in such a manner that it was a scandal. 
While Compair Lapin was in prison, he was thinking how he 
would manage to escape forever. He thought that he was in a 
worse plight than he had ever been before. He said to himself: 
“ By Jove! that is no child’s play ; I think that Iam goneup. Well, 
as I am tired, let me sleep a little: it will do me good.” ‘He lay 
down on the floor, and, soon after, he was snoring. He began to 
dream that the beautiful Léonine, the daughter of the king, was 
making a sign to him to tell him he need not be afraid, that she 
would fix everything all right. He awoke contented, and at daybreak 
the jailer opened the door of his prison and said to him : “ They have 
found an executioner willing to execute you, but before that, they 
must cut off your ears ; it is Bourriquet who has offered his services 
to send you in the other world. Take courage, my old fellow, I 
am sorry for you, you are a good fellow, but you risked your life too 
often. You know that an ounce of prevention is better than a pound 
of cure; now it is too. late. Good-bye, comrade.” At the same
-P-A-G-E-120

moment the sheriff came with his deputies to take him to the place 
of execution. — They arrived at the steep bank of a little river. 
There were tall trees, grass, and briars everywhere. They chose a 
clear space. When they arrived, there was a big crowd : gentlemen, 
ladies, many children. ‘All had come to see how they were going to 
kill Compair Lapin. The king was there with all his family. Miss 
Léonine, the daughter of the king, was there also. Oh! but she 
was so beautiful with her curls, which shone like gold in the sun. 
She hada muslin dress as white as snow with a blue sash, and a 
crown of roses on her head. The eyes of all were turned towards 
her ; she was so pretty that they forgot completely Compair Lapin, 
who was trembling like a leaf. Yes, indeed, he was sorry to leave 
such a large fortune and such a beautiful wife as the king’s daughter. 
What pained him the most was to think that perhaps Dr. Monkey 
or Bourriquet would marry Miss Léonine as soon as he would be 
dead, because they both boasted that Compair Lapin was in their 
way. Without him, they said they would have succeeded long ago. 
Now the king said: “ Well, let us put an end to all this ; advance, 
Bourriquet, and read Compair Lapin his sentence.” The king allowed 
him to choose his death, as he pleased : to be drowned in the river, 
burnt alive, or hung on a tree, or to have his neck cut with a sword. 
“Yes, yes,” said Compair Lapin, “all that at once, or one after the 
other, if that pleases you so much that I should die, well, I am very 
glad. Only, I was afraid that you would throw me in those great 
thorns, that would tear my skin and I would suffer too much, and 
then, the snakes and the wasps would sting me. Oh! no, not that, 
not that atall!” Tell the king to do all except throwing me in those 
briars ; for the love of God, who is in Heaven, and who will judge 
you as you judge me!” “Haw! haw! you are afraid of the thorns? 
We want to see you suffer, suffer, you scoundrel.” — They were 
making such a noise that the king said: “ What is the matter?” He 
came closer, accompanied by his daughter, Miss Léonine, who had 
come to see if Compair Lapin was going to die bravely ; that is to 
say, every one thought so, but she had come to encourage him and 
reassure him, because she hac sent word to him secretly, while he 
was in prison, that even if the rope was around his neck, she, 
Miss Léonine, would arrive in time to take it off and save him, 
because she loved him more than anything in the world. 
They related to the king and to Miss Léonine what Compair 
Lapin had said, and how much afraid he was to be thrown in the 
thorns and to sufier. Miss Léonine came forward and said: “ Papa, 
I have a favor to ask you: I know that you hate Compair Lapin, 
and I also, because he has sullied my name. Well, I want to make 
you all see that what they said is not true. I want to see him
-P-A-G-E-121
  
Appendix. 109 
suffer for all his stories ; we must get rid of him, and I ask you to 
throw him in the briars and let him rot there; it is good enough 
for such a rascal.” All clapped their hands, they were so. glad. 
“Throw him in the briars; it is there indeed we must throw him,” 
said the king; “he must suffer. Quick! Hurry!” — They took 
Compair Lapin by each limb, they swung him once; poor devil, he 
was crying: ‘No, no, not in the briars, in fire, cut my neck, not 
in the briars.’ They said: “Twice” —Vap/ they threw him ina 
great bunch of thorns. 
As Compair Lapin fell in his native country, he sat down, he 
rubbed his nose, shook his ears, and then he said: ‘Thank you, all 
ef you ; I thought you were stupid, but it is here my mother made 
me; I am at home here, and not one of you can come here to catch 
me. Good-by, I know where I am going.” Miss Léonine also was 
very glad ; she knew where she would meet Compair Lapin that very 
evening. That proves one thing to you, that Compair Lapin was a 
hypocrite and pleaded false things to know the truth. It proves 
another thing, that when a woman loves a man, she will do all he 
wishes, and the woman will do all in her power to save him, and in 
whatever place the man may be, the woman will go to meet him. 
This is why they say that what a woman wants, God wants also. 
As, I was there when all that happened, they sent me here to 
relate it to you. I have finished. 
Il. Compair Bouki and Compair Lapin, —No. i. 
One day, Compair Bouqui met Compair Lapin. ‘“ How,” said he, 
“is that you? Don’t you know that it is to-day that all persons are 
selling their mothers to have something to eat ?’’—- “ Ah! yes,” said 
Compair Lapin, “I, also, am going to get my mother, and I shall 
sell her for a kettle of hominy and one of gombo.” Now both of 
them started. Compair Bouqui tied his mother with a rope, and 
during that time Compair Lapin tied his with a cobweb. Before he 
entered the cart, he said: “ Now, mamma, as soon as you will arrive 
near the briars you will jump down and run to the house.” Com- 
pair Bouqui sold his mother, and returned in his cart with his kettle 
of hominy and his kettle of gombo. While he was on his way 
home, he saw a rabbit lying in the road, and a little further, another 
rabbit. He advanced a little more, and there was another rabbit. 
When he came to the third rabbit, he said: “It is not possible, 
those rabbits are dying of hunger instead of selling their mothers 
to get something to eat ; let me get down to catch them.” He was 
not able to catch anything, because it was Compair Lapin who 
pretended to be dead, to make Compair Bouqui leave his cart. 
During that time, Compair Lapin ran to the cart of Compair Bou-

qui, stole his two kettles, cut the tail of his horse, planted it in the 
ground, and, taking the cart away, went to hide himself. Compair 
Bouqui came back to look for his cart, but he only saw the tail of 
his horse planted in the ground. He began to dig in the ground, as 
he thought that his horse and his cart had fallen in a hole, and he 
called for help. Tiger came out of the woods, and helped Compair 
Bouqui to dig. Compair Bouqui found Tiger so fat that he bit him 
on his back, and escaped. Tiger asked Compair Lapin what he 
could do to take vengeance on Compair Bouqui. Compair Lapin 
said : “ We must give a grand ball, come this evening to my house.” 
Tiger and Compair Lapin engaged good musicians and invited many 
persons. Compair Lapin came out on the gallery, and began to 
ing : 
. oe “ Come to the grand ball, 
Those that lost their wives, 
Beautiful negresses from Senegal.” 
Compair Bouqui, who heard that, ran to Compair Lapin and cried 
out: “It is my wife, it is not necessary to invite any more people,” 
But Compair Lapin pretended not to hear, and he beat his drum, 
and sang: “ Simion, carillon painpain, Simion, carillon painpain.” 
Compair Bouqui entered Compair Lapin’s cabin, and he took Tiger 
for a woman, because he had hidden his beard and dressed like a 
young lady. When the ball was over, Compair Bouqui remained 
alone with Tiger, who gave him a good beating and ran off with 
Compair Lapin. Now that is not all: Tiger and Compair Lapin 
did not know where Compair Bouqui was. When Compair Lapin 
came near his cabin, he cried out: “Good night, my cabin, good 
night,” and he said: “That is strange, my cabin, which always re- 
plies, says nothing to-day.” Compair Bouqui, who was not at all 
cunning, answered : Good night, my master, good night.” “Ah! we 
have him,” said Compair Lapin, “ get some fire, we are going to give 
some smoke to Compair Bouqui, in this cabin.” They burned poor 
Compair Bouqui, and Compair Lapin was so glad that he jumped 
like a kid and sang: 
“ Aie, aie, ate, Compair Lapin, 
He is a little animal that knows how to jump.” 
  III. Choal Djé (The Horse of God). 
Choal Djé had a pond, and he allowed all the comrades to drink 
from it, except Compair Lapin and his comrades. One day he 
caught Compair Lapin near his pond. “If I catch you drinking 
‘from my pond, I shall make you pay a fine.” Compair Lapin re- 
plied: “ Well-ordained charity begins with one’s self, and as you 
are the master I am not going to drink from your pond.” But one

day they killed a deer, and after having skinned it, they threw away 
the skin. Compair Lapin picked up the skin and passed his head 
in it; he then went to drink in Choal Djé’s pond. When Choal Djé 
saw that, he advanced nearer and asked Compair Chévreil who it 
was that had marked him in that way. Compair Chévreil 
answered: “It is Compair Lapin who made the sign of the cross 
on. me, and who put me in this condition, and if you don’t let him 
drink: in your pond, he will do the same thing with you.” — “ Well, 
you may tell Compair Lapin that he can come to drink in my pond 
with all his comrades. I don’t want him to do the same thing with 
me,” — Compair Lapin ran to his house, took off the skin, and came 
back with his comrades to drink in Choal Djé’s pond. When Choal 
Djé saw him coming, he said to him: “ Drink as much as you want, 
Compair Lapin, with your comrades.” — Compair Lapin was always 
more cunning than everybody else. 
IV. Compair Bouki and Compair Lapin. — No. 2. 
One day, Compair Bouqui went to see Compair Lapin. When he 
entered the cabin, he saw a big pot, which was on the fire, and it 
smelt so good that Compair Bouqui could not stay:quiet. When the 
food was cooked, Compair Bouqui had also his share and he found 
it so good that he kept on bothering Compair Lapin to know where 
hetook such good meat, —“ Pray, Compair Lapin, tell me where you 
find that meat.” — “No, Compair Bouqui, you are too greedy.” —~ 
“ Compair Lapin, my poor children are dying of hunger, tell me where 
you find that meat.” — “No, Compair Bouqui, you are too rascally.” 
At last, he bothered Compair Lapin so much, so much, that Com- 
pair Lapin said: “ Listen, Compair Bouqui, I am going to tell you, 
but you must not tell any one, and you must do as I tell you. You 
know the king’s ox, which is in the pasture, and which is so fat, 
well, you will take a bag and a knife, you will watch when he will 
open his mouth to eat, you will jump in his throat, and when you 
will arrive in his belly, you will begin to cut the meat to put in 
your bag. Now, be very careful not to cut near his heart, because 
you would kill him. When he will open his mouth again to eat, you 
will jump out and run home. Don't you let any one see you.” The 
next morning, Compair Bouqui took his bag and his knife and ran 
into the pasture. When the king’s ox opened his mouth to eat, he 
jumped into his belly, and he began to cut the meat and to put it 
into his bag. The more he cut, the closer he came to the heart -of 
the ox. He saw that the meat was so fine and fat, that he said to 
himself: ‘What will it matter, if I cut a little piece, that will not 
kill him.” He took his knife, he cut a piece, lo! the ox of the king 
fell down dead, and Compair Bouqui could not come out of his belly.
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 Appendix, 
All the people came to see what had happened, how the ox that 
was so fine had died like that. They said: “We must open him to 
see what was the matter with him.” When they did that, what did 
they see? Compair Bouqui. “Ah! Compair Bouqui, it is you who 
killed the ox of the king, you wanted to steal meat, just wait, we are 
going to fix you.” — They took Compair. Bouqui, they opened his 
belly, they took out his bowels, they filled him with sand, and they 
closed the opening with a cork. When Compair Bouqui returned 
home he was very much ashamed. His children ran to see the good 
meat which he had brought. — “ Papa, give us some meat.” — “ There 
is none, my children.” —“ Yes, papa, something smells good on you.” 
The little ones advanced, and Compair Bouqui backed, backed. 
The children commenced to smell the cork; they found it smelt 
good, because there was honey on it. They began to suck the cork, 
to suck the cork. Lo! the cork came out; all the sand ran out, 
Compair Bouqui died on the spot. He was flat on the ground. 
V. Compair Bouki and Compair Lapin. —No. 3. 
One day the children of Compair Bouki met those of Compair 
Lapin, who had on fine Sunday.dresses and new shoes. When the 
little Boukis returned home, they asked their father why he did not 
give them fine clothes like those of Compair Lapin’s children. Com- 
pair Bouki went to see Compair Lapin, and asked him where he took 
the fine things he had given tohis children. Compair Lapin did not 
want to reply, but Compair Bouki annoyed him so much that he said 
to him: “Go and cut wood in the forest ; and when you will be tired, 
look in the centre of the forest, and you will see a big tree. Go to 
sleep under it, and when you will awake, say: ‘Tree, how sweet you 
are!’ The tree will say: ‘If I were to open, what would you say ?” 
You will reply : ‘If you open, I shall be very glad.’ When the tree 
will open, enter into it; it will close up, and you will see many pretty 
things. Take what you want, and tell the tree: ‘Open!’ when you 
wiil wish to depart.” Compair Bouki did what Compair Lapin had 
said, but when he saw all there was in the tree, he wanted to take so 
many things that he forgot to say: “ Trée, open!” 
The tree belonged to some thieves, who hid their booty in it. 
They came back in the woods, and they found Compair Bouki, who 
was stealing their goods. I need not tell you that they gave Com- 
pair Bouki such a beating that he could not move. 
VI. Compair Bouki and Compair Lapin. —No. 4. 
Compair Bouki and Compair Lapin went together to pay a visit to. 
some young ladies. While they were speaking, Compair Lapin said 
to the young ladies: “ You see Compair Bouki; he is not a person, 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  Appendix. <7 aR 
he is a horse which my father has left me.” The young ladies said : 
“Oh! no, we cannot believe that.’”” Now Compair Lapin returned 
home; and when came the day appointed for the visit to the young 
ladies, he dressed up fine, and covered his clothes with a hog’s skin. 
When Compair Bouki came in, he said: “Are you ready, Com- 
pair?” Compair Lapin replied: “But no, don’t you see how I am 
covered up? I feel cold, and I am suffering so much from my feet 
that I don’t know how I am going to do to walk.” Compair Bouki, 
who was always so stupid, said: “Mount on my back, and when you 
will be near the house of the young ladies, you will get down.” 
Compair Lapin said: “I don’t know if I shall be able to mount on 
your back, but I shall try.” Without Compair Bouki’s seeing it, 
Compair Lapin put on his spurs and mounted on Bouki’s. back. 
While he was on Compair Bouki’s back, Compair Lapin was all the 
time moving. His friend asked him what was the matter. “I am 
suffering so much that I know not how to sit.” Compair Lapin 
said that, but he was trying to shake off his hog’s skin. 
When they arrived near the house of the young ladies, Compair 
Lapin stuck Compair Bouki, with his spurs, and Compair Bouki 
started running. Compair Lapin jumped down, and went into the 
house of the young ladies, to whom he said: ‘“‘ You see that I was 
right when I told you that Compair Bouki was a horse which my 
father had left me.” 
VII. Compair Bouki and Compair Lapin—WNo. 5. 
One day, quite early, Compair Lapin arose, and he felt hunger 
gaining upon him. He looked everywhere in the cabin; he found 
nothing to eat. He ran towards Compair Bouki. When he arrived, 
he saw Compair Bouki, who was gnawing a bone. — Eh! Compair 
Bouki, I had come to take breakfast with you; but I see that you 
don’t have anything famous to give me. — Times are hard, Compair 
Lapin; there are no more rations in the cabin; only this bone left. 
Compair Lapin reflected a little. — Well! Compair Bouki, if you 
wish, we shall go hunting for the eggs of the tortoise. — Agreed 
upon ! let us go right off. Compair Bouki took his basket and his 
hoe, and they started towards the bayou in the woods. — Compair 
Lapin, I don’t often go hunting for tortoise eggs } I don’t know well 
how to find them. — Don’t trouble yourself, Compair Bouki, I find 
all the time a place where tortoises lay their eggs. You, you will dig 
them up. 
When they arrived at the bayou, Compair Lapin walked slowly, 
looking well on this side and on that side. Soon he came to a dead 
stop. — Compair Bouki, the tortoise thinks she is cunning. She 
scratches the ground with her big paw, and she lays her eggs in a
-P-A-G-E-126
  114 Appendix. 
hole; then she puts.a little sand on them, and then she scatters 
leaves on her nest. You see this hillock? Take off the leaves, and 
scratch with your hoe; sure you will find eggs. Compair Bouki did 
what Compair Lapin told him, and they saw a pile of eggs shining 
in that hole. —Compair Lapin, you are more cunning than I; I am 
very glad to have you for my friend. Compair Lapin shared the 
eggs; he gave half to Compair Bouki.— Compair Bouki, I am very 
hungry; I am going to eat my eggs immediately. —Do as you 
want, Compair Lapin ; I shall take mine to my wife to have them 
cooked. : 
They went on a long time still, and they found many eggs. Com- 
pair Lapin always ate his; Compair Bouki did not like raw eggs; 
he put them all in his basket. — Compair Bouki, I am beginning to 
be tired ; I believe it is time for us to return home. — I have enough 
eggs for to-day, Compair Lapin ; let us go back. — As they were going, 
towards the river, Compair Lapin said to himself: Compair Bouki 
does not know how to find tortoise eggs; it is I who found them; 
they ought all to belong tome. I must make some trick to gain 
them.— As they were nearly arrived at the river, Compair Lapin 
said: Compair Bouki, I forgot.to take some eggs for my old mother. 
You would be very kind to lend mea dozen. I shall return them to 
you another time.—-Compair Bouki gave a dozen, and they went 
each on his way. Compair Lapin went to put his dozen of eggs in 
his cabin, then he went to Compair Bouki’s. When he came near 
the cabin of Compair Bouki he began to complain, and to hold his 
belly with both hands. Compair Bouki came out.— What is the 
matter with you, Compair Lapin? You don’t look very well. — Oh! 
no, Compair Bouki, those eggs have poisoned me. : 
I beg of you; quick, run to get the doctor. —I shall run as fast 
as I can, daddy. As soon as Compair Bouki started, Compair Lapin 
went to the kitchen and fell to eating tortoise eggs. — Thank you, 
great Lord, I shall eat my belly full to-day. The physician lives far, 
I have the time to eat all before they come. 
When Compair Lapin had nearly finished eating the eggs, he 
heard Compair Bouki speaking outside.— Doctor Monkey, I am 
very glad that I met you on the road; my friend is very sick. — 
Compair Lapin did not lose any time; he opened the window and 
jumped out. Compair Bouki came into the cabin; he did not see 
Compair Lapin. He ran into the kitchen; the shells of the eggs 
were scattered all about. Compair Lapin was already in the fields. 
Compair Bouki tore his hair, he was so angry. He started to run 
after Compair Lapin. Compair Lapin had eaten so many eggs, that 
he was not able to run fast. When he saw Compair Bouki was 
pressing him too close, he hid in a hole in a tree.
-P-A-G-E-127
  Appendix. 115 
Compair Bouki called Compair Torti, who was passing on the 
road.— Compair Torti, pray come to watch Compair Lapin, who 
stole all your eggs. I am going to get my axe to cut down this tree. 
— Go quickly, Compair Bouki; I shall watch the rascal well. When 
Compair Bouki started, Compair Lapin said: Compair Torti, look in 
this hole ; you will see if I have your eggs. Compair Torti lifted 
his head; Compair Lapin sent some decayed wood in his eyes. 
Compair Torti went to wash his eyes in the bayou; Compair Lapin 
ran off immediately. Compair Bouki came to cut the tree; he saw 
that Compair Lapin had already run away. He was so angry he 
went to Compair Torti, on the bank of the bayou, and he cut off his 
tail with his axe.—It is for this reason that the tail of the tortoise is 
so short to this very day. 
VIII. Compair Bouki and Compair Lapin.— No. 6. 
One day, Compair Bouki; who was dying of hunger, went to see 
his old friend, Compair Lapin. He found him thinking of nothing, 
and occupied in cleaning some fish, Bouki asked where he had 
taken that. His old friend related his story to him. He told him: 
“You see, daddy, I went to watch for the fish cart on the foad. I 
saw it coming; I lay down in the road, as if I was dead. The 
master of the cart came down right off to pick me off. He shook 
me up a little; and after that, he threw me in his cart, on a pile of 
fish. I did not move my feet, like Mr. Fox. I watched well the 
old master, until I saw he had forgotten me. I began quietly to 
throw all the fish in the road until we had nearly gone a mile further ; 
then, when I thought I had enough, I jumped down and picked up 
all the fish which I had thrown in the road. There were one hun- 
dred or a thousand —TI did not count; I was in such a hurry. I 
put them all by myself on my back, faster than I could; and I came 
straight here to eat them.” Compair Bouki reflected a long while; - 
he was a little afraid that if he tried to do the same thing, he would 
put himself again in trouble. Compair Lapin, who was looking at 
him with his good eyes, saw that his friend was reflecting too long. 
He told him: “Old friend, you are dying of hunger; do like me; 
go and watch for the cart on the road, steal as much as you can, and 
we shall have a grand festival.” 
Old Bouki, who was greedy, could not resist ; he started, he lay 
down on the road as if he was dead for true, he lifted his feet in 
the air to deceive people better. When the master of the cart came 
very near, he saw old Bouki, who was playing his tricks to catch him. 
He came down with a big plantation whip, and gave him a whipping 
which had red pepper, black pepper, and salt, it burned so much. 
Compair Bouki remained one month in his bed after that. He did

not have a single feather left, and had colics to his very beak. They 
gave him a great deal of tafia to give him strength ; they put him in 
a large bath made with gombo, and they made him drink some laurel 
tea all the time after that. When Compair Bouki was cured, he 
swore, but too late, that Compair Lapin would never deceive him 
again.

IX. Zin Vit Zombi Malin. —The Cunning Old Wizard. 
There was once a prince who was very rich. One day the prin- 
cess, his daughter, lost a big diamond. While she was crying for 
her jewel, an old man came to the palace, and said that he was a 
wizard. The prince promised that he would give him anything he 
would ask, if he would say where was’ the diamond. The wizard 
only asked for three meals, and promised to find the jewel. They 
gave him an excellent breakfast, and when he had eaten all, he said: 
“One is taken.” The servants of the prince began to tremble, be- 
cause it was they who had stolen the diamond. After his dinner, 
the wizard said: “ Two are taken.” The servants trembled still more. 
After supper, the wizard said : “ Three are taken.” When they heard 
that, the three thieves fell on their knees before the wizard, and said 
that they would give back the diamond, if he promised to say nothing 
to their master. 
Now the wizard took the diamond, rolled it up in a piece of bread, 
and threw it before a turkey in the yard. The turkey gobbled up 
the bread with the diamond. The wizard went to get the prince and 
his daughter, and told them that the diamond was in the turkey’s 
stomach, and that they would find it, on killing the turkey. That 
was done, and the diamond was found. The prince was very glad, 
and said that the old man was the greatest wizard in the world. — 
At the court everybody was admiring the wizard, but a few young 
men were not sure that he was a true wizard, and they wanted to 
catch him. They caught a cricket in the grass, they put it in a box, 
and they asked the wizard to tell them what there was in the box. 
The old man did not know, and he said to himself: “‘ Well, Cricket, 
you are caught.” His name was Cricket, but the people there did 
not know that, and they thought that the wizard had guessed that 
there was a cricket in the box. Therefore, the old man passed for a 
great wizard, and they gave him many good things: and yet he was 
merely cunning, and had had luck.

X. Ein Fame ki tournin Macague,— A Woman changed into a Monkey. 
There was once a gentleman who had a field of peanuts. Every 
day he saw that some one was eating a row of peanuts. He asked his 
wife who was eating his peanuts. His wife said it was his brother 
who was eating them every day. He then caught hold of the little 
boy and gave him a good beating. The next day he saw another 
row of peanuts had been eaten. He seized the little boy and gave 
him another beating. The little boy said, “That is too much; my 
brother is always beating me; I must make him see that it is his 
wife who is eating his peanuts.” The next day he did not carry his 
brother’s dinner in the field, but he told him to come to the house, 
and he would show him who was eating his peanuts. When they 
came in, his wife approached to serve the dinner, and now the little 
boy began to sing: “ Tou man, — tou mangé tou, tou man, tou mangé 
tou.”” The woman said: “ Why are you singing that? I don’t want 
you to sing that, sing something else.” — “No, that is what I want 
-to sing.” He continued to sing, and they saw the woman begin to 
scratch, begin to jump, and at last she became a monkey. She ran 
into the peanut field, and she ate a whole row. “You see,” said the 
little boy, “that it is not I who eat your peanuts; it is your wife 
who, every day, becomes a monkey.” The gentleman advanced with 
a stick, but the monkey ran into the woods and climbed upon a tree. 
XI. The Talking Eggs 
There was once a lady who had two daughters ; they were called 
Rose and Blanche. Rose was bad, and Blanche was good; but the 
mother liked Rose better, although she was bad, because she was 
her very picture. She would compel Blanche to do all the work, 
while Rose was seated in her rocking-chair. One day she sent 
Blanche to the well to get some water in a bucket. When Blanche 
arrived at the well, she saw an old woman, who said to her: “ Pray, 
my little one, give me some water; I am very thirsty.” “Yes, 
aunt,” said Blanche, “here is some water ;”’ and Blanche rinsed her 
bucket, and gave her good fresh water to drink. " pei you, my 
child, you are a good girl; God will bless you.” 
A few days after, the mother was so bad to Blanche that she ran 
away into the woods. She cried, and knew not where to go, because 
she was afraid to return home. She saw the same old woman, who 
was walking in front of her. “Ah! my child, why are you crying? 
What hurts you?” ‘Ah, aunt, mamma has beaten me, and Iam 
afraid to return to the cabin.” “Well, my child, come with me; I

will give you supper and a bed; but you must promise me not to 
laugh at anything which you will see.” She took Blanche’s hand, 
and they began to walk in the wood. As they advanced, the bushes 
of thorns opened before them, and closed behind their backs. A 
little further on, Blanche saw two axes, which were fighting ; she 
found that very strange, but she said nothing. They walked further, 
and behold! it was two arms which were fighting ; a little further, 
two legs; at last, she saw two heads which were fighting, and which 
said: “Blanche, good morning, my child ; God will help you.” At 
last they arrived at the cabin of the old woman, who said to Blanche: 
“Make some fire, my child, to cook the supper ;”” and she sat down 
near the fireplace, and took off her head. She placed it on her 
knees, and began to louse herself. Blanche found that very strange ; 
she was afraid, but she said nothing. The old woman put back her 
head in its place and gave Blanche a large bone to put on the fire 
for their supper. Blanche put the bone in the pot. Lo! ina moment 
the pot was full of good meat. 
She gave Blanche.a grain of rice to pound with the pestle, and 
thereupon the mortar became full of rice. After they had taken 
their supper, the old woman said to Blanche: “Pray, my child, 
scratch my back.” Blanche scratched her back, but her hand was 
all cut, because the old woman’s back was covered with broken glass. 
When she saw that Blanche’s hand was bleeding, she only blew on 
it, and the hand was cured. 
When Blanche got up the next morning, the old woman said to 
her: “You must go home now, but as you are a good girl I want to 
make you a present of the talking eggs. Go to the chicken-house ; 
all the eggs which say ‘Take me,’ you must take them; all those 
which will say ‘Do not take me,’ you must not take. When you will 
be on the road, throw the eggs behind your back to break them.” 
As Blanche walked, she broke the eggs. Many pretty things came 
out of those eggs. It was now diamonds, now gold, a beautiful car- 
riage, beautiful dresses. When she arrived at her mother’s, she had 
so many fine things that the house was full of them. Therefore her 
mother was very glad to see her. The next day, she said to Rose: 
“You must go to the woods to look for this same old woman; you 
must have fine dresses like Blanche.” 
Rose went to the woods, and she met the old woman, who told 
her to come to her cabin; but when she saw the axes, the arms, the 
legs, the heads, fighting, and the old woman taking off her head to 
louse herself, she began to laugh and to ridicule everything she saw. 
Therefore the old woman said: “Ah! my child, you are not a good 
girl; God will punish you.” The next day she said to Rose: “I 
don’t want to send you back with nothing; go to the chicken-house, 
and take the eggs which say ‘ Take me.’” 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
Appendix. 119 
Rose went to the chicken-house. All the eggs began to say: 
“Take me,” “Don’t take me;” “Take me,” “Don’t take me.” 
Rose was so bad that she said: “ Ah, yes, you say ‘ Don’t take me,’ 
but you are precisely those I want.” She took all the eggs which 
said “Don’t take me,” and she went away with them. 
As she walked, she broke the eggs, and there came out a quantity 
of snakes, toads, frogs, which began to run after her. There were 
even a quantity of whips, which whipped her. Rose ran and 
shrieked. She arrived at her mother’s so tired that she was not 
able to speak. When her mother saw all the beasts and the whips 
which were chasing her, she was so angry that she sent her away like 
a dog, and told her go to live in the woods. 
XII. Grease. 
There was once a lady who-had four daughters. They were so 
pretty that everybody wanted to marry them. They were called 
La Graisse, Dépomme, Banane, and Pacane. La Graisse was the 
prettiest, but she never went out in the sun, because they were afraid 
that she would melt. La Graisse used to go out every day in a 
beautiful golden carriage. The son of the king saw her every day, 
but La Graisse was so pretty and the carriage shone so much that it 
dazzled his eyes, and he had to rub them in order to be able to see. 
The king’s son was in love with La Graisse. He ran to the mother 
to ask her to let him marry her; but the mother, who knew that La 
Graisse was the prettiest of her daughters, wanted to marry the 
others first. She called Dépomme: “ Dépomme oh! orimomo, ori- 
momo!” Dépomme came, but the gentleman looked at her well, 
and said that it was not the one he wanted; she would spoil too 
quickly. The mother called: “Banane oh! orimomo, orimomo!” 
Banane came. The gentleman did not want her; she would rot too 
quickly. 
The mother called: “ Pacane oh! orimomo, orimomo!” Pacane 
came. The gentleman said Pacane would become rancid. At last 
the mother called: “La Graisse oh! orimomo, orimomo!” La 
Graisse came. As soon as he saw her he took her, and led her to his 
beautiful house and married her. 
The king’s son went hunting every day. While he was not there, 
the servants tormented La Graisse. She was afraid to tell her hus- 
band, and she did all they wanted. One day the cook told her that 
she did not want to cook the dinner; that La Graisse had to do it 
herself. Poor La Graisse! she cried and cried, but they forced her 
to stay by the fire. But she was melting and melting: in the end, 
there was nothing but La Graisse (grease). everywhere ; the kitchen 
was full of it.

    120 Appendix. 
The little bird of La Graisse saw that. It dipped its wings into 
the grease; it flew in the wood to the gentleman; it flapped its 
wings in his face. The gentleman saw the grease which was on the 
wings; he thought of his dear La Graisse; he galloped home; he 
found his wife all melted on the floor. He was so sorry that he 
picked up all the grease and put it in an old bath-tub, and when the 
grease was cold it became a woman again. But she was never as 
_ pretty as before ; for the earth had mixed with the grease, and she 
was all yellow and dirty. Her husband did not love her any more, 
and sent her back to her mother. 
XIII. Zhe Golden Fish. 
There was once a young girl who had a lover. It was a fine young 
man, a prince, but the father did not want him to court his daughter. 
He went to see an old wizard, who lived in the woods, and said to 
him: “TI pray you, wizard, make that young man leave my daughter 
alone. I do not want them to marry.” 
One day the young girl and the young man were seated on the 
river bank ; the wizard came and changed the young man into a fish, 
which jumped into the water. 
The father thought that the young girl would forget the young 
man, now that he was a fish, and he did not watch her any more; 
but every day the young girl would sit on the river bank and sing: 
“ Caliwa wa, caliwa co; waco, moman dit oui; waco, popa dit non; 
caliwa wa, caliwa co.” 
As soon as she sang that the water opened, and a beautiful red 
fish, with a golden crown. on his head, came near the young girl. 
He brought her cakes, oranges, apples, for her to eat. 
The father perceived that the young girl went every day to the 
river bank. One day he watched her, and saw what she was doing. 
The next day he brought his gun with him ; and when the girl sang, 
and the beautiful fish came, he killed it, and took it home to cook it. 
The young girl was told to cook the fish. When she took it to 
cut it, the fish began to sing: “Cut me then, wa, wa; scrape me 
then, wa, wa; mix me then, wa, wa; put some salt, wa, wa.” 
When the fish was cooked they placed it on the table. The young 
girl did not want to eat, and cried for her fish ; but the father was so 
greedy and ate so much that his belly burst, and a quantity of little 
fishes came out and escaped to the water. 
After the dinner the young girl went to sit down on the river 
bank, where they had thrown the scales of her fish. She wept so 
much that the earth opened, and she disappeared in the hole to go to 
meet her fish. When her mother came to look for her, she saw only 
one lock of her daughter’s hair which was coming out of the earth.

XIV. “ Give Me.” 
Once there was a lady who resided in a beautiful house. She had 
been married a long time, but had no children. One day that she 
was standing on her gallery, she saw an old woman who was passing 
with a basket of apples on her head. When the lady saw the 
beautiful apples she wished to eat one; she called the old woman, 
and told her that she wanted to buy an apple. The old merchant- 
woman did not want to sell an apple; but she gave one to the lady, 
and said : — 
“1 know that you wish to have a child; eat this apple, and 
to-morrow you will be the mother of a beautiful boy.” 
The young woman took the apple, laughing, and pared it. She 
threw the peel in the yard, and ate the apple. 
The old woman had not lied; during the night the lady gave 
birth to a fine boy, and what is very strange is that a mare which 
was in the yard ate the apple-peels, and she had a foal during the 
night. 
The lady was very glad to have a child; and she said that as the 
little horse was born the same night as the little boy, it should be 
his property. 
Both grew up together, and they loved each other very much. As 
the little horse was born through a miracle, he could be saddled and 
bridled without any one touching him. When the boy wanted to 
ride, he cried: “Saddle and bridle, my little horse!” and the horse 
came immediately, all ready to be mounted. 
When the boy grew up, he was tired of remaining at his mother’s, 
and set out to seek adventures. He said to no one where he was 
going, mounted his horse, and travelled for a long time, until he 
arrived in the country of a great king. 
One evening he came to a beautiful house; they told him that 
it was the residence of the king, and that lie had a very pretty 
daughter. 
The young man wanted to see the princess, therefore he de- 
scended from his horse and made him disappear; for I ought to 
have told you that the horse could disappear whenever his master 
wished it, and he himself could change his clothes according to his 
desire, taking sometimes the clothes of a beggar, and sometimes the 
clothes of a prince. 
On that day, he dressed like a beggar, and went towards the 
kitchen. He acted as if he could not speak well, and every time 
they poke to him he answered but two words: “Give me.” “You 
are hungry?” “Give me.’’—‘“You are thirsty?” ‘Give me.” 
They called him Give me, and they allowed him to sleep in the
-P-A-G-E-134
    122 Appendix, 
kitchen, in the ashes. He helped the servants of the king, and they 
thought he was an idiot. 
The whole week Give me remained in the kitchen, but when 
Sunday came, and every one had gone to mass, he put on his best 
clothes, ordered his horse to appear with saddle and bridle, and 
began to gallop all over the garden of the king. He broke the 
flower-pots, the young plants; nothing could stop him. On that 
very day the daughter of the king was sick, and she did not go to 
mass. She remained at home, and looked in the garden through 
the window. She saw Give me, and she found him very handsome. 
Give me stopped galloping in the garden when he thought the 
mass was almost finished. He made his horse disappear, and went 
back to the kitchen with his beggar’s clothes. 
When the king came back he was furious to see the damage 
which had been done in his garden. He summoned his servants, 
but they said that Give me was the only person who had remained 
at home. The king questioned him, but he replied all the time, 
“ Give me.” 
The next Sunday the same thing happened again, and the daughter 
of the king remained at home to see Give me. The king was so 
angry that he said he would catch the rascal who was spoiling his 
garden. On the third Sunday he did not go to mass, but he hid 
himself in the house. He caught Give me, who was dressed like a 
prince and galloping in the garden on his horse. 
The king'was very much astonished, and he asked the handsome 
young man to relate his story. 
Give me told him how he was born, and made his horse appear 
and disappear, and changed his clothes at his will. 
He told the king that he was in love with his daughter, and asked 
her in marriage. The king said yes, and Give me married the prin- 
cess, and sent for his mother. 
They lived a long time, and were very happy, because it was a good 
old witch who had given Give me’s mother the apple to eat.

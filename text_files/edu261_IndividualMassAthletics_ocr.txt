    PREFACE 
The writer has had a two-fold purpose in preparing the manu- 
script for this book; (1) to assemble the widely scattered in- 
dividual athletic events, and (2) to outline the various methods of 
athletic competition. 
The average individual thinks of these two matters in terms 
of a regular track and field program—the twelve or fourteen 
events which comprise the usual meet such as the hundred yard 
dash, the running broad jump, the shot put, and so on, and the 
place method of conduct whereby each contestant’s record is 
measured in terms of distance, height, time and number, and 
places are awarded according to performance. These events and 
this method of conduct, however, represent but a very small part 
of the field. 
In addition to the regular track and field events, we have a 
number of events which have a history of former usage in the track 
and field program, a number of events which have long held a 
place in our folk pastimes, still others that have been invented to 
test certain physical abilities, and still others that have been drafted 
from the elements of our standard organized games. 
And in addition to the place method of conduct, we have a 
number of other methods of carrying on these activities which are 
equally satisfactory and under some conditions superior in effective- 
ness and results. 
As stated before, the assemblage of this material represents 
the field of this book. In the interest of this undertaking over two 
hundred irregular individual athletic events and eleven different 
methods of conduct are covered. In addition, for the purpose of 
clarifying the methods of use, more than three score athletic com- 
petitions are outlined. 
One of the men who read the original manuscript has pointed 
out that the title “Individual and Mass Athletics” may be a trifle 
misleading in that the word ‘athletics’ to many implies adult 
activities when in reality the material is adapted for use with all 
ages between nine and thirty. The writer wishes to make it ab- 
solutely clear that these activities, properly selected, are useful in 
the intermediate grades, Junior High School, Senior High School 
and College. Those who are interested in securing definite material

for use with these several groups are referred to the Index where 
some detailed suggestions are assembled. 
Individual athletics is defined as including all big muscle 
activities which are measurable in terms of time, number and space, 
Mass athletics is nothing more than group competitions in the 
individual activities. : 
It is beyond the realm of possibility to cover a field so vast and 
intricate in all its details and variations as this field, in one volume, 
and the writer in no way feels that this has been done. He does 
feel, however, that the material presented will provide the physical 
director, the play leader and the social worker with a fund of sug- 
gestions from which he can draw to shape up his own programs. 
It should be of real assistance to the new instructor who is eternally 
faced with the problem, “What shall I do today?” The school 
teacher, both rural and urban, interested in creating a little diver- 
sion should find it helpful. And those assigned the task of shaping 
picnic or outing programs should find it stimulating and suggestive. 
The writer’s experience has been confined largely to work with 
men and boys and the book is naturally flavored with this type of 
activity. This is so true that the inexperienced instructor might 
even draw the conclusion that the work was adapted only to men 
and boys. To forestall any such misconception it is pointed out 
with the utmost emphasis that this type of activity is equally as 
well suited for use with girls as it is with boys. Girls and boys 
are instinctively more or less alike and for the most part those 
events which appeal to boys make an equal appeal to girls. Due to 
a considerable difference in the physical make-up and difference in 
the play life certain events are better suited to one group than the 
other, but in general the same types appeal to both. 
While some of the material is “old stuff” to experienced in- 
structors and supervisors and some of it is available in printed 
form in the literature, much of it is original and the result of the 
writer’s own experience. Work in the Y. M. C. A., boys’ clubs, 
high schools, college and the army, and on the playground has 
provided ample opportunity to test out the ideas under all sorts of 
conditions. Fifteen years of experience with all types of work has 
resulted in a decided enthusiasm for the sort of activity suggested 
here. 
In closing this brief preface the helpful cooperation of as- 
sociates and students in the coaching school at the University of 
Illinois is acknowledged.

Introduction 
Our physical training activities program includes a host of 
activities ranging from free play to highly organized games. Yet 
as Hetherington in his “School Program in Physical Education” 
points out, the program should be centered about individual events 
rather than group events. He says “The plan should be centered 
in an organization of individual events selected from most or all 
of the broad groups of natural and related big-muscle activities. 
By individual activities as used here is meant those activities in 
which each individual carries on the whole activity by himself 
without dependence on the activities of others.” 
Advantages of Individual Events. 
The advantages in using individual events are as follows: (1) 
They can be organized and carried on in the instructional periods 
as well as the play periods—in other words they are adapted 
for use both under compulsion and voluntary participation. (2) 
Anyone, trained and untrained alike, can teach them; the funda- 
mental technical principles involved can be readily acquired by any- 
one required to teach these activities. Thus from the standpoint 
of promotion and administration they are easy to handle. (3) 
Each pupil progresses as an individual. The individual’s per- 
formance rests entirely with himself; he cannot blame poor per- 
formance on anyone but himself, nor can he rest on laurels gained 
by others as a player on a team may. 
(4) Each pupil may be taught as an individual. In team games 
two factors are involved in teaching,—individual technique and 
team strategy. Individual technique is comparatively simple and 
easy to teach. On the other hand, team strategy is very difficult 
to teach and learn. In teaching individual events we have but one 
factor—individual technique.. Thus by using individual events we 
reduce the teaching problem to its smallest compass. (5) They 
can be practiced when learned by the individual himself; continual 
coaching is not necessary. (6) They can be engaged in by the in- 
1
-P-A-G-E-10
  2 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
dividual alone or by a group of any reasonable size. To play a 
game a group is necessary. If a group is present individual events 
may be practiced and yet a group is not necessary to this practice 
—they may be practiced alone, or by a pair, or three or four. 
(7) They may be practiced under a great variety of conditions— 
in the gymnasium, in the back yard, on the playground, in the 
street, in the schoolroom, in the home, and in rural and urban 
districts alike. (8) They can be readily graded according to in- 
dividual or group needs and ability. In other words, standards of 
performance can be established for all ages, all weights, all school 
grades, all heights or any other quality or combination of the 
same that may seem desirable. (9) They give training in a host 
of utilitarian activities,—activities which are useful in everyday 
play and work—running, jumping, vaulting, throwing, climbing, 
ete. (10) They require each individual to give all he has in each 
performance,—this is necessary to make a good showing. 
Most of the activities included in our physical training program 
are of an individual nature or may be individualized to conform to — 
our requirements, but of these various types individual athletic 
events are the most practical and successful. They are unique in 
being accurately measurable, thus calling into play the element of 
competition which affords a powerful incentive to practice and 
participation. Each individual by comparing present performances 
with past performances actually sets up a situation whereby he 
competes with himself. He can compare his records with other 
members of his own group. If average performance records are 
kept, as in Detroit, the individual can compare his own records 
with these. And finally comparison with championship records— 
school, city, state, national and Olympic—are possible. He thus 
has an accurate gauge of his own ability and a constant stimulus and 
incentive to improve it. 
Five Types of Events. 
Individual athletic events are usually conceived of in terms ot 
the regular track and field events,—100 yd. dash, running broad 
jump, shot put and so on. ‘These events are quite properly 
grouped here but in the broader sense the classification is not 
limited to these events alone. As defined here the type is expanded 
to include all individual athletic activities that are measurable in 
terms of time, space or number. There are literally scores of
-P-A-G-E-11
INTRODUCTION 3 
activities which can be included under this classification. Indi- 
vidual athletic events come from five general sources. 
In the first group we have the events mentioned above—100 
yd. dash, shot put, etc.—events included in our regular track and 
field program. : 
In the second group we haye the standing high jump, the hop, 
step and jump, the hammer throw, and so on, events which have a 
history of former usage in our organized athletic program but 
which have now practically disappeared. 
In the third group we have the sit-ups, the spider jump, the bar 
snap for distance, the sky jump and so on—events invented to exer- 
cise or test strength, endurance, skill and other abilities of large- 
muscle groups. 
In the fourth group we have the three pegs, the pirouette, the 
running high touch, the zig-zag and similar events which have 
been carried on informally for ages but which have never been in- 
cluded in organized competition. This group includes the large 
number of activities so popular a generation or two back when- 
ever boys, and men, too, chanced to collect—during recess, after 
school, and at twilight—but which, studies show, are fast passing 
into oblivion. These might be really classed as folk athletic events. 
In the fifth group we have a great number of events taken from 
the elements of our great organized games: pitching, running the 
bases, baseball far throw and so on from baseball; free throwing, 
goal shooting for speed, basketball dribble and so on from basket- 
ball; corner kicking, bounce kicking and so on from soccer; for- 
ward passing for distance, place kicking for distance, punting for* 
distance, and other events from rugby; tennis serving from tennis; 
volley ball serving from volley ball; driving for distance, putting 
for accuracy, approaching for accuracy and similar events from 
golf; horseshoe pitching from horseshoes; and driving for goal 
from field hockey. 
Practical Utility of Individual Athletic Events. 
The use of individual athletic events of the variety outlined 
above is a very practical and worthwhile procedure from several 
points of view. 
(1) In the first place everyone can make some sort of a showing 
on the first attempt and everyone likes to execute them. Every 
boy is curious to know how fast he can run 100 yards, how far he 
can throw a baseball, how far he can jump, etc. This condition of
-P-A-G-E-12
    4 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
being inherently interesting and enjoyable makes their use and 
organization exceedingly simple and easy. 
(2) Through the use of events abstracted from our organized 
games we provide training in a host of fundamentals of these 
games. A boy or girl who has practiced the basketball dribble, the 
free throw, the one hand shot, the goal shooting for speed, basket- 
ball far throw, and the outer circle throw should play a better 
game of basketball. The value of this sort of training cannot be 
overestimated. 
(3) Through the general use and promotion of events taken 
from our regular track and field program we provide definite train- 
ing in a major sport for the masses. The average and poor per- 
formers are entitled to as much attention and consideration as 
given those who excel and comprize the varsity team. Latent tal- 
ent may be discovered that the possessor himself did not know 
existed. 
(4) Then too, by giving our boys and girls and young men and 
young women training in the technique of these various activities 
we increase the number of those who have technical knowledge of 
athletics which makes for a wider and finer appreciation of them. 
The art connoisseur enjoys paintings more than the layman. The 
skilled bridge player appreciates the game more than the beginner. 
One having technical knowledge of athletics appreciates them 
more than one who has never played. Athletic sport occupies a 
prominent place in our modern scheme of life. Everyone should 
be acquainted with the fundamentals of our various athletic 
‘activities. ; 
(5) It is impossible to overstate the significance and value of 
reviving the athletic pastimes informally practiced by our fore- 
fathers. The quarter hammon, half hammon, whole hammon, neck 
flip, crawl stretch and similar events, in years past, have provided 
boys with many hours of vigorous, funful, wholesome recreation. 
And in the smaller towns the grown-ups too, not infrequently 
staged contests in these activities. The swimming hole, the back 
lot, the village store, the blacksmith shop and the churchyard have 
been the scenes of many informal competitions of this nature. 
These events so popular in our elder’s day would be equally popu- 
lar today if proper conditions were provided. The fact that they 
were practiced without organized stimulation demonstrates that 
they possess qualities which make them intrinsically interesting. The 
crowded city with its multitude of passive attractions have forced 
them out. We should attend to preserving them. Every play-
-P-A-G-E-13
  INTRODUCTION 5 
ground and school in the nation should foster these activities for 
the purpose of providing our boys and girls with something they 
can engage in during their leisure moments. As they developed 
grit, courage, pep, muscle, and endurance for our progenitors so 
will they for posterity. 
(6) And lastly, events of this sort provide the only means we 
have of testing individual physical ability. Strength, endurance, 
neuromuscular condition, throwing ability, kicking ability, jumping 
ability, vaulting ability, climbing ability, and so on may all be 
tested. Through testing performance in one or two representative 
events from each distinct type of activity we can determine the 
individual’s general physical condition—where he is weak and 
where he is strong,—and by applying the knowledge gained, weak 
abilities can be developed and all-around condition gained. 
Methods of Use. 
The question now arises, how can these activities be used? 
They may be used in a great variety of ways. The most important 
use of all perhaps consists of instituting this work as a major 
phase of our school program in physical education through a com- 
prehensive scheme of organization and training in which everyone 
takes part. In addition they may be used intermittently at the will 
of the instructor. They may be highly organized as in a dual 
track and field meet, or they may be quite informal as on a picnic. 
They may be organized on the event basis or the meet basis. They 
may be organized and carried on with teams as the unit of competi- 
tion, with individuals as the unit of competition, or both. They 
may be organized and completed at one meeting or they may be 
extended over a period of several meetings. They may be used 
with small or large groups with equal facility and success. They 
may be used with both sexes and all ages from ten to forty. They 
may be organized for the purpose of testing individual all-around 
physical ability as in the pentathlon, decathlon or all-around 
competition. Or they may be organized for the purpose of testing 
collective or group ability from which an indication of average 
ability is derived. 
Methods of Conduct. 
Finally, and most important of all, they may be carried on by 
several different methods of conduct: (1) the place method, (2) 
the mass method, (3) the modified mass method, (4) the relay
-P-A-G-E-14
  
  6 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETCS 
method, (5) the shuttle method, (6) the cumulative method, (7) 
the elimination method, (8) the tournament method, (9) the rank 
method, (10) the zone method, (11) the point method, and (12) 
the group method. 
The average individual thinks of athletic competition in terms 
of a place meet in which the contestants’ performances are ac- 
curately measured and places are awarded according to these per- 
formances. The place method, however, represents only one 
method of conduct. It is the best method perhaps when the com- 
petition is highly organized as for varsity sports, and it serves very 
satisfactorily under conditions of low organization, but the fact 
remains that there are at least eleven other distinct methods of 
conduct which give equally satisfactory results for general group 
recreational purposes. Repeated experiment and usage has proven 
beyond question that these methods of conduct are wholly prac- 
tical, interesting and successful. So, in addition to having a host 
of activities to select from, the instructor is also afforded a selec- 
tion in choosing the method of conduct. 
In view of the fact that the various individual athletic events 
and the various methods of conduct are not generally known the 
present work is devoted to their compilation.

Individual Athletic Events 
& 
The number of individual athletic events which may be used 
for testing and competitive purposes is almost unlimited. We have 
first a large number of regular track and field events. In view of 
the fact that the rules for executing these events are generally 
known and further that they are readily accessible in a number of 
publications these will not be discussed here. To make the present 
work complete, however, they are listed below. 
4o yd. run Standing Broad Jump 
50 yd. run Running Broad Jump 
60 yd. run Standing High Jump 
75 yd. run Running High Jump 
roo yd, run Shot Put (8 pounds) 
220 yd. run Shot Put (12 pounds)

75 yd. low hurdles Discus Throw (Junior size) 
120 yd. high hurdles Pole Vault for height 
220 yd. low hurdles 
Second, as pointed out before, we have a great number of 
miscellaneous events which have been taken from several sources; 
some have been taken from our standard athletic games, some have 
a history of former usage, some have been used in informal com- 
petition, and some have been devised for this special purpose. A 
few of these irregular events are known but the majority are not. 
In lieu of the fact that there are no published rules for the great 
mass of these events an attempt has been made in the following 
pages to set down rules of competition for these which the writer 
has found to be the most popular and practical. These rules are 
based on a considerable amount of experiment and experience and 
in the majority of cases will be found to be quite satisfactory. 
7
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
Rules May be Changed. 
On the subject of rules, however, it is pointed out that the in- 
structor should not be ‘hide bound” to them. Local conditions, 
equipment and the ability of specific groups and individuals often 
warrant slight modifications that in no way affect the spirit of the 
competition. When this occurs there is no reason why the rules 
cannot be altered and satisfactory competition provided. It is 
folly to let a petty rule interfere with performance of a desirable 
worthwhile event. In chinning the bar for instance boys are al- 
most bound to kick and swing; this can be easily overlooked, and 
further, is it not feasible to place a hand on them and stop 
their swinging? In some of the throwing events boys will in- 
advertently walk over the throwing line after making a fair throw. 
Why not overlook this? The throw has been fair and in walking 
over the line the contestant has merely violated a technicality. 
In drawing up the rules for these events no attempt has been 
made to cover all possible situations. Local needs will frequently 
make alterations desirable. For instance in the rope skipping 
events the rules cover a thirty seconds’ rope skip only; it may be de- 
sirable to use orie minute or two minutes. In the rope climbing 
events eighteen feet is the stipulated height; if the rope in the 
local gymnasium hangs from a beam 20 feet or 22 feet from the 
floor, use that height,—let the contestants touch the beam. The 
instructor should not hesitate to adopt measures of this nature to 
meet the local situation. 
RUNNING TYPE EVENTS + 
1. 15 yd. Race * 
This event is really nothing more than the “start” of the regu- 
lar straight-away run. To carry on the event establish two 
parallel lines fifteen yards apart. To execute the event the con- 
testant assumes the crouch starting position behind the starting 
line and on the signal ‘“‘On your mark,—Get set,—Go,” runs to the 
finish line. The race is judged as the regular straight-away. 
2. Lap Race * 
One lap, two lap, three lap, and five lap races are very popular 
in gymnasiums where indoor tracks are available. Races of this 
1 Note: Events marked with an asterisk * may be used with girls and women as well as with boys and men.
-P-A-G-E-17
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 9 
sort are also used considerably on playgrounds and on the gym- 
nasium floor where tracks are constructed by placing four objects 
such as chairs, Indian clubs, medicine balls and so on in rectangle 
fashion; the track lies outside of these objects. Races of this sort 
are conducted as the regular straight-away events. 
3. Walking Race * 
This event is performed as the running race except that the 
contestants walk instead of run. To be legal the contestant must 
place the heel of the advancing foot on the ground before the toe 
of the trailing foot leaves it; any one failing to do this is elim- 
inated. Any distance between 40 and 440 yards makes a good 
race. 
4. Backward Running Race * 
To perform this event the contestant stands behind the starting 
line with his back toward the finish line. The contestant, traveling 
backward, covers the prescribed course. In running the contestant 
must hold his back toward the finish line but may turn his head and 
look over his shoulder. Any contestant who fails to run backward 
or runs out of his course is eliminated. The race is conducted the 
same as the straight-away. Any distance from 20 to 60 yards 
makes a good race. 
5. Measuring Feet Race * 
To perform this event the contestant advances from the starting 
line to the finish line with rapid steps, placing each foot down so 
the heel of the advancing foot touches the toe of the supporting 
foot as though he were measuring the number of foot lengths be- 
tween the two lines. Any contestant who fails to touch the heel of 
his advancing foot to the toe of his supporting foot is eliminated. 
The race is started and judged as the regular straight-away event. 
From 10 to 20 yards makes a good race. 
6. Hopping Race * 
To execute this event the contestant stands on one foot behind 
the starting line and on the signal “go” hops forward on that 
foot to the finish line. The contestant is not allowed to touch the 
other foot to the ground at any time during his progress; to do so 
constitutes a foul and eliminates the contestant. From 20 to 50 
yards makes. a satisfactory race according to the ability of the 
group taking part.
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
7. Gallop Race * 
To perform this event the contestant stands in back of the start- 
ing line with either the left foot or right foot advanced. Retain- 
ing the feet in the.starting order the contestant gallops forward. 
The foot which was forward at the start must remain forward 
throughout the race. Any contestant failing to travel in exactly this 
manner is eliminated. The race is started and judged as the regu- 
’ lar straight-away. From 40 to 100 yards makes a good race. 
8. Heel Run Race * 
To perform this race the contestant, traveling with short rapid 
strides, runs forward on his heels. The toes should be kept free 
of the ground throughout the race; any contestant violating this rule 
should be eliminated. The race is conducted as the regular 
straight-away. From 20 to 40 yards makes a good race. 
9. Stiff Knee Race * 
To perform this race the contestant, holding his knees stiff, runs 
forward. Any player bending his knees is eliminated. The race 
is started and judged as the regular straight-away run. From 20 
to 50 yards makes a good race. 
10. Skipping Race * 
To execute this race the contestants skip from the starting line 
to the finish line. Skipping is done in the following manner; step 
on right foot, quick hop on right foot, step on left foot, quick hop 
on left foot, step on right foot, quick hop on right foot, and so on. 
Any contestant who fails to travel in the prescribed manner is im- 
mediately eliminated. The race is conducted as any other race. 
From 20 to 60 yards is satisfactory for most races. 
11. Alternate Hop Race * 
To perform this event the contestant advances by alternately 
hopping and stepping on each foot, i.e., hop on left foot, step on 
right foot, hop on right foot, step on left foot, hop on left foot, 
and so on. Any contestant who fails to travel in the prescribed 
manner is eliminated. The race is started and judged as the regular 
straight-away run. From 40 yards to 100 yards makes a good race. 
Note that this is not a skipping race; it is a continuous succession
-P-A-G-E-19
  
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 11

51. Potato Race. (8 potatoes) 
To carry on this event it is necessary to have eight potatoes for 
each contestant. Blocks of wood about two inches square or 
stones of the same size serve very well for potatoes. Make the 
following arrangements for each contestant. Establish a circle 
one foot in diameter. Establish eight spots two yards apart start- 
ing from the center of the circle. Establish a line running through 
the eighth spot running at right angles to the circle; this is the 
finish line. Place a potato on each spot. To perform the race the 
contestant stands behind the circle. On the signal “Go” he runs 
forward and, picking up one potato, runs back-and puts it in the 
circle. Then he runs forward, picks up another and places it in the 
circle, and so on until all have been collected. When all of the 
potatoes are lodged in the circle the contestant runs to the finish 
line. The contestant may pick up the potatoes in any order he 
wishes but once he has touched one he must place it fairly inside 
the circle before he can touch another. Any player failing to do 
this is eliminated. The race is started and judged as any other 
race. The above race is best suited for use with adults but may be 
used for senior high school boys also. (Baskets may be used in 
place of circles.) (Dia. 5.)

This event is carried on as the single standing broad jump 
except that the contestant jumps twice instead of once. To execute 
the jump the contestant toes the take-off line and makes two 
successive forward jumps. The second jump must be made in 
immediate continuation of the first. Outdoors either a pit or the 
bare ground may be used; indoors a mat or the bare floor may be 
used. When a pit is used the take-off should be established so 
that the first jump lands short of the pit and the second jump lands 
in it. The point nearest the take-off touched by the contestant 
after the second jump is taken as the mark. The distance from the 
take-off to the mark represents the contestant’s record.

be placed so the last jump places the contestant in the pit. The 
point nearest the take-off touched by the contestant after the third 
jump is taken as the mark. The distance from the take-off to the 
mark represents his record. 
59. Seven Jumps 
Outdoors this event may be carried on on any level piece of 
ground; indoors it may be carried on on the bare fluor or on the 
mats. If mats are used they should be firmly fastened together. 
To perform this event the contestant toes the take-off and makes 
seven jumps forward. The jumps should be made in immediate 
succession without pause. Failure to keep the feet together and 
failure to make the jumps in immediate succession constitute trials 
without record. The point nearest the take-off touched by the con- 
testant after the seventh jump. is taken as the mark. The distance 
between the take-off and mark represents his record. 
60. Running Double Broad Jump * 
This event is carried on as the regular running broad jump ex- 
cept that the contestant jumps off of both feet at the take-off. 
Thus the order of procedure is, run forward, jump onto both feet 
at the take-off, and jump forward as far as possible landing on 
both feet. The contestant’s feet must be together at the time of 
taking off. The mark is set and the distance measured as in the 
running broad jump. } 
61. Spider Jump * 
To execute this jump the contestant stands toeing the take-off. 
Then, jumping off both feet, he leaps forward, swings his legs up 
in front, touches the toes of both feet with his hands, and lands on 
both feet, attempting to cover as much ground as possible. Failure 
to touch the toes with both hands before landing counts as a trial  
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
without record. The mark is set and the distance measured as in 
the standing broad jump. 
62. Kangaroo Jump * 
To execute this jump the contestant stands toeing the take-off 
line; then jumping off of both feet he leaps forward, swings his 
heels up behind, touches his heels with his hands and lands on both 
feet attempting to cover as much ground as possible. Failure to 
touch the heels with both hands before landing constitutes a foul . 
and a trial without record. The mark is set and the distance 
measured as in the standing broad jump. 
63. Standing Broad Hop * 
This event is carried on the same as the standing broad jump. 
It may be carried on either indoors or out of doors. To perform 
  FIG, II. STARTING POSITION, STANDING 
BROAD HOP, STEP AND JUMP AND “THREE 
PEGS” 
the event the contestant, standing on one foot, toes the take-off 
mark and hops forward landing on the same foot. The contestant 
must keep his raised foot off the floor until after the hop is
-P-A-G-E-41
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 33 
definitely completed, and he must avoid touching his hands and 
body to the floor. (He may hop forward). If he fails in either 
of these respects the hop counts as a trial without record. The 
distance is measured from the heel mark nearest the jumping line 
to a point on the jumping line at right angles to the same. 
(Fig. 11). 
64. Running Broad Hop * 
This event is similar to the running broad jump with the excep- 
tion that the contestant hops instead of jumps. It may be carried 
on indoors or out of doors. If carried on indoors a mat should 
be used. To perform the event the contestant runs to the take-off, 
leaps off of one foot from behind the take-off line and lands on the 
same foot. The contestant must keep his raised foot off of the 
ground and avoid touching the ground with his hands or body 
until after he has fully demonstrated that he has control of his 
~ balance on one leg after the hop. If he fails in this, the hop counts 
as a foul and a trial without record. The distance is measured 
from the heel mark nearest the take-off to a point on the take-off 
line at right angles to the same. 
65. Hopping Broad Hop * 
This event is similar to the running broad hop. To perform 
the event the contestant hops to the take-off on one foot, hops from 
the take-off on the same foot, and lands on the same foot. Fouls 
are recorded, the mark is set, the distance measured and the event 
is otherwise conducted as the running broad hop. 
66. Double Hop * 
This event is carried on as the standing broad hop with the ex- 
ception that the contestant hops twice instead of once. The second 
hop is made in immediate continuation of the first. The contestant 
must keep his raised foot off of the floor until after the second hop 
is definitely completed. Failure to make the second hop without 
pause, or failure to hold the upraised foot from the floor consti- 
tutes a foul and a trial without record. The mark-is established 
at the point nearest the take-off touched by the contestant on his 
second hop. The distance is measured the same as the broad jump. 
67. Three Pegs * 
This event may be carried on indoors or out of doors. If car- 
ried on out of doors the contestant should have three pegs, four  
-P-A-G-E-42
  St INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
or five inches long and sharpened so they may be stuck in the 
ground. Nails will do very well. Indoors a piece of chalk may be 
used. In performing the event the contestant, standing on one 
foot, toes the starting line. He hops forward, landing on the 
leaping foot; then bending down puts one peg in the ground 
directly in back of the heel of his supporting foot. He then rises 
and hops forward again placing the second peg as he did the first. 
The third hop follows. On completing the third hop the contestant 
   FIG. 12. MARKING BEHIND HEEL IN FIG. 13. THE LAST MARK IN THE THREE 
THREE PEGS PEGS 
bends forward, reaches out, sticks the third peg in the ground as 
far forward as he can, and then rises to the upright position. 
When this is completed he may put down his uplifted foot. 
If the contestant fails to hold the place of landing (takes addi- 
tional hops), fails to rise to a balance after placing a peg, places 
the raised foot on the ground, or touches his hands to the ground 
at any time during the performance it is counted as a trial without 
record. The distance is measured from the last peg to a point on 
the jumping line at right angles to the same. Note: It is a good 
idea, especially with beginners, to allow the contestant to wiggle 
his foot along the ground in an effort to maintain his balance after
-P-A-G-E-43
  
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 35 
hopping sideward so long as he does not wiggle forward or hop 
about. (Figs: 11, 12; 13): 
68. Seven Hops 
Outdoors this event may be carried on on any level piece of 
ground. Indoors either the mats or the bare floor may be used. 
If the mats are used they should be firmly fastened together and 
held so they will not slip on the floor. To perform the event the 
contestant stands on one foot with the toe to the take-off and 
executes seven continuous hops forward. There should be no pause 
between hops. The mark is established and the distance measured 
as in the standing broad jump. 
69. Standing Leap and Jump * 
Outdoors a pit may be used for this event but it is not absolutely 
necessary; indoors a mat may be used but again this is not neces- 
sary. If a pit is used, the take-off should be placed so the final 
jump puts the contestant in the pit. To perform the event the 
contestant stands on both feet at the take-off, leaps forward land- 
ing on one foot, and then jumps forward landing on both feet. 
The jump is taken without halt after the leap. The mark is set 
and measured as in the broad jumps. 
70. Standing Hop, Skip and Jump * 
This event may be carried on on any level surface, either in- 
doors or out of doors. To perform the event the contestant stands 
on one foot at the take-off, hops forward landing on the same foot, 
cuts the other foot in back of the hopping foot landing on it, and 
leaps forward onto both feet. From start to finish the perform- 
ance is continuous without a halt. Crow-hopping at the start and 
failure to cut the foot across in back in the second phase of the 
event constitute fouls which are scored as trials without record. 
The mark is set and measured as in the standing broad jump. 
71. Running Hop, Skip and Jump * 
With the exception that the contestant runs to the take-off in- 
stead of standing at it, this event is executed the same as the stand- 
ing hop, skip and jump. Fouls are checked, the mark is set and 
the distance is measured the same as in the previous event.

72. Whole Hammon (standing) 
This event may be carried on on any level surface, either indoors 
or out of doors. To perform the event the contestant stands on 
one foot at the take-off, hops forward and lands on the same foot, 
hops forward and lands on the same foot, steps forward on the 
other foot, steps forward on the other foot, leaps forward onto 
both feet, and jumps forward onto both feet. The event is in 
reality two hops, two steps, and two jumps made in continuous 
succession. Failure to perform the event correctly constitutes a 
foul and is recorded as a trial without record. The mark is set 
and the distance is measured as in the standing broad jump. 
73. Whole Hammon (running) 
This event is the same as the standing event with the exception 
that the contestant runs to the take-off. Fouls are checked, the 
mark is set, and the distance measured as in the previous event. 
74. Standing Hop, Step and Jump * 
Outdoors this event may be carried on with or without a jump- 
ing pit; indoors with or without mats. If a jumping pit is used the 
take-off should be arranged so that on the final jump the contestant 
lands in the pit. To perform the event the contestant stands on 
one foot at the take-off, hops forward and lands on the same foot, 
steps forward on the other foot and leaps forward landing on 
both feet. From start to finish the performance is continuous 
without halt. ‘‘Crow-hopping” at the start is illegal. The mark 
is set and measured as in the standing broad jump. (Fig. 11.) 
75. Running Hop, Step and Jump * 
This event is the same as the standing hop, step and jump ex- 
cept that the contestant runs to the take-off. Fouls are checked 
and the mark is set and measured the same as in the running broad 
jump. 
76. Zig-Zag 
This event may be carried on on any level piece of ground, 
either indoors or out of doors. This event may be executed start- 
ing with either foot; our descriptions will be starting with the 
left foot. To perform the event the contestant stands with both  
-P-A-G-E-45
  
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 37 
feet toeing the take-off, leaps forward landing on the left foot, 
cuts the right foot across in back of the left, steps forward on the 
left foot, steps forward with the right foot, cuts the left foot 
across in back of the right, steps forward on the right foot, steps 
forward on the left foot and leaps forward onto both feet. Any 
attempt in which the contestant fails to execute the event exactly 
as prescribed constitutes a trial without record. The point nearest 
the take-off touched by the contestant on his final jump is es- 
tablished as his mark. The distance is measured as in the broad 
jump. 
77. Standing Broad Step * 
This event may be carried on on any level piece of ground, either 
indoors or out of doors. To execute the event the contestant 
stands on one foot toeing the take-off and leaps forward landing 
on the other foot. The uplifted foot may be swung back and forth 
preparatory to making the leap but the supporting foot must be 
kept on the ground; there must be no preliminary hop. In the 
course of the step the foot off which the contestant sprung must 
be kept off of the ground until after the contestant has definitely 
landed on the other. Crow-hopping and touching the leaping 
foot to the ground in the course of the step counts as trial without 
record. ‘The mark is set and the distance measured as in the 
standing broad jump. 
78. Seven Steps 
This event may be carried on on any level piece of ground, 
either indoors or out of doors. To perform the event the con- 
testant stands on both feet toeing the take-off. Then, leaping 
forward off of both feet he lands on one foot, and continues for- 
ward taking six steps, then taking a final leap the contestant lands 
on both feet. The seventh leap thus is in reality a jump. The 
point of ground nearest the take-off touched on the seventh leap is 
established as the mark. The distance from the take-off to the 
mark is taken as the contestant’s record. 
79. Standing Sideward Broad Jump * 
This event may be carried on on any level piece of ground, 
either indoors or out of doors. The event may be executed either 
to the left or right; in competition the contestant may choose 
either way. To execute the event the contestant stands with feet 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
together with the side of one foot just inside of the edge of the 
take-off. Then, leaping off of both feet simultaneously, he jumps 
sideward and lands on both feet. The feet should be kept together 
and the body must face at right angles to the direction of jumping 
throughout the performance. Failure to do either or both of 
these constitutes a foul and a trial without record. The point 
nearest the take-off touched by the contestant is established as his 
mark. The distance is measured from the mark to a point on the 
take-off at right angles to the same. 
80. Sideward Leap * 
This event may be carried on on any level piece of ground, 
either indoors or out of doors. The event may be executed either 
to the left or to the right; our description will be to the right. 
The contestant stands on his left foot at the take-off facing at a 
left angle to the direction of the proposed jump. Then, leaping 
sideward off of the left foot, he lands on the right foot. The right 
foot may be swung sideward preparatory to making the leap, but 
the left foot must be kept firmly on the ground; there must be 
no preliminary hop. In the course of the leap the left foot must 
be kept clear of the ground until after the contestant has definitely 
landed on the right foot, and then when it is placed on the ground 
it must be placed down to the right of the mark made by the right 
foot. Crow-hopping and touching the left foot to the ground 
between the take-off and the point of landing on the right foot 
counts as a trial without record. The mark is set and the distance 
measured as in the standing sideward jump. 
81. Standing Backward Broad Jump * 
This event is similar to the standing forward jump except that 
the contestant leaps backward instead of forward. To execute the 
jump the contestant stands heeling to take-off line and leaps back- 
ward. The point of ground nearest the take-off touched by the 
contestant is established as the mark. Outdoors either a jumping 
pit or a level piece of ground may be used; indoors a mat or the 
bare floor may be used. The distance is measured as in the standing 
forward jump. 
82. Standing High Hop 
A set of jump stands and a cross bar are needed for this event. 
Outdoors the event may be carried on on the bare ground; indoors 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 59 
a mat or two should be used for landing. To perform the event 
the contestant stands on one foot in front of the cross bar and 
leaping off of that foot attempts to clear the bar and land on the 
leaping foot on the opposite side. The contestant’s supporting 
foot must not leave the ground preliminary to making the attempt 
and the raised foot must be kept off of the ground until he has 
shown to have controlled himself in the upright position after 
landing. Failure to do either of these constitutes a foul and is 
scored as a trial without record. The bar is raised and measure- 
ments made as in the high jump. 
83. Running High Hurdle 
A set of high jump stands with a cross bar or jump stand rope 
are required for the conduct of this event. To execute the event 
the contestant runs straight at the bar and executes a regular 
hurdle over the bar. In executing the hurdle the contestant steps 
off of one foot, throws the other straight to the front over the 
bar, lands on that foot on the far side and then continues to run 
forward. The body is kept square to the front throughout the 
hurdle. Failure to land on the leading foot and take a step for- 
ward with the other foot, and failure to keep the body square to 
the front throughout the hurdle constitutes a foul and trial without 
record. The bar is raised as in the regular high jump. 
84. Standing Double High Jump 
This event is carried on as the regular standing high jump with 
the following exceptions: The contestant stands on both feet facing 
the bar; jumps off of both feet simultaneously ; throughout the jump 
he holds his body square to the front; and he lands on both feet 
simultaneously with his back toward the bar. Any jump violating 
any of these rules constitutes a foul and is scored as a trial without 
record. The bar is raised as in the regular high jump. 
85. Running Double High Jump 
This event is carried on as the running high jump with the fol- 
lowing exceptions: The contestant runs straight at the bar, jumps 
off of both feet, holds his body straight to the front throughout the 
jump, and lands on both feet simultaneously with body straight to 
the front. Any jump violating any of these rules constitutes a
-P-A-G-E-48

40 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
foul and is scored as a trial without record. The bar is raised as 
in the regular high jump. 
86. Running Springboard Broad Jump 
A springboard is required for the conduct of this event. Out- 
doors a pit should be used; indoors two or three mats should be 
used for landing purposes. In preparation for the event the 
springboard should be placed in front of the landing place and 
firmly fixed so it will not slide. To perform the jump the contest- 
ant runs and jumps on to the end of the board with both feet, thus 
propelling himself forward, and lands on both feet. The jumper’s 
mark is set at the point nearest the board touched by him. The 
distance is measured from the mark to a point on the floor in line 
with the front of the board. 
87. Running Springboard High Jump 
This event may be used outdoors if a jumping pit is available 
and indoors if plenty of mats are available; indoors there should 
be enough mats to make a landing bed six inches thick. A spring- 
board, jumping stands and a jump stand rope are also necessary. In 
preparing for the event place the springboard just before the land- 
ing bed and place the jump stands from two to three feet in front of 
the end of the springboard. The base of the springboard should 
rest on the floor. To execute the jump the contestant runs and 
jumps on the end of the board with both feet, thus springing up 
and over the rope. To be legal a contestant must jump off of both 
feet, clear the bar, and land on his feet. Somersaults and other 
stunts are not allowed. The rope is raised as in the other high 
jumps. The heights are measured from the floor to the top of the 
rope at the lowest point between the two jump stands. 
88. Standing Broad Dive * 
A mat should be used for this event. A line should be es- 
tablished for a take-off. To perform the event the contestant toes 
the take-off, dives forward landing on his hands and does a for- 
ward roll. ‘‘Crow-hopping,” and failure to do a forward roll at 
the finish, each constitutes a foul and is scored as a trial without 
record. The mark is set at the point nearest the take-off touched 
by the contestant’s hand or head. The distance is measured as the 
broad jump.
-P-A-G-E-49
  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 41 
89. Running Broad Dive 
A mat should be used for this event. It is carried on as the 
standing broad dive except that the contestant is allowed to run to 
the take-off and leap from one foot, or both feet, as he chooses. 
Stepping over the take-off or failure to execute a forward roll at 
the conclusion of the dive constitutes a trial without record. 
90. Standing High Dive 
A mat, set of jumping stands and a jump stand rope are required 
for this event. (A wooden cross bar should not be used.) A mat 
must be used whether practiced indoors or out. To perform the 
event the contestant stands facing the rope. Then, leaping off 
both feet simultaneously, he dives head foremost over the rope 
landing on his hands on the farther side and completes the move- 
ment by executing a forward roll. To be legal the contestant’s 
feet must not leave the ground preliminary to making the leap; 
no part of his body must touch the rope at any time during the 
dive; and he must land on his hands and make a forward roll at 
the conclusion. Any attempt failing in any of these prescriptions 
constitutes a foul and a trial without record. The rope is raised 
and measurements made as in the standing high jump. 
91. Running High Dive 
This event is carried on as the standing high dive except that 
the contestant runs preliminary to the dive and may leap from one 
foot or from both feet. The rope is raised as in the standing 
high dive. 
KICKING TYPE EVENTS 
92. Standing Stretch Kick * (forward) 
To carry on this event a kicking drum is required. In executing 
the event the contestant, standing close to and facing the drum, 
takes one step forward and kicks the drum with the toe of the 
other foot. To make a valid kick the supporting foot must not 
leave the ground until the kicking foot has returned to it, and the 
contestant must retain his upright position without the aid of the 
hands. Fouls are counted as trials without record. The drum 
is raised in competition as the bar in the high jump.
-P-A-G-E-50
  
42 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
93. Standing Stretch Kick (backward) 
A kicking drum is required for the conduct of this event. To 
execute the event the contestant, standing with his back toward the 
drum, leans slightly forward, and keeping one foot on the floor, 
kicks backward at the drum with the other foot. To make a valid 
kick the supporting foot must not leave the ground until the kicking 
foot has returned to it and the contestant must retain his upright 
position without the aid of the hands. Fouls are counted as trials 
without record. The drum is raised in competition as the bar in 
the high jump. 
94. Standing Double Kick (forward) 
A kicking drum is necessary for the conduct of this event. The 
contestant, with feet together, stands facing the drum. He jumps 
off of both feet and, kicking both forward, kicks the drum with 
both. To make a valid kick the contestant must not raise either 
foot from the ground preliminary to the jump; must kick the drum 
with both feet simultaneously; must not turn in the air; must land 
on his feet (one or both) on the ground; and must maintain the up- 
right position without the aid of the hands. Foul kicks are counted 
as trials without record. The drum is raised during competition 
as the bar in the high jump. 
95. Standing Double Kick (backward) 
A kicking drum is required for the conduct of this event. The 
contestant with feet together stands with his back toward the drum. 
Then jumping off of both feet and swinging both feet backward 
together he kicks the drum with both feet simultaneously. After 
jumping for the purpose of avoiding the drum with his buttocks the 
contestant should hollow his back as much as possible. To make a 
valid kick the contestant must land on his feet (one or both) and 
maintain his upright position without the aid of his hands. Foul 
kicks count as trials without record. The drum is raised in competi- 
tion as the bar in the high jump. 
96. Standing High Kick * 
A kicking drum is required for the conduct of this event. To 
execute the event the contestant stands, with feet together, facing 
the drum. Then, jumping off of both feet simultaneously, he swings
-P-A-G-E-51
  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 43 
one foot upward and kicks the drum with the toe of that foot. To 
make a valid kick the contestant must land on his feet and maintain 
the upright position without the aid of his hands. Foul kicks count 
as trials without record. The drum is raised in competition as the 
bar in the high jump. 
97. Running Scissors Kick * 
To carry on this event a kicking drum is required. To execute 
the event the contestant runs (takes a few steps) and leaping off of 
one foot kicks the drum with the toe of the other foot. To make 
a valid kick the contestant must not turn in the air and must land 
on his feet and remain there without having hands or body touch 
the ground. Foul kicks are counted as trials without record. The 
drum is raised in competition as the bar in the high jump. 
98. Running Hitch Kick * 
A kicking drum is required for the conduct of this event. To 
perform the event the contestant stands a short distance from the 
drum, runs (takes a few steps) and leaping from one foot kicks 
the drum with the same foot. To iliustrate the proper method for 
doing this we have the following; the contestant leaps from the 
right foot at the same time kicking up with the left, then the left 
foot is brought down while the right foot is brought up to kick the 
drum. To make a valid kick the contestant must not turn in the 
air and must land on his feet in the upright position and remain 
there without the use of the hands. Foul kicks are counted as trials 
without record. The drum is raised during competition as the bar 
in the high jump. 
99. Running High Kick (free style) * 
To carry on this event a kicking drum is required. To perform 
the event the contestant runs toward the drum and attempts to kick 
the drum any way he chooses. He may leap off of one foot or both 
feet. The only requirement is that he must land on his feet and 
maintain an upright position without the use of the hands. Any 
attempt in which the contestant touches any part of his body other 
than his feet to the ground constitutes a trial without record. The 
drum is raised as the bar in the high jump. The highest point kicked 
by the contestant represents his record.

44 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
ROPE SKIPPING TYPE EVENTS 
100. 100 Rope Skips (free style) * 
A piece of quarter inch rope about nine feet long is required for 
_ this event. To perform the event the contestant holds one end 
of the rope in each hand with the rope hanging in back of his 
ankles. On the signal “Start” he swings the rope over his head 
and under his féet, jumping each time so the rope will pass under. 
  FIG. 14. STARTING POSITION, ROPE 
JUMPING 
The jumps may be made in any way the contestant chooses. He 
continues this until he has cleared the rope one hundred times. 
Time is taken from the command “‘Start’” until the finish of the 
hundred jumps. (Fig. 14.) ‘ 
101. 100 Rope Skips (single jump) * 
This event is conducted as the free style event except that the 
contestant must keep his feet together and jump over the rope 
with no intermediate jumps. Any leap over the rope made other- 
wise should not be counted.
-P-A-G-E-53
  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 45 
102. 100 Rope Skips (skipping) * 
This event is conducted as the regular free style event except 
that the contestant must actually skip over the rope. The proper 
succession for doing this is as follows: Step on left foot; hop on 
left foot while rope passes under; step on right foot; hop on right 
foot while rope passes under; step on left foot, and so on. 
103. 100 Rope Skips (running) * 
This event is conducted the same as the free style event except 
that the contestant must jump over the rope with the left and right 
foot alternately. In this event the contestant literally “runs in 
place.” The two feet should never touch the ground at the same 
time. 
104. 100 Rope Skips (double jump): * 
This event is conducted the same as the free style event except 
that the contestant must keep his feet together and execute an 
extra jump between jumps over the rope. The method of jump- 
ing is as follows: Jump over rope, jump, jump over rope, jump, 
etc. Only jumps over the rope are counted. Any leap over the rope 
made in other than the prescribed fashion should not be counted. 
105. 100 Rope Skips (backward) * 
This event is conducted the same as the free style event except 
that the contestant starts with the rope in front of his ankles and 
swings it backward over his head and forward under his feet. Any 
method of leaping over the rope may be used. 
106. 50 Rope Skips (one leg) * 
This event is conducted the same as the free style event except 
that the contestant supports himself on one leg throughout the 
attempt. Any contestant touching the raised leg to the floor com- 
mits a foul which is scored as a trial without record. 
107. Half Minute Rope Skip (free style) * 
A piece of quarter inch rope about nine feet long is required for 
this event. To perform the event the contestant holds one end
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
of the rope in each hand with the rope hanging in back of his 
ankles. On the signal “Start” the contestant swings the rope over 
his head and under his feet, jumping each time so the rope will pass 
under. The jumps may be made in any way the contestant chooses. 
The contestant continues to jump over the rope as fast as he can 
until thirty seconds has elapsed. On the expiration of thirty 
seconds, which is taken from the command “‘Start,” the timer calls 
“Stop.” The number of times the contestant jumps over the rope 
during this period represents his record. 
108. Half Minute Rope Skip (single jump) * 
This event is conducted as the free style event except that the 
contestant must keep his feet together and jump over the rope with 
no intermediate jumps. Any leap over the rope made in any other 
manner should not be counted. 
109. Half Minute Rope Skip (skipping) * 
This event is conducted as the regular free style event except 
that the contestant must skip over the rope. The proper method 
for doing this is as follows: Step on left; hop on left foot while 
rope passes under; step on right foot; hop on right foot while rope 
passes under; step on left foot and so on. Any leap over the rope 
made otherwise should not be counted. 
110. Half Minute Rope Skip (running) * 
This event is conducted the same as the free style event except 
that the contestant must jump over the rope with the left and right 
foot alternately. In this event the contestant literally ‘runs in 
place.” The two feet should never touch the ground at the same 
time. Any leap over the rope made otherwise than the prescribed 
manner should not be counted. 
111. Half Minute Rope Skip (double jump) * 
This event is conducted the same as the free style event except 
that the contestant must keep his feet together and execute an extra 
jump between jumps over the rope. The method of jumping is 
as follows: Jump over the rope; jump; jump over the rope; jump; 
etc. Only jumps over the rope are counted. Leaps over the rope 
made in any manner except that prescribed should not be counted.

112. Half Minute Rope Skip (backward) * 
This event is conducted the same as the free style event except 
that the contestant starts with the rope in front of his ankles and 
swings it backward over his head and forward under his feet Any 
method of leaping over the rope may be used. 
113. Half Minute Rope Skip (one leg) * 
This event is conducted the same as the free style event except 
that the contestant supports himself on one leg throughout the at- 
tempt. The contestant cannot change legs after he has started. 
Any contestant touching the raised foot to the floor commits a foul 
which is scored as a trial without record. 
VAULTING TYPE EVENTS 
114. Bar Vault (free style) * 
An adjustable horizontal bar is necessary for this event. To 
perform the event the contestant stands facing the bar, grasps it 
with both hands and vaults over it. To make a legal vault the 
contestant must jump off of both feet simultaneously and clear the 
bar without touching it with any part of the body. The contestant 
must execute a clear vault—handsprings and such are not allowed; 
and the vault must be continuous—in other words the contestant 
cannot come to a halt in any position. ‘‘Crow-hopping,” swing- 
ing, touching the bar with the body or legs, dropping the chin below 
the bar, and halting while executing the vault each constitutes a 
foul and is recorded as a trial without record. The bar is raised 
and the vault is measured as in the high jump. 
115. Bar Vault (one hand) 
This event is conducted the same as the free style bar vault 
except that the contestant uses only one hand on the bar. Fouls 
are recorded, the bar is raised, the height is measured and every- 
thing else is carried on exactly as in the two hands event. 
116. Fence Vault * 
This event is carried on exactly as the bar vault except that the 
contestant is allowed to put one foot on the bar while vaulting. 
“Crow-hopping,” swinging, touching the bar with any part of the
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
body and legs, excepting one foot, and halting while executing the 
vault each constitutes a foul and is recorded as a trial without 
record. The bar is raised and the vault measured as in the 
high jump. . 
117. Straddle Vault for Distance * 
A post from three to four feet high, solidly fixed in the ground, 
or a vaulting buck set at this same height is required for this event. 
To execute the event the contestant takes a position from five to 
fifteen yards in back of the post, runs forward and straddle vaults 
over the post attempting to land as far from the post as possible. 
The point nearest the base of the post touched by the contestant is 
taken as the mark. ‘This distance is measured from the far side 
of the base of the post to the mark. If a buck is used the distance 
is measured from a point on the floor directly beneath the far side 
of the buck to the mark. 
118. Squat Vault for Distance 
A vaulting buck or a gymnasium horse is required for the con- 
duct of this event. Set the buck (or horse) at a height of from 
three to four feet according to the age and ability of the perform- 
ers. To execute the event the contestant takes a position ten or 
fifteen yards in back of the buck, runs forward and squat vaults 
over the buck, attempting to land as far from it as possible. The 
point nearest the buck touched by the contestant is taken as his 
mark. The distance is measured from a point on the floor directly 
beneath the far side of the buck to the mark. 
119. Post Vault for Distance 
A post from three to four feet in height solidly fixed in the 
ground, or a vaulting buck set at the same height is required for 
this event. Establish a line three feet in front of the post— 
measured from the center of the base of the post. To execute 
the vault the contestant runs toward the post, jumps off of both 
feet from behind the line and straddle vaults over the post. Step- 
ping over the take-off line or touching the post with any part of 
the body other than the hands constitutes a trial without record. 
The take-off line is brought back from the post in the same way as 
the bar is raised in the high jump. The distance from the center 
of the base of the post to the line at the time of the contestant’s best 
vault represents his record.
-P-A-G-E-57
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 49 
120. Thief Vault 
A vaulting buck or a vaulting horse without pommels is required 
for the conduct of this meet. Set the buck at a height from three 
to three and a half feet. Establish a take-off line three feet in 
front of the buck, measured from a point on the floor directly 
beneath the center of the buck. To execute the vault the contestant 
runs toward the post, leaps off of one foot from behind the take-off 
line, making as if to jump straight over the buck and then, after 
both feet have cleared it, places both hands on the buck and pushes 
off, landing on his feet on the far side. The take-off line is gradu- 
ally moved away from the horse as the contestants succeed in 
executing the vault. Any attempt in which the contestant touches 
any part of his body, other than his hands, to the horse, constitutes 
a foul and is recorded as a trial without record. Two or three trials 
may be given at each distance. The contestant’s record vault is 
measured from a point on the floor directly beneath the center of 
the buck to the take-off line at the time of this vault. 
121. Straddle Vault for Height 
To conduct this event a vaulting buck and fourteen bricks (wood 
or cement, 2-4-8 inches in size) are necessary. Set the buck at a 
height of four feet, six inches. Place one brick, lying flat on top 
of the buck long axis parallel to the long axis of the buck. To per- 
_form the event the contestant running at right angles to the long 
axis of the buck places both hands on the buck and straddle vaults 
over the buck. A second brick is placed flat on top of the first. 
The contestant vaults over as before. Knocking one or more 
bricks off constitutes a foul and a trial without record. Two or 
three trials should be allowed each contestant at each height. Other 
bricks are added until the contestant fails to clear them. The 
largest number of bricks successfully cleared by the contestant rep- 
resents his score. (Fig. 15.) 
122. Floor Vault * 
This event may be carried on outdoors on the grass or indoors 
ona mat. To execute the event the contestant stands toeing the 
take-off, leaps forward landing on his hands and, with legs apart, 
brings his feet up outside of his hands. The contestant may then 
fall forward on his hands again or rise to the erect position, but 
if he allows any part of his body other than his hands and feet to 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
50 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
touch the floor, the attempt constitutes a foul and a trial without 
record. ‘The point nearest the take-off touched by the contestant 
(by either hands or feet) is established as his mark. The dis- 
tance is measured from the mark to a point on the take-off at right 
angles to the same. 
  FIG. 15, STRADDLE VAULT FOR HEIGHT 
(12 BRICKS) 
123. Pole Vault for Distance 
A spiked vaulting pole is required for this event. This event is 
carried on out of doors. It cannot be carried on satisfactorily 
indoors. A pit is advisable but not absolutely necessary. When a 
pit is used the take-off should be established so the contestant will 
land in the pit at the completion of his vault. The take-off line 
should be six feet long and clearly marked. To perform the event 
the contestant carrying the pole runs to the take-off, places his pole 
in the ground ahead and vaults as far as possible. Stepping over 
the take-off line constitutes a foul and is scored as a trial without 
record. The point nearest the take-off touched by the contestant 
is set as his mark. The distance is measured from the mark to a 
point on the take-off line at right angle to the same.

INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 51 
124. Rope Vault 
An ordinary climbing rope of any length or thickness and a set 
of jumping standards are necessary for the conduct of this event. 
No knots or cross-bars should be used on the rope. The lower 
end of the rope should be not higher than 18 inches from the floor. 
The jumping stands should be so placed that when the bar is at a 
height of five feet the end of the taut rope touches the bar. The 
standards must be left at this spot throughout the contest. To per- 
form the event the contestant grasps the end of the rope as far from 
the bar as he can, runs toward the bar, at the same time taking up 
on the rope; then as he approaches the median line he leaps up 
catching the rope as high as he can, and swings up and over the bar, 
letting go of the rope so he drops on the far side. After jumping 
he may raise the lower hand to a point on the rope just below the 
upper but cannot raise the upper hand. Leaving the ground after 
running toward the bar without attempting to clear the bar con- 
stitutes a trial without record. The bar is raised and the perform- 
ances measured as in the pole vault. 
125. Ring Vault 
A pair of flying rings and a set of jumping stands are necessary 
for the conduct of this event. The ropes should be adjusted so 
that when they are hanging vertical there is not over 6 feet 3 inches 
from the floor to the bottom of the rings. (Note: they may be less 
than six feet and three inches from the ground.) The jumping 
stands should be placed in front of the rings so that when the bar 
is at a height of eight feet the under edge of the rings when 
stretched taut will just touch the top of the bar. Then the stand- 
ards are moved forward away from the rings one foot; this is the 
basic position. In competition-the standards are moved forward 
or backward one inch from this position for each inch the bar is 
raised or lowered from the eight foot height. To perform the 
event the contestant grasps one ring in each hand and moves as far 
away from the bar as he can; then he runs forward, swinging for- 
ward in the air; swings backward, taking one or two steps back- 
ward on the floor; swings backward raising both feet up through 
the rings above his head; swings forward and, letting go of the 
rings, shoots feet foremost over the bar, landing on the far side. 
Taking more than two forward swings and knocking off the bar
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
constitutes a trial without record. The bar is raised as in the 
pole vault. 
CLIMBING TYPE EVENTS 
126. Wall Climb 
A wooden wall eight feet high, eight feet long and twelve inches 
thick is necessary for this event. ‘The sides and top should be com- 
pletely covered and be smooth with no projections of any sort. 
For grade school boys the wall should be six feet six inches high; 
for high school boys it should be seven feet three inches high. In 
both cases the length and thickness should be the same as for adults. 
To perform the event the contestant takes a position hanging at full 
arms’ length on one side. At signal he climbs over the top of the 
wall and vaults off on the opposite side; then he immediately climbs 
back over the wall dropping down on the side from which he 
started. The contestant may scramble over and back in any way 
he chooses; there is no prescribed method. The time is taken from 
the signal “Start” until the contestant’s feet touch the ground on 
the side of starting. 
127. Rope Climb (free style) * 
To carry on this event a two inch rope hanging from a point at 
least eighteen feet from the floor to a point within three feet of the 
floor must be available. The rope should be marked with a tape, 
ribbon or tamborine at a point eighteen feet from the floor— 
this is the marker. To perform the event the contestant stands 
at the bottom of the rope and at the signal “Go” starts climbing 
the rope, climbing in any manner he chooses until he touches the 
marker. He is timed from the signal “Go” until he touches the 
marker. This time is taken as the contestant’s record. (Fig. 16.) 
128. Rope Climb (arms only) 
To carry on this event a two inch rope hanging from a point at 
least eighteen feet from the floor and reaching eighteen inches from 
floor must be provided. The rope should be free of knots, balls, 
bars and other projections that might be an aid in climbing. It 
should also have a tamborine, bell, ribbon, or some similar 
object, placed at a height of 18 feet from the floor—this is the 
marker. To perform the event the contestant sits on the floor
-P-A-G-E-61
  
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 53 
with his legs extended to the front. On the signal “Go,” using his 
arms only, he climbs the rope until he touches the eighteen feet 
marker. The contestant should not touch the floor with his legs, 
feet or knees after the signal to start has been given. The con- 
testant is timed from the signal ‘‘Go”’ until he touches the marker; 
the time which elapses represents his record. (Fig. 17.) 
   FIG, 16, ROPE CLIMB (FREE STYLE) FIG. 17, ROPE CLIMB (HANDS ONLY) 
129. Bar Climb * 
A horizontal bar is necessary for the conduct of this event. The 
bar should be placed at a height of seven feet and nine inches. For 
Senior High School Boys the bar should be seven feet three, and 
Junior High School Boys six feet nine. To perform the event 
the contestant stands on one side of the bar. On the signal ‘‘Start” 
he leaps upward, catches the bar with his hands and, by kipping, 
climbing, or upstarting, rises to a position above the bar and thence 
crosses the bar, dropping off on the far side. Immediately he re- 
peats this process, crossing the bar in the opposite direction, and 
drops off on the starting side. The contestant may scramble over 
the bar and back in any way he chooses; the only restriction is that 
he cannot touch the supporting standards. Attempts in which a 
contestant touches the uprights are scored as trials without record.

HAND TRAVELING TYPE EVENTS 
130. Hang Travel (hand over hand on rungs) * 
To carry on this event a horizontal ladder is necessary. To 
execute the event the contestant assumes the ordinary hang position 
with both hands on a rung at one end of the ladder facing the oppo- 
site end. The contestant must hang perfectly still—there must be 
no swinging. On the signal “Start”? the contestant walks forward 
hand over hand to the last rung upon which he places both hands 
and then he walks backward hand over hand to the first rung from 
which he hangs with both hands. The contestant must hang from 
each rung, both when traveling forward and when traveling back- 
ward. Failure to travel exactly in the prescribed manner and 
‘touching the feet to the floor, each constitutes a foul and is scored 
as a trial without record. The time elapsing from the signal 
“Start” to the moment both hands retouch the first rung represents 
the contestant’s record. 
131. Hang Travel (double jumping on rungs) 
To carry on this event a horizontal ladder is necessary. To 
execute the event the contestant assumes the ordinary hang position 
with both hands on a rung at one end of the ladder facing the oppo- 
site end. The contestant must hang perfectly still—there must be 
no swinging of the body. On the signal “Start” the contestant 
travels forward by jumping both hands simultaneously from rung to 
rung, until he reaches the last rung; then traveling backward in the 
same manner he returns to the first rung. Failure to travel exactly 
in the prescribed manner and touching the feet to the floor, each 
constitutes a foul and a trial without record. The time which 
elapses from the signal “Start”? to the moment both hands return to 
the starting rung represents the contestant’s score. (Fig. 18.) 
132. Hang Travel (walking sideward on rail) * 
To carry on this event a horizontal ladder or a set of inverted 
parallel bars is necessary. To execute the event the contestant 
hangs on the extreme end of one of the rails; the contestant should 
face in, hang with both hands on one bar, touching each other, 
and should not be in motion—he should be “dead.” On the signal
-P-A-G-E-63
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 55 
“Start” the contestant, by moving one hand away and closing the 
other to it, travels sideward to the extreme end of the bar where 
both hands must touch each other, then traveling in the same 
manner the contestant returns to his starting position with both 
hands together. Failure to travel exactly in the prescribed manner 
and touching the feet to the floor constitutes a trial without record. 
The time elapsing from the signal “Start”? to the moment both 
hands return to the starting position represents the contestant’s 
record.

TRAVEL (DOUBLE JUMP ON RUNGS) 
133. Hang Travel (hand over hand on both rails) * 
To carry on this event a horizontal ladder or a set of inverted 
parallel bars is necessary. To execute the event the contestant 
hangs at the extreme end of the apparatus—one hand on each rail, 
facing the opposite end. The contestant’s body should be abso- 
lutely still. On the signal “Start”? the contestant, by swinging the 
arms alternately forward, travels forward until he reaches and 
hangs from the extreme end of the apparatus—one hand on each 
bar. Then, traveling in the same manner, the contestant walks 
backward to the starting position—one hand on each bar. Fail- 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  56 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
ure to travel in exactly the prescribed manner and touching the feet 
to the floor, each constitutes a trial without record. The time 
elapsing from the signal “Start” until the moment both hands re- 
turn to the starting position represent the contestant’s record. 
134. Hang Travel (double jumping on both rails) 
To carry on this event a horizontal ladder or a set of inverted 
parallel bars is necessary. ‘To execute the event the contestant 
hangs at the extreme end of the apparatus—one hand on each rail, 
facing the opposite end. The contestant’s body should be abso- 
lutely still. On the signal “Start” the contestant by jumping both 
hands forward simultaneously travels forward until he reaches and 
hangs from the extreme end of the apparatus. Then traveling in 
the same manner the contestant travels backward to the starting 
position. Failure to travel in the prescribed manner and touching 
the feet to the floor, each constitutes a trial without record. The 
time elapsing from the signal “Start” until the moment both hands 
return to the starting position represents the contestant’s record. 
135. Ring Travel * 
To conduct this event a set of four or more traveling rings are 
necessary. To execute the event the contestant, holding an end 
ring in both hands jumps off an elevated platform and swings and 
catches the next ring. After this he travels back and forth across 
the series of rings in the regular manner without touching the feet 
to the floor. On the end rings he should swing out and back hold- 
ing on with either one or both hands. If at any time the contestant 
touches the floor with his feet he should be halted and his score 
taken from this point. Each ring caught and swung-on counts one 
point. The total number of rings caught and swung-on represents 
the contestant’s record. 
. FAR THROWING TYPE 
136. Baseball Far Throw * 
For the best conduct of this event the ground should be marked 
out according to the following directions. A line fifty feet long 
should be established; this is known as the throwing line. Two 
lines one hundred yards long extending from the extremities of the 
throwing line and at right angles to the same should also be estab- 
"lished; these are the side lines. And, for the purpose of facilitating uo

INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 57 
measuring, other lines running between the side lines and parallel 
to the throwing line should be established in the throwing zone— 
that is where most of the balls will land. These may be five or ten 
yards apart. (Dia. 7.) 
Throwing

DIAGRAM 7 
The regulation baseball should be used for high school boys and 
adults; the junior baseball is better for grade school boys. To per- 
form the event the contestant takes a position behind the throwing 
line and in any way he chooses, standing or running, throws the 
ball as far as he can. The point of ground nearest the throwing 
line broken by the ball is established as the mark. ‘Touching 
ground either on or over the throwing line before the ball hits the 
ground constitutes a foul. Any ball falling outside of the side lines 
is also considered foul. Fouls are counted as trials without record. 
The distance is measured from the mark to the point on the throw- 
ing line at right angles to it. Measuring the intervals between 
the lines is facilitated by using a measuring stick five yards long. 
v 137. Playground Ball Far Throw * ~ 
The regular 14 inch or 12 inch playground ball is used for this 
event. The field, the method of throwing, and the method of con- 
duct is the same as that which is used for the baseball far throw 
outlined before. 
138. Medicine Ball Far Throw (free style) * 
The regular medicine ball throw is a free style throw; the con- 
testant may throw the ball any way he chooses. The six-pound 
ball is best for high school and adult groups; the four-pound ball 
is best suited to fourth, fifth and sixth grades. To conduct this 
event a field should be marked out as follows: A throwing line 
twenty feet in length; two side lines sixty feet long projecting at 
right angles from the ends of the throwing line; and to facilitate 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
58 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
measuring, cross lines at intervals of five feet in the throwing zone 
should be established. The throw is made from behind the line, 
with or without a run, as each individual contestant chooses. The 
point nearest the line touched by the ball is established as the mark. 
The distance is measured from the mark to a point on the throwing 
line at right angles to the same. Touching ground in front of the 
throwing line, throwing the ball so it lands outside of the side lines 
each constitutes a foul. Fouls count as trials without record.

139. Medicine Ball Far Throw (forward) * 
A field like that outlined for the free style throw should be used 
for this event. To execute the throw the contestant stands with 
both feet toeing the throwing line, holds the ball in both hands, 
swings it down between his legs and then throws it forward. The 
contestant may step over the line after the ball has been released. 
Throwing the ball so it lands outside of the side line constitutes a 
foul and a trial without record. The mark is set and the distance 
measured as in the free style throw. (Fig. 19.)

constitutes a foul anda trial without record. The point of ground 
nearest the throwing line touched by the bean bag is established as 
the mark. The distance is measured from the mark to a point on 
the throwing line at right angles to the same. 
bv 148. Basketball Far Throw * é 
The basketball far throw is carried on in the same general man- 
ner as the baseball far throw. If possible a field similar to that 
outlined for the baseball throw should be used. In view of the 
fact that the ball cannot be thrown so far, the cross lines in the 
field should be nearer the throwing line. The contestant may 
throw with or without a run and use any style he chooses. Fouls, 
methods of measuring, and so on are the same as for the baseball 
throw. The regular basketball should be used. 
149. Hurlball Far Throw * 
‘This event is carried on in the same general manner as the base- 
ball far throw. If possible a field like that outlined for the 
baseball throw should be used. To make the throw the contestant 
may or may not run, and may throw the ball in any way he chooses. 
Fouls, methods of measuring, and so on are the same as for the 
baseball throw. The regular 5 pound hurlball should be used. 
150. Weight Far Throw 
To conduct this event any object of approximately the weight 
desired may be used; a stone, block of wood, piece of iron, and so 
on, are all satisfactory. For adults something weighing about 25 
pounds is best, for senior high school boys something about 20 
pounds and for junior high school boys something about 15 pounds. 
A throwing line 10 feet long should be established. Two sides 
lines 20 feet long running out at right angles from the ends of the 
throwing line should also be established. The throw in this case 
may be made in any of the methods outlined for the medicine ball 
—free style, between legs, over head, backward, one arm, or put. 
The event is carried on, fouls are recorded, marks are set and 
distances are measured as in the medicine ball throws.

This event is carried on in the same general manner as the 
baseball far throw. Conditions are most satisfactory when a 
field similar to that outlined for the baseball throw is used. The 
regular empty hand grenade should be used. The contestant may 
or may not run preliminary to the throw and he may throw in any 
way he chooses. Fouls, methods of measuring, and so on are the 
same as for the baseball throw. 
152. Forward Pass for Distance (Rugby) 
This event is conducted in the same general manner as the base- 
ball far throw. A field similar to that outlined for the baseball 
throw, or a regular football field is essential for the best conduct 
of the event. The throw may be made with or without a run and 
in any style the contestant chooses. (The regular spiral pass is 
of course the best method.) The rules governing the baseball 
throw apply to the general conduct of this event also. 
153. Place Kick for Distance (Soccer) * 
A field similar to that outlined for the baseball far throw or a 
regulation rugby football field is essential to the best conduct of 
the event. To execute the event the contestant places the ball on 
the kicking line and then, taking a short run, attempts to kick it as 
far as possible. After the kick the contestant may cross the kicking 
line. The event is otherwise conducted the same as the baseball 
far throw. 
154. Place Kick for Distance (Rugby) * 
A field similar to that outlined for the baseball far throw or a 
regulation football field is essential to the best conduct of this event. 
To execute the event the contestant stands the ball on end on the 
kicking line and then taking a short run attempts to kick it as far as 
possible. After kicking the ball a contestant may cross the kicking 
line. Otherwise, the event is conducted the same as the baseball far 
throw. 
155. Punt for Distance (Soccer) * 
A field similar to that outlined for the baseball far throw or a 
regulation football field is essential to the best conduct of this event.

  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 65 
To execute the event the contestant takes a position behind the kick- 
ing line and, with or without running, drops the ball; booting it 
before it hits the ground, he attempts to kick it as far as possible. 
The contestant must be behind the kicking line at the time the ball 
is kicked. The event is otherwise conducted the same as the base- 
ball far throw. 
156. Punt for Distance (Rugby) * 
A field similar to that outlined for the baseball far throw or a 
regulation football field is essential to the most satisfactory con- 
' duct of this event. To execute the event the contestant takes a 
position behind the kicking line and, with or without a run, drops 
the ball; booting it before it hits the ground, he attempts to kick it 
as far as possible. The contestant must be behind the kicking line 
at the time the ball is kicked. Fouls are scored, the mark is set, 
and the distance is measured the same as in the baseball far throw. 
157. Drop Kick for Distance (Rugby) 
This event is conducted in the same general manner as the foot- 
ball punt for distance. A field marked with parallel distance lines 
greatly facilitates the conduct of the event. To execute the kick 
the contestant holds the ball in his hands and then, either running 
or standing, drops it to the ground and kicks it immediately after 
it touches the ground. 
158. Bounce Kick for Distance (Soccer) * 
To conduct this event most advantageously a field similar to that 
outlined for the baseball throw should be established. To execute 
the kick the contestant stands behind the kicking line, tosses the 
ball in the air so it bounces on the ground behind the kicking line, 
and then attempts to kick it as far as he can. Any kick which 
lands outside of the side lines is considered foul and a trial with- 
out record. The point nearest the line touched by the ball is es- 
tablished as the mark. The distance is measured from the mark 
to a point on the kicking line at right angles to the same. 
159. Fungo Hit for Distance (Baseball) 
A field like that outlined for the conduct of the baseball throw 
is essential to the best conduct of this event. To execute the event, 
the contestant, holding a baseball and bat, stands behind the base d

line, tosses the ball in the air and bats it as far as he can. Touch- 
ing the ground in front of the base line before the ball hits the 
ground, or hitting the ball so it lands outside of the side lines 
counts as a trial without record. The point of ground nearest the 
base line touched by the ball is established as the mark. The 
distance is measured from the mark to a point on the base line 
at direct right angles to it. 
160. Fungo Hit for Distance (Playground Ball) * 
A field like that outlined for the conduct of the baseball throw 
is essential to the best conduct of this event. The event is carried ” 
on in the same way as the baseball fungo hit for distance, with the 
exception that the playground ball is used in place of the baseball. 
Either the 12 inch or 14 inch ball may be used. 
161. Volley Ball Serve for Distance * 
A field like that outlined for the baseball throw should be avail- 
able for the conduct of this event. To execute the throw the con- 
testant stands behind the throwing line, tosses the ball in the air 
and, with either an underhand swing or an overhand swing, bats the 
ball with the open hand as far as he can. (1) Touching the 
ground in front of the throwing line before the ball hits the 
ground, (2) batting the ball so it lands out of bounds, or (3) bat- 
ing the ball with the fist constitutes a foul and a trial without 
record. The point of ground nearest the throwing line touched 
by the ball is established as the mark. The distance is measured 
as in the baseball far throw. 
162. Heading for Distance (Soccer) * 
This event is carried on very satisfactorily on a rugby football 
field. The goal line may be used as the heading line. To execute 
the event the contestant, holding a soccer football, stands behind 
the goal line. Tossing the ball in the air and butting it with his 
head he attempts to drive it as far as possible. The contestant 
may or may not run before heading the ball. He may throw 
the ball to any height he wishes and in any way he wishes. The 
only restrictions placed on the contestant are that he must head 
the ball from behind the line and remain behind it until after his 
mark has been established. Crossing the line while in the act 
of heading the ball, or after heading it, counts as a foul and a trial
-P-A-G-E-75
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 67 
without record. The point of ground nearest the line touched by 
the ball is established as the mark. The distance is measured from 
the mark to a point on the line at right angles to the same. 
163. Driving for Distance * 
Establish a line 10 feet long; this is the driving line. To 
execute the event the contestant places a golf ball on the line and 
using any club that he wishes drives the ball as far as he can. The 
point where the ball stops is established as the mark. The distance 
is measured from the mark to a point on the driving line or its 
extension at right angles to the mark. Measuring is facilitated 
in this event if lines similar to those outlined for the baseball throw 
are established in the driving zone. For adults these lines may be 
100 feet long and 10 yards apart from the 150 yard mark to the 
230 yard mark. Two rows of stakes 50 or 60 feet apart marking 
the 10 yard intervals in the driving zone is also satisfactory. Balls 
which stop outside of this zone may be readily measured by sight- 
ing along the lines. A tape or measuring stick may be used to 
measure the intervals between the lines. 
ACCURACY TYPE EVENTS 
164. Basketball Goal Shoot * 
This event is carried on on the basketball court. To perform. 
the event the contestant stands beneath the basket holding a basket- 
ball. He is given one minute to shoot as many baskets as he can. 
At the signal ‘‘Go” he starts shooting baskets recovering the ball 
as fast as he can and shooting from any point he chooses. On the 
expiration of one minute the signal “Stop” is given. If the ball is 
in the air when the signal “Stop” is given and goes through the 
basket it counts. The number of times the ball has passed through 
the hoop constitutes his record. (Fig. 25.) 
165. Basketball Foul Shoot * 
This event is carried on on a basketball court. The contestant 
stands behind the free throw line and tosses the ball at the basket 
as in foul shooting. In various competitions, five, ten, fifteen, 
twenty, twenty-five, and even as many as a hundred trials have been 
used. Each fair throw going through the basket counts one. The 
total number of successful throws represents the contestant’s score.

inclosing the free throw line and, using a regular chest shot method 
of throw, attempts to shoot the ball into the basket. The contest- 
ant may take one step before shooting and may stand on one or 
both feet at the time of making the shot. He must release the

ball from behind the circle and he must not enter the circle after it 
has been released; failure in this respect constitutes a foul and a 
trial without record\ Five or ten trials are satisfactory for most 
competitions. The total number of successful throws made by a 
contestant represents his score. 
167. Double Trial Basket Shoot * 
This event must be carried on on a basketball court. To execute 
the event the contestant stands behind the circle enclosing the free 
throw line and, using a regular chest shot, attempts to shoot the ball 
through the basket. If the throw succeeds it scores three points and
-P-A-G-E-77
  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 69 
the contestant does not make a second throw. If the throw fails to 
score, however, he attempts to recover the ball before it hits the 
floor or as soon thereafter as possible. Upon recovering the ball 
he attempts to throw it through the basket again. The second throw 
must be made immediately after recovering it. If the ball has 
not touched the floor before making the second shot and the throw 
is successful it scores two points; if it has touched the floor before 
making the shot it scores one point. In either case, if the throw 
fails it scores nothing. In making his first throw the contestant 
must release the ball outside of the circle but may enter the circle 
immediately afterward and make the second throw from any point 
he recovers the ball. The contestant may take one step with the 
ball in making both throws. Five or ten trials is satisfactory for 
most competitions. The total number of points made by a con- 
testant represents his score. 
168. Basketball One Hand Shot * 
This event requires a regulation basketball court for its con- 
duct. To execute the event the contestant, holding a basketball, 
stands on the circle enclosing the free throw line. Then, running 
toward the basket, he bounces the ball on the free throw line, 
catches it in both hands, leaps in the air toward the basket and 
attempts to push the ball into the basket with one hand. Taking 
more than one step with the ball, shooting with both hands run- 
ning in any direction but straight from the front constitutes a foul 
and a trial without record. Five or ten trials are satisfactory for 
most competitions. The total number of successful throws repre- 
sents a contestant’s score. 
169. Basketball Target Throw * 
An Indian club and a basketball are required for this event. 
Stand the club on end on the ground. Establish a throwing line 
three feet long sixty feet from the Indian club. To perform the 
event the contestant stands on the throwing line and throws the 
ball at the Indian club. One foot must be in contact with the 
throwing line at the time the ball is released. Throws knocking 
the club over on the fly count three points, on the first bounce two 
points, after the second bounce one point. Throws failing -to 
knock the club over score nothing. Five or ten trials are good for 
most competitions. The total number of points made by a con- 
testant represents his score.

A wooden target six feet high and six feet wide, with concentric 
circles one foot, two feet, three feet, four feet and five feet in 
diameter arranged in the center, is required for this event. The 
target should be firmly set up with the outside ring one foot off 
the ground. A throwing line three feet long should be established 
ninety feet in front of the target. To perform the event the con- 
testant stands on the throwing line and flings the ball at the target; 
one foot must be in contact with the throwing line at the time the 
ball is released. Five or ten throws is a good number for most 
competitions. The circles score 5-4-3-2-1 counting from the center 
outward. Throws going outside of the largest circle score nothing. 
Throws hitting on the line between two zones score for the inside 
zone. The total number of points made by a contestant represents 
his score. (Dia. 9.)

171. Baseball Pitch * 
To conduct this event it is necessary to have a pitching target. 
The pitching target is constructed as follows. Hang two pieces of 
canvas about 8 feet square, one about 12 inches in front of the 
other. The bottom of the canvas should touch the floor. Cut a 
hole in the center of the front canvas 18 inches wide and 36 inches 
high; the bottom of this hole should be 20 inches from the floor. 
Reénforce the hole so it will not tear; a wire frame on the inside 
combined with an extra piece of canvas makes a very satisfactory 
arrangement. This hole represents the space over the baseball 
plate in which a ball must pass to be called a strike. Establish a 
line 60 feet from the front canvas; this is the pitcher’s box. 
To perform the event the contestant stands on the throwing line 
and flings the ball at the target; one foot must be in contact with 
the throwing line at the time the ball is released. The throw must 
be made with a regular overhand pitch and not tossed under- 
hand. Five or ten throws is a good number for most competitions. 
Each ball going through the hole scores one point. The total points 
made by a contestant represents his score. (Dia. 10.) 
172. Catcher’s Throw for Accuracy 
This event is best carried on on a regular baseball diamond. An 
empty barrel open at one end is required. Place the barrel on 
its side on second base with the open end facing toward home base. 
To execute the event the contestant, holding a regular baseball, 
stands on the home plate and attempts to throw the ball so it will 
go in the open end of the barrel; one foot must be in contact with 
the home base at the time the ball is released. Five or ten throws 
is satisfactory for most competitions. Balls landing in the barrel 
on the fly score three points; balls landing inside after the first 
bounce score two points; balls landing inside after. the second 
bounce or on the roll, or in anyway hit the barrel without going in- 
side, score one point; and balls failing to land in the barrel, or 
touch, score nothing. The total number of points scored by the 
contestant represents his record.

line and pitches the ball at the target; one foot must be in contact 
with the throwing line at the time the ball is released. The pitch 
must be made with an underhand swing and not thrown otherwise. 
Five or ten throws is good for most competitions. Each ball going 
through the hole scores one point. The total number of points 
made by a contestant represents his score. (Dia. 10.) 
174. Hurl Ball Target Throw * 
Establish a target 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, and a throw- 
ing line 15 feet long and parallel to the long side of the 
target. The throwing line should be an average throwing distance 
from the target for the group competing. To execute the event 
the contestant, holding the hurl ball stands behind the throwing 
line and attempts to throw the ball so it lands in the target. 
Throws landing in the target score one point; throws failing to

  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 73 
land in the target score nothing. The throws are judged according 
to where they first strike the ground. Five or ten throws are 
satisfactory for most competitions. The total number of points 
made by a contestant represents his score. The regular 5 pound 
hurl ball should be used. 
175. Grenade Throw for Accuracy (circle target) 
To conduct this event it is necessary to establish a target con- 
sisting of three concentric circles 5 feet, 10 feet and 15 feet 
in diameter, respectively, and a throwing line 10 feet long 100 
feet from the center of the target. To perform the event the 
contestant, holding a hand grenade, stands on the throwing line and 
flings the grenade at the target; one foot must be in contact with 
the throwing line at the time the grenade is released. The throw 
must be made with an overhand pitch or an overhand swing. It 
cannot be thrown underhand. Five or ten throws is a good number 
for most competitions. Each throw scores according to where the 
grenade first touches the ground. The center zone scores three 
points, the intermediate zone scores two points and the outside zone 
scores one point. Throws landing outside of the target score 
nothing. ‘Throws landing on the dividing line score for the inside 
zone. The total number of points made by a contestant represents 
his score. (Dia. 11.) 
176. Grenade Throw for Accuracy (trench target) 
To conduct this event it is necessary to establish a target con- 
sisting of six parallel lines 30 feet long at intervals of 5 feet 
and a throwing line 10 feet long, parallel to and 100 feet from the 
center of the target. To execute the event the contestant, holding 
a hand grenade, stands on the throwing line and flings the grenade 
at the target; one foot must be on the throwing line at the time the 
grenade is released. Five or ten throws is a good number for most 
competitions. The grenade scores according to where it first 
touches the ground. The center zone scores three points, the two 
intermediate zones each score two points and the two outside zones 
each score one point. Throws landing outside of the target, either 
at the ends, in front or behind, score nothing. Throws landing on 
the lines between zones score for the higher value zones. Throws 
landing on the boundary lines score for the zones adjacent to the 
point of touching. The total number of points made by a con- 
testant represents his score. (Dia. 12.)

178. Field Hockey Goal Shoot * 
This event is carried on on a hockey field. Establish a hitting 
line 15 yards in front of the center of the goal. Place the 
hockey ball on the ground any place behind the hitting line. To 
execute the event the contestant, holding a stick in his hands, stands 
near the ball, dribbles the ball about in back of the hitting line, and 
then while it is still rolling, attempts to hit it with the stick so it 
goes through the goal. The contestant may dribble the ball in any 
way and in any direction and as often as he desires before making 
the final hit. Failure to hit the ball from behind the hitting line, 
and hitting the ball after it has stopped rolling, constitute fouls and 
are recorded as unsuccessful trials. Balls which fail to go through 
the goal score nothing. Balls which go through the goal score one 
point. Five or ten trials are satisfactory for most competitions. 
The total number of points made by a contestant is taken as his 
score. 
179. Football Target Throw (Rugby) 
A target similar to that used for the baseball target throw is 
necessary for the conduct of this event. A throwing line 3 feet 
long should be established 50 feet from the target. To execute 
the event the contestant stands on the throwing line and flings the 
ball at the target; one foot must be in contact with the line at the 
time the ball is released. Five or ten throws is good for most 
competitions. Throws are scored as in the baseball target throw- 
ing event. The total number of points made by a contestant is 
taken as his score. 
180. Forward Pass for Accuracy (Rugby) 
A rugby football goal is required for the conduct of this event. 
Establish a target by hanging two ropes to feet long from the 
cross bar so they hang 6 feet inside of the two goal posts; this 
gives us three zones 10 feet high and 6 feet wide inside of the

For this event horseshoes and a stake rising 3 inches above 
the ground are necessary. Establish a throwing line 42 feet 
from the stake. To perform this event the contestant stands on 
the throwing line and tosses the horseshoe at the stake attempting 
to ring it. One foot must be on the throwing line at the time the 
shoe is released. Ten throws is satisfactory for most competitions. 
Each “ringer” scores five points, each “leaner” three points, each 
“toucher” two points, and each shoe stopping within one foot of 
the stake scores one point. Shoes stopping more than a foot from 
the stake score nothing. The total number of points made by 
each contestant constitutes his score. 
182. Bean Bag Board Toss * 
To carry on this event it is necessary to have bean bags and a 
bean bag board. The board may be of any dimensions but the 
following are recommended. Board 24 inches square, holes 5 
inches in diameter, holes arranged according to the following dia- 
gram, outside holes five inches from the center hole. Set the board 
against some object so it rests at an angle of 45 degrees from the 
perpendicular. Establish a line three feet long ten feet from the 
board—this is the throwing line. To execute the event the con- 
testant stands behind the throwing line and tosses the bags at the 
holes in the board attempting to make the highest possible score. 
Each bag going through a hole scores the number of points reg- 
istered for that particular hole. Bags which fail to go through a 
hole score nothing. The total points scored by the contestant rep- 
resents his record. Five or ten throws is satisfactory for most 
competitions. The event may be varied by placing the throwing 
line farther from the board—12 feet, 15 feet, and soon. (Dia. 14.) 
183. Bean Bag Target Toss * 
Bean bags and a floor target are necessary for the conduct of this 
event. The floor target is made by describing five concentric circles 
on the floor with chalk—the circles being one foot, two feet, three 
feet, four feet, and five feet in diameter. Establish a line twenty 
feet from the center of the target—this is the throwing line. To 
execute the event the contestant stands behind the throwing line and

tosses the bags at the target attempting to lodge each in the center 
circle or as near it as possible. Each throw is scored according to 
the position in which the bag rests. The several areas counting 
from the center outward score 5, 4, 3, 2, and i respectively. Bags 
resting on a line score for the inside area. Bags resting outside of 
the target score nothing. ‘The total points scored by a contestant 
represents his record. The contestants may be given five or ten 
throws. The event may be varied by placing the throwing line 
farther from the target—twenty-five feet, thirty feet, and so on.

the soccer football on the line. ‘To execute the event the contestant 
stands behind the ball and, with or without a run, attempts to kick 
the ball through the goal. Five or ten kicks is satisfactory for 
most competitions. Balls going through the goal on the fly score 
three points; balls going through on the first bounce score two 
points; balls going through after the second bounce and on the roll 
score one point. Balls which fail to go through the goal score 
nothing. The total points made by a contestant represents his

185. Dribble Kick for Accuracy (Soccer) * 
This event is carried on on a soccer football field. Establish a 
kicking line thirty yards from the center of the goal. To execute 
the event the contestant places the ball on the ground behind the
-P-A-G-E-88
  80 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
kicking line, dribbles the ball on the ground behind the line, and 
while it is still rolling, attempts to kick it through the goal. (Drib- 
bling consists of tapping the ball along the ground with the foot.) 
Five or ten kicks is satisfactory for most competitions. Balls going 
through the goal on the fly score three points; balls going through 
on the first bounce score two points, balls going through after the 
second bounce or on the roll score one point; and balls failing to go 
through the goal score nothing. Failure to kick the ball from be- 
hind the kicking line, or failure to kick it while it is still rolling, con- 
stitutes a foul and a trial without record. The contestant may 
dribble the ball as often as he wishes, and in any direction he wishes, 
so long as he kicks it while it is in motion behind the kicking line. 
The total number of points made by the contestant represents his 
score. 
186. Cerner Kick for Accuracy (Soccer) * 
This event should be carried on on a soccer football field. Es- 
tablish a target on the ground five yards wide and eight yards long 
directly in front of the goal. This area runs from goal post 
to goal post and extends five yards into the field. To execute the 
event the contestant places a soccer football in the corner of the 
field and, with or without a run, attempts to kick it so it will land 
within the target. Five or ten kicks is satisfactory for most 
competitions. Each kick is judged according to where it first hits 
the ground. Balls landing in the target score one point; balls 
landing outside the target score nothing. The total number of 
points made by a contestant represents his score. 
187. Place Kick for Accuracy (Rugby) 
A rugby football goal is necessary for the conduct of this event. 
Establish a line thirty yards from the goal—this is the kicking line. 
To execute the event the contestant stands the ball on end on the 
kicking line; then, taking a short run, attempts to kick the ball over 
the cross bar. Five or ten kicks is satisfactory for most competi- 
tions. Balls going above the cross bar whether inside of the up- - 
rights or above them score one point. Balls going under the cross 
bar or outside of them score nothing. ‘The total number of goals 
made by a contestant represents his score. 
188. Drop Kick for Accuracy (Rugby) 
A rugby football goal is necessary for the conduct of this event. 
Establish a kicking line 25 yards from the goal. To execute

Se ee 
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 81 
the event the contestant, holding a rugby football, stands behind 
the kicking line and, with or without a run, attempts to drop-kick 
the ball over the cross bar. Five or ten kicks is satisfactory for 
most competitions. Balls which go over the cross bar whether 
inside of the uprights or above them score one point. Balls going 
under the cross bar or outside of the uprights score nothing. The 
total number of points made by a contestant represents his score. 
189. Heading for Accuracy (Soccer) * 
A soccer goal or rugby goal is necessary for the conduct. of this 
event. Establish a line ten yards from the goal and parallel to it. 
To execute the event che contestant stands in back of the line, 
tosses a soccer football in the air and butting it with his head 
attempts to head it through the goal. The contestant may run or 
stand still and may toss the ball as high as he wishes while in the 
act of heading it. The only restriction is that he must remain 
back of the line while in the act and after heading the ball. Cross- 
ing the line counts as a foul and is scored as a trial without record. 
Five or ten trials is satisfactory for most competitions. Balls 
going through the goal on the fly score two points, balls going 
through on the bounce or roll score one point, and balls failing to 
go through score nothing. The total number of points made by a 
contestant represents his score. 
190. Clock Golf * 
To carry on this event a clock golf course is necessary. A 
clock golf course may be constructed on any fairly level piece of 
ground. Grass is the best surface, but if this is not available, dirt 
is quite satisfactory. The surface should be free of pebbles, lumps 
of dirt, and so on, so there will be no interference with the normal 
progress of the ball. To establish the course lay out twelve holes 
four inches in diameter, approximately equidistant apart, in a circle 
about 40 feet in diameter. On the playground tomato cans, open at 
one end with a few nail holes in the bottom to let the water drain 
out, may be sunk flush with the ground for holes. The holes are 
numbered as indicated in the attached diagram. To perform the 
event the contestant places his ball within a foot of hole number 
two and putts for hole number one. After the ball has been sunk 
in hole number one it is placed within a foot of hole number one 
and putt for hole number two. Thus the ball is putt into all twelve

191. Golf Putt * 
Out of doors this event may be carried on on a putting green 
or a clock golf court. Indoors it requires an indoor putting court. 
An indoor putting green may be constructed by making a solid 
platform about sixteen feet square and four inches high with a 
round hole four inches in diameter in the center and then covering 
the platform with carpet. If possible, of course, the hole may be 
cut in the floor and the floor covered with a carpet. When this is 
done, the carpet may be taken up and the hole may be closed with a 
wooden plug when the court is not in use. This is a very satisfac- 
tory arrangement, being both economical and practical. To execute
-P-A-G-E-91
  
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 83 
the event the contestant places a golf ball six feet from the hole and 
attempts to putt it in the hole. From five to ten putts is satisfactory 
for most competitions. Each ball that lands in the hole scores one 
point; balls which fail to go in the hole score nothing. The total 
number of points made by a contestant represents his score. 
192. Approach for Accuracy * 
This event may be carried on on a regular green or it may be 
carried on on the playground. If carried on on a golf green 
place a pin about ten inches long in the ground beside the cup. Tie 
a string about forty feet long to the pin. Tie ribbons on the string 
at distances of ten, twenty and thirty feet from the pin. Establish 
a line ten feet long one hundred feet from the hole; this is the 
driving line. 
To execute the event the contestant places a golf ball on the 
driving line and attempts to drive it so it will stop in the hole. 
Five or ten approaches are satisfactory for most competitions. 
The contestant makes all of his shots, letting the balls lie where 
they stop. When he has finished, take the end of the string, draw 
it taut and measure the balls one at a time. As each ball is meas- 
ured pick it up. Balls lying in the hole score ten points, those 
lying within ten feet of the hole score five points, those lying be- 
tween ten and twenty feet of the hole score three points, those 
lying between twenty and thirty feet of the hole score one point, and 
those lying more than thirty feet from the hole score nothing. 
The total number of points made by a contestant represents his 
score. 
On the playground a tin can can be sunk and three concentric 
circles ten, twenty and thirty feet in diameter scratched on the 
ground for the target. The event is otherwise carried on the 
same way. f 
193. Approach Over a Hazard for Accuracy * 
This event is carried on in the same general way as the straight 
approach for accuracy with the following exceptions: The approach 
is made from a shorter distance, fifty or sixty feet being very 
satisfactory. A hazard, such as a fence, a bunker, a bush or some 
similar object from three to six feet high is required. The ball 
should be placed from four to ten feet away from the hazard. 
By using a hazard in this way the contestants are compelled to lift 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
their shots. Five or ten trials may be used. The target and method 
of measuring outlined for the regular event suffice here. 
194. Volley Ball Serve for Accuracy * 
This event is carried on on a volley ball court. Place the net 
at the standard height of eight feet. Establish a target consisting 
of two concentric squares ten and twenty feet square respectively 
in the center of one court. To execute the event the contestant 
stands behind the end line of the opposite court and attempts to 
serve the ball across the net so it will hit in the opposite court. Five 
or ten serves is satisfactory for most competitions. Each service 
is scored according to where it first hits the floor. Balls hitting 
i Sa 
    
DIAGRAM 17
-P-A-G-E-93
  
  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 85 
within the center square score three points; balls hitting inside of 
the second square score two points; balls hitting inside of the court 
but outside of the second square score one point; balls going under 
or hitting the net or going out of bounds score nothing. The 
contestant’s. total points represent his score. (Dia. 17.) 
195. Tennis Wall Serve * 
To conduct this event it is necessary to make a target on a wall 
thirteen and one-half feet long and thirty-six inches wide three feet 
from the floor with two lines across the target dividing it into 
zones one foot wide. Establish a line thirteen and one-half feet 
long thirty-nine feet from the target and directly in front of it; this 
is the serving line. To perform the event the contestant, with a 
tennis racket and a tennis ball, stands behind the serving line and, 
using a regular tennis serve, attempts to hit the target; both feet 
must be behind the serving line at the time the ball is hit. Five 
or ten services is a good number for most competitions. The zones 
scoring from the bottom upward score 3-2-1. Balls hitting outside 
of the target score nothing. Balls hitting on the lines between spaces 
score for the lower space. Balls hitting the lines at the top or 
sides of the target score for the space adjacent to the point of 
hitting. The total points made by a contestant in all of his serves 
represents his score. (Dia. 18.) 
DIAGRAM 18

196. Tennis Court Serve * 
To conduct this event a regulation tennis court with an erected 
net is necessary. The court should be rectangular in shape, seventy- 
eight feet long and twenty-seven feet wide. The net should be 
erected across the court on the midline of its long axis. Eighteen 
feet from each base line there should be a parallel line across the 
court; the area enclosed is called the back court. Another line 
should be drawn down the center of the court from the center of 
one back court line to the other. Thus there are created four 
service courts (two on each side of the net) each thirteen and one- 
half by twenty-one feet in size. 
To perform the event the contestant stands behind the base line 
at one side of the court, tosses the ball in the air and using an over- 
head stroke attempts to hit the ball so it lands in the service court 
diagonally opposite the point of serving. Both feet must be behind 
the base line and in contact with the ground at the time the ball 
is hit. Balls hitting inside of the proper service court or on 
the lines surrounding it score one point. Balls hitting outside of 
the proper service court score nothing. Balls hitting the top of 
the net and falling into the proper court score nothing but may 
be served over. Five or ten services is a good number for most 
competitions. It is best to require that half be made from each 
side of the court. 
STRENGTH TYPE EVENTS 
197. Pull-ups * 
To carry on this event a wooden or steel bar at least three feet 
in length and one inch in diameter, and placed so high that while 
the contestant is hanging from the bar his feet will clear the floor, 
is necessary. To perform the event the contestant starts in the 
hanging position (palms to the front and arms fully extended). 
The contestant then pulls himself up until the under part of his 
chin touches the bar or goes above it, and immediately drops down 
again until his arms are fully extended. He continues this until 
forced to stop. The total number of times the contestant’s chin 
touches the bar represents his score. Kicking and swinging should 
not be allowed—there must be a straight pull with the feet held 
together. Quarter, half and three-quarter pull-ups should not be 
recorded. Any time a contestant fails to place his chin above the

or halts in any position longer than a second he should be stopped 
and his score taken from that point. (Fig. 26.) 
198. Push-ups 
A set of parallel bars is necessary for this event. The bars 
should be arranged eighteen inches apart and at least five feet 
high. To perform the event the contestant takes the cross sup- 
port position on the bars—resting with one hand on each bar, 
  FIG. 26, PULL-UPS FIG, 27. LOWER POSITION IN PUSH-UPS 
elbows straight, legs hanging and feet together. Then he bends 
his elbows to the fullest extent. Then he straightens his elbows, 
thus raising his body. He continues this until forced to stop. Par- 
tial push-ups should not be recorded. The contestant should not 
swing, kick, or separate his feet; there must be a straight push-up, 
with the body and legs hanging in their normal position. Any 
contestant failing to bend his elbows to the limit, failing to 
straighten his elbows fully, swinging, kicking, failing to hold his 
feet together, or stopping in any position longer than one second 
should be stopped and his record taken from that point. (Fig. 27.)

199. Floor Dips * 
The contestant lies face down on the floor, legs extended, feet 
together, and hands resting on the floor under the shoulders. The 
contestant then, lifting his body off the floor, straightens-his elbows 
and drops down again till his chin (and only his chin) touches the 
floor. He continues until forced to stop. The total number of 
push-ups represents his score. Quarter, half and three-quarter 
push-ups should not be recorded. Any time a contestant fails to

any part of his body except his chin, hands and toes to the floor, 
or stops in any position longer than one second, he should be halted 
and his score taken at that point. (Fig. 28.) 
200. Squat and Dip * 
The contestant assumes a squatting position on the floor—feet 
together, knees bent, arms between the knees, hands resting on the 
floor. To execute the event the contestant jumps his feet back- 
ward to a front support position—feet together, body and legs

in line—bends his elbows until his chin (and only his chin) touches 
the floor, straightens his elbows, and jumps back to the starting 
position. The contestant should go through the exercise without 
halting longer than a second in any position. He continues this 
until forced to stop. The total number of times the contestant 
fully executes the event represents his score. Partial execution of 
the event should not be recorded. Any time the contestant fails 
to execute the event exactly as prescribed he should be halted and 
his score taken from that point. (Fig. 29.) 
  FIG. 29. STARTING POSITION, SQUAT AND 
201. Stand, Squat and Dip * 
The contestant assumes the normal standing position. To exe- 
cute the event the contestant goes through the following move- 
ments: (1) squat and place the hands on the floor, arms inside of 
the knees; (2) jump the feet backward to a front support position, 
feet together, body and legs in line; (3) bend the elbows until the 
chin (and only the chin) touches the floor; (4) straighten the 
elbows; (5) jump the feet to the squatting position; (6) and rise 
to the standing position. The contestant should go through the 
event without halting longer than a second in any position. He

continues this until forced to stop. The total number of times the 
contestant fully executes the event represents his score. Partial 
executions should not be recorded. Any time the contestant fails 
to execute the event exactly as prescribed he should be halted and 
his score taken from that point. 
202. Leg Lifts * 
The contestant lies flat on his back on the floor—legs together 
and extended, hands placed palm down on the floor under the hips. 
To perform the event the contestant, keeping his legs together and

knees stiff, raises his feet until they reach an angle of 90 degrees 
or more from their original position and then lowers them to a 
point within 2 or 3 inches from the floor. He continues this 
until forced to stop. The total number of times he raises his legs 
to the vertical position represents his score. Partial lifts should 
not be recorded. Any time the contestant fails to raise his legs 
to the vertical position, touches his feet on the floor, fails to bring 
them within an inch or two of the floor, separates his legs, or 
bends his knees, he should be halted and his score taken from that 
point. (Fig. 30.)

  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 91 
203. Trunk Lifts * 
The contestant sits on the floor with his feet firmly fixed under 
a bar 4 or § inches off the floor. The bottom rung of a stall 
bar works very satisfactory. Or if nothing of this sort is available 
the feet may be held by a second person. The contestant folds 
his arms on his chest. To execute the event the contestant drops 
backward to a full lying position with his head touching the floor 
and then rises to the sitting position. The arms must be kept 
folded on the chest throughout the event. He continues this until 
forced to stop. The total number of times he rises to a full sitting Se

Any time the contestant fails to touch his head to the floor, fails 
to rise to a full sitting position or stops longer than a second in 
any position, he is stopped and his score is taken at that point. 
(Figs. 31-32.) 
204. Sit-ups * 
The contestant sits on the floor with his feet firmly fixed under 
a bar or rope. The bottom rung of a stall bar is good for this 
purpose. Or if apparatus of this sort is not available the feet may 
be held down by another person. The contestant clasps his hands 
‘behind his neck. To perform the event the contestant leans back- 
ward until his head (and only his head) touches the floor. He

then rises to the sitting position. The performer’s back from hips 
to head must be held away from the floor throughout the perform- 
ance. He continues this until forced to stop. The total number 
of times he rises to a full sitting position represents his score. 
Partial sit-ups should not be recorded. Any time the contestant 
fails to touch his head to the floor, fails to rise to a full sitting 
position, touches his back to the floor, takes his hands from in back 
of his head, or stops more than a second in any position, he should 
be stopped and his score taken at that point. (Fig. 31-33.) 
  FIG. 33. LOWER POSITION IN PULL-UPS 
205. Curl-ups 
To carry on this event a wooden or steel bar at least 3 feet 
in length and 1 inch in diameter, and so high that while the con- 
testant is hanging from it his feet will clear the floor, is necessary. 
To perform the event the contestant assumes an ordinary hanging 
position (knuckles pointing backward, arms fully extended, body 
and legs hanging down). The contestant then bends his knees and 
lifts his legs upward until the insteps of both feet touch the bar 
and then lowers them to the starting position. He continues this 
until forced to stop. The feet should be held together throughout

the attempt and there should be no swinging or jerking—the at- 
tempt should be a steady curling-up and uncurling. Any time a 
contestant fails to touch his feet to the bar, fully return to the 
hanging position, halts in a position longer than a second, or starts 
swinging, he should be stopped and his record taken from that point. 
Partial curl-ups should not be recorded. The total number of 
times the contestant executes the curl-up properly represents his 
score. (Fig. 34.) 
  FIG. 34. CURL-UPS 
206. Hanging Hinge * 
To carry on this event a bar similar to a horizontal bar is neces- 
sary. The bar should be at the height so that when the contestant 
is hanging from it his feet will clear the floor. To perform the 
event the contestant takes a hanging position—palms to front, feet 
together and body still. Then, keeping his knees stiff and feet to- 
gether, he raises his legs forward till they reach an angle of 90 
degrees or more from their original position, and then lowers them 
to their starting position. The whole movement should be slow 
and steady; there should be no swinging; and the contestant should 
pause momentarily at each end of the movement, that is, in both 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  94 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
the raised and lowered positions. He continues this until forced 
to stop. The total number of times the contestant raises his legs 
to the proper angle constitutes his record. Partial lifts should 
not be recorded. Any contestant swinging, failing to stop 
momentarily in the end positions, stopping more than two seconds 
‘in any position, failing to raise his legs to an angle of go degrees, 
or failing to hold his feet together and knees straight should be 
halted and his record taken from that point. 
207. Support Hinge 
To carry on this event a set of parallel bars are required. The 
bars should be 18 inches apart and at least 4 feet high. 
To perform the event the contestant takes a cross support position 
on the bars—resting with one hand on each bar, elbows straight, 
legs hanging and feet together. Then, keeping his knees stiff, he 
raises his legs forward until they reach an angle of 90 degrees 
or more from their original position. Then he lowers them to 
the starting position. The whole movement should be slow and 
steady; there should be no swinging; and both the raised and 
lowered position should be held momentarily. He continues this 
until forced to stop. The total number of times the contestant 
succeeds in completing this represents his score. Partial lifts 
should not be recorded. Any contestant swinging, failing to stop 
momentarily in the end positions, failing to raise his legs to an 
angle of 90 degrees, or holding any position longer than two 
seconds, should be stopped and his record taken from that point. 
(Fig. 35.) 
208. Knee Raise * 
To carry on this event a bar similar to a horizontal bar is neces- sary. The bar should be at a height so that when the contestant is hanging from it his feet will clear the floor. To perform the event the contestant takes a hanging position—palms to the front, feet together, and body still. He then raises his knees until the thighs reach an angle of 90 degrees or more from their original position. Then he lowers them to the starting position. The whole movement should be slow and steady; there should be no swinging; and the contestant should 
end of each movement—that is, in b 
positions. He continues this until for pause momentarily at the 
oth the raised and lowered

who swings, fails to stop momentarily in the end positions, stops 
more than two seconds in any position, or fails to raise his knees 
to the proper angle should be halted and his record taken from 
that point. The total number of times the contestant raises his 
knees properly constitutes his score. Partial lifts should not. be 
recorded. 
209. Hanging Half Lever 
A horizontal bar or something similar is necessary for the con- 
duct of this event. The bar should be at least 4 feet from the

ground. To perform the event the contestant takes the regular 
hanging position on the bar—palms to front, arms straight—and, 
keeping his feet together and knees straight, raises his legs forward 
to an angle of 90 degrees. At this point two assistants hold a 
stick under his ankles and the contestant raises his ankles from 
the stick and holds them above it as long as he can. Time is taken 
from the signal ‘‘Go” until the ankles touch the stick again. The 
amount of time which elapses between represents the contestant’s 
score.

210. Support Half Lever 
Two bricks constitute the equipment necessary for the conduct 
of this event. To perform the event the contestant sits on the 
ground holding one brick in each hand and places the bricks on 
the ground beside his hips. The 2x 8 side of the brick is 
placed down; thus the palms of his hands rest 4 inches off the 
ground. At signal the contestant, keeping his knees stiff and 
feet together, raises his buttocks and legs.from the floor and holds 
  FIG. 36. SUPPORT HALF LEVER 
them in this manner as long as he can. Time is taken from the 
signal “Start” until the contestant touches the floor again with 
either buttocks or feet. The time elapsing during this interval 
represents his record. (Fig. 36.) 
211. Knee-taps * 
To perform this event the contestant stands on one leg, grasps 
the foot of the other leg with either hand and holds it behind his 
buttock. Then he bends the knee of the supporting leg until the 
knee of the other leg touches the floor. Then he straightens the
-P-A-G-E-105
  
  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 97 
knee of the supporting leg. He continues this until forced to stop. 
The total number of times he rises to a straight leg position repre- 
sents his score. Partial squats are not scored. Any time the 
contestant fails to touch his knee to the floor, fails to straighten 
his supporting leg, hops on the supporting foot, fails to maintain 
his balance, touches the floor with either hand, stops more than 
a second in any position he should be halted and his score taken at 
that point. The contestant may wiggle his supporting foot along 
the floor but may not hop on it. (Fig. 37.) 
  FIG. 37. KNEE DIP 
212. One Leg Squat * 
The contestant stands on one leg with the other raised forward. 
To perform the event he bends the knee of the supporting leg until 
he is sitting on his heel or has dropped as far as he possibly can, 
and then he straightens the knee, keeping the raised foot off 
the floor, throughout the effort. He continues this until forced to 
stop. The total number of times he raises to a full standing position 
represents his score. Quarter, half and three-quarter squats should 
not be scored. Any time the contestant fails to bend the knee of 
his supporting leg fully, fails to straighten it fully, touches the 
raised foot to the floor, hops on his supporting foot, fails to main-
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
tain his balance, touches the floor with either hand, or stops more 
than a second in any position he should be halted and his score 
_ taken from that point. The contestant may wiggle his supporting 
foot along the floor but may not hop on it. 
213. Grip * 
A hand dynamometer is necessary for the conduct of this event. 
To execute the event the contestant holds the dynamometer in 
either hand and attempts to squeeze the two sides as near together 
as possible. The point on the scales at which the indicator is 
directed after the effort, is taken as the contestant’s record. Care 
should be taken that the indicator is placed so that at the time of 
gripping there is no interference with the normal movement of 
the pointer. 
214. Weight Lifts 
For this event a bar-bell is necessary. While other weights 
may be used a 60-pound ball is best for adults, a 45-pound 
bell for high school boys and a 30-pound bell for grade school 
boys. To perform the event the contestant places the bar in front 
of his feet and reaches down and grasps it with both hands. Then 
straightening his body he raises the bell overhead until his elbows 
are straight. To complete the event he lets the bar down again 
until it hangs 2 or 3 inches from the floor just in front of his 
ankles. He continues this until forced to stop. The total number 
of times the contestant raises the bar overhead represents his score. 
In raising and lowering the bar it must be kept parallel with the 
floor and must not touch the body or floor. Only full lifts are 
recorded. Any time a contestant fails to straighten his elbows 
with the bar overhead, touches the floor with any part of the bar- 
bell, fails to lower the bar within six inches of the floor, holds the 
bar so it is not parallel with the floor, lets the bar touch his body, 
or holds any position longer than a second he should be stopped 
and his score taken from that point. 
215. One Arm Overhead Lifts 
Iron dumb-bells are best for this event, but if they are not avail- 
able any object of approximately the weight suggested below will 
do. For adults the dumb-bell should weigh 40 pounds, for 
high school boys 30 pounds, for grade school boys 20 pounds. 
To perform the event the contestant places the dumb-bell in 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  
  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 99 
one hand and holds it at the shoulder, then he pushes it up 
until the elbow is straight and returns it to the starting position. 
He continues this until forced to stop. The total number of times 
the contestant repeats this constitutes his score. The feet must 
be kept in place, the knees kept straight and the body kept erect 
during the entire performance. Partial push-ups are not recorded. 
Any time a contestant fails to straighten his elbow, fails to return 
to the starting position, moves his feet, lowers his body by either 
bending his knees or bending his trunk, or holds any position for 
longer than one second, he should be stopped and his score taken 
at that point. 
MISCELLANEOUS EVENTS 
216. Running High Touch * 
A Hitch Kick is essential to the best conduct of this event. 
To execute the event the contestant stands beneath the drum and 
with or without a run leaps off both feet and attempts to touch 
the drum with the tips of the fingers of one hand. 
If a Hitch Kick apparatus is not available a measuring scale 
may be marked on the corner of a post in the gymnasium, the 
pole vaulting stands or another convenient post that stands 11 
feet high. This scale should consist of narrow horizontal lines at 
intervals of 1 inch_running from 6 feet up to 11 feet. To 
execute the event with a scale of this sort the contestant, with or 
without a run, jumps off both feet and attempts to touch as high 
on the post as he can. Any attempt in which the contestant touches 
the wall with any part of his body before his fingers touch the 
scale counts as a trial without record. 
Each contestant is allowed three or five trials; the highest 
point touched in any trial is established as the contestant’s record.

217. Jump and Reach * 
A Hitch Kick apparatus is essential to the best conduct of this 
event. In preparation for the actual performance the contestant 
stands beneath the drum and determines the height of his normal 
reach with both feet touching the ground. For this purpose the 
contestant stretches one arm upward (heel on the floor) and the 
drum is gradually lowered until it touches the finger tips of the up- 
raised hand. The height of the drum at this point is noted. The

  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 101 
drum is then raised to any height the contestant wishes. Then, to 
execute the event, the contestant runs toward the drum, leaps off 
both feet and attempts to touch the drum with an upward thrust of 
one arm. The drum may be raised after each successful attempt, 
according to the contestant’s wishes. Three trials should be al- 
lowed at each height. After three unsuccessful trials at a given 
height the height of the last successful trial is taken as the 
contestant’s jump-reach. The difference between the normal 
standing reach and the jumping reach represents the record of 
performance. 
If a Hitch Kick apparatus is not available a measuring scale 
such as outlined in the Running High Touch may be utilized in 
this event also. To execute the event with this apparatus the 
contestant, holding a piece of chalk in one hand, stands beside 
the scale and reaching upward (keeping the heels on the floor) 
attempts to mark the scale as high as possible. Then, either stand- 
ing or running, he attempts by jumping off both feet and reaching 
upward at the same time to touch the scale as high as possible. The 
normal reach should be taken twice and the jumping reach should 
be taken five times; in each instance the highest mark becomes the 
accepted one. The linear distance between the two marks is taken 
as the performer’s record. 
218. Sky Jump * 
To carry on this event a kicking drum is required. In prepara- 
tion for the event the contestant stands directly under the drum; 
the drum is lowered until it touches his head; the height of the 
drum is recorded. The drum is raised then to any height the 
contestant wishes. To execute the event the contestant, leaping 
from both feet, jumps straight up attempting to touch the drum 
with his head. The feet must not leave the floor preliminary to 
the jump; doing so constitutes a foul and a trial without record. 
After a successful jump the drum is raised again to any height the 
contestant wishes. He is allowed three trials at each height. This 
continues until he fails to touch the drum. After a contestant has 
made one attempt at a given height he must finish his three trials 
at this height—it cannot be lowered. If a contestant sets the drum 
too high it is his own fault. The contestant’s record is taken as 
the distance the drum is raised from its original position to its 
position at the time of his highest jump. Each contestant thus 
jumps separately, continuing until he has finished. (Fig. 38.)

219. Bar Push for Distance 
The horizontal bar is well adapted for this event. The bar 
should be set at a height of four feet nine inches from the floor. 
In the gymnasium a mat, fixed so it will not slide, should be used. 
To perform the event the contestant takes the front support posi- 
tion on the bar; then jackknifing over the bar (moving both head 
and feet forward) he snaps his legs backward, at the same time 
  FIG. 38. SKY JUMP FIG. 39. STARTING POSITION FOR BAR

pushing off with his hands attempting to land on his feet as far 
away from the bar as possible. The mark is established at the 
point nearest the bar touched by any part of the contestant’s body. 
The distance is measured from the mark to a point directly beneath 
the bar at right angles to the same. (Fig. 39.) 
220. Bar Snap for Distance 
The horizontal bar is well adapted for this event. The bar 
should be set at a height of four feet nine inches from the ground. 
In the gymnasium a mat should be placed under the bar; when it is 
used it should be firmly fixed so it will not slide along the floor.
-P-A-G-E-111
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 103 
To perform the event the contestant stands facing the bar, holding 
it with both hands; then jumping his feet to a point in front of the 
bar, he shoots out beneath the bar letting go of the bar as he does 
so, attempting to land on his feet as far from the bar as possible. 
The mark is established at the point nearest the bar touched by 
any part of the contestant’s body. The distance is measured from 
the mark to a point directly beneath the bar and at right angles to 
the same. A 10-foot stick is handy in making rapid measurements.

FOR DISTANCE (AND HEIGHT) 
221. Bar Snap for Height 
The horizontal bar is well adapted for this event. Establish 
the bar at a height of four feet nine inches from the ground. In 
the gymnasium a mat should be used. Place jumping-stands with 
a jumping-stand rope about 30 inches in front of the bar. 
(A wooden cross bar should not be used.) To perform the event 
the contestant stands facing the bar grasping it with both hands; 
then he jumps his feet to a point just in front of the bar, and, swing- 
ing forward, shoots his body, feet foremost, under the bar and 
over the rope, letting go with the hands as he passes over the rope.
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
Touching the rope with any part of the body constitutes a failure. 
The rope is raised and the heights measured as in the high jump. 
222. Pirouette * 
This event may be carried on on the ground or on a floor. 
Establish a figure on the floor as per the attached diagram. The 
lines should be 3 feet long. To perform the event the contestant 
toes the starting line and jumps straight up into the air attempting 
to turn around as far as possible before landing. The contestant 
  FIG. 41. STARTING POSITION, PIROUETTE 
may land with feet apart or together. To make a valid pirouette, 
the contestant must retain his feet in the exact position of landing 
until his attempt has been marked. Any attempt in which the 
contestant fails to land on both feet simultaneously, falls over on 
the floor, touches his hands to the floor constitutes a foul and is 
considered unsuccessful. A successful trial is measured by 
placing a straight stick such as a wand or yard stick so it touches 
both. heels of the contestant. The trial is measured in terms of 
relationship of this line to the starting line. For example, con- 
testants may score 1%, 1%, 134, "46, %, 146 and so on. There 
are two ways in which the event may be conducted: (1) Allow 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 105 
a contestant to try until he succeeds in completing one and using 
this for his score; (2) giving a contestant five or ten trials and 
scoring his best. (Fig. 41.) (Dia. 20.)

223. Hanging Swing Jump 
A horizontal ladder or a set of inverted parallel bars is necessary 
for the conduct of this event. Establish a mark 6 inches from 
the end of each rail—at the same end of the apparatus—this is 
the take-off. To execute the event the contestant assumes a hanging 
position behind the take-off, one hand on each rail and facing 
the opposite end. Then, after swinging his body forward and back- 
ward, he jumps his hands forward as far as possible. The con-
-P-A-G-E-114
106 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
testant must hold both hands on the bar after making the jump— 
failure to do so constitutes a foul and a trial without record. The 
point nearest the take-off touched by the contestant is established 
as the mark. The distance is measured from the mark to the 
take-off. 
224. Support Swing Jump 
A set of parallel bars is necessary for the conduct of this event. 
The bars should be adjusted to a height of at least 5 feet. 
Establish a mark 6 inches from the end of each bar—at the 
same end of the apparatus—this is the take-off. To execute the 
event the contestant assumes a cross support position behind the 
take-off, facing the opposite end—one hand on each bar, elbows 
straight and feet together. Then after swinging his body forward 
and backward until he has sufficient momentum he bends his elbows 
as he starts to swing forward and jumps forward as far as possible 
landing in a cross support position. The second cross support 
position must be maintained until he has demonstrated that he has 
control of himself. Failure to hold this position constitutes a 
foul and a trial without record. The point nearest the take-off 
touched by either of the contestant’s hands is established as his 
mark. The distance is measured from the mark to the take-off. 
225. Standing Jump and Catch 
A horizontal ladder or a set of inverted parallel bars is neces- 
sary for the conduct of this event. Establish a line 3 feet long 
directly below one end of the apparatus used—this is the base line. 
(Use chalk.) Establish another line 2 feet from the base 
line and parallel to it—this is the take-off. To execute the event 
the contestant stands toeing the take-off and jumps and catches 
the ends of apparatus. The take-off line is gradually moved away 
from the base line in the same way that the bar is raised in the 
high jump. Two or three trials can be allowed at each distance. 
The distance from the take-off line to the base line on the occasion 
of the contestant’s best performance is taken as the contestant’s 
record. (Fig. 42.) 
226. Running Jump and Catch 
This event is conducted the same as the standing jump and catch 
with the exception that the contestant runs to the take-off. The
-P-A-G-E-115
  INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC EVENTS 107 
jump should be made off of both feet. Stepping over the take-off 
constitutes a foul and a trial without record. 
227. Peg Stretch * 
Two pieces of wood each 6 inches long and about an inch in 
diameter are necessary for the conduct of this event. Two corn- 
cobs or two relay batons serve the purpose very well. These are 
known as pegs. To execute the event the contestant takes one peg 
  FIG. 42, STARTING POSITION, STANDING 
JUMP AND CATCH 
in the palm of each hand, stands with his back to a wall (heels 
touching the wall), bends his knees, leans forward and places the 
ends of the two pegs on the ground, walks forward on the pegs 
and marks the ground as far forward as possible with one of the 
sticks. Then he walks backward on the pegs, raises the pegs 
' from the ground and rises to a standing position. Only the feet 
should touch the ground during the entire performance and the 
contestant should rise to a stand with his heels touching the wall 
after making his mark. Failure in either of these constitutes a
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
foul and a trial without record. The distance is measured from 
the base of the wall to the farthest point touched. Note: This event

may also be done from toeing the mark. It may also be performed 
by walking on the hands and marking with chalk. (Figs. 43-44.)

Mass Method 
The mass method, as the name indicates, is nothing more nor 
less than the place method so arranged that a large number can 
participate. The activities used in this type of work include most 
of the events found in the regular track and field program plus a 
number of other events similar in nature which are peculiarly 
adapted to this purpose. On the whole a mass athletic meet and 
a regular athletic meet are quite the same. The chief difference 
lies in the fact that the number taking part in a mass meet necessi- 
tates simpler methods of conduct. To accommodate the crowd 
it is impossible to observe all of the details of the rules drawn up 
for a regular meet; speedier methods are necessary in order to 
handle them. New methods of organization and scoring are also 
used. Due to the faster methods of conduct and scoring used the 
records made are not quite so accurate as they are in a regular 
meet. They are good enough in every case, however, to provide 
excellent competition. 
Universal Usage. 
Mass athletic meets are becoming increasingly popular. We 
find them used on the playground and in the gymnasium everywhere. 
They form a popular means of competition between grammar 
schools, high schools, and recently several inter-collegiate meets of 
this sort have been inaugurated. In high school and college we 
have inter-class mass athletic meets. We also have inter-play- 
ground meets and inter-church meets. They are used considerably 
in the Army and Navy. Meets of this sort are also jused in con- 
nection with single gymnasium classes or playground groups; in 
some cases a full period of from thirty to sixty minutes is devoted 
to this activity, and in other cases but one or two events are used 
at the close of a period. And on picnics and outings, too, this 
sort of a meet is extremely popular. 
A track and field meet carried on according to the official rules 
involves a great amount of detail; this fact rather precludes large 
numbers from participating in such a meet. Sixty or eighty is the 
109
-P-A-G-E-118
    110 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
most that can be satisfactorily handled in a two-hour program. By 
eliminating all time-consuming events and modifying the general 
mode of conduct a trifle a great number can be handled in a com- 
paratively short space of time.

GRADE SCHOOL MEET. (Junior High School) 
Grade school and junior high school mass athletic meets are 
now held in practically every city that makes any pretense at having 
an organized physical training program. These meets are organ- 
ized and carried on in a great variety of ways. It is outside of 
the purpose of this book to go into an elaborate discussion of these 
methods but a few of the outstanding features will be outlined. 
Classification. 
The classification of the contestants is a matter of primary 
consideration. Owing to the great differences of ability which 
exist in a group of this scope it is advisable to divide the members 
into several classes. If the group were not thus divided, while we 
might have all take part, only a few of the bigger and stronger 
boys could really be considered contestants. The smaller boys would 
merely take part. Physiological age is perhaps the best standard 
for classification, but owing to the diffculties attendant to securing 
proper records of the contestants it cannot even be considered. 
Combination Classifications. 
The classifications used center about four factors: age, height, 
weight and grade. In most cases but one of these factors serve
-P-A-G-E-119
MASS METHOD Tesh 
as the basis but in a few cases combination methods such as age- 
weight, age-grade, age-weight-height-grade and so on are used. 
It is argued that within any given single classification there are 
still great differences; for instance, if weight is used we have fat 
overgrown youngsters competing with older boys quite athletic in 
type; if age is used we have the puny boy competing with others of 
the same age quite athletic in makeup; and so on. So that if only 
one classification is used the competition still remains unfair. The 
answer to this charge is quite simple. It is true perhaps that it is 
more accurate to classify the contestants according to a combination 
method but the task of placing the contestants in their proper 
classes is so great and the possibilities of complication are so large 
that the effort at least for general use is not warranted. Besides, 
the object of mass athletics is participation, not computation— 
action, not accuracy. The time and energy-is far better spent in 
the promotion of activity. For this reason a single factor is pre- 
ferred to a combination of several. 
All Methods Unfair. 
Of the four methods used which is the best? Each has ad- 
vantages as well as disadvantages. If the standard chosen is grade 
there will be great discrepancies between the relative ability of the 
boys; twelve-year-old boys will be placed in the same class with 
boys fourteen and even fifteen. Yet from the standpoint of organi- 
zation this method is the simplest—each boy is automatically 
classified. 
If weight is used over-weight boys will be placed with wiry, 
muscular boys much older. In contests in which there is bodily 
contact, weight is a decided advantage but in individual athletic 
events it is a decided handicap. Yet weight offers a convenient 
method of classification—and there can be no cheating about it. 
Height is a fairer standard than weight and like the previous 
method may be easily determined but it, like the previous method, 
may be easily determined; however, it has the disadvantage of 
placing fleshy boys in the same class with those who are wiry and 
muscular to the decided disadvantage of the former. The loose- 
jointed fast-growing boy is also placed with the retarded athletic 
type to the serious handicap of the former. 
The age method like the others is quite simple from the stand- 
point of organization but here again we place diverse types in 
the same class—‘‘Lanky,” “Stubby,” “Fatty,” and “Skinny” all  
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
fallin the same group. Yet this standard is perhaps the fairest and 
most just of all. Age presupposes a certain degree of physical 
development. In view of the fact that a large majority of boys 
are normal (ninety per cent can be considered so) why complicate 
our methods by attempting to care for the small percentage of 
misfits? Throughout life age is the one outstanding standard of 
comparison—why not use the same standard in our athletic com- 
petition. Therefore, in view of the fact that all methods have 
their objections and the age method no greater objection than any 
of the other methods yet possesses the feature of offering the most 
logical basis of classification, this method is felt to be the best. 
Incomplete statistics which have been gathered at the University 
of Illinois indicate that the grade method is used most of all 
methods, the weight method next, the age method next with the 
height method registered in only one instance. 
Age. 
There is considerable variation in the usage of the age method 
hut in most cases 12 years is the lower limit and 15 years the upper 
limit. This cuts out anyone who is 16 years or older or 11 years 
or younger, giving four classes of contestants: 12 years, 13 years, 
14 years, and 15 years. In a few instances 11 year and 10 year 
groups are used also. And in a few cases after setting up definite 
groups such as 12 years, 13 years, 14 years, and 15 years there is 
added two other groups called Midgets and Giants—the midgets 
including those who are under 12 years and the giants those who 
are over 15 years. When using age as the basis for classification 
it is best to use birthdays as the dividing line, the individual passes 
into the next group on the day of his birthday. The date of the 
meet or the date of registration may be used as the point for placing 
the individuals. 
Grade. 
In the grade method of classification we find in use every grade 
from the fourth to the ninth. For the most part the most of the 
schools use only the upper grades—sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth. 
The fourth and fifth grades are really too small to handle. In 
some cases, especially in the larger school systems, two classes are 
made in each grade, A for those in the “A” division, B for those 
in the “B” division; in others this division is not made. Either 
of these classifications is satisfactory.
-P-A-G-E-121
  MASS METHOD 113 
Weight. 
The classes used in the weight method of classification vary 
greatly; some systems use under 65 pounds, 65 to 79 pounds, 
80 to 94 pounds, 95 to 109 pounds, 110 to 124 pounds and over 124 
pounds; others use, under 70 pounds, 70 to 89 pounds, 90 to 109 
pounds, over 109 pounds; others use under 75 pounds, 75 to 99 
pounds and over 99 pounds; and others use still different methods. 
The divisions given above, though, are more or less standard and 
may be readily adopted by almost any system. 
Height. 
The height method of classification is used only rarely. If any 
one wishes to use this method the following divisions are recom- 
mended. Under 48 inches, 48 to 52 inches, 52 to 56 inches, 56 to 
60 inches, 60 to 64 inches, 64 inches and over. Or the following: 
Under 50 inches, 50 to 55 inches, 55 to 60 inches, 60 inches 
and over. 
Number of Classes. 
How many classes should we use? As a general rule four, five 
or six classes is better than two or three. By having more classses 
of competition we have fairer competition. Let us take the weight 
division for example. If we use three classes we would have per- 
haps under 75, 75 to 99, and over 99 pounds. This would require 
boys weighing 75 pounds to compete against boys weighing 99 
pounds. On the other hand, if we had six classes we would per- 
haps have the following, under 60 pounds, 60 to 74 pounds, 75 to 
89 pounds, 90 to 104 pounds, 105 to 119 pounds and over 119 
pounds. This would require boys weighing 75 pounds to compete 
against boys weighing only 89 pounds. In the first case we have a 
25 pound variation within a given class, in the second we have a 
15 pound variation in the same class. The later classification is 
fairer. 
By having more classes we also have more winners and thus 
more glory. For instance, if we have three classes, use four events 
for each and award five places in each event we have sixty place 
winners, while if we have six classes with the same number of 
events and places we have one hundred and twenty place winners— 
just double the number.

Methods of Organization. 
Grade school meets are also carried on in a great variety of 
ways. In some systems each school runs a try-out meet in the 
various classes and only the two, three or four best performers are 
entered in a final meet. In other systems each school is allowed 
to enter eight or ten and even fifteen and twenty in each group. 
And in other systems (most, in fact), each school may enter as 
many as are interested. In some cities two school groups are used, 
large schools and small schools—Class A and Class B. In some of 
the larger cities sectional championships are necessary before a 
final meet. Which method should be used varies with the local sit- 
uations. Each leader has to work a program that is best suited to 
the local conditions. 
Preliminary Work. ; 
Above all things information concerning the meet should be cir- 
culated through the schools well in advance of the meet. This 
should include the events, their order, the rules of competition, the 
place of meeting, the day and hour of the meet, the nature of the 
prizes, the class divisions, the method of scoring, dress restrictions, 
if any, and so on. The meet should be given all the publicity pos- 
sible. Those in charge of physical training in the various schools 
should do all they can to stimulate and help the boys practice. 
Entries from each school should be sent into headquarters. It is 
best to have these in a week before the meet takes place. 
Events. 
In view of the fact that large numbers are to be handled the 
events for the most part should be limited to events which are not 
time-consumers. The most popular events for the various classes 
are shown in the accompanying table. (Table I.)

  MASS METHOD 115 
Number of Places. 
How many places should receive prizes and how many places 
should be scored in making up team totals? In some cases three 
are used, in others four, and in still others five. ‘Two conditions 
favor the larger number. In the first case the large number taking 
part suggest a reasonably large number of place winners—we 
should carry out the mass idea in all of its phases. And then by 
awarding more places we increase the number of actual scorers and 
place-holders, thus increasing the number who retain a lasting inter- 
est in the meet. 
Preparation. 
Usually an entire day or half a day is set aside for the meet. If 
an entire day is devoted to it the preliminaries should be run in the 
morning and the finals in the afternoon. If a stadium or regular 
athletic field is available, conditions are ideal. If not the com- 
peting field should be well roped off and policed; one or two police- 
men and a troop of boy scouts is of great assistance here. By all 
means keep the non-participants off the field of play; nothing inter- 
feres with a mass meet so much as a mob of onlookers milling 
around the grounds. All pits, running lanes, take-offs, and such, 
should be prepared before the meet starts. It is also well to ar- 
range a place for each team to meet and dress if this is wanted; 
tents are useful in this connection. Before the meet the field should 
be placarded for all of the events. The start and finish of the runs 
and all field events should be marked with signs readable from quite 
a distance. The signs should be erected on poles seven or eight 
feet high so they can be seen above the crowd. Low signs, besides 
being difficult to locate, are frequently trampled down. 
Headquarters. 
A tent should be erected at some place on the field where it would 
be most accessible. This should be used for information purposes; 
the referee should make his headquarters here; the prizes should 
be kept here; and it might also be used for a first aid tent. A 
12x14 tent is plenty large. If a tent is not available tables ar- 
ranged so they form a hollow square will do very well. A tent 
with tables in front is perhaps best of all. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
Prog 
Programs are very helpful but not absolutely necessary. A small 
meet of two or three hundred contestants may be carried on through 
announcement alone. If possible, though, the order of events should 
be posted. A large sign placed outside of the referee’s tent serves 
very well. The method of using single sheet programs is good ;— 
these may be printed or mimeographed. These sheets usually cover 
the order of events, a list of the schools taking part, and general 
information that would be helpful to the contestants. In large 
meets full programs are very useful. Programs of this sort in- 
clude the order of events, the list of officials, the heats for each 
event, the contestants in each heat and the time it is to be conducted, 
the time for semi-finals and finals, and all general information. A 
picture or two of something associated with the meet helps to make 
it a good souvenir. 
“Big Wooden Clock.” 
By using a clock, as they do at Detroit, the conduct of the meet 
is greatly facilitated. A large wooden clock can be erected where 
all can see it, preferably at the information tent where the referee 
can control it. Note should be made on the program that all events 
are to be run by the “Big Wooden Clock.” If the meet, scheduled 
to start at two o’clock, does not get under way until two-fifteen the 
“Big Wooden Clock”’ still stands at “two o'clock.” The hands 
are moved forward under the direction of the referee as the meet 
progresses. If a clock is used it is a good idea to use a large gong 
also. By ringing the gong each time the clock is moved contestants 
and officials alike have their attention called to the change. A 
bugle may be used in place of the gong. 
Prizes. 
Medals or ribbons may be used as prizes. Loving cups, ban- 
ners or shields may be presented to the teams winning the relays. 
And a loving cup may be presented to the school scoring the 
largest number of points. 
Officials. 
It is very important to get competent officials. If a college 
is handy members of the track team may be secured. Fathers 
of the children competing may be used also. Men are much
-P-A-G-E-125
  MASS METHOD 117 
better than women. Use the grade school teachers only as a 
last resort. When “pick-up” officials of this sort are used it is 
advisable to have them come half an hour or so before the meet 
is to start and hold a general conference with them regarding 
their duties, matters of conduct and so on. There should be at 
least two and if possible three officials for each event. It is not 
a bad idea to provide the officials with colored paper caps for 
use during the meet. In the general mélée a marker of this sort 
helps to distinguish them. 
Coaches. 
Each school should have a coach or director in charge. On 
reporting the coach can get the numbers for his team and dis- 
tribute them. Sometimes these are sent to the various schools 
and distributed a day or two before the meet. 
Limit Individual Competition. 
In some meets each boy is allowed to compete in only one 
event. In others the contestants are limited to two events, one 
track and one field. This is not a bad idea, because it has the 
effect of distributing the glory. By way of illustration, let us 
say there are twenty events and five places in each. By allow- 
ing a boy to compete in only one event we have one hundred dif+ 
ferent place winners. If, on the other hand, each boy can compete 
in as many events as he wishes, there is bound to be fewer. A 
few boys who are especially able athletes may take three or 
four places apiece. Still others may take two. So that instead 
of having one hundred boys going home with ribbons we may 
have less than fifty. This is not pure theory, but has been 
repeatedly demonstrated by actual experience. Another advan- 
tage is found in the fact that the amount of milling around is 
reduced. Each boy locates the scene of the particular event he 
is interested in, remains there until it is finished, and then he gets 
out of the arena. 
Conduct of Runs. 
In conducting the runs, lanes enough to accommodate every 
one without having to resort to more than trials, semi-finals and 
finals should be provided for. If possible eliminate the semi- 
finals, using only trials and finals. Once an event is started, it
-P-A-G-E-126
118 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
should be finished; it simply adds to confusion to run the final 
heat later on in the day. If the preliminaries can be conducted 
in the morning though, it is quite all right to run the finals in the 
afternoon. 
Conduct of Broad Jumps. 
In the broad jumping events pits should be provided for each 
group of fifty contestants in each class. If there were one hundred 
and fifty entered in the running broad jump for the 75-89 
pound class, for instance, there should be three run-ways and 
pits. A 15 foot pole graduated in feet and inches is much 
better for marking than a tape. The director in charge should 
determine beforehand whether there is time for two or three 
trial jumps. 
Conduct of Throws. 
For the baseball throw there should be one throwing field for 
each group of 50-75 contestants in each class. Ample balls should 
be provided so there is no delay waiting for balls to come back 
to the throwing line. The ground can be lined off at five yard 
intervals from one hundred to two hundred and forty feet for 
this event. Markers showing the distance should be placed at 
one of each. The judge using a five-yard stick graduated in feet 
and inches can readily get the distances. Two throws will be 
ample for this event. By having each contestant make both of 
his throws in immediate succession the judges may mark the first 
throw and then mark and measure the second throw, if it is 
farther, or neglect the second throw and mark the first, if the 
second is shorter. This saves time. The regular nine-inch ball 
should be used with senior high school boys and adults. The 
Junior size baseball is best adapted for use with grade school 
or junior high school boys. 
Conduct of Shot Put. 
For the shot put event there should be a putting circle for each 
group of 50-75 boys. There should be at least two shots for each 
circle. Three would be better. The ground can be lined off with 
semi-circles at two foot intervals from twenty feet to forty feet. 
Markers showing the distance should be placed at the end of each 
line. Using a two-foot ruler the judge can readily determine the
-P-A-G-E-127
  
MASS METHOD 119 
distance of the puts. If lines are not used the zero end of a tape 
may be fixed at the center of the front of the ring. This is not 
quite so accurate as measuring from the center of the ring, but 
it is accurate enough and very efficient. Two puts are ample for 
this event. By having each contestant make his two puts in suc- 
cession, the longest only needs to be measured. The eight-pound 
shot should be used. 
Conduct of High Jump. 
For the high jump there should be one jumping pit for each 
30 or 40 contestants. The bar should be started low, but arbitrarily 
raised over fairly long intervals the first three or four times it 
is moved, until the number of contestants has been reduced to 
ten or thereabouts. From this point on it may be raised as in a 
regular meet. It is best to give the contestants but two trials at 
a height. Extra cross bars to replace those broken should be 
at hand. 
Conduct of Relays. 
In some cities only four or five boys are used on the relay team; 
others use eight or ten or fifteen, and even as many as thirty or 
forty. In keeping with the mass idea a larger number is better but 
more than twenty becomes a little unwieldy. From ten to fifteen 
makes a very practical number. The distance should be adjusted 
so each boy running in the relay runs not farther than twice as far 
as the distance used for the dash for this particular group. In the 
75-89 pound class for instance, each boy would run not over 120 
yards. If there are only four or five teams competing the relays 
may be run around a track. If there are more it is better to run 
them inlanes. In either case batons should be used—either a short 
stick or a handkerchief will do. If lanes are used they should be 
9 or 10 feet wide and there should be objects at each end around 
which the contestants should be required to turn. The runners 
should run around the object at the far end and pass the baton to 
the next runner in back of the object at the starting line. Stakes 
four or five feet long, firmly stuck in the ground, make very good 
turning points. 
Judging and Recording. 
If programs with a full list of contestants, heats and so on are 
available the judges may use these for recording; otherwise separ-
-P-A-G-E-128
  
  120 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
ate scoring sheets should be provided. In some meets the head 
judge for each event gives each winner a note stating the place he 
finished and the bearers of the same present them at the prize tent 
for their prizes. In other meets it is customary to have the prizes 
formally presented at the close of the meet by some local function- 
ary. The last method is perhaps the better. If this method is 
used, though, long-winded speeches should be avoided. In a few 
cases the prizes are given to the winners several days later at 
school; this is not so desirable. Give the boy his prize on the 
ground on the day of the meet. The little ceremony of a formal 
presentation here adds much to its value. 
Order of Events. 
It is impossible to set down any specific principles as to the order 
of events and the method of shifting. Each individual meet offers 
its own problems which must be thrashed out by the authorities 
running the meet. The whole meet must be plotted out and all its 
phases thoroughly visualized before the final plans are established. 
Above all things spread the scenes of action for the various events 
as far apart as possible; this must be done to provide room for 
those actually performing as well as those who are just milling 
around. In conducting the first meet of this sort faults are to be 
expected. It is on the experience of past meets that one can prop- 
erly organize and carry out those of the present and future. 
Publicity. 
General publicity should not be neglected. Posters, newspaper 
notices, banners and so on should all be used. Anything that is 
worth doing is worth advertising. Providing the school children 
with tickets to sell to their parents produces excellent results. The 
fees collected in this way will defray the expenses of the meet. 
Care should be taken however not to commercialize these games 
as our varsity sports are commercialized. A nominal fee of five 
or ten cents is much better than a larger sum. 
If possible have a band. A grade school athletic meet is really 
a gala affair and nothing tingles the hearts of the youngsters more 
than band music. A high school band may be secured in many 
communities. 
Check-up Before Meet. 
The organizers should be very careful to see that all miscel- 
laneous equipment needed for the meet are on the grounds before
-P-A-G-E-129
  
MASS METHOD 121 
the meet starts. It is not a bad plan to appoint one individual with 
a predisposition for details to check up this matter shortly before 
the meet starts. Then if anything is missing it may be gotten 
before it is actually needed. In this connection it will be found 
very helpful if a list which covers the various essential articles and 
details of field organization, such as the following, is available. 
. Shots, discuses, baseballs, jumping stands, and similar equipment. 
Extra cross bars. 
Stop watches, whistles, megaphones, etc. 
Starting guns with cartridges.

SPECIAL SCHOOL MEETS. 
Indoor Grade School Meets. 
Indoor meets are also held in a number of cities where well or- 
ganized systems of physical training exist. As a general rule the 
events used are different from those used in the regular outdoor 
meet. This is a good idea, because if the same events were used 
the same boys would win in both; by having a different set of 
events in each we enable a separate set of boys to win each, thus 
doubling the number of gladdened hearts. The following events 
will be found to be quite practical in an indoor meet. The size, 
shape and layout of the hall, the number of contestants, the number 
of classes, and the amount of time available all influence the number 
of events used, but as a general rule four or five or six are all that 
can be handled. 
The number of contestants that can be handled in a meet of this 
sort of course depends largely on the size of the hall. The or- 
ganizers should attempt to handle as many as possible, yet care 
should be taken not to get the number so large that confusion pre- 
vails. The number may be controlled by putting a limit on the 
number of entries in each class from each school.

Indoor meets of this kind are usually held in the evening. ‘The 
program should be arranged to start as early as possible, thus in- 
suring an early finish. A short meet that can be completed in two 
hours is better than one which runs on for three or four, as they 
too often do. 
The organization and general conduct of the meet is otherwise 
about the same as that of the outdoor meet. 
Individual School Meets. 
At the present time there is a considerable number of Junior 
High Schools and Senior High Schools that run meets for their 
own separate constituents. In some cases this meet represents the 
big feature of the year. In other cases it is conducted as a pre- 
liminary to a city meet. By using the same events used in the city 
championships it becomes a sort of a tryout for the big affair. 
Sometimes these meets are carried on after school and sometimes 
an entire afternoon is given over to them. When the meet is car-
-P-A-G-E-131
MASS METHOD 123 
ried on after school, it may be completed at one meeting or it may 
be distributed over two or three or four. Several instructors have 
found it very practical to use one event each evening—Monday, 
all of the runs, Tuesday all of the jumps, Wednesday all of the 
threws and Thursday all of the relays. 
Meets of this sort are frequently organized on a combination 
classification basis. The most popular combinations are grade- 
weight, grade-height, and age-weight. The first is used as a prin- 
cipal factor and the second as a secondary factor for the purpose 
of further subdividing the constituents. ‘Two divisions are usually 
found; these are called midgets and giants. With the grade- 
weight method, for instance, we have in the Junior High School 
three grades, seven, eight and nine. The boys in each are weighed 
and the norm for each established. Those who weigh above the 
norm in each group become “giants,’’ those who fall below the 
norm are “midgets.” Thus we have (1) seven-giants, (2) seven- 
midgets, (3) eight-giants, (4) eight-midgets, (5) nine-giants, and 
(6) nine-midgets—a total of six classes for competition. The 
other combinations are worked out on the same basis. 
ARMY MEET 
To illustrate how a mass meet may be handled with adults ‘let 
me outline one that was carried on in one of the training camps 
during the recent mobilization. Twelve companies totaling about 
1200 men took part in this meet. Six events—the 40 yd. dash, the 
100 yd. dash, the running broad jump, the triple jump, the shot put 
(12 Ib.) and the baseball throw—were used. Places were 
established for the conduct of each of the events in quite widely 
separated areas. The participants were divided into six sections, 
two companies, or about 200 to a section. The six sections were 
then sent to the different parts of the field where the various events 
were to be held. 
Arrangement of Field. 
In this meet the field was arranged somewhat after the plan 
of the accompanying diagram. (Dia. 21.) 
Conduct of Runs. 
The various events were conducted in the following ways. In 
the runs each company was lined up behind separate starting lines

and each working separately, carried on the following competition. 
A quarter of the company, or approximately 25, were run in each 
heat; the first four men in each heat were held at one side of the 
finish line. The sixteen winners then ran in a second heat. The 
first four were selected and their names taken by the head judge. 
Conduct of Broad Jump. 
The jumps were conducted as follows. Two sets of take-offs and 
pits were used—one for each company. The two companies were 
each placed in line just back of its take-off. The members of each 
company, performing one at a time, started to jump. It should 
be pointed out, for fear of misinterpretation, that the two com-
-P-A-G-E-133
  MASS METHOD 125 
panies were jumping independently. The first four jumps were 
recorded by a deep scratch in the side of the jumping pit and the 
jumpers themselves told to stand according to their places just back 
of the judges. ‘The other contestants continued to take their turns 
at jumping, but thereafter any contestant who “out jumped” any 
of the best four jumps moved everyone who held a place behind 
his leap back one place, and eliminated the holder of fourth place. 
For instance, let us assume that a contestant set a mark between 
second and third place; this jumper was asked to stand in third 
place at the side of the pit, the contestant who held third place 
consequently moved down to fourth place. The holder of fourth 
place was eliminated. When two players were tied with the same 
mark both took position at the side of the pit, one behind the other. 
Players who were eliminated were assembled on the opposite side 
of the pit far enough back to be out of the way. Each contestant 
was given but one trial. The jumping continued in this way until 
all had jumped. The names of the holders of the four lea 
places were taken, four for each company. (Dia. 22.)

Conduct of Throws. 
The throws were conducted in the same general manner as the 
jumps. Two sets of throwing lines and fields were used—one for 
each Company. The two Companies each working under the direc- 
tion of separate officials were run through the event independently
-P-A-G-E-134
  
126 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
and at the same time. Throwing lines and fields were used in 
place of rings. For the shot put the throwing line was 15 feet 
long; two parallell lines running out fifty feet from the ends of 
the throwing line established the limits of the field. For the base- 
ball throw the throwing line was fifty feet long; the side lines one 
hundred yards. For each field there were provided four markers 
ten inches long, two inches wide and one-half inch thick, sharpened 
at one end. q 
In carrying on the event the contestants were placed in back of 
the throwing line. The records of the first four throwers were 
marked; a marker was stuck into the ground at the point where 
the ball landed. The thrower’s initials were chalked on the marker. 
The judge at the throwing line told them to the judge who was 
working in the field. Thereafter when any throw landed in front of 
the poorest mark (fourth place) the stick marking fourth place 
was pulled out, the old initials erased, the initials of the new thrower 
put down and then stuck into the ground at the point of the new 
mark. The relative position of the throws were gauged by visual 
inspection only. The judge in the field merely estimated them with 
his eye. The throwing line was used as a base for these estimates. 
After throwing, each contestant took a position along one of the 
side lines away from the throwing line. Each contestant was given 
but one trial. Throws which landed over the side lines were con- 
sidered foul and not recorded. The throwing continued until all 
had competed. The names of the players who made the best four 
throws were then taken. (Dia. 23.)

  MASS METHOD 127 
Rotating. 
On completing an event the sections were required to remain at 
their stations until all of the sections had finished. Each section 
then, under the direction of the referee, rotated to the scene of the 
next event and immediately activities were recommenced. 
Conduct of Finals. 
When each section had completed all of the events all were 
called to the 40 yd. dash area. The four winners of the 40 yd. 
dash of each company, totalling forty-eight, were then assembled 
at the starting line and put through the finals, all running in one heat. 
The names and organizations of the four leaders were taken. In 
turn then, the company winners competed in the running broad 
jump, the shot put, the triple jump, the baseball throw and the 100 
yd. run. Eight points, four points, two points and one point were 
given for the first four places in each event. 
In the preliminary trials no records were kept. In the final 
competition, however, the records were taken; this consisted only 
of timing the runs, and measuring the performances of the four 
leaders in each of the other events. 
Officials. 
There were three judges for each company in the runs, (one 
served as starter and the other two as judges of the finish) and 
two judges for each company in the other events (one covered the 
take-off or throwing line and the other covered the landing place). 
The judges serving at opposite ends of an event communicated with 
each other both by voice and signal. The officials did not rotate 
with the players. 
Conduct of Height Events. 
Events which involve height measurement may also be used but 
at best they take considerably more time than the other events. In 
this field the most practical are the standing high jump, the running 
high jump, the bar vault and the fence vault. To conduct these 
events expeditiously there should be eight sets of apparatus ar- 
ranged in a row with bars graduated from a comparatively low 
position at one end to a comparatively high position at the other. 
The arrangement for the standing high jump, by way of illustra-
-P-A-G-E-136

tion, should be something similar to the following diagram. 
(Dia. 24.)

  DIAGRAM 24 
In performing these height events the contestant starts at the 
lower height and jumps or vaults over each successive height until 
he is eliminated. Each contestant is allowed only one trial at 
each height. After failing at one height though, a contestant is al- 
lowed to try the next height. Contestants failing on two heights 
in succession are eliminated. To conduct one of these events there 
should be four or five judges. The contestants are arranged in 
column and each judge takes a contestant and follows him through 
until he is eliminated. If any of these events were used in a meet 
of the type previously outlined, the best four performers could be 
kept to one side as in the broad j jumps and throws. At the end of 
the meet as in the meet previously outlined the winners of each 
group could be assembled and the finals conducted.

CHAPTER IV 
Modified Mass Method 
As pointed out before, to conduct a mass athletic meet it is neces- 
sary to simplify some of the procedures used in a regular athletic 
meet. By modifying our procedure still further, it is possible to 
carry ona slightly different type of meet that is at once practical, 
expeditious and popular. The underlying principle in a meet of 
this sort is that all of the contestants, or half, compete at one time. 
This consideration automatically eliminates all events requiring 
special equipment and thus limits us more or less to the following 
types of events:

Weight carrying (another boy of the same weight) 
30 to 60 yards

130 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
Conduct of Runs. 
Because of the number taking part, it is necessary to conduct the 
running events on a so-called straight-away. For any of these 
events, the instructor must establish two parallel lines,—one is 
the starting line, the other the finish line. These lines should be 
long enough to provide three feet for each contestant competing. 
Their distance apart varies with the event used. To conduct a 
race, the instructor puts the group in line behind the starting line, 
explains the race, has it demonstrated, points out the fouls, and 
then starts it as any other race. The judges are empowered to 
eliminate unfair runners and picks the winners at the finish line.

Because of the distance involved, the runs are better conducted 
outdoors than inside but if they have to be conducted indoors or 
in a relatively narrow space outside the instructor may have the 
competitors run back and forth across the gymnasium or yard. 
Running from the starting line to a line on the opposite side of 
the floor and back is satisfactory. Or if blank walls are available, 
they may run from wall to wall. To cover a longer distance, how- 
ever, the contestant may be required to run over and back two, 
three or more times. When back and forth running like this is 
used, the instructor should be careful to explain that each contest- 
ant must keep in a direct lane. One or two judges should be placed 
at each end with power to eliminate any contestant failing to touch 
the turning points.
-P-A-G-E-139
  MODIFIED MASS METHOD 131 
Conduct of Jumps. 
To conduct the jumps, it is necessary to establish one straight 
line allowing about three feet for each contestant—this is the take- 
off line. Indoors, give each contestant a piece of chalk; outdoors, 
have each get a pointed chip of wood or a small stone. Name 
the particular jump. Demonstrate it and point out the fouls. 
Place the contestants toeing the take-off line. Be sure each has 
sufficient room—four or five feet should be satisfactory for 
most events. At signal, all of the contestants execute the pre- 
scribed. jump. Each makes a mark on the ground with his stick 
(or chalk) at the point nearest the take-off touched by himself. 
Outdoors, a string or a long stick may be used to determine the 
best jumps. To do this with a string or a measuring stick the 
object used should be longer than the best performance. The in- 
structor determines a few of the best performances by inspection, 
holds the string or measuring stick from the take-off line to each 
and thus determines the relative positions. Indoors, by having 
the take-off line run along one of the cracks in the floor, the best 
jumps may be easily determined by sighting along the cracks at 
the point of the marks. If the floor glares and the marks cannot 
be readily seen objects may be placed on a few of the best marks 
and the positions easily determined; in this connection the instruc- 
tor may have the contestants stand heeling their marks. 
In the jumps it is not a bad idea to have each execute two or 
three or five leaps always keeping his best leap and using this for 
his mark. Or the class may be given two minutes and told to make 
as many trials as they wish. When this procedure is used each con- 
testant keeps the record of his best leap for his final mark as 
mentioned before. 
In order to get more accurate records and in a few cases avoid 
cheating, the instructor may have the class count off by twos and 
have the ones jump and the twos judge and mark them, and then 
have the twos jump and the ones judge and mark them. In large 
classes, this is especially advisable. (Dia. 26.) 
Conduct of Strength Events. 
The strength events may be carried on in two ways. By one 
method the event is named and demonstrated, care being taken 
to point out fouls. The class is then put in position to start; lying 
on the chest for the push-ups; standing on one foot with the other

leg squat, sitting on the floor with toes fixated for the sit-ups. The 
instructor then commands ‘“‘Start” and all start to perform the 
event. Then in slow rhythm he counts the performances ‘“‘One,” 
“Two,” “Three,” “Four” and so on. Each performer regulates 
his work to the count of the instructor. Any contestant who falls 
behind the instructor’s count, or fails to complete a performance 
or fouls in any other way should stop or be stopped by the judges 
immediately. Two or three judges should be distributed among 
the performers to halt any one who violates any of these condi- 
tions. The instructor continues counting until all have stopped. 
With this method it is easy to determine the winners; when the 
competition narrows down to five the judges note the order of 
their halting. A circle formation may be used instead of a line 
in this method. (Dia. 27.)

  MODIFIED MASS METHOD 133 
By the other method the group is numbered off by twos. Each 
“One” with the “Two” on his left constitute a pair. Each pair 
then works independently; each “One” performs while his number 
“Two” judges and records and then the two reverse. At the finish 
the instructor determines the winners by a process of questioning. 
Officials. 
To judge the various events the instructor may pick two or 
three boys from outside of the class who may be present as 
spectators. If there are any members of the class temporarily 
crippled or otherwise handicapped so they cannot take active part 
in the competition, these may be used. And again, it is not a bad 
idea to use the two or three best performers in the class in this 
capacity. This last method has the advantage of giving mediocre 
performers a chance to “shine,” when normally this would be quite 
impossible. 
Methods of Use. 
Events of the above kind may be used in several different ways. 
One or two events may be used at the close of a physical training 
period or an entire period may be devoted to them. They may 
be used in the gymnasium or on the playground. ‘They may be 
conducted on the basis of individual competition or on the basis of 
team competition. 
If used at the close of a gym period, the individual competition 
basis is the most satisfactory. The instructor merely puts the 
class in line, has them go through with the event and at the finish de- 
clares the winners of first, second and third places. If the instructor 
wishes, fourth and fifth places may be added. 
If used for an entire period, any of three methods may be used. 
(1) Each event may be carried on and places awarded separately 
as outlined above. 
(2) The events may be carried on separately as outlined above, 
but the winners of the first five places in each event are given 
points, five, four, three, two and one. At the close of the period, 
the individual having the most points is declared the winner; the 
individual having the next highest score is given second; and so on, 
awarding four or five places. 
(3) Or the group may be divided into teams. From two to 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
four teams give the best results but five or six may be used. From 
six to twenty players may be used on a team but from eight to 
twelve is perhaps the best number, unless only two teams are com- 
peting when twenty may be used. When teams are competing in 
this way, the first four place winners in each event score points for 
their respective teams, usually four, three, two, and one. At the 
end the teams are awarded positions according to their total points. 
Negative Scores. 
To add variety to a meet of this sort (type 3) the poorest per- 
former, or last man in each event may be given two negative points 
and the next to the last one negative point. Or, the poorest per- 
formers only may be given one negative point. These points are 
substracted from the score of the respective teams of which these 
individuals are members. This stimulates the poor performers to 
do their very best and gives the competition an added interest. 
At the close of the competition, the teams are placed according 
to their total points. Under efficient management, eight or ten 
events may be conducted in a period of forty minutes. The score 
may be kept chalked on a floor or on a blackboard where every 
one can see it during the course of the meet. This adds to the 
interest of the work. The instructor may make a program of all 
runs or all jumps or all strength events, but it would be better per- 
haps to use a few of each. Three runs, three jumps and two 
strength events make an excellent program. 
A GYM CLASS MEET. 
A meet of this variety conducted in the University of Illinois 
gymnasium was carried on as follows. Thirty students were in the 
class. They were placed in line along one side of the gym—toeing 
the side line of the basketball court and its extension—standing 
at intervals of about two feet; each contestant thus had about four 
feet.of space. The class counted off in twos;—‘‘ones” constituted 
one team, “twos” another. Seven events were used—the standing 
broad jump, three pegs, backward jump, crab walk, all fours, 
squat jumping, and the floor dips. 
Conduct of Jumps. 
The standing broad jump was announced to be the first event. 
All contestants were then asked to practice this freely using the line 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
MODIFIED MASS METHOD 135 
as the take-off. This was carried on for about a minute. The 
contestants were then halted and placed in line—a whistle was 
used. Each number “one” was given a small piece of chalk. The 
instructor then announced that each “one”? would work with the 
“two” on his left—one to jump and the other, using the chalk, to 
mark his performances and then reverse—each contestant to take 
three jumps—jumping freely at their own time. When this was 
completed the contestants were placed in line, the instructor sighted 
along the cracks in the floor in the region where the jumps had 
been marked, and after coming to a decision, announced the four 
best jumps and the one poorest jump. The teams on which the 
makers of these jumps belonged were determined and the scores 
were computed—four, three, two and one positive points for the 
four best and one negative point for the poorest. 
The three pegs and the backward jump were conducted in the 
same way. 
Conduct of Runs. 
To carry on the crab walk the contestants were placed in their 
original line. The event was demonstrated and the rules were ex- 
plained ;—each contestant was to travel to the line on the opposite 
side of the floor and back. Emphasis was given the point that 
“each contestant must touch the opposite line or be eliminated.” 
A preliminary race was conducted,—this was done to make sure 
each knew exactly how he was to perform. Then the race was 
conducted,—all running at one time. The four who crossed the 
finish line first and the one who crossed it last were picked by the 
judges, their respective teams determined, and the scores recorded. 
The “‘all fours” event and the “squat jumping” event were con- 
ducted in the same way. 
Conduct of Floor Dips. 
The contestants were placed in their original positions for the 
floor dips. ‘The event was demonstrated and explained. All were 
then placed on their chests on the floor. Then, standing in front 
of the class, the instructor called ‘Start’ upon which all began to 
straighten and bend their elbows in unison with the instructor who counted CUWpy “One,” “Up,” “Two,” “Up,” “Three,” “Up,” 
“Four” and so on. Judges walking along the lines of contestants 
stopped those who fell behind the count or failed to perform the
-P-A-G-E-144
  
136 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
event correctly. The first player and the last four players to drop 
out were thus determined and the scores recorded. 
Previous to the meet the instructor had appointed two of the 
students to act as his assistants. These men did not take part in 
the meet but served as judges in the different events. 
The Score. 
The score was kept on the floor in chalk something as follows.

The table above illustrates the use and effect of scoring negative 
points for the poorest performances. Team I scored the greatest 
number of positive points but they also scored heavily in negative 
points. After subtracting the negative points team II had the 
better score. 
The meet took less than thirty minutes from the moment the men 
were placed in line at the start until the final score was announced.

CHAPTER V 
Relay Method 
The so-called relay meet is perhaps the most popular type of 
mass meet used. The organization and conduct of a meet of this 
kind is so supremely simple that time and again during the war an 
entire regiment was called on the field and conducted through an 
inter-company meet in which every man in the regiment took part 
without a single individual, participant or official being previously 
acquainted with what was to take place. It must be admitted, how- 
ever, that somewhat better results are secured if the parties in- 
volved are forewarned of the events and have a general idea of the 
nature of the meet. 
In the ordinary relay race the players run around a circular track; 
in a mass meet of this type because of the number of teams and 
contestants taking part, it is more practical to run back and forth 
in lanes. 
Events. 
Any line or column relay race may be used but the following are 
found to be especially well adapted: 
1. Sprinting tr. Rescue 
2. Leap Frog 12. Stand Up 
3. Crawl Through Legs 13. Potato 
4. Jump Stick 14. Wheelbarrow 
5. Centipede 15. Obstacle 
6. Caterpillar 16. Straddle Ball 
7. Chariot 17. Equipment 
8. Donkey 18. Paul Revere 
9. All Fours 19. Sack 
10. Down-and-Up 20. Hopping 
Teams. 
Any number of teams between two and twelve may take part in a 
meet of this kind, although, unless the director can be assured of 
good class behavior, the number should be limited to four, six, or 
137
-P-A-G-E-146
  
  138 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
eight. From eight to twenty-five players may be used on a team, 
though from twelve to fifteen give the most satisfactory resuits. 
The meet may be carried on quite informally or it may be organ- 
ized to any degree desirable. When used intra-unit, that is within 
a gym class or some similar unit, it is best to conduct the meet in- 
formally ; when used inter-unit, that is between several gym classes, 
departments, schools, geographical sections and so on, it is better to 
have some degree of organization. 
AN INFORMAL MEET. 
An informal meet would be carried on somewhat after the fol- 
lowing manner. Let us assume we have a gym class of sixty mem- 
bers. The instructor divides the group into five teams of twelve 
players each. He places them in parallel columns about ten feet 
apart and abreast of a common line in one end of the gym or at one 
end of the field. He appoints a captain for each team; this player 
serves as captain, coacli, and judge of his own team. He is author- 
ized to stimulate them, coach and help them in any way he can, see 
that they play according to the rules and disqualify them if they 
fail todo so. While carrying on these activities he stands near his 
team “‘pepping”’ them up, warning them against mistakes, keeping 
them in formation, and so on. He may or may not participate in 
the race ;—if he does he should run either first or last. Because 
of the variety of functions they serve, care should be taken in the 
selection of. these captains. 
Method of Conduct. 
Equipment and marks are established for the first race. Above 
all things have turning points that the runners must run around 
rather than touch and return. The director then explains the first 
relay. For the purpose of insuring a perfect understanding it is 
best to have each team go through the elements of it informally be- 
fore actual competition. Then conduct the relay. In the same way 
introduce the other relays; eight makes a good number for a forty 
minute period. 
In a meet of this sort the arrangements would be as hereafter 
diagramed. (Dia. 28.) 
Award five points for first place, four for second, three for third, 
two for fourth and one for fifth. If there are only four teams 
score four places—four, three, two and one. If there are eight 
teams score eight places. The team making the most points in all
-P-A-G-E-147
RELAY METHOD 139 
of the events wins. Indoors the score may be kept by chalking 
each team’s score on the floor just in front of its position at the 
starting line. (See Dia. 28.)

A FORMAL MEET. 
To illustrate how a more formal meet may be carried on let me 
describe one which was held with a regiment of soldiers. Com- 
panies make splendid units for competition of this kind. Before 
the meet the field was marked off according to the following dia- 
gram. The lines were put in with lime. It will be noted that there 
is one lane for each team or company. The several turning-point
-P-A-G-E-148
    140 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
lines were established to accommodate the needs of the various 
relays. Stakes were used for turning points. These were placed 
on the lines in the center of each lane for turning points just before 
each race as they were needed. (Dia. 29.)

RELAY METHOD 141 
The regiment was assembled about the three sides of the field 
as illustrated. No one was placed back of the starting lanes be- 
cause the competitors standing here would obstruct the view from 
this point and thus any one placed there would have been denied 
the pleasure of watching the races. A rope stretched around the 
field twenty feet from the side lines was very helpful in keeping 
the spectators off the field. 
Officials. 
Before the meet a referee (a major), a starter (a captain) and 
twelve judges (lieutenants) were appointed. The referee to act 
as final arbiter, the starter to start the races, and each judge to act 
as judge of one team. Each judge was empowered to disqualify 
his team for unfair competition of any sort and determine the place 
his team secured at the finish. In order to facilitate the determina- 
tion of places the races were so arranged that the last runner 
finished at the end line. Each company had a coach, in most cases 
the officer in charge of athletics. The organizer of the meet acted 
as general director and made all announcements. 
Events. 
It was decided to use eight events in the following order: 
. Crawl through legs 
. Leap Frog 
Donkey 
. Wheelbarrow 
All fours 
. Jump Stick 
. Centipede (4 men on tent pole) 
. Sprinting 
Method of Conduct. 
Everything was ready; now for the races. It was announced 
that each company was to furnish a fresh team for each two races, 
the first platoon was to furnish a team for the first and second 
events, the second for the third and fourth, the third for the fifth 
and sixth, and the fourth for the seventh and eighth. Twenty-four 
mentoateam. With such large numbers available it was deemed 
better to have each company enter a new group to compete for each 
set of tworaces. This carries out the idea of mass athletics. From 
this point the meet continued as previously outlined, except that 
each team went thru each race informally before the actual race 
OW 
AN 
PO

was conducted. This was done to make sure that every one knew 
exactly what was to be done. The first five teams were scored 
5-4-3-2-1 respectively. The meet was completed an hour and forty 
minutes after the men arrived on the field. 
Score Board. 
An athletic meet is always made much more interesting if a score 
board large enough to be seen from all points of the field is erected. 
An arrangement whereby the names of the teams and their total 
scores may be shown will do but an arrangement according to the 
following plan will be better yet. (Table III.)

Other Methods Possible. 
The two methods outlined are illustrative of the two extreme 
methods by which a meet of this kind may be carried on. There 
are innumerable variations and novelties which may be used; the 
two meets outlined are merely suggestive, an imaginative instructor, 
using them as a basis, can formulate and carry on a meet of this 
type to fit almost any group, playing area and time-allowance.
-P-A-G-E-151

tion and the movements of a weaving shuttle—the players run,

type is very popular, and its conduct exceedingly simple. 
Events. 
Only those events which cover distances may be used and quite 
naturally they fall into three classifications—(1) the runs, (2) 
the throws. A great number of events may be 
used in a meet of this type but the most popular and practical are the jumps, (3)

-P-A-G-E-152
  144 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
The methods for conducting the different types of events are as 
follows: 
Conduct of Runs. 
Strictly speaking this method of conducting running events is but 
a variation of the lane method outlined under the Relay meet. The 
teams run in lanes in the same way, but in this case each team is 
divided in half and placed at opposite ends of the lane. In the 
former case each player runs up and back, in this case each runs in 
but one direction. In view of the fact that this latter method 
is popularly known as the shuttle type of relay and, further, con- 
forms in type with the other shuttle events it may be logically in- 
cluded here. 
Establish two parallel lines ;—length according to the number of 
teams competing (allow ten or twelve feet to the teams) ;—dis- 
tance apart according to the requirements of the event to be con- 
tested (60 feet, 100 feet, 300 feet or any other distance desirable). 
Divide each team into two groups of equal number and place the 
two groups opposite each other on the two lines. Give the first 
player of the “A” half of each team a baton. At signal the baton 
holder of each team, moving in the prescribed manner, advances to 
the “B” half of his team and passes the baton to the first player 
there. This player advances to the “A” half where he passes the 
baton to the second player who advances with it to the “B” half, 
etc. At the time of receiving the baton each player must be stand- 
ing in back of the starting line. The runners of each team continue 
shuttling back and forth in this manner until all have run. The 
team finishing first wins. (Dia. 30.) 
Conduct of Jumps. 
In these events two teams compete against each other. To carry 
on an event arrange the two teams in separate lines on opposite 
sides of the playing field and have each count oft consecutively. 
Establish a line two feet long in the centre of the field—this is the 
“base line.”’ ‘Number one” of team “A,” toeing the base line, 
makes the prescribed jump. The point of ground nearest the base 
line touched by the jumper is marked. (This may be a heel mark,

hand mark or seat mark.) “Number one” of team “B,” using as a 
toe line the mark of the first jumper, makes a return jump. This 
jump is marked. ‘Number two” of team “A” then jumps back 
from the mark made by ‘“‘Number one” of team “B.” “Number 
two” of team “‘B” jumps next. “Number three” of team “A” jumps 
next, and so forth; the teams alternate until every man has jumped. 
If the last man of team ‘“‘B” jumps beyond the original base line 
that team wins; if his jump falls short, that team loses. 
One of the problems which develops in the conduct of a contest 
of this sort is that in the running jumps some of the contestants 
step over the take-off line. This situation can be handled by 
penalizing such contestants twice the distance they step over the 
line. In other words a contestant who steps over ten inches will 
have his mark moved back twenty inches.

The above diagram illustrates the formation and conduct of a 
jumping event. In view of the fact that ‘‘Number eight” of team 
“B” set a mark beyond the base line team “B” wins. 
Conduct of Throws. 
In these events the teams must compete in groups of two. Ar- 
range the two teams in lines on opposite ends of the field as in the 
jumping events, only, in this instance, farther apart ;—for the base- 
ball throw from seventy to one hundred yards, for the discus shot, 
medicine ball throw, and so on, shorter distances. Have each team 
count off consecutively. Establish a line a short distance in front 
of team “‘A”—this is the “Base line.” Give team ‘‘A”’ the object 
to be used. ‘Number one” of team “A” makes the prescribed 
throw from the base line, releasing the object behind the base 
line. ‘Number one” of team “B” throws back from the mark
-P-A-G-E-155
  
SHUTTLE METHOD 147 
made by number one of team “A”. ‘Number two” of team “A” 
then returns the throw from behind the mark made by “Number 
one” of team “‘B”, and so forth; the teams throw alternately and 
the players throw consecutively until all have thrown. Each throw 
must be made from in back of the mark established by the preced- 
ing thrower. If the last throw falls beyond the base line team 
“B” is the winner; if it falls short team “A” is the winner. 
General Method of Conduct. 
A meet consisting of two events from each of the three families 
of activity—two runs, two jumps, and two throws—gives a very 
satisfactory program. Regardless of the number of teams all may 
compete at one time in the running events; the jumps and throws 
on the other hand have to be conducted by the elimination method. 
To do this arrange the teams in pairs and determine the winners; 
arrange these winners in pairs and determine the winners. Con- 
tinue this elimination until the championship is decided. The team 
eliminated in the final round is given second place. The two teams 
eliminated in the semi-final round are matched to determine third 
and fourth place; the winner of this competition takes third place; 
the loser fourth. 
To save time the preliminaries, if there are any, should be 
run off simultaneously, the semi-final round the same way, and 
the competition to decide third and fourth places should be carried 
on while the finals are in session. Scoring should be on the basis 
of four points for first place, three for second, two for third, and 
one for fourth. 
Number of Teams. 
Because of the fact that places in the jumps and throws have to 
be determined by a program of elimination it is best to have the 
number of teams some square of two;—two, four or eight teams 
will suit most purposes. From six to twenty players may be used 
on a team. With the ordinary gymnasium class four teams of 
ten or twelve players each works out very well. If eight teams are 
used it is a good idea to have the four teams who lose in the first 
round compete in a consolation tournament. This may be carried 
on while the winners are carrying out the semi-finals and finals. 
Officials. 
For officials there should be one for each team; each acts as 
judge of the team he is assigned to. In the jumping and throwing 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  148 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
events where two teams compete against each other, as in the run- 
ning events where all compete at one time, each judges the per- 
formance of his own team. A meet of six events held with four 
teams of ten players each will take about forty minutes if efficiently 
handled. 
Scoring. 
The score for a meet of this sort may be easily chalked on the 
floor indoors, and outdoors a blackboard may be used or they may 
be scratched on the ground. The following table shows how the 
score may be kept. (Table IV.)

Use. 
Contests of this sort are also very popular for general informal 
recreation purposes. On the playground or during recess two 
groups of boys of ten or twelve players each will repeat a jumping 
or throwing contest six or eight times before tiring of it. One 
event of this sort introduced at the end of a physical training period 
is a very satisfactory method of closing the lesson.
-P-A-G-E-157
CuaptTer VII 
Cumulative Method 
The cumulative type of meet, characteristic of all relay contests, 
is exceedingly popular. The constant see-sawing back-and-forth 
as good and poor competitors forge to the front or fall in the rear 
makes this type of meet particularly interesting. The events used 
in a meet of this type may be classified in five groups: (1) runs, 
(2) jumps, (3) throws, (4) strength events and (5) accuracy 
events.

Conduct of Runs. 
The runs are conducted in the following manner:. Establish a 
circular track of the desired length (40, 60, 80 or 100 yds.). 
Distribute the teams about the track as evenly as possible. If there 
are two teams place them on opposite corners; if there are three, 
place them on three corners; four, place them on four corners; 
five, place four on the corners and one in the center of one side; 
and if there are six place four on the corners and two on opposite 
sides. The teams should take position well outside of the path 
in which the runners will travel; this is necessary to avoid inter- 
ference. Give the first player of each team a baton and place 
him on the track. 
At the signal the competitors with the batons advance about the 
track in the prescribed manner. After his departure the second 
runner takes position on the inside of the track. Upon completing 
a circuit of the track each runner passes the baton to the second 
player who repeats. This continues until all have run. The team 
finishing first wins. To determine the winners in this type of event 
the judge should stand outside of the track where he can see all of 
the finishing lines at a glance and thus by hasty observation decide 
the order in which the teams finish. 
The following diagram shows how six teams of ten men each 
should be arranged about an improvised track. (Dia. 32.) 
Conduct of Jumps. 
The jumps are conducted in the following manner. Allowing 
ten feet for each team establish a line long enough to accommodate 
all of the teams. This is the base line. Place the teams in columns 
ten feet apart in back of the base line. Any time after the signal 
to start is given the first player of each team executes the pre- 
scribed jump. The point nearest the base line touched by each 
jumper is marked. All of the number twos, using as a leaping 
point the heel mark of number one, execute the prescribed jump.

As before these jumps are marked. Number threes, fours, fives 
and the balance of each team compete in turn until all have jumped. 
Each team carries on its jumping independently. As the jumping 
mark moves forward each team moves forward always remaining 
just a trifle behind the mark. It is a good plan to have players 
who have jumped move on forward to the opposite side of the field. 
This prevents a good jumper from substituting for a poor one. 
The team jumping the greatest distance wins. Obviously the base 
line must be established along one side of the field so there is plenty 
of room in front for all to jump. 
Another method of carrying on these events, slightly different 
from the preceding, consists of having the same numbered players 
jump at the same time. That is, after the first player of each team 
jumps the instructor waits until all have been marked then he 
signals for the second player to jump. When these have been 
marked he signals for the third. And so on, this continues until 
all have jumped. This method is more interesting than the other. 
The relative positions of the teams can be noted at all times; com- 
petition is thus made keener. 
A competition in any of the jumping events would appear some- 
thing as follows: Six teams of six players toa team. (Dia. 33.)

In the above diagram team “E,” jumping the farthest, wins. 
Team ‘“‘C” captures second, team “A” third and team “‘D” fourth. 
Conduct of Throws. 
The throws are conducted in the same manner as the jumps. 
Establish a base line, allowing fifteen feet for each team. As in 
the jumping events this line must be established along one side of 
the field so there will be plenty of room in front for all of the 
throws. Place the teams in columns fifteen feet apart in back of 
the base line. At signal the first player of each team makes the 
prescribed throw. The object, varying with the event, should be 
released either from in back of the line or on the line. The point 
where the object breaks the ground is marked. Number two of 
each group, standing in back of or on the mark established by num-
-P-A-G-E-161
CUMULATIVE METHOD. 153 
ber one, repeats the throw. This throw is marked. The balance 
of each team compete in turn until all have thrown. After the first 
throw each team works independently. As the throwing mark 
moves forward each team moves forward, always remaining a few 
feet behind it. The team throwing the greatest distance wins. 
In some of the jumping and throwing events there is always a 
little trouble with contestants advancing over the jumping and 
throwing marks. A good way to handle this situation is to allow 
each contestant but one trial and penalize those who step over twice 
the distance they fouled. When the jumping and throwing events 
are carried on indoors chalk may be used to indicate the marks on 
the floor; when carried on outdoors a short stick may be used to 
scratch the ground or if it is sharpened it may be stuck in. 
Conduct of Strength Events. 
The strength events are conducted in the following manner: 
Place the teams in column. At signal have number one of each 
team make his effort. When these have finished the number twos 
begin. Instead of counting the scores of the second competitors 
from one, count them from the score reached by number one. For 
instance, number one of team “A” scores ten pull-ups when num- 
ber two starts the recorder counts eleven, twelve, thirteen, etc. 
This continues until all have competed. Or the score of each indi- 
vidual may be kept separately and then added. These scores may 
be chalked on the floor close by the place of competition. The 
teams scoring the highest total win. 
The following table shows how the strength events are scored. 
This particular case is of the pull-ups. Six teams; ten men on a 
team. (Table V.)

By virtue of making the greatest number of pull-ups team “D” 
gets first place. Team “B” gets second, Team “A” gets third and 
team “F”’ gets fourth. 
Conduct of Accuracy Events. 
The accuracy events are conducted in a similar manner. At 
signal number one of each team makes his trial. Numbers two, 
three, four and the rest follow in order until all have competed. 
The contestants may be given anywhere from one to ten trials as 
the instructor wishes. The number of successful throws are 
counted. The team scoring the highest number of successful throws 
wins. The scores may be kept on the floor as outlined for the 
strength events. 
Use. 
This sort of meet is especially well suited for use in connection 
with a gymnasium class or a playground group. A meet consist- 
ing of five events, one from each family, a run, a jump, a throw, a 
strength event, and an accuracy event proves to be very satisfac- 
tory. Any number of teams from two to eight may be used, and, 
under particularly favorable conditions, even twelve may be used— 
more than this though is quite unwieldy. As to the size of the teams 
any number from five to twenty may be handled—from eight to 
fifteen players to a team, in most cases gives the best results. Scor- 
ing may be done on the basis of five, four, three, two and one for 
first, second, third, fourth and fifth places respectively, or five, 
three and one for the first three or eight, four, two and one for the 
first four. For officials in conducting a meet of this kind it is 
necessary to have one judge for each team. The instructor acts as 
general director.

Elimination Method 
Next to a relay race perhaps the most popular type of competi- 
tion is an Elimination Contest. This is not a meeting of teams but 
purely an individual affair—each participates against all of the 
others.

Conduct of Distance Events. 
These several events in reality are of two types only—distance 
events and height events. The so-called distance events are con- 
155
-P-A-G-E-164
156 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
ducted after the following manner. Establish two parallel lines 
just so far apart that all of the contestants can execute the pre- 
scribed activity across the space between them with comparative 
ease. Outdoors two small ropes laid on the ground is a very satis- 
factory arrangement, or the ground may be scratched with a stick. 
In the gymnasium chalk may be used. For the jumps two mats 
placed in a parallel position is also a very satisfactory arrangement, 
—the space between the two mats is the gap to be covered. The 
space between the two lines varies for each event and for different 
groups. With a class of high school boys for instance they should 
be about eight feet apart for the running broad jump, five feet apart 
for the standing broad jump, one hundred feet apart for the base- 
ball throw, twenty feet apart for the (6 pound) medicine ball throw 
and so on. With grade school boys these distances in every case 
should be less; with college students and young men they should be 
greater. As a rule make the gap between the two lines for the 
first trial quite narrow so all of the contestants will be able to clear 
it successfully. 
Arrange the players in a column just back of one of the lines. 
At signal the players move forward each executing in turn the pre- 
scribed activity across the space between the two lines. Those 
who succeed return to the original column; those who fail are 
eliminated and withdraw to one side of the field. After all have 
made the attempt the space between the two lines is widened; to 
do this it is only necessary to move one of the lines. For the 
various events the lines are moved different distances; in the jumps 
and dives they should be moved from three to five inches, for the 
throws and boots from two to twenty feet, depending on the type 
of event used. After the new space has been established those 
players who remain in the column attempt to clear it again; those 
who fail are eliminated and withdraw; those who succeed return 
to the column. The space between the two lines is increased and 
the players, each in his turn, try again. In this manner the elifnina- 
tions continue until all have withdrawn; the last player eliminated is 
the winner. 
In view of the fact that as the space between the lines increases 
clearing it becomes more difficult, each successive widening should 
be for a shorter distance; for instance, in the standing broad jump 
the space may be increased six inches the first time, then succes- 
sively five inches, four inches, three, two and a half, two, one and a 
half, and thereafter one inch at a time. These figures, of course, 
are only approximate; the director in charge must judge as best  
-P-A-G-E-165
ELIMINATION METHOD 157 
he can how each situation should be met. The space should be 
widened so that eight or ten widenings will eliminate everyone. 
It is best to establish the ruling that one failure eliminates— 
this applies to both those who step over the near line or fall short 
of the far line. Another method of handling this consists of elim- 
inating a contestant after two successive failures. In this case 
after failing at one distance he returns to the column as those 
who succeed, and when the lines are moved again tries in his regu- 
lar turn; if he succeeds he returns to the column with his record 
clean; if he fails he is out of the competition for good. When 
using this latter method though the instructor should keep his eye 
“peeled” for those who are taking second trials. A class leader 
might be appointed to keep a check on them. 
The following diagram outlines in a general way how events in- 
volving extension are conducted. (Dia. 34.)

Conduct of Height Events. 
Those events which involve elevation rather than extension are 
conducted quite similarly. The players are placed in column along 
one side of the playing field; the bar, or rope, or kicking drum is 
placed at a height where everyone can easily execute the prescribed 
event. At signal the players, each in his turn, attempt the exercise; 
those who fail are eliminated and those who succeed return to the
-P-A-G-E-166
  158 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
original column. The bar, or rope, or drum is raised; those who 
remain in the column try again; those who succeed return to the 
column; those who fail are eliminated as before. As in the jumps, 
as the event becomes more difficult, the height is increased over 
shorter distances. The instructor should arrange to have all of 
the players eliminated after seven or eight elevations. In this 
manner the eliminations continue until all have been eliminated; 
the last player eliminated is the winner. 
The events may be carried on on the “one failure eliminates” 
basis, or the “‘two successive failures eliminates’ method may be 
used. For large classes of forty or more the first method is the 
best; for smaller classes either method is satisfactory. (Dia. 35.)

“Hot Water” Procedure. 
The conduct of a contest of this kind is very simple. Only one 
official is necessary—he acts as a referee and judge and assumes 
the general direction of the contest. To get the maximum amount 
of work out of the class the instructor should insist on the “hot 
water” method of participation—each player follows after the

  XXXXX

other in rapid succession—literally on one anothers heels. The 
referee stands at the point of contest and as the contestants try, 
calls “Out” or “O.K.” as each fails or succeeds. A playground 
leader or a gymnasium instructor may use six or eight events of 
various types for an hour program or a gymnasium instructor may 
use one or two events to close a program of several activities. 
Use. 
The writer has used practically all of the events listed in the 
first part of the chapter and can promise any one who tries them 
satisfactory results. The baseball throw, forward pass, playground 
ball throw, punt for distance, etc., similar long throws or kicks 
may be carried on on a football field. The goal line serves as the 
base line and the cross lines are used for far lines. When using 
these lines the instructor selects a line that is comparatively near 
and sticks a stake in it thus marking it for the contestants. The 
stake is successively moved to other cross lines after each rotation 
of the contestants. When using throwing events it is best to have 
a liberal supply of balls on hand so no time is wasted. (Dia. 36.)
-P-A-G-E-169
  CHAPTER IX 
Tournament Method 
This type of recreational activity is always popular. In view 
of the fact that the contestants work in pairs it becomes necessary 
for the sake of managerial efficiency to use only those events in 
which the contestant can make a measurable maximal effort in one 
attempt—the broad jumps, throws for distance, throws for ac- 
curacy, and so on. If such events as the high jump, high dive, bar 
vault and pole vault were used, each pair of contestants, under 
the most favorable conditions, ee have to make from five to 
fifteen trials each, with the result that if there were only thirty in 
the competition, it would take half an hour to work off the pre- 
liminaries. This kind of event is therefore too time-consuming for 
this particular type of meet. 
Events. 
While other events may be used the following will be found to 
be very practical:

Method of Conduct. 
To carry on a contest of this type arrange the contestants in 
pairs. At signal each pair in turn executes the prescribed activity. 
The losers are eliminated; the winners are rematched and at a 
signal each pair repeats the prescribed activity. The losers, as be- 
fore, are eliminated and the winners rematched. In this manner 
the matches continue until but one player remains; this player is 
the winner. 
Use. 
This type of a contest is not very well adapted for use with large 
numbers; neither is it so very well suited for use during an entire 
class program, although it may be used in this way. The best way to 
use this type of competition is at the close of a regular gymnasium 
class when a little recreation is wanted, or on the playground when 
a small group is available and a little activity is desired. On an 
occasion of this sort one or two events may be carried on. 
OUTLINE OF A HIGH SCHOOL MEET. 
For the sake of picturing a little more clearly how a meet of 
this kind is conducted I shall outline an actual case that came to 
my attention just recently. Two events were used just before 
the close of a gymnasium class of forty high school students— 
the three standing broad jumps and the medicine ball throw. By 
wasting no time between attempts both events were run off in less 
than ten minutes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
    TOURNAMENT METHOD 163 
Conduct of Broad Jumping. 
To conduct the three standing broad jump competition the 
students were arranged in a double line; the members of the front 
line standing at one foot intervals, the members of the back line 
covering off. The members of the front line were called “ones,” the 
members of the back line “twos.” Using the basketball free-throw 
line as a toe mark the first “one” executed his triple jump. The in- 
structor chalked his ‘‘mark” on the floor. The number “‘two”’ in back 
of him then jumped. If number “‘two’s” mark was short of that of 
number “‘one,” number “one” won; if it was beyond, number ‘‘two”’ 
won. In this manner all jumped—number “one’s” jumping first, 
number “two’s” trying to beat the marks established by them. 
Those who won were assembled at one side, those who lost were 
assembled in another place. 
When all had jumped the winners were reassembled in a double 
line as in the beginning. Those who had lost were permanently 
out of the competition. The competition was recommenced,—the 
winners were placed in a group and the losers eliminated. This 
continued until only five were left. The instructor reappointed 
two of these to jump again—the winner of this contest returned to 
the original line, the loser was eliminated. With four boys left,. 
the semi-finals and finals were duly conducted until the champion- 
ship was decided. 
Conduct of Throws. 
The medicine ball throw was then carried on in exactly the same 
way. The following diagram may aid the reader in getting a 
clearer conception of how the contest was carried on. (Dia. 37.)

Conduct of Runs. 
To conduct a running event, the group is arranged in pairs as 
previously outlined. Each pair runs the distance—the loser being 
eliminated. The winners are rematched and rematched until the 
champion has been determined. In view of the fact that those who 
are successful have to run the race several times, the distances 
should be comparatively short. 
Conduct of Other Events. 
In conducting the dives the scheme outlined for the jump is 
followed. The boots are conducted in the same general manner 
as the throws. In conducting the accuracy event the contestants 
compete in pairs; the player getting the low score in each case 
being eliminated. If only one rope or pole is available for con- 
ducting a climbing event each climbs against time and the slower 
is eliminated. If two ropes are available both contestants may 
climb at the same time and the slower is eliminated. 
Mass Performance. 
If space and equipment are available a lot of time may be saved 
and a lot more may be accomplished by having a number of con- 
tests carried on simultaneously. In the broad jumping event all 
of the pairs may carry on the performances at the same time— 
each pair decides for themselves who is the better man. One player 
jumps and sets his mark and the other tries to beat it. In the runs 
the pairs may be numbered off—the odd pairs start and judge the 
evens and then the two reverse. In the ball throws the number who 
may participate at the same time depends on the number of balls 
available. As soon as one pair is finished they pass the ball to the 
next. In the throws each contestant judges the other’s performance. 
If equipment is available the diving and accuracy events may be 
carried on in this way also. 
Unit Method of Organization. 
By dividing the class into two or four groups and then having 
group competition we have a slight variation of this method which 
in some ways is more popular than the straight tournament 
method. To use this method the class is divided into two or four 
groups of equal strength; each group determines its own champion 
and then these group champions are matched to determine the
-P-A-G-E-173
  TOURNAMENT METHOD 165 
class championship. If equipment and space are available the four 
preliminary championships may be held at the same time—the 
straight elimination method or the tournament elimination method 
being used. The instructor may keep the competition on a straight 
event basis, in which there is only an announcement of the event- 
champions; or if several events are used, by awarding four, two 
and one points for first, second and third places in each event and 
keeping the team scores he may make it a meet contest. 
Outline of an Army Meet. 
During the recent war I held a meet with a regiment of soldiers 
in which this method was very closely followed. Five events were 
used; the 15 yd. dash, the running broad jump, seven jumps, 
the shot put and the grenade throw. In the beginning each platoon 
carried on a separate meet of the tournament type to decide the 
platoon champion in each event. The platoon champions in each 
company in each event were then matched and company champions 
determined. The entire regiment was then assembled and the com- 
pany champions matched to decide the regimental championships. 
By this process of gradual elimination we finally determined the 
best performer in the regiment in six separate events. By match- 
ing the losers in the semi-finals it was possible to determine third 
and fourth places. Company scores were kept for the first four 
places; four, three, two and one were scored for first, second, third 
and fourth. In this way we also decided meet champions. 
By speeding up the work the entire meet was conducted in a 
little over two hours. The meet provided an excellent afternoon’s 
recreation and a considerable amount of exercise, and from every 
angle was a decided success. Having decided so many champion- 
ships—squad, platoon, company and regiment—by the time we 
were through almost every one who took part was champion of 
something. 
Outline of a University Gymnasium Class Meet. 
A meet of this sort carried on in connection with one of the 
gymnasium classes at the University of Illinois was conducted as 
follows. There were sixty students in the class. The students 
were placed in a circle about the instructor who demonstrated the 
six events to be used,—the standing sideward jump, the standing 
backward jump, the standing forward step and the standing side- 
ward step, the standing forward jump, and the standing broad hop.  
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
The students were then placed in line and counted off by fours; 
ones constituted one team, twos another team, threes another and 
fours another. -A captain was appointed for each team with the 
instruction to determine the best performer in each event,—each 
contestant to be given two trials at each event and the winner 
selected. Each captain was given a piece of chalk and directed 
to take his team to a designated corner of the gymnasium. The 
four teams repaired to the four corners of the gymnasium where 
each decided its winner in each event. When this was finished the 
four teams were brought to the center of the gymnasium. Here 
each team was kept in a compact group. The order of competition 
was announced to be (1) “Ones vs. Twos, (2) Threes vs. Fours, 
(3) the two losers, (4) and the two winners; the same order to 
be used for all of the events. 
The method of procedure in conducting the events was as fol- 
lows. The representative of team one executed the standing side- 
ward jump; the representative of team two attempted to beat num- 
ber one’s mark. He was given but one trial. If he failed the rep- 
resentative of team one won. If he succeeded in beating the-record 
of the representative of team one his mark was chalked on the 
floor and the representative of team one was given a try at beating 
the record of the representative of team two. If he failed number 
two won. If he succeeded in beating the other’s mark the repre- 
sentative of team two was given a try at beating it. This con- 
tinued until one player failed to tie or beat a jump made by his 
opponent; the contestant making the unsurpassed jump won. The 
representatives of teams three and four carried out a similar per- 
formance. The two losers competed to determine third and fourth 
places and then the two winners competed to determine first and 
second places. 
All six events were executed in this manner. Four points, three 
points, two points and one point were awarded for the four places. 
The scores were chalked on the floor where all could see them. 
The meet lasted about fifty minutes and was very successful.

CHAPTER X 
Rank Method 
This type of a meet is fairly popular with boys. Like the relay 
meet it may be very loosely organized or it may be well organized 
and carried on on a comparatively high plane; and then again, but 
one event may be used at the close of a gym class, or an entire 
period may be devoted to two, three or four events depending on 
the type of events used. Strictly speaking, however, while a meet 
of several events may be conducted, scoring is so complicated and 
so irregular that it is more satisfactory to classify the teams by 
events only. Whether several events are used or only one event is 
used, this type of meet is better adapted to small numbers than 
large numbers. Forty should be the maximum but twenty or thirty 
is better.

Ranking Principle. 
The principle used in ranking the contestants in this type of 
meet is the same as that used in ranking the performers in a 
Cross Country race. In conducting a meet of this sort it is found 
impractical to rank the players according to their exact record. 
There would be too many ranks, the scores would be too large 
and there would be too much figuring for practical purposes. In 
many events there would be a rank for each individual competing. 
It is better to arrange scoring ranks so there will never be over 
fifteen ranks—ten would be even better. The scoring ranks shown 
in connection with the list of events which may be used in a meet 
of this type will be found quite satisfactory.
-P-A-G-E-177
  RANK METHOD 169 
Use of Ranks. 
The scoring ranks are used in the following manner. In the 
100 yard dash, for instance, the time of the best runner is accepted 
as the standard. Suppose this is 12°. All those who run better 
than 13 seconds form the first rank. There may be two or three 
whose time is 12° and four or five more whose time is 124; all 
nevertheless form the first rank. All those who run under 14 sec- 
onds form the second; there may be six who run the race in 13}, 
eight who run it in 13°, seven who run it in 13°, four in 13', and 
three in 13 flat. All those who run better than 15 seconds form 
the third rank. And so on until all are ranked. It will be noted 
that in this event it is quite likely with the average class there will 
not be more than four or five ranks. 
In the 440 yard run, on the other hand, two second intervals are 
used. The scoring ranks are established on the even numbers. 
Let us say that the best runner’s time was 64”. All runners doing 
better than 66 would fall in the first rank. All those doing be- 
tween 66 and 67% inclusive fall in the second rank. And so on. 
In the running broad jump six inch intervals are used. In this 
event the scoring ranks are established on the foot and half-foot 
marks. Let us say that the best jump is 18 feet 3 inches. In 
this case all those jumping 18 feet or over would drop in the first 
rank; those who jump 17 ft. 6 ins. or over would fall in the second 
rank. Those over 17 ft. in the third. And so on until all are 
ranked. 
In the baseball far throw ten yard intervals are used. In this 
case the scoring ranks are on the ten yard marks. If the best 
throw is 82 yards all those throwing 80 yards or better form the 
first rank. Those throwing 70 yards or better form the second. 
And so on. 
In the basketball accuracy throw each score is used for a rank. 
If the best record is seven, all those who have seven form the 
first rank, those who throw six form the second and so on. Those 
who score nothing fall in the last rank. 
In events involving height measurement it is best to start the bar 
at a low level and then raise it by the intervals indicated. In the 
standing high jump for instance it might be started at 2 ft. 6 ins. and 
raised by 2 inch elevations; and in the running high jump it might 
be started at 3 ft. and then raised successively to 3 ft. 3 ins., 3 ft. 
6 ins., 3 ft. 9 ins., and so on. 
Also for the purpose of saving time when events involving height
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 © INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
measurements (high jumps, high dives, vaults, high kicks) are 
used the contestants should be limited to one attempt at each 
height. The practice of allowing a competitor to try a succeeding 
height after failing has proven successful. For instance in the 
Running High Jump a contestant fails at 4 ft. 2 ins. After all have 
made their attempts the bar is raised to 4 ft. 4 ins. The contestant 
who failed at 4 ft. 2 ins. is allowed to attempt the new height. If 
he succeeds in clearing the bar he is given credit for that height, 
and may continue in the competition; if he fails he is eliminated 
from further competition. In this way the fault of giving the con- 
testant but one trial at a height is partially corrected. 
How to Rank Contestants. 
To rank the players after completing an event the instructor 
places the contestants in line, finds the best record, and calls out 
for those who are entitled to the first rank. He places these in a 
column. He then calls for those who are entitled to the second 
rank, then the third and fourth and so on to the end, placing each 
group in a separate column until all have been ranked. If it 
happens that there are no candidates in a given rank the instructor 
calls for the next rank and places them in the succeeding rank 
anyway. For instance, in the running broad dive the instructor 
has one man in the first rank with a record of 12 feet.- He calls 
for dives over 11 ft. 6 ins. There are none. He calls for dives 
over 11 feet. There are three—all three go into the second 
rank. If there had been a man who dived 11 ft. 8 ins. he would 
have occupied the second rank and these last three men would have 
occupied the third rank instead. 
Each member in a rank scores as many points as the number of 
his rank. By way of illustration we have the following ranking 
of a running high jump—two teams competing—15 men on a team. 
(Dia. 38.) 
In the first rank team “A” scores one point. In the second rank 
team “A” scores 4 points—2 x 2; team “‘B” 2 points. In the third 
rank team ‘‘A” scores 6 points—2 x 3; team “‘B” 12 points—4 x 3. 
In the fourth rank team “A” scores 12 points—3 x 4; “B” 24 
points—6 x 4. Andsoon. The total score of all of the members 
of a team is that team’s score. In view of the fact that better per- 
formances get smaller scores the teams are rated according to the 
lowness of the scores. In this particular case the final score is team

As stated before this sort of a meet is better adapted to small 
numbers. While three or four or five teams may be used it seems 
to work out better if but two teams are used. 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL MEET. 
Possibly the best way to indicate how a meet of this type may be 
carried on is to outline a meet actually carried on with a gym- 
nasium class of twenty-two Junior High School boys. The class 
was divided into two teams of eleven players each. The events 
used were the standing broad jump, the medicine ball throw (free 
style), the pull-ups, the running broad dive, one lap about the 
track and the bar snap for distance. 
Each event was conducted separately. The contestants were 
given but one trial in each event. After each event was com- 
pleted the contestants were lined up according to the record of 
performance and each team’s score taken. In the standing broad  
-P-A-G-E-180

jump for instance they lined up something as follows. Ranks 
were established on the two-inch basis. (Dia. 39.)

DIAGRAM 39 
Each individual scored points according to the place he occupied 
in the alignment. The man who jumped 7 ft. 10 ins. for instance 
scored one point; each man who jumped between 7 ft. 8 ins. and 
7 ft. 10 ins. scored two points; each one who jumped between 7 ft. 
6 ins. and 7 ft. 8 ins. scored three points, and so on. In the above 
event team “A” scored 64 points and team ‘“‘B” scored 77 points— 
team “A” having the lower score won. 
In the medicine ball throw full yards was used as the basis for 
ranking. They lined up something as follows. (Dia. 40.)

In this event the scores were team “A” 34 points; team “B” 31

In the one lap run about the track only full seconds were 
recorded. A boy who ran around in 12‘ received the same rank 
as one who ran 12' or 12. They lined up something as follows.

In this event the scores were team “A” 34 points; team “B” 31

In this way the several events were carried out andl scored. At 
the close each team’s event scores were added. The scores were 
something as follows, (Table VI.)

Team ‘“‘A” having the lowest score won. The event scores were 
kept on the floor in chalk so they could be readily referred to by 
the contestants. It required an hour’s time to complete the meet. 
About half of the time was spent in determining ranks and com- 
puting scores. Owing to the fact that so much time is wasted in 
collecting these figures it is better to use this method only occasion- 
ally. Other methods that are more efficient should occupy the bulk 
of the program.
-P-A-G-E-182
  CuHaPTER XI 
Zone Method 
The zone method in actual fact is a modification of the point 
method. The difference between the two methods is found in the 
method of conduct and recording; in the point method each per- 
formance is measured and points awarded accordingly; in the zone 
method the possibilities of performance are charted off in zones 
and a competitor’s performances are automatically evaluated. 
While it is possible to use three, four, six, eight, or ten zones in a 
meet of this type, and in some cases it may be wise to use one of 
these arrangements, in most instances the five zone arrangement is 
the most popular and practical. 
In view of the fact that in the zone method only five zones are 
used and consequently the range of scoring is only five points 
while in the point method the scoring range is anywhere from ten 
to a thousand points, the first method, when compared to the 
second, is quite inaccurate. In the standing broad jump, for in- 
stance, by the zone method, a leap of seven feet scores two points 
and a leap of seven feet five inches scores but two points also, these 
same leaps if scored by the point method on the basis of a hun- 
dred would score twenty points and thirty points respectively, and 
if scored on the basis of a thousand would score two hundred and 
three hundred points respectively. 
This type of a meet (the zone method), however, is exceedingly 
well adapted to the handling of large numbers; it provides for 
very rapid action, it simplifies the scoring problem, and for in- 
formal purposes is very satisfactory. For this reason it is used 
much more than the point method. 
Events. 
Any of the events included in the official list of track and field 
events may be used in a meet of this kind, and if the equipment is 
available any of the special events outlined in this manuscript may 
be used also. The following events are well adapted to a meet 
of this kind.

Zones Suggested Herewith. 
To give the very best results zones should be arranged to meet 
the particular abilities of each group. To give the uninitiated a 
working plan, however, a few typical schemes arranged to meet 
typical groups have been arranged and are submitted herewith. 
These plans are adapted for use with four main groups which 
take part in athletic competition—adults (including college stu- 
dents, soldiers, and sailors), senior high school boys, junior high 
school boys, and grade school boys. These zones are arranged 
for the general mass rather than for athletes. In an average 
class practically everyone can score at least one point and there 
will be one or two who will be able to score five—the bulk will 
score two, three and four points. 
Conduct of Runs. 
Any running event may be carrried on by the zone method. To 
"conduct an event according to this method establish the starting 
and finish line the desired distance apart on the track and then 
make four other lines at intervals of one twentieth of the distance 
of the race—establishing these successively from the finish line 
toward the starting line. Counting from the starting line the zones 
between these five lines are called the 1 point, 2 point, 3 point, and 
4 point zones respectively. The area in front of the finish line is 
the 5 point zone. In the 40 yard dash, for instance, we would have 
the following arrangement. (Dia. 42.)

Starting Line Finish Line 
DIAGRAM 42 
Then determine or estimate the time which is required, by the 
best performer of the group taking part, to negotiate the run—this 
is established as the base time. To get a contestant’s score, a timer, 
holding a stopwatch, stands beside the finish line. A judge stands 
alongside of the finish lines. A starter starts a runner in the usual 
way. On the signal ‘“‘Go” the timer starts his watch. On the ex- 
piration of the base time he calls “Time.” The judge notes the 
zone the runner was in at the moment ‘‘Time” was called. The 
evaluation given this zone represents his score. If the contestant 
was breasting the 2 point zone he receives two points; if he was 
beyond the finish line, no matter how far beyond, he receives five 
points; if he had not yet crossed the 1 point line he scores nothing. 
By appointing one judge for each contestant running more than 
one contestant may run at a time. Each judge is assigned to watch 
a certain runner and determine what zone he is in at the moment 
time is called. 
The zones and base times for a few of the races that can be 
carried on in this way are as follows:

I point zone— 4o yds Grade School 7-2/5 sec.

  ZONE METHOD 177 
Conduct of Broad Jumps. 
In the broad jumps the zones are established in front of the 
take-off. This is done by establishing five lines parallel to the take- 
off at the desired distance. Counting from the take-off the intervals 
between the successive lines are, respectively, 1 point zone, 2 point 
zone, 3 point zone and 4 point zone. The area beyond the fifth 
line is the 5 point zone. Any contestant who fails to jump over the 
first line scores nothing; and no matter how far a contestant jumps 
over the last line his score in only five points. The following 
diagram of the standing broad jump for college students outlines 
how these zones are marked out. (Dia. 43.)

In the high jumps five zones are used as in the other events. To 
conduct the event the bar is placed at the height marking the one 
point zone; all make the attempt to clear it; those who succeed 
remain in the competition; those who fail are eliminated and score

nothing. The bar is then raised to the height marking the two 
point zone. Those who are still in the competition attempt the 
new height; those who fail are eliminated and score one point: 
those who succeed are still in the competition. In this way the 
competition continues until all have been eliminated or the fifth 
height has been concluded. Starting at the lowest height the zones 
score one, two, three, four and five points, respectively. By way

as the jumping for height events. Zones for the three main gym- 
nasium groups in the two events used are as follows:

Conduct of Kicking Events. 
Five zones are used in these events as in the others. The drum 
is placed at the lowest height and then successively raised to the 
other heights until all have been eliminated or the highest zone has 
been reached. Probable zones .for two representative events for 
the three normal groups are as follows:

Conduct of Vaults. 
The high vaulting events are carried on in the same general way 
as the high jumping events. The bar is successively placed at the 
five heights marking the pre-established zones. As each contestant 
fails at a given height he is given credit for the zone below and 
is eliminated from further competition. The zones for the three 
main groups in two representative events are as follows:

In the throws and puts a throwing line and five parallel lines to 
mark off the zones are established. Counting from the throwing 
line the intervals between the successive lines score one point, two 
points, three points and four points. The area beyond the last 
line scores five points and inside of the first line scores nothing.

Conduct of Strength Events. 
In the strength events five definite zones of performance are 
established according to the ability of the various groups. The 
contestants score is determined by the place his record fits into the 
scoring zones. The zones for the pull-ups for adults for instance 
are as follows: 4, 7, 10, 13, 16. If a contestant’s record is 4, 5 
or 6 his score is one; if his record is 7, 8 or 9 his score is two; and 
so on. If a contestant’s record is less than 4 he scores nothing. 
On the other hand a contestant’s record may be 16, 18, 20 or 25 
yet he scores only five points. The following events giving the 
zones for the main groups are representative of the way these 
events may be zoned.

Conduct of Accuracy Events. 
In the accuracy events zones of performance like those used in 
the strength events are established. ‘The contestant’s score is de- 
termined according to where his record fits into the zoning arrange- 
ment. The following events with zones for the four main groups 
found in our gymnasiums indicate how this system is used.

Physical Efficiency. 
The zone method in a general way may be used to determine 
individual physical efficiency. When used in this way each com- 
petitor attempts all of the events and the total of all of his scores is 
his final score. The contestants are then ranked according to their 
total scores; the highest scorer, of course, ranking first and the low- 
est scorer ranking last. When this is done it is a good idea to estab- 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
184 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS ' 
lish the average score and those who lie above this score are con- 
sidered “above the average” and those who fall below are “below 
the average. ” Being faster and more simple in organization than 
the point method, the zone method is more practical than the 
point method in determining relative physical efficiency. On the 
other hand, as pointed out before, it is not nearly so accurate. 
Five, ten or twenty events might be used in a competition of this 
kind. Events recommended for each’ of these are as follows. (It 
should be remembered that these recommendations are for general 
classes not regular athletes.)

Team Competition. 
The zone method may be also used very successfully in team 
competition. When used in this way the total score of each team 
in each event is taken; the grand total of each team’s score in all 
events represents its final score. The teams thus may be ranked 
according to event places and finally meet places. 
COLLEGE GYM CLASS MEET. 
A meet of this type may be very effectively carried on with a 
gymnasium class during the regular class period. For the purpose 
of giving the reader a thorough understanding of how this may 
be done I shall outline a meet carried on with a college gymnasium 
class of eighty students. 
To begin five of the most competent and most reliable students 
were selected to act as judges; each was given a piece of chalk for 
scoring. The balance of the class was divided into five teams of 
fifteen players each. The events used were (1) the standing
-P-A-G-E-193
  ZONE METHOD 185 
broad jump, (2) the medicine ball throw (between the legs), (3) 
the running broad dive, (4) the standing hop, step and jump, (5) 
one lap about the track, and (6) the pull-ups. Before class the 
floor and mats had been marked out with chalk in zones for those 
events which required them; in this particular case this was done 
for five events, all but the pull-ups. Four zone areas were marked 
out on the floor for the throws and jumps. The zones for the 
running event were marked on the track. For the pull-ups the zones 
were chalked on the floor in figures. With the exception of the 
running event, the teams participated in each event at the same 
time so there had to be five sets of zones for each. 
For the first event, which was the standing broad jump, the 
teams were arranged in separate columns behind the take-off. A 
judge was assigned to each team and immediately took a position to 
the left of the zones for his group. The instructor gave the signal 
to begin. The first member of each team jumped. Each judge 
noted the zone his man landed in (heel mark), and chalked the 
score made by the jumper on the floor to one side of the zone 
marks. Immediately after jumping each contestant took a position 
behind the end line—this was done to prevent a good jumper from 
taking a position in the column and jumping again. Each competi- 
tor jumped in turn; the judges marking the score made by each on 
the floor. After the signal to start had been given the teams worked 
independently of each other. When all had jumped each team’s 
score was added by the judge. The scores for this event were some- 
thing as follows. (Table VII.)

The instructor then announced the places secured by the teams 
according to their scores—the team scoring the highest number

of points were ‘awarded first place, the team scoring the lowest 
number of points fifth place. 
The following diagram pictures in a crude way how the floor was 
marked and where the judges and contestants stood for the stand-

  ZONE METHOD 187 
To carry on the pull-ups event the teams were taken to several 
places in the gymnasium. Two teams worked on the horizontal 
bar and three worked on the horizontal ladder. Each judge 
scored each member of his team as before and added up the total 
points. 
To carry on the one lap run all five teams were taken to the run- 
ning track. In view of the fact that the track was 117 yards around 
the zone spaces were established with 5 yard intervals. The start- 
ing line was used as the finish line so these were established im- 
mediately adjacent thereto as shown in the attached diagram. 
(Dia. 47-) Fifteen seconds had been previously established as the base time. 
One runner from each team was placed at the starting line. The 
instructor acted as starter and timer. Each judge acted as judge 
for the players of his team. Each kept a separate score on the 
edge of the track. Thus the players ran in groups of five, one 
from each team, until all had run. 
Team scores were kept on the floor in a scoring chart as follows.

By having the zones marked out before the meet started and all 
of the equipment ready for distribution the meet was completed in 
about an hour. Each contestant was given but one trial at each 
event. This partially accounts for the low scores which were 
made. Under normal conditions each team should average 45 
points in each event. This is figured on the basis of the three point 
zone representing a median performance;—15 performers, three 
points each, totals 45 points. :

Another Method of Organization. 
Another method of conducting a meet of this sort with a gym- 
nasium class is as follows: Establish zones or a place of competi- 
tion for each of the events—only one for each, as shown in the 
accompanying diagram. (Dia. 48.)

Arrange the class in teams and place one team at each of these 
places; by way of example one team would be at the high jump, 
another at the standing broad jump, another at the push-ups, an- 
other at the running broad dive, and perhaps another on the track. 
There should be one judge for each event. At signal each team 
starts its competition. When all have finished the teams rotate to 
the scene of the next event. Each team’s score is chalked on the 
floor or it may be kept on a pad. When all have competed at each 
event the scores are assembled and totaled as before. Places are 
awarded according to scores.

Point Method 
The Point system of carrying on a mass athletic meet is especially 
popular in indoor meets. There is no reason, however, why it 
might not be applied equally well to outdoor activities. This sys- 
tem is based on the principle of a definite percentage value for all 
degrees of performing ability. These percentage values are secured 
by the arbitrary means of translating performing units into per- 
centage units. Charts made out by different individuals or differ- 
ent organizations use different bases—the most popular, however, 
are ten, one hundred and one thousand. A record performance 
is considered as perfect and equal to a score of 10, 100 or 1,000. 
A very poor performance is rated at nothing. Other performances 
are then prorated. In view of the fact that a thousand points 
offers a greater range for scoring and thus performances can be 
more accurately translated into scoring values than when a smaller 
scale is used, the thousand point scale is preferred when very 
accurate data is wanted; the smaller scales are useful when approxi- 
mate figures suffice. 
Three Principles of Scoring Used. 
The scoring arrangements in charts of this sort follow three dif- 
ferent principles: (1) All portions of performance have the same 
value; (2) As the performance improves the value of a given por- 
tion increases; (3) Increased value is given within the range of 
average performance. 
Constant Values. 
Most scoring systems are so arranged that definite measure- 
ments of time or space give definite proportions of the total score. 
For instance, using the thousand as a basis, in the 100 yard 
dash, the world’s record of 9 3/5 seconds nets a perfect score of 
a thousand, a run of 13 3/5 seconds scores zero, therefore, in 
view of the fact that there are forty tenth-of-a-second intervals 
189 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
between the upper and lower registers each tenth of a second has 
a 25-point value. Similarly, in the running broad jump, a jump 
of 25 feet scores a thousand, a jump of 8 ft. 4 ins. scores nothing; 
inasmuch as there are 200 one-inch intervals between the two 
extremes, each inch has a 5-point value. 
The particular value in this type of scoring arrangement is to 
be found in the fact of its utter simplicity. They may be readily 
organized to suit any situation and they are readily interpreted and 
understood. 
Augmented Values. 
In the second type of scoring system a given portion of per- 
formance is given comparatively little credit in the lower section 
of the scale and gradually given increased credit until the top 
section is reached. In the running broad jump for college 
students, for instance, 11 feet may give two points and 12 feet 
may give six points; in other words, four points would be given 
for an increase of a foot. Six points may be given for the next 
increase of a foot, ten for the next and so on until we reach 19 
and 20 feet when twenty points are awarded for the increase 
of a foot. The same procedure is followed in the 100 yard dash; 
two points are awarded for an increase from 14 to 13 4/5 seconds 
while twenty points are awarded for an increase from 10 4/5 sec- 
onds to 102/5 seconds. The following table outlines the plan 
clearly.

In a way this is a fairer basis of computation than any other. 
It is comparatively easy for the normal adult to increase a record 
jump from 11 feet to 12 feet, but it is much more difficult to in- 
crease a record jump from 19 feet to 20 feet. It is argued there- 
fore that more credit should be given in the second instance than 
in the first. 
Increased Value in Range of Average Performance. 
The system of scoring used in the Detroit public schools 
illustrates the third method. In their scale which is drawn up for
-P-A-G-E-199
    
POINT METHOD 191 
grade school boys they follow the principle of giving increased 
credit within the average range of performance and comparatively 
little credit for increase in the upper and lower levels of perform- 
ance. In the running broad jump for instance, ten points is given 
for an increase from 8 ft. to 8 ft. 4 ins., 100 points is given for an 
increase from 11 ft. to 11 ft. 6 ins., and Io points is given for an 
increase from 14 ft. to 14 ft. 6 ins. In the 100 yard dash an in- 
crease from 14 4/5 to 14 3/5 nets Io points, an increase from 13 
to 12 4/5 nets 100 points, and an increase from 11 4/5 to 11 3/5 
nets 10 points. In both cases graduated increases are scaled be- 
tween. 
The purpose of this scale is to encourage the average boy to 
improve his performance in those events which he does rather 
poorly rather than attempt to develop special skill in one or two 
events which he already does well. By awarding a comparatively 
small number of points for improvement in the upper levels of 
performance and a relatively large number of points in the great 
middle section this result is readily insured. All-around skill rather 
than specialized skill is thus emphasized. 
Charts for Special Groups. 
Some scoring systems are worked out for use with special 
groups and others are worked out for universal usage. The chart 
used by the southern branch of the University of California is 
illustrative of the first type. This is arranged for college students 
and includes four events. It uses a scoring basis of twenty— 
that is the maximum number of points that a contestant may 
get in any one event is twenty. The scale is arranged so that 
the very poorest performances will net at least one or two points 
while a good performance will net the maximum. The maximum 
is set well below the record. In the running broad jump, for 
instance, 12 feet scores one point and 17 ft. 8 ins. scores 
twenty points; in the 100 yd. dash 15 seconds scores one 
point and rr seconds scores twenty points. The scale thus covers 
the range of the average adult group—it is not arranged for the 
super-athletic type, and cannot be used with the high school or 
grade school boy. 
Chart for Universal Use. 
The Universal Scoring Chart compiled by George A. Sellar 
represents the other type. In this chart which covers seventy-two  
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  192 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
different athletic events including running of different distances, 
jumping, vaulting, rope skipping, etc., 100 points is used as the 
basis and the range covers the performance of the junior high 
school boy through to the college student. In the running broad 
jump, for instance, 7 ft. 10 ins. scores one point while 20 feet 
scores 100 points; in the 100 yd. dash 15 2/5 seconds scores 
I point and 10 2/5 seconds scores 100 points. ‘Thus the seventh 
grader, the high school boy, the college student, the high school 
girl and the college woman could all be scored by this chart. 
The question naturally arises, which of these methods of scoring 
is the best? This is impossible to answer in any arbitrary way. 
Each individual should work out his own system to meet his own 
local needs. Personally I have used only the first method, that 
of giving a definite amount of credit for a definite portion of per- 
formance mainly because of its sheer simplicity. It is the easiest 
to compute and thus falls in line with the idea that the less time 
spent on incidentals the more time there will be for essentials— 
which in this case means more time for promotion and leadership. 
Methods of Organization. 
There are several methods of organizing a meet of this kind. 
(1) When the meet is by teams a very common practice is to 
have each contestant of each team try each event then total the 
scores of a given number of men (ten-fifteen, etc.) who have the 
highest scores. This represents one team’s score for one event. 
This is repeated with all of the events. The grand total or the 
total score of the ten highest contestants in all of the events is a 
team’s score. Places are awarded according to the total points 
scored by each team. : 
(2) Another method of team competition is to have each player 
of each team compete in each event. A team’s score in each event 
is the total of its individual scores divided by the number of its 
contestants; i.c., its average. The final score is the total of its 
event-scores. As in the first method places are awarded according 
to the total scores. 
(3) More popular than either of the above methods is the 
individual or all-around championship method. In this method 
each contestant takes part in all of the events; places, of course, 
are awarded on the basis of each competitor’s total points.
-P-A-G-E-201
  POINT METHOD 193 
Single Session Meet. 
It is possible to run off a meet of this kind at one meeting if 
contestants and events are reasonably limited (thirty or forty 
contestants and three or four events), and the formal regulations 
are somewhat modified. A meet of this kind, while conducted in 
the same manner, may have either of two ends, or both in view. 
It may be what we call an individual meet in which the contestants 
compete independently and are placed in rank according to the 
total points each scores. It may be a team competition in which 
two or more teams compete and the teams are ranked according 
to their total points. Or, as is quite obvious, the meet. may be 
conducted with both ends in view. 
In view of the fact that time is limited when the meet is com- 
pleted in one session it is necessary to confine the completion to 
those events in which the contestant can make a measurable maxi- 
mum effort on each trial. Time consuming events such as the high 
jump, high dive, pole vault, etc., are thus eliminated. Further, it 
may be found advisable, depending on the number competing, to 
limit the number of trials for each contestant to one, two, or 
three. Appoint a judge or a recorder for each event. Give each 
individual a card with the events listed on it and spaces for record- 
ing the marks and points made by the competitor. A card made 
according to the following diagram served this purpose well. 
(Table 1X.)

If teams are competing have each enter the name of the team 
on his card. In either case number the players off consecutively 
and have each contestant put down his number. All likewise enter 
their names. At signal the contestants move about to the various  
-P-A-G-E-202
  194 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
judges in turn according to their number and the order of events 
listed on their card. Each contestant should be asked to shift as 
rapidly as possible. The competitors move about something 
after the following manner: No 1 runs over to the scene of his 
first event (the Standing Broad Jump), hands his card to the 
recorder and takes his three jumps each of which is recorded. 
No. 2 takes his place at the jumping pit. In this way each con- 
testant moves about until he has completed everything. . On finish- 
ing the last event each contestant hands his card to the scorer 
who, using the scoring chart, inserts the points, totals the whole 
and gives the card back to the owner. 
When all have finished line them up according to score and 
number them according to position. If teams are competing have 
the teams form in separate lines; then using a blackboard or the 
floor totals the points of each and announce the winner. In either 
case it is a good idea to give the cards to the contestants for 
souvenirs. 
Another method of handling this type of a meet consists of 
supplying each judge with a score sheet on which he records all 
performances. At the finish each judge, referring to the per- 
centile chart, translates the performances into points. Each indi- 
vidual’s record is then assembled from the several score sheets 
and the final scores announced. Record sheets of this sort, if 
posted, would provide considerable interesting discussion. 
Outline of Young Men’s Meet. 
Better than the above method perhaps is the so-called all-around 
plan in which ten or twenty events are used and every one takes 
part, each individual attempting to make as high a score as pos- 
sible. For the purpose of illustrating how a contest of this sort 
can be conducted I shall outline one that was conducted at the 
Holyoke Y. M. C. A. during the winter of 1916. It was carried 
on with the Young Men’s class; about thirty contestants took part. 
The class period ran from 8: 15 to 9:30. The first thirty minutes 
was given over to calisthenics and gymnastic dancing; the balance 
of the period was devoted to athletic competition. Twenty events 
were used; to comply with our purpose of making our meet all- 
around our list of events was made as diverse as possible. 
The following events were used: 100 yd. run, 440 yd. run, 1 mile 
run, potato race (8 potatoes), Shot put (12-Ilb.), Med. Ball throw 
(between legs), Med. Ball throw (one arm), B. B. Free throws 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  POINT METHOD 195 
(10 throws), Goal shooting for speed (1 minute), Rope Climb 
(18-ft.), Running High jump, Running Broad jump, Standing 
Hop, Step and Jump, Running High Dive, Running High Kick 
(free style), Rope skip (1 minute free style), Bar Vault, Bar 
Snap for distance, Pull-ups, and Floor dips. Two events were 
performed each night. 
In view of the fact that the class met only two times a week 
for this purpose the meet lasted over a month. For the purpose 
of avoiding the effects of fatigue the two events used each night 
were always of a distinctly different type. Further, the plan was fol- 
lowed of using only one energy consuming event each night and this 
was always conducted last. The date on which each event was . 
to be conducted was posted, thus affording the contestants oppor- 
tunity to practice them beforehand. Usually, after executing the 
events for one evening they would practice those to be used at 
the succeeding meeting. The instructor and two leaders selected 
by him, did all of the judging. After the date of the last meet 
one additional evening was set aside for the purpose of allowing 
those who had missed a few of the events to make them up. In 
every way the meet was very satisfactory. One record was made 
in this meet that I have never seen approached—66 Floor dips, 
and by a man past forty years of age. 
A percentile chart and a record sheet, which was kept up to 
date, were posted and these helped maintain a lively interest. The 
record sheet used was as follows. (Table X.)

Group Method 
This method of conduct is frequently called the mass method, 
but in view of the fact that it is a separate and distinct method 
it is felt that it deserves a separate title, hence, the group method. 
Besides, by giving it a separate title our terminology is made 
clearer and there is lessened possibilities of misunderstanding. 
In connection with the modern tendency to extend the athletic 
program so it includes the whole group rather than the selected 
few, this method of competition is receiving increased attention. 
It has assumed many forms in the colleges, Y. M. C. A.’s, high 
schools, grade schools and playgrounds where it has been used, 
but in general procedure and method of organization the central 
idea of having the entire group or a large part of it actively 
represented in the scoring has been followed. 
The one element that features this method of competition is 
that the records of each member of a team, or a large proportion 
of them, are taken and converted into a total or an average; this 
figure represents the team record, and places are awarded accord- 
ing to team performances rather than individual performances. 
In some cases the records of each member of each group com- 
peting are included in the computation. In many instances eighty 
per cent (the best performances) of each unit competing are used. 
Sixty per cent and fifty per cent have also been used. In other 
cases, such as in the Y. M. C. A. Hexathlon, a stipulated number 
(usually quite small—five or ten) of the best performances are 
used. In all cases, however, the principle of using group scores 
-is followed. 
The cumulative, shuttle, rank, and zone methods are of course 
of the group type in that the performances of the entire group 
enter into the records but the methods of computation are differ- 
ent. In the straight group method individual performances are 
recorded and then totalled or averaged. 
This method of competition, it is true, is not so spectacular as 
some of the other methods but it has the advantage of getting 
196
-P-A-G-E-205
GROUP METHOD 197 
mediocre and poor performers into competition and mayhap instill 
interests in athletics where they did not exist before. 
In view of the fact that meets of this sort are conducted under 
all sorts of conditions it is practically impossible to select a few 
and set them up as being the most desirable—any measurable in- 
dividual athletic event may be used. The amount of time, equip- 
ment, number of contestants, place, conditions of competition, and 
ability of the performers influence this though the simpler and 
better known events are preferred to those which are complicated 
and of lesser prominence. 
Meets of this sort find particular usage in the so-called tele- 
graph (telephone or mail) method of competition in which teams 
distantly situated each participates on its home field and forwards 
the results to the opponents for comparison and determination 
of event and team places. The Hexathlon conducted by the 
Y. M. C. A. and the triangular meet carried on by Amherst, Wes- 
lyan and Tufts fully illustrate the type. 
Y. M. C. A. SENIOR HEXATHLON CONTEST. 
The Date. The Senior Hexathlon contest will be held during 
the month of February. 
Conduct of Events. 
The events do not need to be held on one night only. A com- 
petitor who has been tested in any event within the prescribed 
dates shall under no circumstances be given another trial in that 
event. 
When the events are conducted on more than one date the 
number in the events at any one test shall not be less than ten in 
Class A Associations, eight in Class B, and six in Class C. 
The purpose of these rules is to prevent individual men being 
tested in single events at all sorts of odd times without particularly 
favorable conditions and without proper officials. 
If all the events are not conducted at one time, they shall be 
grouped as follows: 
Group 1.—60 yard potato race, running high jump, twelve-pound shot put. 
Group 2.—160 yard potato race, standing broad jump and fence vault. 
The returns, for which purpose blanks will be furnished, must 
reach Dr. John Brown, Jr., 347 Madison Ave., New York City, 
not later than March roth.

Conditions of Competition. 
An entrance fee of $2.00 must accompany the Association’s 
application appearing on page nineteen. This fee is designed to 
cover the cost of the necessary printing, postage, and awards. 
Eligibility. 
Participation is open only to Y. M. C. A.’s which are members 
of the Athletic Leagues of the Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tions of the United States or Canada. Athletes must be members 
in good standing of the Association represented, and must con- 
form to amateur requirements. 
Classification of Associations. 
Associations are classified into three groups, A, B, and C. 
Class A includes Associations having a Physical Department 
membership of over 1,000. 
Class B includes Associations having a Physical Department 
membership of 500 to 1,000. 
Class C includes Associations having a Physical Department 
membership of less than 500. 
Note. The physical Department membership of February Ist, 
to be used as the basis of classification. 
Trophies. 
For each of the three classes, a trophy, similar in design and 
value, will be presented to the Association scoring the largest num- 
ber of points in all six events. 
A special trophy is also offered to the foreign Association scor- 
ing.the highest average number of points. 
The Events. 
Sixty yard potato race, 160 yard potato race, running high 
jump, standing broad jump, twelve-pound shot put and fence vault. 
Number of Competitors. 
The purpose of the Hexathlon is to encourage large par- 
ticipation in indoor athletics by the average young man. There- 
fore, it is urged that efforts be made to interest members of all 
classes by conducting tests in the events as a part of the regular
-P-A-G-E-209
  GROUP METHOD 201 
gymnasium work. Many Associations add to the local enthusiasm 
by organizing groups and classes for competition within ‘the Asso- 
ciation. The number of competitors whose points shall count 
for each Association is determined by the membership and is as 
follows: 
Class A. Associations shall send report of the points made by 
the best ten men in each of the six events. 
Class B. Associations shall report the points made by the best 
eight men in each event. 
Class C. Associations shall report the points made by the best 
six men in each event. 
Note.—This does not mean the same ten, eight or six men for 
the entire contest, but the best men in each separate event. 
Officials. 
Great care must be exercised in the selection of officials and in 
the interpretation of rules. Accuracy must be insisted upon in 
timing, measurements and judging. (See Athletic League Hand- 
book for rules governing officials.) The conditions governing 
competition must prevail.

AMHERST-WESLEYAN-TUFTS MEET. 
In following out the plan for giving a large number of men an 
incentive for participation in track, a group track meet was ar- 
ranged for the second year between Amherst and Wesleyan last
-P-A-G-E-212
204 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
spring. So successful had been the meet of the previous year that 
Tufts College was very glad to participate. Two days were 
selected from the third week in May. Each college competed on 
its own field. Fourteen events, seven each day, were agreed upon. 
Ten men competed in each event with the exception of the hurdles 
and pole vault, where competitors were scarce. 
By having plenty of officials, watches, and tapes the seven events 
on each day were run off smoothly in one hour and a half. The 
separate times and distances of the competitors were added to- 
gether and the totals wired to other colleges. In spite of the 
differences in time and the irregularities of telegraphing, the com- 
parative standing was known in the evening. Two points were 
awarded for winning an event and one point for second place. 
The results were as follows: (Table XII.)

This meet, because of the fact that the competitors did not 
face their opponents on the field, lacked much of the competitive 
element. In many ways, however, this form of meet has distinct 
advantages over the regular intercollegiate contest. Since more 
men competed it is a better indication of general strength of the 
college groups. The scoring might be done both on the basis of 
totals and first, second, and third places. The number of men 
competing was: Wesleyan, 64; Amherst, 75; and Tufts, 103. 
The men were allowed to compete in several events, but in the 
future it would be desirable to limit the number of events. In 
this meet Tufts had six men competing in three events, Amherst 
had nine men, and Wesleyan had fourteen competing in three or 
more events.

  GROUP METHOD 205 
AMHERST-TUFTS FRESHMAN MEET. 
In November, 1922, the freshman classes of Amherst and Tufts 
colleges had an interesting track meet with eighty per cent, or one 
hundred and forty freshmen of each college, competing in the 
100 yard dash, broad jump, and shot putt. Besides these three 
events there were thirty four-man relay teams at each college and 
a special event of ten men in the mile run. The Tufts freshmen 
competed at Medford and the Amherst freshmen at Amherst. 
The men competed during their regular physical education hours 
and ten days were given over to these events, although one week 
would have been sufficient. At the close of the period the times 
of each man, totals, and the averages were telegraphed to the 
opponents, The results were as follows. (Table XIII.)

The meet was very successful in that it gave some excellent 
competition as a climax to the fall track meet for the new men. 
Several more than the one hundred and forty competed in some of 
the events, thus giving an incentive for the participation of all the 
men, so that the best score for the eighty per cent might be ob- 
tained. Such meets without expense or time lost should be carried 
on much more extensively by colleges of nearly equal size.

  CHAPTER XIV 
School Programs of Individual Athletics 
There is a distinct tendency at the present time to organize 
individual athletic events as a major phase of the school physical 
training program. It is thus used in many institutions, including 
grade schools, high schools, and colleges, where well organized 
systems are in operation. In the following pages several methods 
that are in use are outlined. Each of the systems discussed works 
out quite successfully in the particular field where it is used but the 
supervisor should consider well his own conditions, including local 
needs, equipment and teaching staff, before finally adopting a pro- 
gram for his own use. A careful survey of these conditions com- 
bined with a period of experimentation should produce some definite 
conclusions from which the program could be shaped. 
NEW YORK SYSTEM. 
Frederick J. Reilly, principal of public school number 33 in 
New York City, uses events of this sort very effectively in a system 
of physical training which he has worked out for that school. In 
fact individual athletic events constitute the nucleus of his whole 
program. 
Matters of Organization. 
Under this system the pupils are arranged in two divisions 
(junior and senior), and then classified according to their grade, 
age, height, and weight. Each one of these four factors it is 
argued, bears a distinct influence on the performances of the 
pupils and therefore is assigned an exponent according to the rela- 
tive importance which it exerts on one’s motor ability. 
The exponents used are as follows. (Table XIV.)

Using these as a basis 5 classes have been arbitrarily established. These are the same for 
both divisions and are as follows. 
Claesettya n-ssh 0. A B Cc D E 
  Sum of exponents up to 21 22-25 26-29 30-33 34 or over 
  To find a boy’s class, therefore, the sum of his exponents is 
determined and he is automatically placed in class A, B, C, D 
or E. For example, a boy in: 
Exponent 
Grade 7B 6 
Age 12 years 6 mo. 5 
Height iS, ft. 21, nk 7 
Weight ror Ib. 6 
Sum of exponents 24 (Class B) 
It was found that there was comparatively little difference be- 
tween the age, height, weight and grade of the boys and girls at 
this particular stage of development so both boys and girls are 
classified on the same chart according to the same scale. 
At the beginning of each term each pupil takes a membership 
ticket in the athletic association which bears the exponent table. 
It also bears a chart showing the events used, the minimum 
standard of performance in each for each class, the rate of 
increase for each event, and the maximum number of points that 
may be secured. Thus each boy and girl can readily determine 
his class for athletic competition, and quite as readily, determine 
his record of achievement. The mathematics involved are in each 
case comparatively simple. 
All-around Training Emphasized. 
In working out his scheme Mr. Reilly uses several means of 
arousing and maintaining interest. In the first place he uses these 
events as sort of an all around efficiency test. In most of the 
events he uses a minimum standard which must be passed in order
-P-A-G-E-216
  
208 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
to get any credit for that event. The minimum number of points 
is five so that any boy or girl who cannot pass the minimum 
standard in a given event will immediately attempt to better his 
performance in that event for as soon as he gets over the minimum 
he can add five points to his record. On the other hand he has 
established a maximum performance in each event beyond which

the contestant can get no points. These maximum standards are 
considerably better than an average, yet they are not so high but 
what a superior boy could by specialization decidedly beat the 
mark. In the combination dip, for instance, the maximum for 
Class E in the senior division is twenty. A boy could train himself 
to do more but in view of the fact that he gets no more points 
for doing thirty than he does for twenty he is not encouraged 
beyond this point. Thus the scheme provides incentives for the 
boy or girl to practice those events they are weak in and dis-  
-P-A-G-E-218
210 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
courages specialization. In other words it emphasizes all around 
performance rather than specialization. (Tables XV and XVI.) 
Constant Knowledge of Ability. 
By using percentages each boy and girl knows his own rating 
compared to other individuals and to the average and thus pro- 
vides an incentive for constant practice. 
Instruction During Gym Period. 
The regular physical training period is given over largely to 
the practice of these events. The classes start with a short calis- 
thenic drill and spend the balance of the period practicing, start- 
ing, running, finishing, jumping, putting the medicine ball and so 
on. For this work the gymnasium classes are divided into squads 
which are permanent. ‘These squads are put on a competitive 
basis and a banner is awarded to the squad that shows the best 
record. 
Buttons Awarded. 
Boys or girls who pass a standard of one hundred and sixty 
points or better in athletics are awarded a bronze button; those 
who attain a similar high standard in academic scholarship are 
awarded a silver button; and those who pass both receive a gold 
button. Naturally all strive for the gold button so that good 
scholars are stimulated to improve their athletic rating and good 
athletes are stimulated to improve their scholarship. Pupils who 
win a button may wear the school emblem, others may not. 
Monthly Inter-class Meets. 
Monthly inter-class meets are also held. In these meets all of 
each class take part and the poorest performances are struck out 
leaving eighty per cent to be reckoned with in the final computing. 
The average performance in each class is then determined and 
the classes are ranked according to these averages. 
Inter-school Meets. 
Inter-school meets are also conducted. These are arranged with 
neighboring schools as conditions warrant and once each year, city 
championships are held. All of these meets are conducted on the 
same basis as the monthly inter-class meet.
-P-A-G-E-219
SCHOOL PROGRAMS OF INDIVIDUAL ATHLETICS 211 
Pentathlon. 
And, lastly, twice a year a pentathlon is conducted in which 
those holding the best records are allowed to compete. ‘There 
is a separate pentathlon for the boys and one for the girls. The 
events in the boys’ pentathlon are 80 yard dash, running high 
jump, shot putt, hop, step and jump, and combination dip. 
The events in the girls’ pentathlon are potato race, basketball, 
far throw, basketball goal shooting, serving in tennis, and baseball 
pitching. In these events the maximum standards are removed 
and the pupil can make as many points as possible—the regular 
scale of increase is continued beyond the set maximum in cases 
where this is necessary. Gold, silver and bronze medals are 
awarded for the first three places to each of the boys and the girls. 
DETROIT) SYSTEM. 
The Detroit system of physical training in the grade schools 
centers around four types of activity; stunts, individual athletic 
events, combative contests, and games. In carrying on the program 
each school elects an athletic captain, each room elects an ath- 
letic lieutenant and finally each room is divided into squads of six 
or eight who elect squad leaders. These captains are assembled 
once a month, taught the activities to be practiced during the com- 
ing month, coached in their duties and generally stimulated in the 
performance of their duties. Each captain is thus made responsible 
for the direction and supervision of the work in his school. The 
captains teach and supervise the lieutenants, the lieutenants teach 
and supervise the squad leaders and the squad leaders teach and 
supervise the individual squad members. 
Five New Events Monthly. 
In the individual athletic events part of the program five new 
events are introduced and used each month as follows. (Table 
XVIL.) 
Monthly Records in One Event. 
Thus it will be observed that in ten months fifty different ath- 
letic events will be practiced or at least recommended for practice. 
Of the five events introduced for use each month the first is 
emphasized and practiced a great deal in all of the schools. Each 
boy’s performance in this one event is measured and recorded’

under the direction of the school captains, and sent into the direc-

average performance of each school, the average performance of 
each class (8A, 8B, etc.), the average performance of all of the 
classes (SA, 8B, etc.), the city average and the best individual 
performance. These figures are then printed in sheet form and 
sent to the schools where they are posted. In this form each boy 
can compare his performance with the average of his class, the 
performance of his class with other classes in his league (the 
schools are divided into nine leagues of six, seven or eight schools 
in each) or other leagues, other schools, either in his league or 
other leagues and so on. All sorts of comparisons can be made. 
This provides an excellent stimulus for practice. 
Siijook Pecethilon. 
The whole system of competing by means of records in this way 
is shaped up into what is called the School Decathlon. The school 
showing the highest average in all ten events is given a City Cham- 
pionship banner. 
The other events are introduced and practiced with the idea 
of at least familiarizing the boys with them with the thought that 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
    SCHOOL PROGRAMS OF INDIVIDUAL ATHLETICS 213 
they may become interested in them and practice them in their 
leisure time. 
Individual Decathlon. 
In addition to the regular year round mass competition an 
Individual Decathlon contest is held twice a year—one at the 
end of each semester. Fourteen events are used in this competition; 
ten of these events are those featured in the year around program, 
the other four are the running hop, step and jump, the 220 yard 
dash, the pole vault for height, and the 100 yard hurdles. Each 
boy is required to do the pull-ups, sit-ups and floor dips but is 
allowed to select any seven of the other eleven. The pole vault 
for height and the 100 yard hurdle race, owing to the fact that 
there is but limited opportunity for practice, are not chosen often 
by the contestants and may be dropped from the list. Only eighth 
grade boys are allowed to enter, and each contestant must present 
a certificate showing that he has no organic weakness. The con- 
tests are conducted by the regular physical training staff in one 
of the centrally located High School gymnasiums. 
The test is spread out over two successive Saturdays. The first 
day serves as a preliminary test for the purpose of eliminating 
those who are palpably unfit for the competition. On this day 
each boy. executes the pull-ups, the sit-ups and the floor dips. Any 
contestant who fails to do six pull-ups, sixteen sit-ups, or ten floor 
dips is immediately eliminated. Failure in any one eliminates. 
The contestant’s scores in these three events go into his final 
record. 
In addition to these regular events each contestant is measured 
with respect to his grip, height, weight and lung capacity. Should 
his grip fall below sixty pounds or his lung capacity below two 
and six-tenths his height in inches he would be eliminated. These 
are required and recorded but are not included in the actual scor- 
ing of the contest. 
Then the boy is asked to present a record of his scholarship, 
scholastic effort, conduct, attendance and punctuality. He is also 
asked to relate what he has done in the way of camping, scouting, 
wrestling, boxing, first and so on. No credit is given for these 
but they are used here for the purpose of stimulating interest in 
them. 
Finally each boy is required to perform in good style ten of the 
gymnastic stunts. Any one who fails to do ten is eliminated.

  Zick INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
This closes the preliminary part of the contest. Those who 
have passed all of the events are allowed to enter the finals. This 
takes place on the following Saturday. At this time each con- 
testant elects seven of the remaining eleven events. 
The fourteen events are worked out in a point scoring system 
using a thousand points as a basis. ‘The table uses twenty-five 
ranks and is worked out on the basis of giving large credit for 
increase within the range of average and good performance but 
little credit for increase within the range of superior performance. 
In the pull-ups for instance an increase from six to seven is worth 
one hundred points while an increase from fifteen to sixteen is 
worth only ten additional points. This serves to stimulate the 
individual to practice the activities which he does only fairly or 
poorly and not attempt to better himself in activities which he does 
well. It makes for all around training. (Table XVIII.) 
In the final summing-up boys who score more than 8,600 points 
are awarded a gold medal, boys who score more than 7,300 are 
awarded a silver medal and boys who score more than 6,500 
points are awarded a bronze medal. 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM 
(SOUTHERN BRANCH). 
The program of physical training worked out at the Southern 
Branch of the University of California includes individual ath- 
letic events of this type and according to the report of F. W. 
Cozens, director in charge, they are used very successfully. In 
this institution the physical training classes meet twice a week. 
The classes average about forty men in number. In the first 
semester the men in each class are divided into four permanent 
teams and play through a baseball schedule of fourteen or fifteen 
games. 
Physical Efficiency Test. 
During the second semester each class is divided into four per- 
manent teams and carried through a program of individual ath- 
letic events and relay races. Before this is started, however, each 
man is put through the regular physical efficiency test which con- 
sists of six events: 100 yard dash, running broad jump, fence 
vault, rope climb, standing broad dive, medicine ball run. Each

Any one who fails to make the minimum (i.e., fails to vault 
nipple high, fails to climb the rope, etc.) in any event is placed in 
grade 4 for that particular event. Thus a contestant may score 
from six to twenty-four points according to his ability. In this 
system the lower the score the greater the ability. 
Teams Organized. 
The total grades of each man in each class are determined. The 
men in each class are then arbitrarily grouped into four teams. 
The four men with the best grades are placed on four different 
teams; the four next best are similarly distributed and so on until - 
all have been assigned. The object is to make teams of about 
equal strength. 
Preliminary Meet. 
This is followed by a percentile scoring competition in four 
events. This is done for the purpose of getting the men in better 
condition for the meets which are to follow and also make changes 
in the teams if the records seem to warrant it. Teams which 
show up especially strong in this competition exchange one or two 
of their better performers for a similar number of poorer per- 
formers from a weak team. This adjustment is made to balance 
the competition.

This is completed in two weeks. Each team spends a ‘day on 
each event, thus finishing in four days. The average number of 
points made by each team in each event is determined. This 
appears as follows. (Table XXI.)

It will be noticed that teams A and B are much stronger than 
teams C and D. This requires some adjustment and in conse- 
quence one or two strong contestants from teams A and B would 
be exchanged for a similar number of weaker players from teams 
C and D. 
Daily Meets. 
This is followed by daily track and field meets consisting of 
three events plus a relay. New events are used each day. Each 
man is required to enter two events and may enter three and the 
selection of the relay teams is left to the captains of the team. 
These meets are carried on in general like a regular meet except 
that everything is sped up. The first three places score 5, 3 and 1 
points respectively.

Records Posted. 
Records of each days’ competition are posted. The “to date” 
standing of each team is also posted. And a comparative record 
of the best performance of the different classes is posted. These 
serve to stimulate and maintain the interest of the students. 
Many Winners. 
The one thing of special interest that should be noted in this 
program is that many events other than the standard events were 
used and that a large number of men became record holders going 
to show that nearly every one, if he has any athletic ability at all, 
can excel in some type of athletic activity if that activity is pro- 
vided. A few individuals do well in all events, a few excel in 
running, a few in jumping, a few in throwing, a few in strength 
events and soon. The records show that the winners in the thirty- 
seven individual events used were distributed as follows: 
One contestant won 8 events 
One contestant won 6 events 
One contestant won 4 events 
One contestant won 3 events 
Five contestants won 2 events 
Two contestants won 1 event. 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  SCHOOL PROGRAMS OF INDIVIDUAL ATHLETICS 219 
In other words, eleven different students established themselves 
as record holders. By using a greater variety of events the num- 
ber of winners would be still greater. This is desirable from the 
standpoint of distributing glory and stimulating interest. 
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS SYSTEM. 
In the fall of 1924 the University of Illinois instituted a regu- 
lation which requires all students to take physical education dur- 
ing their entire residence at school. By this requirement each 
student must take some kind of physical activity for four years, 
twice weekly. To meet this requirement the department of physi- 
cal education for men has organized a program which includes 
several types of activities for each year from which each student 
can elect one for each semester. The program as organized at 
present is as follows: 
Freshmen courses 
Individual gymnastics (for subnormals) 
Swimming (for non-swimmers) 
Individual Athletics (plus “Illini Eleven”) 
Tumbling Stunts (plus “Illini Eleven”) 
Sophomore courses 
Individual gymnastics (for subnormals) 
Advanced Swimming 
Boxing 
Wrestling 
Fencing 
Apparatus Stunts 
Junior courses 
Individual gymnastics (for subnormals) 
Life Saving 
Basketball 
Baseball (plus playground ball) 
Soccer 
Circus Stunts 
Senior courses 
Individual gymnastics (for subnormals) 
Volley ball 
Hand ball 
Tennis 
Golf 
Regular Course. 
Individual athletics is thus seen to be a full course, elective in 
the freshman year. There were four sections enrolled in this 
course. Betokening the interest in this type of work individual 
athletics had the largest enrollment of any of the freshman 
courses. All classes in the University are arranged on the hour  
-P-A-G-E-228
  220 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
basis; deducting ten minutes for shifting between classes, the 
purely academic classes are fifty minutes in length. To allow the 
men time to change from street clothes to gymnasium costume 
and then back to street clothes the physical education classes have 
to be reduced to thirty-minute periods. 
“fllini Eleven.” 
The first ten minutes of the course in individual athletics is de- 
voted to the performance of a setting-up drill known as the “‘Illini 
Eleven.” In shaping-up the course it was decided to teach all 
students a good calisthenic drill which they could use during after- 
college days. This drill was formed and called the “Illini Eleven.” 
In view of local conditions which were temporarily unavoidable 
the sections in individual athletics were abnormally large (ranging 
from one hundred to two hundred and fifty in a class) it was 
decided to introduce the ‘Illini Eleven” with these classes. The 
drill could be given while the roll was being taken. To meet this 
situation numbered spots were placed on the floor. Thus when 
the signal to fall-in is given each student takes a position on his 
number, one instructor leads the class in the “Illini Eleven’? while 
another takes the roll. 
Organized by Squads. 
The floor numbers are arranged in rows with ten in a row. 
For the individual athletic work each row of ten was considered 
a squad, an arrangement that proved to be very satisfactory for 
organized work. At the beginning of the semester, to secure men 
who had natural leadership ability and experience in leading, men 
who had served as captains of athletic teams in High School were 
selected and placed at the head of each row. These men were 
appointed captains for the respective squads. With from one 
hundred to two hundred and fifty men in a class it is thus seen that 
there were from ten to twenty-five squads in each class. 
Events. 
In shaping up the program of activities it was decided to con- 
centrate on ten representative events and foster the practice of 
ten additional events. These events are listed in the following 
table. (Table XXII.)

Students Keep Own Records. 
In view of the large number taking part in this work it was 
deemed impossible for the department to keep the student records. 
The experiment of having the student keep his own records was 
thus made. For this purpose a percentile scoring chart covering 
the ten main events was printed in folder form and a copy pre- 
sented to each student. The students were then instructed to take 
the charts home and keep their own records as they executed the 
various events. To determine the amount of improvement the 
students were tested in the ten events at the beginning of the 
semester and again at the end of the semester. By plotting the 
records made in these two tests on the chart the amount of improve- 
ment was readily determined. The chart with a set of records duly 
installed is shown as follows. (Table XXIII.) 
Out-of-Doors Work Emphasized. 
As much of the work as possible was carried on out of doors. 
To meet the climatic need sweat shirts and sweat pants were made 
the required uniform. As an indication of the success of this out- 
of-doors idea there were but seven days in the entire first semester 
(October first to February first) on which the sections had to stay 
inside. The classes were kept indoors only during an actual rain 
storm or snow storm; wet grounds and cold days were not con- 
sidered sufficient reason for staying inside.

Equipment. 
The equipment available for the conduct of the work was as 
follows: 
Outdoors Indoors 
. Quarter mile running track I. 117 yard running track A 
Two 100 yd. straightaway tracks 2. Battery of four medicine ball throwing 
. Battery-of six shot putting pits courts 
. Battery of six broad jumping pits 3. Two hitch kicks 
. Battery of three high jumping pits 4. Six basketball baskets 
. Field inside of the running track 5. Five climbing ropes 
6.

auperx . Battery of five stall bars 
. Gymnasium floor 120 by 90 
Stop watches, shots, medicine balls, basketballs, and similar 
equipment necessary to the practice of the ten main events were 
available. In addition there was miscellaneous other equipment 
such as two horizontal bars, two horizontal ladders, a pirouette, 
etc., for the practice of the other events. 
Management. 
In conducting the work each class was divided into groups of 
from one to six squads and assigned to the various types of activity. 
For instance, squads 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 would be assigned to the rope 
climb, squads 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 to the running broad jump, 
squads 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 to the shot put, squads 18, 19 and 
20 to the half mile, squads 21 and 22 to the running high kick, and 
squads 23, 24 and 25 to the medicine ball throw. At the close of 
the “Illini Eleven” the assignments would be made and each cap- 
tain would secure the necessary equipment, lead his group to the 
proper station and immediately start the practice of his event. 
Only one event was practiced each day. At the close each captain 
returned all equipment to its proper station. 
Meets Conducted. 
For the purpose of creating additional interest two other 
features were promoted and carried out. The first consisted of a 
section meet open to all members of each section who were inter- 
ested. Each student was allowed to enter events of his own 
choice. About twenty per cent of each section took part in these 
individual section meets. They were entirely voluntary and held at 
a time apart from the regular class period. This was purely an 
individual affair and conducted according to the regular place 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
224 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
method—first, second, third and fourth places were awarded 
in each event. Inasmuch as there were four sections there were 
four of these meets. 
The second feature consisted of an inter-section meet open only 
to the winners of the first four places in the original sectional 
meets. This meet was again purely voluntary and held at a non- 
class period. In this meet individual places were awarded four, 
three, two and one for the first four places respectively, and the 
sectional championship was determined accordingly. The score 
for the final meet was kept on a large blackboard something as 
follows, (Table XXIV,)

The program worked out very well under the circumstances. 
The chief objection lay in the size of the classes. In another year 
when an additional gymnasium will be available and classes can 
be reduced to sixty the plan should work out splendidly. 
FRESHMEN INDOOR INDIVIDUAL ATHLETIC 
EVENTS. 
Another project involving individual athletic events has been 
carried on which has also proven to be exceedingly satisfactory. 
Coaching school classes, classes in individual athletics, classes in 
tumbling stunts and classes in apparatus stunts are scheduled for 
the gymnasium from eight o’clock in the morning until six o’clock 
in the evening. In view of the fact that class periods lasted only 
thirty minutes the floor was free from regular class work for thirty 
minutes between classes. Students were constantly coming into the 
gymnasium before class and remaining after class, but for the most 
part they “just hung around.” There was decided evidence of the 
fact that they wanted to do something but didn’t know what to do. 
To meet the needs of this group and get maximum building  
-P-A-G-E-233
  SCHOOL PROGRAMS OF INDIVIDUAL ATHLETICS 225 
efficiency, volley ball, medicine balls, and what was called ‘Fresh- 
men Tumbling Stunts” and “Freshmen Indoor Athletic Events” 
were introduced. 
Tumbling Stunts. 
The last two projects were purely experimental, so the instructors 
blundered along as experience and situations indicated. The first 
project consisted of the posting of about twenty single and twenty 
double tumbling stunts with drawings illustrating the execution of 
the same. These were printed on large cards and posted on the 
wall near the point where several mats were habitually spread on 
the floor. Events were taken from the chart and added to it as 
observation of their practice warranted. 
Preliminary Arrangements. 
The second project first involved the installation of some appar- 
atus and the painting of figures on the floor. Two hitch kicks were 
secured. A diagram for the pirouette, a court for medicine ball 
throwing and a court for leaping were painted on the floor. Two 
permanent horizontal bars, two horizontal ladders, a set of travel- 
ing rings, and a set of stall bars were also available. 
With this equipment installed twenty events were selected which, 
in the judgment of the instructors, should prove interesting to the 
students. A limited number of records in each event were taken and 
with these at hand sheets were formulated for posting. For the pur- 
pose of stimulating the average and poor performer it was decided 
to present an average performance in each, and for the purpose 
of stimulating the good performers it was decided to post the 
record in each with the record holder’s name. A statement to the 
effect that everyone should be able to make an average perform- 
ance was thus included. A second statement to the effect that if 
any one felt he could better the existing record he should so advise 
one of the instructors and secure a trial demonstration was also 
included. ‘Thus, whenever an existing record was better the new 
record and the new record holder’s name would be introduced on 
the sheet. 
These sheets were then posted; each near the apparatus or 
point of execution of each event. The kicking events near the hitch 
kick apparatus, the leaping events near the leaping court, the 
medicine ball events near the medicine ball throwing court, the 
bar snap, bar push, and bar vault near the horizontal bar, the pull-

  226 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
Freshmen Indoor Athletic Events 
Each Freshmen should equal or surpass the average performance 
given below. 
The present record, given below, represent the best performance 
scored in the present freshmen class. Any freshman who feels that he 
can break this record should ask one of the instructors for a trial 
demonstration. 
What can you do? A little practice before and after class will 
improve your record tremendously. 
Standing Broad Hop 
Stand on one foot toeing the take-off line. Hop forward landing on 
the same foot. The raised foot must be kept off the floor until after the 
leap is definitely completed. Falling backward or hopping backward 
after the leap constitutes a foul and is invalid. The point nearest the 
take-off touched by the hopping foot is taken as the mark. The distance 
from the mark to the take-off line is the record of performance. 
Average Performance: 6 ft.

ups near the horizontal ladder, the floor dips and sit-ups near the 
stall bars, the ring travel near the traveling rings and the pirouette 
near the pirouette. The outline given below of the standing broad 
hop is a sample of the form used. 
Plan Very Successful. 
What was the result? From the start, men could be seen about 
the gymnasium, between classes, practicing the various events. 
Not only were they practiced by the former idlers, but large num- 
bers of other men came before class and remained after to work at 
them. Two or three men would be trying the pirouette, several 
others trying the kicking events, several others jumping, one or two 
would be trying the bar events, etc., the different events would be 
practiced. Competitions between friends developed, new records 
were attempted, and in various ways the idea succeeded. And best 
of all, the events have continued to hold interest. It can’t be said 
that there is a general stampede to try them, but on the other hand 
the general interest is so marked that twice the number of men 
use the floor between classes as formerly and idling has completely 
disappeared. 
Revised List of Events. 
Two years’ experience has shown that certain events are popular 
while others are not popular. In view of this fact it is the plan 
to cut out the more unpopular events and concentrate on those 
which are popular. The events which will be used in the future and 
the general order of their popularity are shown on the following 
table:
-P-A-G-E-235

The last three events are not particularly popular, but they afford 
training and development of such important muscle groups that it 
is felt they should be retained and fostered as much as possible. 
Several bar bells have been secured and weight lifting is the newest 
addition to the list of events. 
Advantages of Plan. 
The scheme offers many advantages. The greatest advantage, 
perhaps, lies in the fact that it is almost automatic in operation; the 
instructors merely encourage the practice of the events and the 
students do them of their own free will without supervision. It 
provides activity for scores of students who would otherwise do 
nothing but idle. It provides many students with an interest in 
physical activity that otherwise does not exist; a‘small number prac- 
tice one or two events which attract their interests, as religiously as 
those who are candidates for the regular varsity teams.

CHAPTER XV 
Miscellaneous Athletic Meets 
As previously mentioned the average individual thinks of an 
athletic meet in terms of the dozen or more events which comprise 
our regular track and field schedule. In a narrow sense this may 
be correct, but in the broader meaning of the term any measurable 
physical activity may be used in a meet of this sort. In the preced- 
ing chapters a large number of special activities and special meets 
have been described. In the following pages for the purpose of 
further illustrating the possibilities that exist in this field, a num- 
ber of other meets a little different from the common run have 
been outlined. It should be explained that the meets included by 
no means exhaust the field. In reality the field is unbounded; the 
only limitations which exist are the imagination and the inventive 
genius of the instructor. Some of the events used in this chapter 
are described here; those which are not will be found in the chapter 
on “Individual Athletic Events.” 
Baseball Meet. 
There are several elements of the game of baseball which may 
be readily used in the organization of a baseball meet which proves 
to be very interesting. The events which may be used are: (1) 
pitcher’s throw, (2) catcher’s throw, (3) target throw, (4) far 
throw, (5) fungo hit, (6) bunt and run, and (7) running the bases. 
For the purpose of illustrating how a meet of this sort may be 
conducted I shall outline one that was carried on on one of the 
playgrounds of Northampton, Massachusetts, in the summer of 
1915. The meet was held in the afternoon and participated in by 
about twenty-five boys who happened to be present. Five events 
were used: (1) the catcher’s throw, (2) the far throw, (3) the 
fungo hit, (4) the bunt and run and (5) running the bases. 
The catcher’s throw was conducted first. A barrel was placed 
on second base with the open end toward home base. The con- 
testants stood on the home base and threw at the barrel. Each 
contestant was given five throws which he made in immediate suc- 
228
-P-A-G-E-237
    
MISCELLANEOUS ATHLETIC MEETS 229 
cession. Balls landing on the barrel on the fly scored three points, 
on the first bounce two points, and after the second bounce and on 
the roll one point. Balls failing to enter the barrel but hitting it 
scored one point. Balls failing to enter or touch the barrel scored 
nothing. 
In the far throw, after establishing a throwing line about ten 
feet long, four lines were scratched on the ground 150 feet, 175 
feet, 200 feet, and 225 feet from it and parallel to it; these were 
each about forty feet long and were used to facilitate measuring. 
A ten foot stick that happened to be available was used to measure 
the intermediate distances. Each contestant was given three throws 
which were made in immediate succession. Each was marked by a 
short stake which was stuck in the ground, but only the farthest 
was measured. 
The lines used for the baseball throw also served for the fungo 
hit. Each contestant was given three hits. Each made his three 
hits in immediate succession. Each hit was marked by a stake but 
only the farthest was measured and recorded. 
In the bunt and run each contestant was given two trials which 
were made separately in turn as the contestants’ names appeared 
on the sheet. 
In the running the bases event the contestants were given but one 
trial. Each ran separately against time. 
A score card was kept something as follows. (Table XXV.)

Ete. 
The meet, which was carried on rather leisurely, was finished in a 
little less than two hours. No prizes were given: the whole affair
-P-A-G-E-238
  
230 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
was carried on quite informally. Competition was purely indi- 
vidual and by events. There were no teams. The meet was ex- 
tremely successful, so successful that the boys who took part as well 
as many who were not present repeatedly requested another. Other 
matters however prevented. 
The above meet is of course merely indicative of what can be 
done. The pitcher’s throw, the target throw and other events 
which may be devised by the imaginative instructor may be used in 
the organization of meets which will be found very interesting. 
Any playground that had a league of four or five teams could 
carry on a meet of this sort by teams, using the regular baseball 
teams as units. 
Playground Ball Meet. 
The event used in connection with a baseball meet may be also 
very satisfactorily used in shaping up a playground ball meet. In 
a playground ball meet either the 12 or 14 inch ball may be used 
and the bases should be fifty feet apart. The pitcher’s throw 
should be 35 feet in length. 
Golf Meet. 
The possibilities of golf seem to have been overlooked by those 
who are interested in playground programs. There are scores of 
playgrounds located in parts which could well maintain a miniature 
golf course of from three to six holes from 50 to 150 yards apart. 
Tees, greens, bunkers and such are not necessary. All that is 
required is two stakes to line off the tees for each hole, a few tomato 
cans to make the holes and a few golf sticks and balls which may be 
secured from a neighboring golf club. Discarded clubs and old 
balls will serve very well. And clock golf would be found practical 
and very useful on a large number of playgrounds. A clock golf 
course may be set up on any fairly level piece of ground. Twelve 
empty tomato cans set equi-distance apart in a circle about forty 
feet in diameter is very satisfactory. A grass surface is better if 
available but the bare ground will serve the purpose quite as well 
for ordinary purposes. 
In addition to being an attractive game golf offers excellent pos- 
sibilities for individual athletic competition. (1) Driving for 
distance, (2) approaching for accuracy, (3) approaching for 
accuracy over a hazard, (4) putting for accuracy, and (5) clock 
golf and other events of a similar nature may be used.
-P-A-G-E-239
    
MISCELLANEOUS ATHLETIC MEETS 231 
How a meet of this nature may be conducted will be illustrated 
by one that was carried on with a group of convalescent soldiers at 
Colonial Beach on the Potomac in the summer of 1919. 
The meet was carried on in a cow pasture. A clock golf course 
made with tin cans of several dimensions, a few warped golf sticks 
and about two dozen much abused balls constituted our entire 
equipment. Twenty men took part and five events were used—the 
five previously mentioned. 
The drive for distance was used first. A line ten feet long 
served as the driving line. The balls were teed on this line. Two 
parallel rows of stakes placed at 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, and 210 
yards were used as markers. Each contestant made three drives 
in succession. Each ball was left where it stopped until all three 
balls had been driven and then the farthest was measured and 
recorded. ‘The intervals between the markers were paced off in 
making the measurements. 
A line ten feet long about 150 feet from a “‘tin-can’”’ hole served 
as the tee line in the approach for accuracy. Each contestant drove 
five balls. All five were left where they stopped and then meas- 
ured. A piece of string about forty feet long tied to a stake at the 
hole with markers at 10 feet, 20 feet and 30 feet worked excel- 
lently. The string was drawn taut and those balls which rested 
within 10 feet of the hole scored 3 points; those that lay between 
10 feet and 20 feet from the hole scored 2 points; those which 
rested between 20 feet and 30 feet scored one point. Those which 
lay more than 30 feet from the hole scored nothing. 
The approach for accuracy over a hazard was carried on as the 
preceding event with the exception that a convenient fence about 
fifty feet from the hole was used as a hazard; the driving line was 
placed about.ten feet beyond the fence and, owing to the fact that 
all of the contestants were novices, we allowed each to drive until 
five balls had gone over the fence. 
In the clock golf event each traversed the course of 12 holes at- 
tempting to make the lowest score possible. As I remember, 35 
was the best score. The men had played the game from early 
morning until dark and had become quite skilled at it. 
In the putt for accuracy we scratched a circle on the ground six 
feet from the hole. Each contestant made five putts from any 
place on the circle. Successful putts scored one point, failures 
scored nothing. 
The meet was carried on rather leisurely and took about two 
hours to complete. A score card was kept and posted after the
-P-A-G-E-240
    
232 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
meet. While the whole thing was quite informal it furnished 
wholesome conversation for days afterward. Needless to say 
records made at the meet were repeatedly broken in the days that 
followed. 
Horizontal Bar Meet. 
The horizontal bar offers interesting possibilities in the way of 
athletic competition. (1) The bar vault, (2) the one-hand bar 
vault, (3) the fence vault, (4) the bar push, (5) the bar snap for 
distance, (6) the bar snap for height, (7) the pull-ups, (8) the 
curl-ups, (9) the hanging hinge, (10) the hanging half lever, (11) 
the knee raise and (12) the bar climb may all be carried on here. 
For the sake of experiment a meet of this sort was carried on 
with one of the coaching school classes at the University of Illinois. 
There were twenty-seven in the class but one was unable to take 
part owing to injuries. In view of the fact that about half of the 
class was from outside of the state of Illinois it was decided to 
have “Illinois” compete against those from ‘Out of the State.” 
(There were 15 of the first group and 11 of the other.) The 
injured member was appointed judge and recorder of one team 
while the instructor acted as judge and recorder for the other. Six 
events were used (1) bar vault, (2) fence vault, (3) bar snap 
for distance, (4) bar push for distance, (5) curl-ups and (6) pull- 
ups. In view of the fact that we had two bars one team was 
assigned to each. It was decided to hold a purely mass affair; the 
average score of one group against the average score of the other. 
To this end each individual’s record in the first four events was 
taken in inches. ‘The records of each team were totaled and then 
divided by the number of players on the team. Thus each team 
was awarded first or second place. In the last two events the indi- 
vidual records of the members of each team were added, then 
divided in the same way, thus computing the average performance. 
The score tabulated at the finish appeared something as follows. 
(Table XXVI.) 
Three things combined to make the meet more than usually 
interesting; one was the form of competition, “Illinois” verses “The 
Rest of the Universe,” as one student put it; another was the fact 
it was a group competition rather than individual competition; and 
lastly, the fact that the two teams worked at the same time side 
by side.

Soccer Football Meet. 
A soccer football meet is quite practical and an interesting devia- 
tion from the regular playing of the game. Last fall the class in 
soccer football at the University of Illinois was carried through a 
meet of this sort. One event was used at the close of each period 
for six days. The events used were (1) punt for distance, (2) 
bounce kick for distance, (3) place kick for distance, (4) goal 
kick for accuracy, (5) dribble kick for accuracy, and (6) corner 
kick for accuracy, (7) heading for accuracy, (8) heading for dis- 
tance, (9) soccer dribble (indoors) and (10) soccer dribble (out- 
doors) are also good events for a competition of this sort, but were 
not used in the above. 
In the three distance kicks the ball was kicked from behind or on 
the goal line. The kicks were marked where the ball first hit the 
ground. Each contestant was given three trials in each event; 
these were made in immediate succession. Each was marked by 
sticking a stake in the ground and then the best one of the three was 
measured. ‘The cross lines were used in measuring; the intervals 
between the cross lines were measured by pacing. Thus each kick 
was judged and measured from the goal line and not necessarily 
from the point of kicking. 
The goal kick for accuracy and the dribble kick for accuracy 
were made from on the 30 yard line and from behind the 30 yard 
line respectively. Each contestant was given four kicks. (We 
had four balls.) Balls going through the goal on the fly scored 
three points, those that went through on the first bounce scored two 
points, those that went through after the second bounce or on the 
roll scored one point, and those that failed to go through scored 
nothing. The total number of points made by each contestant in 
each event represented his score for that event. 
To carry on the corner kick for accuracy two lines were scratched 
on the ground from the goal posts directly into the field to the 5 
yard cross line; the area inclosed was the target. Each contestant  
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
was given four kicks. Each was allowed to choose the corner from 
which he was to kick. In making the kick the ball was placed in 
the corner of the field. The contestant attempted to kick the ball 
so it landed in the target. The kick was judged according to where 
it first hit the ground. Those that landed in the target scored one 
point; those that failed to land in the target scored nothing. 
There were eighteen in the class. By hurrying, each event was 
completed in less than ten minutes. One of the members of the 
class kept a score card as follows. (Table XXVII.)

Basketball Meet. 
Basketball likewise offers splendid opportunity for competition 
of a measurable sort. While serving as physical director in the 
Holyoke Y. M. C. A. I conducted a meet of this variety with the 
High School gymnasium class. Five events were used: (1) Free 
throw, (2) goal shooting for speed, (3) outside circle throw, (4) 
one hand shot, and (5) throw for distance. In a meet of this 
sort (6) the basketball dribble, (7) the double trial shot, and (8) 
the basketball throw for accuracy may be used also. 
In the free throw event each contestant was given ten trials. 
The number of successful throws made by each represented his 
score. 
In the goal shooting for speed each contestant was given thirty 
seconds to make as many baskets as he could. Each shot was made 
from any point the contestant desired. The number of successful 
throws made by each represented his score. 
In the goal shooting for accuracy each contestant was given five 
throws, each being made from behind the circle inclosing the free
-P-A-G-E-243
  MISCELLANEOUS ATHLETIC MEETS 235 
throw line. The total number of baskets made by each represented 
his score. 
In the one hand shooting event each contestant was given five 
throws. In making each throw the contestant stood on the rim of 
the circle inclosing the free throw line, bounced the ball on the free 
throw line, ran and caught it with both hands, and then, after taking 
one step, attempted to push the ball into the basket with one hand. 
The number of successful shots made by each represented his score. 
Owing to the fact that our floor space was limited we were com- 
pelled to use the standing throw in the throw for distance. Each 
contestant was given three throws; these were. made in succession. 
All three were marked but only the best one was measured. The 
throws were made from behind one of the end lines of the Basket- 
ball court. The free throw line, the end line and a volley ball line 
on the opposite end of the court were used in measuring the throws. 
The distance of each of these from the throwing line was de- 
termined and chalked on the floor. In measuring a throw the 
judge paced from one of these lines to the mark and then by adding 
or subtracting determined the distance of each throw. 
In conducting the meet the free throw and goal shooting for 
speed were conducted at the same time at opposite baskets; the goal 
shooting for accuracy and the one hand goal shoot were conducted 
in the same way; and the far throw was conducted by itself at the 
finish. The contestants moved about as they wished so long as they 
did not interfere with the events going on. They did not compete 
in any prescribed order; each executed the event at one end and 
then moved to the other end and executed the event taking place 
there. Two leaders in the class acted as judges and scorers. About 
fifteen contestants took part. The meet took about an hour and 
fifteen minutes. The meet was purely an individual affair; each did 
his very best in each event because each was anxious to beat the 
others and each was curious to know how well he could perform. 
The meet had the effect of inducing a lot of informal competition 
that broke all of the records established. 
Medicine Ball Meet. 
If there are two or three medicine balls available a meet can be 
readily devised that will prove to be very interesting. The fol- 
lowing events could be used in a meet of this sort: (1) Free throw, 
(2) one hand throw, (3) overhead throw, (4) backward throw, 
+
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
(5) between legs throw, (6) putt, (7) forward throw, (8) flip, 
and (9) target roll. 
For the sake of creating a little diversion a-meet of this sort was 
carried on in connection with one of the coaching school classes at 
the University of Illinois. Five events were used; one hand throw, 
backward throw, forward throw, overhead throw and putt for 
distance. 
The group of thirty-five members were assembled behind the side 
line of the basketball court. The side line was the throwing line. 
Four chalk lines drawn equi-distance apart across the court divided 
the court into five areas fifty-four feet long and eighteen feet wide. 
One event was assigned for conduct in each area; these were 
chalked on the floor in each area just inside of the throwing line. 
Five spectators supplied with chalk served as judges—one for 
each area. Each was directed to stand in the area he was assigned 
to in the general neighborhood of where the balls could be expected 
to land. 
The five events were demonstrated and explained. Each con- 
testant was then given three throws (made in immediate succes- 
sion) in each event. Each of the three trials was marked by a 
small chalk mark and at the close of each contestant’s effort the best 
throw was marked with his initials and the other two erased with 
the foot. Foul throws and throws which landed outside of the 
proper area were counted as trials but not marked. The judge 
was the arbiter of this. 
The contestants made their attempts at the various events in 
irregular order; they made them as they chose. As all of the con- 
testants were required to stay behind the throwing line and all of 
the events were carried on simultaneously and continuously, all 
finished at about the same time. The contestants were then 
awarded first, second, third and fourth and last places in each 
event. Then, for the sake of curiosity, the best records in each were 
measured. 
Five medicine balls were used—one for each area. From start 
to finish the meet lasted about twenty minutes. The following 
diagram outlines the general layout for the meet. (Dia. 49.) 
Rugby Football Meet. 
I have never carried on what could be called a football meet, but 
there is every reason to believe that such a meet would be a great 
success. There are eight events that could be very readily used: (1)
-P-A-G-E-245
  MISCELLANEOUS ATHLETIC MEETS 237 
  ORK XO OXON REX RNeK XOX XNORO KN OON 
DIAGRAM 49 
punt for distance, (2) drop kick for distance, (3) place kick for 
distance, (4) forward pass for distance, (5) drop kick for goal, 
(6) place kick for goal, (7) forward pass for accuracy, and (8) 
football target throw. These events are described in the chapter 
on athletic events, so it will not be necessary to describe them here. 
Events of this nature could be used on the playground in the fall or 
spring with a miscellaneous group. Or they could be used in con- 
nection with a physical training class in the high school during these 
same seasons when the class should be taken out of doors. 
Strength Meet. 
There are quite a number of so-called strength events. To cite 
the most common we have: (1) pull-ups, (2) push-ups, (3) 
floor dips, (4) squat and dip, (5) stand, squat and dip, (6) leg 
lifts, (7) sit-ups, (8) trunk lifts, (9) hanging hinge, (10) support 
hinge, (11) knee raise, (12) hanging half lever, (13) support half 
lever, (14) curl-ups, (15) knee dips, (16) one leg squats, (17) one 
arm overhead lifts, (18) weight lifts, and (19) grip. These are 
all described in the chapter on athletic events. 
Owing to the fact that practically every one of these events re- 
quires so much energy and takes so much out of a performer, or as 
one has said, “reduces the supply of juice,” it is practically impos- 
sible to use a group of them in a continuous meet. It would be 
quite possible, though, to use one each time a class met over a 
period of four or five weeks. The records could be taken at the 
close of the gym class. The class could be divided into two or four 
permanent teams. In certain events, such as the hanging half lever, 
the total time of each team would represent each team’s score; in
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
other events, such as the pull-ups and sit-ups, the total number of 
performances would represent each team’s score. A score sheet 
showing the performance of each individual in the class, with first 
place in each event circled in red, and last place circled in green, and 
the average performance noted at the bottom of each would be 
quite stimulating. 
Hitch Kick Meet. 
Where a hitch kick is available a very interesting meet consist- 
ing of a variety of kicks plus a couple of miscellaneous events can be 
conducted. The events that can be used with this apparatus are as 
follows: (1) free kick, (2) standing stretch kick forward, (3) 
standing stretch kick backward, (4) standing double kick forward, 
(5) standing double kick backward, (6) standing high kick, (7) 
running high kick, (8) running hitch kick, (9) sky jump, (10) 
running high touch, and (11) jump and reach. 
While serving as Physical Director of the Y. M. C. A. at Lock- 
port, N. Y., I conducted the High School gymnasium class through 
an elimination in seven of these events. The standing stretch kick 
backward, the standing double kick backward, and the running 
high touch were not used. The class had been practicing the events 
for two or three weeks, so all who took part knew each event by 
name and showed some skill in performance. About twenty boys 
took part in the meet. 
All of the events were carried on on the same basis. Each con- 
testant was given two trials at each height—failure in two trials 
eliminated. At the beginning of each event the drum was set 
where all could kick or touch it. It was raised by four-inch inter- 
vals until two contestants had been eliminated; it was then raised 
by three-inch intervals until ten or half had been eliminated; it was 
then raised by two-inch intervals until all but four had been elim- 
inated; thereafter it was raised by one-inch intervals. It should be 
explained, though, that the drum was left at each height until all had 
tried that height. For instance, in the stretch kick forward let us” 
say the drum was placed at four feet. All kicked it. Then it 
was placed at four feet four inches. One failed. Then it was 
placed at four feet, eight inches. Four more failed, making a total 
of five, three more than the stipulated number of two. The drum 
was then placed at four feet, eleven inches—raised three inches. 
Eight more failed, making a total of thirteen—three more than the
-P-A-G-E-247
  
MISCELLANEOUS ATHLETIC MEETS 239 
stipulated number of ten. The drum was then placed at five feet 
one inch—raised two inches. All touched it. Then to five feet 
three inches. Two failed. Then to five feet five, seven, and nine 
in turn, during which three more contestants were eliminated, 
making a total of eighteen eliminated—only two were left. The 
drum was raised thereafter one inch at a time. 
The entire meet was completed in about an hour and thirty 
minutes. The records were kept and placed neatly on a large card- 
board by one of the leaders. Posted afterward they stimulated 
a great deal of informal competition. 
Jumping Meets. 
Jumping always makes interesting competition. For some rea- 
son everyone thinks he can do better than they have done, and 
further is positive they can beat the mark of someone just ahead. 
Events that can be used in a meet comprised entirely of this type 
may be classified as follows: 
Broad jumps 
1. Standing broad jump 
2. Double jump 
3. Triple jump 
4. Seven jumps 
5. Spider jump 
6. Kangaroo jump 
7. Running broad jump

The possibilities for athletic competition in jumping, it will be 
noted, are large. It is quite possible and feasible to work out a 
meet using four or five of any one of these types, or variety of 
events selected from all groups may be used. With large groups 
and limited equipment, however, breadth events are by all means 
the most practical. 
Broad Jumping Meet. 
A meet of this sort carried on with a company of soldiers during 
the recent mobilization worked out as follows: There were about 
150 men in the company. Competition was by squads. Five events 
were used: (1) standing broad jump, (2) double jump, (3) stand- 
ing broad hop, (4) standing leap and jump, and (5) standing hop, 
step and jump. A convenient sidewalk served as the take-off. The 
company was put in line just behind the sidewalk. After putting 
the company at ease the general nature of the meet was explained. 
Each squad worked under the direction of its corporal. 
To carry on the first event the first member of each squad toed 
the edge of the sidewalk and jumped forward. The corporals 
marked the jumps. The second member of each squad toed the 
mark made by the first jumper and jumped forward. The third, 
fourth, and others followed in order until all had jumped. Each set 
jumped only when told to do so by the director. When all had 
jumped a piece of string held in the hands of two men and stretched 
out quickly determined the winning squad. This was done merely 
by holding one end of the string at the edge of the sidewalk and 
putting the thumb on it at the point of the first squad’s final mark. 
By walking from mark to mark and moving the thumb out along 
the string the winners were determined. 
The other events were decided in the same way. No records 
were kept. The winning squad’and the second squad in each event

was announced and that was the sum of the competition. The fol-

Jumping Jacks Meet. 
A “Jumping Jacks Athletic Meet” conducted on the Dalton, 
Mass., playground proved to be very successful. The meet was 
organized on the individual basis—each boy against all of the 
others. Six events were used: (1) standing broad jump, (2) 
standing backward jump, (3) standing sideward jump, (4) double 
jump, (5) standing hop, step and jump, and (6) standing broad 
hop. 
The entire meet was carried on at one jumping pit—one event 
atatime. ‘The instructor acted as director and judge; two larger 
boys acted as measurer and scorer. The measurer used a ten- 
foot stick graduated in inches, thus greatly facilitating his work. 
Each boy was given but one trial at each event, though all practiced 
about the pit at will before making their attempts. Each in- 
dividual’s performance was recorded by the scorer and at the end 
the records of each were totaled, thus the final score showed the 
total amount of ground covered by each boy. Places were awarded 
according to the final scores. The score card appeared something 
as follows. (Table XXVIII.) 
Vaulting Meet. 
There are nine events which might be used in a meet of this sort. 
(1) Post vault, (2) thief vault, (3) straddle vault for distance,

(4) squat vault for distance, (5) floor vault, (6) ring vault, 
(7) rope vault, (8) pole vault for height, (9) pole vault for 
distance. To be carried on successfully the last four events require 
considerable practice and skill. The first five events, however, may 
be used in an informal meet with no preliminary training, although 
it must be admitted, like everything else in athletics, the more 
training the contestants have the more successful will be the com- 
petition. 
A meet of this sort was conducted with one of the classes at 
the University of Illinois. Five events were used: (1) post vault, 
(2) thief vault, (3) straddle vault for distance, (4) squat vault 
for distance and (5) floor vault. There were about forty in the 
class. Having two vaulting bucks the class was divided in two 
sections of equal numbers. The bucks were set-up parallel to each 
other about twenty feet apart in the center of the floor. One sec- 
tion was placed in column in front of each buck. 
The post vault was carried on by the elimination method. Both 
groups, working independently under the direction of separate 
judges, were conducted through this event at the same time until 
there were but four or five left in the competition in each when it 
was halted. The names of these contestants were taken. 
The other events were carried on successively. Each contestant 
was given two trials at each event. As each contestant vaulted his 
mark was scratched on the mat and his initials put down beside it. 
When a contestant’s second attempt bettered his first, his first mark 
was erased by wiping a shoe over it. The names of the four best 
vaulters in each section in each event were taken. 
Thus we had from eight to ten contestants left for a final compe- 
tition. Both sections were then assembled on opposite sides of 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
MISCELLANEOUS ATHLETIC MEETS 243 
one buck. The leaders in the post vault were then put through the 
final elimination in this event. The players of the two sections 
were called alternately. The winners in the other four events 
were thereafter conducted through the finals; each contestant was 
given two trials. 
The first three places in each event scored three, two and one 
respectively. The team score, chalked on the floor, looked some- 
thing as follows. (Table XXIX.)

The meet required about forty-five minutes to complete and 
from every point of view was very satisfactory. 
Rope Skipping. 
Rope skipping offers interesting possibilities for competition that 
also seem to be neglected. The various rope skipping events that 
may be used are: (1) free style, (2) skipping, (3) running, (4) 
single jump, (5) double jump, (6) backward, (7) one leg. All 
of these types of clearing the rope may be carried on on the basis of 
(a) how many jumps can be done in a specified period of time— 
thirty seconds, one minute, etc., or (b) how fast can fifty or a 
hundred jumps be done. For mass competitions the first method 
is the best. Two, four, eight, ten or more contestants can com- 
pete at the same time; the only restriction is the number of ropes 
available. In view of the fact that the contestants skip the rope 
with varying speeds the second method requires a stop watch for 
each contestant. 
A class of thirty-eight students at the University of Illinois con- 
ducted through a meet of this sort worked out as follows: Two 
students were selected as officialsk—one as timer, the other as
-P-A-G-E-252
    244 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
scorer. Having six ropes the class was divided into six groups of 
sixeach. The groups were called A, B, C, D, E and F respectively. 
All seven of the events mentioned above were used. Each event 
was carried on on the basis of how many could be done in thirty 
seconds. 
The free style event was carried on first. Each member of sec- 
tion “A” took a rope. One member of section F was assigned to 
each of the members of section A to count the skips and act as 
judge. The timer, holding a stop watch, said ‘“Ready’—‘Set”— 
“Go,” and snapped the watch. All of the contestants of section A 
started jumping. On the expiration of thirty seconds the timer 
called “Stop,” upon which the contestants discontinued jumping. 
The members of section F reported the scores to the scorer who 
put them down on the score board. The members of section B 
took the ropes; the members of section A served as counters and 
the event was restarted. This was continued until all had made 
their attempt. 
The other events were carried on in the same way. By keeping 
score on a large blackboard that was available individual event 
winners, individual all-round winners, section event winners and 
section all-round winners were readily determined. The score was 
kept as shown in Table XXX. 
Diving Meet. 
There are four events that might be used in a meet of this de- 
scription: (1) the standing broad dive, (2) the running broad 
dive, (3) the standing high dive, (4) the running high dive. I 
have used these events considerably in various ways but have 
never used them in a meet comprised of them alone. When using 
these events in competition it is a good idea to have the class prac- 
tice them for several days prior to the meet. It requires a little 
coaching to execute a dive properly and so it will produce no harm- 
ful results, so it will work out more satisfactorily if the contestants 
have been trained in this technique beforehand. 
In practice and in competition care should be taken to use plenty 
of mats. In the standing broad dive one two-inch mat serves very 
well; the take-off line should be on the mat. In the running broad 
dive two two-inch mats should be used; the take-off line should be 
on the mat. In the standing high dive and running high dive three 
or four two-inch mats should be used; the take-off should be from 
the floor:

Horizontal Ladder Meet (or inverted parallels). 
Our American program of physical training offers without ques- 
tion a.more complete range of physical activities than that of any 
other nation, but it is undeniably weak in hanging and climbing 
activities. The majority of gymnasiums have horizontal ladders 
but they are used only. occasionally for informal play when the 
wandering class member jumps up and chins himself a few times 
or walks from one end to the other, and they are used still less
-P-A-G-E-254
  
246 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
for regular class work. Yet hanging represents one of the best 
activities the individual can engage in. The trouble with this piece 
of apparatus is that as it is used it offers nothing of instinctive 
interest to the performer; there are practically no stunts that can 
be done on it and the “exercises” used are laborious and unin- 
teresting. Through devising individual athletic events and injecting 
the element of competition, however, this piece of apparatus can 
be readily popularized. 
The events that can be used on this piece of apparatus are: (1) 
rung travel, (2) double jump, (3) hand over hand, (4) sideward 
travel, (5) hanging swing jump, (6) standing jump and catch, (7) 
running jump and catch. All of these events are explained in the 
second chapter. Ali but the first two can be carried on on the 
inverted parallels. 
In view of the fact that the average gymnasium has but one 
horizontal ladder it would be impossible to conduct a class through 
a meet of solely hanging events in one day, but it would be possible 
to use one or two a day, and thus in the course of several days com- 
plete a horizontal ladder meet. Another possibility is that of using 
one or two events of this sort in a meet of a miscellaneous nature. 
By having the contestants practice for a few days before the meet 
the work would take on real significance and the contestants would 
engage in an excellent form of activity that ordinarily is a sort of 
a bugbear. 
Racing Meets. 
The races which may be used in athletic meets are of five distinct 
types. They are as follows: 
I On feet alone 19. Toe grasp 
1. 15 yard dash 20. Squat jumping 
2. 40, 50, 60, 75, 100, 220 yard dash 21. Measuring feet 
3. Quarter, half, and mile 22. Crooked man

Boys’ Meet. 
The following racing meet carried on with about sixty boys at 
the Springfield Boys’ Club illustrates how a meet of this type may be 
carried on. Ten events were used in the following order: (1) run- 
ning, (2) all-fours, (3) hopping, (4) crab walk, (5) double jump- 
ing, (6) toe grasp, (7) lame dog, (8) galloping, (9) heel grasp, 
and (10) bear gallop. Each race was run from the wall at one 
end of the gym to a volley ball line about ten feet from the wall at 
the other end—each race was thus about 5o feet in length. 
The group was divided into four teams of fifteen each. All were 
placed along the side of the gymnasium. The instructor acted as 
starter and an older boy as judge. To conduct the first race team 
A was placed at the starting line—each member had one foot 
against the wall. On the signal “On your marks”—‘Get set”— 
“Go,” all ran for the finish line. The judge stationed here selected 
the winner. All but the winner returned to the side lines. Teams 
B, C, and D ran in turn. The four winners ran in the finals, de- 
termining first, second, third and fourth places. 
The other events were conducted in the same manner. The meet 
required about forty minutes from start to finish. A score kept on 
the wall in chalk appeared as follows. (Table XXXI.)

Muscle Meet. 
On another occasion a so-called ‘‘muscle-meet”’ was held. It was 
given this title because every normal boy from 12 to 15 years of
-P-A-G-E-256
    248 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ATHLETICS 
age takes great pride in his muscle; the “muscle meet’? was ex- 
tremely popular. Owing to the fact that nearly half of the boys in 
the class were newsboys, it was decided to hold the meet between the 
newsboys and the non-newsboys. One group was placed on one 
side of the gymnasium and the other group was placed on the other 
side. Each group was placed on the other side. Each group was 
told to “‘pair-up,” the boys making up each pair to be of about the 
same height and weight. The general nature of the meet was then 
explained so the pairing would be done as satisfactorily as possible. 
The captains of the two teams who had previously been appointed 
were helpful here. Five events were used (1) pony race, (2) 
tandem hopping, (3) waist carry, (4) wheelbarrow, (5) donkey 
race. All of the races were conducted in the same general manner. 
To conduct the first race the newsboys were placed at the wall 
at one end. The boys who were to ride first mounted the hips of 
their partners. The riders each held one hand on the wall. On 
the signal “Go”’ the ponies ran for the opposite wall. On touching 
the wall the two exchanged positions—the pony became rider and 
the rider pony—and the new pony ran back to the starting wall. 
The instructor who acted as starter picked the first three to touch 
the wall. Any pair which fell over or failed to touch the far wall 
before exchanging places was eliminated ;—a big boy from another 
class served as judge in this. The non-newsboys then ran in the 
same way. The six winners—three from each group—were con- 
ducted through the finals. Places were awarded the first four to 
finish. I recall that in the first race of the six pairs that started 
in the finals only two pairs finished (all others were elminated) ; 
thus only first and second were awarded. 
In the tandem hopping race each pair touched the wall and 
turned and hopped back to the starting wall. Boys who touched 
the uplifted foot to the floor or became separated were eliminated. 
The waist carry race, wheelbarrow race and donkey race were 
all carried on as the pony race. 
The meet lasted a little over half an hour. The score was 
chalked on the wall as follows. (Table XXXII.)

Attention Meet. 
A so-called “attention meet” carried on with another group at 
the same institution also proved to be very successful. The thirty 
boys in the class were divided into four teams of seven each—two 
of the more athletic boys were selected to act as judges. The four 
teams were placed in line along one side-of the basketball court 
—there was a five-foot interval between teams. Ten events were 
used: (1) running, (2) all-fours, (3) crab walk, (4) hopping, 
(5) lame duck, (6) .reverse crab walk, (7) chariot, (members of 
each team linking elbows and running forward), (8) bear gallop, 
(9) double jumping, and (10) toe grasp. 
All of the events were conducted in the same general manner. 
Each. was described and demonstrated, and on the signal ‘‘Start” 
each team advanced to the opposite side of the basketball court 
where each stood in line at attention, facing toward the center. 
The team standing in line at attention first scored two points; the 
team arriving second, one point. In advancing to the opposite line 
each player traveled independently and stood at attention as soon as 
he crossed the line. Any player who failed to travel in the pre- 
scribed manner, or who arose to a run before crossing the line, 
eliminated his team from scoring in that event. After the first 
elimination and a short talk on fair play the competition went on 
fairly. The events were conducted alternately back and forth 
across the basketball court. The following diagram shows the plan 
of organization. (Dia. 51.)

Additional Events. 
In addition to the events included in the meets outlined in the 
preceding pages, we have a number of other events which can be 
used in this type of competition very successfully. 
Shot put Hurl ball target throw 
Hammer throw Grenade far throw 
Javelin throw Grenade throw for accuracy (trench 
Weight throw (35 pounds) target) 
Weight throw (56 pounds) Grenade throw for accuracy (circle target) 
Discus throw Bean bag board toss 
Discus throw (Greek style) Bean bag target toss 
Peg stretch Neck flip 
Ring. travel Horseshoe pitching 
Pirouette Volley ball serve for distance 
Wall climb Volley ball serve for accuracy 
Rope climb (free style) Tennis wall serve for accuracy 
“ Rope climb (hands only) Tennis court serve for accuracy 
Support swing jump Field hockey goal shoot 
Hurl ball far throw 
The first seven events are included in our regular track 
and field program, and of course provide excellent forms of 
competition. 
The pirouette was first used by the writer in 1916 at the Spring- 
field Boys’ Club. One day I happened to see a small group of boys 
trying to outturn each other. Noting the interest and spirit of 
competition that prevailed, I introduced the event with the boys’ 
classes, and from the beginning it was very popular. A diagram 
painted on the floor showing sixteen degrees of a complete turn 
served as an ever-present reminder, and during the intervals be- 
tween classes was almost continuously the scene of some friendly 
competition. Since then the event has been tried with different 
groups with excellent success. 
The climbing events are very easy to organize, and while they 
may not be so popular as some of the other events, they should be 
fostered and promoted for the training they provide. 
The support swing jump is rather difficult and if not supervised 
may result in injury. It should be used only with adult groups. 
The hurl ball is one of the most popular pieces of equipment 
on German and Swedish playgrounds. It makes an appeal to the 
hurling instinct and is not dangerous as is the hammer, discus and 
other weights. I believe it would be equally popular if introduced 
on our American playgrounds. The far throw and the accuracy 
throw can be used with all groups. 
The peg stretch is an old event popular with all groups a decade 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
MISCELLANEOUS ATHLETIC MEETS 251 
or two ago. It provides an interesting diversion for playground, 
school and informal use. 
The ring traveling event can only be used in gymnasiums and on 
playgrounds where traveling rings are installed. This event is 
such a splendid developer of the arms and upper body, however, 
that it should be given serious consideration for inclusion in all 
mass athletic and recreational programs. 
The grenade throws have been used in the army during and 
since the war and are generally conceded by those who have been 
associated with their use to be excellent events. They merit wider 
usage. Senior high school and college groups could use them well. 
The bean bag events have always been popular with grade school 
“kids” and their use should be fostered and increased. A bean 
bag athletic meet should prove very popular with first, second and 
third graders. 
Horseshoe pitching has been a folk pastime of the American 
people for centuries. Recently it has risen to the plane of a na- 
tional sport. The horseshoe pitching event can well be introduced 
in our athletic competitions. All groups can execute the event with 
equal facility. 
The volley ball serving and tennis serving events are peculiarly 
adapted for the upper grades and junior and senior high school 
groups. 
The field hockey goal shooting event is taken from the game of 
field hockey and is especially suited for use with groups of girls.

PREFACE 
VocationaL guidance is bound up first of all with 
educational problems, and second with economic and 
social questions. On this account the reader must not 
expect a book on the subject to offer anything like a 
complete program or solution of the problem. The 
breadth of the field considered in this book, however, 
should prove a distinct advantage to those readers who 
are willing to set aside the desire for short cuts and to 
work out thoughtful proposals for bettering hopeful but 
inadequate pioneering on the one hand and complete 
neglect on the other. 
If the movement for vocational guidance has so far 
proved but one thing, it is that the indefinite education 
for the vague thing called ‘‘ complete living” or “physical, 
mental, and moral development” must give way to a 
well-considered aiming at specific needs — needs such 
as those represented by the individual’s right, duty, and 
desire to fulfill family relationships, to vote intelligently, 
to maintain a good standard of living, and to codperate 
in all phases of endeavor for human good. These spe- 
cialized trainings are by no means narrow; it fs the 
indefinite education which has been narrow. 
Vocational guidance must _be considered as-different 
from vocational education ; the latter is concerned with

  _but one of the steps in adequate guidance, but its advo- 
“cates have too often neglected the other steps in the com- 
plete series. This complete series, so far as the individual 
is concerned, may be stated as follows: (1) Laying a 
broad foundation of useful experiences; (2) Studying 
occupational opportunities ; (3) Choosing an occupation ; 
(4) Preparing for the occupation; (5) Entering upon 
work; (6) Securing promotions and making readjust- 
ments. 
As a civic force, vocational guidance is concerned with 
increasing the knowledge of occupational problems, as a 
necessary basis for their codperative solution. As a 
moral force, the counselor must inculcate not only the 
personal virtues needed in the successful pursuit of one’s 
calling, but also the social helpfulness based on the under- 
standing that the codperative opportunities are greater. 
than the competitive, and on the theory of society, ‘“We 
are members one of another.” (As an agent of culture, 
vocational guidance seeks for harmonious and refined 
living in street, store, factory, shop, farm, and mine, as 
well as in the literary society and at the fireside) 
This book is offered as a contribution to the prepa- 
ration for the task ahead of us: it is the hope of the 
writer that it may become a part of the literature of the 
reconstruction. 
I thank Professor Paul H. Hanus for his guidance and 
criticism during the course of the investigation, and the 
other members of the Division of Education of Harvard 
University for occasional assistance and suggestion.

THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE 
MOVEMENT 
CHAPTER I 
il Tue purpose of this book is to make clear the problems 
with which the vocational-guidance movement deals; to 
examine and evaluate the attempts so far made to solve 
these problems in schools and in occupations ; and to pro- 
pose plans, in the light of what has already been accom- 
plished, for the further progress of the movement. The 
purpose of this chapter is to scrutinize the definitions and 
assumptions which underlie vocational guidance as its 
activities are carried on to-day. 
What is Vocational Guidance? —{ The common mean- 
ing of the two words in the phrase vocational guidance 
suggests that we are concerned with helping-persons.to 
choose,. prepare-for,.enter into, .and.make progress in 
occupations. Such activities as the following, then, 
would be considered as exemplifying vocational guidance : 
giving information about commerce and industry, in 
order to help in the choice of an occupation or a job; 
B I THE PROBLEMS OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE
-P-A-G-E-12
2 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
giving opportunity to discover talents, with the voca- 
tional choice in mind; advising pupils to enter this or 
that school, for the purpose of discovering their talents 
or preparing for an occupation; advising in regard to 
promotion, change of job, after-education, or advanced 
study; supervising the entrance into or progress in 
particular positions or chosen occupations. 
We shall assume that the rendering of such help to 
young people fairly represents vocational guidance, and 
shall proceed to a study of the problems involved in the 
process. 
“~The Importance of Vocational Guidance: One’s Oc- 
cupation as the Center of his Interest. — “‘ For the great 
masses of men, life is organized around work,” ! and this 
is the reason why it is important that every child have 
adequate vocational guidance. Eliot shows “ the value 
during education of the life-career motive.” ? He calls 
attention to the success with which the career motive is 
used in the professional schools, and in the lower schools 
wherever tried. He points out that there need be no 
danger of appealing too early to the career motive, since 
the child’s interests may be kept broad, and since he may 
be left free to change his plans at any time, without 
serious difficulty. 
The love that young children have for playing occupa- 
tions, the interest shown by pupils in those studies which 
they think are “ practical,” and the activity manifested

by children in making things, all indicate that if the 
adolescent boy or girl can be induced to select from five 
to ten occupations for consideration and study, his school 
work can be made to improve, his interest in observing 
the life about him increased, and his moral purposes 
deepened. Future family duties, possible activities of 
citizenship, moral and spiritual responsibilities, which 
still seem remote and hypothetical to the young mind 
— at least so far as the current modes of presenting these 
duties go — seem vague beside the effectiveness of the 
vocational appeal. 
The Bearing of the Vocation on Life. — Not only is 
the vocational appeal an insistent and obvious one; it 
frequently enforces the other duties of life. Thus, the 
logic in the title of a publication in this field, Vocational 
and Moral Guidance, is that there can be no true success 
in the vocation without sound morals.! 
Further, vocational jguidance inculcates ideals of 
citizenship. | _Not only should the pupil t be shown the 
economic valiek to the community in the kinds of work 
he is considering; he should also see how dependent he 
and his business or employment will be upon good govern- 
ment, just taxation, equal opportunity before the law, 
publicity in civic affairs, trustworthy sources of informa- 
tion, adequate recreational facilities, and a rectification 
1 Jesse B. Davis in this book cites the case of a boy who had all the 
mental and physical qualifications for a certain occupation, but failed 
through an uncontrolled temper (p. 87). Every counselor, as well as 
every enlightened employer, knows that certain qualities such as kind- 
ness, courtesy, and willingness to be of service are indispensable.
-P-A-G-E-14
4 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
of economic injustices. The boy with a career in mind 
is in a better position to study these things effectively. 
The wise settlement of the question of vocation sets 
free other life interests, which then gain direction and 
impulse, and are allowed to proceed toward a well- 
rounded development. If the question of occupation is 
unwisely settled, or left overlong unsettled, there may 
develop distrust, pessimism, and temptation, and 
finally immorality and bad citizenship. e 
The Need for Vocational Guidance is Obvious. — 
The writings on vocational guidance contain adequate 
discussions of the need for the work, and we shall say 
little on this topic here. Bloomfield! justifies his term 
“vocational anarchy,” and both he and Philip Davis 
show how the suggestions of the street now determine 
occupations for the young people.” Such good studies 
of the need have been made that no student of the prob- 
lem fails to see it as an urgent demand? Yet the 
public mind moves slowly, and the education of com- 
munity opinion needs to be extended greatly. 
The amount and character of the false guidance which 
goes on is proof enough that the schools and other 
educational agencies should take up the work. Worse 
than quack medicines, because they poison the mind 
rather than the body, these attempts to give advice, 
and to charge money for it, are crying aloud to young 
1 Youth, etc., pp. 3-5. 2 Streetland, Chs. 6 and 7.

Readings, pp. 30-31.

THE PROBLEMS OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 5 
people just at the age when their desires for experimen- 
tation and self-discovery are greatest. In a prominent 
statistical annual, issued by a New York newspaper, 
and frequently used by high-school debaters, there are 
several advertisements which should cause concern to 
those interested in vocational guidance. One is headed, 
“strengthen your will’’; another offers to tell how to 
master others and make them do as you wish; another 
offers to read your life; three to teach hypnotism; 
another to build your memory so that it will never 
fail. 
We have pointed out above that happiness, good _cit- 
izenship, morality, and social usefulness are frequently 
bound up with the choice of a vocation. Such a momen- 
tous choice can no longer be left to chance. 
What Vocational Guidance is not. Attempts to 
Limit the Field.— No one step or operation in the 
systematic process of advising a person about his voca- 
tion can be singled out and labeled vocational guidance. 
We shall not quarrel with an attempt to discover which 
step is the most important, but we shall take exception 
to certain prevalent assumptions that the field is limited 
to any one act or any one period of the child’s life. If 
the ordinary meanings of English words are to hold 
good here, no single step can be called “ the heart of 
vocational guidance.” 
Placement Alone is not Adequate Vocational Guidance. 
— In the introductory statement of a recent article we 
find this sentence:
-P-A-G-E-16
  
  6 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Indeed the act of placing a boy or girl in that job which 
will be suited to his or her abilities, future welfare, health, 
and happiness, might almost be offered as a definition of 
vocational guidance.! 
Perhaps the “almost” should save the statement 
from challenge, but the definition is a prevalent one, and 
there are many so-called “ vocational-guidance ”’ officers, 
both in school departments and in other institutions, 
whose whole time is taken up with placement and the 
investigations necessary thereto. 
We shall discuss in a later chapter the appropriate 
subordination of placement to other activities of voca- 
tional guidance (Chap. IV); our aim here is merely to 
point out that we cannot accept the statement that 
placement is almost the whole of guidance. Obvious 
needs, trustworthy experience, and good practice, as 
we shall see, as well as the meaning of words, prevent 
such a restricted definition.” 
1 Odencrantz, p. 169. Aside from the present issue on definition, one 
taay fairly ask, Is there any one job which will satisfy these tests ? 
? The breadth of the field is shown by this extract from Bloomfield, 
Youth, School, and Vocation : 
To some people, indeed, the placement features of vocational guidance 
are alone practical, while the efforts looking to a reorganization of school 
and vocational opportunity in terms of career-values, which may be 
said to be the mainspring of the vocational-guidance movement, appear 
to them as a commendable though rather remote ideal. 
The truth is, however, that vocational guidance does concern itself 
with all the problems of work-getting, with helping children to a start 
in life in a way less wasteful than the present, and with active super- 
vision of youth’s vocational skirmishes (p. 158).
-P-A-G-E-17
  
THE PROBLEMS OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 7 
Guidance is not a Temporary Act.— One writer 
remarks: 
Since vocational guidance has to do with the “start in 
life,’ and since it necessitates an articulation between the 
school and occupations, the time at which it may be exercised 
most intelligently is that at which the pupil leaves school. 
It is true that the writer of the foregoing quotation 
goes on to show that for some pupils he plans guidance 
before that time, and guidance after leaving for most 
of them. But does not the statement as it stands 
have the effect — unintentionally, no doubt — of limit- 
ing the application of vocational guidance to one period 
and one activity? A Cambridge lumber company uses 
in its advertising placards the expression, “ Sudden 
Service.” Such service may be rendered by a lumber 
company; can it be profitably rendered by a voca- 
tional counselor? Patent considerations point to the 
answer: If the program of vocational guidance is to 
be adequate to the great task with which it deals, 
it must provide for a study of the successes of the child 
during the years before he can possibly go to work. No 
other plan could yield the data necessary for guidance. 
Further, the school-leaving time, with its atmosphere 
disturbed by many influences, is hardly the psychological 
1 Leavitt, Frank M., The School Phases of Vocational Guidance, p. 688. 
That the writer has a broad conception of the duty of vocational 
guidance is shown in his address at the Richmond Convention, as presi- 
dent of the National Vocational-Guidance Association, which see. See 
also his article in The American Journal of Sociology.
-P-A-G-E-18
8 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
moment to apply systematic vocational guidance, even 
if it were possible to confine it to one period. Due to 
the very nature and complexity of the problems involved, 
vocational guidance cannot be satisfactory without a 
program which follows the development of the individ- 
ual over a number of years. 
Vocational Guidance is not merely “ Practical” or 
“ Idealistic.”” — In the article last quoted, the statement 
is made: 
In developing a program for vocational guidance, there- 
fore, we must distinguish clearly between the immediate and 
the ultimate purpose, and must realize that the “next step” 
is the most important consideration (p. 687). 
No doubt this is just half the truth, and perhaps 
not the fundamental half. In counseling an individual 
child we could’ hardly say that the next step is a con- 
sideration more important than his ultimate goal. 
Such a policy would savor too strongly of the vaudeville 
song, “I don’t know where I’m going, but I’m on my 
way !” We may fairly ask, Can the vocational- 
guidance movement, any more than an individual, 
afford to take next steps without first attempting to 
ascertain in what direction these steps lead? The two 
ideals must be irrevocably bound together. We do not 
need to slight the importance of one in holding in mind 
the other. 
But it may be said that economic conditions make it 
impossible for the teacher to widen vocational oppor- 
tunity, and that therefore he should concern himself
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE PROBLEMS OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 9 
rather with meeting practical situations as they exist 
to-day. It is said in the same article: 
It is futile to talk about the value of the life-career motive 
in the guidance of this group, for most will have to be con- 
tented with “jobs” for many years, and perhaps may never 
enter upon a genuine “career” or “vocation.” (The group 
referred to is “The group which leaves school at the termina- 
tion of the compulsory age limit with about an eighth-grade 
training.”) [P. 689.] 
Undoubtedly school people need to pay more attention 
to practical aims and to practical education. At the 
same time, however, they need to add their influence 
to the forces working for civic, social, and political 
betterment. The child must not be set into a place and 
left to do all the conforming ; he must be taught to apply 
his control to the forces which seem to hem him in. In 
order to show him how to do this, the teacher himself 
must participate in the control. In the words of Devine: 
The omnipresent local social economist is the school. The 
assumption of social responsibility for poverty, disease, and 
crime clearly involves the transformation of the school. . . . 
The social economist holds that the prevention of poverty, 
disease, and crime is the first, elementary, fundamental 
obligation of the public school system.! 
Vocational Guidance must not Restrict Opportunity. — 
Closely related to the foregoing discussion is the ques- 
tion: Does vocational guidance aim to widen the 
opportunity for the “common people,” or to restrict 
1 Quoted by President Leavitt, Nat. Voc. Guidance Assn., 1914, p. 5. 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
10 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
it? For the query is frequently raised: After all, can 
there be a wide freedom of choice, at least for the greater 
number of children? According to Schneider? the 
number of “ energizing ” jobs is decreasing; how then, 
it is asked, can we be so shortsighted as to make more 
skilled workers? Shall we not, if we cling to democratic 
ideals, educate children for work they can never find? 
What guidance can we give those manifestly destined 
for the unskilled occupations? What shall we do— 
indeed, what can we do—for the child who leaves 
school to begin work at the end of the sixth or seventh 
grade? What shall we do with the boy with extravagant 
ambitions? Thus Sears expresses concern that some 
seventh and eighth grade boys had not yet decided upon 
an occupation : 
Little can be said as to the meaning of this, but if it really 
means that that per cent [ten per cent] of boys are not pre- 
disposed toward some calling, then perhaps “nurture” in 
place of “nature”? must constitute itself the sole guide in 
the matter, and in the light of the industrial demand for 
workers, and its best judgment of child nature, train these 
boys to become responsible members of the community 
(p. 752). 
and again: 
The boys are to too large an extent aiming at something 
they can never reach. The function of the schools is first 
to rationalize those aspirations, and then to carry forward 
the present plans for occupational training suggested above, 
which the writer has observed in successful operation in at

  THE PROBLEMS OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE It 
least one large vocational school in the city (Oakland). 
[P. 756.] 
We shall deal with these issues later (Chap. V). 
For the present, however, we may note one or two 
objections, and indicate possible alternatives. First, 
there is no reason why seventh and eighth grade boys 
and girls should be required to decide on their occupa- 
tions. Second, the school must avoid interfering with 
the plans of individuals, and must confine its efforts to 
other channels. Third, guidance cannot pass into proph- 
ecy — out of twenty would-be lawyers it will be im- 
possible to tell which are the two or three who will reach 
the goal. Finally, there are other ways in which these 
problems may be attacked: we may take our part in 
a campaign to improve the tasks and the recreational 
opportunities of the unskilled; we may instruct the 
children about the character of the problems ahead of 
them if they choose difficult roads; and we may make 
it easier for the child to change his aim when necessary, 
without any loss of self-respect. 
If vocational guidance is to serve a state committed 
to democratic principles, it cannot proceed otherwise 
than through striving for open opportunity based on 
breadth of vocational intelligence. 
Vocational Guidance does not Mean Classifying 
Children and Prescribing Occupations. — There is no 
authority in definition, theory, or practice for prescrib- 
ing vocations or classifying children; for neither activity 
is there any right or possibility. In spite of the confident   
     
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
attempts to classify, psychological analyses have not yet 
reached trustworthy results.1_ Vocational guidance does 
not mean that older people will impose ideas upon the 
children ; the business of the teacher is rather to provide 
the environment in which each child will make for him- 
self the series of choices which will determine his course 
of life./ 
Summary. — Turning again to the definition we have 
assumed, — that_vocational guidance is concerned with 
helping persons choose, prepare for, enter into, and make 
progress in occupations — we are now able to compare 
the details of this statement with those activities which 
we have said vocational guidance is not. In brief, 
help in taking any single one of these steps in vocational 
progress, taken by itself, cannot be claimed to be the 
sum and substance of vocational guidance; and further, 
the guidance given the child must be both practical and 
idealistic, continued long enough to be based upon accu- 
rate knowledge of the child, aimed at broadening his op- 
portunity, and free from classification and prescription. 
What is Educational Guidance ? — Conscious effort 
to assist in the intellectual growth of an individual is 
educational guidance. The following acts will serve 
as examples: telling about the arithmetic needed in a 
certain trade; aiding in the choice of a course or a school ; 
1 There are types of thinking, but we cannot say that there are types 
of mind. Vocational guidance cannot afford to wait on psychology, 
though it may use whatever constructive results are offered. The 
danger with using the theory that there are types of children we shall 
discuss in Chapter V.
-P-A-G-E-23
THE PROBLEMS OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 13 
helping in plans to return to school; advising one to 
broaden his curriculum by studying music; advising a 
worker to transfer to another department in order to 
learn a new kind of work; telling how to play a game. 
Anything which has to do with instruction or with learn- 
ing may come under the term educational guidance. 
Most educational guidance is also vocational guidance. 
But when it has to do strictly with social, civic, rec- 
reational, and moral affairs, though it may bear in- 
directly on the occupation, it cannot be called vocational 
guidance in the strict sense of the term. For example, 
advising a child to study Latin merely to broaden his 
outlook is educational but not vocational guidance. On 
the other hand, helping a boy to secure a promotion in 
his occupation is an act of vocational but not of educa- 
tional guidance. 
The distinction depends on the purpose involved: 
whether to improve the child’s vocational chances, or to 
advance his education. 
(The chief educational guidance needed at the present 
time, and the chief way it can serve the vocation of the 
child, is advice about, and improvement of, his schooling, 
It is for this reason that Bloomfield speaks of educational 
guidance as the first step in vocational guidance, and 
says further: 
The question of choice of a life-work involves quite as 
much selecting the right kind of further schooling as the 
right vocation.!

14 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
How Vocational Education Helps Guidance. The 
Prevocational Idea. — In this choice of further schooling 
vocational guidance is no longer dependent on mere 
advice; vocational education has provided for experi- 
mentation and actual preparation. Experimentation 
comes through the prevocational school (see Glossary, 
App. I), in which the child is successively allowed to 
participate in several kinds of mental and manual 
activities, for the purpose of self-discovery. There is 
no purpose to favor the manual studies, but only to 
provide both manual and academic studies, in order that 
broad activity, correlation between theory and practice, 
extended vision, and more intelligent choice may result. 
The following statement of aims is significant : 
The advocates of early vocational education have no 
fear that their propaganda will endanger liberal education. 
On the contrary, they hold that the reorganization of ed- 
ucation on a vocational basis will give motive for extended 
education and thus provide time and opportunity for liberal 
culture. They advocate the education of the individual 
along the lines of his greatest endowment and as broadly 
as possible. The antiquated liberal plan assumed that those 
who found books too much for them would drift into the 
ranks of the manual workers and get on as best they could 
there. In abandoning this view it is not necessary to go to 
the opposite extreme, namely, that pupils should be tested 
and all who prove to be skillful with their hands be trained 
for the trades and those who show no aptitude for handiwork 
be left to drift into the professions. The one test is no more 
decisive than the other. Of the two, however, the second 
is less fraught with danger, for in the shop as well as in the
-P-A-G-E-25
  
THE PROBLEMS OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 15 
classroom there is opportunity to discover pupils who are 
fitted to deal with theories and general application of ideas,' 
Vocational Training. -— The second service rendered by 
vocational education is the actual training given those 
who have decided on their occupations. This training 
may be given in a trade school, a codperative or part- 
time school, a commercial or technical day or night 
high school, or a college or professional school; how- 
ever rendered it is a significant aid to efficient vocational 
guidance. 
Our study has so far considered the generai problem 
with which vocational guidance deals, the importance 
of the work, the false assumptions, and the relationship 
of vocational to educational guidance and vocational 
education. We shall next attempt to analyze the prob- 
lem — to state the main questions with which vocational 
guidance, in school and in the occupations, is concerned. 
The School Problems of Vocational Guidance. — 
The following lists of questions indicate three things: 
(z) the extent and importance of the field; (2) the prob- 
lems with which present efforts to furnish vocational 
help are concerned; (3) the topics with which this book 
will deal. The questions in this section will furnish the 
basis for the study in the next four chapters.

The Occupational Problems of Vocational Guidance. — 
Many of the questions in the preceding list relate to the 
occupation as well as the school. Following are some 
additional topics which concern commerce and industry 
more directly. Consideration of these problems will 
appear also in some of the early chapters of this book, 
and especially in Chapters VI and VII.

  CHAPTER II 
BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
THE field of vocational guidance is so wide, its activities 
so varied, and its development so recent, that no study 
can include all the present plans in one comprehensive 
survey. Many schools have for years done vocational 
counseling, but have received new stimulus and aid from 
the interest developed by Frank Parsons less than ten 
years ago. Our purpose in this chapter is to present and 
criticize certain typical plans actually in operation at the 
present time. This examination will form the basis both 
for a program of practices which have been tried and 
found helpful, and for a possible statement of what 
remains still to be accomplished. It is not claimed that 
the plans here examined are the best that can be found, 
but that they fairly represent the vocational-guidance 
movement as it expresses itself to-day. 
Early Recognition of the Importance of Guidance. — 
It is as difficult to trace the beginnings of vocational 
guidance as to trace the discovery of the use of steam. 
Who did the most, — the man who saw the need, the one 
who told the world about it, or the one who took the 
first step toward the solution of the problem? Many 
persons have appreciated the need of vocational guidance 
20
-P-A-G-E-31
  BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 2r 
through reading Plato’s Republic, and yet have done 
‘nothing to work out any plan. In 1670, Pascal stated 
‘the importance of a wise choice of occupation. The 
j ntroductory staternent of a vocational-guidance docu- 
rnent published in England in 1747 is placed at the 
beginning of Bloomfield’s book, Readings in Vocational 
Gividance. In 1795 Henry MacKenzie wrote: 
Indeed, the education of .your_youth-is.everyway_pre- 
posterous ; you waste at school-years-in-improving talents, 
without having ever discovered them; one promiscuous 
line of instruction is followed, without regard to genius, 
capacity, or probable situation in the commonwealth. ! 
Again, all the cults having to do with prediction and 
prescription — the astrologers, the palm and card 
readers, the phrenologists, physiognomists, mediums, 
and seers — recognized the importance of and were con- 
cerned with vocational adaptations. Was vocational 
guidance, like chemistry, astronomy, biology, and other 
sciences, born in pseudo-knowledge? If so, we must be 
alert in our study to search out the line of true progress. 
In 1881 a little book was published which can perhaps 
claim to be the first book wholly devoted to the actual 
subject of choosing a vocation. It is a curious volume, 
but full of the need for vocational guidance and of the 
service to be rendered. The author, Lysander S. 
Richards, attempted to coin the word “ Vocophy ”’ for 
the title. The naive point of view is shown in an extract 
from the preface : 
‘1 Man of Feeling, p. 48. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
All we claim to perform is to bring order out of chance 
and chaos, and form or establish a system to enable a person 
to find the most fitting pursuit in which he can reap the 
greatest success that is possible for him individually to attairi. 
The book does nothing more than to point the need. 
Richards favors phrenology, though he points out its limi- 
tations. His aim was to have expert prescribersin each city. 
He made little provision for study of the occupations, and 
even in his study of the individual he tells chiefly what 
occupations to avoid rather than what to follow. i 
The Beginning of Genuine Vocational Guidance. — 
Frank Parsons is justly called the founder of the voca- 
tional- guidance movement, for it was he who began the 
work which has led to the present spread of interest. 
Parsons discarded the pseudo-sciences, used the sys- 
tematic study of the occupations, and was sane and 
painstaking in the investigations of character and 
abilities which he made. Further, he wrote about his 
work, and thus gave to the followers in the movement an 
opportunity to build on his gains. His book, Choosing 
a Vocation, will perhaps have a permanent place in 
vocational-guidance bibliographies. Its critics recognize 
its value; at most only one objection to the method can 
be raised: Parsons was a bit too sure in his conclusions 
— too prescriptive in what he told the individuals who 
consulted him.' It should be noted that the scope of 
1 Bound up with this difficulty is the further fact that the “self- 
analysis” plan he used is over-elaborated and dependent upon a false 
psychology. His emphasis on choosing a vocation led many people te 
the belief that this is the sole function of vocational guidance.
-P-A-G-E-33
BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 23 
the work and of the book is limited: guidance in the 
school, placement, and follow-up work, and guidance 
accompanying employment are not vital parts of the 
plan. The guidance Parsons offered was intensive, but it 
did not extend over a long period of the individual’s life. 
The Civic Service House, Boston, in which Professor 
Parsons began his counseling, was organized in 1901 by 
Meyer Bloomfield. In 1903 Philip Davis, the present 
director, came as assistant. They became interested in 
the writings, social outlook, and practical aims of Parsons, 
and under his direction the Breadwinners’ Institute 
was organized. This work with immigrant young men 
and women brought to a focus all Parsons’ latent interest 
in vocational guidance, and steps were at once taken to 
organize a vocation bureau. This was in the early 
weeks of 1908. On April 23, 1908, the organization of 
the Vocation Bureau was completed, with a substantial 
board of directors as sponsors for the movement. Mrs. 
Quincy A. Shaw (Pauline Agassiz Shaw), who aided 
many other progressive educational movements, financed 
the work. On May 1, Parsons made his initial report 
to the board. Just before the summer, students about 
to graduate from an evening high school were invited 
to confer with Parsons, and considerable counseling was 
carried on. In the fall he continued the work of the 
Bureau, at the Civic Service House, and also gave part 
of his time to similar work at other institutions. Late in 
the same year (1908) Parsons died. 
During the early months of 1909 plans were perfected
-P-A-G-E-34
    
24 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
for reorganizing and carrying on the bureau, and Bloom- 
field assumed charge of the work as director. At first 
several other civic organizations codperated in the direc- 
tion of the enterprise, but before many months the bureau 
attained to the dignity of an independent institution. 
It was very soon after this time that the bureau was asked 
to begin the organization of the work in the Boston city 
schools. 
It was from these beginnings that the movement for 
vocational guidance has spread. The term “ vocational 
guidance ” is mew — during the few years since 1908 it 
has assumed nation-wide significance. We shall now 
turn to an examination of the activities of the movement 
as expressed in various parts of the country, beginning 
with Boston, the birthplace. 
The Vocation Bureau of Boston: Past Activities. — 
The Boston Vocation Bureau has done much important 
work. Among its activities may be mentioned the 
following : 
- 1. Establishment of vocational guidance in the Boston 
\ schools, and of training courses for Boston teachers. 
2. Summer-school courses in Harvard University, rorr, 
1912, and 1913; and in the University of California, 1914 and 
1915. Courses in Indiana University, the State Normal 
School at Greeley, Colorado; year courses at Boston Uni- 
versity beginning 1913-14, and at Teachers College, Col- 
umbia University, beginning 1916-17. 
3. Holding of First National Conference on Vocational 
Guidance, in codperation with the Boston Chamber of Com- 
merce, 1910.
-P-A-G-E-35

4. Publication of The Vocational Guidance of Youth, 
IgII. 
5. Publication of pamphlets and books on trades, busi- 
nesses, and professions. 
6. Investigation of vocational guidance in Europe and 
in Porto Rico, and publication of The School and the Start 
in Life, 1914. 
7. Organizing of the Boston Employment Managers’ 
Association, 1911. 
8. Publication of Youth, School, and Vocation; and of 
Readings in Vocational Guidance, 1915. 
9. Publication of Business Employments, and The Shoe 
Industry, 1916. 
io. Correspondence, conferences, interviews, lectures, 
as noted in the list of present activities, below. 
The Present Work of the Bureau. — At the present 
time the Boston bureau is not primarily engaged in 
giving vocational counsel to individuals, but is more 
especially concerned with carrying on investigations, 
publishing bulletins, drawing up plans for schools and 
school systems, and in others ways furthering the 
growth and development of the idea of guidance. 
The duty of a bureau to aid teachers, employers, and 
school directors is thus stated : 
It is the special business of a vocation bureau to organize 
that conscious and continuous service which takes hold of 
the child when the life-career motive has been awakened, 
and helps guide, strengthen, and protect it, particularly 
through the transition crisis between school and work.! 
1 Bloomfield, Youth, etc., p. 47. A systematic outline of the aims of 
the bureau is given on page 39.
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Following is a partial list of the present attempts of the 
Boston Vocation Bureau to be of service in this field: 
1. Correspondence about plans and policies. 
2. Conference with persons wishing actual guidance. 
3- Conferences with school people, employers, labor 
unions, social workers, legislators. 
4. A course in Vocational Guidance at Boston Univer- 
sity and at Teachers College, Columbia University. 
5. Lectures by the director and assistant director for 
associations, schools, clubs, etc. 
6. Investigations leading to publications on occupations. 
7. Maintenance of a library of material on vocational 
guidance and vocational education, open to the public. 
8. Conferences with and aid to students of colleges and 
universities who are investigating vocational-guidance. 
g. Assistance in the organization and direction of em- 
ployment managers’ associations, in Boston, Philadelphia, 
San Francisco, and New York. (See p. 125.) 
to. Assistance in planning vocational-guidance confer- 
ences and conventions. 
11. Organization of a plan for vocational help to minors, 
for the New York public schools. 
Counseling at the Boston Bureau. — The reason the 
bureau no longer aims to put the chief emphasis on exten- 
sive counseling of individuals is expressed as follows in 
the 1915 report: 
The Vocation Bureau believes that the most effective 
vocational counseling comes through close association with 
individuals or groups. It does not believe that as a rule 
stranger can well counsel stranger. Therefore one main 
effort of the Bureau has been to secure the appointment and
-P-A-G-E-37
BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 27 
adequate training of those who are best situated for the right 
relationship with applicants for vocational help. 
A counselor in a school system or in a business establish- 
ment is in a good position not only to observe the needs and 
growth of an individual but also to secure codperation in 
judgment and personal service from those who are equally 
interested in a particular individual’s welfare. 
In spite of this policy there are calls at the bureau 
from persons wanting counsel, and these requests are not 
refused. Many come, however, for aid in finding work, 
and in such cases the Bureau can only refer them to 
other organizations. Applicants for advice are fre- 
quently counseled to seek the aid of responsible people 
of good judgment who have known them for a long period 
of time. 
The following tabulation is based on a study of 133 
case cards on file in the Vocation Bureau. They were 
chosen at random, and are only a portion of the many 
cases considered by the bureau.

The foregoing tabulation shows that many persons 
have the impression that the bureau can help them find 
work. It shows, too, that there is a need for sources 
of advice and information for many persons far beyond 
the school age. 
Requests for Counsel by Mail. — “ It is absolutely im- 
possible to give any vocational counsel by mail. Only 
harm can result from such an attempt.” This is a sample 
answer of the bureau to one of the many letters re- 
questing advice. Much of this correspondence came 
from those who had read Parsons’ book, and some was 
the result of newspaper misdirection. For example, a
-P-A-G-E-39
BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 29 
‘Sunday edition, in reporting the work of the bureau, 
made it appear that advice by mail was given. And 
an efficiency expert, writing in a well-known magazine, 
was guilty of this statement: “ If you want to know what 
is your supreme talent, write to the Vocation Bureau of 
Boston.” The resulting letters are pathetic in their 
appeal. One can imagine that great disappointment 
came to individuals who could receive no answer com- 
mensurate with their hopes. 
Following is a tabulation of the characteristics of the 
letters, and of the replies to them:

Only a few of the letters told about the education or 
employment of the writers: thirty-four said that they 
were at work but dissatisfied, eight that they were in 
school, eight in college, and sixteen out of employment. 
The letters were from all parts of the United States, 
and seven were from foreign countries. Why should a 
boy about to graduate from a high school in Iowa write to 
Boston for information on finding his occupation? What 
are the resources for advice open to a man of 46 who 
has tried several occupations with indifferent success? 
These are serious questions with which the schools, the 
city, and the vocational-guidance people will have to 
concern themselves. 
Occasional letters still come to the bureau in which the 
problems of a life are laid bare, and while schools are 
inadequate and economic conditions crassly competitive 
such letters are likely to be written to any vocation 
bureau. Since the reply is so eagerly expected and advice
-P-A-G-E-41
BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 3r 
so sorely needed, and since a short letter may seem 
brusque and is always disappointing, it seems best to 
have a printed or stenciled form which can be sent in 
reply, in case it is not possible to send a personal note. 
Future Plans of the Vocation Bureau of Boston. — 
The reputation of the Boston bureau has been carried 
far beyond the borders of this country, and the thought 
of vocational guidance has gone with the name. Re- 
cently there was received a book from Uruguay with 
translations from The Vocational Guidance of Youth, and 
Chinese pamphlets on vocational education have referred 
to the bureau and its work. 
At the present time two important lines of work are 
being undertaken by the director of the bureau, Mr. 
Bloomfield: the perfecting of plans for an experiment in 
vocational help in three New York schools and a system- 
atic study of the qualifications, duties and opportunities 
of the employment manager (Chap. IV). The director 
has recently given two courses in vocational guidance at 
Teachers College, Columbia University. 
The assistant director, Mr. Frederick J. Allen, is 
devoting most of his time to the preparation of studies of 
the occupations. His book, The Shoe Industry, recently 
issued by the bureau, is of use not only as a guide to 
those who may wish to enter, and to intelligent workers 
in the industry, but to business men and manufacturers 
as well. His Business Employments aims to bring up to 
date, enlarge, and reprint the various studies made during 
the past six years. Allen divides the occupational field 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  32 THE VOCATIONAL~GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
roughly into three sections: business, trades, and pro- 
fessions. Business Employments aims to survey the 
first field; The Shoe Industry is one study in the second ; 
and The Law as a Vocation represents the third. It is 
hoped that the bureau may find opportunity to survey 
the last two fields — trades and professions — making 
three excellent texts for schools, vocational counselors, 
and other friends of youth.! 
Vocational-Guidance Department, Boston Public 
Schools. —It was the establishment of the Boston 
Vocation Bureau which led to the work of vocational 
guidance in the Boston schools. The beginnings were ex- 
plained by Superintendent Brooks at the first vocational 
guidance conference, held in Boston in 1910.2 Brooks’s 
report for 1911 advocated an investigation of the voca- 
tions of the community, an examination of the school 
system, work with parents and teachers, and follow-up. 
Committees codperated, under the direction of the 
Vocation Bureau, many meetings were held, teachers 
giving time to the work, men drawn directly from occupa- 
tions gave explanations of their field, high school prin- 
cipals told of the aims and methods of their schools, and 
later district conferences were held. The work has gone 
1 Through a plan recently consummated, Mr. Bloomfield now gives 
full time to industrial counseling, particularly in relation to the estab- 
lishment of departments of employment management. The Vocation 
Bureau, now called The Bureau of Vocational Guidance, is under charge 
of the Division of Education and the Graduate School of Business 
Administration, Harvard University, and Mr. Roy W. Kelly, Instructor 
in Education, is the director. 2 See Readings, pp. 83-91.
-P-A-G-E-43
  
BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 33 
on continuously, in spite of the fact that counselors in the 
elementary schools have done their work without any 
allowance of time or money. The 1916 survey of the 
schools for the Finance Commission led to the following 
statement : 
The work in vocational guidance is probably as well 
organized and administered in Boston as in any of our Ameri- 
can cities. The work is undoubtedly of much value and 
deserves further study. 
The committee believes that Boston will do well to expand 
its work in this field (Chap. VI). 
The Central Office. — The vocational office, in charge 
of the director, Miss Susan Ginn, aims to be an aid 
to the appointed counselors in each school. These local 
counselors in most cases do the actual advising. Assist- 
ants in the central office are engaged in three kinds of 
work: investigating occupations, giving counsel to such 
students and working children as call at the office, and 
aiding in the placement of high school students and 
graduates.1 
Much educational guidance is carried on by this 
department, the most striking evidence of which was the 
1 The central office is a codrdinating force to draw together a body of 
information about practices and successes throughout the city. It isa 
clearing house for experimentation, methods, and ways and means. A 
few general conferences are held, and frequent district conferences, in 
which high and elementary school teachers exchange points of view, 
and needs of particular sections of the city are discussed and investigated, 
and typical cases needing direction are considered. At a recent meeting 
of the counselors, there were present about 300 teachers. Such a meeting 
argues well for the interest in vocational guidance in the Boston schools.

34 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Annual Report of the School Committee for 1912. This 
report is addressed to the fathers and mothers of Boston, 
and is full of information about the schools: require- 
ments, diagrams, pictures, vocational training, suggest- 
ing courses, special classes, etc. Miss Ginn maintains 
that with high school attendance assured, the problem 
of the vocational counselors in the elementary schools 
is concerned chiefly with aiding the child in the selection 
of a high school course.! 
The counselors in the Boston schools have used the 
pamphlets of the Boston Vocation Bureau, and many of 
them have taken the training course conducted by Bloom- 
field, either in the classes under the auspices of the bureau 
and the school committee or in those maintained by 
Harvard University or Boston University. The work of 
the Vocation Department could probably be made more 
effective as a clearing house of information on guidance 
if there were a larger library at the central office. Each 
school has been furnished with a few books and pamphlets 
on occupations. 
The Boston plan seems to lack effective centralization ; 
the work is advisory and permissive. Were the director 
1 It is to be pointed out, however, that this selection cannot be made 
with intelligence and foresight unless the child has discovered his bent 
or probable occupation, and this for many is impossible at this age. 
It is the plan in Boston, as soon as financial conditions can be met, 
to give time allowance to counselors in the grades, so that their work 
may be done more effectively. This was announced by Assistant 
Superintendent Thompson, in the meeting above referred to, as was 
also the fact that a booklet is being planned, so that some elementary 
statement of fact and policy may aid the counselor in the work.
-P-A-G-E-45
  
BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 35 
able to require definite work in the elementary and high 
schools, especially in the giving of vocational information, 
better results might be expected. Voluntary work, 
nevertheless, shows interest, and a good foundation for 
comprehensive guidance undoubtedly exists. 
Guidance in the Boston High Schools. — The Voca- 
tional-Guidance Department has little direct control 
over the guidance in the Boston high schools. During 
the closing weeks of the school year members of the staff 
personally interview each member of the graduating 
classes, and also make an effort to aid in placement. 
Aside from this help, however, there seems to be no 
direction given to high school work, each school working 
out its own plan. In most of the schools two or more 
teachers are allowed part-time for counseling individuals, 
but there seems to be no committee of codperation 
between the several schools, and no attempt to supervise 
the work. It is well done or indifferently done, appar- 
ently, according to the interest and enthusiasm of the 
individual principal or counselor. Much profit would 
undoubtedly come from joint action in setting up a 
program of minimum requirement for vocational guid- 
ance. 
In the schools which take greatest interest in guidance 
efficient work seems to be done. Superintendent Brooks 
describes the work as it stood in 1910.1 Since that time 
there has been a growth of interest and effort, and the 
lectures, vocational talks, care in selecting high schools, 
1 See Readings, p. 83.
-P-A-G-E-46
36 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
and summer and part-time work have been continued 
and extended. A recent development is the Monday 
and Saturday work in department stores by girls who 
are in the last year of high school. 
Many of the Boston schools make systematic efforts 
to find places for their graduates. 
Boston System Progressive. — The Boston work and 
plans are commendable and promising. Effort is made 
to differentiate the school program, vocational outlook 
is widened early in the elementary school, advice comes 
some time ahead of placement, efforts are made to keep 
children in school, an attempt is made to safeguard 
the critical time of school leaving, placement is carefully 
done, and follow-up is provided for. Of late years a 
corps of college students has given time to interviewing 
employers for the department. The Boston School 
Committee holds examinations for vocational assistants 
— clearly a step in advance. 
Before the Boston system can be said to have an ade- 
quate, city-wide plan for guidance, however, it would 
seem necessary to work out a set of minimum essentials 
such as we shall discuss at a later place, and then to 
provide for authoritative supervision of the effort and 
accomplishment. 
Unguided Foreigners in Boston. — One of the guidance 
problems yet to be solved in Boston, and in other Ameri- 
can cities as well, is due to the presence of foreigners in 
the schools, particularly in the night schools. It is 
common knowledge among settlement workers that
-P-A-G-E-47
  
BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 37 
adults come from Italy and other countries equipped with 
skilled trades, but must take to street work, peddling, or 
farming because they do not know the language or cannot 
get work. The drift of foreigners into certain unskilled 
trades is at present inevitable, regardless of their aims 
and abilities. It is reported that the girls who work in 
one of the Atlantic Avenue candy factories, looking out 
of the window at an incoming liner from Italy, remarked, 
“ Here comes another load of chocolate dippers.” These 
young persons must attend night school until they can 
speak English, and this would seem to be the oppor- 
tunity for vocational guidance; but thus far little has 
been done. A sympathetic principal — one who believes 
in the races he is trying to help — should be given the 
resources to experiment with plans for meeting this need. 
The guidance in the Boston continuation school and 
prevocational centers will be considered in Chapter III. 
The Grand Rapids Plan. — The work in the Boston 
schools began with the Vocation Bureau, and thence was 
transplanted to the schools; that in Grand Rapids grew 
up in the schoolroom first and then was extended and 
organized in a central office. 
The work in Grand Rapids is expounded in a recent 
publication.!_ This book is an invaluable aid to English 
teachers, for it shows in a practical way how written 
composition may be used to develop the interests of 
the child and to give him experience in and knowledge of 
the problems he will have to face. The plan is systemati- 
1 Davis, Jesse B., Vocational and Moral Guidance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
cally worked out, and proceeds step by step through the 
series of choices that the normal child has to make in the 
course of his education and economic progress. It is 
the result of conference and coéperation on the part of 
the teachers in both high and elementary schools. 
It is of interest to note that the work begins in a 
systematic way in the seventh grade. (We shall later 
show the reasons for an earlier start.) It seems partic- 
ularly appropriate that the eighth grade child should 
study the value of further education, for this will en- 
courage him to continue study even if he cannot attend 
the high school. 
The Grand Rapids plan is very thorough in English, 
and since the publication of the book there has been some 
extensive development in the vocational use of the other 
studies. 
The ideals back of the activities so far carried on 
seem sound, and the aims high. No narrow conformity _ 
1 The following statement of general aims or topics for each grade is 
of interest : 
Seventh Grade: Vocational ambition. 
Eighth Grade: The value of education. 
Ninth Grade: The elements of character that make for success. 
Tenth Grade: The world’s work — a call to service. 
Eleventh Grade: Choosing a vocation. 
Twelfth Grade: Preparation for one’s life work. 
This list does not mean that the child is asked to make the decisions 
indicated at exactly the time each topic is being studied. It means 
simply that a concentrated attémpt is made to set the child thinking 
about each of these problems. The choice of a vocation may not come 
in the eleventh grade; it may come in the eighth or the thirteenth. But 
during the eleventh grade the boy or girl has an opportunity to survey 
and check up the factors which should enter into that choice.
-P-A-G-E-49

to present social and business conditions is involved. 
Witness Davis’ statement on needed legislation on page 
162. There has been organized in Grand Rapids, under 
the auspices of the Association of Commerce of that 
city, a Junior Association of Commerce which gives the 
boys of the high school an opportunity to come into con- 
tact with the commerce and industry of the city, and with 
the men engaged in these occupations. 
The chief lessons of procedure from the Grand Rapids 
experiment are the following: use the studies of the 
school program to aid the child in understanding the 
vocational world and in making his choices and adjust- 
ments, lay broad foundations for the vocational bureau, 
and secure the codperation of the moral and vocational 
interests of the community — library, school, occupa- 
tion, and commercial associations. 
The Grand Rapids plan, like that of Boston, seems still 
to be in process of growth. It becomes more and more 
apparent that vocational guidance can become a satis- 
factory system of procedure in a city only after it has 
been developed out of the knowledge, experiences, and 
interests of the individual teachers. Up to the present 
time no large city has succeeded in spreading the interest 
widely enough and in securing adequate funds to bring 
about what could be called a complete, city-wide plan 
of vocational guidance. For that, teachers must be 
instructed and encouraged, and they must be given time 
in the daily program for the work. Boston and Grand 
Rapids have gone farther than any other cities. Yet the
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
latter, like the former, seems to be but little beyond the 
voluntary and permissive stage. Codperative effort 
has led to good results so far; it would seem proper to 
take a new step in the near future, to work out a plan 
which will give every child adequate guidance, and to 
finance and closely supervise the operation of the scheme. 
The Mishawaka Plan. One of the most interesting 
and well-rounded methods of guidance so far described in 
print is that used for three years at Mishawaka, Ind., 
and explained in the School Review of April, 1915.1 
In working out the plan the teachers of the high school 
first made a survey in the light of which the high school 
courses were improved. Reading lists, assembly talks, 
conferences with seniors and eighth grade pupils, a 
course on vocations, and provision for placement, are 
used in the scheme. Entering students are well cared for, 
frequent enrollment blanks give vocational clews, and a 
system of follow-up work gives valuable information. 
The chief virtue of this plan is that it shows how 
any school (or, in fact, any teacher) may make a safe and 
effective beginning in vocational guidance. 
New York City. — The High School Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation of New York City has interested itself in voca- 
tional guidance since 1908. Investigations, conferences 
with graduating pupils, pamphlets, and provision for 
placement have been the chief kinds of work. So far, 
however, there has been no central bureau; most of the 
work has been carried forward by voluntary committees 
1 See Horton.
-P-A-G-E-51
  BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 41 
and at the individual schools. The Central Committee 
on Vocational Guidance published a booklet in 1912, 
and in the same year held, under its auspices, the Second 
National Conference on Vocational Guidance. Although 
a few individuals in New York City have devoted much 
time and energy to vocational guidance, it cannot be 
said that there is any plan for the city. 
In the Sixteenth Annual Report of the Superintendent 
of Schools of New York City, 1915, five pages are devoted 
to this subject, and the superintendent recommends a 
plan for the city resembling that for Edinburgh described 
in Bloomfield’s The School and the Start in Life. 
During the winter of 1914-1915 Bloomfield was called 
to New York for part-time investigations, in connection 
with the Mayor’s Committee on Vocational Help to 
Minors. This committee investigated the school history 
of boys and girls at work, the social environment of the 
children, the parent’s estimate of the child’s problems 
and progress, the employer’s viewpoint about the chil- 
dren, and the opinions of the children themselves. The 
investigation was extensive, and at the same time was 
conducted with care, in order to keep close to actual 
individual cases. There were conferences in which boys 
and girls answered questions directly to the committee. 
The results of the investigation have not yet been pub- 
lished. On the basis of the investigations made, the 
committee has drawn up a comprehensive plan for voca- 
tional guidance in three schools in Manhattan, and the 
Board of Superintendents has approved the project.

Somerville. — Twenty teachers in Somerville, Mass., 
made preliminary investigations for the establishment 
of a plan for vocational guidance. It has been found 
that even those students who are pursuing relatively 
narrow vocational courses in the high school, such as the 
commercial courses, are not at all sure of their choice of 
careers, and it is suspected that only a small number of 
graduates are following the work for which they were 
ostensibly prepared in school. The committee has 
investigated dropping out, has utilized the school’s plan 
whereby each pupil in high school selects a teacher as 
an adviser, and has proposed a plan for systematic 
vocational guidance.! 
Beginnings in Chicago.—In 1912 a committee on 
vocational training, of the Chicago City Club, reported 
the need of vocational guidance. As early as 1910 
some work in guidance had been begun by the Chicago 
School of Civics and Philanthropy, and school people 
became interested. In 1913 the Board of Education 
gave office space to the work, and all children applying 
for employment certificates were directed to consult this 
bureau. Thus the effort has been from the first to aid 
those coming up for placement or for certificates to begin 
work. At the same time, however, a great deal of good 
has been done in returning children to school. Industries 
in Chicago are investigated, bulletins published, place- 
ment is put on a high plane, and children are followed in 
their occupations.

BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 43 
In a recent survey of the Chicago schools made by 
the Chicago teachers, two committees took up the ques- 
tion of vocational guidance. Both recommended a 
central office, and one drew up a comprehensive plan for 
the work. Early in 1916 the Board of Education decided 
to take full responsibility for the central bureau, and 
progress may be expected.! 
Work in Other Cities. — Buffalo and Los Angeles, 
through the school authorities or through committees of 
teachers, have issued lists of occupations open to young 
people. In one of the Los Angeles high schools voca- 
tional conferences were arranged by teachers in the 
English department, but no serious attempt was made to 
prepare these teachers for the work of counseling. Some 
investigation has been made in both cities, and in Los 
Angeles a useful bulletin was issued to post in the 
schools, showing what kinds of courses are given in 
each of the high schools, and to what occupations these 
courses lead. 
Rochester has collected information about working 
girls, and used it to improve the school program of 
studies.? Bulletins on occupations have been issued. 
De Kalb, IIL, has instituted a very suggestive system of 
guidance.? Newton, Mass., has organized a plan con- 
nected with the work-certificate office. Cincinnati,

-P-A-G-E-54
  44 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Boston are carrying 
on guidance in connection with continuation schools. 
The Los Angeles, Berkeley, and Rochester intermediate 
schools, and the Gary plan, at Gary, Troy, and New 
York City, provide differentiated courses in which chil- 
dren can discover their talents and aptitudes. Oakland, 
San José, and hundreds of other cities, are doing active 
guidance work in the high schools. Both the Oakland 
Technical High School and the San José High School 
have done pioneer work in organizing life-career classes, 
—school groups for the study of the occupations. 
The life-career or occupations class seems to have been 
originated by Mr. Wheatley, almost as soon as Parsons 
began his work.? 
Long Beach, Cal., High School offers credit for the 
continued study of one’s vocational problems. A variety 
of exercises is included in the study. 
The January, 1916, bulletin of the National Vocational 
Guidance Association prints a list of over 150 high schools 
which claim to have made beginnings. 
Guidance in Colleges. — No systematic canvass of the 
guidance work of the colleges seems to have been pub- 
lished. The following notes will serve to indicate some 
of the work undertaken. 
Wisconsin University holds annual conferences of 
women students, and the dean of women holds daily office 
hours for counsel. The character of the work is reported   
      
1 See Jacobs. 
2 See Wheatley, and Gowin and Wheatley, bibliography.
-P-A-G-E-55
  
BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 45 
in the Vocational-Guidance Bulletin, of November, 1915. 
In the same bulletin is a short report of the guidance 
at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. There is provision 
in the institute for men to discover that they are not 
fitted to be engineers, without the traditional humiliation 
of failure in studies. 
Vocational conferences for women students of the 
State College of Washington are discussed in the Decem- 
ber, 1915, Vocational-Guidance Bulletin. Special stress 
is given to occupations other than teaching. The 
Women’s Educational and Industrial Union of Boston, 
through its appointment bureau, has held conferences 
with women students of several colleges. The University 
of Minnesota has a faculty committee on vocational 
guidance for women, and for the year 1917-1918 a 
vocational adviser for women has been appointed. 
One of the most systematic efforts to give educational 
guidance in a higher institution is that undertaken at 
Reed College in the freshman course called College 
Life. Among the topics included in this course are the 
following: the purpose of the college; selection of 
courses ; principles and methods of study ; the use of the 
library; student honesty; general reading and mental 
recreation; health; athletics; the relation of the college 
to the community; the choice of a vocation. Various 
members of the faculty contribute to the course. 
College Courses in Vocational Guidance. — A recent 
article! on college departments of education names the

46 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
following colleges as conducting courses on vocational 
guidance: Chicago, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Washington, 
and Teachers College of Columbia University. To 
these must be added courses in Boston University, the 
University of California and Harvard University, besides 
summer-school courses in several other colleges. Los 
Angeles State Normal School is conducting a course for 
teachers in service. Without doubt many other colleges 
are giving full courses, and certainly all departments of 
education have courses in which the subject forms at 
least a part of the work. 
Courses for Employment Managers. — During the 
past two years the Tuck School of Administration and 
Finance, the business division of Dartmouth College, 
has given a course to train men for the duties of the 
employment manager. The Wharton School of Finance 
of the University of Pennsylvania has organized similar 
work. 
Guidance through Other Agencies. — What resources 
are there for vocational advice, for a person who is not 
a student at a school or college? The Vocation Bureau 
of Boston has had to face this question in answering 
letters from all parts of the country. In most cases 
there is no satisfactory solution; in few cities are there 
agencies whose business it is to give the misemployed 
worker the systematic counsel required to help him. 
Guidance by Religious Organizations. — The Young 
Men’s and Young Women’s Christian Associations have 
general, educational, or employment secretaries who can
-P-A-G-E-57
  BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 47 
give counsel to their members, and these officers fre- 
quently accommodate nonmembers too. But it is not 
an easy thing for a person unfamiliar with the organiza- 
tion to bring himself to approach these busy officials. 
Besides, it is doubtful if they can aid a stranger greatly 
in one or two conferences. For their own members, 
however, these associations do good work in vocational 
guidance, in spite of the occasional tendency to over- 
emphasize character analysis! The Boston, Buffalo, 
and New York associations have given counsel to 
thousands of young men. 
Pastors of churches, writers, lecturers, teachers, 
and superintendents of schools are often appealed to by 
strangers needing vocational help. 
Guidance through Governmental Projects. —A 
searching investigation into the many activities of the 
departments of the national government would disclose 
a large amount of vocational guidance. Much of it is 
impersonal, in the way of bulletins, agricultural reports, 
civil service manuals, and other documents: these are 
studied by many persons needing vocational advice. 
One of the most interesting experiments in guidance 
was the summer camp organized in 1915 by the Rec- 
reation League of San Francisco, and conducted by 
Forestry-Service officials of the national government. 
Twenty boys were given three weeks of strenuous life 
in the woods, and under the direction of experienced 
rangers had actual practice in the duties of a forester, 
1 See Davis’ Vocational and Moral Guidance, pp. 262-272.
-P-A-G-E-58
48 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
from cooking and heliographing to putting out a fire a 
mile in length. 
The work done by the Canadian and Australian govern- 
ments, in financing men who wish to become farmers, is 
a practical kind of vocational guidance. The Home- 
stead Commission of Massachusetts has repeatedly asked 
the legislature for funds to begin similar work, and a 
beginning is about to be made. 
Work by Clubs, Settlements, and Libraries. — The 
need for vocational counsel is appreciated by every 
settlement worker, and guidance is a more or less im- 
portant part of the program of every such institution. 
The Henry Street Settlement of New York City, through 
_its Vocational Scholarship Committee, gives girls who 
would otherwise go into unskilled trades two extra 
years of schooling, and thus helps them to obtain skilled 
work.! 
Public libraries were among the first institutions to 
understand the need for vocational guidance, and the 
lists of books, issued by the Brooklyn and Grand Rapids 
libraries, have been of great use to teachers and coun- 
selors. Miss Hall’s paper, reproduced in Davis’ 
Vocational and Morai Guidance, gives a general state- 
ment of what has been and may be done.” 
Guidance through Placement. Placement in School 
Departments. — In a later chaptcr we shall discuss the 
advantages and disadvantages of guidance through 
1 See Readings, p. 322; also Nat. Voc. Guidance Assn., 1914, pp. 59-61. 
2 See also Bloomfield, Youth, etc., p. 7.
-P-A-G-E-59
          BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 49 
placement (Chapter IV). We shall here note typical 
organizations for such work. We have already spoken 
of the Placement Bureau of Boston, which is now 
connected with the school system. Rochester, N.Y., 
and Lincoln, Neb.,! have placement bureaus which have 
induced certain employers to obtain all their help under 
eighteen years of age through the bureaus. 
Portland, Ore., maintained a summer-employment 
office, under the supervision of the school board. High 
schools in many cities aid in placing their students. 
Business Organizations. — Commercial associations 
have frequently used the term vocational guidance to 
apply to plans for placement organized under their 
auspices. Doubtless some guidance is given in con- 
nection with the placement. The subcommittee on 
industrial education and vocational guidance of the 
Chicago Association of Commerce has maintained a 
placement service since 1913. This subcommittee 
coéperates with the schools, aids in the effort to hold 
the child in school as long as possible, consults with 
parents, studies the aptitudes of the child, places him 
advantageously, and maintains a “ follow-up ” service. 
Other Appointment Agencies. — Among other place- 
ment organizations which interest themselves in voca- 
tional guidance are the numerous associations for aiding 
college women to obtain employment. The Inter- 
collegiate Bureau of Occupations, New York City, is 
the best known example. Other such agencies exist in 
1See Leavitt, Dec., ro15.
-P-A-G-E-60
   
      5° THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Los Angeles. 
Much helpful guidance is furnished by these bureaus. 
The Women’s Educational and Industrial Union, of 
Boston, maintains an appointment bureau which gives 
vocational advice, and conducts short-term classes in 
certain occupations. A course in photography was 
recently given. A library on vocations for women is 
maintained. The Union has for the past two years con- 
ducted a class in vocational guidance. 
Most colleges maintain appointment offices, and some 
of these have developed great efficiency. Their particular 
concern is to help graduates obtain teaching positions, 
but their work is by no means confined to this occupation. 
Vocational Guidance in Foreign School Systems. — 
The European experiments in vocational guidance have 
been discussed at length by Bloomfield in The School 
and the Start in Life. Some of the salient characteristics 
from which American cities may learn, are these: the 
publication of brief, helpful books for youth and parents, 
giving vocational information about each of many occu- 
pations; progress in health guidance, particularly in 
preventing injurious labor on the part of young people; 
the organization of large voluntary committees for 
guidance of working children and youth. The needs 
growing out of the war have led to many new adaptations 
of the work of guidance in foreign countries. 
Summary. — The plans discussed in this chapter will 
indicate the nature of the work so far attempted; they 
cannot indicate its geographical extent. Our survey    
-P-A-G-E-61
          BEGINNINGS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 5r 
shows that there has been an effective start in many 
schools in various parts of the country; that many of 
these efforts have been preceded by a study of the occu- 
pational opportunities; that in each of a few cities there 
is a central vocational bureau ;..that.the colleges are 
interesting themselves in the movement; that. religious 
associations, governmental offices, clubs, settlements, 
and libraries have aided in the work of guidance; and 
that there are many appointment agencies which make 
an effort to give vocational guidance in connection with 
placement. We know, too, that at the present moment 
many American cities are laying plans for inaugurating 
systematic vocational guidance. 
The chief defects in the efforts for vocational guidance 
so far made are of two classes, and grow out of two causes. 
In the first group are those plans which are inadequate 
mainly on account of the fact that they have not yet 
reached maturity. In most of their characteristics these 
are commendable so far as they go, and their present rate 
of growth is healthy and hopeful. In the second group 
are those plans which have set up the placement activity, 
or have failed to put the guidance work where it obviously 
belongs, —in the school department. In most cases, 
apparently, satisfactory development can hardly be 
expected without a reorganization of those plans. 
It is characteristic of the men and women in charge 
of the work in the first group, so far as we have been able 
to observe, that they recognize the limitations of their 
work, and are endeavoring to extend it as an educational
-P-A-G-E-62
    
    
               52 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
activity. Those engaged in the work of the other plans, 
however, are more apt to look for immediate ends, and to 
fail to grasp the real need for offering vocational informa- 
tion and guidance long before the child is ready to leave 
school. 
We shall now turn to the methods used in guidance. 
In the next chapter we shall consider the method of giving 
vocational guidance through educational guidance; in 
the fourth chapter we shall attempt to evaluate some 
other methods of counsel.    
-P-A-G-E-63
CHAPTER III 
VocATIONAL GUIDANCE THROUGH EDUCATIONAL 
GUIDANCE 
Twat educational guidance is of prime importance is 
shown in the history of an actual case. The person 
concerned was the son of a mechanic with a large family, 
and early found it necessary to aid in increasing the 
family income. Two summers and one or two holiday 
seasons he served as cash boy in a department store. 
After school and Saturdays, during much of the time he 
was in elementary and high school, he worked as helper 
in his father’s carpenter shop, and as helper and clerk 
in a paint store. A year out of his college course was 
spent in a grocery store. During all of this time he 
received absolutely no counsel of a definite or conscious 
kind about the work he was doing, save the instructions 
of the persons for whom he worked. Nor did he make 
any choice of vocation in this period. On the other 
hand, however, he did have educational guidance, from 
sister and teachers, as a result of which he was influenced 
to make the effort to begin and to complete his college 
education. In the course of time he became a teacher. 
It is apparent that narrow vocational guidance with- 
out any eduéational viewpoint might have been a stum- 
53  
-P-A-G-E-64
  54 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
bling-block in this boy’s way. In Chapter V we shall 
discuss the danger in the immediate kind of counsel 
which attempts to sort out children twelve years old into 
“ thing-thinkers ” and “ idea-thinkers,”’ and thereupon 
to narrow their educational opportunity. In the present 
chapter we shall inquire how the school can widen the 
vocational horizon of the pupil, aid him to make an in- 
telligent choice, and advise him concerning his ‘prepara- 
tion. It will be evident, as we proceed, that a wide 
outlook and a fixed desire for education will often rele- 
gate present jobs to their proper place, as temporary 
and never more than experimental. 
We are to deal in this chapter with methods of voca- 
tional guidance as exemplified in educational guidance. 
We shall be concerned with the following main topics: 
(t) The child’s place in the school; (2) School organi- 
zation as related to guidance; (3) Possibilities for 
guidance in the school program; (4) Possibilities for 
guidance in the association of students with each other ; 
(5) The prevocational and continuation schools as in- 
struments of self-discovery; (6) Definite preparation 
for the occupation; (7) The development of good 
traits of character. 
The Child’s Place in the School. — Why does the child 
go to school? Let us attempt to answer this question, 
in the light of vocational guidance, first prefacing our 
study with a reference to the early play of children. 
Breadth of Experience through Earliest Play. — The 
purpose of play in the child’s life seems to be to enable
-P-A-G-E-65
EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 55 
him to understand his world and to develop qualities 
that shall enable him to take his place in that world; 
it provides a tool through which he experiments and dis- 
covers the existence and methods of operation of mate- 
rials, forces, and mental qualities. Apparently there 
can be no superstructure of educational guidance with- 
out the foundation laid by the child in his play. 
Perhaps the chief way the young child begins to ac- 
quaint himself with the world is through dramatiza- 
tion. Joseph Lee has the dramatic age beginning at 
three, and among the first dramatizations of children 
are those which concern occupations. Let the postman 
or a plumber call, and the moment he goes the play 
begins. By entering into the fun — Mr. Lee shows that 
it is the child’s most serious business — the parent can 
signally augment the educational effect. The trac- 
table adult will find that the dramatization has elabo- 
rate and exact details, and will observe a growing sense 
of satisfaction and consciousness of success on the part 
of the child. 
1 The vocational counselor must remember that this play is not for 
finding clews which point toward the occupation. Lee sets fourteen 
years as the earliest age at which vocational clews manifest themselves 
and states that in many cases none present themselves until much later. 
He says: 
“And the first form of an instinct may be very different from that 
which it is destined finally to assume — a fact not yet recognized, even 
in this day of the apotheosis of evolution, by those educators, who, in 
their zeal for what they deem the practical, insist on pinning the fruit 
to the first sprout that appears above the ground. . . . Indeed there 
is almost a presumption that the spiritual force developing in any given 
play will not, in adult life, appear in anything resembling its present   
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
The working out of these dramatic situations in his 
play at home and the assumption of various personalities, 
give the child an important preliminary experience, 
which becomes the mental equipment with which he 
later enters the school. Without doubt the complicated 
world of occupations discussed in his readers and his 
geographies will be better understood on account of 
the lessons learned in early play. Since an intelligent 
choice of vocation demands a broad vision of, the field 
of occupations, the importance of this early dramatiza- 
tion is at once evident. 
Aside from this form of growth through dramatiza- 
tion, the child’s play before the school age should give 
him social contact and power of getting on with other 
children, and the habit of self-dependence and success 
in carrying out his legitimate purposes. 
If play can be made to teach these lessons, the founda- 
tions for educational and vocational guidance will be 
well laid by the time the child reaches the school age. 
How Schools Guide the Child. — Let us now turn to 
the school age, and consider first this question: How 
should the schools be organized and managed, for effec- 
tive vocational guidance? 
Educational institutions are organized to continue 
the lessons gained through systematic, serious play — 
to provide experiences useful to the individual and to 
form. If it looks like a rose now it may develop into something very 
beautiful, but the chances are that it will not be a rose.” (Lee, Play 
in Education, pp. 63-64.)
-P-A-G-E-67
  EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 57 
society. It is the business of the teacher to furnish an 
environment in which the pupils solve problems. The 
good school furnishes a sampling of life’s worth-while 
experiences. This requires both manual and mental 
exercises —a combination of study and work — and 
the free play of the child’s instincts. As Johnson per- 
tinently says in reference to the serious purposes of the 
school, as related to the child’s interest in play : 
’ The efficient method is and must always be, in the nature 
of the case, from interests, activities, and achievements, 
to subject matter and not the reverse. The problem of 
elementary education is not to put play into the curriculum, 
but rather to put the curriculum into play.! 
Let us see how the methods of teaching, the plans 
of organization, and school studies can be made to 
serve these principles, and how the vocational interests 
of the child may be given appropriate consideration and 
development. 
Methods of Teaching should early be related to Voca- 
tions.— The principle of beginning with the child is 
making headway in the organization of many schools. 
The designation of certain types of schools as “ life- 
saving stations” and of others as “self-discovery 
schools ” shows the attention being paid to the child by 
the modern teacher. Dewey’s Schools of To-morrow, 
and Burk’s In Re Everychild vs. Lockstep Schooling 
show the progressive teacher how the work of moving 
the focus of attention may be carried on. True educa-

tional guidance is impossible to the teacher who sees 
the subject before he sees the child. 
The child and his needs must be the teacher’s point 
of view, and vocational needs are not to be lost sight of. 
Beginning with the fifth grade, at the very least, the 
child should occasionally be regarded as one who will 
ultimately have an occupation in life, and as one who 
will sooner or later have to make his choice. We may 
well be generous in the breadth of experience in play 
and work in the kindergarten and the early grades in 
consonance with the thought that vocational outlook 
(as well as many other good things) comes from such 
experience. Nor need we narrow the scope of experience 
in holding that definite preparation for choice of occupa- 
tion should find a place in the school plan from the fifth 
year on. Indeed as Eliot maintains,’ habits of listless- 
ness toward studies, and laziness, too, may arise from 
failure to appeal to the “ life-career motive.” 
School Organization as Related to Guidance. — The 
development of men and women is the purpose of the 
school, and the selection of and preparation for the 
occupation is one of the important features in this devel- 
opment. The schools must therefore be organized with 
the vocational guidance of the child as one of the aims 
in mind. 
Elementary-School Organization for Educational Guid- 
ance. — What organization shall school board, super-

the elementary school, if that school is to carry out its 
vocational-guidance purpose? In Chapter II, Stan- 
dards in Education, of Hanus’s School Efficiency, the 
whole question of aims and elements of organization is 
tersely discussed. Unity of aim has more place in these 
lower grades, though there must be provision for flexi- 
bility in the rate of promotions, and for special classes 
and special schools whenever needed. 
The work of the first six grades may comprise reading, 
writing, effective speaking, sizaple computation, con- 
struction of simple articles out of paper, wood, and clay, 
the domestic arts, singing, drawing, games, dramatics, 
and stories of history.!. Geography, chiefly concerned 
with occupational opportunities, may begin with the 
fourth grade. All of the work of the first six grades 
may be called vocational in that both the so-called 
tools of knowledge, and the breadth of experience de- 
rived from the other studies are essential to success 
in the occupation. 
Differentiation in the Intermediate Age. — Beginning 
with the sixth or seventh grade there must be provision 
for differentiation. Many American cities have made 
significant strides in the improvement of the upper 
elementary grades. Los Angeles has eleven interme- 
diate or junior high schools which take children upon the 
completion of the sixth grade, offer them the choice of

Plays and Games, and Dopp, The Place of Industries in Elementary Edu- 
cation.

  60 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
many studies and provide secondary school methods, 
special teachers, and several studies formerly taught 
only in the high school. Boston has provided “ pre- 
vocational centers,” to which are admitted those boys 
and girls who might drop out if forced through the 
regulation routine. Many cities have experimented 
with the “ transfer class,” an attempt to help pupils 
who have reached the high school age but have failed 
to complete the elementary school. And many cities 
have seized the opportunity for schooling adapted to 
the blind, the dumb, the backward. Several progres- 
sive school systems in the country have been influenced 
by these recent changes.! 
Besides the improvement of the upper grades, the 
organization of continuation schools gives promise of 
our realizing the ideal that before long our young people 
will never entirely ‘‘ quit school.” The prevocational 
centers and the continuation schools are of such direct 
importance for vocational guidance that we shall refer 
to them later in the chapter, after we have discussed 
the subjects of the school program. 
High School Organization for Educational Guidance. 
— As in the case of the elementary school, a recognition 
of the problems of individual differences is prerequisite 
to that organization of the high school most favorable 
to vocational guidance. The aims and methods of the 
high school need not differ from those of the elementary 
1See Briggs, Wright, and Com. of Educ., 1914, pp. 11-12, 21, 25, 93- 
96, 258.
-P-A-G-E-71
        EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 61 
school, except in so far as to provide for the fact that 
individual pupils differ more widely in their interests 
as we go upward in the school — the effect of learning 
(or increased practice) on the “curve of learning” 
is to widen the curve. Hence we need opportunity for 
greater differentiation. 
For the purposes of vocational guidance the character 
of the differentiation should depend on the aims, interests, 
and future opportunities of the students. It is impor- 
tant to know both the pupils and their environment 
before organizing the school or drawing up the program 
of studies. It is idle to say, as some superintendents 
may, that each high school principal should per- 
sonally do this work — should study individuals and 
environment for the purpose of giving the pupils educa- 
tional and vocational guidance. The principal is ordi- 
narily too much occupied with teaching or with the 
routine duties of his office either to get intimately ac- 
quainted with the pupils or to spend time enough in field 
observations and investigations to give him the needed 
outlook toward the occupational opportunities of those 
who are to leave the school. 
What then can the organization provide? It should 
provide what the Boston, Grand Rapids, San José, 
Mishawaka, and many other high schools provide: 
one or more teachers whose chief business in the school 
is to make himself of special use in investigations of this 
sort. Such a person should be one who can leave the 
school for an hour’s visit to a factory, store, or office
-P-A-G-E-72
     62 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
when necessary, study the points of view of persons of 
various occupations and various life philosophies, sum- 
marize significant vocational information in such a 
way as to make it available for busy teachers, be at the 
call of any teacher to help solve a difficult vocational 
problem, give time to consultations with parents, give 
helpful talks about typical occupations, and conduct 
classes in the study of opportunities. Ordinarily, there 
will be at least a man and a woman teacher in each high 
school for such work. While such a division of labor 
is undoubtedly advisable, yet if the whole school program 
is to be related to the vocations, and if we are still to 
adhere to the policy of coeducation, every teacher must 
be prepared to do his or her best in capitalizing, for the 
benefit of the students of both sexes, the vocational 
values in every study. ‘ 
Flexibility in Organization Necessary for Guidance. — 
Perhaps no element of successful organization is of such 
importance as that of flexibility. If failure begets 
failure, and if the habit of success is of vital importance 
for the pupil, then it is the business of the school to see 
that circumstances make possible the hourly, daily, 
and ultimate success of every pupil. The task should 
always be within the grasp of the boy or girl. Principals 
and teachers must be willing to modify the course of 
study rather than spoil the boy.! 
1In a Los Angeles intermediate school, a boy gave difficulty to the 
teacher and to the class in a recitation which began shortly after 11 o’clock 
each day. It was found that this was his fourth academic recitation 
each morning, that he gave no trouble in earlier classes, that he was     
  
-P-A-G-E-73
      EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 63 
Boys are sometimes advised to interrupt their schooi- 
ing for a year’s working experience. This advice is 
mentioned by Davis, on page 87 of Vocational and 
Moral Guidance. Would it not be better, however, 
to increase the choice of subjects and the kind of activi- 
ties so that the boy will not be exposed to the tempta- 
tion which comes with earning money — wanting to 
keep on working? It is the experience of boys’-club 
workers, and of observant teachers, that many boys 
“learn the value of money ” (a little money) too early 
in their careers — so early that it cuts short their school- 
ing. 
We shall find in a later chapter that the rigid school 
program drives boys and girls from school and into the 
great army of unskilled workers. A program adapted 
to their needs might save them for more education and 
more intelligent choice of vocation. 
School Organization should not Relieve the Child of 
Responsibility. — The danger latent in the whole tend- 
ency to adapt the school organization and program to 
the child is that we may make conditions so easy for 
him that he will become a creature of whims, drifting, 
and dependence. Prudence and good judgment, there- 
fore, are necessary in the administration of the elective 
system and the provisions for flexibility. These 
devices should never be used by a boy or girl to evade 
fond of athletics but was assigned to the gymnasium class only twice 
a week. Here was obviously an opportunity to change custom. In 
spite of administrative difficulties the boy’s program should have been 
altered, and daily physical training given him.   
-P-A-G-E-74
   
  64 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
an obvious duty, to avoid the necessary consequences 
of a careless choice, or to withdraw from a half-completed 
undertaking. 
On the positive side, what can the organization do 
to foster character development? It can provide for 
breadth of experience through many different kinds of 
tasks, and it can require success in these tasks as a con- 
dition to participation in the more advanced and at- 
tractive activities of the school. Further, it can seek 
out the aims and ambitions of the boy or girl in his own 
field of interest and show him what an amount of effort 
and persistence is necessary to success. Thus, the boy 
who wishes to learn to play the bass drum may be given 
lessons and allowed to try with the school orchestra, 
where he will readily see the need for application, atten- 
tion, and study. Teaching him to do the broad jump 
correctly, using the proper marks to get his step, will 
mean months of study and practice for him. The girl 
who wishes to “ go on the stage” may be assigned a 
part in a school play where she may be shown the neces- 
sity for a long course of training as a prerequisite to 
success. 
The habit of hard, willing work in “ play ” can cer- 
tainly teach good lessons needed in the occupation, 
and these lessons can be transferred to the schoolroom 
and to after life, if the teachers will make a serious 
attempt to see that the transfer is made possible. Later 
we shall show how some organizations have used student 
or club activities for this purpose.

How Certain New Plans of Organization Stimulate 
and Aid Vocational Guidance. — New plans of organ- 
ization inevitably stimulate guidance, for they involve 
a reéxamination of the aims and methods of the school. 
The Gary plan widens the experience and opportunity 
of the child, and so aids in the discovery of his interests 
and talents! Further, the practical nature of the shop 
work gives excellent preliminary knowledge in several 
trades.2_ The flexible daily program gives opportunity 
for outside experiences which widen the vocational 
horizon. 
The longer school day is another plan which is favor- 
able to better guidance, for it involves more play and 
more manual work. 
The supervision of the child’s experiences in the winter 
and summer vacations is a fruitful method of guiding 
him. This plan is used in many school departments, 
among them Portland, Oregon, and the High School 
of Commerce, Boston. Dartmouth College has recently 
inaugurated such a scheme. 
Summary. — Our survey of school organization leads 
us to conclude that much of the recent progress has 
been directly in line with educational and vocational 
guidance, in that teachers are led to turn their attention 
to the welfare of the individual, provision for differentia- 
tion is made, and certain newer plans are opening the 
1It has been suggested by Dewey that the enriched opportunity in 
the Gary plan will make actual guidance unnecessary. This question 
we shall discuss in the next chapter.

    66 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
way to more efficient guidance. We shall now turn to 
the consideration of the studies of the school program, 
as instruments for educational and vocational guidance. 
Possibilities for Guidance in the School Program.! — 
One of the writers on vocational guidance maintains 
that the subjects of the school program which have no 
occupational value are of little use. We need not agree 
with him, but we must hold, if the child is to be regarded 
by the teacher as a prospective worker, that each lesson 
having something to contribute to the vocational effi- 
ciency of the child should be taught with that fact in 
mind. The vocational uses will appear in almost all 
of the studies and will predominate in many of them. 
English used for Guidance. — No doubt many teachers 
would object to displacing the present list of literary 
masterpieces which form the basis of the course in 
English. But these books themselves have vocational 
implications. Witness the lessons in qualities necessary 
to success in such works? as Captains Courageous, 
Paul Revere’s Ride, Treasure Island, Horatius, The 
Last of the Mohicans, Tom Brown’s School Days, Old 
Testament Stories, Bacon’s Essays, Emerson’s Essays, 
and A Tale of Two Cities. Witness, too, the actual voca- 
tional information and lessons in vocational guidance 
in Silas Marner, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, Snow- 
1 For references on the vocational aspects of the school program, see 
the following: Bonser, Fletcher, Giles, Richards, Leavitt, Wheatley, 
Wile.

bound, Franklin’s Autobiography, and Parton’s Captains 
of Industry. The vocational questions arising in such 
books would serve as bases for interesting discussions 
which would put more life into a study which now often 
contributes notably to the process of eliminating children 
from school. 
Some schools require book reviews of pupils in con- 
nection with the English work, and the available list 
is composed almost exclusively of fiction. It would 
at once add to the interest and breadth of the English 
work if books on vocational subjects were added to this 
list.t 
The elimination of such material as useless formal 
grammar and long spelling lists would give room for 
more practical work in the language and literature 
classes. 
Written Composition. — The work at Grand Rapids 
has been noted; it stands as an example of effective 
use of composition. Contribution No. I in Davis’ 
book, which concerns work in the seventh and eighth 
grades, offers several interesting samples of pupils’ 
work. 
Undeveloped Possibilities in Oral English. — One of 
the Grand Rapids teachers? raises objections to the use 
of long biographical books, and gives her experiences 
in classes formed into clubs and arranging their own 
programs. The classes have made a specialty of “ local 
1See Davis’s Vocational and Moral Guidance for lists of such books.

heroes,” interviewing persons in their own city, and 
reporting the results orally to the class. 
Moreover, there may be a danger involved in attach- 
ing vocational guidance unthinkingly to the written 
composition lesson. Some teachers of composition con- 
cern themselves chiefly with the mechanics of writing, 
with the twofold result that subject matter is subor- 
dinated, and students dislike the work. It would be 
a pity for such a teacher to add vocational themes to 
the slaughter. Red ink, liberally applied, will kill 
even a subject as interesting as the choice of a 
vocation. 
Why should we not approach vocational interests 
through Oral English, and wait until the students them- 
selves express the desire to put ideas into written form? 
All the topics listed in the Grand Rapids suggestions are 
appropriate for oral work. Spoken English offers rich 
opportunity for experimentation and _ self-discovery. 
If the pupil is allowed to select his own subjects, he will 
be found explaining scientific and mechanical processes, 
telling about inventions, discussing current events, and 
arguing about vocations. He can be induced to learn 
to draw as he speaks, to give simple business talks with 
demonstrations, to take part in debates, and to organize 
impromptu conversations, interviews, and plays, in which 
problems like those in real life are presented and solved. 
In all this work he will make two gains: he will grow 
in confidence and speaking ability ; and he will discover 
his interests. If something closer still to the vocation
-P-A-G-E-79
          EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 69 
is desired, interviews may be arranged in which one 
pupil applies for work or promotion,! and afterward the 
class may discuss and criticize. Nomination speeches, 
announcements, the oral advertisement, technical de- 
scriptions, the introduction of a speaker, and mock 
trials offer valuable educational guidance. 
Parliamentary law is of special importance. It trains 
the same person to lead and to follow. It is used in all 
organizations, whether business or social, into which the 
children will enter. 
Oral English is used in connection with every vocation ; 
hence its importance. 
Arithmetic. — Such subjects as partial payments and 
cube root are going out of the arithmetics because they 
have little vocational use.” It is being recognized that 
spelling, writing, and arithmetic are for practical every- 
day needs, and that time spent in trying to find un- 
related “culture” in them is waste time. It is the 
business of the teacher to relate the arithmetic as closely 
as possible to the obvious vocational needs of the boy and 
girl. The schoolroom, yard, store, and home offer wide 
opportunity for problems in arithmetic. In the upper 
grades it may be wise to offer sample problems from 
each of several common occupations. It may also be 
advisable to give the boys some arithmetic which will

a plot in connection with the application, thus making the interview into 
an extempore play.

not interest the girls, and the girls some problems 
connected with homemaking. 
Geography. — Geography has manifold possibilities. 
Related to human life, it can serve to introduce dis- 
cussions on such topics as the following: Why do people 
live here? What do they do for a living? What has 
the topography to do with the habits and occupations 
of the people?? What are the resources of this place 
or that? How can we account for commercial and 
industrial differences between two places? Geography 
may be related to arithmetic by the use of time tables 
and graphs. Stereoscopic pictures, moving pictures, 
visits to museums, travel, and reference books all may 
be used in connection with the geography lesson. 
Commercial geography is a profitable high school sub- 
ject of great vocational value. Another name sometimes 
used is Industrial Geography, and the phrase Occupa- 
tional Geography is coming into use, though textbooks 
have not thus far covered that field. 
Social Studies: History, Economics, Civics, Sociology. 
— Fortunately, history is becoming less a fixed body of 
knowledge, and more a thing to be studied in the light 
of present events. Textbooks are emphasizing the 
beginnings of industries, changes caused by inventions,? 
the facilities for transportation, the educational re-

sources of the people, the manners, customs, and occupa- 
tions. This gives the teacher the opportunity to show 
the causes which were at work and to show that these 
causes in many cases are operating to-day. Thus we 
lead to the student’s attempts to estimate the effects 
of these forces, both in the present and in the future, 
which is perhaps the chief use of history. 
No better exercise can be given a pupil in the history 
class than the task of finding out all he can about the 
history of a chosen occupation. Throughout the course 
he can collect and record information whenever it can 
be found, and may make interesting reports to the class. 
Community civics is rapidly replacing the civics which 
concerned itself largely with constitutions, terms of 
offices, and salaries of officers, and now children may 
study the complex, practical relationships of their own 
environment. 
Boys and girls must be taught the elementary notions 
of political economy, for the reason expressed by Jevons: 
If people do not understand a true political economy, 
they will make a false one of their own. [P. 11.] 
Occupational life should not be entered by the child 
until he has been given some idea of its problems. He 
should have an elementary knowledge of how he as a 
worker helps to pay taxes, how the tax money is spent, 
what rent includes, what profit is for, what are the prob- 
lems of the employer-employee relation, the elements 
of production, examples of codperation, the advantages

and disadvantages of competition, causes of unemploy- 
ment, thrift, and conservation. The work may be a 
combination of sociology, civics, and economics. Segre- 
gations in and definitions of the three fields are un- 
necessary; the consideration of practical problems is 
more important. 
Such studies cannot be postponed till the high school, 
because all our citizens need them.! 
How Science is Related to Vocations. — The last ten 
or fifteen years has seen a marvelous change in the 
teaching of elementary science, as a comparison of text- 
books will show. Formerly, curiosity was the chief 
interest appealed to; now use is becoming the test. 
Courses in nature study which classified insects and 
named curious botanical specimens have their place 
for children who find satisfaction in this kind of 
work. At the same time, however, the science which 
ties natural causes to their effects in street, stream, 
mine, factory, and farm also should have its place in 
the school. 
Drawing and Design. — The head of a high school 
art department is fond of saying that we neglect an 
important fact about the Greeks: though it is true 
that they adorned their homes and temples with beauti- 
ful statues, they also put artistic expression into the pots 
and pans of the kitchen. The courses in applied art 
and applied design reflect the modern desire to couple

theory and practice, ornament and use, appreciation and 
execution, “culture” and vocation. Drawing should 
be intimately related to manual training, and it should 
be freely used in studies like oral and written composi- 
tion, science, geography, and arithmetic. The ability 
to make a rough sketch is useful in many occupations. 
Many schools do efficient work in drawing, both in the 
elementary and in the high schools.1 
Higher Mathematics. — Much algebra and geometry 
as now taught is purely theoretical and might be sup- 
planted by problems related to needs. It is now recog- 
nized that a student may be taught to use the law of 
signs with perfect accuracy, even if he cannot explain its 
principle. The formula for the ratio of the circum- 
ference of a circle to the diameter may be grasped by 
analogy, without all the tedious drill on the logic, and 
time for practical applications may be gained. 
Other Studies may Become Vocational. — Any study, 
whether Greek or geology, is a vocational study for the 
few or many in the class who may find their interest to 
lie in that work and decide upon an occupation for which 
this study is a requirement. This is an argument, 
obviously, for a wide range of opportunity in school 
and school system. Further, higher vocational courses 
often require certain high school subjects, such as Latin 
and mathematics. 
The Manual Arts. — We shall speak in a later section

vocational; here we shall consider the manual training 
of the elementary grades. 
In the city of Los Angeles‘ there is an enrollment of 
about 52,000 in the first eight grades, not counting those 
in the intermediate schools. For these children ninety 
minutes weekly is devoted to manual training. About 
one hundred and six teachers are engaged full time in 
the work, besides nearly a thousand grade teachers 
who assist. In the first and second grades the fol- 
lowing are the activities: sand-table work, clay work, 
bead-stringing, seed-stringing, paper-tearing, cutting and 
folding, ruler work, paper construction, spool knitting, 
hand crochet, slat-weaving, paper-weaving, jute and 
raffia weaving, and knotting. The handwork is closely 
related to the drawing, music, nature study, gardening, 
and arithmetic. Woodwork extends from the fourth 
through the eighth grade. From the sixth grade on 
cement is used, and reed and textile work. Super- 
vision and assistance is given to the work which boys 
and girls do on their own account at home. Shoe re- 
pairing is taught at two schools. At another school 
all the work of the school restaurant — cooking, sewing. 
laundering, and cleaning —is done by the students. 
Sewing is carried on in all the grades, and cooking in the 
last three. 
In addition to the above described manual training, 
one hundred and one schools are doing work in gardening 
and elementary agriculture, with twenty-two special full-

time teachers. Each of nearly 12,000 pupils has a gar- 
den, with a total of eighteen acres under active cultiva- 
tion.! 
These activities show what can be done in the regular 
school, and the vocational values are evident. No 
better educational guidance can be given than the 
combination furnished by the manual arts, with the 
studies of the ordinary school program related to the 
vocations. As Eliot says, in discussing what studies 
the school should offer: 
The elements of the arts applicable in ordinary households 
and in various trades and callings ought to be carefully taught 
in all schools, public, endowed, or private, such as drawing 
and designing, domestic science and art and home economics, 
carpentry and joinery, and, in rural communities, agricul- 
ture.” 
It is important that manual work be made practical 
if it is to have any great effect in discovering aptitudes. 
Not ‘“ manual dexterity,” but rather the ability to grasp 
and solve problems is the aim—to repair a leaky 
faucet or a broken rake. The stage should be set 
for the occurrence of such problems. Occasionally the 
pupils should be brought face to face with a complex 
situation such as is presented in the farm or factory. 
The dramatization of actual trade conditions offers 
opportunity for relating the manual arts to the other 
1 Note that these figures relate to conditions before the world war 
began. The 1917 figure was 1800 acres.

work of the school. The importance of such manual 
training to vocational guidance is so great that it may 
almost be said that broad and practical manual training 
in the elementary school is indispensable for adequate 
guidance. Vocational counseling cannot be founded 
on a narrow school program. 
The Use of Museums in Connection with School 
Studies. — An undeveloped field in most cities is the 
use of museums. The 1915 report of the Commissioner 
of Education, Chapter XXII, surveys the work of 
museums, and a 1914 Bulletin! explains the work of 
the St. Louis museum. Such organizations as the Boston 
Children’s Museum minister to the interest which 
children have in the entertaining and curious, but they 
have little vocational significance. The Philadelphia 
Commercial Museum supplements the work of the 
schools in geography, commerce, and industry, and is 
of much greater use for vocational purposes than are 
collections of shells, stuffed animals, botanical specimens, 
insects, and the like, good as these may be. American 
curators still have much to learn from European in- 
stitutions, where attention is paid to both kinds of ex- 
hibits. In the scientific museum in Munich one can see 
the X-ray, diagrams of the chemical composition of 
common substances, the full-sized model of the shaft of 
a mine, models of canal-locks, pulley systems, ships, 
agricultural machines, bridges, etc., besides machines to 
illustrate the principles of many sciences. In the 
1No. 48, Rathman.

Museum of Arts and Crafts in Paris are shown industrial 
processes, safety devices, and models of factories and 
mines. In the South Kensington Museum of London, 
besides the extensive collection of scientific and industrial 
subjects, there are scores of models of machinery which 
may be set in motion by the pressing of a button. Here 
boys may study the steam locomotive from one model 
upside down, another cut into a vertical section in the 
middle and set up against a glass, and another with a 
section cut through one of the cylinders. 
So far as is known to the writer, no American museum, 
unless possibly that at Philadelphia and certain exhibits 
in the new National Museum at Washington, can com- 
pare in vocational helpfulness with any of these three 
European examples. Here is a big field for progress in 
our methods of teaching. Will not the museum and the 
moving picture teach much about geography and manual 
arts in the future school and thus play a large part in 
vocational guidance? 
New Subjects for the School Program. — The most 
important new study needed in the school program is 
a course on vocations. This course is needed in the 
elementary school, and it should be continued in the 
high school. As stated by Woods: 
We teach our youth about the characteristics of geographi- 
cal regions, the properties of numbers, and the peculiarities 
of language. As they go on with their studies we teach them 
the characteristics of chemical elements and compounds, 
the physical properties of bodies, the texture and mechanism
-P-A-G-E-88
    
78 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
of organic structures, both vegetable and animal, and their 
young minds unfold in the presence of a world richer and 
more complicated than they had ever dreamed. But about 
the qualities of men demanded by the world’s work, about 
the réle played by tact, by ability to meet men, by differing 
traits and tendencies of mind, as related to individual suc- 
cess in specific present-day tasks, we teach little. That 
the demands of one profession or craft are radically different 
from those of another, that the application of individual 
endowment to its appropriate task is a tremendously diffi- 
cult thing, they learn only in the wasteful school of experi- 
ree... 
Every boy before leaving the elementary school should 
be given an accurate idea of the nature of the principal 
kinds of human work, the qualities demanded by them, the 
preparation required, the rewards offered, the advantages 
and the opportunities for usefulness which they afford. 
He should, moreover, be taught the rudiments of self-ap- 
praisal from the vocational point of view and should have 
the benefit of counsel with a professional vocational counselor 
who is thoroughly informed with regard to the industrial 
opportunities of the community and the means of entrance 
thereupon.! 
Bloomfield states the need thus: 
Now real selection is impossible where the world of occu- 
pation is a dark continent . . . 
It is in our centers of population, in the apartment and 
tenement-house districts, that the masses of children are 
to be found. Here is much need for unfolding the pan- 
orama of occupations to the quick intelligences of the 
young people.”

  EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 79 
A school course in vocational information should 
aim to give needed direction for advanced education 
as well as for vocation. The course in the elementary 
school should aim to afford opportunity for an intelli- 
gent choice of a high school, and for the choice of the 
particular course. References such as the Boston School 
Committee Report of 1912, the Los Angeles Vocational 
Bulletin No. 1, the charts of educational opportunity 
in the Richmond and Minneapolis Surveys for Vocational 
Education, the Boston charts of the Women’s Municipal 
League, and the recent Philadelphia publication should 
be studied as texts for the course, and visits to the schools 
be a part of the work. Ina similar way, the high school 
course in vocations should use the catalogues of colleges 
and technical schools. The. high school should make 
the necessary connections with the elementary school, 
so that the advice given may be followed in the high 
school. Freshmen students in the high school need 
careful educational guidance. 
Turning to the high school course in vocational in- 
formation, the Grand Rapids plan, with the modifica- 
tions we have noted, may be followed. Another sug- 
gestive plan is that described by Superintendent Wheat- 
ley of Middletown, Conn., in the March, 1915, number of 
School Review. 
In a later place we shall outline a proposed plan for 
a life-career class.

dents with Each Other.—TIt seems likely that students

obtain more usable experience and information from 
contact with each other than they do from adults. The 
“ student activities,” which are frowned upon by many 
teachers as “interfering with school work,” have great 
vocational significance. 
We have already noted the serious and valuable 
lessons from early play, in imparting experience and 
interpreting to the child both himself and the world. 
Later play continues these processes, and brings out 
vocational tendencies. Philip Davis speaks of the need 
for the vocational counselor to take account of traits 
developed on the playground.t Not only do athletics, 
if rightly conducted, furnish necessary and proper ex- 
citement, but they test, select, and train, and this without 
the failures and disappointments often attending failures 
to pass in school work. ‘The activities carried on by 
the Boy Scouts and the Campfire Girls have the same 
good effects as athletics — everybody gains by trying 
the games and tasks proposed in their handbooks, 
even if he does not excel. 
The summer camp is a microcosm of the industries 
of a community, and may be made to offer unsurpassed 
opportunity for guidance.

and by the General Education Board ;? organizations

Rapids,! dramatics, and boys’ and girls’ clubs, all furnish 
preliminary and tentative specialization of an advanta- 
geous kind, and disclose vocational clews. 
Opportunity for participation in student govern- 
ment not only helps to teach civic rights and respon- 
sibilities, but it also gives play for tact and human 
intercourse which is important in the vocation. 
When shall we have, as a student activity or as a 
regular part of the school program, an organization 
and assignment of the janitor and gardening work about 
the school? Professor James’s celebrated pamphlet 
The Moral Equivalent of War, suggests the question, 
and if a beginning is to be made the schools must make 
it. Miss Lathrop? maintains that the janitor should 
be a teacher, and that the work of caring for the school 
should be done by the pupils as a regular part of their 
work. Claxton believes that the school should organize 
the labor of the pupils in such a way as to make it con- 
tribute toward their support. Many schools have made 
a beginning: furniture for the school department is 
made in the shops of the school, books are bound, 
printing done, automobiles kept in repair, lawns cared 
for, and heating plants managed, each as a part of the 
manual training of the school. 
How Club and Student Activities Enable the Child to 
Discover his Powers. — We shall now present some

SUMMARIES OF ACTUAL CASES, TAKEN FROM 
CORRESPONDENCE 
1. F. C. Studied electricity at a trade school, and be- 
came interested in the school paper. Went on Australian 
trip, and wrote constantly about the trip. Wrote a $75 
story about Hawaiian Islands. Took up work with Boy 
Scouts and wrote scout news for papers. Often went out 
on news details to accommodate one of the editors; finally 
went into the newspaper office as reporter for the waterfront 
1 Speaking of the work of the club, as it relates to vocational guidance, 
Major Sidney S. Peixotto, the founder and president, says: “I con- 
sider that the school studies have absolutely nothing to do with the 
vocational end of a boy’s life; I mean by this, no matter how good a 
boy is in study periods, it is really no positive indication of his . . . vo- 
cation. The true vocational guidance comes from the educational 
play given a boy. I include in this list of educational play: Dramatics, 
Dancing, First Aid, Gymnastics, Handicraft Work, Military Training, 
and Outdoor Athletics. Until the school includes most of these subjects, 
the difficulty of advising boys by teachers will be great. By studying 
a boy in his play activities, and by giving him serious tasks to perform in 
achievement work, I am able to decide upon a boy’s natural bent and 
to act as his guide in shaping his thoughts for life work... . It will 
be necessary for the schools eventually to go into the achievement idea, 
because it is only by example or illustration of actual conditions that 
children learn anything, especially those traits which are necessary to 
success in any vocation, — energy, work, and the need of long and care- 
ful preparation.”

district. Sees literary possibilities and intends to devote 
his life to writing. States that very few of the boys who 
studied in the trade school have followed the lines they stud- 
ied. “The architects seem to be the most consistent.” 
2. J. C. Joined club when very young. “I owe the 
shaping of my early life and the commencement of my prog- 
ress . . . to the environment and activity of the club.” 
Graduated from grammar grades and took a job driving a 
butcher wagon, with hours so long that night school was 
impossible. Was placed in another position by the club, 
and went to night school. “It was through the spirit of 
the club that I took full advantage of this, and I do not 
believe the education I received would have been obtained 
had it not been through this influence.” Has “been with 
several importing and exporting firms, but never deviated 
from this line of business.” Now managing one of the 
offices of a trading company. ‘It is needless to say that 
I cannot speak too highly of the club’s work. It puts the 
right kind of optimism and enthusiasm into a fellow that 
works wonders in after life.” 
3. M.S. Decision to study medicine was primarily due 
to home influences, “greatly augmented through my club 
experiences.” Was called “Doc” in club, on account of 
facility in bandaging blisters on walking trips. Club work- 
ers encouraged the ambition. Now taking a medical course, 
and earning $70 per month as a signal towerman at night, a 
position which gives opportunity for study. “TI believe 
that the club has been the most important influence in that 
with such a wide range of opportunities it gives one a chance 
to choose a line to which he feels best adapted.”

higher intellectual standards than my own. The influence 
of the club was on the moral and social side (social in its 
broader sense).” Now a civil engineer, and teacher in a 
technical evening school. 
5. A.J. T. States that the club offers opportunity for 
its members to become broader in ways often neglected 
by the other methods of schooling. “All the teaching takes 
place through actual practical experience. It does not in- 
struct its members what to do when they go out of the club, 
but actually goes through all this work with them. ... The 
club has been the means of putting all my other education 
into good and practical experience.”’ Professional cornetist. 
Got his start in the club band. 
Some Implications for School Authorities, from Club 
and Student Activities. — The obvious lesson from the 
guidance furnished by the activities of boys and girls 
outside the classroom, is that school authorities should 
systematize, organize, and encourage them so that they 
may have their full effect. Every schoolman or woman 
should read on scouting and play, school credit for home 
work! and such works as Denison’s Helping School 
Children. Too often the interests of children are ex- 
ploited by persons with goods to advertise, or directed 
by other persons who lack the educational aim. The 
only preventive is to substitute school control. Many 
principals have long used these interests as leaven in 
the school. In Chapter XII of Vocational and Moral 
Guidance, Jesse Davis outlines a plan. 
Student and club activities have too often been called

the “side shows ” of the school. Pending the awaken- 
ing of the teachers to the real opportunity these activi- 
ties offer, students who have seen both the side shows 
and the “main show ” will need to be convinced that 
the latter is the more valuable. 
The Prevocational and Continuation Schools as In- 
struments of Self-discovery. The Prevocational School. 
— The theory back of the prevocational idea has already 
been made clear. Parsons says that ‘a knowledge of 
each of the great classes of industry by practical contact 
is the right of every boy.” ! Goodwin says that there 
is a general agreement among those who have investi- 
gated the subject that but little can be done for the pupils 
who do not go on to high school, except as prevocational 
training, manual in character, is introduced into the 
elementary school.? The prevocational school is the 
so-called “self-discovery school.’ It aims to widen 
experiences, to present problems, to set the attention on 
projects, to teach the academic studies and the manual 
subjects in intimate correlation, to give children a well- 
planned “ jack-of-all-trades ” opportunity. 
Prevocational Education in the Public Schools, by 
Leavitt and Brown, goes into the subject so clearly and 
succinctly that we shall here call attention merely to 
two or three salient features, and answer some possible 
objections to the work, and some questions which arise. 
The extent of the school program, in a typical plan, 
is shown by the Boston list : 
1 Choosing a Vocation, p. 61. 3P. 130.     
-P-A-G-E-96
   
    86 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Academic studies: English (including penmanship, com- 
position, spelling), arithmetic, history, geography, hygiene, 
science, drawing. 
Manual studies for boys: Printing and _ bookbinding, 
metal work, electricity and power, shoe and leather work, 
clay and cement, woodwork, textiles, paper work, agricul- 
ture.! 
Manual studies for girls: Cooking, dressmaking and mil- 
linery, household management, textiles, sewing. 
Some distinctive features of the prevocational work 
in American cities are the following: the employment 
of teachers who have had actual shop experience; visits 
to factories, shops, and stores; assignment of projects 
away from the school premises, with boys in charge as 
foremen; competitions in workmanship; the use of 
commercial magazines and catalogues for study. The 
Boston prevocational centers have a Foreman’s Club, 
and publish a magazine called The Workmaster? 
Another feature must already have become obvious — 
that here is an ideal setting for effective vocational 
guidance. The teachers have shop connections, have 
few pupils and can become well acquainted with them, 
know the requirements of the occupations, and have 
abundant opportunity for observing the abilities of the 
boys. Naturally enough therefore, vocational guidance 
is a vital part of the work. 
1 It must not be thought that more than two or three of these subjects 
are offered in any one school, or that any great proportion of pupils are 
enrolled. The work is still in its beginning. 
2Leavitt and Brown, p. 235. See also App. E of the Minneapolis 
Report.   
  
-P-A-G-E-97
    EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 87 
One or two possible misconceptions concern our study 
of vocational guidance. First, is the prevocational 
work for the relatively dull boy? Practically, the work 
is expensive and cannot at once be thrown open to all; 
hence those who do not do well in the ordinary classes 
are often selected for the prevocational classes. Here 
many show at once that it was the work of the regular 
classes which was the misfit, rather than the boys. As 
a matter of future policy, no doubt all whose parents 
desire it should be allowed the broader program of the 
prevocational school. Second, are there boys with the 
“motor type” of mind who should be discovered and 
assigned to this work? In answer to this question we 
must say no; our reasons we defer to a later chapter. 
Third, is the name “ prevocational” well used, to 
describe this work? Bawden in the 1915 report of the 
Commissioner of Education raises this question.1_ The 
criticism of the term is just : these schools are for self- 
discovery, and in any given case a boy may discover 
here that he should be a teacher, lawyer, salesman, or 
merchant rather than a plumber or a printer. In 
this connection it is interesting that in one of the 
Boston classes in June, 1915, all of the fifteen graduates 
went on to high school.? Fourth, is this the same as or 
different from “‘ manual training” ? The discussion as 
to the aim of manual training is too large in its implica- 
E233. 
2See Bonser, “Is ‘Prevocational’ a Needed or Desirable Term?” 
His point is well taken: the intermediate or junior high school should 
do prevocational work.
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
tions for adequate consideration here. We may infer, 
if past development is to be continued, that manual 
training will cease to be justified by its supposed friends 
on the basis of its so-called “ training” or disciplinary 
value, that it will become more and more practical, 
and that it will finally be indistinguishable from what 
we now call prevocational work. Fifth, and last, is this 
kind of education for the boys alone, or for both boys 
and girls? Our answer is similar to that given to the 
first question. The work is new and more expensive 
than that of the ordinary classes ; the girls have protested 
less against the all-academic program, therefore they 
must endure it longer. Their turn for a broader pro- 
gram will come — indeed it has come in some schools. 
Continuation Schools, in their General Effect on the 
Vocation, are Similar to the Prevocational Schools. — 
Wisconsin, Ohio, and Massachusetts are the three states 
which have done most with continuation schools. So 
much experience has been gained that we are now re- 
ferring less and less to European example.! This ex- 
perience is convincing us that the continuation school, 
though completely different in organization from the 
prevocational school, must do the same work — must 
help the child to find himself. The data for this con- 
viction are so clear that it has been said that the 
continuation school should not even be called a finding 
but rather a reclaiming school (see statistics, Chapter 
1Some of the limitations in the German continuation schools have 
recently been pointed out; see Myers, Geo. E., pp. 9-11, 14, 16.
-P-A-G-E-99
  EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 89 
VI). Assistant Superintendent Thompson of Boston 
says that four fifths of the working boys under sixteen 
are merely messengers. President Miles of the Wiscon- 
sin State Board of Industrial Education states that 
“from fourteen to sixteen, eighty-seven per cent of 
working children are in dead-end, blind-alley jobs.” ? 
Thompson says that about one half the girls in the con- 
tinuation school are actually engaged in industrial pur- 
suits, and that some real continuation work can be done 
for them, as well as for the few boys who are in machine 
or printing shops.? It is evident from these studies 
that the children of the continuation school have not 
found themselves, and that the manifest duty of the 
school is to assist them in just such a way as does the 
prevocational school or the “regular”? school with the 
enriched and varied program. ‘ General improvement ” 
classes are organized in Wisconsin and in Massachusetts 
(Boston) continuation schools, and vocational guidance 
naturally forms a large part of the work. 
It is not necessary to ignore the present employment 
of the continuation-school pupil; it should be used as a 
probationary experience. Children should be trained to 
be efficient in to-day’s work, to broaden their vision 
and their business experience in their work as errand 
runners, to select their real vocations wisely, to prepare 
1 Nat. Assn. Manufacturers, p. 30. See other data in Chapter VI. 
2 Wisconsin experience in regard to girls has led to a different conclu- 
sion; see Wisconsin State Board of Industrial Education, 1914, pp. 
476-483, especially p. 479. Wisconsin has recently extended the con- 
tinuation school age to 17.

themselves definitely, and to recognize and seize oppor- 
tunities which present themselves. These things the 
continuation schools are trying to do, with what success 
may be judged by an examination of the growing litera- 
ture on these important experiments.! 
Definite Preparation for the Occupation. — We have 
so far considered the child’s place in the school, the 
school organization as related to vocational guidance, 
the possibilities for guidance in the curriculum and in 
student and club activities, and the prevocational and 
continuation schools as instruments of self-discovery. 
We now come to the consideration of the actual voca- 
tional training given by the school — the preparation 
for the occupation. 
Our study of the continuation school shows us that 
as a matter of general policy it is impossible to give real 
vocational training before the sixteenth year. And 
even if we begin our definite preparation at that age, 
experience shows us that we must still be ready for 
changes of mind and must provide also for the large 
number who may not yet have reached any decision. 
Thus we must constantly be ready to apply vocational 
guidance. With these provisos, what shall be the nature 
of the education which our secondary schools shall 
offer? Obviously, the high schools must offer continued 
experimentation or broad curricula for those who do 
not yet wish vocational training, and diversified voca-

ing to Continuation Schools, Boston Public Schools, No. 26, 1915. 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE gr 
tional preparation for others. Hence the need for edu- 
cational and vocational guidance throughout the high 
school is evident. 
What should be the nature of the vocational training? 
Fortunately there is a body of experience from which to 
draw. Schneider, Hanus, Gillette, Snedden, Leavitt, 
Thompson, Lapp and Mote, Eaton and Stevens, and the 
Richmond, Minneapolis, and Cleveland Surveys have 
put into available form what has been learned. 
It is needless in this book to treat of the many kinds 
of vocational education which are actually in opera- 
tion, and of the problems yet to be solved. On these 
problems are working both the layman and the educa- 
tor, and in the newer plans, employer and teacher are 
joining in the guidance of the high-school student. 
We refer, of course, to the codperative or part-time plan 
explained in Schneider’s book, and now in operation 
in many parts of the country.1 
No one can say what will be the terms upon which 
this codperative labor and education will be carried on, 
when experience has taught us. Devine said at the 
Second Vocational Guidance Conference:? ‘‘ Educa- 
tion and industry should get together, but it should be 
on education’s terms, not on industry’s terms.” IE is 
the paramount duty of the school and the employer 
to agree on such terms as will be beneficial for both 
the future worker and society. In this codperation 
1 See also McCann and Stimpson.

-P-A-G-E-102
    Q2 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
it is certain that both industry and education have much 
to learn, and that both will profit from the association.! 
With all the efficiency developed in vocational train- 
ing, the surprising fact must not be forgotten that 
many boys and girls decide on a vocation, learn the 
elements of that vocation in a high school, and succeed 
in their school work, but in the process of the learning 
broaden their horizon and choose another occupation. 
It would seem that even specialization must not be too 
narrow — vocational training must not close the door of 
opportunity —it must open several avenues at once. 
The boy or girl is likely to experience a progressive 
rising and clarifying of the vocational aim. 
The Development of Good Traits of Character. — 
We have already discussed the questions of respon- 
sibility and persistence, and we have shown how 
play and student activities aid in the development of 
persistence, habits of success, initiative, responsibility, 
and power to codperate. All these, however, good as 
they are, relate in the main to personal efficiency: 
their bearing on the habit of kindness and unselfish 
living is not so direct. We shall see in a later place 
that mere personal efficiency will not of itself solve the 
perplexing problems of our social life. The teacher and 
the counselor, therefore, must strive for a social efficiency 
which relates itself to the commandment to love one’s 
neighbor as oneself. No student of vocational guidance 
can tolerate the unsocial scramble for money or power.

It is the business of the school to make character count ; 
without it all guidance is vain. 
Some educators are fond of saying that this ideal is 
a matter of religion as distinct from morals. Be this 
as it may, the school cannot escape responsibility for the 
habits developed by the children in the school. In 
the first place, the school can help to prevent the many 
breaches of good taste and kindness due to thought- 
lessness. By example, discussion, systems of self- 
government, and punishments the school can put before 
the pupil the duty of consideration for the welfare of 
others. In a well-ordered school atmosphere it should 
be made hard for the selfish person, and unselfishness 
should have the reward of approval, respect, and satis- 
faction. 
In the second place, the school should plan coépera- 
tive tasks, both in academic and in manual work, so 
that the pupils will have training in joint action. This 
coéperative action should be so ordered as to show the 
pupils their own interdependence; for example, an 
investigation in community civics or the construction 
of a dozen desks may be planned in such a way that the 
advantages of codperation become apparent. Team 
work, obedience to rules and principles of conduct, 
and loyalty to aims, motives, and ideals may be taught 
in these ways, as well as in the play and athletic efforts 
of the pupils. “ School spirit,” with its loyalty to the 
worthy purposes and activities of the institution, fur- 
nishes a large opportunity for the wise teacher, principal, 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
and vocational counselor. No doubt these loyalties 
are far more efficient and lasting than any based on mere 
personality. 
Third, the attitude and habit of service may be cul- 
tivated. In the manual training work articles may be 
made by the younger children for the use of the older, 
and vice versa. Useful tasks for parents, city, school, 
and companions may be planned and encouraged in 
many of the classes; and the civics and history recita- 
ations may bring out the thought of service among 
adults. There should be no cant in the teaching; the 
teacher may deal with conditions in the business and 
industrial world candidly, but may point out the better 
way and the many indications that progress is being 
made. 
In dealing with questions of personal morality and 
self-control the task is more difficult. Negative advice 
— abstinence — has been to a large extent the tradi- 
tional method. Such a method has little effect unless 
it can be grounded on concrete facts. Thus, there may 
be cited the large and growing number of firms which 
object to the use of liquors on the part of their employees.! 
On the other hand, negative advice based on physio- 
logical considerations is notoriously dangerous. There is 
almost always an inevitable exaggeration of physical 
effects, which for many boys vitiates such advice. Again, 
1Some of them reject all users of liquors, but use a decoy question in 
their application blanks: “Are you a heavy or a moderate drinker?” 
or “Do you drink liquors? To what extent?”
-P-A-G-E-105
  EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 95 
fear does not deter, nor does mere knowledge; it is 
known that some men who know in detail the harmful 
effects of dangerous drugs fall victims to their use. 
Substitution is no doubt the safer and more effective 
way. If self-respect, honesty, and temperance can be 
learned through actions in which they play an important 
and necessary part, the opposite qualities would be 
avoided, in part if not altogether. 
The development of good traits of character should 
be the ubiquitous concern of the vocational guide. 
Though our discussion here is brief and inadequate, 
the character motive should be read into our treatment 
of all the other topics of the book. 
Summary. — The aims of education, and of educa- 
tional guidance, from the viewpoint of vocational 
guidance, are as follows: to study each child as a sepa- 
rate problem; to make the school organization flexible 
and to provide for the teacher’s playing the part of 
counselor; to turn to account the vocational possibilities 
of the school program and to add to the program an 
effective course on occupations; to encourage and direct 
such student and club activities as will contribute to the 
finding of vocational clews; to use the prevocational and 
continuation school for self-discovery, conservation, 
and reclamation; to provide in schools of secondary 
and college grade definite preparation for the occupa- 
tion; and to develop, with all, good traits of character. 
We have seen that much progress toward the realiza- 
tion of these aims has already been registered.
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Our next task is to study the methods of guidance 
which are directly concerned with individual counsel. 
It will become apparent, as the study proceeds, that the 
task of counseling is much more difficult than the task 
of guidance through educational experiences. This 
fact will present two ‘mplications: there is need for 
keeping boys and girls under the school influence as 
long as possible; and there is need for making that 
school opportunity count for educational and vocational 
guidance. When hundreds of boys say that they left 
grammar school before completing the eighth grade 
because they did not think it worth while to graduate, 
as they actually said in a recent New York investiga- 
tion, it discloses the character of the problems ahead 
of us. 
These problems are being attacked, with more and 
more approach to a systematic method. In the ap- 
proach, we find the study of conditions in the occupa- 
tions helpful. To a review of these conditions we shall 
come, first examining the plans for counseling individuals 
which are in common use.
-P-A-G-E-107
    CHAPTER IV 
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING AND THE WoRK OF THE 
CouUNSELOR 
The Need for Counseling Individuals. — ‘“ If I had had 
vocational advice when I was a boy,” recently remarked a 
college professor of sociology, ‘‘ I should probably have 
been guided into being a gardener.” The purpose of 
the statement was to show the danger in vocational 
direction. Admitting that an error would have been 
made in the case of the professor, is that a reason for no 
guidance? If the speaker had examined his own past 
experiences, he would without doubt find that he did 
have vocational counsel — that he had advice, encourage- 
ment, and direction while taking all the important steps 
in his career. Then how about the millions who drift 
blindly into and out of jobs? Shall we fear the error 
of making one less teacher, and thereby create scores to 
join the army of the misemployed? 
It may be replied that with the plans outlined under 
our study of educational guidance the individual will be 
enabled to find himself, and no actual counsel in the shape 
of personal conferences will be needed. There are 
several negations of this position. First, the enriched 
q 97
-P-A-G-E-108
    98 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
program often means increased bewilderment to in- 
dividual pupils unless they have sympathetic aid in 
making the decisions which the large range of choice 
entails. The course on vocations must necessarily be 
general in its scope; applications must be made concrete 
and individual, and this involves personal conferences. 
Vocational guidance cannot stop with furnishing a wealth 
of knowledge of opportunities and occupational in- 
formation; valuable as these are, they may still leave 
the boy or girl far from the desirable goal. The teacher 
who sets out to conduct a course in occupational in- 
formation will soon find individuals coming to him for 
personal advice; thus counseling becomes unavoidable. 
Educational guidance will probably mean not less but 
more counseling. 
A second reason why counseling will be needed is that 
with the best the school can do the child cannot be made 
fully to understand the importance of his decisions, and 
cannot be induced to make the most of his opportunities. 
There will be boys and girls who will derive little benefit 
from our elaborate plans while in school, but will be ripe 
for counsel after they have tried three or four jobs. Then 
the counselor must be at hand. 
Third, until we perfect our educational guidance there 
will be work enough with those who are employed but 
in great need of advice. As one of the letters to The 
Vocation Bureau states it: “I notice that your book, 
Choosing a Vocation, is widely circulated, but cannot 
think that it is of much advantage to the individual
-P-A-G-E-109

unless he has direct connection with some vocation 
bureau.” ! 
The Questions with which Counseling Deals. — We 
shall confine our study in this chapter to the legitimate 
ahd valuable factors of the process of counseling in- 
dividuals, leaving to the next chapter the criticism 
of some questionable practices which often pass for 
vocational guidance. We shall here consider the fol- 
lowing topics: (1) The use of tests; (2) Analyses of 
personal qualities; (3) Record cards; (4) Guidance 
through placement; (5) Employment supervision; 
(6) The work of the employment manager; (7) Some 
special plans; (8) The collection, classification, and use 
of occupational information; (9) The equipment of the 
counselor. 
The Use of Tests. — Almost any kind of a test is called 
a “psychological test ” nowadays, and the usual effect 
of the term is to give such tests a vogue without proper 
inquiry as to their utility. This overestimation of the 
potential and actual value of laboratory tests has done 
much harm to the cause of vocational guidance, and will 
be discussed in the next chapter. We are concerned here 
with what can be done. 
Dr. Ayres, writing in October, 1913, says: 
   
    
          Even after all allowances are made, the inevitable conclu- 
sion remains that in vocational guidance the greatest field

ings, p. 92.

100 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
of immediate development for psychological tests is in choos- 
ing persons for positions rather than in selecting positions 
for persons." 
Now since the teacher, the counselor, and the young 
person himself are concerned with the second of these two 
operations, that of finding a vocation or position for a 
boy or girl, psychological tests do not appear to offer 
help to them. Rather the tests seem to aid only the 
employer, who of course has the position and wishes to 
select the person to fill it. 
On the same topic, Bloomfield, in Youth, School, and 
Vocation, says: 
It appears that if facilities for competent research are 
provided, the general decision concerning relative fitness 
for (x) advanced education for expert scientific, technical, 
or professional service; (2) clerical or office work; and (3) 
mechanical or trade and factory work can be based in part 
upon a psychological inventory taken as early as the age of 
fifteen (pp. 60-62). 
   These two statements seem to be the most hopeful 
views of the situation with regard to the present contri- 
bution of. psychology to vocational guidance. (Some 
others seem to be too sanguine and are treated in the next 
chapter.) Let the counselor get what comfort he may 
from these hypothetical advantages; the fact remains 
that much is yet to be done before practical use can be 
made of psychological tests.    
    1 Proc. of Nat. V.-G. Assn., 1913, p. 37
-P-A-G-E-111
    VOCATIONAL COUNSELING IOr 
What then can tests do? In the first place, inves- 
tigations such as those being carried on in Cincinnati 
may finally give helpful results to guide us. Mrs. 
Woolley’s plan is to make frequent tests of groups of 
children in school and at work — tests which are of 
great variety and several times repeated — and to keep 
a record of the successes of these children in the occu- 
pations. She then hopes to be able to find a basis of 
correlation between the records in the tests and in the 
occupations.! This experiment suggests a point so far 
almost completely neglected by the psychologists — the 
testing of a person’s capacity for improving. Perhaps 
general “improvability ” cannot be tested; clearly, 
however, it is more important in a beginner than present 
knowledge or skill, and frequently bears little relation 
to initial performance. 
In the second place, laboratory tests may for the 
present be abandoned, so far as vocational guidance is 
concerned, and actual standardized work tasks sub- 
stituted. The records of the child in such tasks, and 
his capacity for improvement, if a series of tests can 
measure it, may be taken as a basis for forecasting 
1 See her plans and preliminary report in the references in the bibliog- 
raphy. (Her conclusions that there are types of mind will be discussed 
in the next chapter.) It is only fair to note that the tests Mrs. Woolley 
has used are those for psychological ages, and not at all for vocational 
aptitudes. Further, even psychological ages tests have not been stand- 
ardized or agreed upon for a period of years. Again, even if positive 
correlations between tests and occupational success are found, we can 
never be sure that other occupations might not have proved more suc- 
cessful.
-P-A-G-E-112
102 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
probable success.1 The achievement tasks and prevo- 
cational work, of which we spoke in the last chapter, 
would go far toward becoming adequate tests of ability. 
The part-time or coéperative plan will serve as an actual 
trial of the worker’s ability, if the entrance into the work 
is carefully supervised. 
School examinations may be much improved, and may 
in time become the best of all ‘‘ psychological tests.” If 
the psychological investigations were made in the actual 
schoolroom in codperation with the teachers, it seems 
likely that much more progress would be made than we 
can hope to make with researches apart from the school. 
Thus the psychologist may study the interests of pupils 
as expressed in their choices of studies, games, and sub- 
jects for oral and written composition; aid the teacher 
in grading for difficulty a series of lessons in arithmetic ; 
study the correlation between school marks in English 
and in science; help the teacher in planning better 
examinations in geography; plot individual learning 
curves for records in a series of examinations in stenog- 
raphy. The codperation of the trained psychologist, 
the vocational counselor, the teacher, the employment 
supervisor, and the employment manager, may in time 
yield some examinations which will aid in the work of 
selecting a vocation. 
Analyses of Personal Qualities.— The attempt to 
name and classify the human virtues is as old as the time 
of Homer; we shall not try to add another schedule. 
2 See Thompson, 1915 Report of Comm. of Educ., p. 291.
-P-A-G-E-113
    VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 103 
The review of long lists of desirable qualities is a favorite 
exercise of the business man who is asked to address a 
body of high school students. But what the students 
need is the experience of actual situations in which these 
virtues play a part. Thus, a better lesson can be drawn 
from a class discussion on the question, ‘‘ What would you 
do if you found a counterfeit half-dollar in your pocket ? ” 
than on the question, ‘‘ Why is honesty necessary in 
business? ” 
In the Grand Rapids plan “ the elements of charac- 
ter that make for success in life,” are taught through 
biography, discussion, compositions, and self-analysis. 
(Davis states that the last must be used with dis- 
cretion.) The book, Vocational and Moral Guidance, con- 
tains directions, sample compositions, and bibliographies. 
Several high schools (e.g. in Los Angeles and Boston) 
attempt to obtain a composite judgment on each pupil, 
as a basis for office information in regard to him, and for 
possible recommendation to an employer. A list of 
pupils is presented to each teacher, the names being 
followed by columns labeled at the top: Reliability; 
Scholarship; Initiative; Appearance; General Char- 
acter, etc. The marks used designate Excellent, Good, 
Fair, and Poor, and the teacher fills the columns for what- 
ever students he knows well enough. The results are 
tabulated in the principal’s office. They show, for 
example, that three teachers have marked Harry White 
excellent in initiative; ten have marked him good; and 
two, fair. Such judgments should be of value, though
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
too often the teachers have a very limited experience 
with the children. 
It must be noted that virtues are specific things and 
not general; they are carried over from one situation 
to another only as the two situations have similar char- 
acteristics, or as special effort is made to secure the 
transfer. Thus, a boy who is industrious in his school 
work will be industrious in his home duties only as the 
two situations are similar, both possessing such elements 
or ideals perhaps as emulation, graduated progress, 
intelligent supervision, and satisfactory results. Much 
of the ‘moral suasion” used on children is based on 
the theory of general discipline, as we shall see in the 
next chapter. Children are told that they must learn 
persistence, as if this quality could be absorbed from 
following the plow and then automatically transferred 
to the task of studying Latin. It is now seen that 
good habits must be consciously and persistently re- 
lated to the second field of action before there can be 
any great likelihood that they will be transferred. 
Self-analysis, too, should be based on one’s measuring 
himself by concrete tasks rather than by qualities ab- 
stracted from their environment. An illustration from 
the experience of Miss Ginn, Director of the Voca- 
tional Guidance Department of the Boston schools, 
will indicate a legitimate and helpful method of self- 
1 Teachers who have had to fill out a statement upon a boy who has 
applied for a bond will realize how little the classroom work tells about

analysis. When she was in charge of an eighth grade 
class of girls she asked them to state what they intended 
to be, and eighty-five per cent gave stenography as their 
choice. After a few days had passed the girls were asked 
in a class exercise to make a list of the qualifications of 
a good stenographer. They responded with many items, 
all of which were placed on the board and allowed to re- 
main some days. Then the girls who had chosen stenog- 
raphy were asked to measure their own personal qualities 
by the requirements there stated. The same exercise 
was carried out with other occupations. A few weeks 
later, when another poll was taken, the per cent of 
stenographers had dwindled to eleven, showing that the 
exercise had made the girls more critical in their thinking. 
Character analysis, then, like psychological testing, 
must be based on the actual tasks which children will 
be called on to do. 
There are two characteristics, or habits of conduct, 
or states of mind — whatever they be called — which 
seem to be present as common elements in most of the 
situations of life. Therefore they may be spoken of 
in general terms, and they possess a large degree of 
transferability. We refer to the habit of codperative 
service and the habit of succeeding. Manifestly it is the 
school’s duty to see that these powers have play in all 
legitimate ways. 
Record Cards. — The best practice seems to indicate 
that the counselor rather than the child should fill in 
most of the answers on the record blank. If the child
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
does the work unaided, either the question may be mis- 
understood, or the answer made to fit what the child 
thinks is wanted, or the temptation to vary from the 
exact truth may be presented. Frequently the counselor 
will find it necessary to ask three or four questions, in 
order to obtain a satisfactory statement to fill one space. 
What questions shall be asked? The literature of 
vocational guidance is full of sample record cards,! and 
the total list of questions asked would range from the 
now notorious, “ Does your mind concentrate or skip 
around?” to the query, “ What service to the com- 
munity are you planning to render through your voca- 
tion? ” 
Of all these blanks the simplest are the most workable. 
For the average child two thirds of the questions on a 
card with many spaces to fill have no significance what- 
ever. It seems best, therefore, to ask a minimum 
number of questions and to allow space for comments 
on other significant facts discovered in the conferences. 
Thus the teacher or counselor and the child are enabled 
to save time and to concentrate on vital matters. The 
blank with forty or fifty questions is usually never all 
filled in, and is unwieldy for actual use. 
The Boston cards on pages 192-193 of Youth, School, 
and Vocation are concise and workable. This question 
might be added, perhaps; Use of time outside of school

U.S. Com. of Labor, 1910, Chap. XV, p. 441; Davis, Vocational and 
Moral Guidance, pp. 78-80, 143-144, 253-272.
-P-A-G-E-117
    VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 107 
hours, in work, recreation, and clubs. The question on 
future vocation may be broadened to include the three to 
five occupations which are under consideration, arranged 
in the order of present preference. At the bottom of 
the card could be filled in the composite record’ of 
teachers’ opinions suggested above. , 
It is a serious question whether or not unfavorable data 
should be put on cards. There are some strong reasons 
against the practice. First, the cards should be trans- 
mitted through the grades, and it is unfair to the child to 
prejudice him in the eyes of a new teacher. Second, 
the importance of unfavorable comments, if placed on 
record, is likely to be exaggerated — they strike the 
attention of the reader and suggest more than they 
should. Third, we guide the child by means of his 
successes and not through his errors; his mistakes may 
often best be forgotten. Keeping them on record 
after they are corrected is a poor policy. 
Even such questions as those relating to physical dis- 
abilities, past sicknesses, and “‘ hereditary ’’ weaknesses 
are open to objection, on similar grounds. Hurried 
judgments on these objectional questions are useless if 
not injurious. Some cards examined recently bore such 
statements as: hereditary tendencies — rheumatism, 
scar over eye; past illnesses — measles, appendicitis, 
scarlet fever (no other statement). Such statements 
tell nothing about the vocation. There is no general 
agreement on the complex questions of heredity, and 
it seems useless to parade before the child the possibility 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
eee ee 
108 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
of duplicating in his life the diseases of his parents. 
Teachers are ordinarily not well enough informed to be 
discriminating, and frequently attach more importance 
to the influence of heredity than do those who have 
studied the subject more deeply. An examination upon 
entering every job, as is enforced in Boston, and a 
general question on the child’s blank, such as, “ Are 
there any common occupations or kinds of work he 
should avoid? ”’ would seem to be sufficient. 
Religion should not be entered on a card. If place- 
ment is the issue, a general question about regular work 
and holidays will serve the purpose. 
We have said above that the record cards should 
be passed on with the pupil. This does not mean that 
they should remain unchanged. Horton! tells of the 
advantages of a new card each semester, and Mrs. 
Woolley speaks of the child’s being followed through the 
school by a kind of cumulative judgment of his various 
teachers.? The Boston card provides for changes of 
plans. The card should bear spaces for additional in- 
formation at any time, and for the date and significant 
facts of each conference between the child and his 
counselor.> 
Guidance through Placement. Its Advantages. — 
The placement office has undeniable advantages for 
1P. 40. 2 Proc. of Sec. Nat. Conference, p. 85. 
% This counselor may be the child’s teacher, though there should be 
provision for distinguishing in the record the occasions when the pupil 
is counseled by the specialist in vocational guidance in the school or 
vocation bureau.  
-P-A-G-E-119
    VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 109 
exercising guidance: the applicant is receptive to advice ; 
the officers are in close touch with the needs of occupa- 
tions; placement saves the young people from the 
dangers involved in wandering about in the streets and 
offices looking for work; the placement officers are in a 
position to do good “ follow-up ” work; the reaction on 
the school can be made effective for better school work. 
The Disadvantages of Guidance through Placement. — 
On the other hand, there are certain dangers involved in 
guidance through placement. In the first place, the 
name placement itself suggests inactivity on the part of 
the applicant, — that he is a pawn to be moved into his 
space. “Pegs” are to be fitted into “holes.” If we 
could see certain economic and social conditions im- 
proved, it might be far better for young people to find 
their own places. This proposition we shall discuss in 
Chapter VIII. 
Second, placement is never finished; it is a process 
which must be so often repeated that the machinery for 
adequate placement in a city would be so unwieldy as to 
be very likely to fall by its own weight. The Boston 
Placement Bureau manages, apparently, to keep sight 
of the individual, but the report of the continuation 
school shows that the bureau secured places for only 
one and eight tenths per cent of the children enrolled 
in the school. In order to place and to follow up 
even this number an elaborate card system must be 
prepared and kept as nearly up to date as the facilities 
of the bureau will allow. No one can prophesy what
-P-A-G-E-120
  IIo THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
kind of records would be needed for placing all the work- 
ing children of Boston, or whether it would be possible 
to organize the work in one office. It seems certain that 
a system so extensive would lose sight of individual 
problems. 
Third, placement does not begin the guidance soon 
enough. The placement bureau cannot be said to give 
effective guidance if it has no conferences with the boy 
or girl before he or she comes to find work. It should 
become an axiom of vocational guidance, that effective 
direction demands long-continued personal acquaintance, 
advice, and occupational preparation before the time for 
work arrives, and supervision and counsel during at least 
the start in the occupation. Mere placement of the 
child, even when well done, deals with a very limited 
part of the problem.! 
Fourth, placement officers are tempted to take the 
viewpoint of the employers and this tends to have an 
unfavorable reaction on the school. The good-will and 
codperation of the employer is desirable and important. 
But his needs should not be set up as a sole measure of 
school efficiency. An employment agency of any kind, 
1 Jesse Davis has well stated the complexity of the problem of place- 
ment, showing how it fails if it does not come as a step in the larger 
welfare of the child (p. 156). Davis maintains that there is no “best” 
job for a fourteen-year-old child. 
2In a recent continuation school lesson much was said about obeying 
orders, being respectful to superiors, being worth what you are paid, 
and the like. Loyalty and obedience were enjoined, and the lesson 
plan proceeded from parents to employer to God. One might have 
imagined himself in a Munich school.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING Et 
even if it be a public institution, is likely to harbor the 
idea that the school is or ought to be training children 
exclusively for efficient employment. True, this is a 
desirable by-product, but even if all children were 
destined for permanent positions in subordinate employ- 
ment, it does not follow that they should be trained with 
this in mind as the goal. 
Fifth, placement under present circumstances, com- 
peting as it must with private employment agencies, 
does much for the employer without being able to demand 
much in return. A placement officer recently spent a 
day’s time in filling four places. The work was well 
done, and a considerable amount of money was saved 
to the employers. If anything is given by these em- 
ployers in return it is at best intangible, voluntary, and 
subject to reversal at their pleasure. Under a system 
of genuine employment supervision, the employer might 
be required to chart the jobs, to maintain healthful 
conditions of employment, to pay adequate wages, and 
to call in the counselor for a hearing before discharging 
the boy. 
Sixth, a final objection to a placement bureau in con- 
nection with guidance is that it behaves as did the Arab’s 
camel. Vocational guidance should be the master; 
placement should serve the vocation. But the act of 
getting the boy a job seems such an important achieve- 
ment (justly so, in many cases) that the deeper problems 
are relegated to a subordinate place. The results of 
placement are easily appraised: “‘ This office last year
-P-A-G-E-122
  I12 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
placed 145 persons in positions with aggregate earnings 
of nearly $15,000.” Such a report seems to be a tangible 
one when read by the practical man. The work of the 
vocational counselor cannot be put on paper in any such 
shape. Well may he say, to school committee or tax- 
payer, 
After such argument what can I plead? 
Or what pale promise make? 
Yet we know that the need for adequate vocational 
guidance is a pressing one and that it can be defended 
successfully to any school committeeman who will con- 
sider the whole problem broadly. 
Are the Placement Bureaus Efficient in Guidance ? — 
We come now to the practical question: Do the place- 
ment agencies use even those facilities for guidance which 
they have? Miss Odencrantz, to whose article we have 
already referred, states that her investigations in New 
York City give her evidence which ‘‘ may be taken as an 
indication of the lack of realization on the part of these 
workers that they are actually undertaking any sort of 
vocational guidance. It likewise indicates limited efforts 
in relating the child to the proper kind of work. It is 
nearly always a case of any job that may happen to 
come up for any girl who happens to be at hand.” She 
states further that even the organizations which are 
carrying on the work of placement more or less definitely 
do not perform one of the fundamental duties and 
iP. 176.

responsibilities of the noncommercial placement agency, 
— the duty of making preliminary investigation of the 
industry or establishment, before sending girls into it. 
Obviously, then, if the placement bureau is to hold 
any advantage over the commercial employment agency, 
its organization, equipment, and ideals must be improved. 
Perhaps the greatest advantage possible to the publicly 
managed bureau is its power in many cases to put children 
back into school. Dr. Edward T. Devine puts this 
point as follows: 
There is a great deal of sound doctrine in the idea that 
the only place to put people under eighteen years of age is 
in school, and we assume a serious responsibility if we in any 
way seem to give prominence to the idea that the chief task 
is to put people into positions rather than to keep them out 
of positions. 
The experience of placement bureaus suggests the 
need for scholarship funds, and for an investigation to 
determine whether or not the bureaus actually find for 
the average boys and girls better jobs than they could 
find for themselves. There are degrees of placement 
activity: some systems allow for independent action on 
the part of the applicant, while others exercise un- 
warranted paternalism. 
The Cleveland office has a staff of fifteen persons, 
and aims to return children to school whenever possible. 
No boy or girl is placed without a study of his school 
record, and the attempt is made to give all attention

-P-A-G-E-124
  TI4 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
possible to the vocational aims and abilities of the 
applicant, and to follow his progress in the occupation. 
The office is under state and city control. 
The Cincinnati Department of Child Labor is under 
the supervision of the school board. It is intimately 
related to the schools and to industry, and aims to pro- 
vide vocational guidance beginning with the application 
of the child for a work certificate. 
The Boston Placement Bureau! is intimately related 
to the work of the Vocational-Guidance Department, 
and the placement feature seems here to have something 
like its proper subordination. The director was formerly 
in charge of the placement bureau, and states that of the 
three functions of the vocational-guidance department — 
guidance, placement, and follow-up — placement is the 
least important. Assistant Superintendent Thompson, 
who is in general charge of the work, says that just now 
follow-up is the most important, for through this the 
school gets guidance —it sees the causes of its own 
failures and successes, and learns how to improve its 
own work. 
Employment Supervision. — It seems fair to state to 
employers of labor that theoretically all children should 
be in school, and that if they are allowed to work, on 
account of economic needs, their labor should be super- 
vised by school authorities. The age for compulsory 
attendance has been progressively raised, and there 
1 This organization has now been taken over by the school committee 
and incorporated into the Vocational-Guidance Department.
-P-A-G-E-125
  
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING II5 
seems to be no reason for believing that the limit has 
been reached. Minnesota has now set the age at six- 
teen, and Wisconsin requires continuation schooling for 
workers up to the age of seventeen. 
The Need for Employment Supervision. — From the 
economic and social standpoint, the worker needs the 
protection which a supervisor can give. The factory or 
mercantile system does not automatically protect its 
workers — the interest of the managers is directed into 
other lines. Hence the demand that somebody actually 
representing the public be appointed to follow the child’s 
career in the occupation. It is true that the more pro- 
gressive firms are organizing employment managers’ 
departments. But these represent the firm and not 
the children; when adjustments seem difficult to make, 
the settlement finally agreed upon in every case should 
be for the public good. 
Most of all, the employment supervisor is needed as 
vocational counselor for the young person who is in an 
occupation for which he is not adapted — who feels 
that he is a misfit. Again, the supervisor can counsel 
when advice is wanted on any of the problems which 
arise: when to ask for a promotion, which of two 
opportunities to choose, what processes in a given indus- 
try to learn, what advanced study to undertake, what 
openings there are ahead and how to prepare for them, 
when to seek a new place.!

Bureau, —a boy quit work because he decided that it offered no future

  116 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
| 
The Advantage to the Employer. — The enlightened 
employer welcomes such supervision, for it enables him 
to call in the aid of an understanding friend whenever 
advice is necessary. It has been the experience of men 
and women engaged in such supervision that employers 
desire to be fair to the boy or girl, and are willing even to 
see him leave for a better place. No doubt the system 
of competition in which employers find themselves offers 
temptation to unfairness. But the evils of this system 
itself would be greatly ameliorated if adequate super- 
vision for young people in employment were widely 
enough extended. 
Follow-up Work. — The first step toward employment 
supervision is taken when school people investigate the 
experiences of those who have left school, as did the 
teachers of the Mishawaka high school when they looked 
up the graduates for ten years back to find out about 
their work and wages. Strictly speaking, this form 
of follow-up does not involve actual supervision. But 
the expression “ follow-up ” is often used to mean over- 
opportunity; the firm, however, stated that the boy had a good oppor- 
tunity for promotion. Here is the place for a conference to see what 
definite proposition can be made to the boy. Another employer asked 
the bureau for a messenger boy. The placement officer got him to admit 
that there was no opportunity for promotion, and then had him agree 
to the plan to take a boy with the understanding that in a year’s time he 
was to leave for a better position, and a new boy be supplied. (See 
Breckenridge, for further data.) 
1 Experience has so far been limited; it is not possible to infer that 
this kindly attitude would be universal. If supervision is needed for 
educational and sociological reasons, it must come regardless of the 
attitude of those who represent narrower interests.
-P-A-G-E-127
    VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 117 
sight as well as investigation. Investigation should pre- 
cede and lead to supervision. 
Examples of Employment Supervision. — Though the 
simpler forms of follow-up are now very common! it is 
difficult to find examples of employment supervision with 
authority and equipment for adequate work. 
The most elaborate employment supervision yet 
worked out is that which is a part of the codperative or 
part-time plan. The system is explained by its origi- 
nator, Dean Schneider of the College of Engineering, 
University of Cincinnati, in Chapters IX and X of his 
book Education for Industrial Workers.2 The work of 
the “codrdinators”’ is treated on pages 56 and 57. 
These officers are employment supervisors; their duty 
is to see that the shop work is educative and the school 
work practical. They have authority to protect the 
worker: “No girl or boy may be exploited by over- 
zealous foremen, as the visits of codrdinators prevent 
this.” 
Other cities which have codperative or alternate-week 
plans which involve the supervision of the start in 
industry are Dayton, Rochester, Buffalo, Boston, 
Fitchburg, Chicago, and Solvay, N. Y.; and many other 
cities have made beginnings. 
There is, of course, extensive inspection and supervision 
of industry in connection with the enforcement of the

labor and health laws of city, state, and nation. Though 
this inspection is not concerned with the educational 
welfare of the workers, much can be learned from its 
organization and method. In Chapter VIII we shall 
outline a possible plan for employment supervision. 
Vocational Guidance through the Employment 
Manager. — Perhaps the most hopeful improvement 
within industry itself is the recent organization of em- 
ployment departments in many establishments. These 
departments are directed by employment managers, 
who attend to hiring and discharging workers, training 
the new employees, supervising the conditions of labor, 
adjusting work to workers, carrying on social work among 
the employees, and otherwise aiding in making the 
workers efficient and satisfied. 
The Kind of Work Accomplished by the Employment 
Manager. — In the factory of the Dennison Manufactur- 
ing Company at Framingham, Mass., progress has been 
made in charting or “ blue-printing ” particular jobs. 
The employment manager, Mr. Philip J. Reilly, can 
tell in advance just what each of the one hundred and 
fifty jobs requires and offers. For example, it can be 
specified that the girl who is to work at covering jewelry 
boxes must have small, fine, but strong hands, not too 
ill-used by housework, be right-handed, have had a 
better education than the average, and have a good 
sense of color and design. Other jobs present significant

for a treatment of that subject.

specifications: one requires standing; another hammer- 
ing; a third the use of glue, with its disagreeable odor; 
another knowledge of the use of fractions; another the 
use of inks and dyes. A special effort has been made to 
transfer persons from one department to another, to 
avoid dissatisfaction, discharge, or leaving. During 
the year 1915 ninety-two per cent of the transfers were 
successful, and there were only 13 cases of voluntary 
leaving, out of a force of 2300. In the same year forty 
per cent of the transfers were to better positions. This 
company has taken stock of the educational opportunities 
of the community open to workers, for the purpose of 
advising its employees. 
H. P. Hood and Sons of Boston have an elaborate 
system for teaching the duties of milk-delivering to 
new employees. The plan is a model of definite- 
ness and good pedagogy — an improvement over the 
old method of ‘trial and error.’”” The operation of 
the plan is supervised by the employment man- 
ager. A council of employees hears appeals and 
complaints. 
William Filene’s Sons Company of Boston have 
developed many democratic features. Teaching new 
employees, hiring, transfer, cases of discipline, and dis- 
charge are under the supervision of the management, 
but an appeal may be taken to a council elected by such 
workers of the store. Further details in regard to the 
plans will be reserved for our study of conditions of 
employment in Chapter VII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  120 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
The reaction on the men acting as employment 
managers is one of the most significant features of the 
work. The humanizing influence in securing satisfied 
employees is in evidence. One of these employment 
managers recently spoke of the responsibility in con- 
nection with discharging a man who earned no more in 
a week than he, the manager, earned in one day. An- 
other manager stated that a worker earning only nine 
dollars a week should not be subject to discharge by 
the whim of any one person. A third remarked: 
“Most of us are everlastingly good bosses but very 
poor teachers.” It is not claimed by these men 
that they are doing their work for humanitarian rea- 
sons. Mr. E. A. Filene recently remarked that there 
is no occasion for any gratitude on the part of em- 
ployees; they are not getting any more than they 
are giving. 
Employment Managers’ Associations. The Boston 
Association. — Boston, New York, Detroit, Chicago, 
Philadelphia, and San Francisco now have organizations 
of employment managers, meeting regularly for con- 
ferences on current problems. The Boston Employment 
Managers’ Association was the first organization in the 
field; it was formed in December 1911 by the Vocation 
Bureau. The membership is about 125. It holds 
monthly meetings with programs of talks and discussions 
arranged in advance by a program committee. Occa- 
sional meetings are held at the places of business of the 
members, for the purpose of observing the methods of

handling the employment problems in the various 
stores and factories. A paid secretary has recently been 
employed, and a systematic program of work has been 
planned. A recent circular letter to the members out- 
lined the scope and character of the problems, and work 
of the association.! 
Other Employment Managers’ Organizations. — In 
New York, the Society for the Study of Employment 
Problems plans to study the following topics: sources 
of labor supply; selection of employees; analyses of 
jobs; conservation of employees, including methods of 
training, ways and means of promotion, physical condi- 
tions, records of employees, and means of remuneration ; 
reasons of and methods for discharge. 
In Boston the women interested in these subjects have 
organized the Employment Problem Association, and 
are making similar investigations. Some of their meet- 
ings will take the form of joint meetings with the Boston 
Employment Managers’ Association. 
The associations in the other cities are working along 
similar lines. 
Coéperation of the Associations with Education. — 
All of these associations admit educational people to 
their membership, and there is much promise of genuine 
codperative effort toward a solution of the perplexing 
questions of employment. It was the work of the Boston 
association which led to the college course in Dartmouth, 
which we have noted in Chapter II. Recently the

Massachusetts Institute of Technology has organized 
courses to train men for the business management of 
engineering establishments. ‘ 
The first national conference of employment managers 
was held on January 19 and 20, 1916, at Minneapolis, in 
connection with the ninth convention of the National 
Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education. This 
meeting was addressed by persons representing colleges, 
factories, commercial organizations, and the United 
States Department of Labor, besides the associations 
of employment managers.' 
Some Special Problems and Methods of the Counselor. 
The English Plan. — The English plans for counseling 
proceed on the assumption that no central office in a 
large city can keep in personal touch with the individual 
child. Hence their provision for large volunteer com- 
mittees. Each child is put in touch with an adult who   
      
will take a personal interest in his school, home, and 
working affairs, and who will do everything possible 
to foster his development and progress. The children 
are assigned to these “helpers” about three months 
before the school-leaving time, and the helper under- 
takes to keep in touch with the child for about three 
years. Only a few children are under the direction of 
each helper. Conferences with parents, teachers, and 
employers are frequent. Helpers keep records of their

and Philade!phia were published by the United States Bureau of Labor 
Statistics.

work, and a central office holds conferences and correlates 
the work.! a 
Superintendent Spaulding advocates the adoption of 
this use of volunteer help in America. After speaking 
of the part to be played in guidance by pupils, parents, 
and teachers he says: 
In my judgment they must all take a part, but their work 
to be successful must enlist the codperation of high-minded 
and public-spirited men in the busy world who are ready to 
give society the benefit of their experience and aid the ris- 
ing generation by their suggestions and advice. Such men 
can help enormously in this great task.? 
Methods of Inducing a Young Person to Change his 
Aim. — How shall a boy or girl be induced to reconsider 
a determination to be lawyer or doctor or engineer, 
when it appears that he has no conception of the battle 
ahead of him? The obvious thing to do is bluntly to 
say to him: ‘“ You have no chance to be a lawyer.” 
But that such a statement is the wrong one to make has 
been abundantly proved, for the strangest things have 
happened to make success possible.* Direct counsel 
of a negative sort is inappropriate; a different method 
must be used. That employed in the case of the girls 
who chose stenography is suggestive (p. 104). Another 
1 Explanations here apply particularly to Birmingham, whose plan 
is typical of the best. See Bloomfield, The School and the Start in Life,

good method is used by F. M. Giles 1— the method of 
giving information which will show the difficulties as 
well as the advantages of the occupation. Many 
decisions of children have been made on insufficient data, 
and therefore more data are required, especially about 
other desirable occupations. When the teacher as 
counselor has done these things he had better let the 
pupil do the rest. Either he will have experiences that 
will teach him or lead him to change his mind, or he will 
succeed at the occupation he has chosen, regardless of 
apparent handicaps. 
Counseling in Grand Rapids High School. — Six 
teachers of the Grand Rapids High School have three 
recitations each, daily, and give the remainder of their 
time to the work of counseling. Each is responsible for 
the educational, moral, and vocational guidance of 
about 250 pupils. They keep record cards for these 
pupils, and act as a cabinet of vice principals for the 
advice and assistance of the principal.” 
Policies of Counseling in Boston. — The Vocational- 
Guidance Department of the Boston schools holds that 
no vocational counselor should take the responsibility 
for telling a boy or girl what he can or cannot do. The 
director believes that just as a guidepost tells which 
turns must be made to get to certain places, but leaves 
the decision to be made by the traveler, so the vocational 
guide should tell what must be done to reach any

occupation (and what the occupation offers), and must 
leave the final choice to the boy or girl. 
The Civic Service House, in which the modern voca- 
tional-guidance movement originated, has recently out- 
lined a plan to be used in the conferences held with its 
members : 
EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
CIVIC SERVICE HOUSE 
1. Preliminary interviews are held, to discover experi- 
ences, successes, abilities, and aims. Parents and house 
workers are sometimes present. General advice is given, 
perhaps in regard to reading on occupations, advanced study, 
or visits to schools or other places. 
2. Investigations are made by the house workers, to deter- 
mine the desires and resources of the parents. 
3. A conference committee, made up of the house workers 
and the officers of the Vocational Bureau, holds monthly meet- 
ings at the Vocation Bureau for the consideration of cases. 
4. The recommendations of the committee are carried 
out, so far as possible. The resources of the house and of 
other organizations are used in whatever way seems neces- 
sary to extend the education and the opportunity of the per- 
sons who are counseled. 
At What Age should the Vocation be Chosen? — 
Counselors are sometimes asked this question by anxious 
parents or “ practical” friends of the child. It is im- 
possible to answer ; generalization here is quite gratuitous. 
Yet the dangers connected with too early or too late 
choices are serious.
-P-A-G-E-136
    126 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
The enrichment of the school program will undoubtedly 
furnish an educational guidance which will disclose aims 
and abilities much sooner than would the narrow pro- 
gram. Yet the child has only a child’s experiences, 
and there are certain occupations whose requirements 
and opportunities can hardly be appreciated by a person 
under twenty-one; for example, those of the lawyer, 
the statesman, the social worker, the college teacher. 
The problem can be solved only by opening wide the 
opportunity for education and range of choice: by in- 
creasing the vocational infancy of all those young persons 
who are likely to profit by the delay of choice. The test 
to be applied should be progress in profitable lines of 
applied study. .The prevocational age for certain occupa- 
tions may be extended into the twenties. Note that the 
prevocational idea involves work. There is only gain 
to the individual and to society from profitable, super- 
vised work, if such work is educational in its functioning 
and effect. Thus, the future statesman may run errands, 
the lawyer wire a house, the preacher lay a cement side- 
walk, and the college president work as clerk in a store, 
all with educational profit to the individual and to 
society. 
Do early choices persist? Peixotto (p. 82) thinks 
that vocational clues of a reliable sort begin to manifest 
themselves between the ages of eleven and fourteen years. 
Thorndike has computed for 100 individuals the re- 
semblance between relative interests and _ relative 
capacities as 0.9, and between interest in the last three
-P-A-G-E-137
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 127 
years of the elementary school and capacity in the college 
period as 0.6. He concludes, “ These facts unanimously 
witness to the importance of early interests.” ! 
It is always unsafe to apply conclusions based on 
averages — or on 60 or go per cent — to the individual 
case. We can never know which is the exception. Too 
many “ average ”’ boys and girls have broken the rules 
of averages. A case from a current magazine illustrates 
the way late choices are made. The Polish novelist 
Stanislaw Przybyszewski went to Berlin in 1889 at the 
age of twenty-one to study architecture. He soon 
changed to the study of physiological psychology, but 
in 1891 became editor of the Berlin Arbeiter-Zeitung and 
leader of strikes in Silesia. In Berlin he began to write 
on philosophical subjects, at the age of thirty became 
editor of a literary magazine in Cracow, and thence 
went to Warsaw and devoted himself to drama. He is 
now engaged in writing novels and in lecturing.” 
As we remarked in another place, a person’s aim is 
likely to change as he proceeds in study and work, and 
his period of vocational exploration may be extended so 
long as he is occupying the time in ways profitable to 
himself and society. A forced choice might lead to un- 
happiness and disaster. 
Making Alternative Choices of Careers. — Apparently 
one precaution worth taking, in order to prevent early 
mis-choices, is to suggest to the youth that he select

from three to five occupations for consideration and 
study. He may then keep in mind throughout his life 
one or two occupations other than the one he decides 
upon, so that if a change ever seems desirable, it may 
be made without too much diffculty. 
The Collection, Classification, and Use of Occupational 
Information. — In order to do effective work, the teacher 
and the counselor must know about the world of occupa- 
tions into which the children are to enter. He must 
collect, classify, and use significant vocational facts. 
Collecting Information. — In the collection of occupa- 
tional information much may be learned from the 
methods employed in recent surveys of school systems, 
and of surveys for vocational education. The Port- 
land, Oregon, Survey devotes two chapters (VI and VII) 
to the vocational needs of the city, and the Cleveland 
survey devotes nine of the twenty-five booklets to the 
occupations of that city in relation to schooling. The 
Richmond, Minneapolis, and Indiana Vocational-Educa- 
tion Surveys come nearer still to our purpose: all are full 
of information very much needed by the counselor in 
his work. 
Much as these surveys are to be commended, they have 
a slightly different aim from that necessarily taken by 
the counselor. The survey for vocational education 
aims to find out (1) what are the occupations of the com- 
munity, with the requirements of each; (2) what the 
vocational-education opportunities are; and (3) what 
educational advantages should be provided to meet the 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
    VOCATIONAL COUNSELING r29 
requirements. The survey is not necessarily concerned 
with asking whether or not the occupations should be 
improved, whether or not there should be supervision of 
employment, what provision for placement there should 
be, or what system for guidance should be inaugurated. 
The vocational-guidance survey wishes to know all that 
a vocational-education survey can tell, and is interested 
besides in such problems as those noted above. 
Comprehensive surveys for the express purposes of 
vocational guidance are rare, though the surveys made 
by the Vocation Bureau while training the Boston 
school counselors were for explicit use in vocational 
guidance. We have spoken ofa follow-up investigation 
in which a high school finds out what its graduates are 
doing. Such a study involves visiting stores, factories, 
offices, shops, and other establishments, asking questions 
about the occupations, and then using the information so 
obtained in improving the school and guiding pupils. 
Such an investigation is a rudimentary vocational-guid- 
ance survey, and has no doubt been attempted by many 
schools. A city or school system survey for the purpose 
of vocational guidance would be of national help and 
importance. 
1On page 8 of the Minneapolis Survey is given a statement of the 
aims of the survey. It should be noted that this particular study (as 
well as the Richmond Survey in some particulars) goes further than its 
aims require: it is critical in its examination of the occupations, and 
makes frequent recommendations of great significance to vocational 
guidance. Chapter XXIV makes some suggestions for a program of 
vocational guidance.

What Information shall be Collected? — The first 
requisite is to know what toask. Dr. Richards, Director 
of Cooper Union, gave an adequate answer to this 
problem at the Second National Conference on Voca- 
tional Guidance.’ He classifies the necessary questions 
under the following heads: the economic data, the effect 
of the occupation on body and character, the data on 
opportunity for beginners, and the relation of the 
occupation to school training. Following is a brief 
summary of the questions he proposes: 
Wat wE NEED To Know AgBout OccupPATIONS 
I. Economic data: 
1. What is the size and importance of the industry, nationally 
and locally ? 
2. Is it a growing or a diminishing field? 
3. Is the occupation overcrowded? 
4. Is it stable, or likely to change on account of invention 
or the whim of the public? 
5. What are the hours of labor, and the rules about overtime ? 
6. Is the pay by time-work or piece-work ? 
7. How is the work in the occupation subdivided? What 
proportion of the work is desirable? 
8. What physical and mental qualities are necessary for 
success and efficiency ? 
II. Physical and hygienic conditions: 
x. Is the work carried on indoors or outdoors? 
2. Does the worker sit or stand for long periods, or move 
about ? 
3. Is there ample room and good ventilation ?

4. Is the worker exposed to heat or cold or sudden changes of 
temperature ? 
5. Is time allowed for dinner, and is there opportunity for 
warm meals? 
6. Does the work involve strain to eyes or nerves? 
7. Are there dangers from machinery ? 
8. Are there dangers from dust ? 
g. Are there any special unhealthy conditions which might 
lead to occupational diseases ? 
III. Influence of the occupation on the character and 
growth of the workers: 
1. Is the occupation stimulating, or deadening? 
2. Are the influences surrounding the work morally deterio-

V. The relation of the occupation to school training: 
1. Is school training beyond the legal requirement an ad- 
vantage in the occupation? Beyond the grammar school? 
2. Is high school training an advantage? Vocational school 
training? 
3. Which are of greatest help: General knowledge? Indus- 
trial and economic intelligence? Specialized technical knowledge? 
Manipulative skill? 
4. How should the instruction be obtained: Before entrance 
to occupation, or after? In evening schools? Part-time school? 
Are there facilities for such schooling? Are employers willing 
to allow part-time schooling, without reduction in wages? 
Dr. Richards’ paper is well supplied with examples to 
illustrate the points covered in this outline. He remarks 
that these data are not needed alone for vocational 
guidance, but also for the general improvement of social 
and ecenomic conditions. A significant statement is 
his observation that the work of vocational guidance 
need not wait until these facts are fully collected. 
The questions in the above outline cover the ground 
in comprehensive fashion. The variations in the require- 
ments, as given by various writers, and as applied in 
actual surveys, may be noted by referring to the literature 
of the subject. f

     VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 133 
Selecting Significant Facts. — The complexity of the 
occupational world makes it absolutely necessary to 
select from the mass of facts those which have special 
bearing on the work of the school and especially on 
vocational guidance. The field schedules for the voca- 
tional-education surveys are very complex; a glance at 
the large tables in the Richmond Survey will show how 
necessary is the selection and emphasis of significant 
facts, if the counselor is not to be lost in a maze of 
irrelevant details. The field investigator himself may 
aid the selection by underlining or checking items of 
special significance as he gathers data, and by making 
some general comments about the occupation or estab- 
lishment. Field books should provide space for these 
comments. 
After the facts and comments are gathered, they should 
be studied and put in shape for use. Vocational spe- 
cialists may want to have access to all the facts, while 
teachers, parents, and children want brief statements 
and significant conclusions. The returns from the 
surveys must therefore be reduced to a form appropriate 
for general use. This seems to have been the aim in the 
reports of the Cleveland Survey; not only are there 
eight booklets each devoted to one group of occupations, 
but there is also one book devoted to the findings for 
all. The Rochester school department has utilized the

  134 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Chamber of Commerce survey from which to summarize 
for vocational guidance the main facts about several 
occupations, in very brief form. Bulletin No. 3, 
Clothing Industry for Girls, has five pages of text, and 
treats of the following subjects: size of the industry, 
divisions of the trade, the season, the kind of girl desired, 
the pay, hours, labor laws, location of shops, and where 
to learn operating and buttonhole making. 
Frequently the Chamber of Commerce of a city may 
be induced to assist in the publication of the booklets, 
if not in the expense of collecting the information. Thus 
the Gesellschaft zur Beférderung der Kiinste und niitz- 
lichen Gewerbe of Hamburg stands sponsor for booklets 
so economically gotten up, in the printing and binding, 
that they can be revised and kept up to date with a 
minimum of expense. 
Too often in the past the sole printed matter in con- 
nection with painstaking surveys has been the large 
volume called the report — a forbidding document except 
to a few experts. It is now recognized, apparently, 
that new methods of disseminating the findings are 
needed, and brief, popular summaries should do much 
toward making vocational guidance practicable and 
systematic. 
Who should Make the Surveys? — We have indicated 
already that the vocational-guidance department of the 
school board or committee should follow the children 
1See also the Chicago bulletins reprinted in Bloomfield’s Readings, 
PP. 542-556.
-P-A-G-E-145
    VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 135 
into the occupations, and should supervise their employ- 
ment. In connection with these processes they should 
make investigations which can furnish information for 
counseling children still in school. This information 
should be systematically gathered, tabulated, verified, 
and kept up to date, and should serve the purposes of a 
vocational-guidance survey.1 
The occupational information should be kept ready for 
reference in a central office, and may there be accessible 
to state and federal officers. The State Bureau of Labor 
Statistics should sift and tabulate the information 
collected by local authorities, publish exhaustive reports, 
and issue brief bulletins of a popular nature useful to 
parents, teachers, employers, workers, and school classes. 
The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, in turn, should 
collect, compare, correlate, tabulate, and disseminate the 
material from all the states, and should issue popular 
bulletins for the use of all classes of people. 
These reports, of course, should by no means be limited 
to mere facts or statistics; in spite of the name Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, used in the case of state and federal 
boards, a glance at their reports will show a very wide   
      
range of powers. These bureaus are well equipped to 
aid the movement for vocational guidance. 
1 As a matter of fact it should be better than a formal survey, for the 
latter is apt to be thought of as completed, while the information should 
be always growing and being revised. The formal, occasional survey 
is useful when information is lacking on account of past neglect, but 
it is not an ideal plan for keeping information aboyt occupations up to 
date.
-P-A-G-E-146
I 36 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Coéperation of the most far-reaching nature should be 
practiced in collecting the occupational information. 
The following organizations, among others, should 
contribute: employers’ associations, labor unions, cham- 
bers of commerce, manufacturers’ associations, employ- 
ment managers’ associations, teachers’ organizations, 
state commissioners and superintendents of education, 
health boards, employment bureaus, professional and 
civic clubs, settlements, private schools, newspepers, 
civil service commissions. Of special aid will be the 
Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Education, and the 
Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, and Labor. 
Until such time as facilities for collecting the appro- 
priate information are adequately provided, the teacher, 
principal, or superintendent can do what the Boston Vo- 
cation Bureau has done: investigate typical, important 
occupations, write concise explanations of them, submit 
the copy to employers, workers, and economists for 
correction and suggestion, and publish the resulting 
material in the form of pamphlets or booklets. 
A glance at the current Manual of Examinations of the 
United States Civil Service Commission? shows what 
might be accomplished by a more extensive use of 
agencies already in operation. For example, the follow- 
ing is an extract from the stated requirement for Press 
Feeder in the Government Printing Service :*

tion for themselves: Westgate.

    VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 137 
No application is accepted which does not show that the 
applicant has had either (1) at least three months’ experi- 
ence and has fed, at the rate of 1200 sheets per hour, sheets 
not less than 24 by 38 inches in size on a cylinder press or 
sheets not less than 14 by 17 inches in size on a platen press, 
or (2) at least three months’ experience in packing and band- 
ing cards of approximately 34 by 5} inches, at the rate of at 
least 300 packets per hour. 
Any boy studying the work of the press feeder may 
measure his potential abilities by these standards. In 
Section 249 of the same bulletin the specifications for 
stenographer and typewriter are outlined, sample tests 
are published, and definite standards set. No source 
of information gives more promise than that represented 
by federal and state departments of government. 
Classification of the Material for Use in Counseling. — 
The classification of occupations must be simple and 
brief, if it is to be used with young children to aid them 
in getting acquainted with the world’s work. Two such 
classifications, one for boys and one for girls, are given 
by Davis on pages 67 and 69 of Vocational and Moral 
Guidance. The divisions for boys are: agriculture; 
business; professions; industry; unclassified. For 
girls: household arts; agriculture; business; industrial 
arts; professions; special occupations for women. 
Bonser accepts the fivefold division: professional, 
commercial, agricultural, industrial, and household 
Woods has eight classes for boys: professional, mer- 
1 Readings, p. 110.
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
cantile, petty mercantile, clerical, artisan, laboring, 
agriculture, miscellaneous.! The census classification 
has nine divisions, and if home making be added, ten: 
agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry; extraction 
of minerals; manufacturing and mechanical industries ; 
transportation; trade; public service; professional 
service; domestic and personal service; clerical occupa- 
tions. 
All of these classifications are open to the objection 
that they are logical rather than pragmatic; they do not 
aid the child by relating the occupations to his own life, 
abilities, and ideals. The counselor may therefore enlist 
the aid of the young people, and they may build up 
classifications of their own, based on special points under 
consideration. For example, the members of an oral 
English class debated in an informal way about the useful- 
ness to society of certain special occupations, after which 
they took a vote of first, second, and third choices. 
Another classification interesting to young people is 
based on these questions: What occupations are so 
important that organized society manages them? Which 
ones are so important that voluntary organizations 
manage them without making any profit? Which are 
so necessary that society officially recognizes and regu- 
lates them? Which are privately managed, but held as 
necessary? Which have to do with mere luxuries? 
Which are prohibited? 
Other bases of profitable classification are suggested 
1 Readings, p. 26.
-P-A-G-E-149
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 139 
by these questions about a given occupation which a 
boy or girl might be studying: Is it a purely automatic 
process? Does it take semi-attention? Does it take 
occasional thinking? Does it require continued think- 
ing? Does it take strength, size, use of eyes or ears? 
Still another basis for study is indicated by such ques- 
tions as: What occupations are open to a boy equipped 
with a good knowledge of chemistry? Mechanical 
drawing? + 
The work in agriculture fostered by the Massachusetts 
State Board of Education is planned so that the exercises 
are graded with the easiest first and the most difficult 
last. Thus the pupils have a useful classification within 
the field of agriculture.” 
Certain classifications once useful but now of no practi- 
cal value should be avoided, for example that based on 
the materials used in the occupations: the woodworking 
trades, the iron trades, etc. Materials are no longer of 
sufficient significance: certain processes in wood, metal, 
and leather may all involve the manipulation of machines 
requiring almost identical dexterity. 
No doubt the life-career class may consider the common 
classifications of occupations. The pupils should be 
shown, however, that there are many practical problems 
not at all settled by such classifications, and that they 
can hardly choose a vocation without a much more

dustry was published recently in School and Society (Garnett). See 
also Richards’ questions, above.

significant analysis of its characteristics than any these 
classifications furnish. 
The Use of Vocational Material in Counseling. — 
Bloomfield, in speaking of the work of the counselor, 
says: 
Prolonged, earnest effort on the part of the counselor 
is imperative, and a corresponding effort on the part of the 
applicant, or the service fails of results. 
One of the chief duties of the counselor is to assist the 
pupil in a systematic study of the occupations which he is 
considering. Attractive reading matter must be as- 
signed, both general and particular in scope and nature. 
The use of this material must not be limited to local 
opportunities, for Ayres’ study of thirteen-year-old boys 
in seventy-eight cities shows that only one half of them 
were living in the city of their birth, and of the fathers but 
one in six.? As the pupil proceeds in the study of his 
occupation, he must have the benefit of frequent con- 
ferences with the counselor. He should be encouraged 
to discuss his problems with parents and friends, to talk 
over with other pupils the reading he does, and to 
make it the basis for some of the work in the composi- 
tion and oral English classes. Literature sent to the 
parents, with an invitation to a conference, will aid 
in the work materially. 
The use of vocational material in life-career classes has 
been discussed in the chapter on educational guidance.

   VOCATIONAL COUNSELING I4I 
The Equipment of the Counselor.— The “ blue- 
printing ” of the task of the vocational counselor has 
been adequately and acceptably done by Professor 
Bonser in the article to which we have already referred.1 
Four specifications are named: information, experience, 
appropriate personality, and capacity for constructive 
research. Of special significance for our purpose here 
is a study of the equipment of the counselor as expressed 
in the judgment of men who have had years of experience 
in the work — such men as Parsons, Bloomfield, and 
Davis; to the writings of these men the reader is 
referred.” 
An attempt to add to these statements about the equip- 
ment of the counselor, or to formulate a new set of 
specifications based on the present study, would involve 
a summary of the topics of our entire book. We shall 
therefore defer further consideration of the subject 
until we have completed our study of the conditions in the 
occupations and have come to the discussion of normal 
school and college courses to prepare for counseling. 
The Teacher as Counselor. — It is hoped that Chapter 
III has made it clear that every teacher of the school has 
opportunities to give vocational guidance. The present 
chapter aims to show that individual conferences are 
needed by the children — conferences with persons spe- 
cially equipped to give more nearly adequate guidance.

-P-A-G-E-152
  142 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
What should be the relation between the fleacher and the 
trained counselor? Obviously the supervision of the 
work should be under the direction of a man or woman 
trained for that work; obviously, also, the classroom 
teacher should do all he can in guiding the pupils, because 
he is nearest to them. It seems safe to say, then, that 
the trained counselor’s function is to direct the work, 
to furnish teachers with whatever helps he can, to meet 
with and advise pupils whose problems need more atten- 
tion than their teachers can give, to conduct life-career 
classes, and to attend to the activities which have to do 
with employment supervision. 
No matter how efficient and enthusiastic the trained 
counselor may be, however, the success of his work will 
very largely depend on the attitude of the teachers of the 
school system toward the work. It is to be hoped, there- 
fore, that the increased professional training of teachers 
will help to equip them for an interest in guidance and 
an ability in counseling. In the last analysis, perhaps 
most of the actual counseling should be given by the 
child’s teacher, and the director should devote the greater 
part of his time to the effort to train special teachers in 
each school for the work, and to aid all the teachers in 
developing the viewpoint of vocational guidance in the 
studies of the school program.

   CHAPTER V 
PsEUDO-GUIDANCE 
In our study of pseudo-guidance we may concede 
that most intentions are good, and we shall not go so 
far as to label all the methods discussed as entirely 
false and pernicious. But we shall maintain that ex- 
perimentation should not be considered as vocational 
guidance, and that no method should be adopted into 
a plan for guidance until it has adequate foundation 
in logic and in good educational practice. Vocational 
guidance is still in the experimental stage, — that is 
very true; but enough experiments have been carried 
on, in certain lines, at least, to show better ways than 
these we shall consider in this chapter. 
The many questionable practices in attempted voca- 
tional guidance may be classified for our purpose by 
the theories or points of view on which they rest. We 
shall distinguish the following: (1) Belief in the un- 
proved theory that there are fixed and well-marked 
types of mind; (2) Overestimation of what psychologi- 
cal tests can at present do; (3) Belief that qualities 
of mind are general and transferable, rather than spe- 
cific; (4) Overestimation of the importance of physical 
characteristics; (5) The encouragement of morbid self- 
143  
-P-A-G-E-154
  144 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
examination ; (6) Overguidance; (7) Commercial agen- 
cies; (8) Lack of social perspective; (9) Control of 
vocational guidance by other departments or by non- 
educational organizations. 
Belief in the Unproved Theory that there are Well- 
marked Types of Mind. — Are there distinct types of 
mind? It must be admitted that the evidence, from 
authority, at least, is imposing. Let us see if it is con- 
firmed by experiment, note how the theory works in 
practice, and judge it by its fruits. 
In our treatment of this subject we shall consider 
first, the common classification into object-minded and 
symbol-minded, second, other classifications by types, 
and third, the educational implications of the theory 
of types. 
Are there ‘“ Thing-thinkers ”’ and ‘“ Idea-thinkers ” ? 
—A New England superintendent of schools said re- 
cently that at the age of thirteen two types of children 
are discoverable — the bookish and the manual. In 
another city the school psychologist has organized a 
“ practical-arts ” class for the ‘“ object-minded,”’ leaving 
the “ symbol-minded ” in the regular classes. Another 
classification has it ‘motor-minded” and ‘“ mind- 
minded ;” another “ concrete-minded”’ and “ abstract- 
minded;” another ‘‘dynamic” and “sedentary.” 
Sincerely interested in the vocational guidance of the 
students, an enthusiastic vice principal wrote an 
article for the school paper, in which occurred this 
statement: ‘ 
   
-P-A-G-E-155
  
  PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 145 
Are you mechanically dexterous? Are you a handy boy? 
Then surely the industrial world with its crafts and its trades, 
its manufacturing, and its mechanic arts, should be your 
choice. 
Mrs. Woolley, in her recent preliminary report of the 
Cincinnati investigations,! distinguishes four types: 
x. Low in mental and physical tests of ability. 
2. Low in mental but good in manual ability. 
3. High in mental but low in manual ability. 
4. High in mental and manual ability. 
It is to be noted that the second and third of these 
“types” are respectively the “ finger-minded” and 
“idea-minded ” of the other classifications, and that 
the first and fourth classes violate the theory of distinct 
types. Mrs. Woolley does not tell us the proportion of 
children in each of the four classes. An attempt to do 
this would probably break up the classification. She 
does tell us, in another article,? that 149 children were 
tested with regard to their simple motor and mental 
abilities, and it was found that those who were best 
in the mental tests were also, on the whole, best in the 
physical tests and in physical development. 
Types of Thinking vs. Types of Mind. — That there 
are types of thinking no one doubts, nor that there are 
boys and girls who like to use their minds through the 
use of their hands, nor that some boys and girls are more 
practiced in one kind of thinking than in another. But 
so far in the study of “ types,” there seems to have been 
1 New Scale, etc., p. 533- 2 The Present Trend, etc., p. 46. 
L  
-P-A-G-E-156
    146 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
no investigation made regarding the causes of these 
variations. As a substitute for such investigations, it 
has invariably been assumed that because John likes 
to think by means of driving nails we know that he is 
manual-minded, or, put the other way about, John 
belongs to the manual-minded type, therefore he likes 
handwork rather than bookwork. 
We still have no proof that these explanations do any 
more than travel in a circle. It may be that book- 
work has been made unattractive, that the wrong kind 
of reading matter has been set before the boy. We 
know how assiduously many a boy has read about elec- 
tricity, because he was constantly using his hands in 
making and installing electrical apparatus. May it 
not be that it is the business of the school to balance the 
kinds of activity for the child, rather than to unbalance 
them? At least this proposal has as much evidence in 
its favor as the other, and that it leads to a sound or- 
ganization of the school program is shown by the fact 
that nowhere has prevocational work led to the ex- 
clusion of the ‘ symbol-thinking,” but always to a 
strengthening and vitalizing of it by relating it to the 
manual work. The implication seems to be that the 
symbols in the old school were symbols of vague things, 
while those in the prevocational academic work are to 
be symbols to represent pragmatic things — chairs, 
processes, acts of helpfulness, success in planning and 
in working, concrete and satisfactory accomplishments. 
If our school work can offer to all pupils a varied
-P-A-G-E-157
  PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 147 
program of really useful studies, shall we not have less 
need to ferret out types of minds to put into different 
kinds of schools ? 
What Experiments have Shown. — Thorndike has 
summarized the arguments against the theory of dis- 
tinct types, and has given the experimental data on 
both sides of the argument. 
In the first place, it is significant that almost every 
experimental study of types has led to two findings: 
first, there are many more individuals between or com- 
bining the types than there are in the types themselves ; 
and second, various intermediary types are discovered. 
In the studies of imagery the division into auditory, 
visual, and motor types, on which methods of teaching 
spelling have been based, has given way to intermediate 
classifications which include most of the children. 
Thorndike quotes Meumann as stating that no child 
of pure type has been discovered, and Segal as intro- 
ducing a type called “ visual-auditory-motor-intellec- 
tual!” ? Between two so-called types there are so 
many other cases that the total representation approxi- 
mates the curve of normal distribution. So far as can 
be found out, no distribution by groups has been found 
true for any mental quality, unless special training or 
accident be the obvious cause.’ Thorndike concludes his 
examination of certain experiments : 
1See his Educational Psychology, Vol. III, pp. 360-363, 367-371, 
and Chap. XVI. 
2 Thorndike, p. 374. 3 Thorndike’s Briefer Course, pp. 404-410.
-P-A-G-E-158
  
  148 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Intermediate conditions are in some of these cases de- 
monstrably, and in all cases probably, more typical than 
the supposed type. [Vol. III, p. 381.] 
Again: 
It is highly probable that, when actual measurements are 
made, mediocrity — ... moderately everything will be 
found to be the one real type. [P. 375.] 
Mrs. Woolley’s conclusion that ability in manual and 
mental activities are in positive correlation is borne 
out by Thorndike’s review of the experiments. He 
finds that desirable qualities stand in positive correla- 
tion to each other, — that it is not proved that there 
are “mental antagonisms,’ a person being good in 
manual skill but poor at abstract thinking. “ The 
good external observer may be excellent at introspec- 
tion, and the man with a strong interest in his inner 
life of thought is much more likely than the average 
man to have a strong interest in external affairs.” [P. 
382.] ‘It is very, very hard to find any case of a nega- 
tive correlation between desirable mental functions.” 
[P. 362.] 
What shall be done with the “ Manual Type ”?— 
Without doubt the student of vocational guidance 
wishes to foster the introduction of more handwork 
into the schools; without doubt also, however, he must 
protest at assigning a thirteen-year-old boy to a class 
which will become for him an educational blind alley. 
There are teachers, college presidents, dentists, lawyers,
-P-A-G-E-159
    PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 149 
and preachers who would have been called ‘“ object- 
minded ” had they in their school days fallen into the 
hands of an enthusiastic “ psychologist.” How can we 
know that the boy who is just now disinclined toward 
Scott’s Lady of the Lake, and toward a classification 
of sentences into simple, complex, and compound (sym- 
bols which probably no one can show him have any 
value), — how can we know that he should therefore 
be guided into a mechanical career? Perhaps he 
should cultivate his manual powers, but at the same 
time have an education so broad that the way 
may be kept open for him to become a teacher of 
manual work, an industrial manager or foreman, a 
manufacturer, a salesman, a chemist, a surgeon, a 
patent lawyer, an employment manager in an indus- 
trial plant, a scientific farmer, or, indeed, a professor 
of philosophy. 
Not only, as suggested above, is there a likelihood 
that we should find upon investigation that the habit 
of thinking most practiced by a given boy is due to 
influences in his past and present environment, but 
there is also a possibility that an individual changes 
his habit of thinking as he grows older. Thus Winch? 
found evidence that children change their imagery from 
auditory predominance to visual. As there are times 
and circumstances in every day when one favors either 
abstract or concrete thought, so there are likely to be 
periods in his life given over to one kind of thinking 
1P. 460, see bibliography.
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
more than to the other. If such an hypothesis be 
even a remote possibility, it is unwise for us to limit 
the opportunity of any individual. 
The way should be kept open for any development 
which may arise in the child’s manner of thinking; he 
should be trained to both kinds of thinking by both 
mental and manual work, and should be taught the 
value of abstract thinking about the hand work he is 
doing. Correlation of the kinds of activity is the task 
of the teacher. 
Finally, too much stress should not be put on the 
boy’s present stock of aptitudes, in his choice of voca- 
tion. As Thompson! says from his experience with 
Boston boys: 
Grit and courage, I believe, have more to do with success- 
ful adjustment to the job than special aptitude . . . Moral 
attitude has scored to count more than fortunate mental 
and physical gifts. What vocational counselor would have 
advised the youthful Demosthenes to study oratory? 
Other Classifications by ‘ Types.” — Classification is 
such an alluring temptation that it is not surprising 
there should be a liberal assortment of categories into 
which to pigeonhole any particular individual. Thus 
we find Schneider, from his experience in Cincinnati, 
proposing sixteen ways of dividing twenty-year-old 
boys into two classes:

Schneider hastens to warn us of the danger of hasty 
judgment, and to state that one may belong to both 
types, — may be “ both mental and manual, or both 
an indoor and an outdoor man”; and that “ further, 
one may not possess either characteristic to any marked 
degree.” Like Mrs. Woolley, however, he does not 
estimate the relative number belonging to well-marked 
types and not belonging to such types. 
We are given in this article no concrete data; only 
the opinion that such types exist, based on the author’s 
experience in the codperative schools in the University 
of Cincinnati. We can hardly adopt it without more 
evidence. It is a characteristic of the writings of Dickens 
that he puts the people of his stories into sharp lights 
and deep shadows, so that we find in his books well- 
marked types which we do not find in real life. Dickens

saw and magnified the peculiarities of men. Such a 
habit of mind may prove delightful in a novelist, but 
it can hardly be of use to a vocational counselor. Per- 
haps Dean Schneider realizes this, for he says just be- 
fore his conclusion : 
I am of the opinion that for the present, vocational guid- 
ance can only point out in which types of occupations an 
individual will in all probability mot be successful. 
It is to be regretted that the authors of a new high- 
school textbook for life-career classes (Gowin and Wheat- 
ley) should have used and elaborated Schneider’s classi- 
fications. 
Another classification has been proposed by Pro- 
fessor Giddings, in a recent address at Teachers College, 
Columbia University : 
Does the child that you are watching begin to lead, to 
dictate, to suggest, to set examples, or does he show, from 
earliest years, that he is a born imitator, a copyist, a fol- 
lower? ... If you are a teacher, if you are a parent, if 
you are interested in the child, the sooner you discover to 
which of the classes your child belongs, the sooner you will 
be on the right track in guiding the further development of 
his character and his mind.1   “Born imitator,” we are told, and, “the sooner 
you can discover.” Thus we are not dealing with types 
of twenty-year-old minds, but with types determined 
before birth! The address contains little attempt at 
1 Giddings, p. 24.
-P-A-G-E-163
  
  PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 153 
evidence, the rhetoric being of the hortatory “ type” 
rather than the scientific. Moreover, nothing is said 
about accidental circumstances which determine, in- 
fluence, or alter a child’s behavior: what kind of parents 
has he to live with? has he older or younger brothers 
or sisters? is he equipped with educative toys? has he 
had early playmates, and were they older or younger? 
Neither is anything said about those children who may 
reside comfortably between these two “types” and 
show no marked tendencies to either extreme. 
No doubt we may find, if we divest ourselves of the 
mania to classify and find types, that a given child is 
“ directive” at one moment of the day, and meek at 
another; aggressive about his own toys, but submissive 
in strange surroundings; willing to lead in games he 
knows, and to follow in others. We can agree with 
Professor Giddings in his conclusions about the need 
of socializing the individual, but we can maintain that 
neither for that nor for the purposes of vocational 
guidance is it necessary to read into him a classification 
unfounded on facts. 
Another classification (Blumenthal)! is stated as 
follows : 
There are three types of school children : 
I. The coarse type. 
II. The fine type. 
III. The medium type. 
1 Central Committee, pp. 14-18. Puffer’s book is founded on the 
type idea, as also on an exaggeration of heredity; see pp. 59, 62, 83.  
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
The context suggests that the classification is to be 
undertaken when the child is four years of age. For 
every type there is a positive and a negative. No 
estimate of relative numbers belonging to the different 
types is given. After describing each type the author 
proceeds : 
Now after the teacher has classified the types, and any 
teacher of average intelligence can do this easily, he will be 
anxious to group the types according to their quality — their 
mental and physical standards. Grouping the types is very 
interesting work [sic]. For this some practical psychological 
knowledge is required. The easiest way for a beginner is 
to group his types in the following classes: 
1. Mentally strong and physically weak. 
2. Physically strong and mentally weak. 
3. Physically and mentally weak. 
4. Harmonious — mentally and physically well-balanced. 
5. Advanced or degenerate. 
Such a classification, presented without evidence, 
should, after what we have said above, furnish its own 
refutation. 
The notorious classification of persons into round 
pegs and square pegs has fortunately almost disappeared 
from the modern literature of vocational guidance. It 
is significant that the references to types of mind are 
diminishing in the literature of vocational guidance. Is 
it not now the time to abandon them altogether, as 
having no evidence in their support, as tending to crys- 
tallize the procedure of vocational guidance into a 
machine-like operation, and as helping to obscure the 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 155 
fact that every child is entitled to be treated so far as 
possible without reference to the characteristics of other 
children? 
Classifications should be known by the company they 
keep: it was the business of astrology, palmistry, and 
phrenology to pigeonhole into fixed classifications the 
individuals who applied to them. For the typical kinds 
of brains, as described in Fowler’s Phrenology, we are 
now asked to substitute typical kinds of minds — kinds 
that correspond more or less closely with the phre- 
nologist’s categories. 
Educational Implications of the Classifications. — The 
reason for attempting a classification is that we may 
subject the children in the two classes to different kinds 
of educational treatment. That this aim is a desirable 
one is shown by all the progressive efforts to differen- 
tiate courses for children — to take account of individ- 
ual differences, in the administration of the school and 
its program. For this work the child’s requirements 
must be studied. But there is neither need nor justi- 
fication for using fixed or questionable classifications in 
making this study. Individual differences in mental 
traits are rapidly being measured, and they approximate 
the normal distribution. The teacher needs neither to 
try to diminish nor to accentuate the deviation of any 
individual from the mean. He need only provide for 
the child’s development, adjusting the curriculum to 
his present requirements, and keeping the way open 
for a change of treatment at any time.

  I 56 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Overestimation of what Psychological Tests can at 
present Do. — Our second class of false guidance has to 
do with tests. We have already quoted Bloomfield and 
Ayres! regarding what these tests can do. Their state- 
ments, conservative as they are, seem to be too sanguine. 
Ayres? states as the substance of achievement up to 
October, 1913: 
At the present time we possess a rudimentary knowledge 
of the qualifications demanded in four occupations — those 
of inspector of bicycle balls, motorman, telephone operator, 
and typewriter. 
The evidence, even for this modest claim, is not very 
satisfactory. There is nothing to prove, for example, 
that testing the reaction time of the girls who sorted 
the bicycle balls was as good a test as would have been 
an actual trial at the exercise which that occupation 
demands.* The second and third sets of tests are drawn 
from Miinsterberg’s experiments.* Yet his experiments 
were designed to show a method rather than a result, 
and have never been adopted in commercial life. 
1 Chapter IV. 2 Nat. V. G. Assn., p. 36. 
* This bicycle-ball test is now abandoned, but the report of it promises 
to go on for an indefinite time echoing through the writings of those 
searching for help from psychology. So little does the science teach us 
yet, and so much are short cuts sought after ! 
4 Professor Miinsterberg’s tests are criticized in the article in The Un- 
popular Review (Breese), especially that for sea-captains. The test is 
not explicitly designed as an adequate method of selecting captains, yet 
each page of the chapter is headed “Ship Service.” This test has been 
won on speed alone. It is based on the naive assumption that accurate, 
quick judgment in sorting cards can measure good judgment in man- 
aging a ship !
-P-A-G-E-167
    PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 157 
The “ typewriting test ” is based on an experiment by 
Professor Lough.! His theory is that typewriting in- 
volves habit-formation; therefore as a test in habit 
formation sheets of paper are given out, each sheet 
containing rows of letters and bearing at the top a key 
in which each letter of the alphabet is represented by 
another letter as a symbol. This exercise is given as a 
test of speed in transcribing and learning the key, 
twenty tests in as many days, and it is assumed that 
the results will show who is fitted for the typewriting 
occupation and who is not. But this conclusion rests 
solely on this one experiment, whose results when cor- 
related with school marks in each of four studies, German, 
mathematics, typewriting, and business forms and 
stenography, show a high degree of positive relation 
with typewriting. He concludes that from such tests 
in habit-formation ‘‘ it would be possible to select those 
who are likely to succeed in typewriting, and to give a 
vocation to those who would not succeed.” Here is a 
curious compound fetitio principii. In the first place 
the tests are not measured against real success in the 
occupation of typewriting, but only against school courses 
in the subject. In the second place, the school marks 
in the classes in typewriting are used as the standard 
to validate the test, after which the test is to be used to 
supplant the school marks and provide a short-cut 
method of determining capability for the course and the 
occupation. If our previous conclusions are correct, 
1See Nat. Conference, pp. 89-96. 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  
  158 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
we must raise three serious objections to the method. 
First, habit-formation is but one of the mental elements 
in learning to typewrite, and perhaps not the most im- 
portant. There are spelling, neatness, common sense, 
and general education to be reckoned with. Second, 
certain moral qualities may enter in such a way as to 
upset completely conclusions based on such a test, — 
persistence, for example, may finally win out against 
great odds. Third, as we shall see in the next section, 
habit-formation cannot be regarded as a general quality, 
to be transferred at will from a substitution test to type- 
writing. 
The statement by Bloomfield may prove true — it 
may be that tests will aid a fifteen-year-old boy in choos- 
ing between professional, business, or mechanical study. 
So far, no tests have been adequate to prove or dis- 
prove the hypothesis. As Bloomfield says, tests can 
hardly show ability to influence men? and, as we have 
noted in another connection, they have not yet shown 
general improvability. 
The whole question of the danger in overestimation 
of what psychological tests can do, as well as the theory 
1 Professor Lough suggests the desirability of testing emotional 
control, but outlines no method. Added to the above strictures, this 
observation seems to have escaped the experimenter, — that some who 
study typewriting have no intention of making it their calling. It seems 
desirable that everybody should learn to typewrite at least as fast as 
he can write. Finally, one wonders whether twenty trials at typewrit- 
ing itself might not prove a better index of ability than those here used, 
if an index must be sought.

                of types, is discussed by Dr. H. D. Kitson, University 
of Chicago. His two articles form an excellent antidote 
for the conception we are combating. (See Bibliog- 
raphy.) He quotes approvingly Professor James’s ob- 
servation that, “ However closely psychical changes 
may conform to law, it is safe to say that individual 
histories and biographies will never be written in advance 
no matter how ‘evolved’ psychology may become.” 4 
Other recently written papers indicate that a saner 
view is being taken. In School and Society for June 26, 
1915,” Hollingworth discusses the various kinds of 
tests and concludes that Mrs. Woolley’s records may 
prove of value, but that others are open to question. 
He concludes : 
            
         It is essential that interest in this eminently practical 
use of the psychological laboratory be sustained among 
those who are responsible for the further promotion of its 
methods and problems. It is equally undesirable that 
public expectation should be strenuously directed toward 
the laboratory before it has done more than outline a series 
of problems and attempt a few trivial and preliminary efforts 
toward their solution. 
          
        
    
       In the issue of June 19, 1915, Hancock of the University 
of Cincinnati says that Dean Schneider and Professor 
Breese, after three years of experimental work, have 
       1 Principles of Psychology, Vol. Il, p. 576. 
2 Pp. 920, 922. Hollingworth’s book, Vocational Psychology, is helpful 
and conservative. However, one wonders whether there is yet any real 
body of vocational psychology.

so far been able to find no correlation between the results 
of the psychological tests and known abilities. 
Employers have been particularly credulous regard- 
ing psychological tests and gullible about actual chi- 
canery, but we find Richard A. Feiss, general manager, 
The Clothcraft Shops of the Joseph and Feiss Company, 
Cleveland, Ohio, saying that outside of such practical 
examinations as the color tests for railway engineers 
psychological tests will not aid materially in the problem 
of employing. 
There seems to be no reason for amending in any way 
Mrs. Woolley’s statement at the second conference that 
“an intelligent interest, extending over the early years 
of school life, ought to furnish a more adequate basis 
for judgment about the child’s future, than any set of 
laboratory tests could supply. Experimental psy- 
chology is, as yet, a coarse and clumsy tool, attacking 
a very difficult, delicate, complex problem.” ? 
Superintendent Thompson, speaking at the Rich- 
mond Convention, said :? 
The few scientific tests for vocational aptitudes that we 
now possess give us more of concern than of promise. . . . 
For the present, at least, the vocational counselor will ob- 
tain greatest advantage from the study of the general em- 
ployment situation of his community. . . . Common sense, 
broad sympathies, and knowledge of adolescent tendencies 
will prove of more worth to him than acquaintance with 
intricate psychological procedure. The practical methods

        PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 161 
to be at once adopted by vocational counselors are those 
which are obvious rather than obscure. 
The next thought in Superintendent Thompson’s 
paper, as quoted above, is one with which we may con- 
clude this section: that “the school records of pupils 
if properly kept and reasonably comprehensive furnish 
enough presumptive evidence upon which effective 
guidance can be tentatively based.” The psychologist 
may help vocational counsel best by aiding in the im- 
provement of the school examinations in the various sub- 
jects: the laboratory should be the schoolroom and the 
exercise the regular work of the class. And he may help 
civil service commissions and business establishments in 
devising standardized tests based on the actual work the 
employees will be called upon to do.* 
The Belief that Qualities of Mind are General and 
Transferable, rather than Specific. — Vocational guid- 
ance has still another score to settle with a pseudo- 
psychology, and this is the belief in the “ spread” or 
transfer of mental qualities. Can the attention of a boy be 
tested, so that the conclusion can be drawn that he is 
attentive or inattentive? Can a simple examination be 
devised to test the powers of observation? Can honesty 
in examinations qualify a girl for the label, “‘ honest girl”? 
In short, are such activities as attending, observing, con- 
1Scott’s “Salesmanship Test” tests pene icecernesch but has little 
relation to salesmanship. Seashore’s tests for musical ability are prof- 
itable as showing what may be done in fields requiring a high order of 
specialized ability. The testing carried on in the army proved its value 
as an emergency measure.

centrating, persisting, using energy, being fair, being 
honest, remembering, analyzing, etc., if applied to one 
situation, likely to be applicable to all? We are, of 
course, touching on the whole question of general train- 
ing or formal discipline. It is the belief in the general 
nature and transferability of mental and moral quali- 
ties that is at the bottom of the beliefs that we have 
just been examining: the beliefs in types and in the 
efficacy of laboratory tests. 
A glance at a few of the blanks used in vocational 
guidance will show how common is the assumption.! 
The doctrine of general training has recently been 
subjected to experimental tests, and while many psy- 
chologists hold that the data are not yet conclusive, few 
persons who have examined the modern literature of 
the subject can maintain seriously that mental qualities 
    are general enough in their nature to justify the educa- 
    tional practice of developing a quality in one department 
of life in order that it may spread to another one more 
desirable.2 Rather, the valid practice is to train specifi- 
cally for the particular quality desired. Thus, as has 
            
  been pointed out, the manual dexterity required to guide 
a bicycle is quite different from that needed by an en- 
Courage in facing a baseball pitcher is likely 
       graver.       
   1See Parsons, pp. 37-43, 104; Readings, p. 131; also references in 
Chapter IV. 
2 Following are some important references on the subject of general 
training: Moore, Chap. III (gives a historical sketch and a résumé 
of the argument against the theory); Pillsbury and others; Thorndike, 
Educational Psychology, Vol. 11; Heck; Bagley, Chap. XIII; Judd.        
         
-P-A-G-E-173
  
  PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 163 
to be entirely unrelated to that required in facing an 
audience. Even memory is now held to be specific: a 
good memory for athletic records does not of itself mean 
a good memory for poetry. Observant school people 
have always known that any pupil’s standards of truth- 
fulness, honesty, courtesy, kindness, good use of English, 
attention, and all the other virtues, vary with time and 
circumstance. Personal qualities are specific rather 
than general. The writer knows of a person who is 
deliberate in deciding to go to the theatre, but hasty 
in choosing what to eat; fond of both indoor and out- 
door work, with no preference for either; abstract in 
his religious thinking, and skillful with carpentry tools; 
inaccurate in arguments, but accurate at figures; care- 
less in handwriting, but careful in typewriting; de- 
pendent in buying clothes, but “ directive”? in buying 
books; observant of names, but very unobservant of 
faces; attentive to political arguments, but excessively 
inattentive to narrative and to music. , 
Is it not true that emotional elements, such as the 
desire for success, self-confidence, excitement, competi- 
tion, accidental associations which are stirred up, 
strangeness of the laboratory, —and so many others 
that nobody can estimate their number or influence, — 
are at all times hidden denials of our records in such 
tests as those for “ verbal memory,” “ auditory reten- 
tiveness,” “left-hand steadiness,” “ cancellation ac- 27 66 
curacy,” and “ index of fatigue ”’? 
Until we measure the index of fatigue in an actual

    164 | THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
football game, the hand steadiness in making something 
the child very much wants to make, the accuracy in 
throwing a ball, the verbal memory for sentences vital 
to the child, and the retentiveness for something the 
child wishes to retain, our laboratory measures cannot 
have very much psychological accuracy or general utility 
in school and shop. 
What substitute procedure can we follow? In the 
first place, we can select situations which illustrate 
human virtues, and we can then make a conscious effort 
to point out the ways in which these principles can be 
applied to other situations. Thus neatness in arith- 
metic papers gives certain benefits; such and such of 
these benefits hold true of papers in composition. In 
the second place, we may seek concrete situations, and, 
instead of asking a boy if he is honest, ask him what he 
would do under certain hypothetical circumstances, and 
why. In the third place, we ought to define “ effi- 
ciency” and “ success”? with our pupils, and should 
' strive to give them the habit of succeeding in repeated 
instances of socially useful tasks. Then, if we wish 
measured results, they should be computed on the basis 
of the success of the boy or girl in these tasks. 
What we need to do, in other words, is to cultivate 
desirable habits in every activity and relation of life, 
without depending on the transfer of qualities from one 
department of life to another.’ 
1 Artificial tests may yet discover short-cut methods of judging char- 
acter; the point here made is that they_must, for the present, be disre-
-P-A-G-E-175
    PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 165 
Overestimation of the Importance of Physical Char- 
acteristics. — The fourth kind of questionable guidance 
is based on an exaggeration of the importance of phys- 
ical qualities. Not only have we forgotten Plato’s true 
doctrine that a good body will not by its own excellence 
make the soul good,' but we have also grown into a 
materialistic centering of the thought on bodily charac- 
teristics. There are courses for business men in which 
blonds and brunettes, brown eyes and blue, aquiline 
faces, small lips, and tapering hands, are discussed in 
their vocational significance. It is supposed that em- 
ployment managers can by this means find short cuts 
to “ size up ” applicants and tell which to hire and which 
to reject. Current magazines are supplied with the 
advertisements of the people who furnish such informa- 
tion. A new book has recently appeared, in which is 
told how to analyze character and ability at first sight. 
The effect of these experiments goes deeper than mere 
loss of money and disappointment; it involves the in- 
justice of misjudging men. This teaching goes on in 
spite of the fact that not even criminals can be discovered 
by their faces; if they were, the work of detectives 
would be easier. Some men say they can tell whether 
or not a man is a good workman by the way he picks 
garded for vocational guidance, and they must free themselves of their 
dependence on the transfer theory. It is to be noted here that we are 
not discussing the subject of psychological tests for determining mental 
backwardness; the best of such tests are founded on specific items of 
knowledge.

up a hammer, and Fullerton tells about an employment 
manager who judges boys by whether or not they re- 
spond to certain arbitrary orders and mental sugges- 
tions he throws out.! 
The schools cannot codperate with employment man- 
agers who taint themselves with such doctrines. Yet 
who does not know a teacher or two who occasionally 
makes snap judgments, or “ sizes up” her pupils the 
first day? Even the counselor may sometimes be 
tempted to say: ‘“ This girl is too short to be a good 
teacher,” or, “ That boy is not strong, so he ought not 
to do indoor work.” No such statements have a place 
in vocational guidance. The physical requirements 
have not yet been standardized even for athletic 
events and professional baseball. Further, the physical 
examination, as such, can tell nothing about the 
person’s courage, perseverance, kindness, ability to 
coéperate, nor even much about his ability to gain in 
physique. 
The best way would be for the counselor to tell the 
requirements for the occupation, and to raise the ques- 
tion of physique, general health, or apparent defect 
as a problem likely to be met and therefore necessary 
to consider. Advice is appropriate; prophecy must be 
avoided. The person himself must decide. 
It is reported that some of the members of an occu- 
pational bureau in New York City are taking one of 
1See Bibliography. He offers no evidence that the psychological or 
other tests are valid.
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 167 
the courses given by a leading exponent of character 
analysis and vocation-determination-at-the-first-inter- 
view, their excuse being that while the theories and 
practices expounded in the course are very largely 
“rubbish,” nevertheless the teacher herself is a woman 
of great common sense and gives them some valuable 
information which they can use in their placement 
activities. This shows the dangers to which the vo- 
cational-guidance movement is exposed by those sup- 
posed to be its friends. Here are educated persons, 
who, instead of making painstaking study of the educa- 
tional, sociological, and economic aspects of their prob- 
lems, resort to admitted charlatanism for the purpose 
of finding ashort cut. Just at the time when more and 
more employers are making a scientific study of their 
problems and are abandoning rule of thumb on the one 
hand and mystic methods and guesswork on the other, 
these people are going back to methods no better than 
astrology and phrenology. What an assumption of 
superiority, besides, that they can separate the good 
from the evil! The movement for vocational guidance 
has had quite enough, already, of the method of mixing 
good and evil. It is time now for a separation between 
those who wish to study and learn and those who wish 
to juggle and dream. 
Regarding the sanguine beliefs in mystic short-cuts, — 
beliefs which die hard, — David Spence Hill, who ex- 
presses a particularly sane viewpoint on the difficulties 
and dangers besetting the vocational counselor, says
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
that we must ‘‘ know the individual by a method more 
sure than casual observation, phrenological chicanery, 
or physiognomic delusion.” ! 
Morbid Self-Examination. — The fifth error in some 
plans of vocational guidance, overemphasis of self- 
analysis, seems to be based on the theory that some- 
where in the world there is a niche for every person to 
fit into, and that misfits are those who fail to find their 
destined places. It is known now, however, that there 
are no such fixed niches, and that jobs need more analyz- 
ing and adjusting than do people. Boys and girls need 
a record of successful accomplishments in a variety 
of useful fields; this the schools of the near future will 
give them. A list of useful acts is as much better 
than a list of qualities as works are better than mere 
faith. 
That vocational guidance must free itself from those 
questions which overemphasize self-analysis must be 
evident through an examination of the blanks used in 
present practice (see references, pp. 106, 162). Ques-

printed blank: “Do you consider yourself absolutely 
honest?” “ What vices do you have to fight down in 
yourself?” ‘Are you stubborn?” “What are your 
limitations and defects?” Questions of this nature 
lead to statements like these two taken from the case- 
letter file of the Boston Vocation Bureau: “I always 
like to joke and to improve things.” ‘TI feel unrest, 
due to the conviction that I am cut out for something 
big and fine.” 
Self-analysis has the hypnotic effect of fastening on 
us the qualities we set down; to a great degree we have 
the qualities we think we have. This is illustrated in 
the paper on Self-Analysis by High School Girls! in 
which the girls chose their vocations partly on the basis 
of classifying themselves as “ thing-thinkers ” or “ idea- 
thinkers.” 
So far as may be discovered, no concrete evidence has 
been presented to prove that the young person’s analysis 
of himself is valid. We know that we adults encounter 
frequent surprises, both in ourselves and in others whom 
we know best, and that we can never be even approxi- 
mately sure of success in a new venture until we have 
made an actual trial. Yet we ask the fourteen-year- 
old boy to tell us his talents and characteristics and then 
to choose his vocation. Even adults cannot be trusted 
in self-analysis. In the words of Burns: 
“O wad some Pow’r the giftie gie us 
To see oursels as ithers see us!”

  I7o THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Three substitutes for detailed self-analysis may be 
tried. We may first obtain the question and rating 
sheets from business houses in the community, using 
these as a basis for showing the qualities demanded, and 
for suggesting that each person must prepare himself 
to meet the scrutiny of these questions. Second, we 
may arrange our school program, and the occupational 
experiences of persons entering upon work, so that each 
bad trait or defect, so far as is humanly possible, will 
be crowded out by the development of an appropriate 
good habit. Finally, we may adopt the plan of ob- 
taining composite opinions of teachers and others in- 
terested in the child, as suggested in Chapter IV. 
These opinions are built up out of the special qualities 
the child has shown in the varied work and play of the 
efficient school, and they will no doubt prove a far 
better index of the character of the child than will his 
own self-analysis. 
Overguidance. — Two high school teachers, both col- 
lege graduates, went out of their way to “ take an in- 
terest in” and advise a certain pupil, and both of them 
told him that on account of various limitations it was 
useless for him to think of going to college. He had 
already made himself an expert salesman, working 
afternoons and Saturdays in a large clothing store, was 
an excellent student, and was a leader in the affairs 
of the high school. Here was an obvious case of gratui- 
tous and erroneous advice. The boy did well in college 
studies, serving as assistant in economics, and is now

studying in a graduate school and trying to decide 
between law, teaching, and business. Naturally he 
does not remember kindly the attempted guidance these 
teachers gave him. 
Overguidance may be either positive or negative. 
Though perhaps the attempt deliberately to discourage 
a student’s choice is the more common kind, yet fre- 
quently cases occur in which the counselor is tempted 
to be sanguine, or too sure in the advice which he has 
given. Thus, Parsons’ cases’ sometimes show more 
confidence than seems warranted. 
Overguidance is frequently implicitly advocated by 
writers who apparently have not weighed the conse- 
quences of what they are saying. The following quo- 
tation, for example, makes it appear that the children 
are permanently stamped with distinct qualities, and 
that they should, like so many pawns, be put once and 
for all into their places: 
A guidance bureau should be like a type-distributing 
machine, which will take a hopperful of type, of all the letters 
of the alphabet, and place each in its particular niche, in the 
one place of all places where it fits.? 
The way to avoid overdirective influence is indi- 
cated in much that has been said in preceding pages. 
Kitson speaks for the “ monitory type ” of vocational 
guidance which states facts and frees itself both from 
intuition without knowledge, and zeal beyond the evi- 
dence.

Commercial Agencies. — Probably no person other 
than one receiving pay from the applicant would ever 
say, “ This is your vocation.” Such an agent is bound 
to produce something tangible at the first interview, in 
order that he may send the applicant away feeling 
that the visit has been worth money. The honest 
counselor cannot at the first interview produce final 
results for a stranger. Hence arises the need for pro- 
tecting the public by having all the guidance done under 
public auspices, or by agents responsible to boards of 
well-known and trusted directors. 
As has been noted in an earlier chapter, children 
often get their ideas of guidance from newspaper ad- 
vertisements, and are often induced to read and use 
material which is worse than trash. 
If vocational guidance will free itself from all ex- 
travagant claims, and from the use of methods not yet 
valid — for on these claims and methods the commercial 
agent thrives — there will be little chance for the coun- 
selor who charges a fee to deceive the public. The school 
courses in vocations should touch on this kind of “ guid- 
ance,” so that young people may be forewarned. 
Lack of Social Perspective. — ‘‘ The Efficient Opti- 
mist,” is the title of a recent magazine article ! which 
commences as follows : 
The first idea to be drilled into the mind, heart, soul, and 
body of every human being is the firm assurance: 
“Vou can!” 
1 Purington, The Independent, Nov. 22, 1915, Pp. 300.    
-P-A-G-E-183
  PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 173 
This advice is of the sort so often given to young 
people, couched in such expressions as, “ develop per- 
sonal efficiency,” “ be a leader,” “ strengthen your will- 
pass get the success-habit,” 
“be a director, not a follower,” “ manage men,” “ you power, 66 never admit failure, 
may be the kind of steel that is made into rails for people 
to run over, or you may make yourself into a watch- 
spring and run the whole works! ” 
Many of these ideals+ appear to put success before 
righteousness ; they base success on power to do things, 
without first determining whether or not the things 
are worth doing at all. What is there in human will 
power, that we should so urge our young people to cul- 
tivate it? Is a strong will, per se, a desirable quality? 
These questions cannot be answered here, but they are 
worth better consideration than the efficiency experts have 
given them. Will power is necessary, no doubt, in all 
worthy undertakings ; but it has also been at the bottom 
of nearly every act of murder, lust, and unrighteous war. 
Will power needs the check of education, conscience, 
and social aim.? 
1It is true that the author of our first quotation includes in his test 
sheet the question, Is your final ambition unselfish? But this is not 
enough. The writer knows of a gentleman whose final ambition is to 
help the cause of prohibition. While waiting for a “more convenient 
season” he is engaged in some questionable real-estate speculation, and 
occasionally patronizes the liquor business. 
2 An interesting study in this connection is based on the question, 
Is the use of the will more necessary in selfish or in unselfish undertak- 
ings? Compare, for example, the works of Jesus or Socrates with those 
of Alexander or Napoleon. The answer is not far to seek, — “Not 
my will, but thine, be done.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Mere material success cannot be the goal of vocational 
guidance: moral guidance must accompany vocational. 
Another kind of guidance which shows a lack of social 
perspective is that in which the boy or girl is repressed 
and his individuality subordinated to the will of another. 
It is to be noted that the motto “I can” means for 
multitudes “I cannot.’ Mere personal efficiency, as 
we shall see in a later place (Chap. VII), is likely to 
benefit the few at the expense of the many. The 
acceleration of the competitive struggle means many 
tragic failures but only a few spectacular “ successes.” 
Both kinds of error, unless checked by our educational 
programs, will only aggravate the hatred between the 
classes, and add to a problem already very acute in 
America. 
The unsocial doctrines to which young men are exposed 
is well shown by the questionable methods being taught 
in salesmanship. For example, a widely circulated book, 
Influencing Men in Business, The Psychology of Argu- 
ment and Suggestion (Scott), is dedicated “‘ to the young 
business man . . . who is studying to make his argu- 
ments more convincing and his suggestions more coer- 
cive.” The book teaches that suggestion has greater 
influence than argument, and that suggestion excludes 
comparison and criticism (p. 147). The author shows 
how suggestive questions may be used to force a cus- 
tomer to decide to buy, and states that such methods 
“ when properly used . . . are most effective ” (p. 168). 
The book concludes :
-P-A-G-E-185
    PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 175 
Tf in persuading men we wish to depend upon the working 
of suggestion we must relieve them, so far as possible, of the 
distressing necessity of deciding, and we must also relieve 
them of all difficulty in the steps necessary to carry out that 
which we have been trying to suggest they should do. The 
man who is able to relieve his prospects in these two parti- 
culars is the man skilled in carrying his suggestions to a happy 
conclusion. [P. 168.] 
It would seem that if such doctrines are to be taught 
under the name of salesmanship, courses in “‘ buyman- 
ship ” should be taught as an antidote and protection. 
At any rate, the vocational counselor can do nothing 
but condemn such a dangerous attempt at vocational 
“ efficiency.” 
Control of Vocational Guidance by Other Agencies. — 
What is of greater importance than the “ vocational 
guidance of youth?” Is it the granting of work cer- 
tificates; the enforcement on truants of the compulsory 
education law; the placement of children who are un- 
fortunate enough to have to leave school; the securing 
by business men of adequate help; the promotion of 
vocational education; psychological research in the 
schools ? 
That vocational guidance, like many another move- 
ment, needs to be protected from its supposed friends, 
is shown by a statement by Healy in his book The 
Individual Delinquent1 He is discussing the difficulty 
involved in inducing the children to come to his labora- 
Pp. 47-48. 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  176 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
tory to be examined for possible deficiencies, and states 
that a good plan is to tell them that they are to be 
examined for their vocational abilities, ‘‘ which indeed 
they are.” He continues that the examination may 
begin with vocational questions, and may then gradually 
lead into the mental and medical fields. If this sort 
of thing goes on, vocational guidance will not only lose 
its identity; it will take on all the associations of patho- 
logical psychology, and will be thought fitting for only 
those who “have something the matter with them.” 
Cannot those genuinely interested in vocational guidance 
issue an injunction against such practices? 
Probably it will be admitted that nothing less than 
the problem of education considered as a whole is of 
greater importance than vocational guidance. If this 
be true, then its work should not be directed by any 
other subordinate department. Vocational guidance 
must be controlled by the main organization for educa- 
tion, the school committee or board, through the super- 
intendent and his assistants, but it should not be con- 
trolled by any lesser power. For the same reason that 
associations of business men should not control the 
vocation bureau, neither the work-certificate office nor 
the placement bureau should control it. 
Vocational guidance must develop its own point of 
view. Its problem is at best a very complex and diffi- 
cult one. It must not be hampered by having to see 
its problems through the eyes of an office with a dif- 
ferent purpose.   
      
   
-P-A-G-E-187
  PSEUDO-GUIDANCE 177 
Conclusion. — No errors are eradicated by merely 
fixing the attention on them without turning the effort 
into the right channels. The errors must, however, be 
recognized, and then denied opportunity for operation. 
Genuine and systematic study of the complex problems 
of vocational guidance, no matter on how small a scale, 
is more to be desired than attempts to find by-paths and 
short-cuts. Mystical and futile activities should be 
abandoned and energy directed into improving the school 
environment of the child, studying the occupations, 
or other legitimate efforts, if real and permanent prog- 
ress is to be made. 
One of the most necessary activities for the teacher- 
guide is the study of occupations, for of them he will 
ordinarily have had least experience. Our inquiry will 
therefore proceed into that field. The next two chapters 
will deal with the conditions under which young people 
enter work and the problems of employment, together 
with some economic and social aspects of vocational 
guidance.

  CHAPTER VI 
THE Younc WorKER 
“At least two million boys and girls in this country 
between the ages of fourteen and sixteen are working 
for wages. They are unskilled at that age and unable 
to take responsibility. Few occupations open to them 
offer any training that enables them to develop. 
“This does not include the additional army of chil- 
dren in some of the Southern States leaving school at 
the tender age of twelve. During the present year at 
least a million more childish wage-earners upon reaching 
the age of fourteen will enter the ranks of industry. 
More than six out of ten of this multitude did not finish 
the work of the elementary school. More than three 
out of four of them did not reach the seventh year of the 
schools and more than one out of two, the sixth. Almost 
half of them had not completed the fifth grade work. 
Great numbers of them were barely able to meet the test 
for illiteracy necessary in order to secure working cer- 
tificates, which in most of the States is a test on the work 
of the fourth grade.! 
This quotation, based as it is on census reports and 
on trustworthy studies of elimination from the public 
schools, suggests the subject matter of the present 
chapter. We are concerned with five questions : (1) Why 
1 Bulletin of Nat. Soc. for Prom. of Ind. Educ.

-P-A-G-E-189
  
  THE YOUNG WORKER 179 
do children leave school? (2) How do they obtain 
work? (3) What kind of work do they do? (4) What 
are the opportunities offered by their work? (5) What 
proposals have been made to remedy existing evils? 
That these problems are important is attested by the 
fact that scarcely a legislative session in any state fails to 
grapple with one or more of them. They are the burden of 
two important bills recently passed by the national Con- 
gress, the bill for federal aid to industrial education, and 
that to prohibit interstate commerce in child-made goods. 
Why do Children leave School? — Two industrial 
surveys! of recent date present tables showing the 
reasons given for leaving school :

At the second national conference on vocational 
guidance Miss Colleton of Boston stated (p. 156) that 
about one third of those leaving school needed to 
for financial reasons, but that another third left because 
they or their parents were dissatisfied with. the work 
of the school. Mrs. Woolley at the same meeting de- 
clared (p. 30) that every investigation of economic 
need among families of working children, except one in 
the stockyard district of Chicago, has shown that three 
fourths or more of the families do not absolutely need 
the earnings of the children under sixteen years of age. 
She states that the chief factor in sending children to 
work is their own desire to go, and that the chief reason 
for this desire is retardation in the school.

  THE YOUNG WORKER 181 
Children leave school, it appears from these studies, 
largely because the school fails to attract them. They 
leave “‘ to go to work,” sometimes pressed by economic 
need, it is true, but more often because to quit school 
for going to work seems to be the ordinary, expected 
thing todo. Three remedies suggest themselves: better 
school program and methods, scholarships to help needy 
children, and part-time work. These plans we shall 
discuss later. 
To the question, Does industry need the labor of 
children? a rapidly increasing multitude of testi- 
monies answer, No. It is true that in Southern cotton 
mills, where child labor has always been taken for 
granted, many owners still feel that their businesses 
cannot run without the ten-hour day of the loom tenders ; 
and that an occasional factory manager in other parts 
of the country asks the schools to place with him what 
he calls the “ product ” of the schools — those who leave 
at fourteen. But these conditions are not typical; and 
there seems no good reason to amend the statement 
resulting from the investigation of the University of 
Chicago Settlement : 
Aside from parasitic industries, there is no economic 
necessity for juvenile labor, according to the testimony of 
employers.1 
An Iowa investigation led to a similar conclusion.” 
Meanwhile, one state, Minnesota, by a gradual process

extending over ten years, has raised the school age for 
all children to the sixteenth birthday. 
How do Children Obtain Work? — The settlement 
workers of the United States say that girls should not 
be required to go about our cities looking for work. 
Yet in Boston 56 per cent of those girls between fourteen 
and sixteen who secured work applied in person. The 
complete table, taken from the same report referred to

If there were jobs enough so that the children could 
choose something which would lead them to their voca- 
tion, we should have no quarrel with what is told by 
the above table. We know, however, that with many 
of these children the mere chance of falling into one 
place rather than another, determines for them the kind 
1 Woods and Kennedy, pp. 17-18. 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
         THE YOUNG WORKER 183 
of work they follow for years to come. The job chooses 
the vocation. The Richmond Survey! discloses the 
fact that continued work in their jobs does not entirely 
reconcile them to their places, for from three to seven 
out of every ten of the young men and women at work 
wish to change to different occupations. 
We have been considering the children from fourteen 
to sixteen. How do the young men and women obtain 
their places? Certainly in no better ways than do those 
of younger years. The writer knows of a boy of good 
scholarship who made thirty futile applications for work 
during the two or three days after his graduation from 
high school. He would have taken almost any place 
offered, regardless of any choice of vocation he had 
made. In other words, the accidental “‘ boy wanted ” 
would have determined his occupation, for several years, 
at least. Bloomfield’s New York study shows that 
boys tell each other about places vacant. Mr. Lord’s 
study ? disclosed the same accidental choices. 
It appears, then, that better ways of getting work are 
needed, and that the school must do what it can to take 
the matter out of the realm of chance. The vocational 
counselor must interest himself in placement. What 
methods may be used we shall discuss in Chapter VIII. 
What Kind of Employment does the Young Worker 
Obtain? —In the 1915 report of the Committee on

alley jobs. They are not allowed to work with ma-

   It is to be remembered that these figures include full- 
time workers, but do not enumerate the army of part-

in Vocational and Moral Guidance, p. 155. What kind of work is done is 
of more importance than in what kind of an establishment the child 
works.

-P-A-G-E-195
  THE YOUNG WORKER 185 
The kind of work open to children in England was 
made the basis of the report on the poor laws from which 
Bloomfield quotes in Youth, School, and Vocation. It 
was found that only 18 per cent of the boys went defi- 
nitely into trades. The rest were errand boys, chore 
boys, and the like. 
All elementary school children and their parents should 
know about the Chicago investigations reported by Miss 
Davis at the Richmond meeting. Some of the findings 
are stated as follows: 
It has been found that there are very few positions which 
offer even a little training to children under sixteen years; 
that usually the only skill required in any work is speed; 
that many employers do not want children under sixteen 
years of age because the law permits them to work only eight 
hours a day, and because they are so small and unreliable, 
that it is not worth while to bother with them; that some 
employers in the very unskilled work prefer children of 
fourteen because their fingers are more flexible and they can 
work faster (p. 52). 
Bloomfield defines a blind alley as an employment 
whose possibilities for advancement are exhausted in 
a short time; an occupation or method of carrying on 
an occupation in such a way that there is no progress 
in the direction of increased intelligence and physical 
development. One of the most common blind alleys for 
bright boys is the position as errand boy in a high-class 
establishment such as a broker’s office or an engineer’s 
1Pp. 9-13. 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
  186 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
laboratory. The higher occupations in such businesses 
require extensive training, and there is absolutely no 
ladder reaching up to them from the place of the errand 
boy, mail boy, or elevator operator. This fact the boy 
finds out after two to four years’ work with some few 
minor promotions, and leaves the place to begin all over 
again. 
Miss Colleton outlines the work open to elementary 
school girls in Boston as follows: 
There was little or no difference in the occupations open 
to the girls who graduated and those who left before graduat- 
ing. The principal places open to them were in the depart- 
ment stores as bundle girls at $2.50 to $3.50; in the factories 
at $3 to $4; in stores as salesgirls at $5; in tailors’ shops at 
$2.50 to $3.50. 
Neither the Richmond nor the Minneapolis Survey 
is concerned primarily with the occupations of the 
young worker. Our comment from the Richmond 
Survey, showing the dissatisfaction among the older 
brothers and sisters at work, indicates that our former 
conclusions were correct: the child of fourteen is fitted 
neither by his own perspective nor by the opportunities 
open to him to choose his vocation. It is the manifest 
duty of the schools, therefore, to supervise the employ- 
ment of those children who are forced to work, so that 
they may be given the necessary facilities for making 
a wise choice of vocation, preparation for that occupa- 
tion through continuation-school opportunity, and some

element of guarantee that they will find work when the 
time comes for them to change to the better employment. 
Opportunites offered by Children’s Work. — Children 
are subjected to all the difficulties characteristic of em- 
ployment in general, which we shall outline in the next 
chapter. But added to these are certain special prob- 
lems which we shall discuss here. If there be need for 
improving the conditions of adult employment, much 
more is it the duty of society to supervise and improve, 
or abolish, child labor. 
Miss Davis, of Chicago, from whom we have quoted, 
continues : 
Reports have shown that much of the work open to chil- 
dren under sixteen is seasonal; that the children under six- 
teen are nearly always the ones who are laid off; that the 
average child works about one half the time during the two 
years between fourteen and sixteen, and that the average 
wage is not more than two dollars a week. [Less than four 
dollars while at work.] For this paltry sum these children 
are giving up their right to schooltime and playtime, their 
right to education and training (p. 52). 
The Wisconsin bulletin makes these comments about 
continuation school girls and boys: 
Here in Wisconsin we have a group of about 4000 girls 
with an average age of fifteen years, in fairly good health, earn- 
ing approximately an average wage of a little more than $3.00 
per week, working either constantly standing or constantly 
sitting, for forty-eight hours per week, and the majority of 
them live over a mile from their work, to which they walk. 
They are employed in candy making, canning and bottling,
-P-A-G-E-198
  188 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
hand finishing and sewing for tailors and knitters, spinning, 
spooling, and winding, machine knitting, taping, net weav- 
ing, turning gloves and linings, pasting and labeling, cash 
and messenger service, etc., etc... . 
Can we say that they are engaged in a recognized, profit- 
able employment? Can we say that they have made a 
choice of occupation? Can we say that they wish to increase 
their efficiency in their chosen occupation? .. . 
What shall we do with the boys under sixteen who enroll 
in the Continuation School? Take 4000 of these boys for 
consideration in Wisconsin. Their average age is fifteen years. 
They .. . earn on an average a little more than $4.00 per 
week, and many walk or ride long distances to work. They 
are employed in making shoes, as messenger and delivery 
boys, office and errand boys, time keepers, helpers, sorting 
and assembling, packing and wrapping, folding and filing, 
tending, and such simple tasks generally. The educational 
value of their work is very little, if any at all. They shift 
often from one job to another job, and quite as often from 
one occupation to another occupation. ... 
It must be said that these boys in general are not in a 
recognized profitable employment, that they have not already 
determined their aim to remain in and become efficient in 
any employment, and that, therefore, general improvement 
instruction may not wholly miss the mark in serving the 
group as a whole (pp. 479-480). 
The Pennsylvania continuation school law is reviewed 
by the chairman of the Committee on Industrial Edu- 
cation, National Association of Manufacturers, referred 
to (p. 189), who makes the following statement : 
Heretofore, many children under sixteen worked ten hours 
a day, and fifty-eight hours a week. Hereafter, they can 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  
  THE YOUNG WORKER 189 
work only a total of fifty-one hours a week, including the 
eight hours spent in school, and the maximum may not 
exceed nine hours in any one day. This last requirement 
has caused rather bitter complaint, in a few places, where 
it seemed necessary to work the children either ten hours 
or not at all, on the ground that some processes now carried 
on by children require attention constantly so long as the 
mill runs (p. 28). 
The quotation is followed by some plans which are being 
worked out to make necessary adjustments. 
The Boston Continuation School Bulletin, already 
quoted, gives a table (p. 24) from which it appears that 
both boys and girls enter upon employment at an average 
wage slightly below four dollars. 
Significant regarding the difficulty of obtaining work 
is the fact that 19 per cent of the boys and 39 per cent 
of the girls in the Boston Continuation School (besides 
the piece workers) obtained promise of work and their 
employment certificates without knowing what their 
wages were to be. 
Another source of dissatisfaction in the occupations 
lies in the fact that there is frequently no definite agree- 
ment as to the character of the work to be done. It is 
human nature for the employer to picture conditions 
in his establishment as attractively as possible, and for 
the boy or girl to make as good an appearance as he can. 
1 Wage figures, of course, were taken before the war increases of 1916 
and later. Present wages, and post-war adjustments, will show about 
the same relation to the cost of living as do these 1914-1915 figures to 
costs at that time.
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  190 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
When work actually begins, however, difficulties and 
misunderstandings are common. The younger members 
of the force must stand ready to run errands for every- 
body. The writer well remembers how often the work 
plans in his grocery-store experience were interrupted, 
and how he was made fun of because he remarked that 
he wanted a chance to do his “ regular work.” 
The boy or girl who asks for employment brings letters 
or gives references and fills out an application blank ; 
should not the employer at least be able to show the 
candidate the specifications of the job? It should not 
be difficult to tell a boy, in writing, from whom he is to 
take orders, how far his errands will carry him, what is 
the latest hour he will reach home, what special tasks he is 
likely to be assigned, just what he will have to do to 
obtain promotion, and what kind of clothes he is ex- 
pected to wear, any more than to tell him what his 
regular hours are and how long he will be allowed for 
lunch. 
In what manner shall the young worker be taught 
how to perform his duties? Here is a virgin field for 
investigation and constructive suggestion. Many em- 
ployers think that the success or failure of a boy is wholly 
an individual problem; they do not make it a practice 
to work out a system of supervision and follow-up. 
This lack of thoughtful care and helpful suggestion is 
another cause of difficulty. It often leads to sudden 
discharge or voluntary leaving without any previous 
intimation that dissatisfaction existed.
-P-A-G-E-201
    
THE YOUNG WORKER Igt 
The frequent change of employment is another symp- 
tom of an erroneous condition of the youth’s working 
experience. Those who know best about the matter es- 
timate that the average boy of fourteen to sixteen changes 
jobs from four to six times annually. Boys want to 
work up, and they are always dreaming that a change 
will improve the conditions under which they chafe. 
Since they have no assurance that a job will turn out well, 
however, under the present chaotic state of employment, 
the plan of trial and error is the only way open to them. 
The reasons for leaving positions given by the Boston 
Continuation School children (p. 25 of circular) are 
particularly instructive:

Shifting from job to job is a contributing cause to 
unemployment among children, but by no means the 
1 Figures are for the year ending March 31, 1915; the beginning of 
the war may have increased the number of discharges. The circular 
states that the Boston Continuation School seemed to have a steadying 
influence, — 950 pupils had worked in but one place since entering school, 
138 in two, and 47 in three or more. Few/of these children, of course, 
had been a full year in the school.
-P-A-G-E-202

only cause; the work is unsteady and seasonal, and the 
youthful efforts crude and inefficient. Some employers 
make it a practice to engage new hands frequently, 
discharging them when they grow experienced and wish 
more pay. Others refuse to break in raw material, 
but take those trained by other firms. 
The Wisconsin Outlines of Lessons, quoted above, 
has this to say about conditions in that state: 
The people who have dreams that these permit girls should 
have trade extension courses exclusively, get a shock when 
they learn that out of the 4000 girls, 500 hold the same job 
less than one month, tooo hold the job less than three months, 
tooo less than one year, and that barely 25 hold the job for 
two years (p. 479). 
Bloomfield prints a table from an investigation by the 
Henry Street Settlement, showing the ten jobs held by a 
girl from her fourteenth to her sixteenth years. 
A certain middle-sized New England factory city is 
said to have more sixteen- to eighteen-year-old boys 
walking its streets or in its billiard halls than has the 
city of Boston. These boys have been attracted into 
the mills at fourteen, have found themselves no better 
off after two to four years of work, have then quit the 
mill, and are now without an occupation and with prep- 
aration for none. 
“ Stumbling from one job to another,” “ job jungle,” 
“vocational anarchy,” and “ job hoboes,”’ seem to be 
terms of description which are justified by the facts. 0 66

THE YOUNG WORKER 193 
It should be remembered that we have not taken illus- 
trations from unfavorable places in this country, but 
from states so progressive that continuation schools 
have been organized to save the wastage. 
The schools cannot escape responsibility. A recent 
speaker states that Boston schools are training not more 
than 1500 students for industrial careers and approxi- 
mately 5000 for commercial, in spite of the fact that in- 
dustrial opportunities are twice as numerous. The 
school must recast its program of studies, it must give 
better guidance in the choice of occupation, and it must 
supervise employment. 
What Proposals have been Made to Remedy Existing 
Evils ? — There is no single specific which will cure these 
evils; developments in the past show the methods for 
the future, and promise continuous improvement. 
What has so far been done to make conditions for the 
young workers better has been the result of codperative 
intelligence, expressed in the sincere effort of teachers, 
workers, and employers. The continuation school, pre- 
vocational work, and the part-time plan, as well as many 
things in the differentiated and enriched school pro- 
gram, have resulted from this effort. Labor unions, 
manufacturers’ associations, and philanthropic organi- 
zations have joined the forces of education and the au- 
thority of the state in the work of reform.1 So much

economic interest; this is to be reckoned with but is not inevitable. The 
oO
-P-A-G-E-204
194 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
  has been accomplished that there is little doubt as to 
the future: ten years will beyond all question witness 
tremendous strides. 
We are concerned here with the lines of activity taken 
by present effort at reform,— with the proposals for 
improving the plight of the young worker. 
Let us first remind the reader that placement! (see 
Chapter IV) is not a satisfactory solution, as is plainly 
shown by both England’s experience and our own. 
Indeed, placement of children under sixteen — some day 
we may say eighteen — often aggravates the evil con- 
ditions. At any rate let us see if other proposals will 
not yield better fruit. 
Many of the plans for improvement have been touched 
upon in previous chapters. Thus employment super- 
vision, with school people guiding the working child, 
would go far to ma the young worker to make a success 
of his present job, to study his abilities and oppor- 
tunities, to make a wise choice of vocation, to take 
steps for definite preparation, and to find work in the 
chosen occupation when ready for it. The continuation 
school can do much to save the young worker for better 
employment. In the Wisconsin Outlines of Lessons 
Hicks ieee training the boys and girls for certain 
standard occupations while they are in the continuation 
school : 
point is that coéperation did the work, and that it would not have been 
done so well and so permanently without that codperation. 
1See Mrs. Woolley’s statements on placement, Second Conference, 
Pp: 29.
-P-A-G-E-205
    THE YOUNG WORKER 195 
The girls, outside of home-making, have at least seven 
constant occupations for which they may be safely trained, 
viz., servants, dressmakers, teachers, saleswomen, laundresses, 
nurses, housekeepers, while with the boys there are twenty 
or more constant occupations for which they may be safely 
trained, viz., laborers, retail merchants, clerks, draymen, 
salesmen, carpenters, steam railroad men, machinists, paint- 
ers, bookkeepers, waiters, engineers, printers, blacksmiths, 
masons, barbers, plumbers, street railroad men, shoemakers, 
bakers (p. 481). 
Not only may the continuation school direct the atten- 
tion of the young worker to these occupations, but the 
regular school as well, in the lower grades, may warn 
the pupils that those expecting to go to work early 
should choose an occupation beyond the errand-boy 
stage, and should consciously and persistently work 
toward that occupation. Indeed, the plan we suggested 
in another place, to have every pupil study several 
possible occupations, would aid the young worker to 
get into a better place. Moreover, merchants who use 
children under sixteen years of age must be taught 
the duty of providing for the future of their charges, 
either by offering opportunity for adequate promotion 
to the higher places within their establishments, or by 
their willingness to allow the child to leave their employ 
whenever he can better himself. The job should be 
recognized as temporary —a mere stepping-stone to a 
better employment. 
Other plans have been carried out or proposed. In 
Chicago the Vocation Bureau sent letters to parents,
-P-A-G-E-206
CNS Coe ee ae 
196 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
embodying the facts presented above and inviting the 
parents to conferences. 
In most cities some effort has been made by private 
organizations to provide scholarships for worthy children. 
The Second National Conference on Vocational Guidance 
devoted a session to Scholarships. It is unthinkable 
that aid to students should be confined to colleges and 
universities, or that it should be restricted to the brighter 
pupils, who need it least. 
open blind alleys — to organize industry so that every 
job for the young worker will lead to a better one. This 
plan involves employment supervision of a highly de- 
veloped sort, besides a recasting of the plan of opera- 
tion of many establishments, and a new form of codpera- 
tion between different forms of businesses. Thus the 
errand boy in a publishing house, if unqualified by po- 
tential ability to prepare for a position in the publishing 
business, must be directed perhaps into learning a trade 
so that he may be equipped to enter a shop at the age of 
eighteen or twenty. We are aware of the difficulties 
involved in such a plan, — the adjustments of wages, 
time, schedule of work in the establishment of present 
employment and in the school, problems of advice and 
guidance, and the possible changes of plans during any 
period of the process. Yet the principle involved here 
is exactly that of the continuation school, and the con- 
tinuation school, heralded at first as a fad and an im- Another proposal is that a systematic effort be made to

possibility, has won its way to the approval of all con- 
cerned. Part-time schooling has arrived: there re- 
mains only the problem of widening the opportunity it 
offers and of applying it to more workers. 
The part-time experiment has proved successful for 
colleges and high schools ; why not for elementary schools, 
is the argument, in case children find it necessary to earn 
money? If children are to be the errand runners of 
industry and commerce, why not have them work in 
two shifts, one from eight to twelve in the morning, 
and the other from one to five in the afternoon? If 
their employment were well supervised, their school- 
ing full of life and play, and their vocational guidance 
adequate, there seems no reason to suppose that harm 
would result to themselves or to society from their 
employment. The half day at work and half day at 
school would without doubt be better than the plan of 
alternate weeks, and children’s work is so simple that 
not even the pairing system! would be necessary for 
planning the work in the employing establishments. 
Some such plan as the above is mentioned in the 
Minneapolis Survey as having been suggested to the 
committee, but is not included in the recommenda- 
tions of the Survey Committee? Snedden states that 
the plan of having children work in two shifts of five 
hours each would probably be less disturbing to busi- 
ness than the present continuation school plan. Thum

-P-A-G-E-208
198 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
  has proposed a plan for part-time in public employment 
and in high school study. 
Before much can be done to reéducate the boys and 
girls at work, public opinion must be stirred to the 
necessity for this important piece of conservation. If 
school people, aided by progressive employers of labor, 
will continue and extend the experiments now under 
way, acceptable plans will shortly be developed. Vol- 
unteer effort in all the methods we have touched on — 
supervision of the working child, prevocational and 
vocational training in the continuation school, scholar- 
ships to keep children in school, opening the blind 
alleys, and half-day work — will provide data for per- 
missive legislation. Indeed, the stage of permissive 
legislation for continuation schools already has been 
passed in some states, and the next few years will un- 
doubtedly lead many of the states to make sweeping 
improvements in the conditions surrounding boys and 
girls at work.

  CHAPTER VII 
THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 
Our purpose in this chapter is to outline the bearing 
of certain unsolved problems of employment on voca- 
tional guidance. Obviously, our worker, at whatever 
age he begins work, and under whatever circumstances, 
must be equipped in at least three ways: (1) He must 
be efficient in his task, (2) He must be imbued with the 
desire and ability to improve his methods of work and 
to find development in his vocation, and (3) He must 
understand something of the economic and social signifi- 
cance of the main problems of employment. It is the 
third of these fields that we shall explore in this chapter ; 
and we shall assume that the vocational counselor must 
know something of these problems before he can be 
effective in aiding boys and girls to choose and prepare 
for commercial or industrial careers. 
Our study will have three main divisions : (1) the prob- 
lems as seen by the employer; (2) the worker’s stand- 
point; and (3) the signs of improvement in employ- 
ment conditions. 
The Problems of the Employer. Scientific Manage- 
ment. — The sharpness of modern competition has led 
to studies of management, with the result that Frederick 
199
-P-A-G-E-210
  200 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
W. Taylor worked out a comprehensive system of shop 
operation called scientific management. The boy or 
girl who goes into any large establishment may find 
himself under this system, and those who work for small 
businesses or go into business or manufacture for them- 
selves will of necessity be influenced by some of the many 
recent ramifications of the movement. We shall here 
deal first with the aims and methods of scientific manage- 
ment and next with the more general question of per- 
sonal and social efficiency. In discussing the short- 
comings of the methods so far used, we shall not forget 
the importance to vocational guidance of the movement 
for efficiency, and that the counselor must have his 
part in furthering it. 
What is Scientific Management?! Taylor states its 
aim and general method as follows: 
The principal object of management should be to secure 
the maximum prosperity for the employer, coupled with the 
maximum prosperity for each employee. . . . 
. . . the development of every branch of the business to 
its highest state of excellence, so that the prosperity may be 
permanent. 
. . . the development of each man to his state of maximum 
efficiency, so that he may be able to do, generally speaking, 
the highest grade of work for which his natural abilities fit 
him, and . . . giving him, when possible, this class of work 
to do (The Principles of Scientific Management, p. 9). 
1 We are not here discussing the work of the employment manager 
(see Chapter IV). Until recently the movement for improving the 
work of the employment manager has had little direct connection with 
“scientific management,” 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-211
    THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 201 
Taylor’s plan calls for detailed instruction cards to 
be issued to every man, for helpers or teachers who 
direct and record the work of the men, and for payment 
by results. It is a distinct departure from mere piece- 
work, as well as from the “ initiative and incentive 
plan”; these last put the responsibility for success 
chiefly if not wholly on the men, while scientific manage- 
ment requires highly specialized effort on the part of 
the superintendents and foremen of the establishment. 
The net result to the employer is that the improved 
method of running his establishment will get more 
work done, with fewer men. Thus, though the wage 
per man is higher than before, the labor cost per unit 
of product is reduced. This principle of lowering labor 
cost by paying higher wages is perhaps the most striking 
feature of scientific management. 
Taylor antagonized the laboring men at the start by 
his approach from the side of profits to the employers, 
by his naive story of his struggles with the men in the shop, 
by the use of the stop-watch on the men, by his accusa- 
tions of loafing and laziness, and by his crude methods 
of inducing the men to submit to his experiments.? 
Moreover, his critics were not slow to point out certain 
social and economic implications in the system, which 
we shall discuss presently. 
1See Redfield, William C., The New Industrial Day, The Century 
Company, 1913. While in Congress, Redfield opposed the protective 
tariff on the ground that none would be needed if American manufac: 
turers would improve their methods. 
2See his conversation with “Schmidt” ; Principles, p. 44.
-P-A-G-E-212
202 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
Three other writers are well known in connection 
with the scientific management or efficiency movement : 
Gilbreth, Gantt, and Emerson (see bibliography). The 
first two worked in codperation with Taylor, while Emer- 
son’s plan is eclectic. Hoxie, who has recently contributed 
a study of the subject, states as his judgment that the 
Taylor system, being the most elaborate and most widely 
followed, may still be taken as the standard plan. 
Scientific management had a bad start in that the men 
who launched it paid too little attention to certain 
fundamental social and economic facts. Things not 
explained, or loosely explained, left opportunity for 
attack. Thus Gilbreth admits but inadequately ex- 
plains the fact that with the output increased 300 
per cent a man’s wages are raised but 25 to 100 per 
cent (p. 89). Brandeis optimistically talks, in the fore- 
word to Gilbreth’s book, of codperation, square deal, 
men led, not driven, and a larger share for the working 
man, but refers the reader to no proof. Taylor (p. 71) 
shows output increased 269 per cent, wages increased 
64 per cent, and cost of production per ton decreased 
54 per cent. Again (p. 95) he makes a great point of 
the fact that 35 girls did the work formerly done by 120, 
but he gives little inkling of the economic and social 
problem involved in the cases of the 85 girls discharged.? 
1 Hoxie, pp. 7-8.

from the standpoint of organized labor, see John Mitchell, The Wage 
Earner and His Problems, Chap. IV, The Wage Earner and Industrial 
Efficiency. 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
    THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 203, 
It has remained for Hoxie! to analyze the claims, 
practices, advantages, and disadvantages of scientific 
management, as it existed in 1915. Professor Hoxie 
made his investigations in connection with the work of 
the federal Commission on Industrial Relations, and had 
the advantage of expert assistance representing both 
employers and labor, frequent consultations with Tay- 
lor, Gantt, Emerson, and many others, and of visits to 
establishments operating under scientific management. 
His general conclusions are that the claims of the plan 
to benefit labor are not proved. 
Some of his conclusions are as follows: The “ time- 
study ” men, who hold the key to the system, are neither 
equipped as a class for their important work nor do they 
hold an influential place in the managerial staff (p. 57). 
These time-study men set the tasks for the workers, and 
. it must not be forgotten that greater knowledge 
creates also greater opportunities for the unscrupulous and 
that a method, which in benevolent and intelligent hands 
makes better dealing possible, may be woefully abused by 
the ignorant and unscrupulous, and observation proves that 
time study for task setting is no exception to the rule (p. 53). 
Mr. Emerson would not claim with Taylor that 
scientific management always and of necessity deals 
out exact justice to the worker (p. 13). Scientific 
1 Note also Thompson, Clarence B. This symposium on scientific 
management is chiefly descriptive, and planned after the method of the 
advocate rather than the judge. Labor’s point of view is not explicitly 
given; neither are economic and social considerations elaborated. For 
studies of the effect of speeding-up work, see Goldmark.
-P-A-G-E-214
  204 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
managers express a preference for the one-job man, 
so that narrow specialization is the result (p. 38). Taylor 
advocated a complete reorganization of the establish- 
ment, so that increased returns would be unlikely for 
about two years. Hoxie finds, however, that scientfic 
managers are early pressed for a financial showing, 
and thus plans are inadequately carried out (p. 29). 
Coming more closely now to the problem of vocational 
guidance, Professor Hoxie finds, in the shops under 
scientific management, no systematic grappling with 
the problem of selecting and hiring men. He found 
that many heads of labor departments were young and 
inexperienced, that they were unacquainted with the 
best practices, and that best results were obtained in 
some shops not under scientific management (p. 33). 
Let us quote his statements about the adaptation of 
the work to the worker: 
Nowhere did the writer discover any scientific or adequate 
methods employed for adapting the worker to the task, that 
is, for “setting each man to the highest task for which his 
physical and intellectual capacity fits him.” .. . Experi- 
mental tests may have been made by scientific management 
experts, psychological and physiological, for determining 
special industrial qualifications and aptitudes of workers, 
but none of them was discovered in the shops. Indeed, the 
impression of the writer was very strong that the average 
manager in a scientific management shop is not only quite 
indifferent to, but profoundly ignorant of, the broader and 
deeper aspects of the problem of vocational selection and 
adaptation (p. 35). 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 205 
It has afforded little opportunity . . . for the discovery 
and development of special aptitudes among the masses 
(p. 93). 
Considering next the question of industrial peace 
and rights of the workers, we find these conclusions : 
. . . the whole scheme of scientific management, especially 
the gathering up and systematization of the knowledge 
formerly in the possession of the workmen, tends enormously 
to add to the strength of capitalism (p. 134; see also p. 131).! 
In its extension it is certain that scientific management 
is a constant menace to industrial peace (p. 135). 
[Evidence] in no way justifies the assumption that scien- 
tific management offers any effective guarantee against 
overspeeding and exhaustion of workers (p. 91). s 
There can be little doubt that scientific management tends, 
in practice, to weaken the power to the individual worker 
as against the employer (p. 104). 
. . . the democratic possibilities of scientific manage- 
ment, barring the presence of unionism, would seem to be 
scant (p. 107). 
Discussing the question of fundamental harmony of 
interests between capital and labor, claimed by Taylor, 
Hoxie finds that some managers agree with the labor 
unions in finding a conflict of interests between the two. 
Others, however, lay claim to a belief in industrial democ- 
racy, but “ the democracy of this class of managers usu- 
ally turned out to be on analysis a species of benevolent 
despotism often very worthy indeed, but far removed from 
the Taylor conception in its scientific purity ” (p. 102).

    206 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
On pages 137-139 of Hoxie’s book the report as given 
to the Commission on Industrial Relations is presented. 
It is signed by all three investigators. They find that 
scientific management “is to date the latest word 
in the sheer mechanics of production and inherently in 
line with the march of events.” They state, however, 
that the social problem created by scientific manage- 
ment does not lie in this field, but rather in the direct 
and indirect effects upon labor. Thus, a conflict ap- 
parently exists between efficient methods of doing things 
and human rights, both of which are good, and both 
of which must survive. The Commission is advised 
to conduct experiments in the codrdination and har- 
monizing of these forces.! 
So much for the problems of scientific management. 
It is apparent that the boys and girls who go into oc- 
cupations to which scientific management is applicable 
must be taught neither to glorify mere efficiency nor to 
try to turn back the hands of the clock as did the laborers 
who broke machinery during the early part of the last 
century. They must understand that not even the most 
complex mechanical and psychological adjustments can 
be substituted for common justice and provision for 
the good citizenship of the masses, and, on the other 
hand, that the cry “every man should have what he 
earns ” means nothing unless it takes into consideration 
1We are not here concerned with the vigorous discussion on the valid- 
ity of Hoxie’s method and conclusions. His book certainly points out 
unsolved problems which vitally concern the worker. 
   
-P-A-G-E-217
    THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 207 
the legitimate rights of the management. The student 
of vocational guidance must follow the ramifications of 
this problem, and must contribute to its solution. 
What Efficiency Offers Society.—The vocational coun- 
selor must approve of and coédperate with the movements 
for increasing the efficiency of individuals and establish- 
ments; he must remember, however, that social safe- 
guards must not be lost sight of. There is no denying 
the fact, for example, that in some men’s minds effi- 
ciency is thought to be the cure for all sorts of business 
and personal failures, whereas a mere sharpening of 
the ‘‘ race for success,’ without consideration for the 
successes of the many, might lead to social disaster 
rather than betterment. The advertisements of the 
business magazines must not be allowed to lead our 
boys and girls to think only of their own personal effi- 
ciency. The school’s task is to teach group efficiency 
as well — the pupils must be shown how the applica- 
tion of social efficiency can save the “waste of un- 
guided ability,” + improve methods of distribution? and 
save society the enormous wastes in various forms of 
preventable friction. 
The responsibility for these new forms of efficiency 
is being widely recognized. Efforts to extend educa- 
tional opportunity, to provide industrial education, to 
establish settlements, to bring about codperative school- 
ing, to seck the aid of advisory committees, and

-P-A-G-E-218
208 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
to supplement in various ways the work of the 
schools — all show that the social aim is not being lost 
sight of. 
Personal efficiency must be cultivated by the schools, 
and the child must be taught that his own efforts to im- 
prove his abilities are indispensable to his success. 
He must also be shown, however, that lasting and satis- 
factory rewards come only to those who use their abili- 
ties in performing useful service. Efficiency, in other 
words, must be used for producing commodities useful 
to the social whole, and not for mere personal aggran- 
dizement in a struggle to rise above competitors. These 
considerations must be understood by the counselor, 
and must form part of the educational and vocational 
guidance of the child. 
The Employer’s Problem in the “Turnover” of 
Employees. — Investigations show that employers are 
forced to put up with the aimless migration of workers 
from one establishment to another. This requires con- 
stant effort spent in teaching duties tonew men. Recent 
computations by Alexander (see bibliography) of the 
General Electric Company set the costs for training men 
as follows: highly skilled worker, $48; next grade, 
$38-50; unskilled worker, $8.50; clerk, $29; piece- 
worker, $65.50. Ina study of twelve factories, he found 
that at the beginning of 1912 the number of employees 
was 38,668; at the end, 46,796, and that during the 
year there were 44,365 persons hired, an apparently 
unnecessary engagement of 22,225 workers, after all
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 209 
allowances are made, who were hired and “ broken in ” 
at a total cost of $774,139. 
Investigations show that establishments engage each 
year a number of new workers which is from twenty 
to three hundred per cent of their regular force, and that 
the cost of replacing a worker is ordinarily from thirty 
to one hundred dollars.!. Mr. A. Lincoln Filene states 
that it is the experience of his business “ that the per- 
centage of college men who fail to stick to the first 
job that they try on leaving college is as large, if not 
larger, than the boy who hasn’t been through college.” ? 
The vocational counselor, then, must cope with these 
facts: that there is a well-established habit among 
workers to change from job to job, of their own accord ; 
that this causes a very large waste of time and money; 
that part of these changes are educative, in that the 
trial and success method is the only one open to most 
individuals; that both school and employer must study 
the problem, with the hope of providing for experimen- 
tation in the school, specifying in advance the require- 
ments of the job, and supervising the entrance into the 
occupation.* 
Other Problems of the Employer. — Complexities 
hedge the employer about, in the modern systems of 
business and industry, so that it is not surprising that 
mistakes are made. The professional attitude is only

  210 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
gradually being developed; men in business have here- 
tofore had no ready way to find out about the failures 
and successes of plans tried by their rivals. 
One of the mooted points is in regard to health ad- 
vice and help. The Clothcraft Shops in Cleveland have 
frequent medical examinations of their workers,’ and 
treatment is furnished both in the shops and in the homes. 
William Filene’s Sons Company of Boston have equipped 
a hospital in the store, and offer but do not compel 
medical examination, advice, and treatment. Many 
establishments handling foodstuffs safeguard cleanliness 
by means of physical examinations. Many firms give 
examinations such as eyesight tests upon entering em- 
ployment. Variety of practice prevails. Workers do not 
always welcome examinations, for they fear that they are 
aimed at discovering defects which will cost them their 
positions and perhaps make it difficult to secure other em- 
ployment. It would seem that a solution to the prob- 
lem of health guidance might be found in a simple 
test, when obviously needed, on entering employment, 
and frequent inspection to safeguard the workers and 
the product. Then medical examination, advice, and 
treatment might be left wholly in the hands of the 
workers, through mutual benefit associations or labor 
unions. 
Health examination and advice relating to occupations 
prior to employment, may be given by the school au- 
thorities, with the chief purpose of keeping children 
1 See Feiss. 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
    THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 2ir 
out of places which might injure them.! Note what has 
been said (pp. 165-168) on the dangers of guidance 
through over-attention to physical characteristics. Such 
advice would certainly have erred in the cases of Steven- 
son, Beethoven, and Dalton. 
The movement for “Safety First” has interested 
employers, especially in view of recent compensation 
laws. The best progress has been achieved when the 
workers themselves have had a part in the movement. 
The California Bureau of Labor Statistics in a recent 
report (p. 97) gives the plan of a lumber company, 
which formed a committee of five, three of whom were 
employees, to confer about safety and to recommend 
precautions against accidents. 
Another pressing problem is that concerned with social 
work, formerly called “ welfare work.” When large 
bodies of workers are in one establishment there is an 
obvious necessity to provide for lunchrooms, rest rooms, 
opportunity for noon-time recreation, and for other 
facilities for unifying the force. Feiss holds that the 
spirit of the worker, shown in his loyalty to the manage- 
ment, is a much more important requirement than ini- 
tial skill. 
How shall these activities be instituted and main- 
tained? William Filene’s Sons Company puts them 
entirely in the hands of the employees, while the Larkin 
Company directs them through the employment man- 
ager. Both companies have extensive facilities for 
1 See Bloomfield, Readings, pp. 704-711; Youth, etc., pp. 148-157. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  212 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
social activities, and in the case of each the company 
pays the expense. 
The issues involved in social work are complex. On 
the one hand, some establishments have a shifting force 
largely composed of unskilled workers, who live a sordid 
life in their homes, have little initiative for codpera- 
tion, and work and act like automata in the shop. On 
the other hand, if anything is done to brighten their 
lives in the recesses of shop work, they complain that 
they would “rather have the money in wages.” The 
lot of the director of social work is often a hard one, 
dependent as he is on the good graces both of the man- 
agement and of the workers.1 
Against these discouraging experiences, however, there 
are being set many hopeful experiments in codperative 
endeavor. If the cigar makers in New York City 
shops will unite to hire somebody to read to them while 
they work, it becomes likely that factory workers will 
find it advisable to raise no complaint against innova- 
tions which make the hours of labor happier ones. It 
is true that the managers who have had success with 
social work find that it means increased returns through 
better work on the part of the employees. Then the 
owners need only acknowledge this fact, and raise wages 
correspondingly, as many of them have done. The 
workers do not really object to social work as such, but 
they wish opportunity to work out their own self-direc-

-P-A-G-E-223
    
THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 213 
tion in things which have to do with leisure time. This 
desire is commendable, and should be encouraged. 
Another problem of the employer—and this the 
student of vocational guidance must especially consider 
—is the ever-recurring question of legislation affecting 
his business. These are the days of many laws, and 
no merchant can be sure, from one session of the legis- 
lature to another, that his business will not be put in 
jeopardy. The congress fixes tarifis and interstate 
commerce laws, and the city council taxes and licenses 
him. Hours of labor, minimum wages, safety laws, 
fire escapes, air shafts, elevator rules, windows and 
lighting, building laws, and a hundred other subjects 
may be altered by state statute which subject him to 
fine or imprisonment. Armies of inspectors visit him, 
besides many kindly social workers who will shortly press 
the legislators for more reforms, when the present ones 
are enforced. In helping to rationalize industrial and 
commercial legislation the vocational-guidance student 
will render great service to society. If employment 
supervision becomes an actuality, the vocation bureau 
will be better equipped to perform this service of guid- 
ing legislation than perhaps any other agency. More 
even than the legislator the counselor will represent 
the social interests of the public, besides which he will 
have intimate and authoritative contact with employer, 
worker, factory, home, and school. 
So much for the problems of the employer. Our 
theses are two: that the student of vocational guidance
-P-A-G-E-224
  214 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
must understand and contribute to the solution of these 
problems, and, second, that he must see that the future 
employers and employees understand them too, and 
that they go out of the school ready to improve upon 
the attempted solutions made by the present genera- 
tion. 
The Problems of the Employed. — Many of the prob- 
lems of the workers are the same as those of the em- 
ployers, though the viewpoint is the opposite. In dis- 
cussing scientific management above, we touched on 
the question of some present conflicting interests be- 
tween the two parties, and on the necessity for recon- 
ciling efficient management with human rights. It 
should be noted at this point, however, that the com- 
plaint of labor is not always against machinery, or effi- 
ciency as such, but rather at the unfair advantages which 
these institutions give to management. Put in its most 
intelligent form, it is not a protest against any set of 
men or any particular way of doing business, but rather 
an objection to the continuance of conditions which 
may be corrected with benefit to all concerned. 
The Need for Guidance in Obtaining Work. — The 
growth of the factory system has almost eliminated the 
industrial laborer who works for himself and employs 
no help. We have been unable to find data on the sub- 
ject, but it is very likely true that the small shop keepers, 
the small farmers, and certain professional people would 
represent the greater part of this remnant of an individ- 
ualistic system of occupations. Moreover, since these 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 215 
occupations require capital or highly-specialized train- 
ing, we may say, broadly speaking, that it is impossible 
nowadays for the average man to work without first 
seeking the opportunity. 
Without guidance, the natural results of this condi- 
tion would be, for the unskilled, at least, unemployment, 
poverty, exploitation, low wages, lack of adaptation 
to the work obtained, and loss of self-respect. To seek 
for work the laborer goes to an employment agency, or 
answers a “want ad.” The California Bureau of 
Labor Statistics reports 923 complaints against em- 
ployment agencies for misrepresentation, for the year 
ending June 30, 1914, 632 of which were decided for the 
petitioners and over $2300 ordered returned (pp. 10-11). 
The Manly report! for the Commission on Industrial 
Relations states : 
A study of newspaper want advertisements made a few 
years ago revealed that when times are good one fourth or 
more are “fake ads,” while in hard times more than one 
half are in this class (p. 171). 
The existence of these conditions shows the need of 
guidance, both for adults and for children. 
Unemployment. — Bound up with the necessity for 
seeking work is the problem of unemployment. Dearle 
shows how wastefully trades are recruited with workers, 
there being always a list of hangers-on for every large

labor. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to all those who refuse to 
be satisfied that the status quo does not need improvement.

establishment, waiting to be employed.! The Manly 
report for the Commission on Industrial Relations 
devotes twenty-two pages to the subject of unemploy- 
ment, every word of which is worthy of quotation 
here, had we the space available. The student of voca- 
tional guidance must use this report as one of his text- 
books. The studies on which these findings are based 
were conducted in all parts of the country, and justify 
the summary statement that: 
A careful analysis of all available statistics shows that in 
our great basic industries the workers are unemployed for 
an average of at least one fifth of the year, and that at all 
times during any normal year there is an army of men, who 
can be numbered only by hundreds of thousands, who are 
unable to find work or who have so far degenerated that they 
cannot or will not work. Can any nation boast of industrial 
efficiency when the workers, the source of her productive 
wealth, are employed to so small a fraction of their productive 
capacity ? 
These conclusions are borne out by a recent study of 
employment in Philadelphia, conducted under the direc- 
tion of the Department of Public Works by Joseph H. 
Willits, Instructor in Industry, Warton School of the 
University of Pennsylvania. Textile mills and garment 
factories operate from twenty to eighty per cent of full 
1 Bloomfield, Readings, p. 34. 
2P. 34; see also pp. 161, 162, 23, 34, 163, 164, 170-183. Even 
should the war solve the unemployment problem for years to come, yet, 
if the causes of unemployment are untouched, the evil will ultimately 
reappear. 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
    
THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 217 
time. Published charts show great fluctuation in 
number of workers employed (pp. 24, 39, 41, 44, 45). 
The effect of unemployment on poverty, family life, 
and crime is discussed on pages 49-57. Particularly 
interesting is the diary of a man’s experience in one day’s 
hunt for work, with the accompanying map (pp. 115- 
116). 
To the student of vocational guidance, one of the 
most interesting conclusions of this Philadelphia report 
is that unemployment forces men to take up work for 
which they are not fitted: to take anything that offers, 
with the common result that the worker is never able 
to return to his own trade. 
During the winter of 1913-1914 Arthur Evans Wood 
of Reed College conducted an intensive study of the 
unemployed in Portland, Oregon. His findings are 
similar to the data already quoted. He concludes: 
These facts constitute a grave social problem, the solu- 
tion of which devolves upon the state and city and national 
authorities, inasmuch as the welfare of the state is dependent 
upon the welfare of its industrial workers (p. 32). 
Various remedies for unemployment have been pro- 
posed and partially tried. The Dennison Manufactur- 
ing Company of Framingham made a systematic effort 
to eliminate the seasonal rush, by seeking early orders 
for Christmas trade, by making containers and other 
cheaper products far in advance of need, and by devel- 
oping a trade for and manufacturing new goods used 
1 Willits, The Unemployed in Philadelphia, p. 5.
-P-A-G-E-228
  
  218 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
throughout the dull seasons. Such companies recognize 
the value of a steady force of workers, and see that a 
highly seasonal business may become a menace rather 
than a benefit to the community. 
Insurance against unemployment has been proposed, 
but the contributory feature seems impracticable in 
view of the attitude of labor and the shifting of men 
from place to place. Nevertheless, some of the states 
may confidently be expected to experiment with such 
legislation, based on European experience. 
Another remedy which seems eminently desirable 
is the adjustment of public work so that it will become 
greatest at times of most unemployment. The argu- 
ment behind this plan is that legislation now protects 
the individual in his life, health, safety from fire and 
accident, property, morals, and education; but offers 
very inadequate protection against poverty. It is 
fully as necessary for society to protect itself against 
the results of unemployment, as brought about by idle- 
ness, discouragement, and crime. If, therefore, the 
city, state, and nation should offer any person out of 
employment opportunity to work, at a figure which need 
not compete with present and well-established businesses 
and industries, no one would have the present excuses 
for idleness, begging, charity, wife-desertion, burglary 
and other evils against society. 
The most common proposal for the cure of unem- 
ployment is one that has been tried in many American 
cities and states — the public employment bureau. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
    
THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 21g 
is now recognized that interstate or national federation 
is necessary for the success of public employment bureaus, 
and even then the problem will hardly be solved without 
concurrent application of some of the other remedies 
noted above. But the widespread establishment of 
state and municipal employment agencies, with a central 
bureau issuing bulletins such as emanate from the 
Weather Bureau, would go far toward relieving the 
present pressure on the unskilled. 
What has the vocational counselor to do with the 
unemployment problem? He must first of all see that 
it cannot completely be solved inside the schoolroom by 
equipping each prospective worker with skill in business 
or industry. ‘The causes of unemployment are not 
merely individual, — physical incapacity, lack of train- 
ing, inefficiency, and unwillingness to work, — they are 
usually general and quite beyond the control of the 
individual workman.”! On this account the counselor 
must help in the effort to solve the problem by collec- 
tive action, and he must warn the future workers con- 
cerning the conditions which they will meet. 
Wages are often Inadequate. — Another difficulty, 
from the viewpoint of the employed, lies in the question 
of wages. A few years ago Professor Nearing found that 
the average man in the United States received less than 
$600 yearly, and the female worker less than $400. 
Even then there is difficulty; the California Bureau 
of Labor Statistics reports that in three years’ time 
1 Coman, p. 667.
-P-A-G-E-230
  220 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
12,802 complaints were registered with the bureau 
against employers for non-payment of wages. “ The 
Bureau succeeded in collecting 8409 of the claims 
amounting to $171,808.21” (p. 15). 
The Worker’s Right to Satisfaction and Development 
in his Work. — Lack of individual development and 
satisfaction in the occupation, even when the worker is 
steadily employed, is the consequence of certain charac- 
teristics of industry and commerce already noted. 
The need for supervision and the demand that should 
be made for the job to give an account of itself is force- 
fully stated by Bloomfield in Youth, School, and Voca- 
tion, p. 26. The worker has the right to ask what the 
job will do for him — where he will be after five or ten 
years of work. 
Every manufacturer, as well as every student of vo- 
cational guidance, should read Dean Schneider’s “Laws 
of the Two Kinds of Work,” on pages 10-11 of Educa- 
tion for Industrial Workers. It is a graphic description 
of the development of a modern factory town, and clearly 
shows what must be alleviated, cured, or prevented. 
What the cure may be no one knows, but that some of 
the many plans being tried or being proposed will re- 
lieve conditions no one can doubt. And there can be 
no possibility of anything but hopefulness when one 
considers the tremendous progress that twenty years 
has brought. 
Labor Organizations. — Few students of the subject 
openly advocate the abandonment of labor organiza- 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
         THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 221 
tions, but many have grave doubts and important 
qualifications regarding them. Thus, while Hoxie (p. 
138) and Manly (p. 183) claim that in no other way 
than by the development of labor union strength and 
collective bargaining can the problems of industry and 
commerce be met, some of the members of the Com- 
mission on Industrial Relations direct their attention 
solely to the mistakes of these organizations (pp. 414- 
442). Regardless of such terms as “autocracy of 
wealth,” ‘class struggle,” and ‘ mob rule,” however, 
the fact is patent that both sides to the controversy 
have sinned against society, and the further fact that 
somehow they must be made to serve society. The 
better statements and better policies of either, rather 
than the worst, must be accepted at the fullest value 
possible, and their good intentions capitalized! The 
vocational counselor, knowing the needs and the prob- 
lems of each, can materialy assist in the work. 
The Value of Constructive Discontent in Solving 
Labor Problems. — The spread of education is sure to 
be accompanied by certain forms of discontent among 
the workers, and it is the business of the vocational 
counselor to see that this discontent becomes construc- 
1 John Mitchell, in a recent New York City speech, declared these 
points to constitute the program of labor: a minimum wage conformable 
to American standards; the eight-hour day; abolition of child labor; 
safety in work and compensation for injuries; better housing conditions; 
preservation of the guarantees of trial by jury, free speech, and a free 
press. The student of vocational guidance can surely go with the unions 
thus far, reserving the right to part company on other points, if necessary.   
   
    
-P-A-G-E-232
       THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
  222 
tive and helpful to society. Whether or not we out- 
line these problems to the children in school, the brighter 
among them will later read and study on their own ac- 
count, and will become intelligent in the solutions at- 
tempted if our vocational guidance is directed to that end. 
Constructive discontent must see that ‘“ democracy 
means something more than the right to vote. De- 
mocracy means the abolition of special privilege and the 
securing of equal opportunity for all.” Without eco- 
nomic and social knowledge of a protective sort the 
individual worker would be as helpless as a farmer 
without means of transportation, and the school must 
give the pupil this knowledge and aid him to secure the 
rightful protection. We may claim not that the world 
owes each man a living, but that the world should 
yield each worker a foothold — an opportunity to work 
and to advance.! 
We cannot here discuss the problem of how much or 
how little the children in our schools should be led to 
consider these things. That is a matter of many factors 
particular to each time and situation. But that the 
child should be equipped to grapple with them is not 
to be doubted, if we are educating him for a democracy.? 
1 Veblen shows that, even with dynasties destroyed and a league to 
enforce peace established, autocracy of wealth will breed world war 
(The Nature of Peace, Chapter VII). 
2 The narrow viewpoint of those arguing for a narrow form of educa- 
tion is shown by Shorey’s assumption that democracy is expressed by 
“equality before the law” (The Assault on Humanism, p. 36). If this 
attitude be “humanism,” obviously a scholar and an idiot could be 
equal before the law, and thereby ‘‘ democracy ” would be achieved.    
  
-P-A-G-E-233
  THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 223 
May we not even go so far as to say that every child 
should be broadly educated for an “‘ energizing ” occu- 
pation, and then if he cannot find that kind of employ- 
ment we may at least be sure that an intelligent and 
constructive discontent will be at work to better con- 
ditions about him. In reference to wrongs existing in 
the occupations, the future worker must be taught 
that mere submission means individual atrophy and 
social stagnation, and that mere strife is no more effi- 
cacious than would be running against a wall; but that 
intelligent and constructive adjustment and codpera- 
tion is best. 
We should derive our optimism by considering the 
blessings already gained. A talk with one who has 
lived under long-passed conditions of work may well 
be made an exercise of the class for the study of occu- 
pations. Thus, some women still live who worked in 
textile mills from 4: 45 in the morning till 7: 30 at night. 
Such progress as we have already made assures us of 
the future. 
The Many Signs of Improvement. — But our hope for 
the future is not based entirely on contrast with the 
past. There are some sharp contrasts in the present — 
some experiments being conducted, and succeeding, 
which are pointing the way to the solution of vexing 
questions. Many of these have been touched upon 
already: the reduction of the labor turnover; the 
opportunity to transfer from one department of an 
establishment to another; the “ blue-printing” of a
-P-A-G-E-234
    224 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
job; the employment supervision exercised by certain 
schools and placement agencies; the Birmingham volun- 
tary committees; improved legislation in regard to 
child labor; the decision of certain firms to employ 
no child under sixteen; the establishment of new kinds 
of schools and courses; the promotion of recreation 
both for children and for adults. 
In addition to these signs of improvement we cannot 
fail to note the new spirit of codperation possessing the 
employer and the school. The four recent industrial 
surveys — those in Richmond, Minneapolis, Cleveland, 
and Indiana — were made possible only by such joint 
action. The development of this spirit marks a new era 
in vocational guidance, if not in the whole employment 
problem. The Minneapolis Survey! was able to work 
out a series of trade agreements to include the school, 
the industry, and the worker. Such agreements bid fair 
to bring back an apprentice system, revised to fit modern 
conditions and very greatly improved (let us hope) 
because the school has a place in them. 
Another hopeful indication is the spread of the idea 
of arbitration for labor differences, and the judicial 
settlement of claims and disputes. The California 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (pp. 15-48) deals with the 
laws and their operation in that state, and the Manly 
report for the Commission of Industrial Relations (pp. 
133-139 and 191-202) outlines what may be expected 
shortly.

  THE PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT 225 
Coéperation in industry, profit sharing, and all move- 
ments in the direction of industrial democracy are of 
special significance to the student of vocational guidance. 
Methods of approach are rapidly being worked out, and 
evidence to prove the wisdom of the experiments is 
growing in volume. 
The cooperation being practiced in the store of William 
Filene’s Sons Company in Boston is typical of what may 
soon come to pass in many other establishments. The 
extent of the plan, the success of its operation, and the 
spirit of the clubrooms, remind one strongly of the 
student-government activities of the large Los Angeles 
High Schools. It gives renewed hope for the ordering 
of work so that educative values may be conserved. 
It is more than likely that some such codperative 
schemes, developed as fast as solid experience and the 
growing intelligence of the workers will allow, may 
point the way to a form of industrialism appropriate to 
a democracy. 
The Lessons for Vocational Guidance. — During the 
progress of this chapter we have repeatedly indicated the 
duty of the counselor to study the problems of employ- 
ment, to codperate with both employer and worker in 
the solution of these problems, to represent the educa- 
tional forces of society in the effort to conserve youth 
and hopefulness, and to equip the future worker for 
effective grappling with these complex problems. 
It should now be apparent that the student of voca- 
tional guidance should take an active interest in legis- 
Q 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  226 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
lation which concerns school and labor, and should aid 
in the effort for better laws. It should further be clear 
that school pupils must be taught the principles and 
practice of codperation, for only by joint action can 
certain difficulties be overcome. Schools must provide 
a measure of self-government, with the direction of 
student activities more or less in the hands of the pupils. 
By such methods young people will learn the true mean- 
ings of both obedience and leadership, and we may 
confidently expect that the workers themselves will 
join in bringing to fruition the “ hope that the near 
future will see our schools unite with the best employers 
to further, during its decisive years, youth’s promise of 
service and growth.” !

  CHAPTER VIII 
A PRocRAM FoR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
Our study so far has included (1) A statement of the 
problems of vocational guidance; (2) A review of present 
attempts to provide guidance in schools and in occupa- 
tions; (3) A study of educational as related to vocational 
guidance; (4) An examination of the work of the coun- 
selor; (5) A criticism of some questionable methods in 
guidance; (¢) A study of the young worker in industry 
and commerce; and (7) A survey of the problems of 
employment. It will be the purpose of this chapter to 
summarize tle conclusions reached in the foregoing 
studies, and therewith to outline a proposed program for 
effective vocational guidance. 
A Working Definition of Vocational Guidance. — In the 
first chapter we noted the propriety of proceeding on the 
assumption that the ordinary meanings of the two words 
“vocational”? and “guidance” should hold valid. In 
spite of disagreements as to the exact meaning of the word 
“vocational,” differences in applying the guidance, and at- 
tempts of classifiers to mark off the divisions of the subject,1 
1 See the definition in the Massachusetts law and Professor Moore’s 
Criticism in What is Education, p. 164. Notice also the ordinary use 
of the term on page 316 of the same book. 
A recent writer separates our subject into (1) Educational guidance; 
227
-P-A-G-E-238
    228 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCI? MOVEMENT 
the common, dictionary definitions give us the most 
light. We may therefore propose tie following as a 
workable statement : — 
‘Vocational guidance is a systematic eTort, based on 
knowledge of the occupations and on acquaintance with and 
study of the individual, to inform, advise, or operate with 
him in choosing, preparing for, entering ve, or making 
progress in his occupation. 
With this definition in mind, we shall divide our 
study of an appropriate program for vocational guidance 
into the following topics, which will form the subject 
matter of this chapter: (1) The types of schpols needed ; 
(2) The function of the school people; (3) Codperative 
effort for vocational guidance; (4) The improvement of 
the conditions of employment ; (5) Methods of guidance; 
(6) Training in vocational guidance; (7) Some appro- 
priate next steps. 
The Types of Schools Needed for Vocational Guidance. 
— In order that vocational guidance may find its most 
efficient expression, the schools must be organized in a 
manner conformable with the best educational theory 
and practice. It is now generally recognized that the 
(2) Vocational guidance; (3) Avocational guidance (see Jacobs). For 
convenient treatment, there is some justification for this classification, 
but not for logical division. As we have seen in Chapter I, the first two 
of these classes greatly overlap. ‘“Avocational’”? is hardly the word. 
It is questionable to call duties of citizenship avocational; this is 
Moore’s objection. Again, Jesse Davis shows that moral and civic 
duties do not “call away’’ from the vocation, but aid it and are aided by 
it. Finally, the word “avocational”’ has indefinite and contradictory 
meanings, as a reference to the dictionary will show. 
 
-P-A-G-E-239

education of the children should be under state control, 
with authority delegated to local boards and commit- 
tees except in those matters where centralization seems 
advisable, as for example, certification of teachers ; appor- 
tionment of the school tax; special aid for rural, agricul- 
tural, and vocational education; and minimum require- 
ments in school term, buildings, salaries, and programs 
of studies. State boards as well as local boards or 
committees may call to their assistance groups of men 
from all walks of life to act as advisory committees. 
Turning to the actual schools, we have seen that the 
movement for vocational guidance is interested in the 
progress of the child from his earliest years. The value 
of early play in the home has been noted. The kinder- 
garten gives opportunity for a social contact that should 
form a good foundation for later training, aids the 
children to develop the dramatic sense, and gives them, 
through the songs, games, sand-box, and other exercises, 
the beginnings of their acquaintance with occupations. 
Hewever rudimentary these gains are, from a vocational 
point of view, the child with the kindergarten training 
should be better off than one without it. Kindergartens 
should therefore form a part of the school system which 
aims to provide vocational guidance, and their methods 
should largely be followed in the earlier grades of the 
elementary school. 
The elementary school should equip its pupils with an 
interest in the basic fields of knowledge and experience.

  230 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
We have called attention in Chapter III to the vocational 
values in the various studies, and in a later portion of the 
present chapter we shall discuss the plan for a class in 
the study of occupations, the life-career class, for each 
grade beginning with the fourth. 
Class work is adapted to the great majority of children, 
but there must be provision for special classes and 
individual instruction paralleling the entire school 
system. Such classes should handle all those children 
who need the personal attention available for special 
groups. For the normal children, it may be safe to have 
class work with uniform curricula up to and including 
the sixth grade. Here the elementary school course 
may properly end. 
The intermediate or junior high school should include 
the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. Here differentia- 
tion of a positive sort should begin. Here, too, provision 
for -vocational_guidance must be clear and adequate. 
Three courses are often provided: the General Course, 
the Industrial Course, and the Business or Commercial 
Course, and each entering pupil must make his choice. 
Here is important opportunity to prevent wrong choice, 
and the counselor, in the person of the principal, vice- 
principal, or special advisor, should interview each child 
far enough in advance of his entrance to make the choice 
as deliberate as possible. 
But children at the age of thirteen are too young for 
making such momentous decisions. It may prove to be 
a better policy, therefore, to turn the intermediate school

into a prevocational school, with a great variety of 
offerings, and with each child put into contact with 
many different. kinds of activities. Consider, for 
example, the following list:

It is conceivable that a modern school system might 
offer most of these activities in the intermediate grades 
(or at least in the high school), and that a wide choice 
should be open to every child. Some subjects may be 
given in alternate years, and in a large city types of 
schools may offer different programs. Transportation 
facilities should be arranged for, however, so that no 
child will necessarily be limited to the work of the school 
nearest him.' In planning his curriculum for the three 
years of the intermediate school, each child might

among pupils. Hence it may be best to have every school maintain 
a large variety of activities, even if each study is carried on in miniature. 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
    
       A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 233 
be required to take certain prescribed studies, to take 
at least two subjects in every group, and to choose one 
group for comparative specialization. (Cf. the “ con- 
centration and distribution plan” of Harvard College.) 
For illustration, a given student might take all of the 
studies of Group I and the first three of Group II as 
required subjects ; might elect general science and music 
in Groups III and IV, typewriting and school clerical 
work in V, freehand and mechanical drawing in VI, and 
athletic games and participation in auditorium meetings 
in Groups VII and VIII, and might specialize in Group 
IX, taking agriculture, care of animals, dairying, com- 
petition in a dairy contest, and cement work. The 
amount of each subject, and the order of studies, would 
still remain to be determined. 
The justification for this plan of choice and trial is 
that the intermediate age is an experimental and a find- 
ing period, and a smattering of several things is better 
for its purposes than thoroughness in a few.’ Versa- 
tility is important here, at least as a first step toward 
discovery of powers and tastes. We do not mean 
that a child should be forced into versatility against 
his positive desire to specialize: the rules for required 
The general shop is a perfectly feasible plan for small schools of inter- 
mediate grade. A prevocational school is limited to an unwarranted 
degree if it has but one or two kinds of manual work. Suburban schools 
for urban children may in time offer a solution; here the schools of 
different types could be grouped within convenient reach of each 
other. 
1In schools of Rochester, Arlington, and other cities brief trial 
courses of six weeks or less have been provided.
-P-A-G-E-244
   
    234 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
and elected studies should be subject to change to suit 
individual needs. 
A lesson in method may be learned from the project 
idea of the Boy Scouts organization. Credits are given 
for definite tasks performed. To apply this plan to our 
list above, we should require our pupil, rather than to 
pass in certain studies, to give a talk before the school, 
to write a paper about the factories of his city, to type- 
write that paper, to make the pattern for a simple cast- 
ing, to make the casting, to bind a book, to raise a sheep, 
to wash ten school windows under the direction of the 
janitor. 
The plan here proposed is not so simple in its opera- 
tion as is the Los Angeles Intermediate school plan, in 
which the entering pupil chooses one of the five courses 
and proceeds through that course to graduation, with the 
presumption against the facility of his transfer to another 
course. The latter plan assumes that a wise choice can 
be made at the thirteenth year: there seems, however, 
to be little evidence to justify the assumption. The 
plan here proposed allows the pupil to make a choice of 
the activities which seem now to attract him, but insists 
that under usual circumstances he shall experiment 
with many other activities as well, so that at graduation 
he would have come into contact with a large number of 
the occupational experiences of life. 
If some of the children must earn money during the 
intermediate age, they should have half-time schooling 
as proposed in a former chapter (p. 197).    
-P-A-G-E-245
    A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 235 
With the entrance into high school we shall find that 
many of our pupils feel ready to specialize for definite 
callings, while others need a continuation of the broad 
experimentation described above. If we may judge by 
some observations already made, however, even those 
who have decided on their occupations are subject to 
change of mind. Our school courses, therefore, must 
be strongly interlocked, so that boys and girls may make 
needed transfers without loss of time. 
Vocational guidance is very much concerned with the 
question whether high schools should be general in 
character or whether they should each center their atten- 
tion on preparing for a restricted set of occupations. If 
efficiency in the occupation were the only consideration, 
the matter would not be a difficult one to settle. But 
there is the fact that pupils change their minds, and the 
further consideration that undemocratic ideals may be 
fostered by breaking up the high-school pupils into the 
“ classical ” group and the “ technical” group. Further 
experiment will be needed before a sufficiently clear 
answer can be given to the question. On the one hand, 
present experience seems to show specialization in the 
aim of the high school makes for efficiency in instruction 
and economy of expense; on the other hand the high 
school of varied program furnishes an opportunity for 
broad experimentation, and makes allowances for 
changes in the choice of occupation. It may be found 
that the specialized high school is best for those who have 
definitely chosen their occupations, while the general  
-P-A-G-E-246
23 6 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
school is best for those who have not. If this be the 
fact it would seem that both types of school are needed. 
The vocational counselor must contribute to the solution 
of these questions.’ 
We may be sure, in any case, that our high schools 
should provide broad curricula for those students who 
have not yet decided on their life-careers and for those 
who have chosen professions and plan to go to college, 
and should provide as well for those who wish specific 
vocational education and for those who are forced to 
work. Part-time work may finally be found the most 
practicable plan for all kinds of vocational education.? 
The relation of these questions to vocational guidance 
must be clear. Long before the pupil enters high school, 
he should have the benefit of counsel in regard to the 
different paths open to him. During the entire three 
or four years of his course he should have coéperation 
in making the important decisions which affect his 
future so profoundly. 
What college education should be, in view of vocational 
guidance, is rather too big a question for treatment here. 
We may protest in passing, however, against the assump- 
tion that the college course should be merely “ liberal ” 
and thereby indefinite, and that all specialization of a 
vocational sort should be deferred till the professional 
1 One student of vocational guidance has recently shown that the 
pupils in his high school—a commercial high school —are not by any 
means sure that they will enter the occupations for which this vocational 
school prepares. (E. A. Post, in an unpublished study.)

-P-A-G-E-247
  A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 237 
school. This policy takes no account of the many stu- 
dents wh» never go on to the professional school or who 
drop out before completing the college course. These 
students often leave college unfitted for vocational choice 
or for adaptation to the exigencies of actual work. 
All high: schools should have evening sessions, and 
should maiatain vacation schools as well. Further, the 
time may soon come when summer camps may be held 
under school auspices, and when trips of pupils may be 
a part of the school’s program.! We may hope, too, 
that a parent-teacher association be a part of each school’s 
plan, and that the teachers will coéperate with many 
social, civic, political, professional, commercial, and 
industrial organizations. Each school, too, should have 
a growing and changing museum, or at least should 
habitually codperate with such institutions in the vicinity. 
So much for the types of schools needed for vocational 
guidance. We shall next consider the part played in 
guidance by various school officers. 
The Function of the School People, in Vocational 
Guidance. — The teacher of whatever subject should 
be on the alert to find and use the vocational values in 
every lesson. His chief task is to act as educational 
guide, and he must make the educational guidance func- 
tion as vocational guidance whenever this seems desir- 
able. To do this he will need to widen the scope of 
classroom activity. Play, competition, and various 
1 Camps and trips are common in private schools and boys’ clubs; 
fees may be charged to help defray expenses. 
   
-P-A-G-E-248
238 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
forms of self-direction, group effort! and individual 
instruction should be utilized whenever possiole. De- 
bates in the history lessons, contests in arithmetic, 
dramatics in the language class, excursions for geog- 
raphy, original work in music, and competitions in 
drawing — all these show what may be done to open 
the way for discovery of talents. Johnson shows the 
need for competition in games?; much of the same 
spirit, if carefully supervised, can be profitably developed 
in other studies. 
How far in vocational guidance can the regular teachers 
go? No doubt all of them can make their studies count 
for guidance, and can systematically study their pupils. 
Many of them can offer occasional counsel, and a few can 
do efficient work based on knowledge of occupational 
opportunities. All of the teachers should be prepared 
to furnish significant information about each child to 
the counselors who specialize in the work. 
In many if not most schools for several years the 
teacher will be the only counselor the child has. Hence 
the need for our normal schools and colleges to give the 
prospective teachers the viewpoint of vocational guid- 
ance. As we remarked in a former place, the child’s 
teacher is most favorably situated to guide him; it 
would be desirable if every teacher could be a counselor. 
If the school has one or more teachers who are allowed 
part of their time for vocational guidance, these teachers

-P-A-G-E-249
    A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 239 
may begin their work, as we have suggested in Chapter 
IV, by investigating the causes of elimination from school, 
and by following the children’s careers as they enter upon 
work. These investigations will lead the teacher into 
contact with the occupations, and will thus give him 
valuable information to use in advising pupils. Other 
work which may profitably be undertaken is the employ- 
ment supervision of the graduates of the school. This 
of course should be done in codperation with the em- 
ployers. If some of the graduates are in business for 
themselves, they can be greatly assisted by friendly, 
intelligent advice, given by the counselor himself, or by 
men and women of experience who will codperate with 
the schools. 
The part-time counselor may also make home visits, 
and may collect composite information about the child 
and his progress. He should be prepared to counsel 
children as to courses and change of curricula, and to 
furnish aid to any teacher in connection with vocational 
guidance. He should collect literature on vocations, 
and should have charge of the life-career classes of the 
school. 
The school principal, if he cannot have a part-time 
counselor in his staff, should do all or most of this work 
himself, or should apportion it among his teachers. He 
should see that cumulative record cards are kept, so 
that the successes of the child may be continued as he 
advances in the school. These records may be fre- 
quently renewed or revised, and should register changes
-P-A-G-E-250
  240 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
of viewpoint on the part of the child, his school marks, 
the preferences of his parents, and his interests outside 
the school studies. Except in the case of grave necessity, 
nothing derogatory should be recorded. 
The principal’s leadership among the pupils largely 
determines the spirit of the school. The lessons of 
codperation learned through the varied manifestations 
of a good school spirit are so valuable that no princi- 
pal should fail to take advantage of the opportunity. 
Personal contact with the pupils, and an active sym- 
pathy with their problems in studies, athletics, and 
student activities, will go far toward preparing the 
ground for effective vocational guidance. 
Leadership of the teachers is not less in importance. 
If the principal can somehow make the teachers feel 
that they are really helping in determining the policies 
of the school, this cannot fail to make them consider 
more carefully the aims of the school and the means of 
realizing these aims. 
We come now to the question of an expert counselor 
and a central office. It is possible that the early writers 
on vocational guidance gave the impression that one’s 
becoming ‘expert’? gave him an occult power that 
others could not understand or approach. Between the 
teacher who is unconscious of vocational guidance, and 
a person of experience in counseling there is no gulf fixed ; 
the fact is merely that one teacher has studied and prac- 
ticed more than the other in the particular occupation 
of vocational guidance. Such a person may well begin 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 241 
as we have explained above; his ability will develop as 
his experience grows. 
How should the bureau be organized? In the first 
place it cannot be organized de novo; it must grow out of 
investigations and guidance activities in the different 
schools.1_ When these investigations have become so 
extensive that a clearing house is needed, then the 
bureau becomes a necessity. Until that time, school 
money had best be spent in allowing teachers in the 
individual schools time to do investigating and coun- 
seling. 
What relation should the bureau bear to other depart- 
ments of the school system? It may sometimes be 
necessary to have as its general director a head of 
department who has charge also of compulsory attend- 
ance, work certificates, placement, industrial work, and 
night schools; but none of these activities should be 
set above vocational guidance. Consolidation of 
departments may frequently be necessary, but absorp- 
tion and amalgamation should be prevented. The work 
of vocational guidance will most likely have vital con- 
nection with all the departments of the system, but it 
must be free to formulate its policies in the light of its 
own independent needs and investigations. As Miss 
Davis and Miss Lathrop have pointed out, guidance 
forced to serve present economic needs of children, with 
no outlook beyond, fails of its opportunity.2 The

2 Nat. V. G. Assn., 1914, pp. 49-52.
-P-A-G-E-252
242 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
bureau may profitably begin its work by interviewing 
those who apply to the school officers for work permits. 
It should be recognized that these studies are pathologi-   
      
cal, however, for as Hanus says, “ vocational guid- 
ance cannot be safely deferred until the pupil is on the 
threshold of the world’s work.” ! 
We shall not go into detail here on the many activities 
which a central bureau may profitably undertake. In 
brief it may collect, publish, and disseminate vocational 
information; aid in equipping teachers for the work of 
counseling; collect funds for scholarships for needy 
children; enlist the aid of college students in making 
investigations, business men for part-time work, advice, 
and coéperation, and civic, labor, commercial, industrial, 
and legislative organizations in improving conditions of 
labor; aid teachers in the solution of difficult problems ; 
and stand ready to offer help in whatever direction will 
count for the better guidance of pupil or worker. The 
bureau should have a select library on vocational 
guidance and vocations, and should codperate with public 
libraries. It should hold frequent conferences, at which 
are brought together the various interests concerned 
with work and guidance. It should strive unceasingly 
for opening new avenues of child-help, through all such 
plans as public employment bureaus, volunteer com- 
mittees to give advice to children, and school officers 
in all parts of the city ready to be consulted by any 
worker, young or old. Finally, its chief concerns 
1 Bloomfield, Readings, p. 94. 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
    
A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 243 
should be two: aiding in the work of improving the school 
program, and helping to bring about a system of employ- 
ment supervision which will extend the care of the 
school over all children. 
The work of the bureau may be subdivided, some 
assistants doing actual counseling, and others making 
studies of occupations. 
The superintendent of schools should first oi all chart 
his educational opportunities, or, better, join forces with 
civic organizations which will do the work in such a way 
as to include all educational institutions! He may 
actively assist the work in vocational guidance by lend- 
ing his support to the meetings, by attending conferences 
with employers and others, by showing pupils his interest 
in their life-careers, and by taking active part in the 
civic, commercial, industrial, and professional life of the 
community. In most cases, too, for the present, at least, 
he will need to impress on taxpayers, voters, and board 
members the necessity for using school money to stop the 
waste of unguided ability. 
The state officers of education can act with the state 
and federal officers who collect information about occupa- 
tions (see p. 135), and can aid in the distribution of 
printed matter. The state officers of education may 
aid in rousing dormant energy to be used for coun- 
seling. They may help in the inspection of industries, 
so that the welfare of the workers will be better

    244 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
The Bureau of Education at Washington should con- 
tinue and extend the expressions of its recent strong 
interest in vocational guidance. The bureau aids in 
issuing the Vocational-Guidance Bulletin; has published 
The School and the Start in Life, and the proceedings of 
the third national conference; and has under way at 
least two other studies for early publication. There 
are needed many more studies of occupations, a manual 
for students’ use in life-career classes, a classified index 
to the literature on the subject, and a comprehensive 
survey of the present attempts to provide vocational 
guidance. The Bureau at Washington is in a particularly 
good position to become a national and international 
clearing house of information on aims, plans, methods, 
and results in vocational guidance. 
We have so far briefly surveyed the function of the 
school people in vocational guidance. We hold that the 
schools should lead in the work, and in most cases direct 
whatever codperative effort shall be called forth. Guid- 
ance must not be considered an affair of fees, exploitation, 
advertising, or promotion of any sort, except educational. 
Those engaged in the work will have need of the highest 
ideals in education, both to keep their own activities in 
the correct channels, and to free the vocational guidance 
movement from tendencies which would seriously handi- 
cap its usefulness. 
Coéperative Effort on the Part of Those Interested in 
Guidance. — We have constantly taken the position 
that no strides forward can be taken in the voca- 
     
-P-A-G-E-255
  A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 245 
tional-guidance movement without the joint action 
of the forces interested. Codperation will be re- 
quired for almost all the processes connected with 
guidance; let us here consider that needed for the 
following: obtaining vocational information; choosing 
the occupation; preparing for the vocation; instituting 
and managing part-time work; placement; employ- 
ment supervision ; improving conditions of employment ; 
legislation. 
Coéperation for obtaining Vocational Information. — 
Vocational information can best be obtained as it was in 
Richmond and Minneapolis,—by the cordial joint 
action of employer, worker, and school. The teacher 
must be welcomed when he goes into the office, store, 
shop, or factory to ask questions, and he must be priv- 
ileged to ask the questions both of the managers and 
of the workers. The codperation must be so genuine 
that the investigator can be reasonably sure that the 
avenues of information are all open to him, and that the 
replies he gets to his questions are truthful, with nothing 
held back. Much yet remains to be done before these 
ideals are fully realized, but the progress during the past 
five years has been so astonishing that there is no doubt 
about the final outcome. 
On pages 128-137 we have outlined a plan for gather- 
ing the necessary information, and have indicated that 
clubs, associations, unions, and organizations of many 
other kinds can profitably join in the work. The school 
people should lead, because if equipped for the work /
-P-A-G-E-256
246 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
they will be the best judges regarding what knowledge 
is of most worth. The viewpoint of the school people 
in this particular should be determined by the researches 
and mature conclusions of the vocational-guidance de- 
partment. In the work of gathering information the 
children in the schools can help; the knowledge most 
useful to them is that which they create for themselves 
through their work in geography, arithmetic, and the 
life-career class. 
Extensive codperation between school and employer is 
likely to be the rule, because of the great returns which 
are bound to flow from it. The employer will find a 
better class of workers coming to him, and will note that 
his business has less of its speculative and disappointing 
features, and offers more real satisfaction.!_ The benefits 
to the worker flowing from joint action with school and 
manager will be increased intelligence, better provision 
for education, and improved conditions of employment. 
Finally, to the school the advantages of work with these 
other agencies are patent ; the educational system derives 
from them the points of view necessary to make it of 
real service to the public. 
Coéperation in choosing the Occupation. — The child’s 
choice of occupation should involve, besides the use of 
vocational information already noted, the possibility for 
him to meet and talk with workers already engaged in 
the occupations under consideration. The vocational 
1 This satisfaction is expressed in the title of a recent book, Where 
Garments and Americans are Made. (MacCarthy.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 247 
guide, therefore, should arrange for conferences in which 
the pupils in the life-career classes may question expe- 
rienced adults; he should organize volunteer committees 
after the Birmingham plan. 
The choice of occupation should be the concern of 
the parent almost as much as it is that of the child, and 
the work of the counselor will include many conferences 
with fathers and mothers. At least one large high school, 
that at Pomona, California, has organized a course of 
talks and discussions for the parents, in order that 
their function in guidance may be more intelligently 
understood and performed. Such meetings furnish 
excellent opportunity to interest citizens in the efforts 
of the school to give effective training to the children, 
and to obtain helpful criticism. Besides, such gatherings 
are certain to lead to conferences with individual parents, 
in which the plans for each child may receive the dis- 
cussion, criticism, codperation, and support so necessary 
for the wise choice of a life-career. In some cases the 
vocational counselor must protect the child from 
decisions arbitrarily made and insisted on by the home. 
In many cases the value of more education must be 
clearly shown. Ina large number, hopes and ambitions 
may be encouraged, and means and methods found for 
their realization. In all cases the parents may be 
shown the advantage of keeping the educational op- 
portunity for the child broad, and for prolonging his 
vocational infancy. In all cases, too, the school and 
the home may coéperate in making the most of the
-P-A-G-E-258
  
  248 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
daily opportunities for broadening the child’s knowledge 
and experience.! 
Coéperation in Preparing for the Vocation. — Prepara- 
tion for the vocation, too, will require that the child have 
access to persons of experience, success, and good judg- 
ment, so that he may be able to get first-hand informa- 
tion and advice about the proper method of preparation.” 
1 In view of occasional writings on vocational guidance it cannot be 
too strongly insisted upon that no child should be hurried into the choice 
of an occupation. If coéperation aims to find the child his calling be- 
fore he is ready to choose for himself, then that codperation is ill-advised. 
The forces of school, home, and community should be used rather to fic 
the child, by means of knowledge and concrete experience, so that he 
shall be able to make his own decisions wisely. We have advocated a 
life-career class in the fourth grade; it must not be understood, however, 
that such a class is to be concerned with anything more than laying the 
foundation for wise choices later. It is true that leakages from school 
begin to be serious shortly after the fourth grade, and on this account 
the teacher may find it necessary to give rather definite vocational 
information to those children who threaten to leave school soon. Such 
cases, however, must not be allowed to determine the subject-matter of 
the class; it is better in the long run for the teacher to combat this state 
of affairs (leaving school in the early grades), than to seem to acquiesce 
in it. Future generations of school children must be considered, and 
while for the present some fifth grade children may be forced to take 
what work they can get, the great majority cannot be expected to decide 
wisely until they are close to the twenties, and some not until much later. 
The life-career class in the fourth grade is concerned with laying broad 
foundations for the choice of career, and this actual choice should be 
deferred until the child is fully ready to make it. (Cf. the proposed 
plan for tentative choices of three to five occupations for special study.) 
2 The work of supervising this personal advice is a very important 
duty of the counselor. Some successful men and women are not very 
efficient in helping others to succeed. The advisors should frequently 
be called into conference, and, so far as seems appropriate, the scope 
of their work and their methods as well should be planned by the voca- 
tional counselor and put into printed form. 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 249 
In connection with prevocational and vocational educa- 
tion of whatever sort, the school department should 
organize advisory committees of employers and workers, 
and these committees, each for a particular occupation 
or group of occupations, should aid the school in making 
the training efficient. 
Coéperation in Instituting and Managing Part-time 
Work. — If the vocational training is to take the form 
of part-time work, as no doubt it will in many cases, 
the school authorities will have to make agreements 
with the stores, shops, offices, and factories in which the 
students work. The plans used in Cincinnati and 
Dayton? seem to give satisfaction. In the words of 
Schneider : 
It has been conclusively demonstrated that the school 
and shop can work together if the one common ground will 
be the mutually safe ground of the mental, physical, and 
the moral advancement of those who work. ... The thing 
is being done and is being done satisfactorily (p. 76). 
Good reports come, too, from those in charge of the 
Boston experiments. It is but just that the workers 
already in an industry should also be a party to part- 
time agreements, in order that sudden surpluses of 
workers may be avoided. The school must gather to- 
gether all interested parties, — parents, youth, teachers, 
employers, and representatives of the workers, — and 
must aid them all in formulating agreements which shall 
1See Schneider, Education for, etc., p. 55-57; also Rochester and 
Dayton leaflets.
-P-A-G-E-260
250 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
center their attention on the welfare of the worker, 
and at the same time protect the legitimate interests 
of all concerned. After the part-time work is instituted 
the “ codrdinators ’’ must represent and put into effect 
the codperation between school and occupation. It is 
not difficult to see that if the school can succeed in these 
undertakings, the social effect in the direction of solving 
labor problems will be very great indeed, 
Codperation in Placement. — In Chapter IV, and in 
other places as well, we have discussed the necessity 
for beginning guidance before the child is obliged to leave 
school for work. If a system of vocational guidance 
begins in the school, and early enough to give the child 
some insight and outlook regarding occupations before 
he needs to leave, there can be nothing but approval if 
placement and supervision of employment also form 
parts of the system. As we stated before, however, 
among some people placement has been taken to 
mean the chief if not the whole function of vocational 
guidance. It is undoubtedly an important part, but it 
is likely that more fruitful results in vocational guidance 
will be accomplished in the period of the child’s life 
before he leaves school for work than can be accom- 
plished thereafter. Placement has always been a dis- 
quieting problem, and the entrance of educational and 
philanthropic agencies into the field has not been alto- 
gether a happy one. Just when the merchants and 
manufacturers have about concluded that the fourteen- 
to sixteen-year-old working child is useless to himself 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
    1 
A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 251 
and to the occupation, the placement people come, study 
the child and the job, watch over his entrance into work, 
advise and admonish him, and make of him a tolerable 
success. Thus the merchant or manufacturer is con- 
vinced that his diagnosis was wrong, and becomes 
satisfied to employ children again. It is such considera- 
tions that lead thoughtful social workers to look with 
concern on the vocational guidance which interests 
itself merely in placement and employment supervision. 
In spite of these dangers, however, there is no ques- 
tion but that better methods of finding work are needed. 
What can be done? In the first place, the school should 
coéperate with the employers in finding out about the 
number of persons engaged in each kind of work, and 
the approximate number hired each year. Second, the 
school can ascertain and publish the list of actual present 
vacancies. Third, the counselor can use his influence 
in systematizing and rationalizing the hiring of workers — 
he can coéperate with employment managers’ associa- 
tions, and can aid in writing the specifications of jobs and 
in formulating application blanks and preliminary tests. 
We cannot yet state that the school department should 
maintain an employment agency for minors. No doubt 
public employment agencies will extend their operations, 
until finally the private agency, with all its abuses, will 
be no more. But it may seem best for the municipal 
or state bureau to confine its attention to persons over 
twenty-one years of age, and to leave to the school de- 
partment the employment and supervision of those under
-P-A-G-E-262
    252 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
twenty-one. (At the least the juvenile labor exchange 
should be a separate department from that for the adults.) 
Legislation must soon bring under the school’s supervision 
the working conditions of minors, for an aroused public 
will not long be complaisant with all care devoted to the 
few and with those most exposed to danger allowed to 
shift for themselves. What the nature of the legislation 
should be seems impossible to say ; but we do know that 
there are certain logical next steps which will aid us in 
developing a satisfactory system. For example, the 
work certificate, already required in many cities, is a 
great step in advance. Cincinnati, Boston, and other 
cities now require a new certificate for each new job. 
The first certificate is issued only after the child already 
has the promise of a job. Right here a new step seems 
practicable. Why should not the work certificate 
office have a written copy of the agreement between the 
child and the employer? With this step taken the school 
authorities would be in a much better position to propose 
and finally enforce certain minimum requirements in the 
conditions of employment. 
In the next place, why might not the employer be asked 
to refrain from advertising for persons under twenty-one 
and from sending for them to the private employment 
agencies? If we grant the propriety of asking the child 
to come to the office for a new working certificate, why 
should not we grant the propriety of the employer’s 
being required to notify a school placement bureau 
whenever he has a vacancy to be filled by aminor? If 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
       A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
  255 
this plan seems to be too far-reaching, or if it must be 
introduced gradually, the requirement may be modified 
to the rule that the employer must notify the school 
placement bureau before advertising or sending word 
to other agencies. Through some such plan as this 
proposed, the vocational-guidance bureau could better 
working conditions without on the one hand interfering 
to an unwarranted degree with the business affairs of the 
employer, or on the other hand imposing a paternalistic 
system of job-assignment upon the worker. The em- 
ployer would still be able to select his help, and the worker 
to select his job. But the information about the vacancy 
would be available at the central office, the specifications 
of the job would be known, and the present haphazard 
method of job hunting would be partly brokenup. Fur- 
ther, the plan proposed would very likely prevent much of 
the ‘ job-hoboism ” now caused by the habit of boys and 
girls of going to another job with the blind hope that itmay 
by good luck prove better than the one they now have. 
Coéperation in Employment Supervision. — Codpera- 
tion in employment supervision is essential. Legisla- 
tion or no legislation, the school people can do little 
without the cordial support of the workers and the em- 
ployers. Here are two great tasks to be worked out by 
joint action: the job must be made to serve the highest 
purposes of the boy or girl; and the accessions to industry 
should be made in such a way as to serve rather than to 
interfere with the interests of all concerned. No service 
the school can render is of greater moment.    
  
-P-A-G-E-264
   
    254 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
How can the teacher single-handed begin the solution 
of these problems, without waiting for the inauguration 
of asystem? He may start at any time by following the 
children whom he knows, finding out from them how 
they are getting on in the occupation, and talking with 
their employers and co-workers. Later, if he feels pre- 
pared to extend the work, he may confer with representa- 
tives of labor and with employers, may aid them in 
writing the specifications of certain jobs, may find out 
and advise in regard to ways of promotion, may secure 
advice about the work offered in the school, may ask 
codperation in providing extension courses for children 
at work, and may make an effort to establish and extend 
part-time work. Such codperation should serve to 
improve the vocational guidance both in the school and 
in the occupation, and should pave the way for better 
understanding and efficient joint action beneficial to 
all concerned. 
It is to be noted that we must still provide, in our 
system of employment supervision, for keeping individual 
contact with the worker. This may be done by means 
of volunteer helpers, or in the cities through officers 
stationed in the individual schools in various parts of the 
city. These supervisors or helpers should frequently 
be called into conference to exchange experiences and 
formulate policies. 
Coéperation in Improving Conditions of Labor. — All 
that we have proposed should operate to improve the 
conditions of labor. But what about the larger questions    
-P-A-G-E-265
    
       A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 255 
of industry: unions, steady employment, scientific 
management, adequate wages, opportunity for career, 
industrial democracy? Can the school codperate in 
the solution of these perplexing questions? The answer 
is that it has so codperated and is doing so at the present 
time. The Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Rochester 
trade agreements, the interest of educational people in 
the employment managers’ associations, the joint action 
in the industrial and commercial surveys, the participa- 
tion in the activities of Chambers of Commerce — all 
testify to the effectiveness of the school’s new-found 
interest in the world for which the children are being pre- 
pared. Further, the young people are being taught some- 
thing about the problems of employment, and no doubt, 
when all else is said and done, the training of a new 
generation of workers, prepared to cope intelligently with 
these problems, is the most sane and effective way of 
getting them solved. 
Codperation in Legislation. — Laws which run far 
ahead of public desire or public intelligence are apt to 
give more trouble than they are worth. Hence the need 
for the kind of teaching of which we have just spoken — 
that about the problems of employment. When the 
time is ripe for new steps in legislation, however, the 
school must codperate in bringing these laws to pass. 
In order that the contribution of the school may be 
intelligent and effective, vocational counselors must 
make many connections which give them information 
and influence respected by the lawmakers. Thus, the   
-P-A-G-E-266
   
    256 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
man in charge of the vocational-guidance movement in 
Grand Rapids, Jesse B. Davis, has recently been chosen 
a director of the Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce ; 
this position gives the movement an excellent opportunity 
both to gather information about the practicability of 
desired legislation, and to express and support effectively 
its proposals. . Bloomfield has always kept in touch 
with organizations of employers and employed. The 
counselor should keep himself in touch with many 
kinds of organizations, and should gain their confidence 
and support. 
When legislation is under consideration, the committees 
on education and on industry in the legislature must be 
aided in their work; this should be an important duty 
of the vocational guide. Information should be fur- 
nished the members of the committee about practices 
in other cities and states, the results of investigations 
should be given them in summary fashion, and the 
counselor should be ready to speak before the committee 
effectively. As a preparation for such work wide reading 
and some knowledge of laws will be necessary, and it 
would be well for the vocational-guidance department to 
have facilities for preparing sample laws as suggestions 
to interested members of the legislature. 
It should go without saying that in the preparation of 
bills the counselor needs to codperate with all persons 
in the state interested in the active work of vocational 
guidance, and, most important, that he should whenever 
possible secure the point of view, advice, and active 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
  
  A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 257 
support of all the organizations of employers, workers, 
teachers, and other interested persons. 
We have here attempted to show the main avenues of 
coéperation open to the vocational-guidance movement 
in furthering its work, and to show that without this 
joint action the work would be greatly handicapped. 
We shall now discuss more specifically the conditions 
within the occupations themselves, and shall try to find 
a basis for determining what the relation of the move- 
ment for vocational guidance should be toward them. 
The Improvement of the Conditions of Employment. 
Opportunity for Part-time Work.— The experience 
already furnished by the continuation school indicates 
the values in such training to worker and to employer. 
It is already evident that the continuation-school 
principle might with profit be extended to include much 
more time devoted to school work, and to apply to many 
more workers. We have already proposed a plan for 
errand boys and girls to work at the occupation four 
hours daily and spend four other hours in the work and 
play of school (p. 197). Again, the work of many 
department stores in organizing short courses for adult 
workers indicates what may be done with profit by the 
schools, for workers of all ages. The Boston Continua- 
tion School maintains such voluntary classes, and devotes 
a section of the report to them (Circular, pp. 34-44). 
In instituting continuation classes or part-time work 
great care is needed to make adjustments satisfactory in 
view of the time schedule of the establishments served, 
s 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
258 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
and to supervise the work of the employees. If the half- 
time plan be used for children up to sixteen or seventeen 
years of age, the employer will be forced to deal with 
double the number of individuals he did before, and 
should be aided by the school in every legitimate way. 
Thus, the school may arrange after-hours conferences 
with the children from each establishment, in this way 
doing part of the work of teaching the rules and duties 
of the tasks. Again, a person about to enter a given 
establishment may be put under the preliminary tutelage 
of another person in that establishment. Finally, the 
school may make itself a clearing house for information 
about writing the specifications of jobs, and may aid 
the employment managers of establishments to plan 
their working tasks so carefully that the initiation of a 
beginner and the supervision of a regular worker will 
not present such difficulties as they do now. 
The opportunity for part-time work seems eminently 
desirable; it should serve to free the child from the 
sudden plunge into the occupation, which frequently 
means for him mistakes, misunderstandings, discourage- 
ment, temptations, and failures. Part-time work would 
also make possible a better correlation between the 
school program and the occupational needs of the pupils ; 
this advantage alone seems so promising that it would not 
be surprising to see the part-time plan extend itself till 
it applies to many workers over twenty-one years of age.

Work, vol, 31, No. 4, Feb, 1916, pp. 417-420. See also Thum. 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
    A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 259 
Again, as we have indicated above, it would inevitably 
make possible a better system of employment supervision. 
Its manifold advantages should commend to the coun- 
selor the effort to arrange for a part-time agreement 
whenever it seems necessary for a child to leave school. 
School systems on their part should not be backward 
in readjusting their programs. Boston high schools 
already make it a practice to allow senior girls to spend 
Mondays in the stores. No plea that “ the work of the 
school is interfered with ” should stand in the way of the 
more important duty of holding children under the school 
influence a little longer and preparing them adequately 
for the tasks ahead of them. 
Extending the Work of the Employment Manager. — 
The employment manager of the establishment deals with 
the occupational problems with which the school is most 
concerned. The vocational guide, therefore, whether 
acting as teacher, placement officer, or employment super- 
visor, must do whatever he can (1) to induce firms to put 
the solution of the employment problems in charge of 
some one agent; (2) to help to make the position of the 
employment manager so important that this officer will 
have real influence in determining the policies of the 
establishment; (3) to codperate with the manager in 
connection with the work of employment supervision 
on behalf of the schools; (4) to induce and aid the 
employment managers of a city or metropolitan area to 
study their problems and to improve their methods 
through conferences, visits, and joint action; (§) to   
     
-P-A-G-E-270
  260 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
further the professional training of employment man- 
agers, whether through college courses, business-school 
courses, or private study. 
The Opportunity for a Career in the Occupation. — 
We have shown that Professor Hoxie’s investigations 
led him to the conclusion that scientific management in 
practice has not so far succeeded in choosing for the men 
the tasks best suited to their abilities or in adapting 
the tasks to the workers. We have also seen how one 
progressive plant, under the system of transferring 
workers to tasks better adapted to them, as worked out 
by its employment manager, has been able to secure 
better work and a more contented force. The thing 
most needed in the occupational world, apparently, in 
order to satisfy the desire for advancement, is a mapping 
out of all the jobs in an establishment in such a way that 
paths will lead successively from one to the other in an 
orderly series of promotions. The school exemplifies 
the promotion idea; no doubt the worker wishes it 
to follow him into the occupation. 
To the average factory manager, perhaps this problem 
would seem insoluble. The machinery of the factory — 
the actual machines, we mean — gets in the way of a 
  
      
solution. It is difficult and expensive for the manage- 
ment to teach the profitable operation of many machines 
to any one individual. There never has been, therefore, 
1 Automatic machinery makes this versatility less difficult. In any 
case it must be done, and is done, in many establishments, with profit 
to all concerned. 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
        A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 261 
generally speaking, any line of promotion throughout 
the factory. That would involve teaching, and it has 
usually been assumed that there were two separate com- 
partments — teaching, all in the school, and doing, all 
in the occupation. 
Yet some hints of a better policy have been noted. 
The messenger boys of the London post office are being 
trained to pass examinations for letter carriers1 The 
jobs in the Dennison factory have been put into three 
classes so that the members of the force can prepare them- 
selves for higher kinds of work. And the effort to write 
down the specifications of jobs facilitates comparison : 
the advantages and disadvantages of each job may be 
more readily seen. The system of transfers then aids 
the worker in securing the proper task. 
It is the school’s further duty and right to teach the 
children that they are to take their part in the continuous 
process of improving the vocations. It will be agreed, 
in spite of the apparent difficulties in the way, that in 
time the occupation must relieve the worker of the monot- 
ony of machine-like labor by change of work and rotation 
of tasks; must have a comprehensive plan of promotions 
whereby vacancies in the higher positions can be filled 
by persons occupying those below; must make it easy 
to register complaints and suggestions from the workers ; 
must in many cases progressively shorten the hours of 
labor and raise the wages; must offer opportunities for 
advanced study; must conserve the productive element 
1 Dearle, pp. 377, 378.
-P-A-G-E-272
   
    262 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
as against the mere mechanical in the work-tasks of the 
unskilled? and must somehow make progress toward 
giving the workers a share in determining the rules and 
conditions under which they shall work. Without 
these improvements a “‘ job ’’ can hardly be said to offer a 
“career.” Hence the vocational counselor, whose 
ideal must be an opportunity for a career for every 
worker, is very much concerned with all efforts to carry 
out these proposals. 
Opportunity to use the Land. — The real seriousness 
of the land question in the United States is shown in the 
Manly report for the Commission on Industrial Relations, 
a report whose conclusions have been questioned, but 
whose facts speak for themselves. On pages 127-132 
he treats of ‘The Land Question and the Condition 
of Agricultural Labor,”’ showing the alarming growth 
of tenancy farming, with its wastefulness, extortion, 
debt, discouragement, irresponsibility, concentration of 
wealth, and poverty. In eighty-two Texas counties 
tenants operate on an average sixty per cent of the 
farms. 
Manly recommends the exemption from taxation of 
all improvements and the taxation at full value of un- 
used land. Whether or not the land tax or single-tax plan 
would help to solve the problem, the vocational counselor 
must realize that here is work for him to do, in the study 
of this question and in codperating for its solution. 
Furthermore, the school pupils, especially those who are 
1 See Woods in Bloomfield’s Readings, p. 31.  
-P-A-G-E-273
  A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 263 
considering farming as a vocation, must be informed con- 
cerning this acute problem. 
The amelioration of conditions of labor must go on 
under the patronage of enlightened employers, and at 
the same time the workers must be awakened to deserve 
and require better things. Many forces work for social 
reform, and the vocational-guidance movement must 
codperate with all of them. 
Methods of Guidance. Arousing the Child’s Interest 
in his Career. — It is one thing to guide a child who wants 
help in choosing his career, and quite another to arouse 
a person who shows no interest in the question of his 
vocation. The logic of the recent studies of elimination 
from school is that the child must begin to think about 
his vocation at the fifth grade or earlier. This does not 
mean that he must at once choose a vocation, but rather 
that he should begin thinking about the purposes of 
his_scheeliag_and the-oceupations of his environment. 
We have shown that from earliest years, both in play 
and in studies, he may profitably think much in terms of 
occupations. This should arouse his interest in consider-_ 
ing the part he himself will play in the world. Davis 
says that pupils who take part in s student activities are 
the most desirable when it comes to filling positions in 
the commercial or industrial world;! the counselor 
should foster these organizations of students as a means 
of arousing interest in the life-career. \ t 
Even in the actual life-career class the teacher may

264 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
find pupils little interested in analyzing occupations or 
discovering aptitudes. Bloomfield has suggested then 
that the teacher of a group of city boys might begin 
with an occupation such as that of a professional baseball 
player. Thus, the members of the class might be led to 
draw up the specifications of the job of catcher on a big 
league team: the kind of man wanted, the pay, the 
season, the traveling, the lack of home life, the excite- 
ment, the notoriety, the period of usefulness, the prep- 
aration necessary, the way of entering the occupation, 
and the dozens of other things which the boys will think 
out. The work of the school janitor may be analyzed, 
and then that of the teacher, the conductor, the motor- 
man, the policeman, the actor, and the banker. This 
method follows the interest and common knowledge of 
the children, and it imposes no fixed subject matter and 
outline upon them. What if they do not cover certain 
standard occupations? Better than that, they will have 
a method and an interest which they can apply to any 
situation; these will outlast any amount of mere in- 
formation. 
Having developed the interest of the children, we 
shall need to guide them through the successive steps 
which each individual takes. For convenience we have 
listed these steps as follows: surveying opportunities ; 
choosing the occupation; preparing for the occupation ; 
entering on work; progress and promotion; change 
and readjustment. Between the treatments of the 
first two, as contributing to both if not all of the
-P-A-G-E-275
        A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 265 
steps, we shall interpolate a discussion of the life-career 
class. We turn now to a brief survey of each of 
these fields. 
Guidance in Surveying Opportunities. — Opportunities 
may be considered as being of two kinds: those without, 
as expressed in the offerings which the vocations make; 
and those within, as expressed by the inclinations and 
abilities of the individual. It has been said that voca- 
tional guidance consists in the harmonious adjustment 
and codperation of these two factors. Let us consider 
first the discovery of one’s own powers and interests. 
The burden of Chapter III is that the best vocational 
guidance is that accomplished by means of educational 
guidance. Thus the prevocational plan, or the junior 
high school with a program which includes manual work 
of a practical sort, enables the child to measure himself 
by several kinds of tests, and thereby aids him in finding 
out what his powers and inclinations are. Much of the 
academic work of these schools may be closely related to 
the manual work, the tasks may be set within the powers 
of the child, and he may be given a wide variety of expe- 
riences. Again, student and club activities should be 
encouraged, for through them many pupils find them- 
selves. Every child may be asked the questions: To 
what organizations do you belong? What do you do in 
them? What activities do you like best? How do you 
spend your leisure time? Summer camps, corn clubs, 
junior associations, dramatics, student self-government, 
school papers, debating, bands, and orchestras, — all
-P-A-G-E-276
   
     266 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
should be a part of the educational guidance of school 
children. 
Outside relationships not only show the child some- 
thing about the occupations; they show him his own 
powers besides. Thus, if men and women from the 
occupations, workers and employers, come to the 
school to talk to the classes, especially if the groups are 
small and questions are asked, and if travel trips and 
visits to establishments form part of the school’s 
activities, the vocational imagination will be stirred 
and clews to interests and abilities may be found. 
The child will need more than mere educational advan- 
tages in order to discover his interests and abilities: he 
will need to have the benefit of personal conferences 
about his problems. The teacher should investigate the 
choices which children make, — their choices of studies, 
courses, companions, and schools. Enrollment blanks 
should be filled out anew at least twice each year, and 
on them the child should be asked to fill in his choices 
of occupations, if he has developed any preferences. 
Records of examinations or grades in school studies should 
be put upon cards, together with the other questions 
suggested by the plans outlined above. A record of the 
child’s successes should go with him through the grades. 
The Life-career Class. — The class for the study of 
life careers serves to aid the child to survey his oppor- 
tunities, to decide on his career, and to prepare for his 
vocation. We shall therefore treat it here. 
Should the life-career class be a part of the English  
-P-A-G-E-277
     A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 267 
work? We have discussed in Chapter ITI the relation of 
this work to literature, written composition, and Oral 
English. All of them can be of use in vocational guid- 
ance. But the subject of the vocation is of such moment 
that there are the same objections to making it sub- 
ordinate to any other study that there are to making the 
vocational-guidance department of the city schools a 
subordinate branch of another department. 
What then should be the plan and substance of the 
life-career class in the elementary grades? As low as the 
fourth grade the children can begin to discuss the work 
tasks of the people about them, to bring to the class 
information they have gathered from outside the 
schoolroom, to read and think about simple biographies, 
to analyze the tasks of a few typical occupations, to 
make out as a class exercise the qualities needed in cer- 
tain kinds of work, and each to start a scrapbook of 
information about a group of occupations in which he 
expresses most interest. 
In default of a textbook the teacher may bring out 
by questions and discussions the meaning of the education 
the children are obtaining, the opportunities ahead of 
them, and the value of definite preparation for life. The 
work in the fifth and sixth grades may follow the same 
general plan, the children building up their own knowl- 
edge, and being taught more and more to use outside 
sources of information, and to bring to class and give to 
the others interesting data about occupations. Here 
the collecting interest can be utilized, and a school 
    
-P-A-G-E-278
   
    268 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
museum started, made up of both ephemeral and per- 
manent material. Business circulars, time-tables, mail- 
order catalogues, newspaper clippings, and magazine 
articles can be used, and a notebook devoted to written 
material, clippings, and pictures may be constructed 
by each pupil. The members of the class should have 
access to books on occupations, handy books for boys 
and girls, and simple written biographies, and the teacher 
should guide the children in their reading. 
In the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades more system- 
atic work can be done, though substantially the same 
methods may be followed. The teacher here may lead 
the children into wider experiences, if they are interested 
in the work, and may make a general survey of the field 
of occupations. Further, the children in these inter- 
mediate grades can begin to consider two things more 
seriously: the value of continuing with their education 
through the high-school age, and the systematic and 
wise choice of a vocation. In connection with the 
question of high school, visits may be arranged, and 
every effort should be made to give whatever personal 
counsel seems appropriate. There should in time be 
prepared a simple textbook for the life-career class of the 
intermediate grades, with its material well within the 
comprehension of the children, but serving as sub- 
stance for solid study. 
With the high school age a good textbook would be of 
great help, and there is need for definiteness of outline 
in the work of the class.  
-P-A-G-E-279
     A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 269 
There are three kinds of books about occupations which 
the teacher should avoid in choosing texts for the life- 
career class: (z) many of those written by successful 
men and women about their own occupations; (2) those 
which substitute for solid facts irrelevant pictures and 
claptrap; (3) those hurriedly and carelessly gotten to- 
gether. Successful men and women of the past genera- 
tion are frequently disqualified for two reasons from 
telling the next generation how to succeed. First, the 
methods in business and industry, and in many pro- 
fessions, and the ethical standards as well, have changed 
and are now changing so radically that the boy or girl 
who copies these methods has little guarantee that 
satisfactory results will follow. Second, the successful 
man or woman is likely to treat his subject in a personal, 
restricted way, to emphasize too strongly the obstacles 
overcome, and to paint in too bright colors the heights 
of attainment reached. In regard to the second and 
third classes of textbooks noted above, those which are 
overenthusiastic and those which are hurriedly put 
together, we need not point out the dangers in their use. 
The class in vocations should be as serious in its sub- 
ject-matter, methods, and requirements as any other 
class, and nothing but the best should be used as text 
and reference books. 
The textbook should be supplied with exercises and 
suggestive questions, and should provide for the study 
of printed matter, visits, interviews, original investiga- 
tions, reports, discussions, and debates. It should 
    
-P-A-G-E-280
    
         270 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
candidly state the difficulties and problems in the occu- 
pations, and should touch upon the social and economic 
questions necessary to be understood. It should be 
free from sentimentalism and other objectionable 
subject-matter. Three or four good books to cover the 
commercial, industrial, and professional occupations 
should be used as supplementary texts, and the books 
selected should have been written with the modern 
vocational-guidance point of view in mind. 
In the high school age the pupils will be able to profit 
by detailed analyses of the occupations, and by analyses 
and examinations of their own characteristics as measured 
by concrete requirements. 
The college also should maintain a life-career class, 
for college students do much thinking on the perplexing 
question, What shall I do?? 
In all the life-career classes, whether in elementary 
school or college, the teacher should keep a personal 
record card for each student. On this card should be 
noted all facts and opinions which indicate strong in- 
terests and definite forms of ability. 
Guidance in Choosing the Occupation. — On pages 
125-128 we have indicated some of the principles that 
should govern the choice of a vocation. We shall here 
note some additional observations to be considered in 
making choices. 
Too much emphasis should not be put upon the matter 
1See Elliff; and also Jennings, who shows the need for a college 
vocational bureau, and outlines a plan.     
 
-P-A-G-E-281
    
         A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 271 
of choice. Like the overemphasis placed on securing 
the first job, this tends to obscure the real problems — 
what the child is doing to succeed in his present tasks, 
what he is going to do after choice, and whether the choice 
turns out to be a wise one. Neither should the child be 
asked to decide too soon; if he is occupying his time in 
ways profitable to himself and those about him he may 
well be allowed to take his time. It would be a perfectly 
feasible proposition for a student to spend time preparing 
for several related occupations, and to continue while 
actually working the study of the one finally chosen. 
Another matter for careful consideration of the 
counselor is the temptation upon him to encourage the 
brighter boys and girls to go into the professions, or at 
least to prepare_themselves for a “ clean-collar job.” 
Are not these aims and ambitions often based on a false 
ideal of labor, honor, and position? Should not working 
conditions and our conceptions of labor be reorganized 
to give as good a basis for usefulness and happiness on 
the farm and in the shop as at the bar and in the pulpit? 
It would seem to be a far safer thing to do to train 
every person to a trade than to train every one to a pro- 
fession. It has often been remarked that some men do 
not consider themselves quite respectable until they 
have at least failed at a profession. The_counselor 
can combat these notions by telling about the struggles 
for success.and the low average earnings in-the professions, 
and the attractive opportunities in other fields, provided 
one will thoroughly prepare himself for the work. What-

          272 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
ever be the future revision of thought and practice in 
these directions, the shop work of the prévocational 
school, where all the boys meet in overalls and join in 
productive labor, should have its influence for good. 
The teacher, too, can aid the spread_of.a_better_ attitude 
toward labor, particularly, perhaps, by joining with the 
boys in the work of caring for the athletic field and the 
running track.) If the teacher of Latin will occasionally 
take off his coat and help rake the track or dig up the 
jumping pit, the boys and girls of the school may be set 
to thinking some thoughts they might otherwise miss.1 
In the whole problem of the choice of an occupation, 
breadth of education and of experience is the main thing 
to look out for. (The nearer the school can come to the 
concrete situations of life, especially in the upper grades 
of the elementary school and in the high school, the 
better. 
The child should be encouraged to aim at the position 
which will give most satisfaction to his interests and use 
most effectively his powers. At the same time, however, 
he should be trained to self-reliant usefulness at his 
present stage of preparation, so that he could take 
care of himself whenever the necessity should arise. 
Guidance in Preparing for the Occupation. — On pages 
90-92 we have sketched the main principles one may 
follow in preparing for his vocation. Our plan involves 
1 Women in apartment houses are sometimes quite thoughtless of 
the rights and feelings of the janitor or of tradespeople who serve them. 
The reason seems to be that they have never done any of that kind of 
work themselves and cannot put themselves in the other person’s place.
-P-A-G-E-283
    
A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 273 
breadth of preparation, so that avenues to other possible 
vocations will not be closed; the study of schools, to 
select wisely; study of the occupation; part-time 
experience, if advisable; and the related preparation for 
civic, social, political, and domestic duties.1 
Sometimes vocational education will have to be 
obtained while the boy or girl is working at a blind-alley 
job, and here the continuation school is important. 
School systems apparently will have to require continua- 
tion school opportunities far beyond the age of sixteen, 
for it has been found that the sixteen-year-old child is 
frequently not ready to decide on his vocation. Day 
schooling, whenever possible, should be allowed the 
worker; and night vocational training should be offered 
to those who cannot attend the day classes. The con- 
tinuation hours may be extended until they are sufficient 
to make the work correspond to what we now call part- 
time schooling, with approximately half of each school 
day spent in school. If the worker is in a blind-alley 
job, our effort must be to make his present work efficient 
and to prepare him to leave it for something better; 
if he is in promising work, we may make the schooling 
supplement the occupational experiences and prepare the 
worker for advancement. 
The school, too, should arrange for systematic vo- 
cational guidance, so that each boy or girl will have the 
1Tt should be more widely recognized that just as the girl has to 
make a double preparation, for vocation and for home-making, so the 
boy has certain things to learn about his duty as a successful life-partner. 
T
-P-A-G-E-284
274 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
benefit of a lasting acquaintance and friendship with an 
experienced counselor, and, if possible, also with some 
person of experience and good judgment who has already 
succeeded in the vocation chosen by the student. The 
counselor or coérdinator should supervise the employ- 
ment of the children he is guiding, so that he may follow 
their progress outside the school. 
No part of the training for the vocation is of greater 
importance than the study of industrial and commercial 
conditions. This study is likely to be much more con- 
crete and valuable after the boy or girl has chosen his 
occupation than before. With his vocation decided 
upon, sociology, economics, commercial geography, 
business organization, industrial history, and community 
civics take on definite applications. The teacher must 
keep himself informed on current events and bring them 
into his classes and his vocational guidance in a way to 
interest the pupils. Thrift should be discussed, as 
affording opportunity for advanced study, travel, and 
business on one’s own account.!. Some of the perplexing 
questions of our industrial and commercial life may 
profitably be brought to the attention of the students, 
and they may try their powers at answering them. 
The same concreteness may be given other studies 
after the vocation is chosen; it is for this reason that 
Eliot favors tentative choices at early ages.? Children 
should be shown the importance of ability to talk well, 
1 See Prichard and Turkington, Stories of Thrift, 
2 See Readings, p. 9. 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
    A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 275 
and to make freehand drawings. History, literature, 
chemistry, physics, languages, music, and art may be 
taught as aiding the vocation and as helping to make a 
well-rounded life. The study of family budgets may 
give both boys and girls good training in domestic 
economy. 
Finally, the student and club activities, the summer 
camps, and the recreations will give the young people 
practice in codperation, leadership, and the solution of 
concrete problems of adjustment to each other and to the 
environment. Without such training the preparation 
for the vocation would be incomplete. 
Guidance in Entering upon Work. — We have proposed 
(p. 252) that the school authorities supervise the employ- 
ment of all workers under the age of twenty-one, and that 
employers be required to notify the vocational-guidance 
department whenever a vacancy is to be filled. There 
is no doubt but that an adequate system of guidance must 
make some provision for the perplexing problem of 
getting work. Yet the unsatisfactory features of place- 
ment are many (pp. 109-114, 250). It seems possible 
that more good would be done if the money now spent 
in placing children were expended in an effort to keep 
them in school longer. If the school age can be raised, 
and if children can be given adequate training before the 
time for placement comes, —in knowledge of occupa- 
tions, information about the problems with which they 
will have to cope, and training in effective speaking, — 
it seems possible that the young people might find their
-P-A-G-E-286
276 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
own places. With the registration of vacancies advo- 
cated above, this would not mean wandering the streets 
looking for work, but rather calling at certain listed 
establishments. 
At some time the worker must learn to stand on his own 
feet in the occupational world,—to make his own 
adjustments. No system of vocational guidance should 
delay the coming of independent action, provided the 
child is capable. Until the child is better equipped for 
seeking work, and until his sources of information are 
better, it may be necessary for the school system to 
maintain a placement bureau or to make placement 
work incidental to vocational guidance. 
Guidance in Progress and Promotion. — Our plan for 
employment supervision (or for coérdinators in part- 
time work) would furnish each child with an experienced 
friend as a volunteer helper, and with close contact with 
a vocational counselor as well. From these persons, 
as well as from his employer, he may obtain advice 
and guidance about his progress and promotion in the 
occupation. 
The school department must maintain many kinds of 
classes for advanced training: evening classes, short 
courses, part-time work, extension courses, continuation- 
school work, factory and store schools, and summer and 
dull-season courses, and these classes must cover a wide 
range of subjects, both academic and vocational. The 
Minneapolis Survey report discusses the unsatisfactory 
nature of correspondence courses (pp. 116-121), and 
   
-P-A-G-E-287
A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 277 
the schools must find a substitute. In Richmond, 
classes of workers were gathered together first, and the 
studies which were to be offered were determined after- 
ward.! 
Guidance in Change and Readjustment. — In Myer’s 
monograph on the Problems of Vocational Education in 
Germany (p. 11) are pointed out the evils of a system 
in which there is no possibility of transfer from an un- 
skilled to a skilled occupation. Ambition and hope are 
cut off, and even the continuation-school work becomes 
sordid and inefficient. Obviously, such a state of affairs 
should have no place in a democratic commonwealth. 
Aside from the bad effect on the individual, it would 
be a source of danger to the state. 
Pending the time when industry and commerce are 
organized to provide for a system of promotions through- 
out the establishment, the vocational guide or his agents, 
the volunteer helper or employment supervisor, must 
aid the worker in making whatever changes and read- 
justments seem beneficial. The worker must have 
access to these disinterested sources of advice. If the 
job is a “ blind ” one, the public and the employer must 
be taught to look upon it as a temporary place, and 
must learn to encourage and facilitate change. During 
the probation period at the unskilled trade, the employ- 
ment supervisor should study the boy or girl, making 
inquiries of his employers, parents, and co-workers, and 
should keep a record of all available significant informa- 
1See 1915 Bureau of Educ. Report, Part. I, p. 260. 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  278 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
tion. The worker, on his part, must be taught to give 
satisfaction in whatever position he finds himself, to 
make himself worthy of a change, to aid the: counselor 
and respond to his help, to be on the lookout for a better 
place, and to be patient till a better opportunity comes. 
He must be taught that he should not leave. one place 
until he has another in view, unless for good cause, and 
that in all his business dealings he should apply the 
Golden Rule. 
What shall the vocational counselor do with the worker 
who wants none of his help or advice? Obviously, let 
him alone. Vocational guidance should never be com- 
pulsory ; if it ever becomes so its chief value to society 
and to the individual is gone. Of course, there are 
certain minimum requirements for the child’s schooling, 
working age, hours of work, wages, and other laws, 
both civil and criminal; these must be enforced. Aside 
from these the worker should be free to solve his own 
problems. In this complex world, however, no one lives 
to himself, and no person can make progress in his 
occupation without the aid and coéperation of others. 
The purpose of vocational guidance is but to systematize 
and direct this aid and coéperation. The worker who 
wishes to be independent of this organized help should 
be allowed to have his way. Independence may 
profitably be encouraged; a better way may be 
developed, or, if not, helpful lessons will be learned, even 
through hard experiences, — lessons which might not be 
learned in any other manner. 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
    
A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 279 
Summary of Methods of Guidance. — The means at 
the disposal of the vocational-guidance movement are, 
then, as follows: the teacher; the trained counselor; 
the volunteer helper; the codrdinator; the employ- 
ment supervisor; the librarian; the employer; the 
employment manager ; civic associations ; labor unions; 
employers’ organizations; the “‘ vocationalized ”’ school 
program; the prevocational school; the continuation 
and part-time plan; the life-career class; the student 
activities. 
The method of vocational guidance concerns itself with 
a school program rich and varied enough to aid in dis- 
covering the interests and powers of the child; surveys 
of occupations; the child’s study of occupations and 
employment problems; and the advice and guidance 
of a trained counselor. 
Training for Vocational Guidance. Normal School 
Classes. —If these methods are to be followed by 
teachers and others, and if the efficient means are to be 
provided, the work must be undertaken by men and 
women who are trained for it, and normal school and 
college courses must be provided for aiding in the 
training. 
In the normal school two courses may profitably be 
given, to be required during the last two years of the 
school program. The first course should give the voca- 
tional-guidance point of view, by centering the atten- 
tion on a study of the vocational possibilities in the 
studies and other activities of the elementary school.
-P-A-G-E-290
    280 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
One after another each of the various studies of the 
program may be considered, and its content and appro- 
priate method examined in relation to the children 
from the kindergarten through the eighth grade. This 
examination should direct the attention of the normal 
school students to the occupations to which the elemen- 
tary school studies should be related. Next the pupils’ 
activities should be examined — athletics, dramatics, 
excursions, music, scouting, clubs, camps, vacation work, 
pleasures, and play —for the purpose of determining 
what vocational utility they possess. Finally, the 
elements in the choice of high schools and the reasons 
for further training should be considered, so that the 
prospective teacher may aid the pupil in continuing his 
education. 
The work of the second or advanced course should 
take up as its central study the problem of the life- 
career class in the elementary school, — its content, aims, 
and methods. In connection with the work there should 
be a consideration of occupational study and of the prob- 
lems of employment (with as much concrete observa- 
tion as seems possible), a study of the means of actually 
preparing for the vocation, and an opportunity for 
experience in conducting life-career classes in the practice 
school, and in counseling individuals, all under super- 
vision and instruction. 
College Classes in Vocational Guidance. — The college 
courses in vocational guidance should provide at least 
for three classes of persons: (1) those who expect to 
   
-P-A-G-E-291
    A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 281 
become high school teachers of ordinary subjects, and 
wish to obtain the vocational-guidance point of view; 
(2) those who have had school experience, and wish to 
lead life-career classes and become vocational coun- 
selors; (3) those who are or expect to be supervisors or 
administrators, and wish to learn how to foster the 
vocational-guidance movement in their schools or school 
systems. 
The first group — prospective teachers of the various 
high school subjects — may follow a plan similar to that 
outlined above for the beginning class in the normal 
school, dealing now, of course, with high school subjects. 
Since this group will ordinarily consist largely of college 
seniors and graduate students, there may be some 
consideration of the problem of the life-career class in 
high-school education for the vocation, problems of 
employment, and plans for codperation between school 
and occupation. : 
The second group, prospective counselors, may prof- 
itably take the work as outlined above for the first group, 
and, in an advanced course, may consider in more detail 
the various problems with which vocational guidance 
must deal. Here each student should select a question 
for his own investigation on which he will report from 
time to time, and the class work should supplement these 
topics so that the members of the group will gain a view 
of most of the important problems in the field. Observa- 
tion visits should be arranged, and, if possible, actual

  282 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
For the third group, supervisors and administrators, 
there should be provided a general course which will 
consider many of the topics of the other two courses 
but will especially take up the question of organizing 
the work of guidance. Thus, the question of educational 
guidance should be discussed, together with a general 
survey of the methods used in various school systems for 
arranging for and financing vocational guidance, and 
the methods of counseling used. Observational visits, 
participation in guidance, and the individual study of 
problems may form part of the work of the course. 
The Equipment of the Vocational Counselor. — 
Students in any of these normal-school or college courses 
who manifest a purpose to choose vocational counseling 
or related work in guidance as their life-careers, should 
of course be given special attention by the instructor. 
Early in the course a study should be made of the present 
equipment of each of such students: his schooling; the 
breadth of his experience in teaching; his knowledge of 
the various studies of the school program; his interest 
in and connection with the play and games of pupils; 
the scope and intensity of his experience in the occu- 
pations; his knowledge of ways and means of finding 
points of contact with commerce and industry; his 
grasp of sociology and economics; his ability to use 
statistical methods; his power to make investigations 
on his own account; his ability to coéperate with 
people ; his purposes in going into the work of voca- 
tional guidance; and his conceptions of the duties and 
     
-P-A-G-E-293
    A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 283 
opportunities of the work. The study in the university 
course should then be made to supplement this pre- 
liminary equipment. 
Breadth of equipment is important, for the counselor 
must meet, understand, be understood by, and confer 
successfully with the employment manager, the mer- 
chant, the manufacturer, the shop superintendent, the 
labor union agent, the worker, the legislator, the superin- 
tendent of schools, the principal, the teacher, the parent, 
and, very likely, groups of any or all of these persons 
assembled in meetings. It is particularly important, 
therefore, that the training course should somehow bring 
the student into contact with the kinds of persons 
with whom he will have to deal in his work. 
Summary of the Program of Vocational Guidance. — 
We may here set forth in summary form the requirements 
in an adequate program of vocational guidance somewhat 
as follows: 
1. A school organization and program broad, varied, and 
flexible enough to be fairly representative of all the activities 
of life, and intensive enough to test the powers of the pupil 
and discover to himself and to others his special inclinations 
and abilities. 
2. A course of study, in every subject, which relates 
itself whenever possible to the vocational needs of the pupils. 
3. A life-career class in every school grade (from the 
fourth up) and in college, studying the opportunity furnished 
by education, the requirements and opportunities of the 
occupations, and the economic and social problems of em 
ployment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  284 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
4. Individual counsel for every child, as often as may 
seem appropriate. Record cards and conferences with 
parents and others would make the work of counseling more 
efficient. 
5. The organization, under one officer responsible di- 
rectly to the superintendent of schools, of all the vocational- 
guidance activities of the schools. 
6. Coéperation of school and other agencies, local, state, 
and national, for the collection and dissemination of occupa- 
tional information. 
7. The supervision, by school authorities, and under 
the direction of the vocational-guidance department, of the 
employment of all workers under twenty-one years of age, 
with liberal opportunity for part-time work. 
8. Adequate vocational training, both for pupils in 
school and for persons at work. 
9. The progressive improvement of commerce and in- 
dustry, by 
(a) The elimination of young workers from full-time employment. 
(6) Employment supervision, through employment managers 
codperating with school agents. 
(©) Better methods of obtaining work. 
(d) Graded systems of promotion, all furnishing prospect of 
satisfactory careers in the occupations. 
(e) Relief from long hours, enervating tasks, dangerous work, 
and low wages. 
(f) Opportunity to obtain the use of idle land and unused or 
exploited natural resources. 
(g) Well-considered progress toward a more democratic ad- 
ministration of those affairs in industry and commerce which 
1 It is difficult to set up a rule here, but it would seem that a friendly 
conversation each half-year, to discuss plans, progress, schooling, play, 
and vocational hopes, might be proposed as a minimum for counseling 
each child in the upper grades. 
   
-P-A-G-E-295
    A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 285 
concern the welfare of the workers, with preliminary training of 
the workers for assuming such responsibilities. 
to. Preparation of men and women for the work of 
vocational guidance. 
11. A legislative program, permissive at first, if it seems 
best, to bring into effect the above requirements, whenever 
better laws will aid. 
Some Appropriate Next Steps. — The above program 
may seem rather formidable; therefore we shall consider 
here some lesser steps which may be taken to further 
the work of vocational guidance, — steps which seem 
appropriate, practicable, and every way desirable. For 
convenience we shall set these also in summary form: 
1. A systematic attempt, through reading circles, talks, 
lectures, discussions, and extension courses, to interest the 
teachers in developing the vocational values in the school 
studies, and in counseling individuals about their vocational 
opportunities. 
2. Differentiation of school program in the seventh and 
eighth grades, by the introduction of a variety of prevoca- 
tional work. 
3. The further development of the many present plans 
and practices for vocational education. 
4. Codperation between school and employers for the 
extension of the half-time or part-time principle. 
5. The appointment and training of selected teachers for 
special work in investigation and counseling, and the assign- 
ment to them of time to do the work. 
6. In lieu of a full course in life-careers, the undertaking 
of such work in the classes in composition, oral English, 
geography, civics, etc.
-P-A-G-E-296
  286 THE VOCATIONAL-GUIDANCE MOVEMENT 
7. The organization of a committee of counselors, with 
an elected or appointed chairman, to supervise and systema- 
tize the work, and to collect and disseminate information. 
8. An investigation of the causes of leaving school, and 
of the working experiences of those who have recently left. 
g. An attempt, in normal school and college courses, 
either in general education classes or in vocational-guidance 
classes, to show to all prospective teachers the vocational 
possibilities in the school program, and to offer training for 
vocational guidance. 
1o. The study, on the part of teachers, of the problems 
and conditions of employment. 
11. Experiments, by city, state, and federal departments, 
in preparing workers for democratic management of such 
institutions as the post office, the forestry service, and schools, 
for the purpose of stimulating similar experiments in industry 
and commerce. 
12. Legislation to cover the following points: 
(a). The setting aside of definite funds for extending the work 
of vocational guidance. 
(b) Raising the school age for full-time schooling, and for part- 
time schooling for wage earners. 
(c) Giving to the school the responsibility for the supervision 
of all children up to the age of eighteen, whether working or not. 
(@d Establishment of public employment agencies and labor 
exchanges. 
Conclusion. — If we consider the progress that has 
been made in school and in occupation during the past 
decade, during the life of the modern vocational-guidance 
movement, it will not seem much to set ourselves to the 
accomplishment of this program. Enlightenment almost 
of itself brings progress, and the critical knowledge of 
   
-P-A-G-E-297
    A PROGRAM FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 287 
school and occupation which has recently come to 
teachers and others through this movement for the con- 
servation of the careers of the children is certain to lead 
to the greater usefulness of the school and to more 
satisfactory conditions in employment. 
The teacher and the counselor are directly concerned, 
of course, with making the best attempt they can to 
guide the individual boy or girl through the school and 
into his chosen occupation. In this process, however, 
we see that our work is not as effective as it might be if 
schools and industrial and commercial conditions were 
improved. Vocational guidance is indeed occupied with 
aiding the individual to make the most of his powers; 
but this we find we cannot do without better schools and 
better work. The welfare of the individual citizen 
and of the state demands the progressive realization of 
these hopes.

SPECIAL GLOSSARY 
Blind Alley: A job or occupation which offers little opportunity 
for growth in skill or knowledge, advancement, or extension 
of usefulness with consequent increase of earning power and 
which does not usually lead to a better occupation. 
Commercial Occupation: A calling which is concerned with busi- 
ness or mercantile affairs. Usually includes clerical occu- 
pations as well, and sometimes the callings connected with 
transportation. 
Continuation School: A school for adolescents or others at work, 
in which they may have day instruction, during working 
hours, either upon the work they are doing or upon matters 
of general value. See Schneider, p. 57; also coédperative 
schooling, below. 
Codperative Schooling: A plan in which the time of the individual 
pupil is divided between shop or store and school ; ¢.g. workers 
paired so that they alternate, one having a week in school 
while the other is at work. School and employer codperate 
in the agreements. Same as part-time schooling. See

  APPENDIX III 
PROBLEMS AND QUESTIONS 
Chapter I: Problems of Vocational Guidance 
1. Do you think that cultural or moral ideals are likely to be 
neglected if the child begins to think about his vocational future? 
Give reasons. 
2. Justify or refute the statement of a recent commencement 
orator, that the purpose of the high school is to keep boys and 
girls from thinking about making a living. 
3. Criticise the statement, attributed to a college dean, that 
when a student begins to select courses with his future occupation 
in mind, at that moment his education ends. 
4. Discuss the difference between education and training, 
with illustrations. Do they work together, or separately ? 
5. If vocational guidance is so much needed, how do you 
account for the indifference of teachers, principals, and superin- 
tendents? 
6. Draw up a statement to show the need for vocational 
guidance in your community. Make it concrete and compre- 
hensive. Direct it at one of the following: your principal; your 
superintendent of schools; the board of education; a teachers’ 
association; a women’s club; a chamber of commerce or board 
of trade; a labor union; a legislative body. 
7. What methods can you propose for doing away with the 
erroneous guidance of magazine advertisements? 
8. Interview a person of educational, industrial, or commer- 
cial importance, for the purpose of finding out his attitude toward 
vocational guidance. Report the result to the class. 
9. How do you think it has happened that the act of place- 
ment seems to some persons to express the chief function of the 
vocational-guidance movement ? 
319 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  PROBLEMS AND QUESTIONS 3Ir 
to. Show how placement, if well done, would inevitably lead 
to other activities in guidance. 
11. Can you see any objection to the statement that the kernel 
of truth in the vocational-guidance movement is vocational edu- 
cation? What would be the dangers involved in vocational 
education without vocational guidance? 
12. Do youindorse Van Sickle’s statement on page 14? Would 
vocational guidance in a school endanger the cultural studies? 
If so, how may this difficulty be avoided? 
13. Certain other names have been suggested, to take the place 
of vocational guidance. Study the expressions here given, using the 
dictionary, and reach a conclusion which satisfies you. Be prepared 
to criticise each suggested name, and to defend your preference. 
Occupational guidance. 
Occupational direction. 
Vocational direction. 
Vocational enlightenment.

apparent physical handicaps in their occupational progress. If 
convenient, bring direct testimony and opinion in these matters 
to class. 
12. Have you ever heard of any way to determine “native

PROBLEMS AND QUESTIONS 319 
7. In view of the fact that children can rarely obtain really 
good jobs, do you feel that this is an argument for keeping them 
out of all employment, or for organizing a plan to make these 
first jobs stepping stones to better positions ? 
8. Outline a good plan for helping a boy or girl to understand 
the duties of a position. Do you think business firms are definite 
enough in instructions to beginners? Is the indefiniteness which 
exists due to mere neglect, or to other reasons? 
9. Consult an employment manager of a progressive firm, 
and report what he has to say on the problem of juvenile labor. 
ro. Schneider says that school people claim that employers 
would be unwilling to organize their juvenile help on a part-time 
plan; he says, too, that employers claim that the school people 
would be the obstructors. What is your opinion in this matter? 
If possible, gather some evidence.

labor problems? Give reasons and instances. 
2. Why is it necessary for counselors to understand scientific 
management ?

ing; breaking in new workmen; tendencies toward a more demo- 
cratic management. 
 
-P-A-G-E-330

worker are identical. Even if this be so, are the problems of each 
the same? Discuss these questions. 
9. What kind of guidance do you think is necessary for 
persons seeking work? What is the difference between an em- 
ployment bureau and a labor exchange? Should the problem of 
juvenile help be kept separate from adult employment? What 
part in the process of securing employment should the worker 
himself take? How should young girls secure employment ? 
to. During active periods of labor what steps need to be taken 
to provide against unemployment in dull times?

the farmer; farm mortgages; attitude of various political parties 
toward labor problems; workingmen’s compensation; old age 
pensions; conciliation and arbitration; profit-sharing; welfare 
work. 
16. Suppose a boy of sixteen to eighteen years is about to 
become an operative in a large factory which is run on the scien- 
tific-management plan. Write him a brief statement concerning

  PROBLEMS AND QUESTIONS 321 
17. Suppose a young man asks you whether or not he should 
join the union. What reply would you give him? 
18. A man interested in employment problems states that no 
one should be employed unless he can earn a living wage. He 
says that in that case the education, training, or care of the un- 
employed would become a social problem, “as it should be,” and 
that ‘‘poverty would be driven out into the open” where it can 
be cured. Discuss this point of view. 
19. Do you think that a firm profits most from a given sum 
invested in cheap labor or in expensive? Give illustrations and 
reasons.

a plan for your city. 
15. Prepare a blank card to be signed by the employer before 
a working certificate is issued. 
16. Cincinnati data seem to show that those young workers 
who finally secure best positions are those who have changed their 
jobs one or more times during the year. Is there an educative 
value in changing jobs? Why? How should it be safeguarded?

REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DepaRTMENT OF THE InTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epucartion, 
Washington, June 8, 1915. 
Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith the report of the Com- 
missioner of Education for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1914, to be 
published in two volumes. The first volume of this report will con- 
tain a brief interpretative review of the progress of education in the 
United States within the year and a still briefer report of the most 
important phases of progress in education in foreign countries. The 
second volume will contain statistics of education for the year within 
the United States. Neither part of the first volume is as complete 
as it should be; several important topics of education in this country 
have been omitted because the bureau had on its staff no specialists 
in these departments and had no funds with which to employ other 
persons to write these chapters. The report from other countries can 
never be made as complete as it should be until the bureau has more 
experts in foreign school systems, a much larger corps of translators, 
funds to pay the expenses of investigations in foreign countries, and 
reasonable stipends to expert correspondents. It is not necessary to 
emphasize the importance of having once each year a complete and 
accurate interpretative survey of all important work in education in 
all parts of the world. Without it we may not hope to obtain the best 
results from our systems of schools and other agencies of education 
nor to obtain the fullest results from the money invested in them. 
Every problem in education has come to be international. The work 
of the humblest district school should be done in the light of all the 
knowledge of education the world has been able to gain. The statis- 
tics of the second volume can never be made complete and accurate 
until it is made possible for the bureau to send expert statisticians 
to State and city education offices and to the several institutions 
of learning of which reports are made. I know of no other agency 
that attempts to compile accurately so large a body of important 
statistics without such expert agents in the field. 
That the tendency toward democracy in education for the service 
of democratic, political, civic, social, and industrial life continues is 
shown clearly by the several chapters of this report. In this country - 
we shall never be satisfied until we have assured to each child that 
kind and degree of education necessary for the fullest and most per- 
fect development of its humanity, for the complete life of manhood

or womanhood, for the intelligent performance of the duties of citi- 
zenship, and for making an honest living by intelligent and skilled 
labor of some kind. A desire for such education for all the children 
of all the people is growing more or less rapidly in all countries of the 
world. At last the world is beginning to understand that all children, 
whatever their birth or condition, have certain rights which become 
obligations for society and state, and that chief among these is the 
right of education. The world is also becoming conscious of the fact 
that neither society nor state can ever attain to its best until every 
individual unit of it has attained unto its best. The first duty of a 
democratic state certainly is to provide equal and full opportunity 
of education for all its children. 
WORK OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
The work of the bureau is itself not an unimportant part of the 
educational life of the country. More and more do education offi- 
cers, teachers, and people look to it for information, advice, and help 
in working out their problems and promoting education in all its 
forms. For this reason they are interested in its organization, sup- 
port, purposes, and work. In the near future I purpose to submit 
for publication a manuscript covering in detail the first three items. 
A brief account of some of the more important features of its devel- 
opment and work for the fiscal year covered by this report follows 
as a part of this introduction. To this are appended the recommen- 
dations contained in the Statement of the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion to the Secretary of the Interior for the fiscal year ended June 
30, 1914. . 
Within the year two new divisions were established, the Division 
of Civic Education and the Division of Education of Immigrants; 
the first in cooperation with the National Municipal League, the 
second in cooperation with the North American Civic League. The 
Division of Home Education, maintained in cooperation with the 
National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations, was 
enlarged. Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, there have 
been established two other divisions: The Division of Vocational 
Education, including trade and industries, with one specialist, and 
education for home-making with two specialists, and the Division of 
School and Home Gardening with three specialists. In the main- 
tenanee of the School and Home Gardening Division the bureau has 
the cooperation of the International Child Welfare League. The 
Division of Rural Education was enlarged by the addition of one 
specialist within the fiscal year covered by this report, and has been 
further enlarged within the current fiscal year by the addition of 
two assistants. There have also been added within the current fiscal 
year a translator and four clerks. These additions to the working force 
of the bureau within the current fiscal year were made possible by an,

increase of $30,600 in the annual appropriations made by Congress 
for its support. 
The Division of Higher Education studied recent developments in 
the universities of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales; the prep- 
aration of teachers for secondary schools in Germany, France, .and 
England; science teaching in the secondary schools of the United 
States; and standards of universities, colleges, normal schools, and 
secondary schools in the United States. A representative of the 
bureau spent one or more weeks at each of the more important univer- 
sities of the British Isles. Dr. Charles H. Judd, of the school of educa- 
tion, University of Chicago, who held the position of specialist in higher 
education for several months at the beginning of the fiscal year, visited 
schools for the preparation of secondary teachers in Germany, France, 
and England, and made a careful investigation of their courses of 
study, both academic and professional, and of their examinations and 
standards of qualification. Dr. Otis W. Caldwell, of the University 
of Chicago, held a temporary appointment in the division, and made a 
personal inspection of the teaching of science in some of the more im- 
portant schools in the Southern States. Dr. S. P. Capen, of Clark 
University, was appointed specialist in higher education and assigned 
to this division as chief of the division February 1, 1914. Before the 
end of the fiscal year he visited and inspected 29 colleges and univer- 
Sities; at the request of The Adjutant General of the War Department, 
he rendered a decision as to the eligibility of about 350 universities, 
colleges, and schools for inclusion in the list of institutions to be 
accredited by the United States Military Academy; and he attended 
and took part in ten educational conferences of associations interested 
in higher education. In person or by correspondence he con- 
sulted with the representatives of all the large national associations 
directly interested in higher education as to the best methods of list- 
ing colleges and universities in respect to their standards and effi- 
ciency, and with the cooperation of these associations began the 
organization of a committee which has since held a meeting in the 
office of the Commissioner of Education and organized itself for a 
careful study of the work for which it was formed. The committee 
consists of the following: 
Prof. Walter Ballou Jacobs, New England Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools. 
Commissioner John H. Finley, Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the 
Middle States and Maryland. 
Prof. Bert E. Young, Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern 
States. 
Prof. H. A. Hollister, North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. 
Dean R. D. Salisbury, Association of American Universities. 
Chancellor Samuel Avery, National Association of State Universities. 
Dr. N. P. Colwell, American Medical Association. 
President Charles S. Howe, Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education. 
President D. J. Cowling, Association of American Colleges.

The specialist in higher education also cooperated with a com- 
mittee of the Association of Collegiate Registrars in a criticism and 
reconstruction of methods of recording college activities and the 
statistical forms of the Bureau of Education; began the preparation 
of a.scheme for the tabulation of the college curriculum, the com- 
pletion of which will enable the Bureau of Education to determine 
with greater facility questions relating to the quality and standing 
of any given institution of higher education; and began a series of 
higher-education letters to be sent to universities, colleges, normal, 
professional, and technical schools, nine of which were prepared 
and mailed before the end of the fiscal year. 
This division examined and certified as to the accuracy of the 
reports of the land-grant colleges receiving aid under the acts of 
Congress of August 30, 1890, and March 4, 1907; made a special 
examination of the methods of accounting in use in three land- 
grant colleges for negroes, and as a result of this examination is 
suggesting for all the institutions of this class a more efficient method 
of accounting. Six land-grant colleges were visited, and the divi- 
sion examined in detail one of these colleges at the request of its 
officials and made a detailed report of the findings. 
Within the year the Division of School Administration collected 
and prepared for publication important statistics in regard to school 
administration in 1,300 towns and cities having a population between 
2,500 and 30,000. It also collected and compiled information in 
regard to school savings banks, information on departmental teach- 
ing, and information in regard to the duties and work of superin- 
tendents in small cities. It prepared for publication as bulletins 
of the bureau manuscripts on Compulsory Attendance; Special 
Features in City Schools; Legislation and Judicial Decisions of the 
Years 1910-1912; Legislation and Judicial Decisions of 1913; and 
Administration of State Systems of Education. The division also 
began a complete digest of all the school laws of all the States, 
Territories, and dependencies of the United States, which has been 
continued and. completed within the current fiscal year. There is 
much need for such a digest, and this will shortly be published as a 
bulletin of the bureau. 
This division issued 16 circular letters on various phases of city 
school work and 6 circular letters of information on important 
school legislation considered and enacted during the year. The 
chief of this division visited and studied the schools of 22 cities in 
10 different States, and assisted in making a survey of the schools 
of the city of Ogden, Utah. 
During the month of August, 1913, the special agent in school 
hygiene and sanitation assembled and installed Part I of the scien- 
tific exhibit of the Fourth International Congress on School Hygiene 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XViL 
held at Buffalo, N. Y. This part of the exhibit received much atten- 
tion from people from all parts of the world, and the permanent 
international committee of the congress voted to recommend that 
similar exhibits be made at future congresses. The Division of 
School Hygiene and Sanitation completed studies of methods and 
means of health teaching in the United States, and of buildings and 
grounds for rural schools, and began studies of open-air schools and 
' school baths, both of which have since been completed. It also 
made a supplementary study of American school architecture, and 
prepared a bibliography of school hygiene, including summaries of 
scientific work gathered for the Fourth National Congress on School 
Hygiene. Cardboard models of rural schoolhouses were sent on 
request to many school boards and exhibited at a number of educa- 
tional associations. It is believed that the value of these models 
in calling attention to the urgent need of better school buildings 
has been great. 
In the division of rural education one specialist devoted most of 
his time to the study of rural education in the Southern States and 
in conference with State, county, and local authorities in these 
States. He attended conferences in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, 
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee, 
Virginia, Maryland, and other States, and aided in organizing the 
national conference of State supervisors and inspectors of rural 
schools held at Louisville, Ky., under the direction of this bureau. 
Another specialist spent most of the year in the States of the far 
West. In Utah he studied the relative merits of county supervision 
and district supervision in two adjacent counties and the organiza- 
tion of schools in agricultural villages and small towns. In this and 
other Western States he studied the rural high schools and the means 
adopted for bringing school and home into closer cooperation. In 
the course of these studies he visited approximately 300 rural schools 
and attended approximately 100 meetings of parent-teacher associa- 
tions and school-improvement leagues and attended 48 meetings of 
State and county associations and institutes. 
Still another specialist spent the year in the Middle West, visited 
schools, and attended meetings of teachers and school officers in Colo- 
rado, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. He prepared reports of 
his investigations of the schools of Minnesota, Colorado, and Ilinois, 
and prepared for publication four bulletins on the rural schools of 
Denmark, giving the results of an investigation of these schools made 
by himself and two special collaborators of the bureau in the spring 
of 1913. 
The fourth specialist made a study of consolidated schools and pub- 
lic transportation of pupils, and prepared the results of this study for
-P-A-G-E-18
  XVIII EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
publication as a bulletin of the bureau, directed the preparation of 
reports on education in the Appalachian Mountain region of the South 
and on special work of county superintendents. In March, April, and 
May he visited the British Isles and made a study of rural education 
in England, Scotland, and Ireland, with special reference to the work 
of continuation schools in rural communities, agricultural education, 
and education for home making in regular and village schools. 
All of these specialists attended State, county, and local meetings of 
school officers, teachers, and citizens held in different parts of the 
country for the discussion and consideration of the organization, man- 
agement, and support of rural schools, and gave much valuable 
assistance. 
The division. prepared and has in circulation nine duplicate sets of 
lantern slides on consolidated and rural schools and transportation 
at public expense. Each set is accompanied by a typewritten outline 
lecture and by printed material for further information. These slides 
have been sent to county superintendents and others interested in 
rural schools, and have been in constant use. Many more such sets 
are needed to supply requests for them. 
The division issued periodically a rural-school letter, which was 
sent to all State, county, and township superintendents, rural-school 
inspectors, and others who have to do with the administration. of rural 
schools. These letters are made up of brief reports of interesting 
experiments and developments in the work of rural schools. 
The Kindergarten Division of this bureau, established in the spring 
of 1913, in cooperation with the National Kindergarten Association, 
has already developed into an important agency for the promotion of 
the education of young children. There are in the United States 
approximately 4,000,000 children between 4 and 6, which is ordinarily 
considered the kindergarten age. While some formal education in 
the kindergarten or elsewhere would be helpful for all or most of these, 
the home conditions of at least half of them are such as to make the 
demand for such education for them imperative. Only about 300,000 
of these children are enrolled in the public and private kindergartens, 
and probably not more than 2,000 or 3,000 in Montessori schools and 
other schools for the education of children under the public-school 
age. There is little hope of reaching these children except by making 
the kindergarten a part of the public-school system in every city, 
town, and village. By doing this, not only would two years be added 
to the period of education of millions of children whose educational 
life must at best be all too short, but a beginning in the formation of 
moral and social habits could be made, not possible later, and much 
could be added to the individual development of the children in these 
very important years of their lives. The kindergarten has a special 
and unique value for the hundreds of thousands of foreign-born chil-
-P-A-G-E-19
  COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XIX 
dren and children of recent immigrants to this country and for negro 
children. 
During the year this division made a survey of public and private 
kindergartens and kindergartens in manufacturing villages and in 
benevolent institutions in the United States. The results of this 
survey have been published as a bulletin of the bureau. With the 
assistance of a committee of 20 experts, members of the Inter- 
national Kindergarten Union, the division made a study of all the 
kindergarten training schools of the country, about 200 in number, 
and has since prepared the results of this study for publication. The 
division also made studies and digests of the work of the kindergarten 
and primary grades of the public schools. In this study it made 
inquiries as to the double sessions in 92 cities. Primary teachers in 
114 and kindergarten teachers in 40 cities were asked for information 
and opinions as to changes needed in the kindergarten work and in 
the primary grades. The results of this study have been summarized 
for publication in a bulletin of the bureau. The division also col- 
lected from training teachers, supervisors, and directors of kinder- 
gartens and others photographs and plans of kindergarten buildings 
and equipment for kindergarten classes, which material, before 
the close of the fiscal year, was used in the preparation of a bulletin 
on kindergarten buildings, rooms, and equipment. A digest was 
made of the laws pertaining to public-school kindergartens and 
the qualifications of kindergarten teachers in the 48 States. 
Numerous inquiries have been answered with regard to State 
laws relating to kindergartens, methods of creating public senti- 
ment for the extension of kindergarten work, plans of buildings 
and equipment for kindergartens, location of training schools for 
kindergarten teachers, the value of the kindergarten as a part of the 
public-school system, the relative value of the single and double daily 
sessions for kindergartens, the difference between the kindergarten 
and the Montessori schools for small children, etc. A kindergarten 
exhibit was made at several expositions and State fairs and at the 
meetings of educational associations. Two lantern-slide lectures on 
kindergartens were circulated; speakers were sent to conventions, 
and on request assisted in campaigns for the establishment of kinder- 
gartens; several demonstration kindergartens were established. 
The specialist and assistants in negro education visited and in- 
spected negro schools in the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, 
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, and 
made comprehensive studies of each school visited. The more 
important schools of Kentucky, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Mis- 
souri were also visited and inspected. The aggregate value of the 
property of the 400 schools visited was found to be $12,500,000, 
their annual income a little less than $3,000,000. They have approxi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  xX EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
mately 75,000 pupils, of whom 15,000 are reported as pursuing sec- 
ondary subjects. As a result of these studies this bureau now has 
descriptive statements of each of these schools, showing location and 
type of school, attendance, training and sex of teachers, character 
and organization of work, financial condition and management, con- 
dition and upkeep of the plant, and relation of the school community 
to whites and negroes. On this basis have been prepared recommen- 
dations of changes and improvements which the studies indicate to 
be necessary. For each of the States two tables have been made 
showing the private and public school facilities for colored children 
in each county. Incidental to the main work of this survey some 
constructive work was done in the schools visited. This included 
improvements in the accounting systems of the schools, in cleanli- 
ness and sanitation of dormitories, and in increase of interest in those 
elements of education that are especially needed in the rural sections. 
American children are in school less than 4 per cent of their time 
from birth to 21 years of age. The home, the primitive and primary 
institution for the education of children, is still the most important 
agency for education for life—physical, mental, moral, industrial, 
economic, social, civic. The school is still only supplementary. 
Any agency, therefore, that would promote right education most 
effectually must find some means of cooperating with the home and 
of helping parents, who are the most constant, and should be the 
most effective, teachers of their children. 
It was for this purpose that the Home Education Division of the 
Bureau of Education was formed in May, 1913, in cooperation with 
the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations. 
Its aim is to investigate means and methods of improving education 
in the home, to assist parents in directing the play of their young 
children, promoting their early mental development, fostering the 
formation of right moral habits and establishing their physical 
health, the latter probably the most important element in education 
for life and efficient living. It also aims to bring about a more 
intelligent cooperation between the home and the school, so that 
both may work together intelligently for the welfare of the children 
and to extend the education of boys and girls who have quit school, 
by stimulating and directing their home reading and study. 
Through the cooperation of county school superintendents this 
division obtained within the year the names of 23,930 intelligent and 
influential women in 949 counties, each living near a country or 
village school, and invited their cooperation in carrying out its aims. 
This list has been much enlarged within the current year. It is 
hoped that the division may be able to obtain the cooperation of at 
least one such woman in the neighborhood of every rural school in the 
United States. Since the organization of this division many parent-
-P-A-G-E-21
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXI 
teacher associations have been organized, circulars of information 
have been distributed, and brief courses of reading for parents, children, 
and older boys and girls recommended. Six extensive courses of 
reading for children of different ages have been prepared and distri- 
buted. Plans are in preparation by which boards of education and 
State school officers will cooperate in the promotion of this work. 
In the preparation of these reading courses the bureau has had the 
assistance of a cooperating committee of special collaborators, con- 
sisting of C. Alphonso Smith, Edgar Allen Poe professor of English 
in the University of Virginia; Charles Forster Smith, professor of 
Greek in the University of Wisconsin; Richard Burton, professor of 
English in the University of Minnesota; and William L. Phelps, pro- 
fessor of English literature in Yale University; and of several 
collaborators especially interested in literature for children. The 
division has also prepared, for distribution, lists of lantern slides of 
educational value, suitable for use in parent-teacher associations and 
other similar societies. 
Education begins at birth, and the first years of life are the most 
important. Loss of life or health, arrest of development, the forma- 
tion of vicious habits, or the acquirement of false ideas and ideals in 
these years may render impossible or ineffective all efforts at educa- 
tion in later years. Realizing the supreme importance of the proper 
care of children in these earliest years, the division of home education 
obtained within the year the names of more than 10,000 mothers of 
children under 3 years old and prospective mothers who needed 
advice in regard to the care of their children and corresponded with 
them or sent them helpful printed matter. To 6,626 of these were 
sent copies of a bulletin of the United States Public-Health Service, 
“On the Care of Babies,” donated to the bureau for this purpose. 
This work has been much enlarged within the current fiscal year. 
In this work the bureau has also had valuable assistance from the 
executive committee of the American Medical Association. 
The Home Education Division has two offices, one in the city of 
Washington and one in Philadelphia. The office in Washington is 
under the immediate direction of the secretary of the division. The 
Philadelphia office is under the direction of a special collaborator of 
the bureau, who is also general director of the division. 
The Division of Civic Education was established in March, 1914, 
in cooperation with the National Municipal League. The purpose of 
this division is to investigate methods of teaching, in the schools and 
elsewhere, those things that pertain directly to the duties and respon- 
sibilities of citizenship in a democracy, and of membership in larger 
and smaller communities, and to foster the desire and will to so live 
and act as to promote the public welfare.
-P-A-G-E-22
  XXII EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Whatever calling or profession one or another may follow, all are 
citizens. Citizenship is inevitable, without regard to age, position in 
life, vocation, race, social position, or the possession of the right of 
suffrage. Every citizen is constantly influenced for good or bad by 
many agencies, and must become helpful and useful to the com- 
munity or else a burden to society or a menace to the State, and 
perhaps both. The school, and every other conscious agency of 
education, whether for children and youths or for adults, should 
work for civic righteousness and efficiency. 
It is generally conceded that the methods now in common use 
for teaching the duties of citizenship are inadequate, and there is 
a strong widespread demand for help in developing better methods. 
On the other hand, successful experiments have been made here 
and there which seem to show the way to better methods and results. 
To find and bring together the best thought and experience on 
this subject, and make them available to all teachers, school officers, 
and others interested in civic education, and to bring into cooper- 
ation with the Bureau of Education all the agencies that have 
hitherto been working toward the common end of the better teaching 
of this subject, but independently of each other, has been the first 
work of this division. These agencies include not only schools 
and colleges, but numerous civic leagues and other organizations 
which both supplement the work of the schools for children and 
youths and also provide for adults instruction in civics and the 
duties of citizenship. 
Within the brief period between the establishment of this division 
and the close of the fiscal year the specialist in civic education 
gathered, organized, and developed much information about civic 
education in elementary schools; cooperated with several associations 
studying civic education in secondary schools; began a study of 
the preparation of teachers, both in training and in service, for 
effective work in this and allied subjects; and cooperated with the 
American Political Science Association in an inquiry in regard to 
instruction in government in colleges and universities. Through the 
cooperation of the Intercollegiate Civic League, he visited seven 
colleges and universities and observed the work of civic and good- 
government clubs of college men in these institutions and wrote a 
preliminary report of his observations. He also visited, on invita- 
tion, the cities of St. Louis, Kansas City, Louisville, Boston, and 
Yonkers to confer with school officers and civic committees relative 
to the reorganization of civic instruction both through the school 
and through other agencies. Plans were begun and have since been 
continued for the development of more adequate methods of civic 
instruction for adult immigrants and for the stimulation and promo- 
tion of public discussion and debate of questions of general and
-P-A-G-E-23
  
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXT 
local public interest in colleges, schools, clubs, and social centers. 
A series of brief circulars, known as ‘‘The civic-education series,” 
was begun and has been continued. These circulars are mailed to 
school officers and teachers in elementary and secondary schools. 
Through the cooperation of the North American Civic League 
a division for the investigation of the education of immigrants was 
established in April, 1914, under the immediate direction of a trained 
sociologist and investigator, who was at once assigned to work in 
connection with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor, at Harris- 
burg, to make investigations of illiteracy among adult immigrants 
and of methods of preparing immigrants for citizenship and for 
participation in American industrial, social, and civic life. The work 
undertaken then has. since been finished and reported, and other 
important work begun. 
Within the year the Editorial Division of the bureau issued the 
Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education in two volumes, 
Volume I being a comprehensive survey of the progress of education 
within the year in the United States and a briefer survey of progress 
in other countries; Volume II being a survey of statistics of education 
in the United States. Fifty-three bulletins were issued, containing 
a total of 4,122 pages. Among these were studies of industrial 
education, prison schools, special features in city school systems, 
rural education surveys, pension systems for teachers, economy of 
time in education, school playgrounds, the reorganization of second- 
ary education, school hygiene and health in schools, education of 
immigrants, legislation and judicial decisions relating to education, 
school systems of Switzerland, England, and Denmark, compulsory 
school attendance, vocational guidance, kindergartens, salaries of 
teachers, and university extension. More than a half million copies 
of these bulletins were distributed. 
The issue of brief multigraphed circulars on educational subjects, 
begun a year or two ago, developed considerably during the year. 
Approximately 600,000 copies of various multigraphed articles were 
mailed. Special statements on educational matters were issued to 
the newspapers during the year at the rate of three a week. While 
it is impracticable to check up systematically the publication of 
this material, the clipping returns indicate that the percentage of 
use is high. This service is useful in popularizing knowledge of 
education and is constantly increasing. At the end of the year 
the number of persons reached by each issue of the various circulars 
was as follows: Press letter, 2,200; city-school circular, 5,000; legis- 
lative circular, 2,700; rural-school letter, 5,200; higher-education 
letter, 1,500. In the case of some of the circulars it was found 
necessary to order much larger editions than here indicated, to 
answer the demand for additional copies, and the bureau was com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  XXIV EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
pelled to refuse many urgent requests from superintendents to 
have their teachers put on the list to receive this material. Many 
superintendents report that they are filing or binding these letters; 
others reprint them for distribution to teachers; still others save 
their copies and print them together in a bulletin for their com- 
munities at the close of the year. 
The bureau’s experience with these duplicated articles, usually only 
two pages in length, emphasizes the need for a type of pamphlet ma- 
terial supplied now only in part—leaflets of three or four printed 
pages on current educational topics. The present supply of bulletins, - 
often wholly inadequate for even the most important demands, 
might be made to go much farther if we could print leaflets in large 
quantities to answer the general inquiries that come in constantly 
increasing volume. It is hoped that the printing laws may soon be 
so amended as to permit the printing of such leaflets in large numbers. 
Some idea of the extent of the statistical work of the bureau may 
be gained from the statement that the bureau collected and tabu- 
lated in the fiscal year statistics of— 
48 State school systems. 
1,158 city school systems. 
596 universities and colleges. e 
69 agricultural and mechanical colleges, 
556 professional schools. 
1,094 training schools for nurses. 
284 normal schools. 
673 summer schools. 
11,277 public high schools. 
2,168 private high schools and academies. 
1,167 public high schools having courses in agriculture, domestic economy, etc. 
51 public manual-training schools. 
103 schools of agriculture. 
200 technical and industrial-training schools. 
618 commercial schools. 
426 schools for negroes. 
106 State industrial schools and reformatories. 
64 institutions for the blind. 
147 institutions for the deaf. 
59 institutions for the feeble-minded. 
13,595 public, county, and school libraries. Z 
Attention is here called to the fact that the educational directory, 
which formerly was included in this volume of the Annual Report of 
the Commissioner of Education, is now issued as a separate publica- 
tion. This directory for the current year contains the names of — 
Officers of the United States Bureau of Education. 
Principal State school officers. 
Officers of State boards of education. 
Executive officers of State library commissions. 
Superintendents of cities and towns of 4,000 population and over.

The accessions to the library during the year were: Bound volumes, 
4,893; serial publications, 8,482 numbers; periodicals, 8,745 num- 
bers. This is now one of the most important libraries on education 
in the world and should be so housed as to make it of the largest pos- 
sible use to all who are interested in this subject. An important part 
of the work of the library division is the compilation of bibliographies 
upon request of teachers and school officers. The division compiled 
during the year 223 bibliographies. Lists of references on 15 sub- 
jects were separately printed in leaflet form, and 5 of these lists, the 
original edition having become exhausted, were thoroughly revised 
and reprinted. The division also prepares for publication a monthly 
record of all educational publications. 
The library continued its service to students of education in univer- 
sities, colleges, normal schools, and to teachers’ associations and in- 
dividual students by lending upon request books on various subjects 
of education. The library also had prepared a permanent traveling 
exhibit illustrating the work of school libraries. This exhibit 
was first displayed at the 1914 meeting of the American Library 
Association, and it has since been put on exhibition at the St. Paul 
meeting of the National Education Association, at various State and 
sectional teachers’ associations, and at summer schools. 
The increase in the correspondence of the bureau is indicated by the 
fact that within the fiscal year 84,332 letters, not including returns
-P-A-G-E-26
  XXVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
to blank forms of inquiry, were received at the Washington office. 
If the letters received at the Seattle office, at substations of the 
bureau, and by agents in the field be counted, the total exceeded 
100,000. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1910, the total number 
of letters received was only 18,463. 
The introduction to the report of the Commissioner of Education 
for the year ended June 30, 1913, contains a fairly complete account 
of conditions and needs of education among the natives of Alaska, 
and the purposes and aims of this bureau in regard to them. In its 
proper place in the present volume is contained a full account of the 
work for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1914; it is not, therefore, 
necessary to make further reference to it in this introduction. 
The efforts of the commissioner to bring the Bureau of Education 
into closer touch with the many interests and agencies of education, in 
all parts of the country and to obtain a fuller cooperation of school 
officers and teachers were continued through the year with gratifying 
success. The National Education Association, the International 
Kindergarten Union, and severel other important associations ap- 
pointed committees to cooperate with the bureau in its work. One 
of the most important cooperating committees is the committee on 
standards, appointed by the Department of Superintendence of the 
National Education Association and consisting of 16 members of the 
association, who are undertaking to investigate, in cooperation 
with the Bureau of Education, standards of teaching and attainment 
in all the more important subjects taught in our public schools. The 
National Committee on Standards is cooperating with the bureau in 
defining new and uncertain terms used in writings on education. 
This policy of cooperation has been further extended within the 
current fiscal year and will be still further extended as opportunity 
offers. It hes been found very helpful in many important ways. 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
In the Statement of the Commissioner of Education to the Secre- 
tary of the Interior for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1914, I sub- 
mitted the following recommendations for the extension and im- 
provement of the work of the bureau: 
(1) An increase in the salaries of chief clerk, editor, statistician, specialist in land- 
grant colleges statistics, specialist in higher education and other specialties, and the 
removal of the limit on amount of salaries which may be paid from the lump-sum 
appropriation for rural school education and industrial education. The duties of these 
positions require the services of men and women of such kind and degree of ability as 
demand salaries considerably higher than are now paid in this bureau. I can only 
repeat what I said in my statement for 1913, that work of this kind had better not be 
attempted than not done well. 
(2) An assistant commissioner, who should also be a specialist in secondary education 
and should serve as chief of a high-school division of the bureau. The duties of the
-P-A-G-E-27
  
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION, Xxvit 
office make it necessary for the commissioner to visit distant parts of the country and 
to be absent from the office frequently many days at a time. There should be an 
assistant commissioner to carry on the work in the office. The increased work in the 
office demands much more of the commissioner than was demanded formerly. Prob- 
ably the most important phase in public education in the United States at present is 
that of the secondary schools. The high school is, or should be, the heart and center 
of our school system. The problems of the high school are more difficult and their 
solution more urgent than those of any other part of the school system. The head of 
the high-school division of the bureau should therefore be a man of great ability. 
By combining the offices of assistant commissioner and of specialist in secondary 
education it should be possible to pay a salary sufficiently large to attract a man of 
such ability. 
(3) Additional specialists in higher education, including education in universities, 
colleges, schools of technology, schools of professional education, and normal schools. 
There is special need of an able man, familiar with agricultural education and the prob- 
lems of negro education in the South, to devote his entire time and attention to the 
colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts for negroes in the Southern States. 
(4) An increase in the number of specialists and assistants in rural education and 
industrial education. The appropriation for salaries and expenses in these subjects 
for the current year is $30,000. With this it is impossible to obtain the services of 
more than eight specialists and assistants and have a sufficient amount left to pay the 
necessary traveling expenses. There is urgent need for not less than three times this 
number of men and women for this work. 
(5) More adequate provision for the investigation and promotion of school sanitation 
and hygiene. Nearly 20,000,000 children spend a good part of their time each year in 
public and private schools in the United States. They come to these schools that 
they may gain preparation and strength for life. In many of the schools the heating, 
lighting, ventilation, and other means of sanitation are so poor that instead of gaining 
strength for life they have the seeds of disease and death sown in their systems. In 
many other schools the daily regimen is such as to cause the children to lose a very large 
per cent of that which they might gain with a better regimen. From State, county, 
and city school officers, in all parts of the country, thousands of requests come to the 
‘ bureau for information and advice in regard to these matters. The bureau should be 
able to give accurate information and sound advice regarding all the various phases of 
this subject. The establishment of health and right health habits must be considered 
a most important and vital principle in any education that is to fit for life. 
(6) The formation of a division, with a group of able specialists and assistants, for 
the investigation of problems of education and school administration in cities and 
towns. The drift of population to the cities and towns continues, and the proportion 
of urban population to rural population is increasing rapidly. Almost one-half of the 
children in the United States now live in cities, towns, and densely populated subur- 
ban communities. In some section of the country a very large proportion of these 
children are the children of foreign-born parents. All this adds to the complexity and 
difficulty of the problems of city school administration, especially in the larger cities. 
Many hundreds of requests for advice and information in regerd to these problems 
come to the bureau every year. At present there is no one in the bureau whose special 
duty it is to respond to them. 
(7) The establishment of a division, with specivlists and assistants, for the investiga- 
tion of exceptional children. There are in the United States more than 9 million 
children whose education requires means varying widely from those in common use 
for the education of normal children. These children are to be found in cities, towns, 
and rural communities alike, and all school officers and teachers have to deal with 
them. The Bureau of Education can not be considered as performing its duties to all 
the population with impartiality until it has in its service men and women who can
-P-A-G-E-28
  XXVOI EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
give accurate information and helpful advice in regard to the education of these 
children. 
(8) Provision for the investigation of the education of adult illiterates and the 
dissemination of information as to the best methods of teaching literate men and 
women to read and write, and of extending the meager education of those who were 
denied the advantages of the schools in their childhood and youth. According to the 
census of 1910 there were in the United States more than 5,500,000 illiterate men and 
women and children over the age when they may be expected to make a beginning in 
the public schools, and there were many millions more barely able to read and write. 
This illiteracy is a burden to society and to State and Nation. Within the last few 
years considerable interest in the removal of this burden has developed. Itis believed 
that States, local communities, individuals, and benevolent societies would heartily 
cooperate in any rational plans which might be devised and presented by this bureau 
for this purpose. 
(9) A careful and thorough investigation as to the means of better education of 
children in the homes, and the dissemination, of information as to the best methods for 
the early physical, mental, and moral education of children in the home, and for the 
better cooperation of home end school in the education of children of school age. 
Children of the United States are in school less than 4 per cent of their time from birth 
to 21. The home is the primary and fundamental educational institution. Schools 
and other agencies are only secondary. If education in the home fails, no other agency 
can make good the failure. With our changing civilization and social and industrial 
life, there is need of more careful study of education in the home. The bureau has 
already made a beginning in this work, but there is need of far more than it can hope 
to do without much larger equipment for it. 
(10) A specialist in educational theory and practice, to serve as a director of investi- 
gations in education, assisting National, State, and local committees and commissions 
and making available for them the large collections of material in the library of the 
bureau and elsewhere in Washington. National, State, and local associations appoint 
many committees and States and cities appoint many commissions to investigate and 
report on various problems of education. Many of these committees and commissions 
fail more or less completely for want of material and intelligent assistance and direc- 
tion. The library of this bureau, one of the most complete of its kind in the world, 
contains a large collection of material for most of these investigations. The specialist 
here recommended could put this collection at the service of these committees and 
commissions and at the same time give much-needed assistance and direction. His 
services would also be valuable to other specialists in the bureau and to hundreds of 
individual students of education upon whose investigations the country depends for 
most of its knowledge of education. 
(11) A librarian, A library of more than 150,000 volumes, reports, and pamphlets, 
and an annual accession of more than 20,000 pieces is now under the direction of a 
clerk acting as librarian. The use of the library as a source library by students and 
schools in all parts of the country is increasing, and with the increase in the bureau 
and its work the use made of the library by employees of the bureau is also increasing 
rapidly. To promote the best use of the library and to avoid waste of time and money 
in the bureau itself, the library should have expert supervision. 
(12) An assistant editor. The editorial work of the office has increased fivefold 
within the last four years, and it must increase still further within the next year. Itis 
now impossible for one editor to perform satisfactorily all the required editorial work. 
(18) A specialist in foreign and domestic systems of education and an assistant in 
foreign systems of education. This bureau is undertaking to keep the people of the 
United States informed as to all important progress in education and in methods of 
teaching in all countries of the world. It must have, in order to accomplish this work 
with any degree of satisfaction, the additional assistance here indicated.
-P-A-G-E-29
  COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXIX 
(14) Two additional collectors and compilers of statistics. Material for prompt and 
reliable statistical reports can not be had by this bureau without frequent visits to 
State and city education offices and the first-hand study of their returns. 
(15) Additional clerks, copyists, laborers, and messengers to correspond with the 
increase made possible by additional specialists. 
(16) An increase of appropriation for traveling expenses for the commissioner and 
employees acting under his direction. This is necessary to enable them to make or 
nal investigations in education in different parts of the country and to disseminate 
information by meeting with educational associations and other societies interested 
in education in different parts of the country, which is the most effective means for 
the dissemination of such information. 
(17) Means to enable the bureau to cooperate with schools of education in col- 
leges and universities, with normal schools, and with city-school systems in making 
important investigations and definite experiments in elementary and secondary school 
education under scientific control. With a comparatively small amount of money 
the bureau might obtain the cooperation of individuals, institutions, and boards of 
education in making important investigations and experiments in education not other- 
wise possible without much larger expenditures. 
(18) An appropriation of $125,000 to enable the Secretary of the Interior, in his dis- 
cretion and under his direction, and with the advice and cooperation of the Public 
Health Service, to provide for the medical and sanitary relief of the Eskimos, Aleuts, 
Indians, and other natives of Alaska. Careful investigations made with the coopera- 
tion of the Public Health Service have shown the necessity of immediate provisions for 
the care of the health of the natives of this Territory and for the eradication of com- 
municable diseases now prevalent in different sections of the Territory which, if not 
rut under immediate control, will soon destroy the lives of many of these people and 
spread among the white settlers. From year to year the bureau has used an increas- 
ingly large proportion of the appropriation for the education of the natives of Alaska 
for medical attendance and for general sanitation. To do this it has had to close 
schools in several villages and to withdraw from these villages all the influences for the 
civilization and improvement of the people. This should not be continued longer, 
and unless special funds are appropriated for medical attendance or the appropriation 
for education largely increased, the bureau must abandon all attempts to care for the 
health of these people. 
(19) An increase of $1,000 in the appropriation for the distribution of reindeer in 
Alaska. The Alaskan reindeer service, which was begun in a small way a little more 
than 20 years ago, has now reached large proportions and hasaccomplished much for the 
support and for the education and civilization of the natives in the northwestern part 
of the Territory. The bureau should extend at once the distribution of reindeer in 
the section in which reindeer may be herded profitably, to give all the natives of 
this section the advantage which has already come to those living in settlements to 
which reindeer have been sent, and to complete this work so there may not be need fora 
continuation of the appropriation for this purpose. 
All these recommendations are for the immediate needs of the bureau. They will 
require an appropriation of not less than $275,000. 
To enable the bureau to perform satisfactorily the function for which it was created 
and to respond to the demands for a clearing house for accurate information, well- 
matured opinion, and sound advice in regard to all phases of education and for assist- 
ance in promoting democratic education throughout the country, there will be need. 
in the near future for an annual income of a half million dollars and for an education 
building with ample room for the library of the bureau and a complete educational 
museum in which school officers, teachers, and students of education may find, prop- 
erly arranged and catalogued, typical specimens of all forms of school furniture and 
equipment, with outlines of courses of study and whatever else will enable them to 
     
-P-A-G-E-30
  XXX EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
gain a comprehensive view of purposes, methods, and results of education in this and 
other countries and assist them in forming ideals for the improvement of their own 
schools and work. This will enable the bureau to respond to its part of the demands 
the States and the people have a right to make of the Federal Government, which 
was created to serve States and people in those things in which they can not serve 
themselves at all, or so well, or only at such cost as would become unnecessarily bur- 
densome, 
EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 
For several years past surveys have been made in this country of 
city and State school systems. Two chapters of this report are 
devoted to reviews of these surveys, and this bureau now has in press 
a bulletin containing a brief account of school surveys in other coun- 
tries. Within the last year or two the survey has been extended to 
colleges. The most noted examples of college surveys thus far are 
the survey of the University of Wisconsin, by the State board of 
public affairs, and the survey of the University of Vermont and the 
colleges of that State contained in the general survey of the State by 
the Carnegie Foundation. There are indications that for one reason 
or another many colleges will be subjected to this inventorying process 
within the next few years. Already this bureau has promised to 
make more or less complete surveys of a half dozen colleges and half 
as many normal schools within the next fiscal year. 
Because of the newness and importance of the college survey, I 
take the liberty of appending here a paper on this subject which I 
prepared for and read at the nineteenth annual meeting of the 
National Association of State Universities in the United States of 
America, in Washington City, last November. While this does not 
pretend to give an exhaustive analysis of the subject, it contains 
nevertheless, I believe, a fairly clear statement of some of the prin- 
ciples which must be kept in mind if these surveys are to be made 
helpful. The special references to State universities and to colleges 
of agriculture and mechanic arts are justified both by the fact that 
the paper was prepared for a meeting of representatives of State uni- 
versities and by the certainty that the majority of college surveys 
for many years to come will be of institutions partly or wholly sup- 
ported by State and Federal funds and under State control. 
CottrcEe SuRVEYS. 
The college survey is a new thing among us, and we know little about it as yet; I 
am sure I know very little. It is, however, a legitimate thing and altogether worthy 
of our very careful consideration. If one counts direct expenditures, interest on 
investments, value of time of students, and cost of their living at college the colleges 
of this country represent an annual expenditure of about $400,000,000. So large an 
expenditure for a purpose so important should have a most careful and intelligent 
supervision, to the end that the best results may be obtained. The magnitude, both 
of expenditures and of work, has increased very rapidly within the last ten or fifteen 
years. The 625 colleges reporting to the Bureau of Education in 1900 reported a total
-P-A-G-E-31
  
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXXI 
income of a little less than $25,000,000. The 596 colleges reporting in 1913 reported a 
total of something more than $105,000,000. The total income of the 567 institutions 
reporting in 1914 was $120,579,257, of which $18,422,856 was for endowment. Quan- 
tity and variety of work done have probably increased in about the same proportion. 
Any survey of the equipment, standards, administration, and work of a college 
should be sympathetic and constructive, as should any school survey, and not unsym- 
pathetic and destructive. Those making the survey should be men and women who 
know what college life and work are and who have just ideas as to what it may be 
made. They should understand the relation of the college to society and state, to 
other parts of the system of public education, and to industrial life. They should 
know what education means and have a just conception of relative values in educa- 
tion. The college survey committee should be composed of expert accountants, 
good business men with a right understanding of business efficiency and an apprecia- 
tion of its value—professional men and educators. If faculty and trustees are not 
directly represented on the committee, then full hearings should be given to repre- 
sentatives of both these bodies. Every such commitiee should contain two or three 
persons having the same grade of ability and composed of the same character of experi- 
ence as the best of our college professors, deans, and presidents, but having at the 
same time a larger general knowledge of colleges in all parts of this country and in 
other countries than most college men can be expected to have. These men should 
also be able to bring to their work knowledge and skill gained in other surveys of this 
kind; they could thus give valuable aid to the committee as a whole in beginning the 
survey, in determining standards, and in judging of the work of the college in the light 
of a knowledge of the best of other institutions. The United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion should be able to contribute and help to secure such experts for every survey 
committee. 
(1) The committee thus organized should make a careful and intelligent survey of 
the State, the section of country, or the portion of society served by the college; its 
industrial, social, and civic condition and tendencies; its present educational needs 
and its probable needs in the near future. It should make a careful investigation of 
other educational institutions and agencies serving the same State, section, or portion 
of society. Remembering that colleges and other institutions and agencies of educa- 
tion do not exist for their own glory, but for the service they can render, the com- 
mittee should try to determine wisely what service should be performed by the college 
under survey and what should be left for other institutions and agencies to render. 
Almost everywhere in America there is much loss through overlapping and duplica- 
tion of work. In one of the Southern States there are 5 colleges and universities for 
Negroes, all offering the same courses and attempting to maintain the same kind of 
equipment and do the same kind of work. The 5 have a total of less than 150 college 
students. One well-equipped college could do the work done by all and do it much 
better. One college would be almost as convenient to the students attending them 
as the 5. Most college students in that State, as elsewhere, must live away from 
home. When away from home it makes little difference whether the distance is 25 
miles or 250 miles. One of the States of the Middle West has 24 colleges striving to do 
the same kind of work. A single religious denomination has, I believe, 6 colleges in 
the State, all claiming to be of the same rank. It is encouraging to know that church 
boards of education are beginning to see the unwisdom of such duplication of insti- 
tutions and are undertaking to differentiate their schools and to organize them into 
systems, every part of which may cooperate wisely with every other part. 
(2) A survey of a State university should make a careful study of its relation to 
other colleges in the State. If the State agricultural college is located elsewhere as 
a separate institution, the survey should attempt to determine the proper sphere and 
function of each. Should, for example, advanced courses in engineering be given 
in each institution? 
73226°—xzp 1514—von 1——11   
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  XXXIL EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
A study of the community served by the college and of other institutions and agen- 
cies of education serving the same community will enable the committee to better 
determine the proper and legitimate work of the college and assist it to some extent 
at least in determining standards to be used in judging of its administration, equip- 
ment, and work. 
(3) Thesurvey should include a careful examination of the charter of the institution, 
to determine whether or not its terms are such as to permit it to do honestly and effec- 
tively the work which it should now undertake and what changes, if any, are necessary 
to permit it to do this work better. The charters of many of the older colleges were 
issued when the conditions of the country and its educational needs were quite 
different from what they are at present. An institution can hardly claim to be doing 
its work honestly if its name does not indicate clearly the type of work which it does. 
(4) The control of the college should be considered carefully. Are the organiza- 
tion of the board of trustees, the methods of election of its members and their terms 
of service such as to foster sound and steady development and progress, avoiding 
ultraconservatism and stagnation on the one hand and violent and cataclysmal revo- 
lutions on the other? State institutions are especially subject to injurious partisan 
political interferences and to violent and hurtful revolutions. All institutions sup- 
ported by the people must of course be controlled by the people. The State uni- 
versity should not, I believe, be controlled by a self-perpetuating board or close 
corporation. If the people are asked to appropriate their. money for the support of 
the schools, then they must be intrusted with their control. I believe in the principle 
of the fullest possible trust in the general wisdom of all the people. Yet, the public 
as a whole can not always be on its guard, and it is subject to delusions and hysteria. 
It must through the form of organization of its institutions protect itself against danger 
from its agents in its moments of preoccupation and from itself in its moments of 
insanity. Is the personnel of the board of trustees such as to insure intelligent rep- 
resentation of the best interests of the clientele of the college? 
(5) The administration of the college must be an item of great importance to the 
survey. Is the internal organization of the college such as to give to each depart- 
ment, school, professor, and assistant the best possible opportunity for the most 
effective work? Is there freedom from the annoyance that comes through having 
to give an undue amount of time to petty details of the administration and the so-called 
college and student interests? Are freedom and independence on the one hand and 
college spirit and intelligent sympathetic cooperation among administrative officers, 
members of the faculty, and students on the other hand fostered and promoted? 
Are the duties of the various offices clearly defined, and are they performed in an 
efficient and business-like manner? The business of a college should be conducted 
on business principles. Are the overhead charges for administration proportionately 
larger than they should be? In school and college there is now, I believe, danger 
that too much of the income may go for administration and equipment and too little 
to those who do the actual work of instruction. All efficient business organizations 
try to determine accurately their expenditures for administration and to make them 
as low as they may be without injury to the efficiency of administration. We need 
some careful studies to find just what are the proper ratios of cost of administration 
to cost of instruction in colleges and schools of several different types. Until these 
studies have been made we can have no standards by which to measure the efficiency 
of administration in this respect. 
The survey should inquire carefully as to whether funds received by the college 
for specific purposes are used for the purposes specified. This applies especially 
to the land-grant colleges and the funds which they receive from the Federal Govern- 
ment. In the beginning it was difficult for many of these colleges to use the Federal 
funds according to the spirit of the law and it is still difficult for some of them, but 
the time has now come when their incomes from other sources should be made sufli-
-P-A-G-E-33
  
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXXII 
cient to enable them all to use the Federal funds not only according to the letter of the 
law, very liberally interpreted, as it has been by the Department of the Interior, but 
also according to the full intent and purpose of the several acts of Congress through 
which the funds are received. 
(6) Probably most important of all for the survey committee will be the faculty 
of the college, its general makeup, and the character, education, experience, and 
teaching ability of its members. As is the teacher, so is the school. The teacher 
is the school. The teacher makes the school and like every other creator he makes it 
in his own image and likeness. We have applied these sayings over and over again 
to elementary and secondary schools. They are equally applicable to the college. 
As are the members of the faculty, so is the college orso will it become. Those who 
give instruction make the college, not its trustees, president, and other officers of 
administration, nor its buildings, grounds, and other equipment. These all help, 
but those who come in daily contact with the students as teachers are of first import- 
ance in determining the character and worth of the college. What proportion of 
the teachers are strong men and women of tried and recognized ability and what 
proportion are weak and untried? A college may have in its faculty a few professors 
of great and known ability retained at large salaries, while the great majority of its 
professors and instructors are weak, inefficient, or untried, and are living on salaries 
totally inadequate. The former may give the college a temporary reputation, but 
the latter do most of the teaching and give it its real character. A smaller faculty 
of men and women of more nearly uniform ability might do much better work and 
enable the school to render better permanent service. 
The survey should consider the distribution of instructors among the classes. More 
than 60 per cent of the young men and women who enter college quit before the 
beginning of the third college year; probably about 40 per cent leave at the end of the 
first year or before. Thus a large majority of all the students of our colleges are in 
the classes of the first two years. It is doubtful if a college is making the best use 
of its opportunities or rendering its best service when it assigns its weak and lowest 
salaried instructors and assistants to these classes and reserves the services of its few 
able and highly paid professors for the remnant of students in the last two college 
years. It is, I think, quite certain that more students would remain for the higher 
classes if they came in contact with the abler and better men and women of the fac- 
ulty during the earlier years of their college life. It is this principle which I have 
had in mind when urging the establishment of junior colleges and the transformation 
of many of the colleges we now have into institutions of this kind. 
(7) The distribution of students among the several courses and classes of the college 
must also be considered. In most colleges are to be found classes too large for effective 
work and others so small as to make the cost of instruction disproportionately large. 
This may sometimes be unavoidable, but usually a careful study of conditions will 
reveal the possibility of such changes of schedules or such redistribution of students 
and reassignment of instructors as will remedy the evil. 
(8) Are the salaries paid professors and assistants such as to attract and hold men 
and women of first-class ability? No institution can afford to lose continually its 
best men and women and to fill the vacancies thus created with men and women of 
less ability or of doubtful and untried ability. It may be complimentary to a college 
to have its best professors called to richer and better institutions, but it does not 
contribute to its efficiency. A college should strive to keep in its faculty those who 
have proven their worth. To attain its largest usefulness, it must use great care and 
wisdom in selecting new members of its faculty, offer sufficient salaries to obtain the’ 
services of those who give best promise of usefulness, and then make the conditions of 
service and the increase of pay such as to retain in its service those who make good. .

(9) Is the sum paid for teachers of all grades so used as to obtain the maximum 
teaching results, keeping in mind both the ability of the teachers and the size of 
their classes? While classes should be reasonably small, the size of the class is not 
of first importance. A competent teacher, with a class of 30 students, may accom- 
plish much more for each individual student than two less competent teachers with 
classes of only 15 students each. Maximum and optimum sizes of classes will, of 
course, vary for different subjects. You probably all know of the valuable study 
recently made of the student-hour costs of instruction in one American college and 
the comparison of these costs with the student-hour costs in other colleges, the pur- 
pose of the study being to arrive at some standard of costs. To have such a standard 
is no doubt important. Student-hour and per capita cost of instruction will depend 
on the average salary of instructors and the average ratio of number of instructors to 
number of students. Fifty thousand dollars for 25 teachers to teach 250 students in 
classes averaging 10 students each, and fifty thousand dollars paid to 15 teachers to 
teach 250 students in classes of 15 or 16 students each, will give the same per capita 
and student-hour costs, but this does not at all prove that the one policy is as wise as 
the other. In teaching, as elsewhere, and more than in most other things, one who 
can do the work well is worth more than two or five who can not. In elementary 
schools I have seen one teacher with a class of 60 children do for each child more than 
twice as much as another teacher in the same school did for a class of 30 children. 
In some subjects classes may well be large, in others they must be small. The survey 
committee should consider the skill with which these principles are applied in the 
college. 
(10) What is the attitude of members of the faculty toward their work, the work of 
other members of the faculty, the student body, and the college as a whole? This is, 
or is close akin to, that indefinable but all important something generally known as 
esprit de corps. Something is wrong with a college in whose faculty there is not such 
a spirit of a very fine and high type. A right attitude of all members of a college 
faculty in these respects will counterbalance much lack of equipment and other 
defects. 
(11) Next must be considered the student body. Where do the students come 
from? What classes of society do they represent? Are all classes represented in 
proper proportion? A State university supported by the taxes of all the people of 
all parts of the State is failing in its duty if it does not draw students in just propor- 
tion from all classes of society and all parts of the State. If there is not such a just 
representation, why not? A careful investigation will frequently reveal the fact 
that the university has failed to put itself equally in close and vital contact with all 
classes of the people and all sections of the State. A State university must remember 
its equal duty to all and direct its interests and energies accordingly. 
(12) How are students distributed among schools, departments, and classes? Stu- 
dents should, of course, be given much freedom in the choice of their courses and the 
direction of their work. Nevertheless, if the survey of the State, section of country, 
or portion of society served by the college indicates a fairly definite need and demand 
for men and women with certain different kinds of college training in somewhat 
definite numbers, the colleges on which the State, section of country, or portion of 
society in question depends for its educated men and women must see to it that these 
are prepared in about the relative numbers needed. The work of the colleges should 
not result in an overproduction of any one kind of ability and injurious underproduc- 
tion of another kind. The colleges of a State in which many engineers of various 
‘kinds are needed for the profitable development of its resources should not persist in 
a policy which sends most of its students into the law and the ministry. To bring 
about a right proportion in the number of students taking various courses may be 
difficult, but it is essential to the best service on the part of the college. Where it has 
not been done the survey should call attention to the failure, and if possible show
-P-A-G-E-35
  
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXXV 
how it may be remedied. Sometimes one or more popular professors in one depart- 
ment will draw students in undue proportion from other departments in which the 
professors are less popular. Parents advise their sons—they used to do this more 
than now—to take professors rather than courses. ‘It is the man that counts, and 
not the subject,’ they say, and in a measure this is true. The personality of a man 
does count for much in the high school and in the lower classes of the college and 
for something in the higher classes, but for these higher classes and in technical sub- 
jects the man counts for less and the subject for more than in the lower classes. 
(12) What is the spirit of the student body? Is it one of work, earnest endeavor, 
and high ideals, or the opposite? Colleges differ much in this respect. This general 
attitude of the student body differentiates itself into the attitude of thestudent body 
as a whole toward the college, toward the faculty, toward college work and ‘‘student 
activities,” and the attitude of individual students toward each other. Are “‘student 
activities” lacking or do they assume an undue relative importance? Are the stu- 
dents united for all legitimate work oi the college or are they divided into unsympa- 
thetic factions? That the student body should have a spirit of earnest work is, of 
course, of the greatest importance. It may beagood thing for boys to live about a 
college, but it is certainly much better for them also to work at college, forming 
habits of work to be taken with them into the world as well as gaining whatever 
knowledge and skill may be gained by work at college. 
(14) How long do the students of the college remain? The ability of the college to 
hold its students must be counted as an important factor in its success. Few young 
men and women of this day of economic prosperity and the low cost of living (as meas- 
ured in terms of labor) are obliged to leave college to go to work. Whether they remain 
long in college or leave early depends very largely on the appeal college life makes to 
them and the extent to which the college inspires them with a desire for that which it 
can give. 
(15) What are the standards of admission, promotion, and graduation, and how well 
are they enforced? ‘There is no longer any good reason, I believe, why any institution 
calling itself a college and giving college degrees should admit students who have had 
less than is offered in a good high school of four years. There are now approximately 
14,000 high schools in the United States. Nearly 10,000 of these offer four years’ 
work based upon the full amount of elementary school work of seven, eight, or 
nine years. Few communities are unable to maintain one or more good high schools. 
If any community feels unable to maintain such a school, it will usually be cheaper, 
and I believe almost always better for the boys and girls of that community to 
attend high school in some other community than to go unprepared to a low-grade, 
cheap college which attempts to do both high-school and college work without adequate 
equipment for either. 
In determining the standards of a college, consideration must also be given to the 
extent to which “‘conditions” are allowed and the way in which they are made up, 
and to the extent to which work credited for admission is also credited as college work 
and counted toward graduation. If the college requires on paper four years of high- 
school work, or 16 units, but admits a large per cent of its students on three years of high- 
school work, 12 or 13 units, and permits these more poorly prepared students to make 
up their conditions during the regular time for college work, it can hardly claim that its 
standards are as high or that it can offer as much to its well-prepared students as a col- 
lege allowing no admission conditions to be made up in the regular time for college 
work; nor are the standards really what they appear to be if work accepted for admis- 
sion is not used as a basis for the college work. A college may accept for admission 
two or more units in chemistry, physics, and biology, but not base its own work in 
these subjects on the beginnings already made by the students, requiring these 
students to do their high-school work over again with freshmen who have had no work 
in these subjects, or else to wait until other students have done the beginning work  
-P-A-G-E-36
  XXXVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
and then join them in a higher class. Under these conditions students offering for 
admission work in a subject and then taking the college work in the same subject do 
not get an amount of work in that subject equal to the sum of the years of work done in 
the high school plus the years offered in college, but only the work represented by the 
number of years in the subject offered by the college. Again, it may well be asked how 
much of the college work really is work for which college credits should be given and 
how much is only high-school or even primary-school work: Much of the work in for- 
eign languages and the elementary phases of the physical sciences now given in Ameri- 
cancollegesisofthisnature. Thechild of6in the primary school reads ‘‘acat,’’ “‘ablack 
cat,” “it is my cat,” ‘‘I see the cat.’”’ At 18 the same child enters college and reads 
similar matter in German, French, or Spanish through a good part of a year and receives 
for it dignified college credits. The lessons in the primary school and in the college 
involve the same kind of work and require the same kind of mental ability. Much of 
the science work in our American colleges is also such work as should be done, and can 
be done, better in the high school or even in the elementary school. How much of 
this kind of work is done in the college under survey? To what extent does the college 
build its work on the high-school work accepted for admission? How well are its 
courses organized? How much of unity and continuity is there in them? What is the 
proportion of advanced work, second, third, and fourth year work, in the same subject 
or allied subjects, to single-year or even half-year work? These and other similar ques- 
tions must be asked and answered before standards can be determined with any degree 
of certainty. How well is the work of the individual students organized? What help 
do instructors give undergraduate students in organizing their work? Students should 
have the largest possible amount of intelligent freedom in making up their courses of 
study, but intelligent freedom requires much wise guidance. 
(16) What standing do students of the college take when going to other colleges of 
known standards? Is the work of the college accepted at its face value? It is espe- 
cially desirable to know what standing its graduate students have taken when entering 
standard schools for advanced work. Though this may be a narrow test, itis one of the 
most definite for any college which has sent many students on for graduate work. It 
is also one of the fairest. It reveals clearly the results of the policy of the college in 
admitting students and of its own work for its students through the full college course. 
(17) If the college has been established long, it may well be asked what part its 
graduates have performed in life and how well. President Gilman used to say that 
the work of a college at any period must be judged by the work that the students of 
that period have done and are doing 25 or 30 years later. A State university supported 
by all the people to prepare men and women to serve the State in every place in which 
knowledge and skill are required may well be judged by the fullness, variety, and 
efficiency of the service rendered by its graduates. 
(18) How well are courses of study of the college adapted to the purposes the college 
should serve and the conditions under which it must work? It is especially desirable 
to determine whether the income and equipment of the college are adequate to the 
work undertaken or advertised. College work of the best type now requires costly 
equipment. To hope to hold a place in the first rank, a college must now have a 
much larger income than was necessary only a few years ago. If the income is rela- 
tively small, the college must be content to offer a relatively small number of courses, 
and these of a kind that do not require large expenditures. Several of our larger in- 
stitutions now advertise more than one thousand courses. The University of Wis- 
consin ten years ago advertised an even one thousand. Only a generation ago few 
advertised more than two or three hundred. The larger number of courses is made 
necessary by the increase of knowledge and the complexity of modern life and should 
be offered by some at least of the larger and richer colleges, but from the multitude of 
possible subjects most colleges must select those which they are able to give and which 
are best adapted to their constituencies. Since a State constituted of the whole body 
of the people and representing all their interests and needs must assume the respon- 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXXVII 
sibility of supplying all its wants and may not transfer this responsibility to any part 
of the people less than the whole or to the possibilities and chances of private benevo- 
lences, the State university must, therefore, provide instruction in all subjects that 
are of vital interest to its people and the State must make it possible for it to do so. 
(19) The survey should make a careful inventory of the equipment of laboratories, 
shops, and libraries to determine to what extent they are adapted to the demands upon 
them and the work which the college should undertake to do through them, and 
should indicate clearly their shortcomings and needs. It should also include a careful 
inspection of buildings and grounds to determine their fitness for the purposes for 
which they are used, their sanitation, and the manner in which they are equipped. 
Attention should also be given to environment of the college and to the possibilities 
and means of improving this environment. Special attention should be given to the 
question whether the location of the college is such as to make it possible for it to succeed. 
in certain lines of work. Is it undertaking to maintain a medical school without the 
possibility of adequate clinics? Is itattempting to give advanced instruction in engi- 
neering without the possibility of pringing its students into contact with modern indus- 
trial plants? Isit undertaking to teach agriculture without sufficient and suitable land 
for agricultural experiments and demonstrations and without the possibility of constant 
observation of practical farming under normal conditions? Is it trying to prepare 
students for modern, democratic, social, and civic life witnin the walls of aristocratic or 
monastic seclusion? What provision, if any, is made for the nomes of members of the 
faculty and for students? That they may do their best work, both teachers and 
students should live comfortably and under wholesome sanitary conditions. What- 
ever affects the health, the strength, the vitality, the comfort, or the economy of time 
and effort of either students or teachers must be a matter of interest to the survey. 
* (20) What is the total necessary cost of attendance at college, including fees, living, 
and incidental expenses? Is this total cost kept well within the limits of the means 
of those who attend the college? What are the actual expenses of students? Are 
the actual expenses little or much in excess of the necessary minimum? Are the sons 
and daughters of the rich permitted without protest to introduce extravagant habits 
of living or is this discouraged? It is easily possible for the cost of living at college, 
including fees of one kind and another, to become so high as to keep away many who 
should, both for their own good and for the good of society and state, enter and remain 
until they graduate. When a college becomes a rich man’s club or the center of a 
dilettante society, its usefulness as a democratic institution is much impaired. While 
students and faculty alike should be able to live without stint of anything that may be 
necessary for the best work and the fullest life, the actual value of the work of any 
college will probably decrease in proportion as the expenses of either are in excess of 
this limit; more probably as the square or cube of this excess. What opportunities 
do the college and the community in which it is located offer students for profitable 
employment by which they may pay some portion of their college expenses when 
necessary? What attempts are made to induce all young men and women to get the 
benefit of the college regardless of their financial condition, if only they are willing 
to help themselves and are able to profit by attendance.at college? S 
(21) What relation does the college bear to the general system of public education 
(all agencies of education are public in its function and purpose) and to the several 
parts thereof? Does the college interest itself in the elementary schools, earnestly 
trying to foster their interests? What is its attitude toward the high schools? Is it 
preventing their full development by its own low standards, or is it imposing upon 
them the narrow and rigid limitations of college preparatory schools? Is the college 
striving to help high-school principals and teachers find just what is best for the 
schools charged with the education of a rapidly increasing number of boys and girls 
through the golden period of early and middle adolescence, and then wisely and 
patiently adjusting its own work to the results of these improved high-school courses,
-P-A-G-E-38
  XXXVIIL EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
so that more of those who go through the high school may be inspired or induced to 
enter college, while those who do not shall have gained from their years in the high 
school the best possible preparation for life? What is the relation of the college to 
other colleges within its territory, to professional and graduate schools? Is it help- 
fully sympathetic or is it hurtfully antagonistic? What attempts have been made 
toward desirable adjustments between the college and all other educational institu- 
tions to the end that the whole community served by them may receive the largest 
benefits? 
(22) What extension work does the college do? In what spirit is it done? Is it 
regarded as an opportunity for wider service or as a burden imposed? Issit organized 
as an integral part of the college work and inspired with the spirit and ideals of the 
college or is it disconnected, disjointed, and lifeless? Is it well chosen, arising out 
of the needs of the community, or has it been adopted in imitation of some other 
college that has won reputation for such work? What facilities has the college for its 
extension work? Isitsincome sufficient to enable it to do this work without detracting 
from the value of its legitimate intramural work? The campus of the modern college 
should be as large as the territory it serves. Wherever people labor in the sunshine 
or toil in the shadows, wherever they are attempting to do any legitimate work which 
requires an understanding of fundamental principles and the guidance which the 
college may give, there it should be of service. But no college should undertake 
work for which it is unprepared outside its walls at the expense of the legitimate 
work which it is already doing within its walls. To determine what extension work 
it should undertake, or if any at all, is not always an easy task for the college. The 
survey should assist it in arriving at a wise decision. 
(23) What are the possibilities of growth for the college? In what direction should 
it extend its work? Is its income sufficient for its present needs and its future growth? 
Can this income be increased? Are the present sources of income sufficient to respond. 
to new demands? What other sources of income are available or can be made avail- 
able? What changes in the college and its work may and can be made to enable it to 
demand and obtain the larger income which it should have? These and other similar 
questions the survey must answer or put the college in the way of answering for itself 
if it is to result in much good. The final value of the survey will depend not only 
on the keenness with which it analyzes conditions and the justness and fairness with 
which it points out weaknesses and failures, it will depend also on the fullness and. 
helpfulness of its constructive recommendations and suggestions. It is not enough 
for the physician to diagnose a case, however thoroughly and accurately; he must 
also prescribe the remedy if his services are to be of much value. The college survey 
committees must be able both to diagnose and to prescribe. To this end, I repeat, 
every such committee should be made up of men and women who have power to con- 
tribute to the work of the committee in both respects. Critics who can merely detect 
faults have their place, no doubt, but it is not in connection with high constructive 
work like this. Here, as in every other place, we must doubt the value of the judg- 
ment of men who can not also do. We all value most the criticism of those who are 
possessed of the knowledge that comes from experience and have proven the soundness 
of their judgment by the success of the work in which it has been applied. 
Of such surveys as I have here attempted to describe and of which I have attempted 
to point out some of the elements, I believe we may not have too many. To asurvey 
undertaken by competent persons in this spirit, I believe, no self-respecting college 
will object. 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

CHAPTER I. 
GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1914.1 
By W. Carson Ryan, Jr., 
Editor, Bureau of Education. 
GENERAL GROWTH. 
In round numbers there were 22,000,000 persons enrolled in edu- 
cational institutions in the United States in 1914. Of these over 
19,000,000 were in elementary schools; 1,374,000 in secondary 
schools, both public and private; and 216,000 in colleges and uni- 
versities. Close to another hundred thousand were in normal 
schools preparing to be teachers, 67,000 were in professional schools, 
and the remainder were scattered through other types of institu- 
tions. The teachers for this educational army numbered 700,000, 
of whom 566,000 were in public schools. In point of rapid growth 
the public high school still presents the most impressive figures; 
the enrollment for 1914 is greater by over 84,000 than for the year 
before. 
THE COST OF EDUCATION. 
The cost of education for the year, as nearly as can bo estimated, 
was $750,000,000. This three-quarters of a billion is a relatively 
small amount when compared with other items in the public expense. 
It is less by $300,000,000 than the cost of running the Federal Goy- 
ernment; it is less than one-third the Nation’s expenditure for alco- 
holic liquors; it is only a little over three times the estimated cost 
of admissions to moving-picture theaters in the United States for 
the same year. Measured in terms of products of the soil, the United 
States spent somewhat more for education in 1914 than the value of 
its cotton crop, somewhat less than the value of its wheat crop, and 
less than half the value of the annual harvest of corn; while the 
Nation’s bill for education was less by nearly a hundred millions than 
the value of the exports from the harbor of New York in the calen- 
dar year just passed.   
1 The purpose of this chapter is to present a summary statement of current educational progress as indi- 
cated by information available in the Bureau of Education. For detailed accounts the reader is specifi- 
cally referred to the various chapters in the two volumes of the report, upon which this review is almost 
entirely based.

  2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
ENROLLMENT, SCHOOL POPULATION, AND LENGTH OF TERM. 
It is estimated that there were 25,587,331 children of school age 
(5 to 18) in 1913, as compared with 25,167,445 in 1912. The enroll- 
ment of elementary and secondary pupils increased from 19,922,261 
in 1912 to 20,431,609 in 1913. General and school population both 
remain predominantly rural. By the census estimates for 1913, 46.3 
per cent of the population was urban and 53.7 per cent rural, if the . 
census definition of a city as anything over 2,500 population be ac- 
cepted. In population 6 to 20 years of age the cities have 41.6 per 
cent of the total, as compared with 58.4 per cent for the rural dis- 
tricts. 
Very little increase is yet to be noted in the average term for 
public schools. Between 1910 and 1913 the increase was from 157.5 
days a year to 158.1—a growth of only six-tenths of a day in three 
years. Attendance has improved, however. The average number 
of days attended by each person enrolled increased from 113 in 1910 
to 115.6 in 1913. 
CITY SCHOOLS. 
School administration, particularly in cities, is becoming more 
and more of a science, and the office of superintendent of schools a 
profession. This is becoming true even in the smaller cities and 
towns; 614 out of 756 superintendents in cities below 25,000 popu- 
lation say that their school boards are disposed to give them more 
power. There is still uncertainty of tenure about the office, however. 
Between 1911 and 1913 there were 348 changes of superintendents 
in cities between 4,000 and 25,000 population. That the smaller 
city problem merits the special attention it is receiving may be seen 
from the fact that in 1913 there were only 229 cities of more than 
25,000 population, while there were 2,173 cities between 2,500 and 
25,000 containing one-third of the total urban school population. 
In the larger cities the three most prominent topics in superintend- 
ents’ reports of the year relate to ‘‘definiteness in supervision, 
changes in grade organization, and vocational training.’’ Men- 
tioned frequently in city school reports is wider use of the school 
plant. The survey movement shows little abatement; of the nine 
formal school surveys reported for the year, six dealt with city school 
systems. 
“THE RURAL SCHOOL. 
The main lines of rural school progress during the year have 
centered about the problem of a larger unit of administration and 
supervision, the movement for consolidation or centralization of 
schools, and efforts for equalization of educational opportunity by
-P-A-G-E-41
  
GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 3 
State aid. The county system of administration was. adopted for 
Ohio in 1914. With Wisconsin, which changed from the district 
system in 1913, there are now 18 States having a more or less defi- 
nitely organized county system of schools. In addition, several 
other States have the county unit of taxation.’ 
Special activity in consolidation of schools is reported from Ala- 
bama, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Ohio. 
Consolidation has not yet operated to reduce the total number of 
schoolhouses in the United States, however, which increased from 
265,474 in 1910 to 277,148 in 1913. 
Investigations of the year have emphasized the fact that the 
rural-school problem is not confined to any one section, though 
the Southern States, with an overwhelmingly rural population, 
at present show the most active efforts for improvement. New 
York State reports that of the 11,642 elementary schools in the 
State 8,430 are one-room schools; that in 3,580 of these the average 
attendance was 10 or less; and in nearly half the maximum tax 
yield at 1 per cent for school purposes would be $400. Of Colorado’s 
1,725 ‘‘third-class” school districts 281 contain fewer than 15 chil- 
dren of school age. 
CHILDREN OF PRESCHOOL AGE. 
Unmistakable signs of new interest in the special problem of the 
education of very young children are at hand. A partial indication 
is to be found in the vigorous growth of kindergartens since 1912, 
the last year for which figures were gathered. 
Between 1912 and 1914 the number of cities or villages having 
public kindergartens increased from 867 to 1,135. There were 
7,365 kindergartens in 1912, with 364,189 children, and 8,856 teach- 
ers. The 1914 figures show 8,825 separate kindergartens, 465,868 
children enrolled, and 10,569 kindergarten teachers. It is still true, 
however, that less than half the cities in the United States have 
kindergartens, and the rural school is as yet little touched by kin- 
dergarten influence. From the pedagogical side the dominant note of 
the year is the movement for the integration of kindergarten work 
with that of the grades and the reorganization of kindergarten train- 
ing schools to facilitate this integration. 
The Montessori movement has not yet made any appreciable ad- 
vance in number of schools, but has already exercised a considerable 
influence in two directions—in stimulating kindergarten teachers to 
a profitable reexamination of Froebelian theory and practice, and in 
calling attention generally to the significant and special problem 
involved in the education of children of preschool age.   
1 More recently (1915) Utah has made her optional county administration system mandatory, and Texas 
has greatly extended the powers and duties of the county boards of education in all counties.

  4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Statistics for 1914 emphasize the fact that private elementary 
schools in the United States are now confined almost entirely to church 
schools. The parish school system of the Catholic Church in 1914 
comprised 5,403 schools, with 1,429,859 pupils, an increase of 147 
schools and 69,098 pupils over the year 1913. Part of this abnormal 
increase is due to the inclusion for the first time of the Ruthenian 
Greek Catholics in Roman Catholic population figures. 
The Lutheran parochial school system for 1914 reported 4,881 
schools, 3,825 teachers, and 259,467 pupils. This is an increase in 
teachers, but a decrease in schools and pupils. It is estimated that 
20 out of every 100 Lutheran children of school age attend a Lutheran 
parochial school, as compared with 21 in every 100 for 1913. The 
parochial school has apparently disappeared from the oldest of the 
general bodies of the American Lutheran Church, the General Synod. 
Higher and secondary educational institutions still remain the 
stronghold of denominational education. Of 567 colleges and univer- 
sities tabulated in this report, 327 are listed under denominational 
control; and of the 2,199 private high schools and academies report- 
ing, 1,489 were under the control of religious denominations. These 
secondary institutions are maintained by 28 different denominations 
and have 8,762 instructors and 101,329 students. In the Catholic 
system special emphasis has been placed on secondary education; 
there were 863 Catholic high schools in 1914. 
HIGH SCHOOLS, 
There were 13,714 public and private high schools in 1914, with 
1,373,661 students. The number of students was an increase of 
90,652 over the preceding year and an increase of more than 100 per 
cent since 1902. Encouraging features are the increased numberof 
high schools having full four-year courses, and the constant better- 
ment in the proportion of students completing the high-school course. 
In 1914 the fourth-year students numbered 194,704, or 14.27 per cent, 
of the total enrollment, as compared with 13.94 per cent in 1913, and 
11.68 per cent in 1907. Of the 11,515 public high schools, 8,275 have 
four-year courses. These four-year high schools contain 1,126,456 
students, or 92.42 per cent of the public high-school enrollment, as 
compared with 91.21 per cent in 1913 and 88.3 per cent in 1911. 
Public high-school students were 88.73 per cent of the total number of 
public and private high-school students in 1914, as compared with 
88.45 per cent in 1913, and 68.13 per cent in 1890. The number of 
girls exceeded the number of boys in both public and private second- 
ary schools in 1914, the number of girls having increased in slightly 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  
GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 5 
greater proportion; 56.03 per cent were girls in 1914, asagainst 55.46 
in 1913. 
The junior high school, defined tentatively as ‘‘an organization of 
grades 7 and 8 or 7 to 9, to provide by various means for individual 
differences, especially by an earlier introduction of prevocational work 
and of subjects usually taught in the high schools,” was endorsed by 
all but one of the school surveys published during the year, and 
by various educational associations. That the movement has ad- 
vanced from the stage of theory to that of practice is indicated in the 
fact that 168 cities claim to have junior high schools, and after all 
deductions are made there remain 57 cities where junior high schools 
are organized in unmistakable form. 
“Reorganizing high schools to meet the needs of all the people, 
chiefly through vocational subjects,” is the note that runs through the 
reports of State high-school authorities in practically all the States. 
Introduction of vocational work, particularly agriculture in rural com- 
munities, is specifically mentioned by 25 out of 36 State departments 
answering an inquiry as to the most important development in high- 
school work in their States. 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
There were 216,493 students in colleges, universities, and techno- 
logical schools in 1914, an increase of 14,262 over 1913. The bureau’s 
list for 1914 includes 567 institutions, a decrease of 29 over the pre- 
ceding year. States or municipalities control 93 of the colleges; 
private corporations control 474. Men still outnumber women in 
higher education; there were 139,373 men in 1914 and 77,120 women, 
as compared with 128,644 men and 73,587 women in 1913. Despite 
rising standards of admission and graduation, college enrollment has 
more than tripled since 1890. 
Receipts during the year totaled $120,579,257, of which $18,422,856 
was for endowment. Benefactions to colleges and universities 
totaled $26,670,017, something over $2,000,000 more than in the 
year previous. In the past seven years the largest increase in income 
has come through State and municipal appropriations, and the 
smallest from tuition and other fees. State and municipal appro- 
priations grew from $9,649,549 in 1908 to $23,400,540 in 1914, while 
fees for tuition and other educational services increased from 
$15,390,847 to $22,504,529. 
The dominant note of the year in higher education is concentra- 
tion, both in internal organization and in relation to State authority. 
The movement in the direction of authoritative classification gained 
momentum during the year, chiefly through the activities of several 
voluntary associations. The junior-college movement has reached  
-P-A-G-E-44
    6 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the point where three States—Wisconsin, Missouri, and Virginia 1— 
have gone on record as definitely recognizing junior colleges in the 
educational system of the State. The Municipal University of Akron, 
Ohio, was added to the list of city universities, and the new ‘‘Asso- 
ciation of Urban Universities,” established in the fall of 1914, lends 
emphasis to this municipal-university development. 
Degrees conferred by colleges and universities included 26,533 
baccalaureate, 5,248 graduate, and 749 honorary. The degree of 
doctor of philosophy was conferred as the result of examination by 
46 institutions on 446 men and 73 women. 
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
As a result of the vigorous campaigns for better standards waged 
during the past few years, the number of ‘‘professional schools” 
reported by the Bureau of Education is decreasing materially. The 
number of institutions listed as professional schools in 1914 was 
542, as compared with 556 in 1913. There was a falling off of 3 
schools of theology, 2 law schools, 8 schools of medicine, and 3 schools 
of pharmacy. There was an increase of 2 in the number of dental 
schools. The number of students in professional schools increased 
from 65,585 to 66,873. Practically all of this increase was in the 
schools .of dentistry, where there were 9,315 students, as compared 
with 8,015 in 1913, an evidence of the increasing interest in dental 
hygiene as part of the public program for good health. Graduates 
in law in 1914 numbered 4,496; in medicine, 4,048; in pharmacy, 
2,290; in dentistry, 2,270; and in theology, 1,886. Engineering is 
not yet classed as a profession in the statistics of the Bureau of 
Education. 
Receipts by professional schools in 1914 totaled $19,608,761, of 
which $11,450,393 was for medicine, $4,246,501 for theology, 
$1,831,163 for law, and $1,114,634 for schools of dentistry. 
Nowhere has the insistence upon standards been so vigorous and 
the results so convincing as in medical education. There are now 34 
medical schools requiring two or more years of college work for 
admission, and 50 requiring one year; in 38 of these the new regula- 
tion went into effect for the first time in 1914. There are now only 
17 medical colleges that admit students on high-school education or 
less. 
The growth in professional standards in legal education is almost 
equally noteworthy. Of the 122 law schools in the United States, 6 
now require college graduation for entrance; at least 8 require two 
years of college work; and a large number require one year. There 
has been a corresponding lengthening of the law course. Of the 122

-P-A-G-E-45
GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 7 
law schools listed this year by the Bureau of Education, 1 still 
reports a one-year course; 17 report courses of two years; all others 
require at least three years. The law schools had 1,471 instructors 
and 20,958 students in 1914, an increase of 80 students over the 
previous year. 
TEACHER TRAINING. 
No figures are available to show the exact number of graduates of 
professional training courses for teachers who entered the profession 
in 1914, but some approximation is possible. Graduates of normal 
schools, most of whom are destined for teaching in the elementary 
schools, numbered 20,658 for the year; it is estimated that 15,000 
went into the rural schools from teacher-training courses in high 
schools; and about 5,000 were graduated from college after taking 
courses in education, most of these teaching in high schools. Add to 
these a few hundred in graduate courses, destined chiefly for college 
teaching, and it seems safe to say that between forty and fifty thousand 
new teachers began work in the fall of 1914 with at least a measure 
of professional preparation. 
It is practically impossible to make any reliable deductions from 
this as to the present proportion of trained teachers in the schools, 
since estimates of the average length of the teacher’s career vary 
greatly; but it is clear that the supply of professionally prepared 
teachers is not yet sufficient for the number of teaching positions that 
must be filled every year. The need is felt most keenly in the rural 
schools; it is also felt in the high schools, where the requirement 
of special pedagogical training is now being added to that of college 
graduation, and States are offering subsidies, especially for teachers 
in vocational subjects. It is noteworthy that between 1910 and 1914 
the number of institutions engaged in training teachers increased 
from 1,397 to 1,620, and the students in these schools from 115,277 
to 122,446, the latter figure not including students in colleges and 
universities. The whole teacher-training situation is rendered still 
more encouraging by the continued remarkable development of 
summer-school work; of the more than two hundred thousand per- 
sons in attendance at all kinds of summer schools in 1914, it is esti- 
mated that fully one-third were teachers intent upon bettering their 
professional preparation. ' 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
There were 281 normal schools reporting to the Bureau of Educa- 
tion in 1914, as compared with 283 the preceding year. Of these, 235 
were public normal schools, including 67 training schools in 59 cities. 
Students in normal schools in 1914 numbered 95,286, as compared 
with 94,455 the year before; and 84,095 in 1911. Five new public  
-P-A-G-E-46
  8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
normal schools appear on the list, and eight private normal schools 
were dropped because of failure to report or because they are known 
to have ceased to exist. Since 1910 the number of public normal 
schools has increased from 223 to 235 and the number of private 
schools has decreased from 65 to 46; while the number of students in 
public normal schools has grown from 75,642 to 89,537, and the num- 
ber in private normal schools has diminished from 8,453 to 5,749. 
The 20,658 graduates of public and private normal schools in 1914 
represented a net decrease of 114 from 1913. 
Public appropriations for normal schools totaled $12,523,968 for 
the year, as compared with $10,432,252 last year and $2,212,952 
a quarter of a century ago. With the complete recognition of 
teacher training as a public function has come a certain dissatisfac- 
tion with the manner in which normal schools have exercised that 
function, and the whole problem of teacher training is undergoing 
investigation in several States. 
TEACHER TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The urgent need for rural teachers has caused a rapid development 
in high-school teacher-training courses. In 1914 public high schools 
to the number of 1,051 were reported as engaged in the work of pre- 
paring teachers, and 21,076 students in these schools were taking the 
training course. This is an increase since 1911. of 440 schools and 
6,396 students. Maryland and Ohio established teacher training 
in public high schools by legislative act in 1914. Two hundred and 
eighty-eight miscellaneous institutions classed by the bureau as ‘‘pri- 
vate high schools,”’ but including a number of ‘‘normal and indis- 
trial institutes” also reported that they were training teachers in 
1914; they registered 6,084 students in pedagogical courses. 
COLLEGE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
Schools of education or departments of pedagogy are reported by 
352 out of the.567 colleges and universities listed by the Bureau of 
Education in 1914. It is difficult to ascertain the number of students 
taking professional work. Many college students proposing to teach 
take a course in methods for their particular subject; such persons 
are professionally trained to a very definite degree, but they would 
probably not be reported in any enumeration of students in educa- 
tion. The attempt made to get this information, which was collected 
by the bureau prior to 1911, will be resumed in 1915. Of special 
significance in the development of education as a university subject 
is the change of Teachers College, Columbia University, into a gradu- 
ate school, which went into effect in 1914.

GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
  Vocational training as a national problem attracted special atten- 
tion by the report of the commision on Federal aid for vocational 
education, rendered in June, 1914. While the comprehensive bill 
drawn up by the commission was not acted upon by Congress, 
favorable action is considered likely soon. Congress had already 
voted the Federal aid asked for in the Smith-Lever bill for agricul- 
tural extension education. 
THE SMITH-HUGHES BILL. 
The Smith-Hughes bill, which formed the report of the commission, 
but, as noted, did not pass, would have provided Federal aid to 
public supported and controlled schools of less than college grade 
for training teachers for agricultural education, trade and industrial 
education, and home economics, and for paying part of the salaries 
of supervisors and directors of agricultural subjects and teachers 
of trade and industrial education. A Federal board of industrial 
education was proposed, to consist of five members—the Secretary 
of Agriculture, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce, 
the Secretary of the Interior, and the Postmaster General, with the 
Commissioner of Education as executive officer. The appropriation 
for trade and industrial schools was to be $500,000 the first year, 
increasing to $3,000,000 annuaily; similarly for agricultural schools. 
For teacher training $500,000 was to be appropriated the first year, 
increasing to $1,000,000 in 1918-19, and remaining at that amount. 
For every dollar of Federal aid the State or local communities would 
be required to expend an equal amount, besides meeting all main- 
tenance costs. The States were to create or designate State boards 
to handle the funds in the several States. 
THE STATES AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
In the various States the progress of the year has been chiefly that 
of holding gains already made and working out in practice the legis- 
lation previously provided. The six States having definite systems 
for organizing and supervising vocational schools and for lending State 
aid to local communities—Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Indiana—have all been busy setting 
up the machinery of administration and extending the operation of 
the system in additional schools and classes. In each of the States 
mentioned the vocational schools have been placed under the direction ° 
of a special deputy or expert assistant, attached to the staff of the 
State superintendent or commissioner of education. Connecticut is 
developing a system of industrial schools, and California has begun 
the organization of a division of vocational education in charge of a
-P-A-G-E-48
10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
commissioner of vocational education. New Mexico and Maine also 
have vocational or industrial divisions in their State departments of 
education. Several other States have for some time been getting 
ready to organize State systems of vocational education, but have not 
been able to decide as to the precise form of organization best suited 
to their needs. 
The most serious problem encountered by communities that have 
sought to enlarge their facilities for vocational training during the year 
has been that of procuring teachers who are proficient in the trade 
to be taught and at the same time with professional training or expe- 
rience. 
Noteworthy in the cities is the tendency toward careful community 
study for the purpose of securing a definite knowledge of conditions 
upon which to base an industrial education program. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
Courses in agriculture were reported by 1,677 high schools in 1914, 
an increase of 263 over 1913. Students taking these courses num- 
bered 34,367, or 4,552 more than the year before. Some of this high- 
school work is definitely vocational; most of it, however, comprises 
brief textbook courses extending from a quarter to afullyear. Special 
efforts have recently been put forth, by means of home projects and 
otherwise, to give a definite vocational bent to agriculture as taught 
in high schools. In addition to the 48 State colleges of agriculture 
there are now 7 other colleges and universities giving agricultural 
courses of college grade. In both college and high-school work there 
has been increased emphasis on the practical side of farming as 
opposed to ‘book agriculture.’’ The extension work stimulated by 
the passage of the Smith-Lever bill in May, 1914, is now making rapid 
headway. - 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
Students in public and private high schools and independent com- 
mercial schools numbered 346,770 in 1914, an increase of 16,231 over 
the year before. Business and commercial courses were given in 
2,191 public high schools, and in 723 private secondary schools. The 
704 business schools for which statistics are available reported 
168,063 students. There are more than 1,300 such schools on the 
lists of the Bureau of Education, however; the remaining schools do 
not respond to requests for statistical information. Recent develop- 
ments in this field have emphasized on the one hand the demand for 
a more systematic and practical secondary-school training for com- 
mercial pursuits, and on the other hand the importance of a higher 
professional education for business in institutions of college and 
university grade.
-P-A-G-E-49
  GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 11 
EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 
Education for home-making and household arts, ranging from 
cooking and sewing in the elementary school to graduate courses in 
the universities, has made measurable progress during the year. 
Definitely organized courses in household arts were reported in 1914 
by 252 colleges, 159 public normal schools, 2,440 high schools, and 
3,082 cities, towns, and villages. The 66,914 students in the 1,345 
high schools reporting in 1913 increased to 79,240 students in the 1,655 
public high schools reporting the number of students in household arts 
courses in 1914, and it is estimated that the approximately 7,500 
college and university students taking home-economics courses in 1912 
had increased to 12,000. Only a small part of any of this work is at 
present on a real vocational basis, but the trend of the year has been 
toward emphasis on the practical in all types of home-economics work. 
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE. 
In the cities where investigations preparatory to the introduction 
of vocational training have been made attention has quite generally 
been paid to the problem of vocational guidance, and vocation bureaus 
have usually accompanied or followed the establishment of vocational 
courses. Philadelphia’s new official is director of vocational education 
and guidance. Significant of the progress of the movement is the 
taking over by the public schools in whole or in part of the function of 
vocational counseling. The present emphasis appears to be upon 
the fact that vocational guidance in public education is not a simple 
problem of analysis and placement, but involves consideration 
throughout the child’s school life of the problem of future employ- 
ment. According to a preliminary investigation recently made by the 
Bureau of Education about a hundred public high schools, represent- 
ing some 40 cities, had definitely organized, conscious plans of voca- 
tional guidance in 1914, through vocation bureaus, consultation com- 
mittees, vocation analysts, trial vocational courses, systematic visits 
to industrial plants, or regular courses in vocations. The National 
Vocational Guidance Association, growing out of the national confer- 
ences on vocational guidance which had been held since 1910, was 
formally organized during the year. 
HEALTH SUPERVISION. 
Medical inspection is reported by 704 cities of over 5,000 popula- 
tion, out of 1,063 replying to a questionnaire. Of these 704 cities, 
402 have school nurses, numbering in all 911. In 140 cities the board 
of education provides the nurses; in 50 cities it is the board of health 
that provides them; and in 212 cities other agencies—usually private 
philanthropies—make possible the nurse service in connection with
-P-A-G-E-50
  12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
medical or health inspection. Noteworthy is the spread of the health 
supervision movement to the smaller cities. Of the 1,300 cities 
between 2,500 and 30,000 population, 516 report medical inspection 
in some form, and 86 have school nurses; more than half of these, 
however, are in the few States where medical inspection is mandatory 
by State law. 
School clinics to the number of 141 were reported in 1914 by city 
school superintendents; 109 of these are dental clinics. Psychological 
clinics are reported from 64 cities. 
Investigations made during the year have driven home the fact 
that rural school children are more in need of health supervision than, 
city children, and recent attention has been devoted more particularly 
to the rural problem. 
EDUCATION FOR SPECIAL CLASSES OF CHILDREN. 
The magnitude of the problem of the handicapped child and the 
extent to which the States have taken over the burden of his educa- 
tion are indicated in the statistics for special schools collected by the 
Bureau of Education. The 62 public schools for the blind report 665 
teachers, 4,971 pupils, and an aggregate expenditure of $2,563,173 for 
the year 1914. Of the 151 schools for the deaf listed by the bureau, 
68 are State schools, 65 public day schools, and 18 are private schools. 
There are 13,859 pupils taught by 1,689 teachers. The expenditure 
of the 68 State schools for the deaf in 1914 was $3,777,162. 
State schools for feeble-minded children numbered 38; these are 
confined to 28 States, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and 
Pennsylvania each having three or more separate schools. There are 
also 25 private schools for feeble-minded children. State schools 
reported 381 instructors and 2,328 assistants, with 27,692 inmates, 
of whom 14,880 were actually under instruction. Expenditures for 
schools for the feeble-minded amounted to nearly $6,000,000. Public 
day schools for subnormal children were reported from 54 cities. 
Thirty-six cities in 24 States made provision for exceptional children 
for the first time in 1913; and 162 cities in 34 States extended the 
provision already made. Special training for teachers of exceptional 
children is now provided in a score or more of institutions of college 
and university grade. 
There are 112 institutions listed by the Bureau of Education as 
State “industrial” schools. These are schools for delinquents of 
both sexes, ranging from reform schools of the prison type to modern 
well-equipped industrial schools for the teaching of useful trades. 
There are 1,052 teachers, 3,085 assistants who are not teachers, and 
54,798 inmates in these institutions, of whom four-fifths are boys. 
Of the 21,665 boys and girls committed to institutions during the
-P-A-G-E-51
  GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 13 
year, 2,635 could neither read nor write; of the 22,068 discharged 
during the year, 1,962 could neither read nor write. 
LIBRARIES. 
There were 2,849 libraries of more than 5,000 volumes in the United 
States in 1913, an increase of 551 over 1908, the last previous year 
for which data were collected. The number of volumes reported from 
all libraries in 1913 was 75,112,935, as compared with 55,350,163 in 
1908. Of the 2,849 libraries containing 5,000 volumes or over, 1,844 
are classified as ‘‘public and society libraries,” and 1,005 are school 
and college libraries. Public and society libraries have an aggregate 
of over fifty million volumes, with seven million borrowers’ cards in 
force; 1,446 of these libraries were entirely free to the public. 
Libraries reporting from 1,000 to 5,000 volumes in 1913 numbered 
5,453, of which 2,188 were public and society libraries, and 3,265 school 
libraries. These libraries contained 11,689,942 volumes. Another 
group of still smaller libraries, comprising those that reported from 
300 to 1,000 volumes, increased the total by 2,961,007 volumes. In 
all there are now some 18,000 libraries on the lists of the Bureau of 
Education. 
The distribution of library facilities is still uneven, however. More 
than half of the 1,844 public and.society libraries reported for the 
entire United States were in the North Atlantic States, and they con- 
tained 24,627,921 volumes out of the total of 50,000,000; while of 
the 3,000,000 volumes added to library collections in 1913 almost 
one-half were for the same section. 
Library activity in 1913-14 was marked by considerable extension 
of the branch system, particularly in the granting of library privi- 
leges on the part of cities to neighboring suburban communities; by 
further development of the county library plan in many States; and 
in general by a visible growth in the spirit of service that is charac- 
teristic of many of the formal educational institutions of to-day. 
The period of the library as a mere storehouse of books seems to be 
safely past; it has yielded to a period of direct community service. 
OTHER EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. 
The same spirit that has made the library open wide its doors to all 
the people has caused the museums and art galleries of the country 
to unlock their treasures and seek in many instances to occupy a very 
direct relation to the organized educational agencies of the commu- 
nity. Grading off from institutions like these are many other agen- 
cies and organizations of whose work little statistical record is kept 
from year to year at the Bureau of Education or elsewhere, but whose 
direct educational influence must in the aggregate be enormous. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
There are the 300 educational associations, many of them, like the Na- 
tional Education Association and its branches, doing direct work in 
the professional education of teachers and school superintendents; 
others, like the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial 
Education, carrying on a propaganda for education among the gen- 
eral public; and still others, like the Public Education Associations 
of New York and Philadelphia, investigating city conditions and _ 
stimulating an interest in education among the people of the local 
community. Organizations like the Russell Sage Foundation, the 
New York Bureau of Municipal Research, the Carnegie Foundation, 
and the General Education Board, have brought into the work of 
education the welcome influence of an impersonal, scientific judg- 
ment. No record of the year in education would be complete that 
did not pay tribute to the work these organizations and others of the 
kind are doing. 
Colleges, universities, and normal schools are going far beyond 
their own walls in carrying education to the local communities. 
Nearly half the colleges in the United States did extension work last 
year. The Federal Government itself is realizing, as never before, 
the desirability of a wide distribution of the scientific information it 
has collected at large expense of time and money, and many of the 
bulletins and circulars issued by the Government are now affecting 
directly the everyday procedure of education. The Boys’ and Girls’ 
Club work in the Department of Agriculture and the circular letter 
service of the Bureau of Education illustrate two different types of 
the information service of the Federal Government, both of recent 
development. In the two years ending June 30, 1914, the Bureau of 
Education issued 112 numbers of its Bulletin, representing about a 
' million separate copies, and covering nearly every phase of educa- 
tional endeavor for the direct benefit of school officials. 
A host of other organizations making no claim to a place in the 
formal school system aré nevertheless doing active work of a directly 
educational nature. The Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the Camp Fire 
Girls, women’s clubs, parent-teacher associations, musical societies, 
art centers; these are doing a work whose educational importance is 
only beginning to be apprehended. The influence of the fraternal 
organizations is directly educative. The whole vast field of religious 
instruction in churches and Sunday schools represents an educational 
problem that is seldom viewed as such because of the larger spiritual 
issues that are felt to be involved, and because of the traditional sepa- 
ration of church and state in America. Chautauquas, farmers’ insti- 
tutes, lecture courses, the Grange, Young Men’s Christian Association 
and Young Women’s Christian Association, social settlements, sum- 
mer camps, the periodical and newspaper press—these are as truly 
educational agencies as the schools.

  GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 15 
EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE OF THE YEAR. 
Much of the significant contribution to educational literature dur- 
ing the year is to be found in the formal reports of investigations and 
surveys. The Canadian report on. industrial education, referred to 
elsewhere in this chapter, the findings of the Hanus inquiry in New 
York City, and the Carnegie Foundation report on education in Ver- 
mont are typical of this comparatively new type of educational lit- 
erature. Some of the city surveys are notable educational docu- 
ments. In somewhat the same category of general survey material 
might be placed ‘“‘The General Education Board, 1902-1914,” a care- 
fully written account of the board’s activities to date; the two-volume 
report of the Federal Commission on Aid for Vocational Education, 
the second volume of which epitomizes current American opinion on 
the subject; and the report of the English board of education on 
“School.and Employment in the United States.’ 
In the domain of more formal educational writing should be men- 
tioned Graves, ‘A History of Education in Modern Times”; Thorn- 
dike’s three volumes on Educational Psychology; and several influen- 
tial books growing out of the New York inquiry—Hanus’s ‘School 
Efficiency”; McMurry’s “‘Elementary School Standards”; Ballou’s 
“High School Organization”; and Moore’s ‘‘Indispensable Require- 
ments in City School Administration.” The many books in the voca- 
tional field include Albert H. Leake’s ‘Industrial Education,’ 
Snedden’s ‘‘Problems of Educational Readjustment,” and E. G. 
Cooley’s much discussed volume on “Industrial Education in Europe.” 
Prof. John Dewey’s recent writing, which has exerted considerable 
influence in the discussion of vocational training, has appeared mainly 
in brief periodical articles. Monroe’s monumental Cyclopedia of 
Education was brought to completion during the year. Two books 
on higher education that appeared are Sharpless, ‘“‘The American 
College” and Thwing, ‘“‘The American College, What it is and What 
it may Become.” 
The'rural school discussion has given us many books of method 
during the year, especially rural school arithmetics, farm life readers, 
and textbooks on agriculture; general books on rural life designed 
for teachers; and two or three books dealing in a significant way with 
the attempt to relate the rural school to country life: Eggleston and 
Bruere’s ‘“ Work of the Rural School”; Cubberley, ‘Rural Life and 
Education”; Betts and Hall, ‘‘ Better Rural Schools”; and Harold W. 
Foght’s illuminating interpretation of rural Denmark. Important 
evaluations of the rural school movements have been given by A. C. 
Monahan in his ‘‘Consolidation of Rural Schools,’ and ‘County Unit 
Organization for the Administration of Rural Schools.”  
-P-A-G-E-54
  16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Madame Montessori’s ‘‘ Pedagogical Anthropology,” in which her 
educational theories are set forth more in detail than in her previous 
work, appeared in English for the first time during the year. Cur- 
rent movements in secondary education are represented by Prof. 
Monroe’s Principles of Secondary Education (‘‘written by a number 
of specialists”), and Prof. Johnston’s symposium on High-School 
Education. Terman’s “Health of the School Child” represents a 
useful addition to the list of books on school hygiene. Notable 
among the publications of the year in this field are the proceedings of 
the Fourth International Congress of School Hygiene. The theory 
and practice of the kindergarten are stated from several points of — 
view in the report of the Committee of Nineteen of the International 
peaidergarven Union, published under the title of ‘‘The Kinder- 
garten.” 
EDUCATION IN THE TERRITORIES AND INSULAR POSSESSIONS. 
Reports covering the year 1913-14 show that education in the 
Territories and insular possessions of the United States is making 
notable progress, the development on the industrial side offering, in 
the case of Porto Rico and the Philippines particularly, valuable 
lessons for the various States. 
The schools for natives maintained by the United States Govern- 
ment in Alaska comprise 70 schools, with an enrollment of 3,666 
pupils. There were 43 schools for whites in Alaska under Territorial 
control. 
The Territory of Hawaii reported 33,288 pupils of all nationalities 
in the schools in 1913-14, an increase of 350 over 1913. Private- 
school enrollment decreased by 1,009, while public-school enrollment 
increased 1,359. The public-school system in the Territory included 
168 schools; 713 teachers, of whom 200 are Americans; and 26,090 
pupils, with an average attendance of 25,019. Hawaii’s expenditures 
for education in 1914 were $742,310, an increase of $65,000 over 1913, 
and double the expenditure for 1901. 
Enrollment in the schools of the Philippine Islands was 252, 959 
for September, 1914, an increase of about 100,000 over the year 
before. The increased enroliment was made possible by better 
provision for buildings; between March, 1913, and September, 1914, 
the number of schoolhouses increased from 2,934 to 4,304. The 
special development of industrial instruction fitted to local needs has 
proceeded vigorously since the systematizing of the work in 1910, 
when a plan was adopted designed ‘‘to increase industrial efficiency 
and create an educated class in sympathetic touch with labor and the 
development of the community.”

GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. et 
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
The international character of education has recently been empha- 
sized by the severance of bonds of science and scholarship that had 
existed so long as to seem virtually indestructible. The outbreak of 
war in Europe found the nations in the midst of an era of con- 
structive achievement in education. Measures pending during 
1913-14 have for the most part been deferred; this very fact, however, 
makes it possible to evaluate to some extent what is now a com- 
pleted chapter in educational progress. It is significant that the 
lines of achievement are much the samein the leading civilized nations; 
these are mainly the spread of elementary educational advantages 
to all classes of the population; provision for vocational training by 
public agencies; and conservation of the health of school children. 
The report of the Canadian Royal Coramission on Industrial Train- 
ing and Technical Education, appointed in 1910, was completed during 
the year; it is an admirable addition to the world-wide surveys of in- 
dustry and education that are characteristic of our time. Its recom- 
mendations called for an annual appropriation by the Government 
of $3,000,000 a year for a period of 10 years. This represents a con- 
siderable sum for a country whose educational system comprises an 
enrollment of 1,333,971 pupils and a teaching force of 40,496. 
The States of Central and South America are actively engaged in 
extending the advantages of primary education to all their inhabit- 
ants; they have long enjoyed the advantages of secondary and higher 
education and technical training. 
. In England the school enrollment for 1914 was 5,618,030, practi- 
cally the same as last year. England and Scotland have both made 
notable progress recently in the development of welfare activities— 
medical inspection, open-air schools, and school clinics. 
In France recent efferts for development have been marked in the 
field of continuation schooling. In Sweden a thorough investigation 
of elementary instruction has resulted in reorganization at a number 
of points; and Denmark has continued the rural education develop- 
ment which has been such a striking lesson to the rest of the world. 
For completeness of the school provision Germany remains con- 
spicuous. The elementary and middle schools, corresponding roughly 
to the elementary and secondary schools of the United States, en- 
rolled about 11,000,000 pupils, or a little over 16 per cent of the pop- 
ulation. There were 26,621 continuation schools in the German 
Empire in 1912, with an attendance of 1,342,825 pupils. 
Education in Austria-Hungary is complicated by an intricate 
political and racial situation. Illiteracy is high in parts of the dual 
kingdom, and recent efforts have had to do with reducing it. For 
73226°—Ep 1914—von 1——2  
-P-A-G-E-56

the last year reported, however, the school enrollment was nearly 
16 per cent of the total population and 92 per cent of the population 
between 6 and 14 years of age. 
In Spain Government support has of late gradually been secured 
for reforms in the organization and control of primary schools. An 
important part of the new policies of the nation is larger control of 
primary education by the State. 
Italy is similarly struggling with the primary education problem. 
The national appropriation for education in 1912-13 was double that 
for 1911. There was a direct effort to eliminate illiteracy by trans- 
ferring the control of primary schools to the provincial authorities 
in certain cases. 
Russia presents a stupendous educational problem. With her 
hundred and seventy millions of people, scattered unevenly over two 
continents; with a population composite of many races, the Slav 
forming but one-half; and with religious conditions that have made 
for diversity in educational ideals, the establishment of a system of 
public education in Russia presents difficulties surpassing those of 
any other great nation. The six million pupils reported in school 
comprise but 84 per cent of the total population, as compared with 
14 to 18 per cent in most civilized nations. The Government’s appro- 
priation for 1912, the last year reported, was $68,000,000, which was 
an increase of $12,000,000 over the previous year. 
In the far East Japan is conspicuous for her development of ‘a 
modern system of education. There were 7,809,140 pupils in schools 
of all kinds for 1912 (the last year reported), as compared with 
6,627,110 in 1908-9. The expenditures for education totaled $45,- 
000,000. For China it may be said that in behalf of its 300,000,000 
people the present Republic is carrying out the educational system 
as reorganized in 1905, laying main stress on elementary schools 
and training for teachers. 
Another 225,000,000 of people are affected by the attempt to 
establish a system of modern education in India. Large grants have 
recently been made from imperial revenues to assist the several 
Provinces in developing their systems of education. 
Australia and New Zealand have been making careful investiga- 
tions preliminary to changes and improvements in their educational 
system. New South Wales is experimenting with a type of evening 
vocational schools having a two years’ course. Every State in 
Australia has provided for medical inspection and supervision of 
children attending public schools. With an enrollment in public 
schools during 1913 equivalent to 16.3 per cent of her population, and 
an average attendance of 89.2 per cent, New Zealand continues to main- 
tain the high standards and progressive spirit that have long char- 
acterized the educational work of that colony.

CHAPTER, II. 
RECENT PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRA- 
: TION. 
By Grorer Drayton Strayer, 
Professor of Educational Administration, Teachers College, Columbia University. 
ContTENTS.—Extension of the scope of public instruction—A daptation of schools to the varying capacities 
and needs of the school population—Centralization of control, or the development of the larger unit of 
administration—The scientific attack upon administrative problems—Development of the professional 
administrative officer or of the profession of school administration. 
It is possible to discuss recent progress in educational administra- 
tion either by describing individual examples of changes in city, 
county, and State administration, or by discussing critically what 
appear to be large movements or issues. The second method is 
followed in the present chapter. Whatever may be lost by omission 
of detailed description of experiments will be more than offset by 
bringing into bold relief problems that are of general significance 
and principles that may be expected to find their application in a 
great variety of practices. Recent progress in educational adminis- 
tration, as well as the more significant problems for future thought 
and experimentation, may be considered under the following heads: 
(1) The extension of the scope of public education; (2) the adapta- 
tion of schools to the varying capacities and needs of the school 
population; (3) the centralization of control, or the development of 
the larger unit of administration; (4) the scientific attack upon 
administrative problems; and (5) the development of the professional 
administrative officer or of the profession of school administration. 
EXTENSION OF THE SCOPE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. 
A generation ago free education in most communities consisted 
of an elementary school course in which children were taught the 
three R’s, together with a modicum of history and geography. Public 
high schools had, of course, begun to develop, but attendance in these 
schools was small, and the majority of communities made no such 
provision for public education. More recently the public high school 
has come to be recognized as a necessary part of the system of public 
education. The rapid increase in the number of high schools, and in 
the number of pupils who attend them, leads one to conclude that it 
will be only a very short time before high-school facilities are offered 
19 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
to all of the children of our country. It is in the light of this phenom- 
enal growth of secondary schools in the United States that one is led 
to ask whether those other and newer types of educational activity, 
more recently introduced and as yet not widespread, may be expected 
to be universally accepted and incorporated in our public-school sys- 
tems. Are we, in other words, ready to provide in our system of free 
public schools an opportunity for education to all boys and girls and 
to all men and women who are willing to avail themselves of such 
provision ? 
There is evidence in the experiments now under way throughout 
the United States that the school population is eventually to be 
measured only by the whole population. At least one may feel 
justified in suggesting that the extension of the scope of public educa- 
tion to include at the one end of the system kindergartens, and pos- 
sibly even day nurseries—while at the other extreme are provided 
senior high schools or junior colleges, summer schools, continuation 
schools for boys and girls who must go to work, night schools for 
youth and adults, vocational schools and social centers—points in the 
direction of a school system that will offer education to everyone who 
is willing to accept it. A discussion of the advantages to individual 
children or adults that accrue from this enlargement of the scope of 
public education may possibly be considered to better advantage 
in the discussion of the adaptation of schools to the varying capacities 
and needs of the school population. 
The scope of public education has been enlarged not simply in 
terms of a greater variety of opportunity afforded by schools organ- 
ized for different groups in the population, but also by reason of the 
fact that education has come to be thought of as having to do with 
the physical welfare, with the moral and social training, and with 
preparation for vocation, as well as with intellectual growth or devel- 
ments. Responsibilities once centered in the home, the church, or 
the community activity outside of schools, are now turned over to 
and accepted by the school. It has been but a step from the inaugu- 
ration of medical inspection to provision for medical and dental 
treatment in connection with public education. The older type of 
school building and equipment was frequently charged with a respon- 
sibility for many of the ills developing in childhood. Our modern 
school plants seek to provide opportunities for play and for correct 
physical exercises through the gymnasium and through supervised 
play on the school grounds. The feeding of school children who are 
hungry, provision for proper clothing, and even pensions for families 
who are compelled to send their children to school rather than enjoy 
an income from their labor, are coming to be accepted as corollaries 
of compulsory education and of our belief in the necessity for physical 
education.  
-P-A-G-E-59
  PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. 21 
The moral training of children was formerly provided for by the 
home and the church. In many communities to-day the school has 
had to accept an ever-increasing responsibility for the moral develop- 
ment of children. Indeed, one of the problems uppermost in the 
minds of those who are most thoughtful with respect to our modern 
social life is the problem of providing adequate moral training in 
connection with public education. Experiments have been con- 
ducted by offering special courses in morals and in civics; schools have 
organized children to participate in their own government and con- 
trol, and in some few cases religious bodies have offered instruction in 
religion during the regular school hours. It is impossible at this 
time to predict the development in the field of moral education, but 
probably it is safe to say that such training will eventually be pro- 
vided as a regular part of the work of our public-school system. 
The moral social training of those who have passed beyond the 
period of regular school attendance is receiving some consideration 
in our public schools. The establishment of civic and social centers 
which have involved the discussion of community problems, as well 
as a better use of leisure time, promises much for the moral develop- 
ment of youth and adults. It is not strange that we have come to 
realize that in our country, with its constant stream of immigration, 
the problem of education, whether intellectual, physical, or moral, is 
quite as much the problem of education of adults as it is the problem 
of training children. 
Through the establishment of continuation schools, with sessions 
held both at night and during the daylight hours, the public educa- 
tion service had been greatly enlarged. Especially by the establish- 
ment of vocational and prevocational schools has the number of 
those who may profit by public education beyond the compulsory 
school age been increased. Along with this provision for education 
beyond the elementary school field, there is developing an increased 
requirement of school attendance, which may be expected in the near 
future to raise the age of compulsory school attendance to 16 or even 
higher. 
The extension of the scope of public education to the whole popu- 
lation, and the development of the greater variety of activity upon 
the part of schools dealing with different groups, lead one to ask 
whither we are tending. There are those who believe that the effi- 
ciency of our public-school system as an agency for promoting social 
solidarity and social progress will be, and even has already been, 
interfered with by adding so greatly to the school’s responsibility. 
When we face the issue, however, with respect to any group who 
need education, the answer seems inevitably to be that the school 
should provide for them. Our school plants were formerly in use 
during a very small fraction of the time. We have discovered that 
     
-P-A-G-E-60
  22 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
it is possible so to furnish them that they may be made available 
during three times as many hours as formerly. Our communities 
can not afford to invest in buildings and equipment for social and 
recreational purposes while our school plants lie idle. 
In like manner, when we ask concerning the greater variety of . 
educational activity engaged in by our modern schools, efficiency in 
administration demands that the several types of education—physical, 
intellectual, moral, and vocational—be undertaken by a single insti- 
tution. It would be unfortunate were we to develop a dual system 
of education—one to correspond with past educational development, 
a system of schools preparing people for college in order that they 
might enter the professions, and another organized for those whose 
vocational training must follow immediately the fundamental training 
given in the elementary school. The children, youth, or adults in . 
our school system furnish the only satisfactory unit of administration. 
Children who are in school must be examined by physicians and 
dentists, and given such treatment as is necessary. To divide the 
responsibility for these children by giving the schools charge of 
their intellectual growth and the board of health charge of their 
physical welfare is to suggest a duality that does not exist and to 
open the way for interference and maladjustment in administration, 
We have accepted in this country an ideal of public education 
broad enough to include physical education, moral education, intel- 
lectual education, and vocational education. These several types 
of training are to be made available for all of our people. We may 
confidently expect, along with the development of greater variety 
of opportunity for little children and youth, an ever-increasing 
provision for those who have recently left school to engage in gainful 
employment, as well as for those adults in the community who may 
seek special training, or who may meet profitably for the discussion 
and solution of community problems. Public education is already 
our greatest single social enterprise. We may expect that it will 
increase in scope and in significance, even though we may not cer- 
tainly predict all of the lines along which this development is to come. 
ADAPTATION OF SCHOOLS TO THE VARYING CAPACITIES AND NEEDS 
OF THE SCHOOL POPULATION. 
One of the chief problems in administration has always been to 
make provision for those who vary from the type. Strangely enough, 
we have in the past been concerned mainly with making a provision 
that would enable children to move forward in the system a little 
more slowly or to attempt to master a little less of a common type of 
education. The equality offered by the school system has, for the 
most part, been an equal opportunity to take the kind of an ele- 
mentary school course that led to a high-school course, which in turn
-P-A-G-E-61
  PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION, 23 
prepared for college and for later professional activity. In recent 
years our studies in retardation and elimination have led us to con- 
sider more carefully than heretofore the problem of adjustment in 
terms of different types of education, rather than with respect to 
the time involved in completing a uniform course. There is, of 
course, a significant adjustment to ability made when group teaching 
or individual instruction or flexible grading has made possible 
greater success by individual children. We are facing to-day, 
however, a much more intricate problem, and all over the country 
we are experimenting in our elementary schools with classes in which 
the education given is specialized to meet the demands of varying 
groups of children. 
We no longer think of our work as satisfactory for defective chil- 
dren when we provide for a very slow rate of progress and a minimum 
of accomplishment. Rather, we have come to accept the fact that 
these children need most of all a kind of training which will render 
them productive members of society. We are providing as well 
against a possible danger to the larger social group by arranging for 
custodial care, or for the sterilization of the mentally defective. In 
most of our larger cities some provision for slow and for defective 
children has already been instituted. In some of the States the 
problem has been attacked. In New Jersey, for example, a State 
law requires that provision be made for- children who are three or 
more years behind the grade for their age. 
In many school systems classes have been organized for those who 
are anemic or tubercular. These open-air or open-window classes 
involve a régime which plans definitely not simply to correct an 
unfortunate adjustment in the ordinary class, but also to provide 
for definite physical growth and development for a group of children 
who are particularly in need of special treatment. Stress is laid in 
this case upon the physical aspect of education. A different type 
of special adjustment is found in the schools for the deaf and for the 
crippled. For these children differences in method, in equipment, 
and in courses of study provide opportunities that may be signifi- 
cant to them while in school and give them a kind of training that 
will make them self-supporting in later life. A special adjustment 
with respect to moral social training is provided in day truant schools 
and in parental schools. We are no longer satisfied with a scheme 
of administration which removes from the school system the truant 
or incorrigible child. We are concerned, rather, with providing such 
education as will bring the child back into the school system better 
educated with respect to the field of his particular deficiency. 
These attempts to adjust our school systems to the varying capaci- 
ties and needs of children are relatively more simple for the larger 
cities than for smaller communities or for more sparsely settled parts
-P-A-G-E-62
    24. EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
of our country. In the small city the problem of adjusting the 
school system to the varying groups of children has not infrequently 
been solved by organizing an ungraded class in which individual 
instruction is given. In a single group of 10 or 12 children there 
may be found those who are backward or mentally defective, those 
who need special treatment on account of physical defect, together 
with a boy or girl who may need special disciplinary treatment. For 
the rural school situation State institutions have in some measure 
taken care of particularly aggravated cases. With the development 
of the county as a unit for the administration of public education 
we may expect special schools, either day or boarding, to be pro- 
vided for special groups of children. The problem of transportation 
to county day schools is somewhat more difficult to meet than 
the corresponding problem in cities. It is well, however, to note 
the fact that our city school systems have had to face the problem 
of transportation and of custodial care for children in order to pro- 
vide these special opportunities. 
Throughout the United States more care has been taken to provide 
special classes for the defective or delinquent than for especially 
capable children. A few experiments have been made which go to 
show that bright children can, when the opportunity is offered, not 
only save time but also do more significient work when special pro- 
vision is made for them. Experiments in Baltimore, Indianapolis, 
and Worcester seem to confirm this statement. Many children of 
more than usual ability become inefficient by virtue of the fact that 
they are placed in classes with children of much less intellectual 
capacity. Any adequate adjustment of our school system to the 
varying capacities of children, or any claim to equality of opportu- 
nity, can be justified only when children of unusual capacity are 
segregated, especially beyond 12 or 13 years of age. 
One of the most significant outcomes of the present movement 
for junior high schools may be found in the possible adjustment 
which can be made in this type of institution to the several groups 
of children who complete the first six grades of the elementary school 
course. A junior high school which offers the traditional course in 
preparation for later high-school work and for college might very 
properly segregate the capable children who desire to undertake this 
kind of work. In any such school provision for those who are to 
enter the commercial field can very properly place emphasis upon 
studies that have direct application in this field. Indeed, in the 
latter part of such a three-year course considerable skill in bookkeep- 
ing, penmanship, rapid calculations, stenography, and typewriting 
may be required. For another group of pupils the prevocational 
training in the industrial or household arts will take account of natural
-P-A-G-E-63
  PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. 25 
aptitude and ability, as well as possible future vocation. It is not 
necessary to assume in such a course that a boy or girl will remain 
interested in the field first chosen, or that he is placed for life by choos- 
ing any one course that may be offered. It should be possible to 
shift from one course to the other, and with the three-year senior 
high school following the first period of three years it should be 
easily possible for any pupil showing unusual ability to take the 
more extended training which will lead to college, or to positions of 
greater responsibility, by virtue of a larger outlook and more sig- 
nificant technical training, in the fields of commerce and industry. 
In rural high schools, and in some city schools, one of the options 
both for the junior and senior high-school course will be in the field 
of agriculture. It would be unfortunate, however, to confine the 
rural high school to agriculture, just as it would be to confine the 
city high school to the demand for such labor as might be found in 
the immediate vicinity of the high-school plant. A primary function 
of secondary education is the discovery of particular capacity or 
ability, and it has never been seriously argued that these capacities 
or abilities upon the part of children are directly related to the envi- 
ronment into which they chance to be born. 
Along with the development of the newer type of high school, ex- 
cellent examples of which may be found in Los Angeles and Grand 
Rapids and in the secondary vocational agricultural schools of Mas- 
sachusetts, there have grown up in many places special types of 
schools that are called prevocational and vocational schools, continu- 
ation schools, and trade schools. All of these schools belong in a very 
significant way to the secondary school group, since they assume as 
a foundation a. definite preliminary fundamental training such as is 
ordinarily provided in the first six years of our elementary school 
course. Prevocational schools, which look toward preparation for 
work in the industries, have been established in many of our cities. 
The best examples are probably to be found in Massachusetts, New 
York, and New Jersey, although individual schools of excellence may 
be found in many communities in other States. Continuation schools 
have been established in many communities, and have been known 
over a long period of years as night schools. These schools have, for 
the most part, been concerned with a type of training comparable to 
the regular elementary or high-school course. More recently con- 
tinuation schools have undertaken prevocational training, or a kind 
of vocational training which supplements the work done in the in- 
dustries. Provision has been made in a number of communities for 
day work in these schools. One of the first examples was the continua- 
tion schools of Cincinnati, in which the employers not only allowed 
the pupils to be absent from the shops, but also paid for the time taken 
up byschool work. We may confidently expect an increase in the pro- 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  26 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
vision made for this type of work. We are beginning to realize that 
the responsibility for educating a boy or girl does not end with the 
compulsory education period or with the entering upon gainful em- 
ployment. Indeed, coincidentally with the decay of the apprentice- 
ship system in the United States has come the realization of a large 
and ever-increasing responsibility for making provision for supple- 
mentary training, both general and vocational, for those who go to 
work before they have reached maturity. 
Public school systems, in order to offer that quality of opportunity 
which is promised by our democracy, must continue to differentiate 
schools and classes in terms of the varying interests and capacities of 
children. At the same time the needs of the school population, which 
are in the final analysis the needs of the whole population, must 
bring about another type of differentiation that will take account of 
the many fields of endeavor in which people are engaged, or for which 
they are to be prepared. We may confidently expect that our school 
systems will become more complex as they succeed in providing ade- 
quate educational opportunity for all of the people. 
CENTRALIZATION OF CONTROL, OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LARGER 
UNIT OF ADMINISTRATION. 
Many of the reforms which have been undertaken by way of en- 
larging the scope of public education, and in the direction of equaliz- 
ing opportunity, have been confined to large city school systems. 
Progress in these directions, especially for the smaller urban communi- 
ties and for the rural population, must depend upon the development 
of more highly centralized State systems of control and upon the in- 
crease in the size of the administrative unit. : 
It is the peculiar function of the State, as opposed to the local com- 
munity, to provide for an equalization of opportunity through the 
organization of an equitable system of taxation, the significant dis- 
tribution of school moneys, and the inspection and supervision of 
schools. Adequate control upon the part of the State can be brought 
about only through the development of a State educational office 
which has been freed from politics and which has been given sufficient 
financial support. In recent years several of the States have created 
State boards of education, whose duty it has been to discover the 
most able administrative officer available for the post of commissioner 
of education. In many cases the law has provided for deputy or as- 
sistant commissioners, chosen upon a like basis. Laws of this sort 
have been passed during the past few years in Massachusetts, New 
Jersey, Idaho, Pennsylvania, Nevada, California, and South Dakota. 
In the two States in which this form of organization has been in opera- 
tion longest the results already achieved seem to justify the change 
that was made. State boards, consisting of members appointed by 
the governor instead of persons who serve by virtue of some other
-P-A-G-E-65
PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION, 27 
office which they hold, can be expected to render significant public 
service in choosing, without political consideration, the executive 
officers for the State education department, while at the same time 
they represent as a legislative body the people of the whole State for 
the determination of educational policy. 
When the State education department is organized under the di- 
rection of professional specialists we may expect to develop a type of 
control and supervision which will equalize opportunities throughout 
the State. In most of the States to-day there is need of a revision of 
the basis upon which State moneys are paid to local communities, 
both for the sake of enforcing State control with respect to compul- 
sory education, proper buildings and equipment, adequate training 
for teachers, and the like, as well as for the encouragement of newer 
types of education, and for the equalization of the burden — the 
community bears in the support of schools. 
The type of control exercised by the State need not sistent 
result in a stifling uniformity of organization, curriculum, or methods 
of teaching. Under the direction of the specialists who are found in 
the State department one might hold that schemes for organization, 
for curricula, or for methods of instruction, as provided by the State 
department, be followed unless the local community had an experi- 
ment or variation from the State requirement which they submitted 
for criticism and approval. Any wise executive would seek to en- 
courage variation and experiment, especially when it is realized that 
there are in every State many communities that are, and would con- 
tinue to be, in advance of anything which might be required of all 
communities by the State department. The requirements of the State 
department would, of necessity, be expressed in terms of minima, 
rather than in terms of maxima. 
The case of the courses of study will serve to illustrate the point of 
view expressed above. In many communities there is little or no 
attempt to provide any adequate organization of subject matter or 
significant suggestion with respect to methods of teaching. In these 
communities, the tenure of teachers is extremely short. Our States 
have provided manuals or State courses of study which have done 
much to increase the efficiency of these schools. There is need, how- 
ever, in many States for a more significant and probably more elabo- 
rate presentation of this material for the sake of teachers who are 
inexperienced or poorly trained. This need is not confined to the 
elementary school. In the high schools young men and young 
women are attempting to teach with little professional training. A 
document like that recently issued by the commissioner of education. 
of New Jersey, on the teaching of plane and solid geometry, would be 
of very great assistance to most beginning teachers of these subjects 
jn American high schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  28 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The necessity for State control has been most apparent in the 
attempt to establish State-wide vocational education. In this field 
there has been need for special assistance to those communities 
which were willing to undertake this newer type of public education. 
Much of the success that has been achieved in the organization of 
these schools has come about through the inspection and supervision 
given by the State departments concerned, rather than through the 
appropriation of State money which has been enjoyed by the local 
community. It may be said in passing that control by the State of 
local educational activity can always be made most effective through 
the granting or withholding of State funds. 
Many examples of the growing tendency to centralize control in 
the State office might be cited. The certification of teachers is being 
taken out of the hands of local authorities, not necessarily in order 
that the requirement for entering the teaching profession be made 
uniform, but rather in order to make sure of a minimum qualification 
for those who are to teach. Textbooks are being chosen for the 
whole State by textbook commissions or others empowered by the 
State with this authority, in the hope that better books will be made 
available for children, and that the buying of books by parents will 
prove less burdensome than has been the case under the varying 
systems of local adoption. State-wide medical inspection has been 
provided for in recent legislation, and will in all probability be carried 
out in the more backward communities much sooner than would 
have been the case had local initiative been depended upon. Pro- 
visions for pensions and for minimum salaries for teachers have in 
many cases increased the efficiency of local schools by providing for 
a higher grade of teacher. 
Whatever control may be vested in the State board of education 
and its executive officers must be supplemented by the local adminis- 
trative authority. Most American cities enjoy the right to control 
in considerable measure public education through the organization 
of local boards of education. If we omit the larger cities the units 
of control in New England have been the town, and in other parts 
of the country the county, township, and district. The town system 
has been modified to some extent in New England through the con- 
solidation of towns for supervisory and administrative purposes. In 
the South, the county unit has offered an opportunity for improve- 
ment in administration that has not always been utilized. In most 
parts of the United States to-day, outside of New England, any 
significant improvement for village and rural schools seems to depend 
upon increasing the size of the administrative unit. Our present 
political organization, together with the experience of some of the 
States in which the county unit has been utilized to advantage 
during the past few years, points unmistakably to the advantage
-P-A-G-E-67
PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. 29 
to be gained by utilizing this unit of administration. Outside of 
certain Southern States—Maryland, Kentucky, North Carolina, 
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Tennessee—two States, 
Utah, with seven counties organized into a single school. district, 
and Ohio, with recent legislation with respect to county organization, 
are already experimenting in this field. In many other States, State 
teachers’ associations, State departments of education, and other 
agencies are advocating the county unit of administration as the only 
-possible solution of the rural school problem. 
When the county unit has been established, with a county board 
of education elected at large, whose duty it is to secure a professionally 
trained executive officer, who will in turn appoint, subject to the 
confirmation of the county board, assistant executive and supervisory 
officers who will be charged with special responsibilities, the problems 
of the village and rural school may be expected to receive more 
careful study and more satisfactory solution. What is needed in 
most counties is not a supervisory or administrative officer for each 
township or o’her division, but rather a central organization with a 
corps of specialists, whose duty it is to deal with the several aspects 
of the school situation. In one representative county there is a 
superintendent of schools, a supervisor charged with special responsi- 
bility for the work of the upper grades, a primary supervisor—each 
of these supervisors having an assistant; a supervisor of industrial 
arts, with assistants; a supervisor of household arts, with assistants; 
and two supervisors of one-room rural schools. With such an 
organization it has been possible to bring about an ever increasing 
efficiency for all of the schools of the county. With a smaller ad- 
ministrative or supervisory unit, employing but one executive or 
administrative officer, many of the problems of these schools would 
have had to be neglected, or would have received less adequate 
treatment at the hands of the one who had to solve all of the problems. 
The tendency to centralize control in public education in State 
offices, under the direction of State boards of education, and with the 
immediate control of professional executives and supervisors, is one 
of the most significant measures of progress in modern school ad- 
ministration. Progress in educational administration depends in no 
small measure in freeing our schools from political control. A lay 
State board of education, with no axes to grind, may be expected to 
choose able men as State commissioners. County boards of edu- 
cation, with the resources of a county rather than of a township or 
district behind them, may be expected to choose a professional 
specialist for the position of county superintendent of schools and 
to support him in the development of an adequate county school 
system.

THE SCIENTIFIC ATTACK UPON ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS. 
From time immemorial administrative officers have presented, in 
reports to the public, data with respect to public education in support 
of administrative procedure and for the sake of securing support for 
new measures of efficiency. In recent years the data so presented 
have become increasingly significant by virtue of a growing profes- 
sional interest and the development of a scientific attack upon the 
problems of administration. It is not uncommon to find in a school 
report to-day a table of attendance so distributed as to depict not 
a mere statement of average but the whole situation, including a 
measure of that which is most common, the extremes, and the varia- 
bility. Age-grade tables and data which make clear the progress of 
children through the public-school system are to be found in the better 
school reports. Agitation for a permanent continuing census as the 
basis for the enforcement of compulsory education is reinforced by 
the organization of this service in some of the larger cities, notably 
New York, Philadelphia, and Rochester. Cumulative records, which 
make it possible to trace the history of children during their whole 
school life with respect to attendance, scholarship, health, and 
progress, have been recommended by the Department of Superin- 
tendence of the National Education Association and by the United 
States Bureau of Education and are already in use in hundreds of 
school systems. Scales or tests for the measurement of the achieve- 
ments of pupils have been derived and are applied in most of our 
more progressive school systems. Records of such measurements 
have been made available through reports which enable school systems 
to make more adequate comparisons among themselves than were 
formerly possible. School accounting has, in some instances, been so 
improved as to indicate with definiteness the purposes for which all 
money is spent in terms of the particular service secured, and also 
with respect to the particular division, school, or subject taught. A 
system of accounting has been suggested by the committee of the 
Department of Superintendence of the National Education Associa- 
tion, in cooperation with the National Association of School Account- 
ing Officers, the Bureau of Education, and the Bureau of the Census, 
which will make possible a complete analysis of school costs. 
Not least significant in this movement for the development of a 
scientific attack upon administrative problems is the work which has 
been done in the organization and conduct of State and municipal 
school surveys. From the standpoint of administrative practice, a 
school survey may be defined as an inquiry concerning public education 
which seeks to evaluate the work of all of those educational agencies 
supported in whole or in part by public moneys with respect to their 
organization, administration, supervision, cost, physical equipment,
-P-A-G-E-69
PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. 31 
courses of study, teaching staff, methods of teaching, student body, 
and results as measured by the achievements of those who are being 
trained or who have been trained therein. The demand for effi- 
ciency on the part of all public servants and the growing belief in 
the possibility of evaluating the work of our schools will doubtless 
operate to bring about many more surveys within the next few years. 
Those who have made school surveys have sought to apply scientific 
methods in the conduct of these inquiries. It will be well to review 
carefully the principles which should control and the methods which 
have been employed in this field. 
The attempt to evaluate current practice and to increase the effi- 
ciency of schools has always been a function of the administrative 
and supervisory corps of our school systems. School surveys are to be 
thought of as supplementary to the regular work of the supervisory 
staff. As our school systems develop bureaus of investigation and 
research, such as have already been established in New York, Chicago, 
Boston, Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Kansas City, Oakland, and 
elsewhere, there will be less need for the survey as we now know it. 
In all communities, however, there will be occasions when expert 
knowledge will be desired and when specialists outside of the regular 
supervisory staff will be called in. The lay public and the educational 
profession will come to recognize that the calling in of specialists for 
the purpose of consultation is not a reflection upon the efficiency of 
the superintendent, the board of education, or the members of the 
teaching staff, but rather a recognition of the complexity of the edu- 
cational problem and of the development of specialists in the profes- 
sion of educational administration. 
Surveys, if they are to serve any useful purpose in education, must 
be constructive. We judge the work of a supervisor by the growth 
and development of those who are supervised. In like manner the 
survey, as a supplementary agency, is to be judged not in terms of the 
weaknesses or deficiencies which it discovers, but rather by means of 
the suggestions for development and improvement which are con- 
tained in it. It is necessary, of course, to discover wherein a school 
system is weak before any adequate remedies can be suggested, but 
the survey which is concerned mainly with a statement of deficiencies 
can not accomplish much in the way of improving the work of teachers 
or administrative officers, and will probably result in destroying that 
public confidence which is so essential for the development of a strong 
school system. This constructive aspect of the work of the survey 
may be expressed by saying that it is the primary business of the 
survey staff to teach. 
The improvement or development of a system of public education 
involves the education of the community, as well as the teaching of   
1 See also p. 39 of this report. 
   
-P-A-G-E-70
    32 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
teachers or the consultation with supervisory or administrative offi- 
cers. A survey should seek to secure a large measure of public sup- 
port for the constructive program proposed. To this end, members 
of the survey staff should meet with groups of interested citizens for 
the sake of discussing educational problems and for the presentation 
of the program for development which has resulted from the inquiry. 
A survey can never legitimately seek either to discredit or to 
accredit any individual member of the supervisory or teaching staff 
or other employee of the board of education. The responsibility for 
securing adequate administration and supervision rests with the 
board of education. The nomination of assistants to the superin- 
tendents or supervisory officers, of principals, and of teachers, and 
their placing in the school system, should be in the hands of the super- 
intendent of schools, subject to confirmation by the board of education. 
In like manner, individual inefficiency upon the part of assistants to 
the superintendents or members of the teaching corps should be dis- 
covered as a regular part of the supervisory or administrative activity 
vested by the board in the superintendent of schools. It isnot proba- 
ble that any survey commission could become well enough acquainted 
with the work of individuals either legitimately to praise or to blame. 
It is certainly not desirable that they should be expected to pass upon 
the qualifications of employees of the school board. A school survey 
should be conducted upon an impersonal basis. 
In the foregoing paragraphs there have been presented those prin- 
ciples which are fundamental in the conduct of school surveys. 
There remain to be discussed the methods to be employed in the 
attempt to measure or to evaluate the work of the school system. 
The writer is able to distinguish three methods that have been em- 
ployed, each of which seems to have its place in the work of the survey. 
These methods or means may be named as follows: (1) The con- 
sensus of opinion or of judgments of specialists; (2) the comparison 
of the school system surveyed with other school systems; (3) the 
measurement of efficiency by means of scales or units of measurement. 
The judgments of specialists—In education, as in other forms of 
human activity, there will always be a place for the judgment of 
any one who is recognized in his particular calling or profession as 
a specialist with respect to the practice involved. If a group of 
such specialists, after careful observation and study, agree in their 
diagnosis of the situation and with respect to the remedy to be 
invoked, we are usually willing to act in accordance with their judg- 
ment. It is important to emphasize the fact that a consensus of 
judgment is what is taken, rather than an agreement which has 
resulted from the judgment of one who has secured the approval of 
others. It is easily possible to find a dominating personality whose 
judgment may be poor, but who may nevertheless impose it upon
-P-A-G-E-71
  PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. 33 
others. The members of a survey commission, in so far as they 
attempt to evaluate the work of a school system on the basis of their 
individual opinions or judgments, should be careful to record these 
judgments individually and to value most highly those judgments 
which they have in common. The survey should not be a series of 
monographs prepared by specialists, but rather the report of a board 
or committee who have been able to agree in the recommendations 
which they make. 
The record of opinion which the specialists make should be put 
in such terms as can be easily understood by teachers. The judg- 
ment of a philosopher may be sound and yet couched in such language 
as to be unintelligible to the rank and file of the teaching profession. 
Keeping in mind the teaching function of the survey, the specialist 
should seek to express his judgment in terms which apply to the 
every-day practice of the classroom. For example, it is essential 
that any criticism of the quality of teaching should be expressed in 
terms of those criteria which apply to the different types of teaching. 
There are doubtless general criteria or aims of education which can 
be interpreted by the philosopher in such a way as to be applicable 
to many different types of classroom procedure. The survey may 
not assume this power of interpretation upon the part of the teach- 
ing corps, but would rather embody such criticism and suggestions 
as may seem necessary in terms of criteria applicable to the drill 
lesson, lessons involving thinking, lessons for appreciation, study 
lessons, and social and disciplinary phases of school work. 
Comparison of the school system.—A comparison which may be 
instituted among several school systems with respect to their organi- 
zation, curricula, methods of teaching, costs, and the like is a legiti- 
mate part of a school survey. Our common practice is the result of 
the best judgment of many men working in many situations over a 
long period of years. That which is less efficient tends to be elimi- 
nated, and that which is most worth while to persist by the process 
of trial and success. A school system which shows great variation 
from common practice with respect to its curricula or time allotment 
for studies or costs should be most carefully scrutinized with respect 
to the functions which show this variability. Conformity to the 
common practice may not be absolute proof of efficiency, but it at 
least suggests the exercise of judgment in conformity with that of 
others who have attacked the same problems. 
Measurement of efficiency Much is to be gained by applying 
units or scales of measurement which will enable us to make more 
accurate comparisons than have been commonly instituted hereto- 
fore. By applying scales in handwriting, in English composition, 
or carefully derived tests in arithmetic, spelling, or reading, it is 
73226°—xp 1914—vor 1——3.  
-P-A-G-E-72
  34 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
possible to compare the achievements of pupils among several school 
systems and within the several units of a single system. These 
results will often show satisfactory work for the school system, or 
for some unit or units within it, and will, on the other hand, some- 
times discover a remarkable lack of achievement. The more fre- 
quently such measurements of achievements are undertaken, the 
more valid will be the comparison which can be instituted and the 
more nearly we may hope to arrive at a statement of astandard. It 
is not only with respect to the work done in school studies, however, 
that such units of measurement are available. The efficiency of the 
enforcement of compulsory education can in some degree be meas- 
ured by the time elasping between the beginning of the period of 
truancy and the period at which the pupil is returned to school. 
The adaptation of schools to the individual differences of pupils is 
indicated by a careful study of retardation, acceleration, and elimi- 
nation. One might judge of the efficiency of medical inspection in 
terms of the better physical condition of pupils. The costs of various 
parts or units of the school system can be determined if an adequate 
system of bookkeeping has been established. 
In all the work of the survey it is necessary to observe, to measure 
in so far as possible, and to report upon the condition of the com- 
munity’s political, industrial, social, and educational life that favors 
or interferes with the work of the schools. Indeed it is not possible 
to suggest a program for the development of a school system without 
a thorough-going appreciation of the community’s present status 
and of its needs. The contact of a survey commission with groups 
of interested citizens, as was suggested in an earlier part of the dis- 
cussion, may serve in considerable measure to furnish this social 
background, but wherever possible a more painstaking and precise 
study of conditions should be undertaken. 
Surveys which are understood by the teaching profession and by 
the lay public as supplementary to the regular activity of the super- 
visory and administrative corps; which undertake to teach through 
appreciation of that which is worthy; which seek to capitalize the 
successes of the school system; which involve the discovery of weak- 
nesses only for the sake of suggesting a program for growth and 
development; which are conducted upon an impersonal basis; 
which endeavor to help and to stimulate rather than to find fault and 
to destroy—from such school surveys we may expect to derive much 
which will make for the greater efficiency of our public schools. 
The development of the school survey as a supplement to the reg- 
ular work of the supervisory and administrative staff of the school 
system suggests the possibility of developing in our schools a system 
of inspection which will take the place of our present practice of 
placing responsibility for successful work upon local administrative
-P-A-G-E-73
  PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. 85 
officers and teachers. If such were the result, it would be most 
unfortunate. It is rather to be hoped that the methods of those 
who undertake school surveys may become, in so far as they are 
valid, the methods of the local administrative officers and of the 
local teaching corps. One of the elements in our present situation 
that seems especially worthy is this feeling of responsibility for suc- 
cessful work which is found as a part of the professional consciousness 
of most teachers. To substitute for this responsibility an attitude 
of subservience to an inspecting authority, and an attempt to cram 
children to get them past examinations, would be most unfortunate. 
State and county administrative officers will do their most significant 
work in the training of teachers to a higher degree of efficiency 
through careful supervision, rather than through a system of inspec- 
tion which seeks to secure a uniform product. 
The development of a scientific attack upon the problems of 
administration may be expected to make rapid progress during the 
next few years. Through the data accumulated in the reports of 
superintendents, through the work of special departments of research 
and investigation in our larger city school systems, by means of the 
collection of significant data by State officers, by means of systematic 
inquiries or surveys of educational activities in State, county, and 
city, and through the study of education in our professional schools, 
we may hope to measure more significantly than heretofore our edu- 
cational practice and to establish with greater certainty the principles 
upon which we base administrative procedure. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROFESSIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER OR 
OF THE PROFESSION OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. 
When we seek to review recent educational progress, whether we 
are concerned with the enlarged scope and complexity of our edu- 
cational system, with the problem of adapting our schools to the 
varying capacities and needs of children, with the tendency to 
enlarge the administrative unit and to increase the responsibility of 
professional administrative officers, or with the development of a 
scientific method of attack upon administrative problems—all of 
these seem to point unmistakably in the direction of the development 
of a profession of educational administration as distinct from teach- 
ing. There was a time when a single school, organized for the sake 
of a few families in a local community, could be supervised more or 
less adequately by the local minister. With the development of 
professional knowledge with respect to the theory and practice of 
teaching, it was necessary to draft from the teaching corps one 
conversant with this field who could supervise and direct the work 
of others. In many cases, as we have developed larger school sys- 
tems, the work of the chief executive officer has consisted in no small 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
    36 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
part of attending to office routine and business management. There 
is a tendency in our modern school organization to provide for the 
business management of our schools by employing a business agent 
who works either under the direction of the superintendent or as an 
officer coordinate with him in authority. Whatever the solution of 
this problem may be, it may be asserted without fear of contradiction 
that the work of an administrative officer, whether State, county, 
or city, is of sufficient significance on the professional side to challenge 
the most able. In the development of the profession of educational 
administration we may expect to recruit our forces from among those 
who have had experience in teaching and in the supervision of 
teachers. We must expect to add to their equipment a more thor- 
oughgoing knowledge of the sciences fundamental to education— 
psychology, sociology, and biology (especially as it has reference to 
normal physical development and to hygiene), together with training 
in economics and in government. Not least significant will be the 
work in educational administration which will make available a 
scientific method of attack upon administrative problems. Such 
courses of instruction are already offered in several of our American 
universities and are being taken by large numbers of superintendents 
of schools both during a year or more which they give.up to profes- 
sional study and during the summer sessions which are held in con- 
nection with our leading universities. The position of State commis- 
sioner of education or county or city superintendent is in increasing 
measure being freed from political control. These positions offer 
one of the largest fields for public service. We may confidently 
expect the development of an increasingly efficient group of pro- 
fessional educational administrative officers.

PROGRESS OF SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN CITIES OF MORE 
THAN 25,000 POPULATION.'! 
By J. H. Van Sicx1z, 
Superintendent of City Schools, Springfield, Mass. 
Conrents,—Administration—School surveys and school supervision—Reorganization of grades—The 
intermediate school and industrial education—The vocational trend in education—Other topics 
emphasized in the annual reports. 
One year is too limited a period in the slow evolution of education 
to include any marked developments not on trial or at least under 
discussion in previous years. A review of a single year’s activities 
may, however, serve to show what changes of emphasis upon the 
varied activities of school systems are disclosed in annual and special 
reports, and thus to indicate general tendencies as well as special 
instances of an experimental nature that seem to have promise for 
the future. : 
ADMINISTRATION. 
In the field of administration the effect upon school systems of 
changes in form of city government may be noted. In some portions 
of the country, school systems are so absolutely separate from other 
city affairs that a change in the form of city government does not 
affect them. This is the case in Dayton, Ohio, and Springfield, Il., 
which have adopted the city manager plan; but in St. Paul, Minn., 
and Buffalo, N. Y., the commission plan includes the schools along 
with other departments. The commission form of government went 
into effect in St. Paul on June 1, 1914. The commissioner of educa- 
tion, who also has charge of the public library and of the municipal 
auditorium, is one of six commissioners elected at large, each of whom 
is assigned by the mayor to a particular department. 
The commissioner appoints for a term of two years a superintendent 
of schools, whose salary is fixed by the charter, a public librarian for 
two years, and a superintendent of the auditorium for two years. 
In this way the public schools, the public library, and the municipal 
auditorium are closely affiliated for harmonious educational work. 
The commissioner of education appoints the whole teaching staff, 
on recommendation by the superintendent of schools. The com- 
missioner has no power of initiative in appointing teachers, but he

  38 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
may remove for cause on his own motion or on complaint of the 
superintendent. It is the intent of the charter that all teachers and 
principals once appointed shall serve during efficiency and good 
behavior. The commissioner also appoints a superintendent of 
school buildings, who has charge of all school buildings and school 
grounds. 
The charter also provides for an advisory school board of 12 
members to be appointed by the commissioner, one from each ward 
of the city. The powers of this board are purely advisory, but the 
members may visit schools and discuss in meetings any subject 
related to the schools. The meetings are public. 
The charter also provides for an advisory board of not less than 8 
and not more than 12 teachers. This advisory board is elected by 
the teachers by secret ballot. The charter provides that this board 
shall advise with the superintendent and the commissioner of educa- 
tion on problems relating to textbooks, courses of study, and methods 
of teaching. The powers of this board, also, are purely advisory, and 
the charter explicitly declares that ‘“The adoption of such recom- 
mendations shall lie in the discretion of the superintendent of schools 
and the commissioner of education.” 
The management of schools by a single commissioner instead of 
by a school board is a radical departure in school administration. 
It is a perfectly logical feature of a commission form of city govern- 
ment, but there is as yet little or no experience by which to judge its 
permanent value. Elsewhere, even under the commission form of 
city government, the schools have been regarded as an interest so 
vitally important as to justify a commission charged solely with their 
management, this commission being the school board. In the short 
time that the St. Paul plan has been in operation it is noted that all 
professional business, such as the appointment of teachers, the 
installation of machinery for manual training, and the opening of new 
rooms or new classes, has been transacted with great expedition, 
without the delay involved in waiting for school-board action. It 
remains to be seen whether in other respects this plan has in it the 
elements that favor its survival. At the present time it must be 
regarded as an interesting experiment. 
In Buffalo, N. Y., the commission charter recently adopted pro- 
vides for (1) a superintendent of education to be appointed by the 
commission, and (2) a board of education, consisting of five members, 
also to be appointed by the commission. It is difficult to see how the 
schools can be safeguarded from political domination under such a 
charter, or how harmony can result from an arrangement whereby 
the school board and superintendent hold their positions at the will 
of the same governing body and the school board is without power to 
choose its own executive officer.

  SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 39 
SCHOOL SURVEYS AND SCHOOL SUPERVISION. 
Prior to the present school year some 20 formal school surveys 
had been made by outside examiners and the findings published, the 
first being that of Baltimore, Md., under the direction of former 
United States Commissioner of Education Dr. E. E. Brown, and the 
latest that of Portland, Oreg., under the direction of Prof. Elwood P. 
Cubberly, head of the department of education, Leland Stanford 
Junior University. The year 1914 has been less productive in this 
direction than any one of the three preceding years. Springfield, IIL, 
and South Bend, Ind., are cities in the group covered by this chapter 
that report such surveys as having been made during the current 
year.! The Springfield survey was made by the Russell Sage Founda- 
tion and the survey of South Bend by the department of education 
of the University of Chicago. 
The motives that have inspired these surveys have for the most 
part been commendable, and even those which for local reasons have 
not been immediately productive of improvement within the system 
surveyed have contributed their quota to the sum total of experience 
in this new field of educational effort. The service which the surveys 
thus far made have rendered to individual school systems, however 
great it may have been, is far surpassed by the widespread tendency 
which both indirectly and directly they have stimulated toward 
self-examination within the school system. The critically judicial 
attitude now manifested by the majority of reporting officers, which 
has replaced the attitude of self-complacency so conspicuous in 
superintendents’ reports of a former decade, is one of the most 
noticeable features of the current year. 
Not many years ago Dr. J. M. Rice, the pioneer outside investigator 
of school systems, said that experience had taught him to place no 
reliance whatever on reports published by school officials regarding 
the condition of their schools, such reports being frequently no more 
than political documents, and consequently, as a rule, entirely mis- 
leading. There is no surer indication of the great change for the 
better that has come about in school administration than the frank- 
ness with which defects are set forth in reports and the temperate 
statement of merits claimed. The supervisory officers by no means 
regard themselves as being most acceptable in their several com- 
munities when they pose as presiding over schools which have little 
to desire in the way of improvement. On the contrary, for the most 
part they regard themselves as most useful when they show them- 
selves able to see defects and to suggest remedies—a remarkable 
change, indeed, in the 18 or 20 years since Dr. Rice did his pioneer work. 
Several of the larger cities have established permanent bureaus of effi-

ciency. Those of Baltimore, New Orleans, Rochester, and New York 
City were mentioned in the Report of the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion for the year 1913. Since then similar departments have been 
established in Boston, Mass.; Detroit, Mich.; Kansas City, Mo.; and 
Oakland, Cal. Baltimore has discontinued its bureau, whether 
temporarily or permanently is not stated. The Boston “department 
of educational investigation and measurement”? and the Detroit 
“department of educational research” are operated along similar 
lines, though the Boston department has set for itself one task not 
specifically mentioned in the Detroit list of undertakings, namely, to 
- work out a plan for the promotion of teachers on the basis of merit. 
In the Detroit report the aims of the department are stated as follows: 
1. To measure the efficiency of the teaching in the Detroit schools. 
2. To increase the number of children benefiting by school work. 
8. To eliminate waste in subject matter and methods. 
4, To aid in the adjustment of school training to the world’s needs. 
5. To help teachers give greater assistance to individual children in accordance 
with their peculiar weaknesses. 
6. To set up objective standards, reasonable because based upon the measured 
ability of children, so that each child may have the pleasure of success. 
7. To aid the superintendent and others in the preparation of reports. 
8. To aid in the continued professional training of teachers. 
9. To supply any information about the Detroit system that may be wanted. 
10. To maintain year after year a critical study of the Detroit public schools in 
order that each year the same may be made more efficient. 
This Detroit enterprise emphasizes a tendency which has very 
recently developed in our large cities toward placing all experimental 
work in the hands of one person who can give it his undivided atten- 
tion. The Detroit department, besides furnishing the statistical and 
reference service common to all such departments, proposes to con- 
duct such researches as the department can carry on through paid 
assistants, and in addition to organize and direct educational research 
among volunteer workers in, the school system. This is to be cooper- 
ative work. By subdividing the various investigations into small 
parts, only a few hours’ time on the part of any one teacher will be 
required. Not every teacher is fitted by training to take part in 
pure research, nor is every teacher desirous of participating. It is 
believed, however, that in Detroit enough volunteer workers will 
offer to cooperate in a clearly outlined plan that has for its general 
purpose the lightening of the labor and burden of teaching, which is 
“the blind unsuccessful struggle against unrecognized obstacles.” 
To this end tentative standards of measurement of results in arithme- 
tic, handwriting, English composition, and spelling, based upon the 
measurement of many thousands of children in Detroit and other 
cities, are explained, and the aim set up to determine the degree of 
skill that should be developed. Methods are to be found “which
-P-A-G-E-79
  
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 41 
will develop optimum degrees of the mechanical skills with the least 
expenditure of time and effort.” These are to be desired “because 
of the large amount of time that would be set free for work of greater 
value.”’ The standards arrived at leave the teacher free to choose 
his own methods of securing an output of the quality desired. 
“The whole effort toward standardization has for its purpose not 
the increase of mechanical drill work, but its reduction to a safe 
minimum.” The clear recognition which the Detroit department of 
educational research gives to the fact that in the three R’s it is a 
waste of time to drill for the attainment of standards of work that 
are beyond the reach of a majority of the children constitutes a 
service in a field in which an authoritative statement of this kind 
was much needed. It may yet be possible to retain the best features 
of our enriched curriculum by utilizing time saved from needless and 
fruitless drill. We need not fear that standardization of the three 
R’s, the tools of education, will affect adversely the work as a whole. 
On the contrary, it will set free a vast amount of misdirected energy 
that may be applied to really educative work. 
Newton, Mass., and Orange, N. J., furnish instances of university 
and city cooperation in establishing standards. The Harvard-Newton 
experiment was in the direction of developing a scale of measurement 
in composition; that of Teachers’ College and Orange arrived at a 
uniform method of marking examination papers. 
In numerous instances surveys are being systematically made by 
the regular teaching and supervisory force. Some of these are limited 
in scope; others cover the entire field. As instances of the limited 
survey, East Saginaw, Seattle, and Lawrence may be mentioned as 
typical—East Saginaw in primary reading, arithmetic, and eighth- 
grade composition; Seattle and Lawrence in arithmetic. A very 
suggestive inside survey, conducted under expert outside advice, has 
been reported by Supt. R. G. Jones, of Rockford, Tl. Of inside sur- 
veys covering the entire field, that of Chicago, undertaken and com- 
pleted within the year under review, is the most complete example 
appearing in available reports. The Chicago survey was made by 
320 superintendents, supervisors, principals, and teachers employed 
in the schools of the city. The printed report of the survey, occupy- 
ing 256 pages, appears in the form of reports of 25 committees, each 
charged with the duty of examining a single feature of the Chicago 
school system.t 
The survey included the following features: School plant, adminis- 
tration, child study, physical education, humane and moral educa- 
tion, social efficiency, music, training of teachers, kindergartens, 
  
1 The report is given as pp. 31 to 287 of the annual report of the superintendent for the year ending June 
30,1914, For further details with regard to this survey, especially in the vocational phase, see p. 250 of this 
report,

    42 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
reading, spelling, penmanship, arithmetic and mathematics, geog- 
raphy and nature study, history, German, art construction, industrial 
and prevocational education, commercial education in high schools, 
vocational work in technical high schools, vocational guidance, a 
bureau of vocational guidance, special schools, penny lunches, cor- 
rective institutions. 
Every school had a representative on the survey committees. Each 
committee had for its chairman a member of the superintendent’s 
staff. No specialist teaching the subject assigned to a committee 
could be a member of that committee. For instance, the chairman 
of the committee on training of teachers was the director of the 
department of child study. The chairman of the committee on read- 
ing in elementary schools was the supervisor of household art. Asso- 
ciated with her were seven elementary school principals, two men and 
five women, and seven teachers of household arts. ; 
In the reports both defects and excellencies of the schools are set 
forth together with suggestions for improvement. Each report rep- 
resents the opinions of the members of the committee whose signa- 
tures it bears, and is, of course, authoritative to just that extent. 
No reference is made to practice in other school systems, and it does 
not appear that any tests in the fundamentals as tried out elsewhere 
were used. This survey is certainly unique in that it would inevi- 
tably result in a fresh point of view upon each topic, care having been 
taken that no single surveyor should be an expert in the field that he 
surveyed. 
Doubtless the survey gives a reliable picture of the Chicago school 
system. There can be no question that the 320 committee members 
engaged in the survey were personally and professionally benefited 
by their excursion into fields with which they had previously only a 
general acquaintance, and this alone is an asset to the system. The 
desire for efficiency which furnishes the motive for these inside sur- 
veys leads naturally to experimentation, and thus we find reported, 
together with present conditions, the means that are being tried out 
looking toward improvement. The annual report thus becomes an 
educational document suggestive to teachers within and without the 
system, as well as informing to the local public. 
The East Saginaw experiment in fourth-grade reading may serve 
as an illustration. After detailing the methods used in testing read- 
ing in various grades and the status of the work as shown by the 
tests applied, the report continues: 
Another experiment tried in the reading classes of the fourth-grade Germania School 
during several months of the year was designed to furnish a better motive for oral 
reading than that found in the ordinary reading class. In the usual reading class, 
all members of the class have the same book, and all look on the book while one 
of their number reads aloud. The pupil who reads thus has no incentive to give 
an idea to his listeners, for they are reading themselves and getting the ideas for
-P-A-G-E-81
  
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 43 
themselves. The listeners have no incentive to give attention to the reader, for 
they know what he will say beforehand. The only motive in such a class is the nega- 
tive one of criticism. The reader desires to pronounce his words correctly so as to 
avoid criticism, and to emphasize the passage read in such a way as to show that he 
understands its meaning. The listening pupils are trying to trip the reader, to dis- 
cover in his reading a faulty pronunciation or a wrong emphasis. Such states of mind 
can not produce the best results on either side. The oral reading class should properly 
be an exercise in which the reader is giving to his hearers ideas new to them. Then 
the reader’s motive is to speak his words clearly and to emphasize his sentences 
properly, to the end that his listeners may understand what he is reading. The lis- 
teners’ motive is to understand what is being read, to determine whether it is of interest 
tothem. An attempt was made in the fourth grade, Germania, to conduct the reading 
class in this way. Each pupil was given a different book from every other, and as 
each pupil’s turn to read came he stood in front of the school and read to his classmates. 
If they did not understand what was being read, they asked the reader to repeat. 
Each pupil kept the same book and read from it day after day, stating each day at the 
beginning of his recitation the point of the selection at which he had arrived in the 
previous reading. The listening pupils were able to carry in mind the different 
pieces read, so that there was little loss on this account. The spirit of this reading 
class was excellent, and the success of the experiment was such as to warrant a con- 
tinuation of this sort of reading in certain classes next year. 
Such standard tests as have been developed have been widely 
used during the year. Seattle, in the extreme West, and Lawrence, 
in the extreme East, report at length upon the Courtis tests in arith- 
metic as given in their schools. In Lawrence the tests were given 
early in the year and again near its close. After a description of the 
tests and the record of results, the superintendent gives the following 
keen estimate of their value: 
The chief value of the test, however, does not lie in the average of the results, nor 
is the efficiency of the school system as a whole measured chiefly by average scores of 
the grades. The average results in one school system do not differ greatly from those 
of other school systems. Different systems do, however, show on the face of the 
average scores certain weaknesses in general methods of teaching, or mistaken em- 
phasis, poor grading, and so on. But the most significant thing is not the average 
ability discovered by means of the test, but the wide variability of arithmetical power 
revealed. Averages are of little account, since there are found more children who 
differ from the average than there are children of average ability, From the stand- 
point of efficient teaching, the significance of the results is not so much that the average 
of a sixth-grade class get a certain number of attempted examples right, but that in 
this sixth grade are found children of every level of ability, from those who can do 
none of the examples to those that can do them all. This was really the one great 
value of the test: That it demonstrated to teachers, in a tremendously effective 
manner, that the factor of individual differences is the basic factor in all school work, 
that the methods that do not recognize it are wasteful in the extreme, and that the 
only way of increasing our efficiency is to base our school work on the measured need 
of the individual and by so modifying our present system of class teaching as to provide 
for supplementary individual instruction. 
Tt has, too, been an eye opener to teachers in that it has proven that drill in abstract 
work beyond a certain point is not only futile, but may actually reduce accuracy in 
problem work. Most critics of the schools, particularly the business man in whose 
memory of hisschool days the “drills” in arithmetic hold sucha prominent place, have 
attributed the weakness of children in arithmetic to neglect ‘to learn their tables”’   
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  44 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
in the lowergrades. The tests showed plainly that much drill in the tables and com- 
binations, while)it may give a class higher speed, affects its accuracy but slightly, and 
is pretty sure to be fatal to. a proper growth of reasoning. 
The outside survey discloses only present conditions. Under cer- 
tain circumstances this service is valuable to the community in which 
the survey takes place, but it has a wider value, as has already been 
suggested, in contributing to common knowledge of methods of pro- 
cedure, in helping to perfect measuring units or standards already 
worked out, and in adding perhaps to the list of units of measurement 
available. Workers in any school system now find at hand well- 
attested means of determining the efficiency of their work in at least 
a few fields, and the reports of the current year furnish evidence that 
they are availing themselves of these means. 
A decade ago the self-complacency of the average schoolman 
stirred the unaympathetic among lay spokesmen to make sweeping 
statements condemnatory of public-school procedure in general. 
Then it became the fashion upon many an educational platform 
for the schoolman, especially when far from home, to outdo the 
layman in criticism of public-school work. Both layman and 
schoolman, however, dealt in generalities, and one was as little 
helpful as the other. A more self-respecting attitude now charac- 
terizes the utterances of the average schoolman. He feels obiiged 
neither to declare his work perfect nor to condemn it in toto. He 
has means of comparison at his disposal by which he is able to show 
definitely in what respects his schools are up to accepted standards 
in efficiency and in what respects they are lacking. In other words, 
the progress made in his field through research and survey have 
enabled him to assume a scientific attitude toward his work. 
REORGANIZATION OF GRADES. 
In reports from nearly 40: cities of the group under consideration 
mention is made either of actual or proposed reorganization of the 
upper grammar grades to provide for differentiation of work for 
pupils in accordance with tastes and aptitudes and probable career 
and to facilitate departmental teaching. The six-year course of 
study for the elementary grades, followed by a six-year period 
divided between the intermediate school and the high school, is 
finding favor in the cities covered by this chapter. This division 
is sometimes 3—3 and sometimes 2—4, but the feature that stands 
out in most cases reported is the grouping of upper-grade pupils in 
central buildings for greater convenience in construction. In some 
cities, as Rochester, N. Y., Ogden, Utah, and Salt Lake City, Utah, 
the grades thus brought together are called the junior high school; 
in some, as Oakland, Cal., they are called the intermediate school; 
in some the term used is departmental grammar school; and there
-P-A-G-E-83
  SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 45. 
are others where the grades in which departmental teaching occurs 
are not given any separate designation. 
Many superintendents who would not approve that extreme form 
of departmental teaching in the grammar grades in which the pupil 
has a different teacher for each subject find advantages in a consery- 
ative plan by which two or three teachers divide the work of as 
many classes in accordance with their tastes and abilities. The 
arguments against departmental teaching in the elementary school 
that were frequently heard a few years ago applied with consider- 
able force to the extreme form of the plan. It was held that it 
tended to make teachers narrow, to overburden the pupil, to impair 
discipline, to overemphasize the function of knowledge in education, 
and to destroy the unity of school life for the pupil. 
The extreme form of the departmental plan in general use in 
colleges and large high schools, however, has not found place to 
any large extent, if at all, in elementary school procedure. As a 
rule, under the compromise plan now generally followed, every class 
in a grammar-grade departmental organization has its teacher to 
whom each member of the class is directly responsible in matters 
of attendance, conduct, study, and recitation. The class may report 
to another teacher in another room for one or more exercises, but 
the regular or home-room teacher feels a definite responsibility for 
the class wherever it may be, and there is a very close cooperation 
between the teachers of a departmental group. The great expan- 
sion of the grammar-grade course of study through the enrichment 
that has been brought about in recent years has made the burden 
of subject matter weigh so heavily upon the teachers of these grades 
that they have been unable to do creditable work in all the subjects. 
Time and strength were not equal to the task of adequate prepara- 
tion for the daily work. It was therefore inevitable that some 
favorite subjects would be well taught. while others, for which a 
given teacher had less aptitude, would be handled in mediocre 
fashion. 
The welfare of the pupil, too, calls for some readjustment of plans 
in view of the demands of modern life and the presence in the course 
of study of vastly more subject matter than any pupil can master. 
Consequently, the problem of differentiating courses in the upper 
grammar grades has become a vital and pressing one. 
Among the cities of 25,000 or more.inhabitants whose reports are 
available the following emphasize either departmental teaching or 
differentiated courses in upper grammar grades, or some form of the 
six-and-six plan, or all three in combination. Doubtless in some 
cities this modification has become so well established that it is no 
longer a matter calling for especial comment in reports; consequently

_ The discussions of departmental organization and differentiated 
courses found in the reports may be summarized somewhat as follows: 
Not only educational principles but also certain obvious facts suggest that in 
the upper grades there should be differentiation of instruction to meet the varying 
needs of different groups of children.. The traditional uniform academic course, 
with perhaps some little time given to manual training or domestic science, which 
still prevails in many cities is an arrangement good enough for pupils who are to 
have a long period of schooling; but much more profitable courses can be offered for 
pupils whom economic impulse will force into productive work at a comparatively 
early age. The latter class of pupils are now leaving school at various points from 
the fourth or fifth grade on, and often just as soon as they reach the legal limit of 
compulsory schooling. They quit school because of the attraction of wages, it is 
true, but chiefly because they have natural inclinations that lead away from the 
bookish interests of pupils destined ultimately to enter the professions; and such 
unliterary pupils would remain in school longer and receive more adequate trainit.g 
for good citizenship and efficient social service if the school offered, alongside the 
academic work, parallel courses of industrial, commercial, and domestic instruction. 
Into the latter lines of activity many pupils will eventually go, and they will prove 
much more reliable and contented employees if they have received instruction 
enlightening them in the importance and dignity of callings other than the so-called 
professions, and if they have been given an introductory training preparing them 
for the rapid acquisition of skill when they enter particular lines of business or defi- 
nite trades. 
The foregoing considerations point to the desirability of differentiation of school 
work at the beginning of the seventh grade. Boys and girls certain to go into the 
high school (and in a number of cases even to college) would continue to pursue 
through the seventh and eighth grades the present academic studies with the added 
privilege, entirely optional, however, of beginning a foreign language at the age of 
12 to 14 years, when the drill incident to language acquisition is most acceptably 
undertaken. Pupils, on the other hand, destined to begin work toward self-support 
at an early age, either in business or in the industrial field, would find in the pro- 
posed seventh and eighth grade industrial courses just the sort of instruction and 
training most interesting to them and most profitable for the future life work to which 
they are to devote themselves. Moreover, the industrial instruction and practice 
desired can be developed along either or both of two lines: (1) The prevocational 
course to awaken interest in industrial pursuits and disclose the natural bent of the 
pupil; (2) specific trade training courses for those in whose cases decision has been 
made for this or that leading trade of the community. Finally, the proposed domestic

  SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 47 
course for seventh and eighth grade classes will afford to many girls the only oppor- 
tunity they will ever have for systematic instruction toward becoming in the future 
the efficient home makers that every community so sorely needs. 
Differentiation of instruction in the upper grades naturally suggests Cepartmental 
teaching, because no single teacher can be expected to teach the whole range of sub- 
jects included in the group of parallel differentiated courses. Departmental teach- 
ing is the plan common in high schools, where several teachers cooperate in the 
instruction of a group of classes by having the classes pass from teacher to teacher, 
receiving from each teacher instruction in only a single subject or in but two or three 
related subjects. This plan of teaching is to be recommended for grammar-grade 
classes, at any rate for the seventh and eighth grades, whether or not differentiated 
courses are offered. It is true that departmental teaching in the elementary school 
has dangers (for example, the overworking of pupils), that must be guarded against; 
but any competent principal with intelligent assistants, frequently conferring to- 
gether, can avoid the possible disadvantages of departmental instruction and secure 
all the real advantages of the plan. 
Of these advantages the following may be here enumerated: Better teaching, 
better equipment, enriched curriculum, promotion by subject, improved physical 
conditions for pupils, interest and stimulus of several teachers instead of one only, 
college graduates in grammar grade positions, transition to high-school attitude and 
methods. 
No argument is needed to establish the fact that a teacher can become more expert 
in her teaching when she has to prepare upon only one subject or a few related sub- 
jects, and these subjects also in the line of her special interests, than when she must 
prepare upon the whole round of subjects now taught in the seventh and eighth grades 
of any progressive school system. Similarly, it is a great advantage to the pupil to 
be taken on from grade to grade in a given subject by the same teacher, an expert in the 
particular subject. Again, no argument is needed to show that a given outlay to 
purchase equipment for, say, geography instruction, will go much further when 
applied in the fitting up of a single room, the geography teacher’s room, than when 
divided up among several rooms to give each of several teachers a share of the equip- 
ment for her geography lessons. Better teaching and better equipment inevitably 
bring aboutan enriched curriculum; for each of the teachers, in learning more and more 
about her chosen subject and in accumulating more and more equipment, will step by 
step develop the more important phases of her work and give less attention to or even 
discard entirely the less important phases; and, moreover, every study in the course, 
being in the hands of a sort of specialist, will receive its due share of time and atten- 
tion, and will be taught so as to stir interest and produce truly educative effects. 
On the other hand, when a pupil has difficulty with any subject, the departmental 
plan, in affording a medium for promotion by subject, makes it an easy matter to 
advance this pupil in everything he has been successful with, while at the same time 
holding him back for review upon the subject only in which he has failed. Pupils 
also enjoy improved physical conditions under the departmental plan in getting the 
relief, activity, and variety afforded by moving from room to room as the periods of 
the day roll by. Many a pupil who finds school irksome and monotonous, or even 
repellent, under the one-teacher plan, especially with a teacher not of the highest 
efficiency, will develop a new interest and pleasure in his work under the stimulus of 
several teachers cooperating in departmental organization. 
It is just the departmental organization, moreover, that will bring into the grammar 
grades scholarly and enthusiastic college graduates, for college graduates entering 
the school service have quite as lively an interest in seventh and eighth grade children 
as in high-school pupils; but the task of teaching the whole work of a grade, including 
subjects quite outside the teacher’s special interests, is not attractive to one who has 
gone to college for the express purpose of getting superior knowledge and training in 
the two or three selected subjects that the candidate wants to teach,    
-P-A-G-E-86
  48 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Finally, and as a consequence of all the foregoing, departmental instruction in 
grammar grades is an admirable device for mediating the transition from the elemen- 
tary school to the high school, because under this plan pupils are introduced gradually 
to high-school methods and assume quite easily the high-school attitude; and although 
this consideration may be said to apply only to the pupils who go on to the high schools, 
it is nevertheless an important factor both in determining how many will thus prolong 
their schooling beyond the eighth grade and also in unifying the whole school system 
of a city, 
In Ogden the last six years of the course are organized with a 
longer school day than is customary elsewhere and with the longer 
day divided into half-day sessions—a half day of academic work 
and a half day of industrial, social, and physical work, the academic 
studies being put in each half day and the industrial studies in each 
half day. Any pupil who can show that he has better industrial, 
commercial, or other work outside of school than the school program 
furnishes may be excused from any part of the industrial half day 
to take his industrial work outside of the school. This plan applies 
to girls as well as boys. A mother with a large family of children 
may need her daughter’s assistance for an hour or two in the morning 
orin the afternoon. The girl may be excused for any part of the day for 
a time not exceeding three and one-half hours without losing any of 
her academic studies. Before granting excuse each case is carefully 
investigated to make sure that the home has the proper attitude and 
that the industrial work which it affords is equal to that which the 
school offers. Those who can not prove their case remain in the 
junior high school during the entire session, which begins at 8.30 in 
the morning and ends at 4.30 in the afternoon. The plan enables 
the school officers to bring back to the schoolroom many boys and 
girls who have left school to enter wage-earning occupations, and 
these pupils may take their academic studies and go on to graduation 
as rapidly as those who are in school all day. The industrial work 
they are doing outside is accepted as equal in value to that which 
others do in school. 
THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
Tnasmuch as several reports referred to in the foregoing lay especial 
emphasis upon another feature of school policy that has become 
increasingly prominent of late, it seems proper to make mention of 
them as typical instances of the organization of industrial work in 
connection with departmental teaching and the intermediate school. 
Rochester, N. Y., uses the term “junior high school” to designate a 
school which comprises the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. As 
the school population increases, it is the newly adopted policy in that 
city to build junior high schools in various sections of the city, instead 
of enlarging existing grammar schools, leaving these schools for the 
younger pupils of the first six grades. Prior to the adoption of this 
plan the number of pupils in any one of the grammar schools was so
-P-A-G-E-87
  SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 49 
small as to make practically impossible any differentiation of courses 
in the upper grades. By the new grouping of upper grade pupils the 
advantage of departmental instruction and some choice of courses 
are open to all pupils of grades 7, 8, and 9 throughout the city. 
Beyond the junior high schools are the senior high schools, two in 
number, in which the work of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth years 
is carried on. In Ogden, Utah, the schools are organized on the 
6—2—4 plan, the seventh and eighth grades constituting the junior 
high school. In Oakland, Cal., the seventh and eighth grades are 
organized on the departmental plan, some in a separate school known 
as the intermediate school and others in existing grammar schools in 
which other grades are also housed. They are known as depart- 
mental grammar schools. In these schools 15 hours a week are 
prescribed, viz, English, 5 hours; arithmetic, 3 hours; music, 2 hours; 
history and geography, 5 hours. From the following electives 10 or 
15 hours a week may be chosen: Drawing, 2 to 5 hours; manual 
training or domestic science and art, 2 to 10 hours; literature or 
foreign language, 5 hours. In the intermediate school, 5 hours of 
science and 5 hours of typing (eighth grade only) will be offered next 
term. One of the grammar schools is vocational. In this school 
electives are limited to 5 hours of drawing and 10 to 20 hours of shop- 
work per week. Credit is given in the high school for the satisfactory 
completion of work in foreign language in the departmental grammar 
schools. Owing to the very elementary nature of the instruction 
thus far given in industrial subjects, high-school credit is not allowed. 
The plan, however, contemplates advanced standing in these subjects 
also. A majority of the instructors are university graduates and 
experienced elementary teachers. Each has been chosen because 
of special preparation or proficiency. The cost of instruction has 
been increased, partly because the salary schedule has been increased 
and partly because more subjects are taught or there is a greater 
time allotment for electives.

  50 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Supt. A. C. Barker says: These schools have not been organized long enough to reach 
a final conclusion as to their efficiency. The elective system offers a greater oppor- 
tunity to pupils. It may be questioned whether a pupil should study a foreign lan- 
guage, but if he is ever to study it, he should preferably make a beginning before the 
high-school age. 
The transition state in which many school systems are at present 
in the matter of organization of grades is well illustrated by Kala- 
mazoo, Mich., where for several years the school authorities have 
been working toward the senior and junior high-school plan. Depart- 
mental schools approaching the junior high-school arrangement had 
been in operation for 8 or 10 years. The promotion requirements 
were the same as in the high school, viz, by subject. Hence, a pupil 
might begin high-school studies before he had finished all of his 
eighth-grade work. Until 1914, however, there had been but little 
departure from traditional lines of work in the grammar grades. 
This year some optional work has been offered with this aim: A 
chance for pupils to take either Latin or German and hence start on a 
course of collegiate preparation; a chance for another group to begin 
work in bookkeeping and typewriting and hence start toward a 
commercial course; a chance for still another group to begin optional 
courses in manual training that had hitherto been offered only in the 
high school. Beginning in September, 1914, the Central High School 
will enroll the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades, and the depart- 
mental schools the seventh, eighth, and ninth, while the first six 
grades will form a'separate unit. 
Throughout New England it is a common practice to bring together 
the upper grammar grades in centrally located buildings for conven- 
ience and economy in carrying on the departmental system of instruc- 
tion. As a rule the primary schools are small neighborhood schools, 
while the grammar schools receiving pupils each from several primary 
schools are large. The number of grades housed in these centrally 
located buildings varies according to local conditions. The depart- 
mental system of instruction is usually practiced in them whether 
differentiated courses are offered or not. These organizations ap- 
proach the intermediate or junior high-school organization, though 
without any fixed rule as to number of grades. They offer an easy 
transition to the 6—3—3 plan or the 6—2—4 plan with differentiated 
courses after the sixth grade, departmental teaching, and promotion 
by subject. Along with this unsettled condition of intermediate grade 
organization in New England a change is in progress as to the number 
of grades below the high school. This is true also of Pennsylvania. 
Harrisburg is preparing to follow the examples of the other cities in 
the State. Within the past year Steelton, Lebanon, and Williamsport 
have changed from nine grades to eight, and only three or four cities 
still continue under the old nine-grade plan. Salem, Pittsfield, Fall 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 51 
River, and Taunton, Mass., are changing from nine grades to eight. 
Fully one-half of the cities in Massachusetts had made the change 
prior to the present year. Holyoke, Mass., is considering the change, 
including the adoption of the 6—3—3 plan, with manual training in 
grades 7, 8, and 9 on a practical arts basis. Springfield, Mass., has 
substituted algebra and commercial arithmetic for the review arith- 
metic formerly required of all pupils in the ninth grade, the pupils 
choosing the one or the other study in accordance with their high- 
school aims and receiving high-school credit for the work. Especially 
able pupils are allowed to begin German in the eighth grade, receiving 
high-school credit in this subject also. Thus the ninth grade has in 
part been absorbed into the high school and seems likely at no distant 
day to disappear. New England is averse to radical changes, but never- 
theless the section is plainly moving toward the general adoption of 
the new grouping of grades known as the 6—3—3 plan. Somerville, 
Mass., has recently organized one of its largest elementary schools 
with differentiated courses above the sixth grade, and Boston has 
begun the organization of junior high schools on an extensive scale. 
It may be questioned, however, whether the 6—3—8 plan, though 
undoubtedly growing in popularity, will gain possession of the entire 
field. For several years the Gary plan has been attracting attention. 
Its limited adoption in New York City has intensified interest, and 
school men everywhere are giving it serious study. As carried out 
in its home city, the most marked contrast to the 6—3—3 plan which 
the Gary plan presents is that of keeping children of all ages together. 
In the 6—3—3 plan we have three distinct groups; the primary pupils 
are handled as one unit, the intermediate or junior high-school pupils 
as another unit in a separate central building, while the senior high 
school represents another distinct organization. An advantage is 
claimed for this segregation on psychological grounds. It is held that 
there is an advantage in separating young children, especially in their 
play, from adolescents. The other arguments for segregation deal 
with economy and efficiency, one prominent argument being based on 
the need of bringing together a large number of children of like attain- 
ments to facilitate departmental instruction and differentiated courses 
in intermediate grades. In the Gary plan, on the contrary, it is 
thought important educationally that the younger children see tho 
older children at work in the shops and laboratories, and that the 
older children help the younger children with their tasks. Accord- 
ingly, all the grades from the kindergarten to the end of the high 
school are under one roof, and definitely arranged observation periods 
are planned in which the younger pupils see the older pupils engaged 
in all the variety of industrial work of the course. Experience is said 
to justify the belief that with the opportunity to see interesting activ- 
ities in progress in which they are later to participate the younger
-P-A-G-E-90
  52 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
children gain an interest in school of great holding power, and that the 
beneficial effect of this is most noticeable in grades where attendance 
usually decreases so radically.t 
In New York the Gary plan is being applied in two grades only— 
the seventh and eighth—in boys’ classes in six large elementary 
schools. The advantages sought appear to be economy in the use of 
available space and a practicable method of conducting prevocational 
training for the industries. By using certain classrooms for two dif- 
ferent sets of pupils other classrooms may be taken for shops, and 
thus even in congested sections of the metropolis every boy of these 
two grades may have a try-out experience in some one line of indus- 
try. In Gary a boy is not limited to experience in a single trade; he 
' becomes familiar with a wide range of materials and processes. Kan- 
sas City is conducting one school on the Gary plan. Supt. Charles 
S. Clark, of Somerville, Mass., after visiting New York City, Gary, and 
several smaller places in which the Gary plan is being tried, has rec- 
ommended that the alternating plan be employed in Somerville to 
relieve the overcrowding that exists in several parts of the city. 
THE VOCATIONAL TREND IN EDUCATION.” 
The three most prominent topics in city school reports of the pres- 
ent year relate to definiteness in supervision, changes in grade organ- 
ization, and vocational training. Nearly every report available either 
mentions vocational training as already established or in the organi- 
zation stage. The ordinary manual training courses seem no longer 
to satisfy conditions. They are giving place to courses called indus- 
trial, vocational, or, in the case of the earlier courses, prevocational. 
It might seem that the movement toward fitting boys and girls in 
school for practical efficiency in their life work was fast superseding 
harmonious development through liberal education, if we did not 
remember that the older so-called liberal form of education is so 
strongly intrenched as to call for no advocacy at the present time. 
The present concern seems to be for the large number of boys and 
girls who under the old régime found little of value in the curriculum 
because they could not or did not remain in school long enough to 
profit by it. It is not proposed to make artisans of those who by 
nature and circumstance-tend to go in another direction. The lit- 
erary curriculum is vocational for them, and it is still open to them. 
The intention of differentiated courses after the sixth grade seems to 
be to organize education on a vocational basis not for the few, as for- 
merly, but for all. The advocates of early vocational education have 
no fear that their propaganda will endanger liberal education. On 
the contrary, they hold that the reorganization of education on a

SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 53 
vocational basis will give motive for extended education, and thus 
provide time and opportunity for liberal culture. They advocate the 
education of the individual along the lines of his greatest endowment 
and as broadly as possible. The antiquated liberal plan assumed that 
those who found books too much for them would drift into the ranks 
of the manual workers and get on as best they could there. In aban- 
doning this view it is not necessary to go to the opposite extreme, 
namely, that pupils should be tested and all who prove to be skillful 
with their hands be trained for the trades and those who show no 
aptitude for handwork be left to drift into the professions. The one 
test is no more decisive than the other. Of the two, however, the 
- second is less fraught with danger, for in the shop as well as in the 
classroom there is opportunity to discover pupils who are fitted to 
deal with theories and general applications of ideas. 
OTHER TOPICS EMPHASIZED IN THE ANNUAL REPORTS. 
Agriculture and gardening.—It is interesting to note that instruc- 
tion in agriculture is not limited to the high schools of rural com- 
munities. Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has a school farm on which experi- 
mental work is carried on as a part of the high-school work, with the 
cooperation of the State agricultural college at Ames. Indianapolis 
has a farm of 76 acres, with orchard, tillable fields, and forest which is 
utilized by classes of the Technical High School. Cleveland, Ohio, is 
another large city in which success has been achieved in the teaching 
of agriculture. Kingston, N. Y., high school has an 8-acre field, part 
of which will be used for instruction in intensive agriculture; in 
San Jose, Cal., an orchard and farm have been rented, where students 
can supplement their laboratory work with practical work in the 
field. Duluth reports an agricultural course in the high school which 
is valuable and popular. Decatur, Youngstown, and Oklahoma City 
are considering the purchase of school farms. St. Louis has placed 
all its school gardens under the care of a supervisor. In Elmira, 
N. Y., achievement clubs (for city and county) are carried on with 
the cooperation of Cornell University and the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. They encourage achievement in agriculture 
and domestic work. 
Architecture.-—The 1-story school building already well known in 
California and the South is finding favor in colder climates. The 
Madison, Wis., school report refers with approval to the Elwanger 
and Barry School, of Rochester, N. Y., and reproduces the floor plans 
of the school, together with the architect’s description of the building. 
Two more 1-story schools are now under construction in Rochester 
on the same plan. Some of the advantages claimed for a school 
building of this type are: The reduced cost of construction; the 
elasticity of plan that provides rooms varying in size for the work in
-P-A-G-E-92
    54 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
special lines without disturbing the school unit on which the building 
is planned; the method of overhead lighting; the independent exits 
for each schoolroom; the independence and freedom of different 
departments in the way of management; and the possibility of con- 
structing different portions at different times, and of making additions 
at any time, without undue expense and without interfering with the 
unity of the structure. During the brief time the 1-story school has 
been in use in Rochester it has been found no more expensive to main- 
tain nor more difficult to administer than other buildings. Nor has 
any more discomfort been experienced on account of summer heat. 
It has been as easy to maintain an even temperature in the 1-story 
school as in other buildings. The type of roof used is the saw tooth. 
The light comes in from the north and enters the rooms in such a 
manner that there are no shadows. The superintendent reports that 
experience in Rochester is so favorable that they will go on building 
i-story schools wherever practicable. 
Attendance laws.—Cities in Ohio and Massachusetts have had new 
problems thrust upon them under the operation of new attendance 
laws which went into effect in September, 1913. In Ohio, boys must 
attend school until they have finished the sixth grade and are 15 
years of age; otherwise, until they are 16. Girls must attend until 
they are 16 years of age, and have finished the seventh grade; other- 
wise, until they are 18. At present an effort is being made to change 
this law so as to enable any pupil who is 14 years of age or over and has 
completed the eighth grade to receive an age and schooling certificate. 
The effect of such a provision is manifest. The parents would become 
the truant officers. Those parents of laggards who care little for the 
progress of their children, and seem to be chiefly interested in the 
time when they may go to work, would probably take an interest in 
having their children do their very best, if the law were thus changed. 
Under the new Massachusetts law the individual who wishes to work 
after he is 14 years of age must be able to show reasonable regular 
attendance during the year following his thirteenth birthday. The 
following are the principal features of the laws as they apply to 
persons between 14 and 16 years of age: 
1. Must read well enough to complete the fourth grade in the schools. 
2. May work but 48 hours per week. 
3. Must be certified as to health by a physician. 
4, May not be employed in any of a long list of dangerous employments enumerated. 
5. Must be employed at regular work for wages at least six hours per day or must be 
in school, or must have written permission from the superintendent to be 
employed at home. 
A defect of the former law has been corrected by requiring the 
employer to return to the superintendent of schools the working cer- 
tificate of any minor as soon as his employment ceases. Thus the
-P-A-G-E-93
    SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 55 
attendance officer is enabled to see that the minor is either at work 
or in school. 
The difficulties experienced under the new law in several mill cities 
of Massachusetts have been similar to those of Lawrence—the mills 
run 54 hours per week, while children may work but 48 hours per 
week. The following is quoted from the Lawrence report: 
The law compelling children to remain in school until their sixteenth birthday, 
unless they be regularly employed under a proper certificate, would have affected but 
slightly the conditions which prevailed for a good many years. But the passage, in 
conjunction with it, of a law which limited the hours of labor for minors under 16 to 8 
in any one day, complicated the situation considerably. Children, to be sure, can 
still leave school to go to work at 14. Butif employers do not wish to hire them under 
the 8-hour day law, then they are virtually compelled to remain in school until they 
are 16. That is what actually happened this year. There was a temporary dullness 
in the textile industry at the time these laws became effective. There was, too, con- 
siderable practical difficulty in fitting an 8-hour day for these minors to the regular 
working schedule of the mills. Upon the part of a few of the largest employers of minor 
labor there was no effort made to adjust their mills to the demands of the 8-hour day 
law for these children. These mills not only ceased to employ minors under 16, but 
discharged all under that age already on their pay rolls. In this manner, about 600 
boys and girls were forced out of employment around September 1. More than 100 
of them reentered school of their own accord. Many others received employment as 
soon as they reached their sixteenth birthday. A considerable number of them found 
employment, even before they became 16, in the two or three mills which continued 
to employ children under 16, in spite of the 8-hour day limitation. About 50 were 
found to have removed from the city. Nearly all the rest are at home, in not a few 
instances taking the place of the mother who, in order to keep the family income 
sufficient for actual needs, has gone into the mill in the place of the son or daughter 
forced out of employment as a result of the 8-hour day law. The law authorizes the 
superintendent of schools to issue permits to children under 16 who are ‘‘profitably 
employed at home.” A careful investigation of all these remaining cases is already 
under way, and home permits will be issued wherever the reported facts seem to 
justify it, 
Consulting psychologist—Two cities—Seattle and St. Louis—have 
added to their equipment for effective work with children who deviate 
from the normal by organizing centers for laboratory and observa- ° 
tional purposes. In St. Louis the center is called the psycho-educa- 
tional clinic, and a trained clinical psychologist has been placed in 
charge. 
Course of study.—Revision of the course of study, as in former years, 
is in progress in many cities. Salem, Mass., issues its course in loose- 
leaf form to facilitate minor changes. In Worcester a minimum and 
maximum course is being worked out, the minimum course containing 
all the essentials, but omitting many details of the maximum course. 
This course is designed for schools attended largely by children who 
speak at home a foreign language. In Newark the changes in the 
course look toward the correlation of evening, day, and summer 
schools. In Hast Orange, N. J., the entire course for grades and 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  56 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
high school has been revised and final examinations as a basis of 
promotion abandoned. <A general revision of the course of study, 
which was begun last year in St. Louis with a study of the principles 
underlying the curriculum, is continued this year in the work of 
subcommittees of supervisors, principals, and teachers on the several 
subjects of the course. Several southern cities are revising the ele- 
mentary course of study for their colored schools, with a view to im- 
proving the industrial features of the courses. In Savannah, Ga., 
90 minutes a day in the seventh and eighth grades are to be given 
to industrial work, including sewing, cooking, house cleaning, serving 
meals, sanitation, and house service for girls and varied manual train- 
ing for boys. The regular academic work remains about as before. 
The general tendency evident in revisions of the course of study in 
progress is summed up by Supt. Hunter, of Lincoln, Nebr., as “the 
redirection and adaptation of our course of study to our varied com- 
munity life.” 
Hygiene.—Decided progress is shown in reports in the matter of 
health supervision and the general mention of the school nurse and 
the dental clinic. The fresh-air room and the open-air school, too, 
are frequently mentioned. The school physician has become far 
more than a mere inspector, and the nurse and the dentist are equally 
important factors in a well-organized scheme of health supervision 
in city schools. The dentist is the last to be employed wholly at 
public expense. Usually the dental clinic is managed on a cooperative 
basis, the dental service being rendered by volunteers. Only about 
a dozen cities report the installation of health supervision within the 
year. In most other instances it is spoken of, if at all, as having 
been established for a considerable time. 
A new system of ventilation is finding favor in Rockford, Ill. The 
system utilizes the usual mechanical devices, such as steam heating, 
fans, ducts, and temperature control, but differs in the manner of 
applying the heating agency in the room. It reverses the usual 
practice by providing a warm stratum of air at the ceiling to take up 
the heat loss of a room and supplying air at a lower temperature for 
ventilation below the stratum of warm air. This heavier air directed 
over the area of the room descends to the floor and exits. The air 
being admitted at about the right temperature for use retains the 
greater part of the natural out-door humidity. Lateral air move- 
ment, that is, from one person to another, is avoided, the supply to 
each person coming from above. If in Rockford a way has been 
found to preserve the natural humidity of air for schoolroom use, that 
has been found which many have been seeking in vain. 
Improvement of teachers.—Fort Worth and El Paso, Tex.; Oakland, 
Cal.; Youngstown, Ohio; Lincoln, Nebr.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; 
Rockford and Danville, Ill; Harrisburg, Pa.; and Stamford, Conn.,
-P-A-G-E-95
  SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 57 
mention new means employed to train teachers or to provide for the 
professional improvement of those in service as one of the important 
steps in advance made recently. Detroit encourages the study of 
problems under the direction of its newly organized department of 
educational research. Oakland, through a similar bureau and in 
cooperation with the University of California and Stanford University, 
is organizing research clubs for city teachers and principals. Uni- 
versity seniors enrolled in the school of education are allowed to 
register for research work in the city schools. The merit basis for 
salary adjustment is fast superseding the uniform salary schedule and 
the schedule based on experience alone. A school system which has 
just begun to train teachers for its service, and which for a time must 
have the greater part of the instruction given by the untrained, has 
a peculiarly difficult problem to solve in making a just salary schedule, 
and one which at the same time stimulates professional improvement 
in the teaching force. Following is a description of a salary card 
devised by Supt. R. G. Jones and used in Rockford, Ill., to meet such 
a situation. It is the only formal rating system observed by the 
writer in the reports of the current year. 
On each card are listed all the teachers of a school with the following data concerning 
each teacher: (1) Credits for experience; (2) credits for training; (3) credits for effi- 
ciency; (4) the salary estimated from these credits; (5) the present salary; (6) the 
increase of estimated salary over present salary. 
CREDITS, 
The possible number of credits for any teacher is 160. The credits are distributed 
in the following way: Experience, 62; training, 18; efficiency, 80; total, 160, 
EXPERIENCE. 
A teacher’s experience credits are determined as follows: 
One year’s experience, 20 credits, 
Two years’ experience, 20 plus 16, or 36 credits. 
Three years’ experience, 20 plus 16 plus 12, or 48 credits. 
Four years’ experience, 20 plus 16 plus 12 plus 8, or 56 credits, 
Five years’ experience, 20 plus 16 plus 12 plus 8 plus 4, or 60 credits. 
Six years’ experience, 20 plus 16 plus 12 plus 8 plus 4 plus 2, or 62 credits. 
TRAINING. 
One credit is allowed for four weeks of college or normal training. Credit is also 
allowed for private training in instances where it aids in the special work of the teacher. 
EFFICIENCY. 
Grading of efficiency is based on the combined judgments of principals, supervisors, 
the superintendent, and members of the teachers’ committee of the board of education. 
It takes into consideration instructional skill, initiative, cooperation, intellectual 
capacity, etc. 
SALARY. 
Each credit represents 50 cents in salary. Eighty dollars is the maximum salary. 
A teacher’s salary is equal to half the number of her combined credits in experience, 
training, and efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-96
  58 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
REMARKS. , 
The distribution of credits between experience, training, and efficiency should be 
varied from time to time to suit the conditions in the system. For instance, the large 
proportion of credits given to experience in this particular system is due to the fact 
that training has not been emphasized among requirements for teachers, with the result 
that there is a surplus of experience, and small training. Consequently the salary 
must be based for a time at least more largely on experience, to avoid too radical a 
change of salaries. 
It is interesting to score the teachers on these items and compare the estimated 
salaries with the actual salary. 
It has disclosed the following facts: 
1. Teachers’ salaries have been based on the number of years they have taught in 
the system. 
2. The efficiency and training have had no definit relation to salaries. 
Below is given a representative card showing the ratings of one of the schools in the 
system:

Length of school day—The tendency toward lengthening the school 
day, noted in only a few instances last year, is apparently on the 
increase. This year seven cities mention the lengthened day in high 
school. These cities are Auburn and Syracuse, N. Y.; Duluth, 
Minn.; Clinton, Iowa; Norristown, Pa.; Ogden, Utah; and Spokane, 
Wash. In Holyoke and Springfield, Mass., the matter is under con- 
sideration. No public expression of disapproval of the longer day is 
reported except in Syracuse, where some temporary misunderstand- 
ing was soon put at rest.

SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE LARGER CITIES. 59 
The double-session plan in Ogden, with optional substitution of 
approved outside practical work for either the forenoon or afternoon 
session, has already been mentioned. Of 128 representative high 
schools throughout the country, 11 have a six-hour day according to 
arecent inquiry. The extended session in Auburn is in part for vol- 
untary work and only in part compulsory. The Norristown, Pa., 
report makes the following statement: 
THE EXTENDED SESSION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL. 
The school opens at 8.45 and closes at 3.30. There is an intermission of 30 minutes 
at 12o’clock. The periods are 1 hour in length. The last half of the period is devoted 
to recitation. The first half of the period is devoted to study, under the direction of 
the teacher who has charge of the recitation. During this portion of the period the 
teacher does not use the time for marking papers or to prepare herself to teach the 
lesson. She devotes the entire time to the quiet supervision and direction of the 
study by the pupils. 
When the class has a laboratory period, a typewriting period, a manual-training 
period, a drawing period, or a domestic-art period, the entire hour is devoted to the 
particular type of work. 
Pupils who carry the minimum requirements will have one full period for study 
each day, in addition to the half-hour preparation prior-to each lesson. Twice a week. 
they will have two hours, in addition to the half-hour preparation prior to each lesson. 
Pupils who are strong enough to carry an additional subject will have a full hour for 
study twice a week only. 
Pupils are allowed to carry an extra subject only by the request of the parents and 
the consent of the principal and superintendent. 
Pupils who can not gain a good standing in their lessons by using all the available 
time for study in school are urged to supplement school periods for study by study at 
home until a satisfactory standing is attained. 
The benefits which are expected to be derived from the above plan are the following: - 
1. An opportunity to teach the student how to study. 
2. It places the work of the school where it ought to be, under the direction of the 
person particularly fitted, the teacher, to direct it. The work will be done in the 
place particularly fitted for study, the school plant. 
8. One-half hour for study, followed by one-half hour for recitation, avoids fatigue 
and at the same time places the student under the teacher’s influence 1 hour instead 
of 45 minutes. 
4, The work will be done in daytime. 
5. The pupil will gain time. At present much time is wasted in study because the 
pupil frequently studies under conditions that are not favorable. He frequently 
does not know how to approach his work and becomes discouraged and loses time. 
6. It avoids the fatigue that comes from night study. 
7. It reduces the amount of eyestrain due to night study. 
8. It insures some preparation by every pupil. This will make the teaching more 
effective. When pupils are expected to prepare their lessons at home many fail to 
do so. 
9. The evening belongs to the home, not to the school. Itis the time for the family 
hour, for social culture, and for legitimate entertainment. It is the time for relaxa- 
tion and the time when the mind should be diverted from the business of the day. 
It will mean greater companionship of parents and children during the high-school 
period. 
10. This plan recognizes the value of a rhythmic life—a time for work, a time for 
relaxation and recreation, a time for sleep.

  60 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The all-year school—Summer sessions of four to six weeks in ele- 
mentary and even high schools have become so numerous as to make 
an enumeration of the cities in which they are conducted impracti- 
cable. In most instances these sessions are for review, so that pupils 
who have failed of promotion may regain their lost grade, but in 
many instances they are so conducted as to allow pupils to gain a 
grade. Newark, N.J., still furnishes the only example of the all-year 
elementary school, though Grand Rapids, Norristown, and Utica 
are considering its adoption, the latter in a single school where 99 
per cent of the children are of foreign extraction. In Newark one of 
the two all-year schools is composed almost entirely of Italian pupils 
and the other of Jewish pupils. The Newark report asks and answers 
three questions: (1) Does continuance at school injure the health of 
the children? (2) Can the plan be administered successfully? (3) 
Is the expense of maintaining the school two extra months justified ? 
The principals of both schools report that the health of the children 
has been exceptionally good. ‘The difficulties that have been expe- 
rienced in administering the plan have been easily met. The plan 
is held to be economicel for the following reasons: 
Plant.—Owing to the more rapid progress of pupils, a plant of a given size will 
accommodate a larger number of pupils in a given number of years. 
Instruction.—Inasmach as the elementary course is completed in 6 years instead 
of 8 years, there is a saving in the cost of instruction. This saving represents the 
difference in cost between maintaining the schools for 6 summers of 8 weeks each, as 
compared with 2 full years of 40 weeks each. 
Maintenance.—Just as the initial cost of providing grounds and buildings will be 
lessened by making fewer schools necessary to accommodate the city’s needs, all 
elements of cost involved in maintenance of the school plant will be correspondingly 
diminished. Stated in brief, the more efficient utilization of the school plant and 
school machinery in the way proposed will largely diminish the element of cost, 
while at the same time adding substantially to the output. 
Other features that find frequent mention in the year’s reports are: 
Cooperation with the social forces of the community; provision for 
exceptional children; less reliance on examinations as tests for pro- 
motion; vocational guidance; profitable use of study period; evening 
school; continuation school, day and evening; nurse as home visitor; 
organized play; social and recreative centers; school savings; semi- 
annual promotions. The teaching of sex hygiene, a topic so much 
discussed recently in conventions, is mentioned in only 2 of the 200 
reports available for study. Of all these topics here mentioned the 
one most generally treated in the reports is that relating to the wider 
use of the school plant.

INTRODUCTION. 
Since this is the first attempt of the Bureau of Education to make 
a survey of educational progress exclusively for cities of 25,000 popu- 
lation and less, much space must necessarily be devoted to conditions 
as they exist at the present time in the schools of this group of cities 
without immediate regard to the year under consideration. By dis- 
covering what conditions are, a general idea will be had of recent 
progress and present tendencies, and a starting point will also be 
established, so that future articles relating to educational progress in 
the smaller cities may show more definitely just what advancement 
these cities have made. 
That the smaller cities need to be considered in any survey of con- 
ditions in city schools is evident from the following: There are only 
229 cities of more than 25,000 population, while there are 2,173 of 
between 2,500 and 25,000 population; of the 42,623,383 people who 
live in cities, 14,079,567, or one-third of the total urban population, 
live in the smaller cities. This group of cities shows as rapid increase 
in population as the other groups. From 1900 to 1910 the per cent 
of increase in cities of over 100,000 was 32.8; in cities from 25,000 to 
100,000 it was 37.9, and in cities from 2,500 to 25,000 it was 36.1. 
In school enrollment and school expenditure the smaller cities 
present rather significant conditions. The total enrollment in city 
schools for the year 1913 was 6,370,023; of this number, 1,878,713 were 
in cities of between 5,000 and 25,000 population; 1,361,843 in cities 
between 25,000 and 100,000, and 3,129,467 in cities above 100,000. 
All the cities of more than 25,000 reported enrollment statistics to 
this bureau, while 86 of those between 5,000 and 25,000 did not. — 
If these 86 cities and all under 5,000 had reported, the approximate 
61
-P-A-G-E-100
62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
enrollment in cities between 2,500 and 25,000 would be 2,500,000, 
or one-third of the total enrollment in all city schools. The total 
expense for instruction and maintenance in all cities was $199,264,299, 
of which $40,240,059 was for the cities between 5,000 and 25,000; 
$40,643,345 for those between 25,000 and 100,000, and $118,380,895 
for those over 100,000. All but two of the larger cities reported 
regarding these expenditures; 200 of those between 5,000 and 25,000 
did not report, and none of those from 2,500 to 5,000. If statistics 
were available from all these, the total expenses for the smaller cities 
would be at least $60,000,000, or from one-fourth to one-third of the 
total amount expended for instruction and maintenance of city 
schools. The amount expended in 1912-13 for new buildings, equip- 
ment, and other indebtedness was $48,641,380; of the total amount, 
$10,447,588 was expended in the group of cities between 25,000 and 
100,000; $29,318,344 for those of more than 100,000, and approxi- 
mately $12,000,000 for the smaller cities, or about one-fourth of the 
total expenditure for new buildings and equipment. 
The number of teachers reported employed in city schools was 
164,877; of this number, 51,802 were in cities between 5,000 and 
25,000, and, approximately, at least 60,000 were employed in those 
between 2,500 and 25,000. The number of supervising officers in 
all cities over 5,000, not including building principals, was 3,649, of 
whom 1,950 were in cities between 5,000 and 25,000. If one super- 
visor is added for each of the cities between 2,500 and 5,000, the 
total number of supervisors will be 3,200. There is thus approxi- 
mately one supervising officer, not including building principals, for 
each 1,200 pupils in the smaller cities and one for each 2,600 pupils 
in the larger cities. 
It is evident, therefore, that any discussion of progress in urban 
education must consider the progress made in the smaller city schools. 
Certain movements in education may not be so widespread as is 
popularly supposed when all towns and cities above 2,500 population 
are taken into consideration. For instance, there is much said of 
vocational training in city schools, yet investigations show that in 
the smaller cities this movement has progressed but little. To 
measure the real progress of the smaller schools, one should note to 
what extent they are turning out a better product. Often too many 
lines of endeavor do not denote progress, especially in a school system 
whose budget is limited. No doubt some of the best schools in the 
country are those that are doing one or two things well, rather than 
those that are, on a small appropriation, attempting many things. 
What is true educationally of one city of more than 25,000 popula- 
tion is likely to be true of most other cities of the same size. In the 
smaller cities, on the contrary, there is wide variation. To illus- 
trate: In one State there are two towns of 4,000 population each, a 
street forming the dividing line. There are large manufacturing
-P-A-G-E-101
  
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 63 
plants in the one town, and many of the citizens are highly paid 
superintendents, bosses, and skilled workmen. The tax rate for 
school purposes is only 3 or 4 mills on the dollar. In this city the 
school superintendent receives a good salary, and the teachers are 
efficient and well paid. On the whole, the schools are above the 
average for cities of the same size. The population of the other 
town is made up largely of unskilled laborers who live in cheaply 
constructed houses. The school tax rate is 15 or 16 mills; yet with 
this high rate the schools are less efficient, since the higher rate pro- 
duces less revenue than the lower one in the wealthier town. 
Similar instances are not uncommon. Many of the smaller cities are 
adjacent to a large city; one may be a wealthy suburb that can main- 
tain better schools than the large city itself, while other suburbs of 
the same city may be so poor that their schools are very inferior. A 
small city remote from the metropolitan district may be a manufactur- 
ing center with large mills, railroad shops, etc., able to maintain much 
better schools than cities that are mere trading points for an agricul- 
tural region or residential centers for retired business men or farmers 
whose wealth is often invested in other cities and in farms. In one 
small city of 12,000 population there are 25 millionaires, yet the 
assessed valuation of the city is only $10,000,000. The only property 
these men own in that city is their homes, their money being invested 
in mines in a neighboring State. If the statistics in this chapter 
showing conditions in the smaller cities are not as flattering as might 
be wished, it must be remembered that financial conditions are in 
many cases responsible for the lack of progress. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
Relatively few changes have been made within the Jast few years 
in the smaller cities in the size of school boards, length of term, and 
manner of election. The tendency has been, however, toward 
smaller boards, longer terms, and election at large. In 1911 Pennsyl- 
vania reduced the number of members of school boards in nearly 
every city and borough, the ward system of election giving way to 
election at large. Some of the cities of less than 25,000 population 
had as many as 21 members. All cities in that State between 5,000 
and 30,000 now have boards composed of seven members, and all 
of 5,000 and less have boards of five members. The general verdict 
is that the change has rendered the school boards more efficient. 
Much that was formerly done by committees is now disposed of in 
open board meetings. In only one or two instances is it reported 
that election at large has secured a less satisfactory class of men. 
Statistics collected by this bureau show that of 1,272 cities report- 
ing, the board members are elected by popular vote in 1,087; in 44 
they are appointed by the mayor; and in 141 by the city council. 
In 951 cities they are elected for the entire city. In several States 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  64 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the boards are elected at large, but the members represent their 
respective wards. The ward system of election has been universally 
condemned and will no doubt soon pass away. 
In cities of between 2,500 and 30,000 population the number 
of board members varies from 3 to 24, most boards being composed 
of from 5 to 7 members. Of 1,271 of these cities reporting, 179 
have boards of 3 members; 4 of 4 members; 365 of 5; 236 of 6; 306 
of 7; 27 of 8; 97 of 9; 20 of 10; 8 of 11; 19 of 12; 3 of 13; 2 of 14; 2 
of 15; 1 of 16; 1 of 19; 1 of 24. Only 181 have more than 7 members. 
The tendency is toward fewer committees, though some boards 
still have as many committees as there are board members, so that 
each member may have a chairmanship. In cities where there are 
three board members, there are usually no committees. Boards 
composed of five members usually have two or three committees. 
Most cities elect for a term of three years. Of 1,224 cities of 
between 2,500 and 30,000 population reporting, 4 elect for a term 
of one year, 115 for two years, 714 for three years, 157 for four years, 
50 for five years, 192 for six years, and 2 for seven years. There is 
a tendency to increase the term of school board members, Pennsyl- 
vania having increased the term from three to six years and New 
Mexico from two to four years. 
In the smaller cities, especially those below 15,000 and 20,000, 
the business management of the schools is conducted by the board 
and the superintendent. In some of the cities of between 15,000 
and 25,000 population a secretary devotes all his time to the schools 
and acts as business agent for the board. There is undoubtedly 
room for improvement in the management of the business affairs of 
the schools in the smaller cities; of 1,350 cities reporting to the 
bureau, only 250 are keeping accounts in accordance with the forms 
recommended by the Department of Superintendence of the National 
Education Association. 
CITY SUPERINTENDENTS.’ 
The office of city superintendent is of comparatively recent origin.? 
Not until 1883 was there a superintendent of schools in Philadelphia, 
Pa. Now every town and city of over 2,500 population has a super- 
intendent or supervising principal who devotes all or part of his time 
to problems of supervision and administration. In a few other cities 
the superintendent does not have the same authority over the high 
school that he does over the grades; in 125 of the cities reporting, 
superintendents have no control over the high school. Before school 
boards fully understood the function of a superintendent, he was 
required to teach all or part of the time. Conditions have so im-   
1In this chapter the term “city superintendents” includes all heads of a city school system, whether 
legally empowered as superintendents or only as supervising principals. 
2'The exact date is in dispute; see Education Bulletin, 1913, No. 8, p. 50, note.
-P-A-G-E-103
  
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 65 
proved in the smaller cities that of 1,300 superintendents reporting, 
only 319 are required to do any teaching. 
It has taken school boards some years to realize that the only 
logical person to nominate and select teachers is the superintendent. 
Of 1,300 cities reporting, the superintendent nominates teachers in 
955; in 501 cities he sometimes selects them. In only 205. cities, 
however, are superintendents permitted to dismiss employees. In 
955 cities books are adopted upon the recommendation of the super- 
intendent; in 854 he recommends changes in salaries. It might be 
supposed that all superintendents attend board meetings, but 75 
report that they attend only when invited. 
As yet few State laws define specifically the powers and duties 
of city superintendents. In several States the superintendent has 
a seat on the board, but no vote. In only a few States does the law 
give him the power to recommend the appointment and dismissal 
of teachers. Whatever power a superintendent in any city has is 
usually delegated to him by the school board. 
On the whole, the power of the superintendent in the smaller cities 
is increasing. In reply to a questionnaire to which 756 superinten- 
dents responded, 614 say that their boards are inclined to give them 
more power. The following rules recently adopted at Long Beach, 
Cal., indicate the trend of opinion as to the powers and duties of the 
superintendent: 
1. The superintendent of schools shall be the chief executive officer of the board of 
education and shall have general coordinating authority and oversight over the work 
of all executive officers and employees of the school district, 
2. He shall prepare and recommend to the board for adoption the courses of study 
for the elementary schools, and any changes that he may from time to time deem 
advisable. 3. He shall select and recommend suitable textbooks (other than State 
books) and supplementary books for the elementary schools. No book shall be 
selected by the board which is not recommended by the superintendent. 
4, He shall recommend suitable principals, special supervisors, and teachers for the 
elementary schools. No principal, special supervisor, or teacher shall be elected by 
the board who is not recommended by the superintendent. 
5. He shall have full responsibility for the promotion, assignment, and transfer of 
principals, special supervisors, and teachers. He shall submit to the board full infor- 
mation relating to these matters. 
6. He shall be responsible for the general efficiency of the school system, for the 
development of the teaching force, and for the growth and welfare of the pupils. 
7. He shall be responsible for all rules and regulations governing the admission 
transfer, classification, and promotion of pupils. 
8. He shall prepare, distribute, and collect all blanks and reports required by law 
and such other blanks and reports as he shall deem necessary for the intelligent and 
systematic conduct of the schools. 
9. Jointly with the principal of the high school he shall recommend to the board 
courses of study, textbooks, and teachers for the high school. No textbook shall be 
adopted, or teacher elected, that has not been jointly recommended by the superin- 
tendent and high-school principal. 
10. He shall monthly and annually make reports to the board relative to conditions 
in the schools and recommendations for their increased efficiency. 
73226°—xp 1914—vor 1—_5 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
    66 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
11. At least once each term he shall report to the board upon the general condition 
of the teaching and supervisory forces, and especially with reference to those teach- 
ers or supervisors whose services are not proving satisfactory. 
12. He shall be responsible for the methods of instruction and management used by 
the teachers and principals, and shall have authority to hold such meetings of teachers 
and principals as he deems necessary for their instruction and guidance. 
13. He shall have power to suspend from school any pupil whose conduct or char- 
acter is such as to injure the reputation of the school, or whose parents wilfully neglect 
or refuse to cooperate with the superintendent or teacher in carrying out the regula- 
tions of the school, or encourage their children to violate the regulations, and report 
his action to the board of education. 
At present 578 of the 1,350 cities reporting require their superin- 
tendents to be college graduates; many others, in the absence of any 
formal rule of the board, always employ college graduates. The 
educational qualifications of the superintendent as defined by State 
law are usually that he shall hold a first-grade or life certificate and 
have a few years’ experience as a teacher. Experience has shown, 
however, that a superintendent must have other qualifications. In 
the past the ability to administer schools was acquired by experience 
alone; to-day there is a demand for men who have had special train- - 
ing in the several phases of school administration. 
Much of the business management must fall upon the superinten- 
dent, since it is impossible to separate business and educational 
administration completely. In most schools about half the money 
expended is for instruction. A business manager may know more 
than the superintendent about purchasing janitor supplies and 
repairing buildings economically, but neither he nor any school board 
member knows what instruction to buy, how much, and in what sub- 
jects, how many pupils to be assigned a teacher, how many supervisors 
to be employed, how many daily recitations a high-school teacher 
should conduct, and how many hours of work a high-school pupil 
should carry. It is therefore evident that a superintendent can not 
be totally oblivious to the financial phase of his work, or he will bring 
his board to bankruptcy; or, as only so much money is available for 
the schools in any city, he will not secure the best educational results 
from the funds expended. 
One of the signs of progress in the smaller cities is that many of the 
superintendents are taking postgraduate courses in methods of teach- 
ing and in school administration. The summer school classes in 
school administration in many of the colleges are made up largely 
of these men, and some of the most interesting and instructive 
studies in administrative problems have been made by superintend- 
ents in the smaller cities. A few years ago the published reports 
of the schools of these cities contained nothing but lists of teachers and 
high-school graduates, with a few tables relating to expenditures; 
to-day some of these reports present school conditions as scientifically 
as those issued by many of the larger cities.

  SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 67 
LENGTH OF SERVICE. 
One of the reasons the schools in the smaller cities have not become 
more efficient is that superintendents remain in one position for such 
short periods. During the two years from 1911 to 1913, in cities 
between 4,000 and 25,000, there were 348 changes, an average of 174, 
or 13 per cent a year. If statistics were available for towns of 
between 2,500 and 4,000 population, the percentage would be much 
greater. A short term is responsible for frequent changes. By 
referring to Table 1, below, it will be seen that most superintendents 
are elected for a term of only one year. Few superintendents remain 
in one city more than ten years.

The tendency, however, is undoubtedly toward a longer term. 
During the two years 1911-1913, in 83 cities the length of term of 
the superintendents was increased. The new school code of Pennsyl- 
vania provides that city superintendents shall be elected for a term 
of four years. In several of the States, notably New Jersey, New 
York, and Massachusetts, many of the superintendents are given 
indefinite terms. SALARIES. 
Another cause for the many changes is that salaries are low, 
especially in the group of cities under 10,000, the average for those 
between 4,000 and 10,000 being $1,889. The following presents the 
range of salaries paid in cities of this group:

There is a hopeful increase in superintendents’ salaries in the 
smaller cities. During the two years 1911-1913, the salaries of the 
superintendents in 569 cities were increased, the minimum increase 
being $5 and the maximum $2,400. An increase of more than $1,000 
was made in several instances in California, Georgia, Indiana, Hlinois, 
Maine, and Minnesota. During the same period, 87 cities decreased 
the salaries of their superintendents, the decreases ranging from $10 
to $950. Most of these decreases were made when a new superin- 
tendent was elected; thus, in one instance, when a superintendent 
receiving $2,700 a year resigned, a successor was elected at $2,200.

elementary teachers to be normal-school graduates; 630 require only 
a high-school education; the remainder fail to specify what qualifica-

Of the 1,350 cities reporting, 907 require high-school teachers to be 
college graduates; 709 employ college graduates without experience.

SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 71 
In reply to a more recent inquiry, 360 say that during the past year 
they have demanded additional educational and professional prep- 
aration. 
One means of improving teachers has not received the attention it 
should—a salary schedule based upon qualifications and efficiency, 
rather than upon experience. Promotion on experience alone does 
not always reward the teachers who are making the most improve- 
ment, and does not always tend to call forth the best effort on the 
part of teachers. It may, however, help retain teachers in service 
for a greater number of years, and should, up to a certain point, be a 
factor in salary schedules. Advanced education and professional 
training are often not rewarded. It has been said that in formal 
salary schedules the premiums usually given are too low for education 
and too high, relatively, for experience in teaching. The tendency at 
present, however, is strongly toward schedules based upon experience, 
education, training, and success, with the teachers grouped into three 
or four classes. 
Nearly all superintendents who are promoting largely on education 
and efficiency testify to the practical value of such schedules. The 
superintendent of schools at Owensboro, Ky., says: 
One of the far-reaching movements of the past year was the organization of the sys- 
tem for the employment and promotion of teachers and fixing their salaries. The new 
schedule, which classifies teachers according to experience, preparation, and success, 
rather than upon experience alone, is having the effect of arousing teachers to the 
necessity of making professional preparation for the responsible work they have to do. 
Never before in the history of the schools have so many teachers attended summer 
schools, colleges, and universities. More teachers’ periodicals are being read than 
ever before, and teachers are taking every advantage to improve themselves in the 
technique of their profession. 
The following rules regarding the promotion of teachers on merit 
are typical: 
Houghton, Mich.—Teachers are classified into A, B, and C grades. The superintend- 
ent ranks them, C below 75, B 75-90, A 90-100. Anyone who ranks C for the period of 
one year is not retained in the service; teachers ranking A and B receive the regular 
increase until the first maximum is reached. They remain at this salary for one year, 
during which, if their grade is A, they are permitted to participate in an annual increase 
until the final maximum is reached. 
Ottumwa, Jowa.—Teachers are divided into three groups, A, B, and C, on the basis 
of their efficiency. Those ranking A receive $5 a month increase each year until they 
reach the maximum of their grade. Those ranking B receive an advance of $2.50 a 
month increase each year until the maximum of their grade is reached. Those rank- 
ing C may be elected without an increase of salary. 
Astoria, Oreg. —A teacher may be given a double or triple increase at the end of the 
year upon recommendation of the superintendent. 
Freeport, Long Island, N. Y.—The matter of salary increase is based upon merit 
and efficiency. Teachers are formally rated by the superintendent twice each year. 
Cripple Creek, Colo.—The salary schedule provides for progressive classification for 
each succeeding year until the maximum is reached. <A teacher may advance one 
more class each, year or she may remain more than one year in the same class. A
-P-A-G-E-110
  72 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
teacher may also be demoted to a lower class if her work does not show continued 
interest and improvement. 
Bristol, Va.—After a teacher has entered the system she is sure of an annual advance- 
ment until a maximum is reached, provided she makes a success grade of 90. All 
teachers must attend a summer school at least once every five years. 
Beaver Falls, Pa.—No teacher is advanced in salary after she has ceased to advance 
in efficiency and successful experience; and fitness for increase is based upon an 
efficiency record kept by the superintendent. A definite statement showing wherein 
a teacher fails to meet the requirements is furnished to each teacher who is not given 
the increase in salary provided by the schedule. 
Dayton, Ky.—Teachers are awarded an increase in salary for attendance at summer 
school. 
Moline, Ill.—Teachers drawing a schedule salary for the third year are granted $5 
a month increase upon presentation of satisfactory evidence of summer-school work or 
extended travel. 
MEASURING THE EFFICIENCY OF A TEACHER OR A SCHOOL. 
A few years ago, if a superintendent of schools had been asked how 
he measured the efficiency of his schools or of his teachers, he would 
have answered only in the vaguest of terms, usually saying that the 
eighth-grade pupils had been well prepared for high school and that 
the high-school pupils in college were doing creditable work. To-day 
many of the superintendents in the smaller cities are attempting to 
judge the efficiency of their schools by other and more reliable 
standards. Although only a beginning has been made, i results 
as reported are uniformly encouraging. 
One of the ways of judging the work of a school is by means of 
standardized tests, such as the Courtis tests in arithmetic, the Thorn- 
dike and Ayres test for measuring the quality of handwriting, the 
Hillegas and Rice scales for measuring English composition. Of 756 
cities reporting, 389 are making use of standardized tests for testing 
teaching efficiency. The following extract from a letter by D. C. Bliss, 
superintendent of schools at Montclair, N. J., is typical of many 
received at this bureau regarding the measuring of efficiency: 
It may be stated, with little fear of contradiction, that no system of testing which 
can be devised can ever take the place of the superintendent’s personal and frequent 
visits to the classrooms of the teachers under his care. The most elastic test becomes 
arbitrary unless there is some knowledge on the part of the examiner of the difficulties 
with which the teacheriscontending. * * * 
To support the superintendent’s personal opinion, however, there may well be 
documentary evidence of a teacher’s success or failure. This comes wholly from the 
progress of the class, for the demand is not for a knowledge of psychological theory, 
but for the power to achieve results. At the beginning of the year the class should be 
tested in one or two fundamental subjects, such as English or practical arithmetic, 
with the purpose of determining its measure of attainment at the time the new teacher 
for the year assumes charge. This gives a standard for comparison. Whether the 
class improves upon this standard or falls below it as the months go on, the responsi- 
bility for the success or failure belongs to its present teacher. It is not necessary to 
test in all subjects. It is generally safe to assume that a teacher who is doing good, 
solid work in the few subjects most needed by pupils who are going out into a world of   
-P-A-G-E-111
  
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 73 
practical living is the kind of teacher who carries her faithfulness and ability into all 
departments of her work. Unless the superintendent sees from his visits to the room 
that things are going radically wrong, a class need not be tested frequently. Ordi- 
narily, a test at the beginning of the year, one at the end, and one at some time during 
the intervening months will be sufficient. 
Testing for efliciency does not imply a long, formal examination of the old-fashioned 
type, with the results marked in per cents and a teacher’s ability estimated by the 
place her class attains in the scale for the whole city. With the varying personnel and 
environment of the different classes, such an estimate is manifestly grossly unfair to 
the teacher. The fairer way is to use the standardization methods employed by 
Dr. J. M. Rice, Dr. Thorndike, or Mr. Courtis, establishing from the results obtained 
all over the city an average standard for that city, to the attainment of which a class, 
and through the class the teacher, may rightly be held. In this way the teacher’s 
work is judged on its own merits above or below the established standard, not by 
comparison with the work of another teacher in a school in which the conditions may 
be many times easier than those she has to contend with. 
In one instance, at least, a grammar-grade supervisor has worked 
out a standard test in English from the composition of the pupils 
under her supervision. Miss Gertrude Earhart, supervisor of gram- 
mar grades at Boise, Idaho, who has formulated such a scale, says: 
In an attempt to standardize the work in composition in the grammar grades, the 
“Villegas scale for measuring composition’ was first used. As the use of any language 
scale was new to us, we were somewhat inept in evaluating the work of our pupils, 
particularly the younger grades, according to this scale: In the hope of helping the 
teachers to something more definite, a language scale from the compositions of our 
own pupils was made. A composition from each pupil in the fifth, sixth, seventh, 
and eighth grades of our schools was read and placed in one of several groups. After 
all the papers were classified in groups for each grade, the groups for the sixth grade 
were ranked beside the fifth-grade groups. As would be expected, the lowest group 
of sixth-grade papers was better than the lowest group of fifth-grade papers, and the 
best group of sixth-grade papers ranked above the best fifth-grade papers. The 
seventh-grade papers were ranked beside the sixth, and the eighth beside the seventh 
in the same manner, each grade ranking higher at both the lower and upper end of the 
scale than the grade a year behind it. The distribution of compositions for each year 
followed the normal curve of distribution. 
This attempt to make a continuous scale which would cover work from the beginning 
of the fifth to the end of the eighth year was unsatisfactory, however, as it was hard 
to balance so much skill in form, punctuation, etc., in a fifth-grade reproduction 
exercise, as worth so much thought, facility in expression, etc., in an original eighth- 
grade exercise, so the idea of using a continuous scale for the four grades was aban- 
doned and a scale of six or seven groups was made for each grade. The lowest group 
for each grade was numbered 1, as we did not expect ever to have any lower classes; 
the second group, 2; and so on, so as to leave room for indefinite expansion at the 
upper end of the scale. These scales were then typed and put in the hands of each 
teacher, and she graded the papers of her class according to the scale. Once a month 
papers graded by the scale were collected, the results tabulated by building and by 
grade, and the tabulation given to the teachers. These results showed a marked. 
increase from month to month in the number of papers in the upper grades of the 
scale. This improvement was doubtless due in a great measure to clearer ideas in the 
teacher’s mind of what could be expected from her grade. 
That much of the work was accomplished last year, and this year we have gone a 
step further and have attempted to have the pupils of the sixth, seventh, and eighth 
   
-P-A-G-E-112
74 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
grades evaluate their own work according to the scale before it is handed to the 
teacher. The teacher then examines the paper and places her grade below that of 
the pupil. The pupils, contrary to all prediction, have shown very fair judgment 
in grading their own papers and have made great efforts to raise their grades. 
While the scales we use are open to criticism at numerous points and are unsatis- 
factory to us in certain respects, yet we feel that by their use we have been able to 
do more definite work in improving the quality of composition written by our pupils, 
and we have been able to differentiate the kind of work done in the grades, so that 
each grade has some definite things to accomplish. 
Practical schoolmen are, however, pretty well agreed that stand- 
ardized tests, valuable as they are, are but one means of testing 
teaching and a poor substitute for the observance of actual classroom 
work. Only recently have any attempts been made to set up well- 
defined standards for judging a teacher’s work, and as yet there is 
no agreement among schoolmen as to the points upon which a teacher 
should be graded or the relative value of these points. Among the 
standards that superintendents are using are those formulated by 
Dr. Frank McMurry in his “Report on the quality of classroom 
instruction in the New York City schools.’’! In the Ohio State sur- 
vey the bureau of municipal research used a card containing points 
on which teachers were judged. As this card is in use among some 
of the smaller schools, it is printed on the following page.   
1 See, for a critical view of these standards, the “ Reply of the district superintendents of New York to 
the report of the Hanus inquiry,” edited by J. S. Taylor, New York, 1914.

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Many superintendents, realizing that if a teacher is to be judged 
she must know to what standards she must attain to be considered 
successful, have formulated standards of their own for the guidance 
of their teachers. It is impossible to give examples of all the many 
standards in use, but the following are presented as showing that 
superintendents are earnestly striving to place the testing of teachers 
upon a more rational basis.

  PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATION. 
Ninety-four cities of the smaller group report a school survey 
within the last three years. Many of these cities, however, are in 
Ohio and other States that have had State-wide surveys. Again, 
others include surveys of retardation and elimination made by the 
superintendent and teachers. This bureau has no data showing just 
how many surveys have been made in cities of 25,000 population 
and less by committees composed of men from other school systems. 
In the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1913 a summary 
was given of the surveys made in six of the smaller cities, namely: 
Boise, Idaho, Montclair, N. J., East Orange, N. J., Greenwich, Conn., 
Cohassett, Mass., and Newburgh, N. Y. The following is a summary 
of the surveys made in the smaller cities not included in the list given 
in the chapter on city schools in. the commissioner’s report for 1913: 
Grafton, W. Va.—The board of education at Grafton, W. Va., a city of 8,000 popu- 
lation, not being satisfied that they were expending the school funds to the best
-P-A-G-E-118
  80 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
advantage, invited three practical school men of their own State to make a survey 
cf the schools of that city and to make a definite report regarding the needs of the 
schools and the best method of economizing on the funds available so as to provide 
for these needs. 
The committee, composed of Dr. J. N. Deahl, head of the department of education 
in the State university, Mr. Joseph Rosier, superintendent of schools, Fairmont, and 
Mr. Otis Wilson, superintendent of schools, Elkins, were asked to make the survey, 
and accepted on condition that their report should in no way affect the standing of 
the superintendent. The board assured these men that the superintendent was 
leaving, and that it was desired to have an investigation before the election of a new 
superintendent. 
The investigation covered the following points: Educational needs of the com- 
munity from an industrial standpoint, the professional training and equipment of the 
teachers employed, the course of study in use in the schools, the methods of teaching 
and the plan of school organization, methods of administration as related to the assign- 
ment of teachers, possible consolidation of departments and grades, current expendi- 
tures, the purchase of supplies, and high-school equipment. 
‘The committee made no attempt to discuss theories, but recommended among other 
things that a cooperative industrial course, similar to that at Fitchburg, Mass., be 
instituted; that night classes be formed for the boys and girls employed in the glass 
factories; that the present organization of the high-school work into four curricula 
should be made less restrictive; that the grades below the high school be reorganized 
so that the average enrollment for each teacher would be between 30 and 40 pupils 
and that the money saved be applied to the employment of instruction of manual 
training and domestic science; that the grade work could be improved by giving less 
time to the formal study of United States history, geography, physiology, and arith- 
metic, the time assigned for arithmetic being excessive. 
Ogden, Utah.—The schools of Ogden, Utah, being criticized by some of the citizens 
of that city, the board of education asked the faculty of the University of Utah and 
the United States Commissioner of Education to appoint a committee to investigate 
conditions in the schools of that city. The following committee was appointed: 
Charles S. Meek, superintendent of schools, Boise, Idaho; George A. Eaton, principal 
of the Salt Lake City high school; Edward J. Ward, extension lecturer of the Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin; W. G. Roylance, professor of sociology in the University of Utah; 
and W. S. Deffenbaugh, of the United States Bureau of Education. The committee, 
on account of the shortness of the time allowed for making the survey, divided their 
work, assigning to Messrs. Meek, Eaton, and Deffenbaugh the internal organization 
of the school and to Messrs. Ward and Roylance the social and civic relationship 
of the school and the community. The first-named gentlemen investigated those 
phases of school organization that had been most severely criticized, namely, the 
power granted the superintendent of appointing and dismissing employees, depart- 
mental teaching in the grammar grades, junior high schools, a free elective system in 
the high school, the course of study, the inability of the schools to keep pupils in 
school, character of the teaching, half-time plan as outlined by the superintendent for 
the seventh and eighth grades, and the method of supervision. 
The two other members of the committee discussed at length the systematic organ- 
ization of the political, economic, and recreational life of the people of the city. 
They recommended that the board of education be abolished and that the schools 
be placed under the direct management cf the city commission, saying in support of 
this recommendation: 
The various sorts of duties which are now handled by the school board without 
business-like division, such as would make the definite placing of responsibility 
ossible, may easily be distributed among the several commissioners on the precise 
es of their present division of responsibility. For instance, the finances of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES, 81 
public-school system would be taken care of by the department of finance of the 
city government and be under the supervision of the head of that department; the 
care of the school buildings and grounds would be looked after by the department 
of the city commission that has charge of pubbe property and be under the supervision 
of the head of that department; the work of truancy prevention, sanitary inspection 
and so on, would be included in the care of the department of public safety. 
It was recommended also that the present commission be increased from three to 
five members, two constituting the department of education. This part of the report 
also discussed and recommended the plan of part time in school and part time at 
work in shops, offices, etc. 
Nutley, N. J—The school board of Nutley authorized at its regular meeting Jan- 
uary 27, 1914, the superintendent of schools of that town to make a survey of the 
needs of the schools. Aided by the Bureau of Municipal Research of New York City, 
a thorough survey of school conditions was made and a report submitted to the board 
under four main heads: First, educational needs; second, geographical conditions 
and real estate development; third, a sociological study of the people served; and, 
fourth, recapitulations, deductions, and conclusions. It was recommended that the 
schools be organized into three groups and on the following plan: 
Group I. Kindergarten and grades 1 to 6, located in the residence section near the 
people. 
Group II. Grades 7 to 9 to be known as the junior high school and located in the 
geographic center of the town. 
Group III. Grades 10 to 12 to be known as the senior high school, located in the 
geographic center and about the civic center. 
The greater part of the report is confined to a discussion of buildings and further 
needs. 
Lawrence, Kans.—A social survey of the city of Lawrence has just been completed 
by Profs. F. W. Blackman and Ernest W. Buyers, of the department of sociology of 
the University of Kansas. The study includes city planning, municipal adminis- 
tration, industry, and trade, education, churches, recreation, delinquency, depend- 
ency, housing, public health, and sanitation. The survey exhibit was made October 
7, 8, and 9, 1914, in conjunction with the meeting of the Kansas League of Munici- 
palities, which met at Lawrence on those days. The aim of the committee in holding 
the exhibit was to direct the attention of the towns and cities to a more scientific 
method of community study and progress. 
Clarion, Pa.—The superintendent of schools at Clarion, Pa., and members of the 
faculty of the State Normal School located at that place made a survey of the Clarion 
schools for the purpose of discovering: First, what a majority of the pupils of the 
schools of Clarion do after leaving the various grades; second, why they quit school; 
third, why they went to other schools and finished their work there. The committee 
found that the boys generally did one of three things—worked in town as clerks, 
worked at manual labor, or took up some profession. From the standpoint of the 
school, it was found that two causes contributed largely to their withdrawal: First, 
the work of the school did not function in their daily life; second, the social part of 
the school life was much neglected, so much so that many pupils looked upon the 
school building as a prison. Many, therefore, went to other schools where they could 
get what they needed and where there was more attention given to the social side of 
school life. As a result of this survey, a night school was opened for boys and girls 
employed as clerks in stores and in offices. Because of the great number who leave 
school to work at manual labor, the school board introduced courses including sewing 
and manual training. The superintendent says: 
Because of work along the lines indicated by the survey, we have not had a pupil 
to leave the high school to go to the State Normal School (in Pennsylvania pupils 
often quit high school to attend normal schools). In two years the high school has 
grown from 29 to 89.

82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
However valuable a school survey by outside parties may be, a 
continual survey by the superintendent and his assistants is of definite 
worth to the school system. During the last few years many super- 
intendents have made valuable and interesting studies of retarda- 
tion in their respective schools; others have made careful analyses 
of unit cost in order to determine just how to use the money appro- 
priated most economically. Among the many interesting reports 
that indicate careful analysis of conditions to determine the efficiency 
of schools is the one just issued by the school board of Solvay, N. Y 
Realizing that the efficiency of the Solvay schools could not be 
measured by the preparation of children who passed the regents’ 
examination, or who had done well in college, the superintendent 
made an analysis of conditions to determine the efficiency of his 
school from a knowledge of the following facts: 
1. The percentage of retarded or overage pupils. 
2. The proportion of pupils who completed the elementary school. 
8. How many of these continued into the high school. 
4, What proportion of pupils who entered our school were graduated from high 
school. 
5. The ratio between the pupils above the compulsory age limit and those below it. 
6. The flexibility of the promotion interval. 
7. The money waste from unnecessary nonpromotion. 
8. The attention paid to backward and exceptionally bright children, 
9. The kind and amount of help given to non-English-speaking children. 
10. The ability of the children to spell, write, compute, and compose (the so- ecailen 
school arts), and to reason in arithmetic,‘geography, history, and practical science 
and arts. 
11. The attention given to the children’s health and recreation. 
12. The practical values of the courses of study judged from the standard of social 
values, 
13, The extent to which the instruction functioned at the pupils’ homes and in the 
outside world. 
14. Vocational guidance and the opportunities for vocational training. 
15. The diversity of educational opportunities to meet the naturally very diverse 
minds of 1,200 children. 
ORGANIZATION AND COURSE OF STUDY. 
REORGANIZATION. 
Although it is not possible to describe many of the plans of reor- 
ganization that have taken place among the schools of the smaller 
cities within the last year or two, the following examples of attempts 
to broaden the scope of the schools are interesting and undoubtedly 
indicate progress: 
Boise, Idaho.—Realizing that the high school of his city should be more closely 
related to the life of the community, the superintendent of schools at Boise has 
reorganized the high school of that city by introducing industrial studies and by 
requiring only the subject of English. Sixty-three units of work are offered, 16 units 
being required for graduation. Of the 63 units offered, 31 represent the newer school 
activities, and 32 the traditional subjects. The 31 units offered in the newer activities
-P-A-G-E-121
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 83 
in distinction from the traditional subjects consist. of 10 units of commercial studies, 
60 of agricultural, 6 of home economics, 20 of industrial art, 30 of shopwork in wood 
and concrete, and 4 of mechanical and architectural drafting. Since this reorganiza- 
tion the high-school enrollment has more than doubled, there being 400 students 
in the high school in 1910-11, while in 1913-14 there were 997 enrolled. During the 
period from 1910 to 1914, the enrollment in the elementary schools increased only 
19 per cent, which would indicate that the increased high-school enrollment was not 
occasioned by the growth of the city; nor can the growth of the school be attributed 
to an increase in the number of nonresident students. 
Reorganization in Boise has not made the traditional subjects any less popular 
in that city. In 1910 there were 1,600 pupils enrolled in the traditional subjects, 
allowing four enrollments for each of the 400 pupils. In 1914 there were 2,800 enroll- 
ments in the traditional subjects and 1,200 in the newer subjects, allowing 400 enroll- 
ments for each of the 1,000 students, 
To prevent pupils from “scattering” in electing their subjects, a sponsor system 
is provided; a teacher is selected as sponsor for a group of 25 pupils when they enter 
high school and she continues to act in this capacity for the same group for the entire 
four years, advising pupils with regard to the subjects they should pursue. 
Sewickley, Pa.—The superintendent of the Sewickley schools, after a visit to the 
schools of Gary, Ind., was convinced that he could not adopt all that he had seen at 
Gary, but that he could make use of the Gary idea of giving more time to play and 
industrial work. At that time there was no supervised play or industrial work in 
Sewickley. The question was how to introduce these without adding materially 
to the expense of instruction. A program was arranged whereby the regular classroom 
teachers were kept occupied while the students were in the manual-training depart- 
ment, domestic-science laboratory, or on the playground. The work is departmental- 
ized throughout the grades—that is, there are special teachers for music and drawing, 
language and literature, grammar and composition, physical training, history and 
civics, manual training and domestic science. The following is an outline of the 
general program which permits half the children to be under the regular classroom 
instructor and the other half under the special teachers, there being eight teachers 
for regular classroom work and eight for the special subjects previously enumerated:

A study of this program shows that while the B division of a grade is in regular class- 
room during the first 90-minute period, the A division is having work with the special 
teachers. The program is reversed for the second 90-minute period. The following 
program for the sixth grade illustrates the plan in detail:

By organizing the Sewickley schools on this plan the children in the first four grades 
have 412 minutes a week for play under the direction of a special playground instruc- 
tor, the fifth and sixth grades 135 minutes, and the seventh and eighth 112 minutes. 
The superintendent says: ‘‘This plan has been in operation two years and has proved 
successful from an educational and a financial point of view. The old plan, with the 
present additions to the program of work, would require a longer day and would be 
more expensive. ” 
Ardmore, Okla.—The superintendent of schools at Ardmore, Okla., has reorganized 
the elementary schools of that city into 24 terms of three months each, so that pupils 
may be promoted every three months. According to reports for that city, a pupil 
who has completed the work of any term is never required to repeat that work. Ifa 
pupil fails in one or two subjects, he is conditioned on these and allowed to pursue 
his work with his class. During four weeks of this time he reviews and does extra

and from 10.15 to 11.45 for 6B.

work on the subject in which he is conditioned. It is claimed that very rarely do 
pupils fail to make up work under this plan. Ifa pupil actually fails in his work and 
is not promoted, he fails on a very small unit and is not so discouraged as he would be 
if he had to take the entire year over. The plan contemplated is to give four of these 
12-week terms a year, with one week of vacation at the close of each term. This plan 
will enable a child to complete an eight-year course in six years. The results of the 
plan, which was put into operation only during the last year, are described by the 
superintendent as follows: 
During the past summer we had only 10 weeks of school, not compulsory but op- 
tional. We found that more pupils took the work than we anticipated. The teachers 
discovered that the children did better work than in winter. The forenoon was de- 
voted to classroom work and the afternoon to laboratory work, physical training, etc. 
The experience we have had so far encourages us to believe that it 1s going to be a very 
satisfactory method of organization. 
REORGANIZATION IN THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADES. 
One of the problems now before the schools is to reorganize the 
upper grammar grades so that they will articulate more closely with 
the high school. One of the-steps that many of the schools have 
taken is that of organizing the seventh and eighth grades on a depart- 
mental plan. Arguments for and against the plan are sufficiently 
familiar. In general the opinion of superintendents in the smaller 
city schools who have given the plan a trial is that their schools have 
become better, that there are fewer failures in the seventh and eighth 
grades and in the high school, and that there is a larger percentage of 
eighth-grade graduates entering high school. Some superintendents 
in the cities under consideration have definitely reorganized their 
school system on a ‘“‘six-and-six’”’ plan.! 
CREDIT FOR WORK OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL, 
How school life and home life may be more closely and definitely 
united is a question that many of the smaller cities are trying to solve 
by giving school credit for household, farm, or shopwork done at home. 
Another reason for giving credit for home work is that extensive 
industrial courses can not be offered in the smaller cities on account 
of the lack of funds. Many superintendents in the smaller towns and 
cities can not secure funds to introduce courses in manual training, 
cooking, sewing, music, etc.; 382 of these cities report that they do not 
have courses in industrial subjects because boards will not or can not 
appropriate the funds. 
Credit for home work in some of the smaller towns takes the place 
of regular courses in manual training and domestic science; while 
other cities, well equipped for teaching industrial subjects, give credit 
for work done outside of school, so that the children may work in part 
under real life situations and not entirely under artificial school con- 
ditions.

  86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Some schools give credit for almost any work done in the home, the 
parents grading the pupil, while other schools allow credit only for 
such work as can be supervised and standardized by the school 
authorities. : 
There are several plans for allowing credit. In high schools requir- 
ing 15 or 16 points for graduation, the usual plan is to allow a unit 
credit for definite home tasks. In the elementary schools a few points 
are added to a pupil’s grade in the industrial subjects or a half holiday 
is granted to a pupil after he has earned a certain number of credits. 
That the giving of credit for home duties can be made to help vital- 
ize school life is acknowledged, but school men are not yet agreed that 
credit should be offered for any work done in the home and that the 
parent alone should be the judge of the quality of the work. 
The home-credit course offered at Franklin, Ohio, is worthy of note: 
Home-Crepir Course, Franky, Onto. 
Credit may be given for work aside from that of the regular school hours, but done 
in correlation with the high school and under the direction of the superintendent of 
schools, in music, art, manual training, domestic science, agriculture, and commercial 
lines, as follows: 
1. In music and art, not to exceed a total of one-half credit or unit in any one year, 
and a total of not to exceed one unit in all four years. 
(a) Pupils playing in the high-school orchestra and whose work therein has been 
satisfactory shall be entitled to one-fourth credit each year, providing they have 
been present at 30 or more practice-meets of at least 40 minutes each and have played, 
if required, at public-school entertainments. Such credit will be given by the super- 
intendent of schools upon the recommendation of the public-school instructor in music. 
(0) Credits may be given for lessons in vocal or instrumental music under teachers of 
standard attainments, the time and number of lessons to be the same as in (a), and 
final credit obtained in same manner. 
(c) A credit of one-fourth unit may be given fora course of at least 36 lessons of at 
least 40 minutes each in art. Such course must develop free-hand drawing, but may 
include designing, painting, basketry, weaving, hammer, bead or leather work, clay 
modeling, or any of the various lines included under art in public schools in general. 
Credit for such work to be given by the superintendent after conference with the art 
teacher, if there be one. 
2. For any course that may reasonably take the place of manual training or domestic 
science as taught in the public school. 
A—FOR GIRLS, 
(a) A systematic course that shall include plain cooking, baking (bread, cake, and 
pastry), the proper care of the kitchen and utensils, and the proper setting and care 
of the table for meals. Such course should include the entire preparation of at least 
one meal a day for a definite period; the meal to have a reasonable variety from day 
today. The course should include in part at least the purchase of the food. 
(b) A systematic course in sewing that shall include plain sewing, patching, mend- 
ing, and darning; it must embrace the cutting and fitting of simpler garments and may 
include embroidery and fancy work. 
(c) The two preceding courses may be supplemented by systematic courses and train- 
ing in the general care of the house, as sweeping, dusting, and scrubbing, and the care 
of furniture; the care of the sick or of children; the care of flowers, chickens, etc.
-P-A-G-E-125
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 87 
B—FOR BOYS. 
(a) A systematic course in shopwork, carpentry, mechanical drawing, lathe work, 
or any line developing the skillful use of tools. 
(6) A systematic course in agriculture or gardening that shall embrace the planting, 
cultivation, and harvesting of a field or garden crop; or in horticulture that shall 
include the care and harvesting of a crop, including grafting, spraying, and pruning. 
Tt may also embrace the raising of flowers and ornamental plants, care of shrubbery, etc. 
C—FOR BOYS AND GIRLS, BUSINESS COURSES. q 
(a) Creditmay be given for systematic course in business training that shall embrace 
bookkeeping and typewriting; it may include office work, stenography, and commer- 
cial law and business forms in general. 
(6) For work in offices or similar positions where such courses may be obtained ina 
business way, but without professional instruction. 
Credit will be given by the superintendent for such work not to exceed one-half 
unit in any one year in any one line. The total credit of alloutside courses must not 
exceed two units. 
Under A credit will be given upon the recommendation of a committee of women 
appointed by the superintendent and approved by the board of education or its 
president. 
Under B credit will be given in the same manner upon the recommendation of a 
committee of men appointed by the superintendent and approved by the board of 
education or its president. 
Under © credit will be given in same manner as under B. 
Application for such courses must be made in advance to the superintendent and the 
details of the proposed course fully arranged with him by the parents or guardian, or 
some one who may represent them. All work must be done under supervision that 
those in charge of the high school are satisfied is competent and thorough. The 
right is reserved to cancel any course that they believe is not being carried out 
properly. 
Credit for work done in music under the instruction of a competent 
private teacher is meeting with favor. Many girls attempt to carry 
lessons in instrumental music, which require several hours of practice 
a day, in addition to their regular high-school studies. Few can do 
this, and many are thus compelled either to drop out of school that they 
may devote their time to music, or drop their music altogether. A 
child musically inclined is thus handicapped. That school officials 
are coming to recognize the necessity for giving credit for music 
taken outside of school, provided no music course is offered by the 
school, is shown by the many reports received at this bureau. The 
following report from Junction City, Kans., is typical: 
There has been a growing demand among the pupils of the high school to take some 
form of instrumental music outside of school. To do this, they have had to either 
run the risk of overwork or postponing their musical training until later in life. The 
school authorities have arrived at the conclusion that a serious and thorough study of 
singing or the playing of any musical instrument is as truly a part of education as any 
regular school subject. Hence, one unit credit a year is granted toward graduation for 
music taken outside of school on the basis of the requirement of 32 credits for gradua- 
tion, provided the work is taken under specified supervision. 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  88 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
One of the newer experiments is that of giving credit for Sunday 
school or church work done out of school. The following is an expla- 
nation of the plan recently adopted at Olathe, Kans.: 
Requirements.—Those seeking the credit for Bible study in Sunday schools shall be 
regularly enrolled students of the high school. Attendance at Sunday school shall 
count 10 points. Lesson preparation and recitation shall count 10 points. Attend- 
ance at preaching service shall count 10 points. (Record of these shall be kept by the 
Sunday schools.) Examination at the close of each high-school semester given by 
the high-school authorities shall count 70 points. Certificates of attendance and study 
must be made for each pupil seeking credit by the Sunday school superintendent to 
the city superintendent of schools before the semester examination shall be given. 
No person who has not at least a credit of 90 per cent Sunday school attendance shall 
be permitted to take the examination. 
Examination and ecredit—The examination shall be nonsectarian. The questions 
shall be upon the International Sunday School Lessons, and shall be made out by a 
committee of representatives of the various Sunday schools giving the credit work, 
in connection with the high-school authorities. At least two Sunday schools must 
have representatives present at the time of making out the questions. 
The attendance record, study and recitation record, together with the semester 
examination must make at least 75 per cent, which shall be entered upon the records 
ofthe Olathe high school each year as a credit equal to one-fourth year’s work in any 
elective in the high-school courses. Sunday school work following these require- 
ments through the four years of the high-school] course will take the place of and 
receive the credit for any elective for one year, or in other words will constitute 1 
of the 16 units necessary for graduation from the Olathe high schools. 
At Falls City, Nebr., arrangements have been made so that pupils 
in the high school may take up Bible study privately or under the 
supervision of any one of the teachers of the city without regard to 
creed. Any version of the Bible may be used—the Douay, the 
King James, or the revised version. At present 30 pupils are enrolled 
in the course, for which one full credit is allowed each semester. 
VOCATIONAL SUBJECTS. 
As yet, the smaller cities have done little to introduce practical or 
vocational courses except in those cities where special aid is given to 
schools for maintaining such courses.! Of 1,330 of these cities reply- 
ing to a questionnaire, 753 report courses in industrial training, often 
meaning nothing more than regular manual training courses. There 
are healthful indications, however, that within the next few years the 
smaller cities will, with funds provided by the State and National 
Governments, forge ahead with well-defined vocational courses.” 
AGRICULTURE. 
One of the vocational subjects that is beginning to receive attention 
in the small city school is agriculture. During the past year 351 
cities have introduced agricultural courses or have extended the work.   
1 For alist of cities having household arts instruction, see Andrews, Education for the Home, Pt. IV,

SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES, 89 
Many have introduced not only theoretical courses, but also practical 
demonstration courses. The following are typical illustrations: 
Hannibal, Mo.—One year is devoted to agriculture, there being double daily periods, 
The laboratory or demonstration part of the course is given in connection with all 
topics. 
Aberdeen, S. Dak.—Agriculture and gardening work have been introduced into the 
schools of Aberdeen, S. Dak. During the year 165 private gardens and 3 public 
gardens were conducted under the supervision of the school. Two courses in agri-- 
culture were offered, one in agronomy and one in animal husbandry. The board of 
education has secured 40 acres in the edge of the city, which is being prepared for the 
agronomy classes. 
York, Nebr.—The course in agriculture covers a period of five years. The school 
board owns a farm of 9 acres, 4 acres being devoted to rotation and fertilizer experi- 
ments, and the rest to a. school museum and demonstration work. 
Boise, Idaho.—¥our years’ work is offered in agriculture, consisting of the following 
courses: First, farm crops; second, farm soils; third, farm mechanics; fourth, horti- 
culture; fifth, farm animals; sixth, farm chemistry. The work is made practical from 
every standpoint. The school rents a farm, owns a team and farm implements, and 
has for two years cultivated the infield of the State fair grounds. The board rents a 
12-acre commercial orchard, which the pupils spray and prune. Pupils also plant, 
spray, and prune many other orchards in the community, and make frequent excur- 
sions to ranches where live stock is kept, that they may study the various types and 
breeds of farm animals. Some time is devoted to judging various classes of horses, 
beef cattle, dairy cows, sheep, and hogs. The work in agriculture is under the super- 
vision of an expert employed by the business men and the school board of Boise to 
assist the farmers of the county. 
SHORT-TERM COURSES. 
One item of progress that should not be omitted in a survey of 
conditions in the smaller cities is the introduction of short- term 
courses for adults. The following are typical of such courses: 
Sauk Rapids, Minn.—An agricultural short course is maintained for 10 weeks during 
the winter months for the benefit of farmers and others who wish to become acquainted. 
with the rudiments of the subject. 
Jackson, Miss.—A short course of 10 weeks in domestic science and household 
chemistry is maintained for the benefit of young women and matrons. 
Grafton, N. Dak.—A short course of 8 weeks is provided the young people on the 
farm in agriculture, domestic art, manual training and commercial subjects. 
Sterling, Colo.—During the winter months the school board of Sterling offers a short 
course for farmers and farmers’ wives or others who are interested in blacksmithery, 
carpentry, gasoline engines, farm accounts, dressmaking, cooking, household manag- 
ing, etc. These courses are taught by practical people chosen from among the most 
successful in the community. During the term 1912-13 the registration reached over 
100. The people of the community are encouraged to bring their problems ta the 
school and to work on them there; when they reach a point where they need assist- 
ance, the person in charge of the course helps as the case may demand. 
INTERESTING THE COMMUNITY. 
Schoolmen have become conscious of the fact that, if the schools 
are to make progress, the people must be kept informed of school 
conditions and of the needs of the schools and that their cooperation  
-P-A-G-E-128
  90 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
must be secured. Experience has shown that a superintendent ean 
not advance his schools any further than public opinion will permit. 
As a consequence, many superintendents in the smaller cities are 
using every means possible to keep the people informed in regard to 
educational progress throughout the country. Any survey of educa- 
tional progress in those cities that omits a discussion of methods 
in use for arousing community interest in the schools would omit 
one of the great factors that determine progress. Superintendents 
are beginning to identify themselves with the commercial clubs in 
their respective cities in order to come in touch with the business 
men of the communities. At Winston-Salem, N. C., the board of 
trade became so interested in the schools that it organized a juvenile 
department composed of high-school boys. This work of the busi- 
ness men has helped to focus attention upon the work of the schools, 
and the practical character of the work done has appealed to those 
citizens who felt that the schools were educating the boys away 
from community life rather than toward it.! 
The superintendent of schools at Kearney, N. J., has had the 
support of the business men of that city because he asked them 
to help him. The manufacturers and corporations were criticizing 
the school product. In order to get at the root of the matter, he 
sent a questionnaire to each firm, inviting a full statement on the 
following points: 
In what respect do you find the pupils employed by you to be deficient? 
State fully and frankly the weakness of the public-school product. 
What suggestions can you give to help us in our work of preparing the children for 
your business? 
According to reports received at this bureau, many helpful sug- 
gestions were made. Considerable interest was manifested by various 
business men who are now speaking with approval of the work of 
the schools. 
One significant factor in securing the cooperation of the community 
is frank publicity. School boards that are managing the schools 
ably and honestly do not fear to turn on the searchlight, and the 
sentiment is growing among school boards that the public should 
know how its money is expended. In the most progressive schools, 
the board and the superintendent are presenting facts to the people 
either in printed reports, in newspaper articles, or by both. As 
yet, printed reports are not common among cities under 25,000. 
Since 1911, only 250 of these cities have sent printed reports to this 
bureau, although it has made frequent requests for them. 
Many superintendents do not publish school reports in pamphlet 
form because of the expense, because the facts can be presented

SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 91 
through the newspapers, and because formidable looking reports are 
often cast aside. Someschoolmen, however, object to using the news- 
papers on the ground that they are thereby “‘advertising”’ themselves. 
A superintendent who was complaining about lack of interest among 
the parents in the schools of his city was asked whether he reported the 
progress of the schools through the local papers. He replied that he 
did not believe in advertising himself. He failed to grasp the idea 
that school news is not for the purpose of boosting a superintendent, 
but to call attention to the needs of the work of the school so that 
it may become more efficient. In several cities, as Fredonia, Kans., 
there is an educational issue of the local paper. In some other 
cities there are daily school news notes. On the whole, the public 
is becoming better informed regarding the schools than it was a few 
years ago. The tendency is toward greater publicity by means of 
printed reports and newspaper articles. 
That the schools can work to advantage through women’s civic 
improvement clubs and through parent-teacher associations has 
been thoroughly demonstrated in many of the smaller cities. Such 
clubs are often instrumental in the introduction of kindergartens, 
manual training, and domestic science. The superintendent of one 
school utilized the women’s clubs of the city by asking that each 
club give some consideration to the question, What can be done to 
improve the efficiency of your schools? Each club discussed the 
question and sent a representative to present to the teachers the 
ideas of the club. In the opinion of the superintendent of schools 
in that city, the plan aroused interest among the women of the city 
in better schools. 
A monthly mimeographed letter addressed to parents is one of 
the features of the schools of Shenandoah, Iowa. In these letters 
the superintendent discusses, among other things, the necessity of 
punctuality, regular attendance, and methods of preventing diseases 
among school children. Other methods reported for arousing inter- 
est in school work (already described), include credits for home work, 
school exhibits, visitors’ days, and the use of the school building as 
a social center. 
WIDER USE OF THE SCHOOL PLANT. 
Social and civic centers..—The wider use of the school plant has 
not been confined to the larger cities. Of 1,334 of the cities of 30,000 
population and less reporting to the Bureau of Education, 503 use 
the school buildings for other than school purposes; 171 report 
that the school buildings are used as polling places. Of the 71 
cities of all sizes reporting to the Russell Sage Foundation that   
1 See also chapter 21, p. 455, of this report. 
   
-P-A-G-E-130
  92 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
they employ some paid workers in carrying on evening activities 
other than those of the regular night school, 24 are in cities of 25,000 
population and less. 
Many more of the cities under 25,000 could open their school 
buildings for social center purposes. Statistics at hand show that 
of 1,334 of these cities reporting, 314 have auditoriums in at least 
one grade building and 888 have auditoriums in the high-school 
building, while 95 of the grade buildings and 450 of the high-school 
buildings have gymnasiums. 
VACATION SCHOOLS. 
In many of the smaller cities the school buildings no longer stand 
idle three months during the summer vacation. No statistics are 
available showing how many of these cities conduct summer schools, 
but during the past year there has been an increase of 147. There 
are two types of vacation schools: One aims to educate through play 
and to keep the children off the street; the other to help children who 
have lost time or who are capable of gaining a grade. These schools 
are usually in session from four to eight weeks. The following are 
extracts from a few of the many letters received at the Bureau of 
Education regarding vacation schools: 
Carlisle, Pa.—The summer school is for high-school students who have failed. The 
term is from June 30 to August 22; had a total enrollment of 30 students at the end of 
the term; 16 passed their examinations. The term for 1914 had an enrollment of 26; 
of this number 23 were promoted. 
Bloomfield, N. J—The vacation school is in the foreign section of the city, with no 
play grounds near, and the children have nothing to do but run and play in dirty 
streets. The school was organized to assist them in passing a profitable vacation. The 
girls were taught to sew; the boys were given useful work in woodworking; the smaller 
children were given kindergarten training, and all were given much practice in oral 
English, something needed by these people. 
Mount Pleasant, Pa.—The discipline in the summer school was perfect, without 
effort; retarded children made remarkable progress on short-time instruction hours; 
attendance was regular without the services of an attendance officer. 
Montclair, N. J—The number taking examinations at the close of the term was 142; 
of this number 90, or 64.8 per cent, were promoted. This reports merely the educa- 
tional side of the work; the results from the three play centers can not be measured by 
figures, 
EVENING SCHOOLS. 
In many of the smaller cities, school boards have opened the school 
buildings for evening schools, most of which are supported from pub- 
lic funds. During the year evening schools have been established 
or evening school work extended in 170 cities. Although no proof is 
necessary to show the value of such schools, the following examples 
are typical of what the opening of the school buildings for evening 
schools can do for young men and young women:
-P-A-G-E-131
SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 93 
Nearly all the evening school pupils at Spartanburg, 8. ©., are mill operatives. 
Many of them are illiterate and are taught to read and write. One 17-year-old boy who 
had finished the sixth grade in the day school was employed as lineman on an inter- 
urban trolley line and attended the evening school where he learned something of the 
rules of mensuration which he used in his work of cutting cables for guy wires to steady 
the poles and for getting the exact length of trolley wires on curves. His wages were 
increased 50 per cent before the evening school closed. 
The evening school at Morris, Tll., has increased the earning capacity of many of the 
pupils enrolled. A clerk was advanced to the position of bookkeeper, a young man 
was given employment as typist in a law office, a young woman was employed as sten- 
ographer in a shoe company’s office, another was employed as typist for a public li- 
brary, and three entered business colleges with advanced standing. 
The evening school of Peabody, Mass., is composed almost entirely of non-English- 
speaking foreigners who have acquired after several terms a fair working knowledge of 
English. 
Although progress has been made in extending the use of school 
buildings for evening classes, many school reports lament the fact 
that the attendance at evening schools is irregular and that half the 
students drop out before the close of the term. In some instances it 
has been discovered that the courses are not suited to the class of 
students. The method now followed in most schools in planning 
evening courses is to discover what the people want before a course 
is advertised.t 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS AND CLASSES. 
As yet the smaller city schools have not seriously attacked the 
problem of caring for the feeble-minded and seriously backward chil- 
dren. In answer to a questionnaire submitted in 1913 by Dr. J. E. W. 
Wallin, then of the University of Pittsburgh, only 28 of the smaller 
cities reported such schools, 11 of these being in New Jersey, where 
children three years behind grade must be placed in a special class; 
24 of these cities give a special examination before admitting pupils 
to classes for backward children; 5 require a medical, psychological, 
and educational examination; 9 a medical or psychological; 3 a 
psychological or educational; and 6 a psychological examination. 
Dr. Wallin finds that the preparation of the teachers for these schools 
has been gained mostly in special summer courses; that 21 cities 
use the Binet tests and that only one of these maintains a child study 
laboratory or psychological clinic. Of the cities of 25,000 population 
and less reporting to Dr. Wallin, 34 have ungraded classes. The aver- 
age number of pupils to each class is 15. In 10 of these cities the 
classes are wholly ungraded, while the others are for backward and 
truant children and for special help classes. Dr. Wallin concludes: 
That the classes for the feebl2-minded are relatively more numerous in cities above 
25,000, while the ungraded classes are relatively more numerous in cities below 25,000.

grants,”’ p. 425. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  
  94 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
This is probably not due to the fact that there are relatively more feeble-minded and 
seriously backward pupils in the larger cities, but to the fact that the smaller cities 
have not yet become thoroughly alive to administrative educational problems affect- 
ing these children. The alleged explanation that there are not enough seriously defec- 
tive children in the smaller cities, say conservatively in cities of 10,000 and over, to 
make up a class is without foundation. 
There are different plans in operation to help retarded children up 
to grade or to make them more efficient. In a few cities, the over- 
age children are given about half time in the shops and the other half 
in the regular classroom or in a classroom under a special teacher. 
Other cities employ one or more special teachers to help forward 
children who for one reason or another have fallen behind their 
classes. The following plan in operation at Franklin, Mass., is one 
of the common methods: 
One teacher works among grades from one to four, inclusive, while the other works 
in grades five to eight. These teachers visit the different buildings on stated days, 
having regular schedules for their work in the different buildings. The regular 
teachers select those pupils who are backward because of absence on account of sick- 
ness or otherwise, those who are slow to grasp principles, or weak in any particular 
subject, and send them to the special teacher for individual instruction. Each 
regular teacher is careful to state explicitly the real difficulty of the pupil, so that 
the special teacher may lose no time in finding the weakness and thereby is able to 
help at once the pupil in his difficulty. 
The special teacher keeps an exact record of the number of pupils helped, the 
difficulty to be overcome, the number of times the pupil is sent, the progress made, 
and the results. The regular teacher also keeps a record of those sent and the results. 
The superintendent reports: 
From the records at hand a great saving of time and strength to the regular teachers 
has been accomplished; a large number of pupils have been kept up to grade, and will 
be promoted. Otherwise, many of these pupils would have failed of promotion, 
which means double cost of instruction for these same pupils. 
HEALTH OF THE CHILD. 
A problem still to be solved by the smaller cities is that of health 
inspection. Of 1,300 of those reporting, only 516 have medical 
inspection, more than half of these being in those few States making 
medical inspection compulsory. Of these 516 cities, only 86 employ 
a school nurse and only 12 a physician for the entire time. There can 
be no doubt that medical inspection in many of the smaller cities and 
towns is perfunctory, even in those States where such inspection is 
compulsory. Many school boards decline to employ a medical 
inspector on the ground that an examination by a physician paid 
only a few hundred dollars a year would be superficial. In a few of 
these cities inspection is made free by the physicians acting in coop- 
eration. Jeannette, Pa., a city of about 10,000 population, was one

SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 95 
of the first cities to introduce medical inspection of this type. The 
superintendent of the Jeannette schools says of the operation of this 
plan: 
In thiscommunity medical inspection is conducted practically without expense to the 
taxpayers. Theschool board has, however, equipped aroom with everything necessary 
for the examination and the work was begun five years ago. The people of the commu- 
nity were assured that the work would be suggestive merely, and they were asked to 
cooperate. All the children were examined; they received cards indicating defects; 
and their parents were advised to see the family physician or dentist, as the case might 
be. Free clinics were offered for those who did not feel financially able to have 
the work done. No nurse has ever been employed, but the teachers were asked to 
follow up the work as much as possible and to report to the superintendent the results 
noted. Many children had operations of a minor nature performed, and there was 
a decided improvement in the care of the teeth and general personal appearance. 
* * * * * * * 
The cost of the necessary equipment for this plan does not exceed $150. As there 
is no other expense attached to the examination, any small town can do the work. 
Our experience has shown that as a result of the free medical inspection the children 
are cleaner and neater in appearance; incipient cases of tuberculosis are discovered 
in time to be successfully treated; trouble with adenoids is detected in many cases; 
defective eyes are helped before it is too late; a bad heart found in time to save. 
These and many other instances have convinced Jeannette that medical inspection 
is very much worth while. 
From a recent questionnaire it is ascertained that there has been a 
rapid increase in the cities requiring medical inspection. ‘The con- 
sensus of opinion among schoolmen in the smaller cities is that such 
inspection will not be made to yield its best results until school 
boards are enabled to employ a physician who can devote practically 
all his time to the school and that a school nurse is absolutely essen- 
tial to secure the best results; and that in a small city a school nurse 
is probably more effective than a medical examiner alone. 
OPEN-AIR SCHOOLS. 
The number of small cities that have established open-air schools 
is worthy of note, considering that the first open-air school in this 
country was opened only seven years ago, and that in 1910 there were 
only 10 such schools in the United States. To-day there are open-air 
schools in 130 cities, 40 being in the group of cities of 25,000 and less 
population. Some of ‘these, however, have only open-air kinder- 
gartens, while others have open-air rooms for anemic and tuberculous 
children. Some few cities have introduced the cold-room idea. This 
plan has been tried at Middletown, Conn., with 1,200 pupils. Reports 
from that city say that the pupils have improved physically and that 
the teachers are not so exhausted at the close of school. 
That the health of the pupils in the schools at Alameda, Cal., may 
be conserved, the school buildings are constructed on the convertible

  96 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
plan, so that in favorable weather all the rooms may be conducted as 
open-air classes. These classes are part of the regular school system 
and are for children without regard to their physical condition. 
JANITORS. 
It is undoubtedly true that not enough attention is given by 
school boards in the smaller cities to the employment and super- 
vision of janitors. The health of school children, both physical and 
moral, depends in no small degree upon the janitor. Of 1,350 cities 
reporting, only 56 examine janitors on methods of sanitation. As far 
as can be learned, these examinations are in many instances super- 
ficial. In 476 of these cities janitors are permitted to employ their 
own help out of a salary made large enough to permit them to do this. 
In many instances this plan has been unsuccessful, since janitors are 
likely to employ help cheaply, without regard to efficiency. From 
reports received at this bureau it is evident that more attention is 
being given to the employment and supervision of janitors in the 
smaller cities. In several places janitors’ meetings under the direction 
of the superintendent have proved helpful. The tendency is to 
place janitors under the direct supervision of the superintendent or 
principal of the building. In 641 of the 1,350 cities reporting, 
janitors are under the direct supervision of the superintendent or 
one of his assistants, while in the others they are under the direct 
supervision of the board. 
PLAYGROUNDS. 
Play has come to be recognized as one of the best means of pre- 
serving a child’s health, yet the schools have been rather slow to 
provide sufficient play space for children. In 496 cities the average 
size of ground surrounding the school buildings is less than one-half 
acre; in 355 from one-half acre to 1 acre; in 318, from 1 to 2 acres, 
and in only 181 are there more than 2 acres. Practically every city 
reporting small grounds declares that in the erection of new buildings 
more playground is to be provided. In addition to the school play- 
ground, a few cities have established public playgrounds under the 
direction of a play supervisor. In most instances, however, a super- 
visor is employed for only a part of the year, usually for a few weeks 
during vacation. The Yearbook of the Playground and Recreation 
Society of America reports 22 cities of 25,000 population and less 
with recreation work carried on through the year with at least one 
paid worker. During 1913 seventy cities gave the children play- 
grounds for the first time. Of this number 53 were in cities of 25,000 
population and less.
-P-A-G-E-135
  SCHOOL PROGRESS IN THE SMALLER CITIES, 97 
No doubt one factor that has not been sufficiently considered in 
the smaller cities in the care of the health of the children is that of 
frequent rest and relaxation periods during school hours. Of 1,269 
cities reporting, 159 have one intermission, not including the noon 
hour; 1,072 have two, and 40 have three; in 125 cities the noon hour 
is from one-fourth to one-half hour in length; in 222 from one-half 
to one hour; in 854 from one to one and a half hours, and in 76 from 
one and a half to two hours. 
CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION. 
How pupils shall be classified so that they may advance through the 
grades without loss of time is a question that is continually presenting 
itself to thoughtful superintendents. A few of the current experi- 
ments in this field in smaller city schools are given below: 
Carthage, N. Y.—Al1 those children who can not read are started on their educational 
journey in much the same way. Gradually they are regrouped into three divisions: 
The first, composed of the most mature and most capable, completes a certain amount 
of work in one year; the next group is given one and one-half years in which to ac- 
complish the same amount, and the third two years. Before the close of the first 
year each of the three groups is likely to be divided again into the higher and lower. 
Therefore each pupil who enters in the fall with no knowledge of the books has before 
him the possibility of being in any one of six groups before the close of the first year. 
There is a special teacher in the lower grades who devotes her entire time to misfits— 
those pupils who for some reason or other can not do all of their work to the best advan- 
tage in any of the regular groups. This teacher coaches backward pupils and helps 
the brilliant ones to jump to the next higher division. 
A pupil who fails in one or two subjects belonging to his group, but keeps up in the 
other subjects is allowed to recite with a lower group in the subjects in which he is 
deficient, while continuing regular work in all other subjects. Similarly, brilliant 
pupils or pupils capable of doing a higher grade of work in some one subject or two are 
allowed the chance. 
East Chicago, Ind.—A child is promoted at any time the teacher and supervisors 
feel that he would be benefited. The plan is to pass pupils if they are doing their 
best, even if the grades are low. Teachers and principals are requested to make a 
report on all special pupils, giving their school history. 
Williamsburg, Va.—The superintendent says: We use the shifting group plan of grad- 
ing pupils and a form of reports to parents that keep parents thoroughly informed as 
to the pupil’s standing during the year. As each weakness of a pupil is discovered by 
the teacher, it becomes a matter of special consideration and study by teacher, parents, 
principal, and the pupil. Tentative shifts can be made atany time. The aim is to 
relieve the teacher of all red tape and to reduce routine to the minimum but to insist 
upon a constant and sympathetic study of the child—every child—but particularly 
every child who is in danger of falling behind his class. No percentages or grades 
are accepted from a teacher as excuses for promotion or demotion. Ifa pupil is weak, 
efforts are made to ascertain the exact nature of his weakness early in the term and 
remedy it. 
One of the signs of progress is that few schools now rely entirely 
upon examinations as a test for promotion. In some schools exam-

  98 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
inations are made to count one-half, while in others they count only 
one-fourth. It is now recognized that examinations are not true 
tests of the pupil’s ability to do the next grade’s work, and that a 
pupil should not be promoted on what he knows, but on what he can 
do. Of 756 superintendents in the smaller cities reporting, 669 say 
that they are now depending on examinations much less than formerly.

RURAL EDUCATION. 
By J. L. McBrien, 
School Extension Agent, United States Bureau of Education. 
ContTENTS.—Introduction—Conference for education in the South—Conference of State rural-school super- 
visors—Teacher training for rural schools—Rural school extension—The county unit—Rural-school 
legislation—Free textbooks—Agricultural education and home economics—Ideals in rural education. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Progress in rural education for the school year 1913-14 is seen not 
alone in the actual achievements of the year, but in the plans for the 
future, and in the advanced position taken by leading educators 
relative to rural education and rural-life problems. 
This progress found expression in various ways. It was a “clean- 
up day” campaign for beautifying school buildings and grounds and 
for putting things in shipshape order for the opening of school in sey- 
eral States that now make this an annual event. In some States it 
was a campaign for a library in every rural school. In other States 
educational rallies, school fairs, and farmers’ chautauquas were potent 
factors in arousing a desire among the people for better schools. 
There were doubtless more rural-school and rural-life conferences 
held under the auspices of State normal schools, colleges, and uni- 
versities and by various other organizations during the past year 
than in any single year within the last five years. In all of these 
meetings the improvement of the rural schools and the betterment 
of rural life were the paramount issues for study and discussion. 
The daily and weekly newspapers and the weekly and monthly maga- 
zines gave more space to rural problems during the past year than for 
many years previous. 
The attendance of rural teachers at summer sessions of colleges, 
universities, and normal schools during the past summer was so 
marked as to make for progress in rural education. At the Illinois 
State Normal University over 500 rural teachers were in attendance; 
at the Iowa State Teachers’ College, 1,200; and in Ohio over 7,000 
rural teachers attended summer schools in 1914. Teacher training for 
rural schools never received so much attention in a single year. 
99 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  
  100 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Interest in consolidation of rural schools has greatly increased.t 
The people are slowly but surely’ becoming convinced that the one- 
room, one-teacher rural school has, in the main, outlived its useful- 
ness and that, wherever feasible and possible, the consolidated rural 
school must take its place. 
A larger unit of organization for rural schools has been one of the 
chief topics of discussion during the year.?_ The opinion is spreading 
among the people that the old independent school district as the unit 
of taxation and administration must give way to the township or 
county unit. 
Marked progress was made in the increased appropriations by 
various States as well as the Federal Government for the cause of 
rural education and the betterment of rural-life conditions. For 
example, in 1913 the maximum limit of school taxation was raised 
by legislative act for the rural schools of Nebraska from 25 mills to 
35 mills; Mississippi increased the appropriation for her county agri- 
cultural high schools $100,000; and the Smith-Lever bill, passed by 
the Sixty-third Congress and approved by the President May 8, 1914, 
will ultimately carry over $4,500,000 annually for agricultural ex- 
tension and rural welfare. 
Progress in rural education is still laboriously slow, however. The 
average education of the American citizen in 1800, according to Dr. 
E. A. Ross, of the University of Wisconsin, was only 82 days. Itis 
now 1,057 days, still less than six years. Not until the average edu- 
cation of the rural American has reached 12 years—education that 
fits for life and prepares for the duties of citizenship—can we boast 
of our progress in rural education. 
CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
The conference for education in the South during the 17 years of 
its history has done some notable things for the progress of rural 
education in the Southern States, but the lessons it demonstrated at 
Louisville, Ky., in April, 1914, are of inestimable value to the entire 
country. The aim of this conference was to show “How to organize 
and build up country life.” There were demonstrations of cooper- 
ative growing and marketing associations; women’s clubs for house- 
hold equipment and home making; boys’ and girls’ clubs; sanitary 
home, country school, country church; excursions to blue-grass farms. 
There were conferences of farmers, country women, country preach- 
ers, country doctors, school workers, editors, and business men. 
The fundamental ideas to be gained from this conference are 
summed up by Dr. A. P. Bourland, its secretary:

1. The greatest social need of the century is the organization and consequent 
upbuilding of the rural life of America. 
2, This must be the outgrowth of the self-activity of rural life forces. 
3. Outside forces can only assist in this work. 
4, There is a need of raising the general level of living in the country in order to 
keep the brightest and best people from leaving the country in too great numbers. 
5. To educate the young in the schools, to elevate their ideals, to arouse their ambi- 
tions without raising the level of living and offering them a broader field for the exer- 
cise of their talents may do as much harm as good. 
6. The school is only one of these agencies for community upbuilding. 
7. There must be a cooperation among the rural life forces, all working together 
for a common end. 
8. The farmer, the country woman, the country teacher, the country editor, the 
country doctor, the country business man, and the country preacher shall and must 
all join hands for a hard pull, a long pull, and a pull all together for better living along 
every line in the country. 
9, The community is the proper unit for rural development. 
10. The community must learn how to educate, to organize, and to develop itself, 
CONFERENCE OF STATE RURAL SCHOOL SUPERVISORS. 
The first national conference of State supervisors and inspectors 
of rural schools was held under the auspices of the United States 
Bureau of Education at Louisville, Ky., April 6-9, 1914. The con- 
ference devoted its time to a discussion of the topic ‘The best 
methods for the improvement of the rural schools through State 
supervision,” under the following subtopics: (a) Through demon- 
stration schools; () through local supervisors; (c) through con- 
solidation; (d) through standardization; (e) through preparation of 
rural teachers; (f) through improvement of teachers in service; (g) 
through community activities; (4) through county industrial super- 
visors. 
fter devoting the first three days of the conference to a thorough 
discussion of these topics, committees were appointed to bring in 
reports embodying a consensus of the opinion of the conference on 
each question. The fourth day was devoted to a discussion of the 
reports, a summary of which follows: 
Demonstration schools ——We recognize in the demonstration school or school for 
special demonstration purposes a splendid way of showing the people in a definite 
and concrete way what a school can do for a community. 
Local supervision.—There should be a much closer local supervision of the school 
than has hitherto existed in the majority of the States. There should be in each 
county, township, or parish, as a minimum supervisory force, a superintendent of 
schools, and under his direction, a supervisor of schools, a director of agricultural 
education, a director of education in household science and arts, and an office clerk. 
Consolidation.—We indorse the consolidated school as one of the greatest single 
factors in rural school improvement. 
Standardization —As fundamental principles of standardization we recommend the 
following, viz, (1) minimum material equipment; (2) minimum qualification for 
teachers, including or looking toward a degree of physical training; (3) closer and 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
  
  102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
abler rural school supervision; (4) compulsory education, or a high rate of enrollment 
based on enumeration, and a high rate of daily attendance, based on enrollment; (5) 
a minimum length of school term; (6) an approved State and local course of study, 
and it is agreed that in the work of standardization we can not get beyond require- 
ments for material features until schools are adequately supervised by State super- 
visors of rural schools. 
Preparation of rural teachers.—The new farm school calls for a new kind of teacher, 
professionally prepared, who shall understand the difficult problems of present-age 
life and shall have the right vision of this life and be willing to live it in the midst of 
the country community. 
Such teachers should (1) be community leaders, (2) be masters of the subject matter 
taught, and (3) strong in modern rural school organization and administration. 
We urge the State normal schools and other schools whose province it is to prepare 
elementary and secondary teachers to organize, as soon as practicable, distinct and 
complete departments for the preparation of rural teachers. We further urge such 
agricultural colleges as do not now offer professional preparation in agricultural edu- 
cation to add a professional staff to their faculty, to the end that the future agricul- 
tural teachers in our farm schools may have a pedagogical as well as a technical foun- 
dation for successful work; and, finally, we urge the importance of establishing schools 
or departments of schools in which country-life leaders and agricultural experts of 
every kind may be prepared for their important work. 
Training the untrained teachers now at work in country schools.—The following have 
been found successful in training the rural teachers at work: 
1. The county supervising teaclier: The county supervising teacher visits the school 
of the novice at the beginning of the session, helps her organize her school, classify her 
pupils, make her daily program, and demonstrates correct methods of teaching, 
especially with the beginners. 
2. The demonstration school: Every county should have several country schools 
under the charge of especially efficient, experienced teachers. The untrained begin- 
ners should be given an opportunity to visit these schools and observe the work. 
8. The teacher’s manual: The teacher’s manual should not be merely an outline 
of the course of study. It should constitute an elementary pedagogy of the country 
school and should offer concrete suggestions adapted to the particular needs of the 
State for which it is designed. 
4. The county institute: The short-term county institute, held just previous to the 
opening of the school year, gives the county superintendent and supervising teacher 
an opportunity to correct many of the mistakes which would otherwise be made by 
untrained teachers. ‘ 
5. The county teachers’ association: The programs of the county teachers’ associa- 
tions should deal with the practical workings of the schoolroom. These programs 
should frequently include model lessons, followed by free discussion. 
6. The teachers’ reading circle: The teachers’ reading circle offers to the young 
teacher an opportunity of enlarging and organizing her experience. 
7. The summer school for teachers: Thousands of teachers have, through summer 
schools, been given an opportunity to study educational principles and practices. 
Community activities —From the standpoint of the pupils, the school should have 
courses in agriculture, domestic science, and manual training; public debates and 
amateur plays, school exhibits and fairs, and organized play, including county field 
days. ‘The school should encourage the organization and direct the work of corn 
and canning clubs. 
From the standpoint of the adults, the schoolhouse, should be open at least one 
evening each week for lyceums, free lectures, discussions of civic and economic 
questions, and for social and recreational gatherings. In order to carry out the pro-
-P-A-G-E-141
RURAL EDUCATION. 103 
gram, there should be organized in each school a community club consisting of all 
the adults of the community. This organization should adopt a constitution, elect 
officers, hold regular meetings, and outline each year a program of work for community 
improvement. 
Improvement of rural schools through county indusirial supervisors.—We recognize the 
necessity of making the rural schools more useful in building up a better rural civili- 
zation, and we recognize the fact that the limitations of the average country school are 
such that the teacher can hardly break away from the traditional character of work 
without personal aid and demonstration from outside sources. 
1. We therefore indorse the work of the county industrial supervisor in introducing 
the arts pertaining to home making, cooking, sanitation, and farm life into the rural 
schools. : 
2. We recommend that such a supervising industrial teacher be employed for the 
entire year. 
3. We recommend that club work, such as the organization of boys’ and girls’ clubs, 
and demonstration in the growing and canning of fruit and vegetables, be a part of the 
work of this teacher; and that such a teacher should promote citizens’ leagues to 
organize and improve the social life of the community, as well as to assist in improving 
school facilities. x 
4, We recommend that this teacher be employed by the county school authorities, 
and work under the direction of the county superintendent. 
5. We recommend that the State supervisor cooperate with the county superin- 
tendent and assist in planning and directing this work. 
6. We indorse the work of the Jeanes fund in cooperating with the county super- 
intendents in employing supervising industrial teachers for the negro rural schools of 
the South. 
7. We indorse all philanthropic efforts to supply State and county supervision 
looking toward the betterment of the rural schools, but we believe that eventually 
all such supervisory work should become a part of the public-school system. 
TEACHER TRAINING FOR RURAL SCHOOLS. 
l. First national conference—At the first national conference on 
teacher training for rural schools in Chicago, September 24-26, 
called by the United States Commissioner of Education at the re- 
quest of several of the State departments of education, the follow- 
ing resolutions were adopted: 
Whereas an investigation recently conducted by the National Bureau of Education 
discloses the fact that 32.7 per cent of the rural teachers now in service in the United 
States have had no professional preparation for their work; and in view of the accepted 
significance of rural education to our national life, and as the success of all rural edu- 
cation depends to a large extent upon the teacher: Therefore be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this conference that all educational institutions 
which can readily lend themselves to such purpose be utilized to train teachers for 
the rural schools: 
1. Universities and colleges throughout the country where consistent with practical 
administration, that these services be interpreted to include the establishment of 
high standards of rural life and education and the actual work of training for rural 
leadership. 
2. State and private normal schools in special departments of rural education, and 
in the preparation of teachers for teacher-training departments in high schools and 
county normals. 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
38. State agricultural colleges in their departments of education through the right 
training of men and women to teach in the secondary schools such subjects as agricul- 
ture, manual training, and home economics; that the agricultural college is also doing 
a proper work in this direction when it is promoting the idea of vocational education 
in the minds of all the people—patrons, teachers, and children; that the agricultural 
college should be looked to as the authoritative source of agricultural knowledge; the 
agricultural high schools should not only have for their highest purpose the training 
of young people for the farm and home and in the promotion of vocational education, 
ut they should be expected to add much professional work for effective teaching in 
the rural schools. 
4. That the preparation of teachers for rural schools in county training schools and 
in teacher-training classes in high schools is approved as a policy where more exten- 
sive training is not at present feasible; and it is recommended that such training in 
high schools should not be given before the junior year and no diploma of graduation 
be granted before the twelith school year is finished. 
5. That the need for professionally trained teachers to take charge of teacher train- 
ing in high schools and in county normalsis very keenly felt, and hence we urge upon 
institutions engaged in the training of teachers the necessity for their offering suitable 
training for such positions. 5 
6. That we urge upon normal schools, colleges, and universities the reasonableness 
and justice of admitting high-school training-class graduates with rights and privileges 
equal to those extended to other high-school graduates. 
7. That we commend the extension work, the rural school and rural life confer- 
ences, and summer sessions of our normal schools, colleges, universities, and agricul- 
tural schools as a means for the improvement of rural teachers in service, the promo- 
tion of agricultural education, and the betterment of rural life through the home, 
school, and church. 
8. That the training of teachers for the rural schools should be such that they will 
be fitted to utilize the boys’ and girls’ home-project work as a means of motivating 
the industrial, social, and educational life of the school, the home, and the com- 
munity. 
9. That the use of the public schoolhouse as a civic center should be correlated 
with its use for children’s instruction in both country and town. * * * Werecom- 
mend that when the public schoolhouse becomes the polling place and civic forum . 
of the community the school principal, or other responsible employee of the school 
board associated with the school principal, be authorized to serve as the civic secre- 
tary of the community and made responsible for the systematic organization and di- 
rection of all of the uses of the public-school property. We further recommend that 
the administrative organization necessary for the systematic development of the use 
of the public-school buildings and grounds as civic, social, and recreation centers be 
incorporated with and made a part of the work of the departments of public-school 
administration in city, county, and State. 
10.* * * That we request the Commissioner of Education to call this conference 
in annual session from year to year as a clearing house for information to guide usin a 
nation-wide campaign now begun, which we pledge ourselves to continue through the 
best agencies possible until there shall be a sufficient number of properly trained 
teachers for the rural schools of the United States. 
The conference was unanimous also in making the plea of J. Ster- 
ling Morton for professionally trained teachers the platform on 
which to wage a national campaign for professionally trained teach- 
ers for the rural schools of the United States: 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
RURAL EDUCATION. ~ 105 
We demand professionally trained teachers, men and women of irreproachable 
character and well-tested abilities. We demand from our legislature laws raising the 
standard of the profession and exalting the office of the teacher. As the doctor of 
medicine or the practitioner at law is only admitted within the pale of his calling 
upon the production of his parchment or certificates, so the applicant for the position 
of instructor in our primary and other schools should be required by law to first pro- 
duce his diploma, his authority to teach, from the normal schools. 
We call no uneducated quack or charlatan to perform surgery upon the bodies of our 
children, lest they may be deformed, crippled, and maimed physically all theiz lives. 
Let us take equal care that we intrust the development of the mental faculties to 
skilled instructors of magnanimous character that the mentalities of our children may 
not be mutilated, deformed, and crippled, to halt and limp through all the centuries 
of their never-ending lives. The deformed body will die, and be forever put out of 
sight under the ground, but a mind made monstrous by bad teaching dies not, but 
stalks forever among the ages, an immortal mockery of the divine image.    
IL. In public high schools.—Teacher training in public high schools 
was not only indorsed by the two conferences already mentioned, 
but also by the Southern Education Association and the Confer- 
ence for Education in the South at Louisville, Ky., in April, 1914. 
It was the consensus of opinion among those at the conferences 
most deeply interested in the problem of the rural teacher that 
teacher training in public high schools is one of the most effective, 
economic, and popular agencies available. Maryland and Ohio 
established teacher training in their public high schools by legislative 
act in 1914; Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia are the 
Southern States that had already taken up the work. In the New 
England States, Vermont is leading in teacher training in her high 
schools; Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, 
and Wisconsin are the States of the Central West that have had 
teacher training in their public high schools for some years. As other 
States are now seriously considering this policy as a means of pro- 
viding professionally trained teachers for the rural schools, it seems 
fitting to review this subject at this time. 
Teacher training in high schools is not a new thing; it was estab- 
lished by legislative act in New York State as long ago as 1827, or 
12 years before the establishment of the first State normal school in 
America at Lexington, Mass., and in the last 25 years New York has 
appropriated $100,000 annually for this work. Practically all the 
laws on this subject in other States have been patterned after the 
New York act. In all of the States making a success of this work, 
it has been found necessary to have State aid for its support. The 
appropriation in such States is from $50,000 to $100,000 annually. 
Those who are opposed to teacher training in high schools usually 
base their argument upon the theory that it will lower the standard 
of scholarship and professional training, and that high-school pupils 
are not sufficiently mature to profit by a study of pedagogy. Yet in 
practice, according to President D. W. Hayes, of the State Normal

School, Peru, Nebr.,! it would seem that about 50 per cent of the 
State normal-school men of the United States are of the opinion that 
a standard of four years’ work beyond the eighth grade is too high a 
minimum requirement in the preparation of teachers for the rural 
schools by the State normal schools at the present time. On this 
point President Hayes said: 
It is a well-known fact that the ideal course advocated by the normal schools for 
the elementary teacher in the grades is four years beyond the completion of the 
twelfth-grade high school. Yet only about one-half of the normal schools reporting 
seem to feel that it is practicable to require the equivalent of a high-school course to 
fit one to teach in the country. It seems to me that the position of the normal school 
should be either to lower our standards of ideals for the requirements of the elementary 
teacher in the graded schools, or else to raise our ideal of the qualifications to be 
required of the teacher of the rural school. The following represents the situation 
to-day: A teacher is considered qualified to teach a boy in the country school if she 
has, on an average, completed two years beyond the eighth grade. But she is not 
good enough to teach the same boy if he happens to be attending school in the grades 
in a city school, unless she has had six years’ preparation beyond the eighth grade. 
Again, the teacher whom we recognize as qualified to teach the eighth-grade boy in 
the country, if she has completed two years’ work beyond the eighth grade, is not 
considered qualified to teach this same boy in the ninth grade in the city unless she 
has had eight years’ preparation beyond the elementary schools. This is one of the 
greatest inconsistencies of which the normal-school men, college men, and other 
educators, are guilty to-day. 
As further indication of the theory and practice of State normal- 
school men in the preparation of teachers for the rural schools, the 
following statement is taken from a paper, ‘‘The work of the normal 
schools:in the training of teachers for the rural schools,’ read by 
President David Felmley, of the Illinois State Normal University, 
before the first national conference on teacher training for rural 
schools at Chicago in September, 1914: 
It is probably true that up to the close of the last century the notion generally 
prevailed that country-school teachers do not need a specific training different from 
that given to city teachers. In fact, in the older normal schools, the idea usually 
prevailed that, if the teachers were properly instructed in the principles of education 
and in methods of instruction in the various subjects, he could adapt himself to any 
situation in which he might find himself. Primary teachers, grammar-grade teachers, 
country-school teachers, and even prospective high-school teachers all went into the 
same hopper. Of late years we have come to recognize that the field of education 
is too vast for any one to master all its details and that the normal-school course should 
contain a great deal of the details of subject matter and instruction in the particular 
grade or special field in which the teacher is to work. Thus we have, in the normal 
school at Normal, at present, 16 different programs of study arranged for teachers of 
different preparation or for the different destinations which they propose toreach. We 
have come to recognize that the country school presents its own peculiar problems 
of organization and management and in the maierial of its course of study. Accord- 
ingly, we established, with the advent of Miss Mabel Carney into our faculty, a dis-

tinct country-school department with two programs of study, a program two years in 
length for graduates of the eighth grade, who-are not less than 16 years of age when 
they enter the normal school, and a second program one year in length for students 
who have had at least two years of high-school work before entering the normal school. 
These students are taught in all subjects in separate classes, and the teacher in every 
class arranges his work, his material, and illustrations with special reference to country- 
school conditions. 
President John W. Cook, of the Northern Illinois State Normal 
School, in the report of his survey, made in November, 1914, of the 
State normal schools of Alabama, strongly recommended to the presi- 
dents, faculties, and boards of trustees of these schools that courses 
in pedagogy for rural teachers should be administered with the idea 
that many of their students will leave the normal schools to become 
teachers even at the end of the freshman year and each year there- 
after in greater numbers than will graduate in the senior year. He 
urged such a policy not only for the sake of these immature teachers 
and the children that would come under their instruction, but for the 
reputation of the normal schools as well; that these institutions would 
become known among the people by the success or failure of those 
who would leave the normal schools at the end of the freshman year 
even more than by the record made in the schools by their senior 
graduates. One of the features of these courses, he said, should be 
the State course of study prescribed for the rural schools; this should 
be gone over with the thought that the students are to teach the 
subjects of this course, and they should be thoroughly drilled in 
details of the subject matter and the method of presentation; that 
the effectiveness of the prescribed work in pedagogy will depend on 
the manner in which it shall be outlined and organized; that the 
criticism ordinarily to be made upon work described as pedagogical 
is that it lacks very greatly definiteness and simplicity; it usually 
overshoots the pupils, or requires on their part a modification and 
adaptation necessary to make it of practical value; that it is idle to 
tall akout a profession of teaching if such a term is to indicate more 
than 10 per cent of those now engaged as teachers in our public 
schools. President Cook’s perpetual injunction to teachers of peda- 
gogy in the ordinary work of State normal schools is simplicity, 
simplicity, simplicity. 
Those who favor teacher-training courses in public high schools 
make the minimum requirement the same as that stated in resolution 
4 of the First National Conference on Teacher Training for Rural 
Schools,t namely, the completion of a four-year high-school course 
of study above the eighth grade, with the junior and senior years 
modified by a review of the common branches and at least one semes- 
ter in pedagogy, school organization, and school management, with

some observation and practice work. If Presidents Hayes, Felmley, 
and Cook correctly represent the normal-school men of the country 
in the minimum requirements of the State normal schools in the 
preparation of teachers for rural schools, it is evident that teacher 
training in high schools is not a lowering of the standard of scholar- 
ship or of professional training, but in fact a raising of the standard 
in all States giving teacher training in high schools of at least one 
year and, in many States, a raising of the standard of from two to 
three years. 
According to the report of the board of trustees of the State 
normal schools of Alabama to the legislature January, 1915,1 80 per 
cent of the teachers of that State have never attended a normal school 
even fora day. Yet this State has four A-class State normal schools 
and two B-class State normal schools. The number of new white 
teachers needed in the schools of this State each year is at least 1,500, 
and of this number 1,200 begin teaching with no professional training 
of any kind. In the light of these conditions, this same report comes 
out strongly in its recommendation to the legislature for teacher 
training in the public high schools of Alabama. 
In the amount of money appropriated for teacher training, the 
number of public high schools recognized for this work, and the num- 
ber of persons pursuing teacher-training courses during the past year 
Nebraska offers an instance of actual progress in the preparation of 
teachers for the rural schools. There are now 176 public high schools 
and six academies giving normal training in this State. The enroll- 
ment of students in this work during 1913-14 was 3,850 in the junior 
and senior years of four-year high-school courses above the eighth 
grade. The 1913 session of the Nebraska Legislature increased the 
appropriation for teacher training in its high schools from $100,000 
to $125,000 for the biennium. 
State Supt. James E. Delzell, in his biennial report to the State 
legislature dated January 7, 1915, has the following to say in favor of 
normal training in high schools in Nebraska: 
At the last session of our legislature the value of this work to the State and its bearing 
upon the development of the highest type of citizenship through education was fully 
discussed, after which the appropriation was increased from $100,000 to $125,000, thus 
indicating the views of men who give careful attention to the real needs of the people. 
No other appropriation of an equal amount has done so much for the betterment of the 
rural schools. 
The interest in and the enthusiasm for the work so general throughout the State 
comes from the real test as shown by the results already attained even in the short 
time that normal training has been operative. Our normal schools, filled to their 
capacity, are yet unable to supply a sufficient number of teachers for the grades of 
the city and town schools. This leaves the high school our greatest source of supply 
for teachers for rural schools. Our rural schools must continue to be supplied with 
teachers, very largely, by the high schools.

  RURAL EDUCATION, 109 
The progress made in teacher training for rural schools in the high 
schools of Kansas during the past year rivals that of Nebraska. For 
the school year 1912-13, 189 high schools and academies located in 
92 different counties of the State offered teacher-training work and 
had an enrollment in the teacher-training classes of 2,500 junior, 
senior, and postgraduate students. For the school year 1913-14 
there were 195 high schools and academies approved for teacher 
training for rural schools, with 3,500 junior, senior, and postgraduate 
students in their teacher-training classes. 
The progress made in the work of the teacher-training classes in 
the high schools of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin was 
greater during the school year 1913-14 than during any previous 
year. Minnesota signalized this work by calling Miss Mabel Carney 
from the head of the country school department of the Illinois State 
Normal University to the position of State supervisor of teacher- 
training departments in public high schools. Missouri did not begin 
this work until 1913, but it has been a success there from its inaugu- 
ration. 
Nevada has no regular State normal schools, but there is a normal 
department for the training of teachers in the State university, at 
Reno. The population is scattered, however; the great distance to 
be traveled makes attendance at the university almost impossible 
for those who live in the remote sections; and a system of teacher 
training in connection with county high schools is successfully car- 
ried on. The State furnishes the money to pay the salary of the 
normal training teacher—from $1,500 to $1,800 annually—the county 
high-school board supplies room and furniture, and the county com- 
missioners furnish other necessary equipment from a special county 
levy made for the purpose. The State board of education selects 
the teachers, and those in service have high qualifications. There 
must be at least five students desirous of taking the course, who shall 
be either graduates of a four-year high-school course or shall hold an 
elementary school certificate to teach in the State. The county high 
school board must apply to the State board of education, and show 
willingness and ability to furnish proper surroundings and comply 
with other requirements before consent is given for the formation of 
a county normal class. 
It is worth noting that some men who, as presidents of State normal 
schools, were not enthusiastic over teacher training in high schools, 
later as State superintendents, with the responsibility of supplying 
their rural schools with properly qualified teachers, have become 
ardent advocates of this policy in the training of teachers for rural 
schools. Experience has shown that this policy has increased the 
attendance at State normal schools, giving these institutions students 
of college rank rather than pupils of high-school grade, and has
-P-A-G-E-148
  110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
actually brought about in some States the establishment of more 
public normal schools. President John Kirk, speaking for Missouri, 
says that for a short time following the establishment of teacher- 
training classes in high schools the attendance of pupils of high-school 
grade has decreased at one or two State normal schools, but he con- 
fidently predicts that ultimately the attendance will be increased 
atsuch schools. This increased attendance, President Kirk declares, 
will be of college rank, rather than of high-school grade. 
State Supt. C. P. Cary is authority for the statement that some 
principals of county normals in Wisconsin oppose the establishment 
of teacher-training courses in the high schools of that State, but he 
says it will not be many years before every county in Wisconsin has 
either a county normal school or at least one public high school with 
a teacher-training course, except in the counties having State normal 
schools. 
Dr. Thomas E. Finegan, assistant commissioner of education for 
elementary schools in the State of New York, said at the Chicago con- 
ference that, while the teacher-training classes in over 100 high 
schools of New York State had for nearly a century been practically 
the only source for supplying the rural schools with professionally 
trained teachers, he was not satisfied with the qualifications of teach- 
ers thus prepared. New York has 10 State normal schools and 12 
city normal schools, but rarely is a graduate from either of this class 
of schools found as a teacher in the rural schools of New York. It 
is Dr. Finegan’s hope that within the next decade New York State 
will establish at least 10 State normal schools in rural sections of the 
State, whose sole purpose it will be to train teachers for the rural 
schools. If Dr. Finegan’s hopes are realized, it will prove one of the 
arguments of those who favor teacher training in high schools that, in 
addition to its immediate service in supplying the rural schools with 
better teachers, it is also a factor in general rural-school progress. 
If this policy in the training of teachers can be as effectively used in 
those States that are now without it as it has been in New York and 
other States, it will bring progress in rural education in States that are 
now near the foot of the list. The advance made in rural education 
in those States having teacher training in their high schools is far 
greater than in those that have made no use of this agency. 
Ill. Rural-school extension in State normal schools.—Rural-school 
extension is becoming an important agency by which the State normal 
schools may render great service in training rural teachers, in develop- 
ing rural leaders, and in promoting rural welfare. Modern opinion 
holds that a thorough and systematic organization in rural extension 
work should be established in every State normal school; that each 
school should have a man peculiarly fitted for this work in the field 
practically all the time; that this agent should visit the high schools in
-P-A-G-E-149
  RURAL EDUCATION. 117} 
the territory of his institution for the purpose of interesting in the work 
of the State normal schools those with a natural aptness for teaching; 
that he should plan correspondence courses of study in those subjects in 
which such work can be carried on successfully; visit the graduates of 
his school to help them in their actual teaching; advise with patrons 
and school officers as to the best ways and means for the improvement 
of their schools; assist teachers in the proper direction of the boys’ and 
girls’ industrial clubs; and be a leader who is in deep sympathy with 
rural life bettermentin allits phases. Itis gratifying to find that many 
State normal schools have already realized the value of such extension 
work and have done things worth while during the past year in this 
field of service. 
An excellent example of extensive and successful work in rural- 
school extension, as well as in the training of teachers for the 
rural schools, was that of the Iowa State Teachers College at Cedar 
Falls. By the authority of the Iowa State Board of Education there 
is established at the Iowa State Teachers College a department of 
rural teacher training. This department consists of the president, 
the head of the department of instruction in education, the head of 
the department of teacher training, three professors of rural educa- 
tion, all instructors of all organized departments who give instruc- 
tion in any of the scholastic branches assigned to the rural teachers’ 
course, and 10 teachers of superior grade who are in charge of the 
10 rural demonstration schools which are under the direction and 
supervision of the State Teachers College. 
The rural teachers’ course consists of all the branches required by 
law for first-grade uniform county certificate, including such industrial 
branches as agriculture, home economics, manual training, and such 
professional subjects as elementary psychology, school management 
and primary methods, and country education problems. This course 
includes one month’s continuous teaching in one of the rural demon- 
stration schools under the supervision of a supervisor of rural educa- 
tion and the direction of the critic teachers regularly in charge of the 
rural demonstration schools who have been specially selected for their 
qualifications to do this work. These subordinate critics in teaching 
are paid $700 a year, part of the salary coming from the State. 
The three professors of rural. educatio% give the instruction in 
education to the students in the course and hold biweekly meetings 
of the students to discuss country: problems under the title “The 
Iowa Club.” At this club meeting the students have a large part of 
the program. Only those enrolled in the club are permitted to attend. 
In addition, they hold monthly meetings of the citizens of each dis- 
trict and supervise the industrial work of every child outside of school 
hours.  
-P-A-G-E-150
  112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The present graduating class consists of 50 members, and is the 
result of the second year’s work in this special line. When the 
students graduate they receive a diploma entitled “The Rural 
Teacher Diploma,” and they are granted a State certificate by the 
State board of education examiners entitled “The Rural State Cer- 
~ tificate.” They are privileged to teach under this authority in any 
school where they are able to secure employment. 
For the teachers in the service of the schools, the Iowa State 
Teachers College has established 50 study centers for Saturday 
instruction. These study centers will enroll about 3,000 active teach- 
ers. The work is definitely presented in printed circulars; the teach- 
ers are required to attend meetings by the agreement that was made 
when the study center was organized, and they are strictly held to 
the assignments made for the lessons. These meetings occur at 
least monthly at the town where the study center is located. Mem- 
bers of the faculty of the college give actual instruction for three 
class hours at each meeting, as many instructors being supplied as 
the size of the study center demands to insure good class work. It 
is expected that smaller groups of the teachers will meet more fre- 
quently under their own organization approved by the county super- 
intendent, in order to confer and discuss these assigned lessons. 
Examinations with credit will finally follow when the teachers are 
later enrolled at the college in summer or regular sessions. 
All the expenses of instruction are paid by the teachers college out 
of its current funds, each instructor receiving for each day’s work 
the same salary he or she receives for teaching the same time on th- 
campus. The expenses of travel and of entertainment for the 
instructors at these study centers are paid by the counties where the 
centers are organized. Twenty-five thousand dollars can be used 
by the teachers college this year in such instruction, if there is demand 
for it, and other instructors not members of the teachers college 
faculty may be employed if their qualifications are such as to assure 
efficiency and acceptability. Last year 1,040 students were thus 
taught, and many of these came to the summer session to complete 
the work they had begun. It is the intention of the State board of 
education to extend the summer term to a full 12 weeks’ session, in 
order to give those stud&nts enrolled in teacher study centers an 
opportunity to complete courses and graduate from the teacliers 
college. 
Several other State normal schools in various sections of the coun- 
try have done successful extension work in rural education, as well 
as for the benefit of adults in various school communities. Typical 
examples are the Middle Tennessee State Normal School at Murfrees- 
boro, the West Tennessee State Normal School at Memphis, and the 
Eastern State Normal School at Johnson City. 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  RURAL EDUCATION, 113 
The Middle Tennessee State Normal School has been doing exten- 
sion work through the county institutes for some time. This year, 
however, it has planned a little more systematic work than hereto- 
fore. The same instructor visits a county at each of its monthly 
teachers’ meetings, and does continuous work for the whole year in 
the special subject assigned for this county. Definite work is pre- 
scribed at each meeting for the teachers to pursue during the month. 
In one county literature for the grades is studied for the entire year; 
in another, art in the schoolroom, with special stress placed upon the 
educative value of pictures; in a third, the study of the problems and 
difficulties peculiar to the one-room rural school; in a fourth, history 
for the grades; in a fifth, agriculture, with special reference to rural- 
life problems; in a sixth, in conjunction with the State rural-school 
agents, an education survey of the county is under way. 
There are about a dozen counties on its list this year in which about 
1,500 teachers are reached once a month. The good results of this 
work may be summed up as follows: 
1. The normal-school men themselves have an opportunity to study educational 
conditions at first hand in various counties of the State, and are thereby better prepared 
for the work they are to do. 
2. An opportunity is furnished for serving directly the teachers who may never have 
achance to attend the normal school and to aid in the solution of vital school problems. 
3. The infiuence of the school is extended beyond the limits of the campus, and it 
becomes an instrument of service for the whole people. 
4, It helps to increase the attendance at the normal school, and thereby enlarges 
its usefulness. 
The extension work for adults at the West Tennessee State Normal 
School consists of a series of meetings at country schoolhouses. Four 
or five instructors are sent to a school for each meeting. They pre- 
sent various subjects connected with the home, farm, and school life 
of the community. The professor of agriculture presents a varied 
line of subjects dealing with farm interests; the biology teacher those 
dealing with school sanitation and hygiene; the domestic science 
teacher, cooking demonstrations; and the English teacher, the sub- 
ject of home reading for children and adults. 
Recently President Sidney G. Gilbreath, of the East Tennessee State 
Normal School, sent out a list of questions to the 34 county superin- 
tendents of east Tennessee on school conditions and growth for the 
period beginning October 1, 1913, and ending October 1, 1914. Com- 
plete reports have been received from all the county superintendents, 
showing substantial progress for the period covered by the questions. 
For the year covered by the report, October, 1913, to October, 1914, there were 36 
one-room schoolhouses built in east Tennessee. In only 3 counties, Bledsoe, Monroe, 
and Morgan, was this type of house exclusively favored. All other counties that 
erected any new schoolhouses erected at least one or more that contained more than 
73226°—xp 1914—voL 1——8  
-P-A-G-E-152
114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
one room; 54 two-room houses were erected; 17 three-room houses; and 33 Houses each: 
containing four or more rooms. 
The amount spent for new buildings, for repairs, and furnishings aggregated for the 
period given $304,541. It is a healthy sign of progress when more two-room houses 
are built than one-room houses; and when nearly as many houses containing four or 
more rooms are erected as one-room houses. 
In the matter of expenditures for schoolhouses, Greene County heads the list, report- 
ing an expenditure of $75,000 for the year. 
Nine counties voted bonds for school-building purposes to the total amount of 
$494,800. The nine counties voting bonds were Bradley, Campbell, Greene, Ss 
ton, Hawkins, Johnson, Knox, Polk, and Roane. 
The reports show that 74 supervisors and demonstrators were employed in 19 of the 
384 counties, 15 counties not yet employing such school agents. 
All of the counties except Grainger, Hamblen, Sevier, Sullivan, Unicoi, and Union 
reported a high-school tax. In only one county, Washington, was the tax levy for 
elementary and high schools decreased; all the other counties have the same rate as 
the preceding year except Campbell, Claiborne, Grainger, Greene, Hancock, Hawkins, 
Loudon, Polk, and Roane, which show a substantial increase, the average levy for 
county elementary schools, including the State tax, being 46 cents on the $100, and 
for high schools 12 cents on the $100 for the 28 counties maintaining high schools. 
The reports further showed that 428 libraries had been established or aided, the 
amount collected in the counties as library funds amounting to $7,845. very county 
except Meigs reported library aid. In the number of libraries aided or established, 
Knox County easily heads the list, with 100 libraries aided at a cost of $1,500. 
Of the 34 counties, 30 report attendance as much better than for the preceding year. 
Two, Meigs and Washington, report a smaller attendance; and two, Sevier and Bledsoe, 
report the same attendance as for 1913. 
In respect to the efficiency of the teaching force, 28 report decided improvement, 5 
report no gain, and 1 does not answer the question. 
The State normal schools at Troy, Jacksonville, and Florence, Ala., 
each have a rural demonstration school, which is used much like the 
demonstration schools in connection with the State Teachers’ College 
at Cedar Falls, Iowa, already described. Wherever feasible and 
possible, a normal school that attempts to prepare teachers for rural 
schools should have within easy transportation distance a typical 
rural school for observation purposes and also for the purpose of 
affording a practice school for its pupil teachers. 
The State Normal School at Lewiston, Idaho, has made a valuable 
contribution toward a solution of the problem in teacher training for 
rural schools. 
The State Normal School at Monmouth, Oreg., has also done good 
work in teacher training for rural schools. While this institution as 
yet has no rural schools for practice teaching, it has two typical rural 
schools that are used for observation purposes. Frequent visits are 
made to these schools by the prospective rural teachers, under the 
direction of the one in charge of rural education at the normal school. 
That the teacher may be fitted to meet the difficulties which confront

the teacher of the one-room rural school, she is given a course dealing 
with rural school problems. 
The Western State Normal School, at Bowling Green, Ky., during 
the late summer and early fall of 1913 conducted a series of farmers’ 
chautauquas in the rural communities, villages, towns, and cities of 
Warren County. There were four chautauquas beginning on Sunday 
morning and closing Wednesday evening, five one-day chautauquas, 
and a greater Warren County convention which closed the program 
for the year at Bowling Green with an old-time barbecue attended by 
over 5,000 people from the rural communities. Senator Robert M. 
La Follette was the principal speaker at the Bowling Green conven- 
tion. The purpose of these chautauquas was to create better senti- 
ment for good citizenship and to improve the moral, intellectual, 
and industrial life of the people. They formed a farmers’ school, 
where all of the people—old and young, boys and girls—attended and 
studied the problems of the community. It is the belief of President 
Cherry, who inaugurated this work, that the community becomes a 
working organism almost entirely through the spontaneous life of 
the people, and that this spontaneous life depends largely upon 
uniform progress and equal opportunity for every citizen; that if we 
look the world over for an easy way to build up a great community, 
in the end we find that it exists in the life of the people composing 
the community; it grows because it has the contagion of good citizen- 
ship; because it is itself a great lesson in progressive life; because its 
citizens, its public sentiment, its ideal, its patriotism are aggressive, 
moral, and just. 
The programs of each chautauqua were built upon the needs of the 
community. The local committees were asked to assist in selecting 
the subjects and the local speakers. It was frequently announced 
before the assembly that the entire community was on the program, 
and all were urged to participate in the round-table discussions. 
Frequently an expert, representing some department of rural uplift, 
would speak for 20 or 30 minutes, and then would be kept busy for 
more than an hour, answering questions asked by the people of the 
community. The program covered practically all the matters con- 
nected with the development of country life. The religious life of 
the community, household economy, the consolidation of small 
country schools, practical agriculture, corn culture, hog cholera, 
alfalfa, dairying, silos, the poultry business, live-stock raising, fruit 
growing, methods of crop cultivation, soil improvement and con- 
servation, sanitary water supply, beautifying country homes, good 
toads and road building, rural hygiene and sanitary science, markets 
for farm products, farmers’ cooperative unions, parcel posts, and 
many other subjects were discussed.

  116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
THE COUNTY UNIT. 
The greatest interest in any one problem of rural education during 
the past year was manifested in the county-unit organization for the 
administration of rural schools. It was indorsed by the State super- 
intendents of public instruction at a meeting held at St. Paul, Minn., 
in July, 1914, and by the National Education Association in general 
session there at the same time. The legislatures of 10 or more 
States have had this policy under consideration in their 1915 sessions. 
The essentials of the county-unit basis of organization for the 
administration of rural schools have been stated as follows:* 
1. The county as the unit of taxation and administration of schools (except that, in 
administration, independent city districts employing a superintendent would not be 
included). 
2. A county-school tax levied on all taxable property in the county, covered into 
the county treasury, and divided between the independent city districts and the 
rest of the county on a basis of the school population. 
8. The county-school funds, including those raised by taxation and those received 
from the State, expended in such a way as would as nearly as possible insure equal 
educational opportunities in all parts of the county, regardless of the amount raised 
in any particular part. (Any subdistrict should be permitted to raise, by taxation 
or otherwise, additional funds to supplement the county funds, provided the sub- 
district desired a better school plant, additional equipment, or a more efficient teach- 
ing force than could be provided from the county funds.) 
4. A county board of education, in which is vested the administration of the public 
schools of the county (except those in independent city districts), composed of from 
five to nine persons, elected or appointed from the county at large; the board to be 
nonpartisan; the term of office to be at least five years; and the terms arranged so 
that not more than one-fifth would expire in any one year. 
5. A county superintendent of schools, a professional educator, selected by the 
county board of education, from within or without the county or State, for a long term 
(at least two years), who shall serve as the secretary and executive officer of the county 
board and as such be the recognized head of the public schools in the county (except 
those in independent city districts). 
6. District trustees in each subdistrict of the county, one or more persons, elected 
by the voters of the district or selected by the county board, to be custodians of the 
school property and to serve in an advisory capacity to the county board. The 
expenditures of local funds raised by the subdistrict would rest with the trustees, 
subject to the approval of the county board. 
7. The powers and duties of the county board of education: 
(a) To select a county superintendent, who would be its secretary and executive 
officer in the performance of all of its other functions, and to appoint assistants 
as required. 
(0) To have general control and management of the schools of the county. 
(c) To submit estimates to the regular county taxing authority of the amount of 
money needed to support the schools. 
(d) To regulate the boundaries of the school subdistricts of the county, making from 
time to time such alterations as in its judgment would serve the best interests 
of the county system. 
(e) To locate and erect school buildings. 
(f) To supply the necessary equipment.

-P-A-G-E-155
  RURAL EDUCATION, 117 
(g) To fix the course of study and select textbooks (using the State course and State- 
adopted textbooks in the States where action has been’ taken). 
(h) To enforce the compulsory-education laws. 
(i) To employ teachers, fix their salaries, and the salaries of other employees. 
The county is the unit of supervision in at least 39 States of the 
Union and some form of county control of schools is now found in 18 
States. The district unit of organization is in practice in 28 States. 
Investigation shows that county control has been adopted by most 
of the Southern States, while the district is the unit of organization 
in most of the States west of the Mississippi River. In the New 
England States, where cities and incorporated towns are included in 
the township, and where the township is the unit of local taxation 
and local government in nearly all civil affairs, ‘township control 
has proved very satisfactory.” 
Where conditions are not exceptional, as in New England, county 
control recommends itself because it is already the unit of super- 
vision in most of the States; it gives the schools better support by 
giving the entire county the benefit of taxes paid by corporations, 
such as railroads; it gives the schools better teachers with better 
salaries, yet the schools are run more economically; it removes the 
school from unwise local influences and gives opportunity for the 
selection of teachers from a wider range and upon their merits; and 
it injects business into the management of the schools. 
President N. D. Showalter, of the State Normal School, Cheney, 
Wash., makes the following argument against the county unit: 
We are growing toward a ‘‘greater democracy” each year, and any plan proposed 
for the improvement of our educational system, which at the same time takes out of 
the hands of the people that which is most sacred to them—upon any pretext what- 
soever—should at once be labeled as un-American. 
Nothing is worth while which has not behind it a great living personality, and no 
institution can prosper without human sympathy, and a united personal interest. 
Personal interest, however, is limited and can only come in contact in the strongest 
way with conditions near at hand. Impressions that we receive each day con- 
cerning the things which are nearest and dearest to us become of greatest personal 
interest... *2 *.* 
The local community ought to be interested most in its own local affairs, and ought 
to know its own needs, its own possibilities, better than those who view it from a 
distance. It ought to be willing to make greater sacrifice for local needs than those 
who are looking on from afar. It certainly has a right to be considered, in a personal 
way, when anything is proposed as a safe principle for it to follow. 
To propose that we (appointed agents) know better how to administer to the needs 
of the people than they know how to provide for their own well-being is nothing 
more than an old antiquated theory. It will work out in practice only when such 
agents are directly responsible to the people, and subject to their suggestion and 
direction. It is not what we can do for others that counts, but rather how much we 
can get them to do for themselves. The larger centers, therefore, can furnish sug- 
gestion and inspiration; but in order for any principle to become permanent, it must 
be wrought out and finally approved by the smaller units, and must through the 
course of time prove to be practical in connection with their needs and to their 
progress.

118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Hon. Nathan C. Schaeffer, State superintendent of public instruc~ 
tion of Pennsylvania, gives his position on the county unit: 
When our common-school system was organized we found we could not get schools 
on a county plan. The township was adopted, and there has been no agitation for 
acounty unit. The States south of Mason and Dixon’s line have a different political 
organization from the States north of that line. * * * 
Yesterday Mr. C: was in my office and advocated the obliteration of township 
lines in school matters. As soon as he discovers that such a plan will increase his 
taxes he will be against the plan. Unfortunately township lines were not run with 
an idea to public school administration, but the same is true of county lines. We 
have the county unit in school supervision, and it is too large.   
Pennsylvania has a statute providing for a district school officers’ 
convention at public expense in each county annually and a State 
school officers’ meeting once a year. Anyone who has attended 
one of these county conventions, like those held in Allegheny and 
Berks Counties in December, 1914, and witnessed the interest and 
enthusiasm of these officers, over 350 at each meeting, in all matters 
pertaining to the improvement of the rural schools, naturally ques- 
tions the wisdom of changing from this system to one that would 
reduce the number of active school officers in a county to a small 
board of from 5 to 10 members, thereby losing the influence and 
interest of over 350 wide-awake men in the school affairs of a single 
county. If this interest and influence be multiplied by the number 
of counties in Pennsylvania. for its State-wide effect, it is not hard 
to see why Supt. Schaeffer dislikes to lose the help of 20,000 men in 
the cause of popular education. 
As chairman ex officio of the committee on rural schools, Dr. 
Schaeffer made the following report to the Pennsylvania State 
Educational Association, December 29, 1914, on The County v. 
The Township as the unit of taxation and school administration: 
Pennsylvania tried a county plan in 1834 and 1835 and changed to the township 
plan in 1836. From more than 100 townships independent districts were carved 
so as to permit more rapid progress in school matters. As conditions have greatly 
changed since 1836, it is deemed wise to discuss The County v. The Township as 
the unit of taxation and school administration. Moreover, in the Southern States, 
where the county is the prevailing unit, the educational leaders are trying to secure 
local taxation, whilst in Pennsylvania ‘some are now advocating county taxes for 
school maintenance in order to get away from local taxation. 
I. The county unit of rural school administration presupposes a county board of 
education with powers corresponding to those ordinarily possessed by township and 
city boards and a county superintendent of schools responsible to the county board 
with powers and duties corresponding to those of city superintendents. The most 
efficient organization presupposes a small board selected from the county at large 
and the selection of the county superintendent of this board without reference to the 
place of residence. Following are the chief considerations favoring the county unit: 
1. The civil division corresponding to our county is the unit of rural school adminis- 
tration in the leading educational countries of Europe, viz, the Regierungs-Bezirk 
in Germany, the Department in France, and the administrative county in England. 
In England the county unit was substituted for the parish or township unit in 1902. 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  RURAL EDUCATION. 119 
® 
2. The county has long proved to be a satisfactory unit in certain of our Southern 
States. 
3. The burdens and opportunities of education can be equalized throughout the 
entire county. The tax rate can be made uniform, and all communities, rich and 
poor, can be provided with the same minimum educational advantages. 
4, Schools may be provided and attendance districts established on the basis of 
topography, distribution of population, etc., regardless of township or other arbitrary 
lines. In this way the effective consolidation of schools may be much facilitated. 
5. A reasonable degree of uniformity in school year, curriculum, methodology, 
textbooks, etc., may be secured throughout the county, thus obviating most of the 
waste and misadjustment resulting from migration within the county when the town- 
ship is the unit. 
6. The county unit requires the time and services of far fewer lay school officials. 
7. A county board of education with adequate powers is likely to be made up of 
men of much better caliber than the average of township boards. The greater import- 
ance and prestige of membership on the county board and the selection irom the entire 
county favor this result. It is a matter of experience that members of purely local 
school boards are likely to be relatively ignorant, prejudiced, and parsimonious. 
8. The county unit is more favorable to efficiency of administration and supervision 
of rural schools. The county can afford the services of a professional leader or super- 
intendent of superior caliber, whereas the townships can not. Under the county unit 
the direction oi all local administration and supervision can be placed in the hands 
of such a professional county leader. 
9. The county unit is more favorable to efficiency of teaching. Owing to the com- 
mon limitations of purely local authorities, the selection, control, and supervision of 
teachers by county authorities is very likely to result in better conditions of tenure, 
higher qualifications, and in general better teaching. 
10. For like reasons the county unit is more favorable to securing proper material, 
sanitary and other correct physical conditions of school work. 
11. In general the advantages usually carried by the present general movement 
toward greater centralization of educational administration result from the adoption 
of the county unit in place of the township unit. 
II. The township unit of rural school administration is the one in vogue in the State 
of Pennsylvania. Following are the chief considerations favoring the township unit: 
1. The township has long proved to be a satisfactory unit in our New England 
States and a few others. 
2. The township unit harmonizes better with the instinct and desire of the American 
people for local self-government. 
3. The township unit is conducive to greater local interest and initiative in matters 
educational. In securing these advantages the multiplicity of local lay school offi- 
cials is very desirable. 
4, The township unit is more just from the standpoint of taxation and support. 
Complete equalization of the burden of education is unfair. Every community 
should bear a considerable part of its own educational burdens without assistance. 
5. The township unit is more favorable to the adaptation of education to local needs. 
Variation to suit local conditions is educationally desirable, as well as reasonable 
uniformity. 
6. In general the advantages usually carried by local autonomy in educational 
administration are secured through the use of the township unit rather than the county 
unit. 
7. As arule the township unit corresponds more closely to established practice in 
America and involves less change and readjustment than the other. This argument 
of course applies with full force to Pennsylvania. 
*From the exceptions that can be cited against proper conditions 
under any of the three systems—district, township, or county— 
it is evident that the greatest need in this country for real progress 
in rural education is a public sentiment that will vote the amount 
of funds necessary for a first-class school within reasonable distance 
of every child of school age. When the weak district has done all 
that reason should ask it to do, then the State should come to its 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
é 
assistance by direct State aid with enough money for nine months 
of school each year and a teacher professionally trained. 
Among the greatest obstacles in the path of rural-school progress 
are partisan politics, factional favoritism, and selfish nepotism, and 
it will take something more than any or all of these three units of 
administration to free our public school system from these evils. It 
often happens that the larger the unit of administration the greater 
the political influence in the management of schools, for even State 
boards of education and boards of control of State educational insti- 
tutions have been guilty of as evil political methods, favoritism, and 
nepotism as the school officers of the smallest unit of administration 
found in the public school system of the United States. The only 
remedy for such evils is the creation of a public sentiment that will 
demand that all public school officers, whether elected or appointed, 
whether in charge of a district school, the schools of township, county, 
or State, will make merit the determining force in the selection of 
teachers and public economy their motto in the administration of 
public school funds and yet not be penny-wise and pound-foolish; for 
every dollar wisely expended for public education saves two dollars in 
expenses for jails and prisons. In the management of the public 
schools, whether under the district, township, or county unit, as well 
as in the control of State educational institutions, all distinctions, 
social, political, and religious, should be banished, all differences 
hushed. This management should recognize ‘‘neither party nor 
church, creed, condition, nor station, but it should be so administered 
that its bounties and benefits will fall in equal measure upon all.” 
RURAL-SCHOOL LEGISLATION. 
The rural-school legislation that attracted widest attention during 
the school year of 1913-14 was enacted by a special session of the 
General Assembly of Ohio, when a complete revision of the State 
school code was made. The history of American education does not 
record instances of many States that have held special sessions of 
the legislature solely for the revision of the school laws. The more 
important laws relating to the rural schools enacted by this special 
session of the Ohio General Assembly were as follows: 
1. New rural-school supervision law. Under this act the school districts of the 
State are to be styled, respectively, city-school districts, village-school districts, 
rural-school districts, and county-school districts. 
2. Law on the training of teachers for village and rural schools. Boards of edu- 
cation which maintain first-grade high schools in village or rural districts may estab- 
lish normal departments in such schools for the training of teachers for village and 
rural schools. Not less than one nor more than three such schools shall be estab- 
lished in any county. The superintendent of public instruction is to designate 
schools to establish such departments. 
3. Law basing the distribution of the State school fund on the number of teachers 
and average daily attendance of pupils.
-P-A-G-E-159
  
RURAL EDUCATION. 121 
4. Law on minimum salaries for teachers. No person shall be employed to teach’ 
in any public school in Ohio for less than. $40 a month. When a school district has 
not sufficient money to pay its teachers such salaries for eight months of the year, 
after the board of education of such district has made the maximum legal school 
levy, three-fourths of which shall be for the tuition fund, then such district may 
receive from the State treasurer sufficient money to make up the deficiency. 
5. Law for State aid to weak school districts appropriates the balance of former 
appropriations and the sum of $85,000. 
6. Law providing that agriculture shall be taught in all the common schools of all 
village and rural school districts which are supported in whole or in part by the 
State. It may be taught in city school districts at the option of the board of educa- 
tion. Four district State supervisors of agricultural education are to be appointed 
by the superintendent of public instruction. 
7, Law on standardization of village and rural schools. Instead of examining the 
pupils for admission to high schools, the elementary rural schools from which they. 
come are to be examined in equipment, courses of study provided with competent 
and ever-present supervision, and standardized so that the school and the teacher 
may stand the test as well as the pupil. 
To get a clear understanding of how all this was accomplished, it 
is necessary to know something of the Ohio State school survey 
which preceded this legislation. The story of this survey is given in 
the report to the governor of Ohio by the State school survey com- 
mission, created by an act which passed the general assembly Feb- 
ruary 26, 1913, to conduct a survey of the public schools, normal 
schools, and the agricultural schools of the State. The survey was 
a cooperative field study conducted by Dr. Horace L. Brittain, of 
the New York Training School for Public Service. It comprised an 
intensive study of 659 rural village schools in 88 counties, and an 
extensive study of 9,000 schoolrooms and 395 school systems. It 
was participated in by 44 professors in professional schools for the 
training of teachers and 116 students in these institutions, most of 
whom had had experience in rural teaching, 395 superintendents of 
schools and other school men and women, and 9,000 teachers who 
supplied information for the commission. It was a State-wide 
revival in school matters, as well as a State-wide scientific survey of 
school conditions. Gov. Cox named November 14, 1918, as State 
school-survey day for the entire State. In his proclamation he said: 
“Let it be a day of genuine awakening. The necessity and oppor- 
tunity of the hour call for it.” It is estimated that 4,000 commu- 
nity meetings were held on this date, where probably 500,000 citizens 
of Ohio learned of school conditions throughout the State and 
listened to the remedies suggested for improvement. 
The commission, in its letter of transmittal, says: 
We have tried to make a matter-of-fact statement of the results of our field work. 
Our motto has been: ‘Nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice.’ We 
have taken no pleasure in laying bare deplorable conditions. We believe the simple 
statement of these conditions will do much to bring about the reforms which we urge. 
We have also found much to commend—good teachers, good conditions, and a good 
spirit. On these we must build.

    122 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
FREE TEXTBOOKS. 
Rural schools have been at considerable disadvantage as compared 
with city schools, through lack of free textbooks. In 1913 Missouri 
and Oregon! secured laws permitting the local school authorities to 
adopt the free textbook system. This policy is strongly advocated 
in many States where it has not prevailed hitherto—Florida and 
Louisiana, particularly. State Supt. Harris has recommended, in 
his official report to the Legislature of Louisiana, the enactment of 
a law providing for free public school readers, with special thought 
for the rural schools. In support of this measure he says: 
The most important textbook in the course of study is the reader. I suggest the 
passage of a law which will relieve the children of the State from the necessity of 
buying readers, and requiring each parish school board to furnish at least three sets 
of different readers for each grade and for each public school, from the first grade to 
the fifth, both inclusive. This would furnish ample reading material, and would 
relieve children of the necessity of buying readers. Granting that the life of a reader 
is three years, the annual cost to the State would be between thirty and forty thousand 
dollars. This amount distributed among all of the parishes would not prove a burden, 
I think, to any one parish. 
It can be safely affirmed that wherever proper attention has been 
paid to the administration of the free-textbook law the results have 
been highly satisfactory to school authorities, teachers, and patrons. 
It is, furthermore, safe to assume that having once come to under- 
stand the advantages of this logical extension of the free school idea, 
the people of a State will not willingly go back to the system of pupil 
ownership of school textbooks. In those States that have mandatory 
statutes providing free textbooks this policy has proved a far greater 
success than in the States where it is optional. Free textbooks in 
all the States will remove another handicap which the country dis- 
tricts have had as compared with most cities.” 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND HOME ECONOMICS. 
Evidence of the progress made in agricultural education and home 
economics in the rural schools of the United States for the school 
year 1913-14 is found in the farm life schools of Minnesota, in the 
$100,000 increased appropriation for the county agricultural high 
schools of Mississippi, and in the Smith-Lever Act previously referred 
to. The appropriation under this act begins at $480,000, increasing 
each year until it continues permanently with an annual appropria- 
tion by Congress of $4,580,000. As each State must make an appro- 
priation equal to its share of this sum, it means that, when this act 
is in full operation, over $9,000,000 a year will be available for exten- 
sion work in agricultural education and home economics.

AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOLS. 
1. Minnesota.—An extensive, liberally supported, and successful 
system of agricultural high schools is found in Minnesota. There 
are 176 of these schools—60 Associated Farm Life Schools, and 116 
Consolidated Farm Life Schools, with a total high-school attendance 
of over 30,000 pupils who are pursuing industrial education. 
In addition to a liberal local tax for the support of these schools, 
it is possible for them to receive in the aggregate each year $1,500,000 
direct State aid. There is State aid given to a school (1) as a high 
school; (2) as a consolidated high school; (3) as an associated farm 
life school; (4) as a teacher-training high school; and (5) for indus- 
trial work in agriculture, normal training, and home economics. 
These schools do not stop with the regular instruction of those in 
actual attendance; the extension work is a strong feature, consisting 
of evening schools, correspondence courses, and numerous community 
activities. In brief, these schools are civic, social, industrial, and 
educational centers for their respective communities. 
2. Mississippi.—The State department of education in Mississippi 
secured the passage of an act by the legislature of the State in 1908 
+ authorizing the establishment of county agricultural high schools. 
After several schools had been established and were in operation, 
the Supreme Court of Mississippi declared this act unconstitutional. 
The interest in these schools was so great, however, that they did not 
close their doors. Provision was made through private subscription 
to continue their work until the succeeding legislature might have 
opportunity to meet the constitutional objections. The legislature 
of 1910 passed an act coinciding with the views of the court, and no 
constitutional objection has since presented itself. : 
The county agricultural high schools of Mississippi are supported 
by both the county and the State. The proper taxing authority in 
any county may levy the required tax for the establishment of a 
county agricultural high school upon proper petition signed by a 
certain number of taxpayers and by giving due notice in the county 
papers without submitting the question of voting a tax therefor to 
all of the legal voters in the county, provided that when a petition is 
signed by 10 per cent of the taxpayers of any county protesting 
against such tax, then the question must be submitted to a vote of 
the taxpayers before the tax can be levied and the school established. 
A majority vote decides the question. 
Within the last five years about 45 counties have established these 
schools. As evidence of the increasing interest among the people 
of Mississippi in agricultural education it is sufficient to point to 
the increased appropriation made by the legislature in February,   
1A bulletin on the Minnesota schools is in preparation.  
-P-A-G-E-162
  124 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
1914, for county agricultual high schools—$167,500—an increase of 
$100,000 over that made two years ago. 
In the 45 county agricultural high schools of Mississippi there are 
now nearly 5,000 young men and young women enrolled, 75 per 
cent of whom are from the farm, and over 50 per cent are boarding 
students. 
The attendance of farm boys and farm girls at these schools argues 
eloquently for the county system of agricultural high schools, as com- 
pared with the congressional district system in some other States. 
While these district agricultural high schools would naturally receive 
a larger appropriation for buildings and equipment, they do not 
reach anything like the number of students the county schools would 
benefit. By the time Mississippi has an agricultural high school in 
every county the aggregate attendance in all such schools will be 
over 10,000 students. 
The low cost of board in these schools is probably not equaled in 
any other State. The reasons for this are the climate, which gives 
a garden season the year round, the opportunity given students to pay 
their way in whole or in part by work, and the recognition of the schools 
by the trade as merchant buyers, whereby they get all their supplies 
at wholesale prices. Before giving credit for work done by the 
students, the boys working on the farm and in the garden and the 
girls helping in the kitchen, waiting on table, and assisting in the 
poultry department, the average cost per student is about $6 per 
month. After giving credit for such work, the average cost per 
student is less than $4 per month. 
Room rent is free. In many of these schools the dormitories are 
equipped with electric or acetylene gas, hot and cold water baths, and 
inside toilets. 
Hon. J. H. Powers, former State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, now chancellor of the State university, says: 
I feel safe in saying that not more than 12 per cent of the students enrolled as 
boarders would be in our agricultural high schools were it not for the low cost at which 
they are being educated. 
The material equipment of the school plant is usually an adminis- 
tration building, which includes the recitation rooms, a dormitory 
for girls and a dormitory for boys; a farm properly platted and 
stocked, including barns and farm machinery. The value of these 
plants varies from $15,000 to $50,000, owing to the local donations 
made in order to secure the school and the amount given by the 
county. For example, the farm at Ellisville contains only 40 acres, 
while at Brooklyn it is 320 acres and at Perkinston 575 acres. 
As to the practical things done in all of these schools, good exam- 
ples are found at Ellisville and Poplarville. In Jones County last 
year there was an epidemic of hog eholera. Principal John R.
-P-A-G-E-163

Hutcheson and some of the young men among his students at Ellis- 
ville went to various parts of the county and “inoculated” over 
2,000 hogs affected with cholera for the farmers of Jones County. 
Over 90 per cent of the hogs treated got well. Such a practical 
demonstration convinced the farmers that there is something worth 
while in the work of the agricultural high schools. They learned a 
lesson that meant dollars and cents to them. 
The conservation of human life marks the work of Miss Rowan, the 
home-science teacher at Poplarville, in Pearl River County. An 
invalid mother was induced by Miss Rowan to let the schoolgirls 
take care of her baby under Miss Rowan’s instructions. It is the 
school baby. It has had the best care that human hands, directed 
by skill and science, could give it. When asked why she had placed 
such a task upon herself and her young women of the school, Miss 
Rowan replied: 
Last year, immediately after school closed, several of my freshman girls married, 
and still a larger number of girls married in the other three school classes. I do not 
propose hereafter to let my girls take upon themselves the awful responsibilities of 
motherhood without knowing how to raise a baby.

SECONDARY EDUCATION.

Associate Professor of Education, Teachers College, Columbia’ University. 
ConrENTS.—General survey—Why improvement of high schools is slow—Pioneer efforts at improve: 
ment—The high school in the suryeys—The junior high school. 
So far as the number of secondary schools is concerned, the great 
majority are undoubtedly continuing traditional activities without 
serious consideration of the needs of the pupils or of the results 
actually obtained. The reactionary principals and teachers are of 
two classes—those who thoughtlessly follow traditions that were 
established many years ago for a more homogeneous group of children, 
and those who through thought are satisfied that the same rigid 
discipline is needed for all. The former class are always a dead- 
weight to any movement; the latter are serviceable, even when 
wrong, in that they prevent a too rapid modification of what expe- 
rience has found not wholly bad and in that they discourage the 
promulgation as ultimate cures of partial or erratic programs. 
It is peculiarly unfortunate that the small secondary schools, 
especially those in districts that must make real sacrifices for their 
support, should continue to be so ill-adapted to the obvious needs of 
their communities. It is difficult to see how the majority of them 
are justified, either by aim or by achievement. The larger secondary 
schools can afford to experiment, to offer to various homogeneous 
groups of pupils work differentiated according to their abilities and 
ambitions, and to add various extra-class activities which nearly 
simulate real life; but the smaller schools, on account of the limited 
number of pupils, of incomplete equipment, and of teachers who 
because of the salary are inexperienced or inefficient, offer what is 
usually a rather weak college preparatory course. It is no reflec- 
tion on the adequacy of this course for its peculiar purpose to say that 
when administered poorly and to all pupils alike, regardless of 
capacities, interests, or aims, it is extremely wasteful. The smaller 
secondary schools, which constitute one of the monuments to the 
American belief in education, beautiful even if often blind, need 
perhaps more than any other part of our educational system wise

reorganization. A satisfactory result is not likely to be gained 
merely by a change in the program of studies or in the curriculum; 
the teachers themselves must be improved. Whether this end be 
achieved by a system of rewards offered by the State, as proposed 
in Massachusetts, for continued and improved service in the same 
position; by centralized senior institutions to which many of the 
present struggling high schools will act as feeders, as recommended 
by the Vermont commission; by enlarging the high-school district 
and providing transportation for the pupils, as has been done in the 
Middle West; or by providing sufficient funds to support schools 
fitted to local needs, as in a number of small communities of the far 
West—whether this end be achieved by one of these means or by 
some other, local conditions must decide. We can not afford to con- 
tinue sacrificing the children so that the small secondary school may 
be little more than a stepping stone for the inexperienced or a haven 
for the incompetent teachers. 
WHY IMPROVEMENT OF HIGH SCHOOLS IS SLOW. 
Improvement in secondary schools is hampered for several reasons. 
In the first place, a majority of principals and teachers do not possess 
a philosophy of education which is satisfactorily based on the newer 
principles of psychology and sociology. A persistent belief on the 
part of many that because a subject or a part of a subject is difficult 
or distasteful, it is therefore educative, that habits acquired in one 
field are surely transferred to all others, and that native individual 
differences can be ignored or destroyed, makes progress all but 
impossible. Furthermore, much of the philosophy that has in it 
most promise for the future is stated in general terms which win 
verbal acceptance, but are not thereafter applied to the details of 
curriculum or teaching. The psychologist and the sociologist have 
already made contributions that will vitally affect secondary educa- 
tion, and to these they will doubtless add; it is the opportunity and 
the duty of schoolmen, when they comprehend and accept the new 
principles, fearlessly to apply them to the work of the schools. An 
attempt to do so will inevitably result in active opposition by those 
who are indurated in tradition regardless of its worth, and passive 
opposition by those who do not have the fundamental training and a 
vision; but if the principles are sound, the ultimate result can not be 
doubted. A notable effort to adjust the secondary schools of a State 
to its needs has been made by New Hampshire. 
Improvement is hindered, further, by the apparent lack of definite 
purposes in daily teaching. For a long time it was common belief— 
1.An outline of the plan was presented by Deputy Commissioner H. A. Brown in The School Review, 
March and April, 1914.
-P-A-G-E-167

perhaps it still is—that if a person knows the facts in his subject he 
can teach it. Undoubtedly subject matter is the first essential, 
but it is not the only one, in the making of a good teacher. To it 
certainly must be added specific, well-based purposes for every 
lesson. It is hopeful that the statements of purposes in educational 
literature are growing more and more definite. Perhaps the most 
promising immediate reform is likely to grow out of the work of 
the Commission of the National Education Association on the Reor- 
ganization of Secondary Education. A preliminary report was 
published as Bulletin No. 41, 1913, of the United States Bureau of 
Education, and the various subcommittees reported further at the 
Richmond meeting of the Department of Superintendence. The 
work of this commission has recently been fortified by the publica- 
tion of such composite books as ‘‘High School Education” and ‘‘The 
Principles of Secondary Education,” edited by Profs. Johnston and” 
Monroe, respectively, and several volumes in the Riverside Educa- 
tional Monographs.   
PIONEER EFFORTS AT IMPROVEMENT. 
Tt is not to be understood that all secondary schools are satisfied 
to perpetuate traditions. Perhaps the most important one impres- 
sion gathered from a visit last year to more than 150 high schools 
in 24 States, representing all sections of the country, is that of dis- 
satisfaction with present conditions, a dissatisfaction not merely 
with the administration of the details of schools as they exist, but 
also with the general organization and its achievements. This has 
resulted in the introduction side by side with the old studies of many 
new ones—from Roman customs and culture to tinsmithing—all of 
which may be counted as credit toward graduation, and in hopeful 
experimentation with the course of study in each individual subject, 
with the program of studies as a whole, and with various phases of 
the school organization. The small high school manifests such 
independent effort at reorganization only rarely, when a vigorous 
principal is for some reason held beyond the usual brief term. Usu- 
ally a change is caused by imitation of a neighboring city high school 
or through the influence of a new textbook. Among the larger 
high schools 90 per cent are probably earnestly trying to improve 
methods of instruction, while of these, perhaps one in four is, in 
the eyes of the conservative, dangerously revolutionary. 
Pioneer work in various subjects is being attempted in many 
parts of the country as never before, usually with the intention of 
relating subject matter more intimately and more consciously with 
actual life. Some notable attempts at improvement may be noted

as follows: In English are those undertaken by the National Council 
of Teachers of English and reported, for the most part, in the Eng- 
lish Journal. In Latin, the direct method, especially in the first 
year, is used in an increasing number of places—e. g., Jamaica High 
School, New York; the Horace Mann Schools, Columbia Univer- 
sity; and the Lincoln High School, of Portland, Oreg. The Wood- 
ward High School, Cincinnati, is developing a course in Latin that 
should be of peculiar value to students in the commercial depart- 
ment who will take only two years of an ancient language. In a 
number of schools there haye been exhibits stimulated by Frances 
E. Sabin’s ‘‘The Relation of Latin to Practical Life.’ Better still, 
the influence of these exhibits has obviously made itself felt in class- 
room instruction. In Oak Park, Ill., and the Hollywood High School, 
of Los Angeles, rooms have been supplied not only with pictures 
and busts of great Romans, but also with furniture in imitation of 
that used in Rome. The Hollywood and Grand Rapid Schools have 
given annually in Latin one or two short dramas. In the modern 
languages the teaching is more and more, apparently, by the direct 
or semidirect methods. The increase in the number of schools 
offering Spanish, especially as a preparation for foreign trade, is 
marked. Foreign languages, especially German, are begun in the 
lower grades in a number of cities—e, g., Cincinnati, Cleveland, and 
Columbus, Ohio; Gary and Richmond, Ind; and Buffalo, N. Y. 
The Rochester (N. Y.) East High School publishes monthly a German 
magazine, ‘‘Der Deutscher Kamerade,’”’ and several schools—those 
at Los Angeles, for example—give public performances of dramas 
in German or French. 
In music there are four lines of development that are achieving 
significant results. The first is the teaching of the history and appre- 
ciation of music. This work is presented in such places as Spring- 
field and Chelsea, Mass., Oak Park, Ill., Richmond, Ind., Kansas 
City, Mo., Pittsburgh, Pa., and Los Angeles, Cal., usually with the 
aid of phonographs and mechanical player pianos. The second, 
which supplements the first and reaches many more students, is the 
lecture on musical instruments, forms, and composition, followed by 
a performance by the local orchestra. This is found it larger cities 
like St. Louis and Minneapolis. The third is the organization of 
school orchestras and brass bands, participation in which usually 
carries school credit. Oakland, Cal., probably leads in this move- 
ment; it has recently expended $10,000 for band instruments. The 
fourth is the increasing tendency to allow credit for music taken 
outside school under approved teachers.?

SECONDARY EDUCATION. 131 
In fine arts there appears a gradual improvement of work in pro- 
portion to the increase in the number of teachers who are skillful 
both to execute and to instruct. The extension of the work in sec- 
ondary schools to include other than the usual media, to the making 
of jewelry, etc., and to all forms of applied design, is significant. 
Colorado Springs, Los Angeles, and Indianapolis represent cities doing 
unusual work of the former kind. The Washington Irving High 
School, of New York City, well represents the schools teaching applied 
art. At the Ethical Culture School, of New York City, there is 
developing a fine arts high school in which the entire course of the 
last two years, including literature, science, history, etc., is centered 
about art. 
In mathematics there is much advocacy of the European plan of 
introducing earlier algebra and geometry and of teaching them either 
together or on different days of the week. Pioneer work to this end 
has been done at the University of Chicago High School, at the Hor- 
ace Mann Schools and Stuyvesant High School, New York City, at 
the William Penn High School for Girls, Philadelphia, and at Lincoln, 
Nebr. At Indianapolis and Bloomington, Ind., Altoona, and South 
Pueblo, among other places, systematic effort has been made to teach 
pupils how to study mathematics, and at the last two places all the 
preparation for the first-year algebra recitations is said to be done 
in class. The tendency toward making mathematical problems prac- 
tical is marked, and in many places there are offered courses in house- 
hold arithmetic, commercial arithmetic, or shop mathematics. Such 
courses seem to satisfy the shop or laboratory better than the mathe- 
maticians, who assert that the work is not sufficiently extensive or 
logically organized. The: Tuskeegee plan of offering systematic 
courses in mathematics, but turning aside whenever it is possible to 
solve in class problems that arise in the shop or field work of the 
students, is an interesting compromise. 
It is in science that efforts at reorganization are most conspicuous. 
Beset by demands from the colleges that science be ‘logically organ- 
ized,” by demands from the newer subjects in the curriculum that it 
be adapted to their needs, and by the public that it be made more 
practical, high schools are offering new courses and are making 
prominent the practical type of problem even in those courses that 
retain their former organization. The new textbooks and the revi- 
sions of those already in use are indicative of the tendency. Some 
new courses offered are those in the chemistry of the household, of 
cooking, of industry, and of agriculture; those in the physics of farm 
life and of gas engines; and those in sanitation and health. There 
seems to be a minimum of opposition to the introduction of such 
courses; there is, however, a decided difference of opinion as to what 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
    182 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
preliminary courses there must be in pure science. The rapid prog- 
ress of ‘‘general science” for the first year of the four-year high- 
school course is marked, especially in the Middle West. Tho pioneer 
work in Chicago, New York, Oak Park, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, 
and Los Angeles is finding definite form in a number of textbooks 
which have recently appeared or are preparing. 
When closely examined, pioneer courses not infrequentiy are crude, 
time-consuming, and unsatisfactory. For example, household mathe- 
matics for certain girls meets with pretty general approval, but when 
such a course consumes a whole year of secondary education and 
does nothing more than apply the simpler principles of arithmetic to 
the business of housekeeping, it is not likely to be considered an 
equivalent for most of the courses already of established standing. 
The weakness of most of the pioneer courses is that they are com- 
promises; in attempting to rest on the newer philosophy of education 
and at the same time to meet traditional claims, they are unsatis- 
factory to both. Much of the protest of the high schools against 
the “dominance of the colleges”? has been due to the fact that the 
latter have not, as a rule, been kindly disposed toward innovations. 
Their position when opposing changes by competent teachers has 
been harmful to themselves as well as to the high schools; when 
opposing explorations from unstable bases toward uncertain ends, 
it is impregnable. If the underlying philosophy is sound and the 
effort fearlessly made toward worthy ends, the results must be ulti- 
mately approved. 
The introduction of novel courses and the reorganization of old 
ones emphasizes again the necessity of a consideration of educational 
values. Statistical studies showing that in certain secondary schools 
20 hours are given to subject A and only 4 to subject B, and that 
1 pupil-hour of subject A costs five times as much as 1 pupil-hour 
of subject B, are interesting, but no satisfying conclusions can be 
drawn from them until there is more knowledge concerning the 
value of each element involved. All over the country there seems 
to be a growing demand for the scientific measurement of educa- 
tional results, culminating in the bureaus of educational research 
established in a number of cities... One well-known private sec- 
ondary school had on its staff last year a consulting psychologist 
and statistician. The recent establishment of the Journal of 
Educational Administration and Supervision will provide another 
means of disseminating the results of experimental and statistical 
studies.

THE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE SURVEYS. 
The school surveys published during the year give a varying 
amount of attention to the high school. The Butte (Mont.) com- 
mission (George Drayton Strayer, director) presents a table show- 
ing the sizes of all high-school classes, which are relatively small, 
and suggests that for the sake of economy— 
      
  special attentioz rald be given to the technic of program making. It is noteworthy 
that the average size of the English sections, which for composition work all agree 
should be relatively small, is exceeded by the average size of sections in only geology 
and the commercial branches. 
The commission also presents a table showing the number and 
per cent of failures in each subject. This table manifests the usual 
wide range: In eight subjects there were no failures; in French and 
physics there was the maximum percentage (32+), while the aver- 
age in all classes was 10.77. The criticism of the high school, 
although limited in extent, is on the whole favorable. The com- 
mission mildly protests that the work is traditional and too limited 
inscope. It recommends an adequate new building, and after giving 
clearly its reasons, urges the establishment in the present high-school 
building of a junior high school. 
The report of the survey at Springfield, Ill., conducted by the 
Russell Sage Foundation (Leonard P. Ayres, director), contains 
a short chapter on the high school. The criticism is. directed 
against the organization, the building, the teaching, the course of 
study, and the failure to provide systematically for the advice of 
students in regard to their election of courses. Two sentences will 
illustrate one point of view of the surveyors: ‘‘Despite the fact that 
most of the children stay only one or two years and that this condi- 
tion has maintained ever since the high school has been in existence, 
the entire work of the school is planned as though all of the children 
who entered remained for the entire four-year course.” ‘The 
character of the work in the high school and the emphasis placed on 
the different subjects has been largely dictated by the demands of 
college entrance examinations. The fact is, however, that the 
Springfield high school is in only slight degree a college preparatory 
school.’ It is declared that only 1 pupil in 16 who enter the school 
goes to college. To relieve the overcrowded high-school building, 
to provide an easier transition to the high school, to hold pupils 
better, and to make less difficult the problems of vocational educa- 
tion, the commission recommends the establishment of four junior 
high schools. ' 
In the chapter on ‘‘The High-School Situation” of the report of 
the survey at South Bend, Ind. (J. F. Bobbitt, director), there are

four tables concerning the organization and cost of instruction.

The report criticizes severely the proportionate expenditure of time 
and money thus revealed. There is also presented another table in 
which the median salary of high-school teachers of South Bend is 
compared with the median in other cities of a similar size. 
The school survey of Portland, Oreg., under the direction of 
Ellwood P. Cubberley, contains criticisms and recommendations con- 
cerning secondary schools by John H. Francis and Frank E. Spaul- 
ding. The chief criticisms are that the high-school principals and 
teachers are engaged in teaching subjects rather than in educating 
the youth of the city; that the uniformity of curriculum for all high 
schools is a distinct barrier to progress; that subjects in the curricu- 
lum are uniform and isolated; that pupils’ courses lack unity and 
definiteness of purpose; and that the examination system costs 20 
per cent of the school year without returning results of significant 
value. Among the recommendations are that the city establish at 
convenient locations seven or eight junior high schools consisting of 
grades 7 to 9; that it extend the work upward two years both for 
those who will ultimately go to college and for those who will not; 
that it enlarge and modify the courses in the night high schools so as to 
supplement with theory the practical work done in trades during the 
day; that it provide in all the high schools more vocational and 
technical work; that it establish an art center in which high school 
pupils with especial aptitudes may devote each week one or two half 
days for which they will receive credit toward graduation; that it con- 
stantly modify the course of study to meet the ever-changing needs 
of pupils and to fit for the ever-varying service that society demands;
-P-A-G-E-173
  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 135 
that it keep the schools open from 8 o’clock to 5 six days in the week; 
and that it base promotions not on what a pupil has learned, but on 
what he needs to know. 
The report of the survey of education in Vermont, prepared by the 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, contains an 
extensive monograph on the secondary schools. William S. Learned, 
who prepared this section of the report, considers the high schools 
primarily in their relation to the State as a whole; everywhere he 
lays insistence on the importance of considering all the children of 
secondary school age. From among the 11 recommendations with 
which he concludes his study the following quotations will be of 
especial interest: 
6. A higher standard of qualification of teachers. No certificate should be granted 
merely for a college diploma; to be of value to the schools, college work must have 
been properly focused * * *, To this must be added in practice the stipulation 
that teachers be employed in those subjects in which they are prepared. _ [Experience 
in teaching under supervision should also be required.] 7. Improved conditions of 
service for teachers, e. g., reduction in the number of classes and subjects to be taught, 
increase of capable supervision, and gradual increase in salaries. 8. An avowed shift 
of emphasis in education from the curriculum to the child, involving the intimate and 
continuous study of each individual child to determine what his characteristics and 
needs are—his natural latent assets—and the adaptation of curriculum, organization, 
and methods of the school to the development of those assets, to the end that the 
value—personal, social, and economic—of each individual may be increased to the 
largest possible extent. 9. A persistent and careful scrutiny of the cost of the cur- 
riculum as applied to each school, with a view to securing the largest actual returns 
for the money involved * * *, It should lead to the abandonment of expensive 
courses for a few specialized students unless, as is often possible with pupils having 
initiative, these can be directed informally. 10. A general reorganization of the sec- 
ondary schools on the principle of centralization. [Fifteen to eighteen central high 
schools are proposed, with which numerous junior high schools presenting the work of 
Grades VII-X will articulate.] 11. Provision for the collection and interpretation of 
the most important secondary school statistics. 
  THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. 
Although among the variations in the organization of American 
schools there have doubtless many times been approximations to the 
junior high school, or intermediate school, the present movement 
toward an equal division of the 12 years of general education between 
the elementary and the secondary schools seems to have been initi- 
ated by E. W. Lyttle, who at the National Education Association 
in 1905 argued that “secondary education should begin as soon as 
the elementary pupil has acquired the tools with which he may gain 
a higher education.” Subsequent to this address the Department of 
Secondary Education appointed on the subject a standing committee 
of five, which, under Mr. Lyttle and G. P. Morrison as chairmen, 
reported to the association in 1907, 1908, and 1909. The first two 
reports presented arguments, both educational and economic, for 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  136 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the establishment of the six-year high school; the last one, after 
quoting from letters by prominent schoolmen who after more or less 
experience favored the organization, declared that “the change to 
a six-six division is inevitable; it is now taking place in various ways 
to meet local conditions.” The movement has had further impulse 
since then by the reports of the Committee on Economy of Time in 
Education and of the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary 
Education. 
However strong the arguments for annexing two years to the 
high-school period, such a change could hardly be successful unless 
at the same time there were dissatisfaction with the work now gener- 
ally done in the seventh and eighth grades. Such dissatisfaction 
there is in abundance. The distribution of eight years to the ele- 
mentary school and four to the high school is pretty generally accepted 
as an accident, finding no justification in comparative education, 
psychology, or the logical demands of local conditions. Besides this, 
the curriculum of the elementary school has become hopelessly con- 
gested, both by the introduction of subjects new to any curricula, 
and by the adoption, usually under stress, of subjects formerly 
taught in secondary schools. Most, if not all, of these subjects are 
now so firmly established that the attack on “school fads,” usually 
coupled with a demand for a “return to the three R’s,” is received 
with small sympathy by schoolmen or by the public. With an 
increasingly complex social and economic life, the schools can never 
return to the old simple form of education. Those defending the 
newer subjects declare that there would be ample time for all useful 
matter in the upper grades if there should be eliminated from such 
subjects as grammar and arithmetic the formal phases that can be 
justified only by tradition or by a belief in the discredited doctrine 
of formal discipline, and if they would put a stop to the wasteful and_ 
futile reviews that now occupy so much of the energy of these last 
years of the elementary school. It is charged, moreover, that there 
is a lack of real progress in the seventh and eighth grades, and that 
the large mortality of pupils in the first year of high school is due 
not to the arbitrary course or to the poor teaching in the upper school, 
but rather to the fact that the preparing school has not done its 
full duty. 
Another charge pretty generally made against the usual organiza- 
tion of our schools is that it causes too sharp a break after the eighth 
grade, that the elementary school courses lead nowhere, neither to 
the secondary school, nor to competent work in the world. Worse 
still, the break comes for a great many children about the time that 
the compulsory education law ceases to hold them in school and for 
the majority at the time when the changes concomitant with early 
adolescence are logically demanding satisfaction. At this time the 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 187 
demand for differentiated courses must be met or children leave 
school. The justification of the usual single course for all children 
has usually rested on a profession that democracy should afford an 
equal opportunity to all; but inasmuch as children of this age differ 
so markedly in ability, interests, and ambitions, democracy is fair 
only if it offers to each pupil what will best advance him in his pecu- 
liar development. The persistence of the traditional organization of 
the upper grades results in an annual loss of an impressive army of 
children, none of whom will contribute to society as well as if the 
school had adapted itself to his needs. The aggregate loss is tre- 
mendous. For all of these reasons, alleged and actual, the argu- 
ments for the new organization have been heard by schoolmen and 
by the lay public with unusual hospitality. 
THE NAME AND DEFINITION. 
Two names have been used for the new organization, the junior 
high school and the intermediate school, the latter being general in 
California, the former in most other parts of the country. There are 
obvious arguments for and against each; Supt. Cary, of Wisconsin, 
for example, prefers the name intermediate school, declaring that— 
one high school is enough in the minds of the people. This sort of school is ‘‘inter- 
mediate’’ between the grades and the high school and is not either grade work, as we 
now understand grade work, or high-school work, as we know high-school work. 
On the other hand, this name is likely to suggest grades 4 to 6 of 
the elementary school; while the name junior high school is more or 
less self-explanatory, it parallels the term junior college, and it is 
especially attractive to the children. Inasmuch as the organization, 
like the name, varies, a definition must be arbitrarily made. Al- 
though by some it is held that the junior high school, or the inter- 
mediate school should admit all children of 12 years, regardless of 
educational advancement, it is defined for the purposes of this report 
as an organization of grades 7 and 8 or 7 to 9 to provide by various 
means for individual differences, especially by an earlier introduction of 
prevocational work and of subjects usually taught in the high school. A 
definition on the basis of age is preferred by Commissioner Snedden, 
of Massachusetts, who predicts 100 junior high schools in that State 
within five years. 
APPROXIMATIONS IN THE UPPER GRADES TO THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, 
Tt will be seen at once that in the usual organization of the upper 
grades, especially in our better schools, there are frequently included 
some of the elements suggested by the definition above. Depart- 
mental teaching, for instance, which is customary in the junior high 
school, is frequently found in the upper grades. It is the practice to 
have special teachers of music, drawing, physical culture, and all
-P-A-G-E-176
    138 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
forms of industrial work; and, in addition to these, there is an in- 
creasing number of teachers who give instruction only in those aca- 
demic subjects in which they are strongest. The advantages of the 
plan are obvious; the chief objection seems to be that a child among 
several teachers may have no one who will be his especial adviser 
and friend.. This objection is anticipated by wise superintendents, 
who provide through a system of “home rooms’’ especial oversight 
to each pupil. It is infrequent, moreover, that in the upper grades 
there are as many teachers as subjects; in fact, one principle to be 
observed provides that the increase in the number of teachers for 
each child shall be gradual. 
The usual organization of the upper grades frequently includes some 
industrial work, too—sewing or cooking for the girls and some one of 
the various forms of manualwork for the boys. The difference seems 
to lie in this, that the elementary schoo! offers such work for the most 
part for general culture, whereas the junior high school offers it 
especially as prevocational training. Of course, there are exceptions 
to this statement; indeed, the tendency everywhere seems to be toward 
discarding exercises of a type that do not frequently reappear in life, 
and toward consciously presenting the subject so that a pupil finds 
out his own aptitude and interest in it. The upper grades some- 
times, but far less often, include also commercial branches, the ele- 
ments of algebra, and some foreign language, most frequently German. 
The question is often asked, why, if such differentiation is already 
begun in many elementary schools, there is any need for the new 
organization. From the fact that only a relatively few elementary 
schools have introduced even one of the subjects mentioned above 
and that nearly ail of the junior high schools offer a number of them 
it would seem that it is easier to introduce such subjects in a new 
organization than in the old. Moreover, there are other desirable 
elements of the junior high school that no reform of the upper grades 
can achieve; these elements are discussed later in this chapter. 
Many of the junior high schools, it must be said, are educational 
accidents. Occasionally the pupils of the first year in the high school 
have been segregated with those from the seventh and eighth grades 
in order to relieve congestion in the high-school building; in a larger 
number of cases, a new high-school building having been erected, the 
pupils of the upper grades, with or without those in the first year of 
the high school, are placed in the old building, which usually, besides 
being too good to be destroyed, is well adapted for such work. To this 
organization the school authorities have added various educational 
reforms with the result that a new type of school has been created. 
In many private schools and in a smaller number of small public high 
schools containing under one roof all the grades from the first to the 
tenth or twelfth, reorganization has been effected so that the essen-
-P-A-G-E-177

tials of the junior high school are incorporated into grades seven to 
nine. The success of these ventures, supported by educational theory, 
has stimulated other school systems to establish junior high schoois 
with new buildings suitably located, teachers fitted especially for the 
work, and a program of studies markedly different from that ordi- 
narily found. Los Angeles typifies this class. 
The very general approval of the plan to reorganize our educa- 
tional system so as to include junior high schools is significant of the 
trend of sentiment. Representative of sources of approval are the 
following: All but one of the school surveys published during the 
year, the one exception being in a city that had just erected a new 
$500,000 high-school building; the University of Minnesota, which by 
resolution passed by its faculty and its board of regents in 1914 ree- 
ommends the organization ‘‘as soon as local conditions will admit”; 
the Inland Empire Teachers Association, which indorsed the plan 
by a unanimous viva voce yote after an address by Commissioner 
Claxton; a committee appointed by the Association of City Superin- 
tendents of Wisconsin to study the plan; the National Council of 
Teachers of English, which is using the 6-3-3 division in the study 
of the teaching of English; the North Central Association; and numer- 
ous public addresses and articles in educational magazines. 
ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, 
There are four major claims made for the junior high school: 
First, that it provides better for individual differences; second, that 
it makes easier the transition to the high school; third, that it de- 
creases the number of pupils eliminated from the school system; 
and fourth, that it furnishes an opportunity for various reforms 
in instruction. The need for provision for individual differences, 
especially at the period of early adolescence, will be recognized by 
all who are cognizant of the studies made by psychologists during the 
past two decades. The possibility of securing homogeneity of 
groups is determined for the most part by the aggregate number 
of children assembled; consequently, when all of the children of the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in a system of schools are col- 
lected in one building, especially if departmental teaching and pro- 
motion by subject are provided, the grouping can be far more satis- 
factory for differentiated subject matter and instruction. The mere 
fact that all of the children in such an organization as the junior high 
school are so closely grouped in physiological, chronological, and 
mental ages is said also to make discipline much easier. In such a 
school it is possible in various ways to test each child and thereby 
to find what are his natural interests, his ambitions, and his capaci- 
ties. Moreover, he can be introduced to several subjects seldom 
taught in the grammar grades and learn himself if he have aptitudes 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
  140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
in them. If, after fair trial, it is found that a certain child has no 
ability in a subject of study or that it is not likely to forward him in 
the career which he has chosen, he can be directed to a course better 
for him. This exploration, if begun in the seventh or eighth year of 
school, reaches more children, and time lost here is not so material 
as it is when the children are two or three years nearer the end of 
the schooling afforded by the local community. 
By the definition arbitrarily made of the junior high school, it 
offers certain subjects usually found only in the high school, subjects 
like one or more foreign languages, mathematics beyond arithmetic, 
and prevocational studies, either commercial or industrial. It is felt 
by those who have most interest in the future of Latin that under 
the usual organization either too much or too little time is given to it, 
that in four y it is impossible to prepare youth for the college 
requirements in Latin and at the same time make the subject con- 
tribute the maximum of the cultural elements of which it is possible. 
The modern foreign languages are said to be acquired better if 
begun at 12 than at 14 or 15; whether they are or are not, it seems 
necessary for them to be introduced earlier, if they are to become 
working tools. The mathematician pleads that the character of 
mathematics should be changed after the sixth grade, first, because 
by that time the fundamental processes have been mastered; second, 
because of the lack of logic in the present sharp divisions after arith- 
metic and algebra; and, third, because of the greater success in all 
other civilized countries under the proposed redistribution of subject 
matter.!| The introductory work in prevocational subjects is justified 
by the fact that each child taking it gets something of practical 
value, that it reaches a far larger number than when introduced in the 
ninth year, that it gives each child a more intelligent understanding 
of the work of the world, and that it acquaints him with the possi- 
bilities in the subjects and in himself. For several of these reasons 
it would seem that the logical place for general science also is in the 
first two years of the junior high school. 
Finally, so far as individual differences are concerned, the larger 
number of pupils collected into one organization makes possible bet- 
ter provisions for children with varying degrees of ability and indus- 
try. Wherever there have been organized ‘‘flying squadrons” of 
exceptional children, they have been collected from a large area into 
one building. There is no reason why the children with superior 
intellectual endowments should not be permitted and encouraged to 
save a considerable part of the secondary school period and at the 
same time to do the work better than their less fortunate brothers. 
Neither skipping a grade nor carrying an extra subject is satisfac-

Bureau of Education.
-P-A-G-E-179
  
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 141 
tory; but accelerant groups have proved economical in every respect. 
There are in all systems, too, children who learn slowly. If placed in 
classes formed regardless of the ability of the pupils, they inevitably 
retard the progress of the work, learn little themselves, and often fail 
of promotion. For such children repeating the work is far from satis- 
factory; an unpublished study recently made at Teachers College by 
John BR. Riley of some eight thousand cases shows that after repeat- 
ing and passing a course in which they had failed, 33 per cent of the 
children who continued the subject failed again the next semester. 
It may be assumed that at least a majority of those who were 
“passed” after taking the course a second time would have failed 
had they pursued the subject further. It is in no way fair to doom 
perhaps a fifth of our pupils to the loss of spirit and ambition by 
sending them to inevitable failure. It is often argued that slow- 
moving children need the stimulus of better workers in the same 
classes. This may be true if they move slowly through laziness; it is 
contrary to life in all of its other phases if it is due to lack of ability. 
Of the many provisions that have been made for children with vary- 
ing ability to progress none seems better than that at the Manual 
Training High School of Indianapolis. There in certain subjects at 
least one group is formed of children whose record shows that they 
are able to do the work of three semesters in two, and at least one 
group who will need three semesters for the work that the majority 
of pupils do in two-thirds of that time. 
The second claim, that the new organization makes easier the 
transition of pupils to the high school, has abundant theoretical sup- 
port. The actual results depend, of course, on the completeness with 
which the details are adapted and administered. That the change 
between the elementary and the high school should be so sharp as it 
usually is permits of no general justification. The small understand- 
ing of what the subjects are that the high school presents; the antici- 
pation of exchanging one teacher with whom there is a thorough 
understanding for several strangers; the prospect of leaving a near-by 
building in which he has had one room that he could call his home, 
and in which he has been a senior more or less lording it over children 
from one to seven years younger than himself; of leaving this com- 
fortable building for another perhaps in a remote part of the city 
and there shifting hourly from strange room to stranger laboratory; 
the contemplation of the new atmosphere, the new ideals, and the new 
methods used—all these may stimulate the desire of some children 
to enter the high school; by pretty general testimony they terrorize 
many more. This larger group of children have “finished” reading, 
language, arithmetic, and other subjects traditional in the elementary 
school, and far too often they have no desire to enter another long 
campaign, the results of which have by common rumor been disas-
-P-A-G-E-180
142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
trous to so many friends who have tried it before. In all reports of 
attempts to ‘“‘bridge the gap”’ by an earlier introduction of high- 
school subjects, the methods of teaching, or the larger responsibility 
of the secondary school, whether the introduction be into the junior 
high school or into the upper grades of the old organization, greatly 
improved results are claimed. It is difficult to measure such results; 
but it is reasonable that they should follow, and observation of a 
considerable number of schools that have made such changes as are 
noted above leaves a strong impression that they are generally 
achieved. 
The third claim, that the junior high-school organization decreases 
elimination, is based in theory largely on the sharp break discussed 
in the preceding paragraph. There is no question that the elimina- 
tion after the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades has been jone of the 
greatest of the reproaches to our educational system. Consequently 
any plan that promises to retain children in school beyond these 
grades is worthy of the most careful consideration. Not only is the 
present break after the elementary school too sharp; it also coincides 
in perhaps the majority of cases with the onset of adolescence and 
the end of the period of education compulsory by law. It is claimed 
that the junior high school, which receives the pupil usually before 
the law permits him to leave school, should for two reasons hold him 
better to the end of the course and then increase the chances of his 
going on with his education. In the first place, it affords no con- 
venient stopping point; and, in the second, it is organized and 
administered for the individual adolescent. Of the number of 
principals of junior high schools reporting, 107 declare that the 
organization does retain pupils in school better than the older plan, 
and 2 say that it does not. To the 3 who say frankly that they do 
not know what the effect on elimination is should probably be 
added all those who fail to answer the question. There are few pub- 
lished comparisons of the exact saving effected by the new organi- 
zation. Supt. Francis in 1912 declared that in Los Angeles only 18 per 
cent of the pupils in the ninth grade of the junior high school failed, 
as compared with 42 per cent of those in the ninth grade of the high 
schools. 
From a report! made to Supt. Francis by the principals of the 
intermediate schools for the year 1913-14 the following tables are 
taken:

Principal W. B. Clark, of the McKinley Intermediate School, Berke- 
ley, furnishes data showing that since the establishment of the school 
94.73 per cent of the pupils completing the eighth grade have entered 
the ninth, and 95.29 per cent of those completing the ninth grade 
have entered the tenth. Principal Preston, of the Franklin Inter- 
mediate School, Berkeley, reports that of the last seven classes com- 
pleting the eighth grade under the old organization 40.53 per cent 
entered the high school, and that of the first six classes completing 
the eighth grade of the intermediate school there entered the ninth 
grade of the same school 65.53 per cent, not counting those who  
-P-A-G-E-182
    144 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
were transferred from other buildings: Principal Paul C. Stetson 
states that 86 per cent of the pupils in the eighth grade in the Grand 
Rapids junior high school last year entered the senior high school, 
as compared with 76 per cent of the eighth grades in the grammar 
schools of the city. In Evansville, Ind., according to Principal 
Ernest P. Wiles, only 56 per cent of the pupils completing the eighth 
grade in 1912 entered the high school, as against 84 per cent last year: 
of the pupils in the junior high school. 
The last of the four major claims for the junior high school is that 
it furnishes an opportunity for various reforms in instruction. This 
implies what has not been obvious in all discussions of the subject, 
that the junior high school is not a sure cure for all the ills in our 
educational system, but that it affords an opportunity for introduc- 
ing reforms which might in a traditional situation be more difficult. 
It should be frankly admitted that the division of the 12 years of 
common schooling into two equal parts is not the one essential to 
educational advance; but in a new organization a course of study 
based on the newer principles of psychology, sociology, and economics, 
various provisions for individual differences, and especially an im- 
proved method of teaching can more easily be introduced. The 
governing principles of this improved method have been set forth 
in a number of the newer books—in none better perhaps than in 
John Dewey’s ‘‘How We Think” and in his ‘‘Interest and Effort in 
Education.’ These principles are concretely applied in the ‘‘pro- 
ject method,” which is being developed in the teaching of a number 
of subjects of secondary education. Marshall, Wright, and Field, 
for instance, have written ‘‘Outlines of Economics Developed in a 
Series of Problems”; the State of Massachusetts has issued bulle- 
tins such as ‘Agricultural Project Study,’ ‘Agricultural Project 
Study Bibliography,’ and ‘‘Project Study Outlines for Vegetable 
Growing;” and projects are introduced as exercises in several of the 
newer textbooks.? With a definite program for reform, a principal 
is likely to find marked help in a junior high school; without such a 
program, he would just as well, if not better, retain such an organiza- 
tion as he has. 
OBSTACLES TO THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. 
Among the obstacles to the organization of junior high schools are 
several that in time will be removed as inevitably as they arise, and 
several others that will remain, to be more or less offset by advan- 
tages. In the first group is the fact that a number of the States so 
define elementary and secondary education that there is no legal 
sanction for a third type composed of grades taken from each of the   
1These last data are taken from the manuscript of a report in preparation on the intermediate schools 
of California by Commissioner Will C. Wood.

-P-A-G-E-183
  
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 145 
others. This is the case in California; but there the obstacle is over- 
come by paying each teacher in the intermediate schools from funds 
designed for the grade or grades in which he does his work. Because 
of the growth and success of these schools in California, the legislature 
is likely to follow the recommendation of the commissioners of second- 
ary and of vocational education and provide legally for the organiza- 
tion of separate schools consisting of grades 7 to 9 or 7 to 12. Inas- 
much as the legal obstacle now existing in various States arose from 
the demands of another situation, there is likely to be small difficulty 
in securing, where it is necessary, legislation permitting junior high 
schools. Objections to the junior-high-school plan have in a number 
of cases come from principals of elementary schools that lose the two 
upper grades and from teachers of those grades who are not qualified 
for the junior high school and who ‘‘would regard the dignity of their 
position as lowered if put into lower grades.” These objections have, 
of course, been silenced as the new organization has been completed; if 
they are not powerful enough to prevent the creation of a junior high 
school, they are likely to harm it less and less as the months pass. 
Another objection which is likely to be temporary, but which until it 
passes should be overcome by some compromise, is the fact that the 
organization of one or more junior high schools is likely to cause a 
longer walk for some of the children in both the upper and the lower 
grades. Forsome children in the upper grades the longer daily jour- 
ney is likely to be more than offset by the shorter journey for a 
larger number; and for the youngest children Supt. Francis suggests 
that a primary school of the first, second, and possibly third grades 
be retained in or near the building to be devoted to the junior high 
school. Even in Los Angeles, where the new organization is most 
flourishing, there are still compromises, in the secondary as well as in 
the elementary schools. 
One obstacle to the junior high school, as to almost any other 
educational improvement, is the likelihood that it will increase 
the budget. It is difficult to secure accurate information as to the 
cost of items of expenditure for schools; of 167 who, in answer to the 
questionnaire say that they have one or more junior high schools, only 
30 report the items regarding cost; and 17 of these say that the junior 
high school costs more per capita (the amount spent for maintenance 
and operation divided by the average number of pupils attending) 
than the first six grades; 7 say that the cost is the same; and 6 qualify 
their answers. Comparing the cost with that of the high school, 10 
say that it is the same, and 20 thatitisless. Supt. Francis estimates 
that the per capita cost of the junior high school will be intermediate 
between that of the elementary school and that of the high school. 
The increased cost over the elementary school, though a real, is not a 
73226° —xp 1914—vor 1——10  
-P-A-G-E-184
  146 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
logical objection, for, as Supt. Holland, of Louisville, Ky., has pointed 
out in his annual report, the distribution of funds between the 
elementary and the secondary schools is seldom determined by 
fundamental reasons. If, as is general, secondary education is 
likely to cost two or three times as much as elementary, it is only 
reasonable that the increase be gradual, instead of coming with 
great suddenness at the end of the eighth grade. A reason for 
increased cost that shows a real economy is suggested by the claim, 
which is, in all but a few cases, sound; that the junior high schools 
retain many children from one to four years longer in the school 
system. If, as is also claimed, probably with excellent reason, the 
number of ‘‘repeaters”’ is decreased, there is a credit partly to offset 
the increased debit. 
Junior high schools are likely to be handicapped for the present 
by the lack of specially prepared teachers and by the inappropriate- 
ness of most of the existing textbooks. As the demands increase, 
however, they will unquestionably be satisfied. Thus far the teach- 
ers for the new unit have been selected from both the elementary 
and the high schools; under the California law this was imperative, 
and in other States it seemed wise to use the superior skill of the best 
grammar-grade teachers in those subjects of which they had a 
mastery and to introduce teachers from the regular high school for 
such other subjects as Latin and composite mathematics. But now 
teachers are in several ways being especially prepared for the junior 
high school. At least one of the largest colleges of education is 
offering courses leading to this end, and several cities independently 
are developing their own teachers. Rochester, N. Y., for instance, 
in anticipation of four junior high schools, has offered weekly work in 
the several subjects that will be introduced; from those successfully 
taking the courses, a number of the teachers for the new schools will 
be selected. From the 1,528 teachers reported in an incompleted 
tabulation as giving instruction in junior high schools (1,189 full 
time, 439 part time), 581 had previous experience in both elementary 
and secondary schools, 209 in secondary schools alone, and 642 in 
elementary schools alone. This means that only about 6 per cent of 
the teachers now in junior high schools were without experience when 
they were selected; nearly two-thirds of this small number came 
directly from college, the remainder from normal schools. Although 
data concerning the sex of the teachers were not requested, it is 
obvious from the reports that in the first two years of the junior high 
school there is a considerably larger proportion of men than is found 
in the seventh and eighth grades of the grammar school. 
A more fundamental objection has been raised by Director W. C. 
Bagley (School and Home Education, Oct., 1914). Admitting that 
“the advantages are clearly on the side of a six-six organization 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 147 
from the point of view of administrative expediency and to a large 
extent from the standpoint of educational theory,” he doubts the 
wisdom of early differentiation, in that children may fail to get 
“common basis of certain ideas and ideals and standards which go 
a long way toward insuring social solidarity—a basis of common 
thought and common aspiration which is absolutely essential to an 
effective democracy.” “Stratified society,’ he thinks, may “ encour- 
age the development of social groups that can not understand one 
another because they lack a common basis of knowledge, ideal, and 
aspiration.” This objection will have weight in proportion to the 
belief that the present educational organization results in social 
solidarity. Representing the other point of view is Prof. E. V. D. 
Robinson’s statement (School Review, XX, 677) that “we can not 
forever go on sacrificing educational efficiency to a fetish of equality 
represented by a uniform course of study.” 
EXISTING JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In reply to a questionnaire sent to superintendents of schools in 
every city in the United States of 2,500 population or over, there were 
received 977 replies. Of these, 843 have no junior high schools, 159 
gave no reasons for having none; of the remaining 684, 232 have 
none because of a preference for the usual organization, 184 because 
of the probable increase in cost, 10 because the school system is too 
small, 58 because the buildings are unsuited or their teachers are not 
adequately prepared, and 232 because of ‘other administrative 
reasons.’ A number of the superintendents, as will be noted, gave 
two or three reasons. 
One hundred and sixty-seven cities from which replies were received 
are said to have one or more junior high schools according to the 
definition used in the questionnaire, ‘A junior high school is here 
defined as a special organization of grades 7 and 8 or of 7,8, and 9, to 
provide for greater differentiation of studies, better care of individual 
pupils, an easier transition to high school, longer school life, etc.” 
To this number must be added 20 other cities listed in the report of 
the Commissioner of Education for 1912 (Vol. I, p. 155), and 6 
others listed in the 1914 report of Commissioner Wood, of California, 
from none of which returns were received. This would make a total 
of 193 cities having junior high schools in 1913-14. By the definition” 
used earlier in this report— 
A junior high school is defined as an organization of grades 7 and 8 or 7 to 9, whether 
housed with the senior high school or independently, to provide by various means for 
individual differences, especially by an earlier introduction of prevocational work 
or of subjects usually taught in the high school, 
and, excluding the element of vocational work because of indefinite- 
ness of data, the 167 cities are reduced to 57. How many of the 26 
in the other two compilations would fall under the second definition

is not accurately known; however, they are included in the following 
list. This can not pretend to completeness or even to absolute 
accuracy ; dependence had to be placed on the data, often incomplete, 
that were furnished in the replies to the questionnaire. Further study 
of the returns will doubtless cause modifications of the list.

Because of the fact that they do not satisfy the details of the 
definition arbitrarily made, 114 cities that reported junior high 
schools are not included in the above list. They would all have been 
presented in a separate list with the facts concerning each had these 
been fully recorded in the questionnaire, but from the varying amounts 
of data returned it is obvious that all depart somewhat—a few of 
them greatly—from our conception of what a junior high school is. 
The following table shows the organization in which each of the 114 
intermediate schools is included. In reading it, one must keep in 
mind that in a number of States there are usually only seven grades 
preceding the high school and that in a few cities there are nine. 
Junior high school claimed, but not allowed by definition.

  150 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
In a number of cases schools were reported which, although not 
designated as junior high schools or intermediate schools, yet have 
the characteristics stated in our definition. Of these, only Spring- 
field, Mass., which has at least three schools that by any definition 
are clearly junior high schools, has been included in the list. Of the 
following 83 cities which report that they offer algebra or foreign 
languages in one or two of the grades preceding the high school, 64 
offer algebra, 21 Latin, 18 German, 3 French, and 2 Spanish. Some 
of them have segregated the upper grades; most of them have not. 
A much longer list could be added of cities that have departmental 
teaching, with or without segregation, in the upper grades. In all 
of these cities only a few changes would be needed in organization 
or in curriculum to secure a number of the additional advantages 
claimed for the junior high school.

Tn addition to the number of cities that are said to have junior 
high schools, judged by either definition, 136 report that they intend 
to effect the new organization before the school year 1916-17, and 62 
others before 1919-20. Besides these 198 cities of more than 2,500 
population, 24 report that they “hope to” or ‘“‘may possibly” estab-

lish junior high schools during the next few years. Even though a 
considerable percentage of these hopes may fail of fruition, the total 
of 222 cities seriously considering the plan is indicative of the extent 
of interest in the movement. 
CURRICULA OF JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 
To illustrate the wide range of studies offered by various junior 
high schools, the following representative curricula and a plan for 
organization are appended. This plan was made and partly applied 
by I. E. Goldwasser, formerly principal of one of the three interme- 
diate schools in New York City. The curricula are from Los Angeles, 
which has by far outstripped all other cities in developing junior 
high schools; from the recommendation of the school survey of Butte; 
an the Wisconsin High School, which is controlled by the depart- 
ment of education of the University of Wisconsin; and from the 
Horace Mann School for Girls, Teachers College, Columbia University, 
a school that sends annually about 60 per cent of its graduates direct 
to college. 
I. Orcanization SucGEstTep ror THE New Yorx Crry Tyrr.! 
The following plan of organization is suggested: 
1. Secure from the principals of 6B schools a detailed statement of the special apti- 
tudes and weaknesses of pupils entering the intermediate school. Classify new 
admissions on the basis of these reports so as to secure a certain degree of homogeneity 
in the composition of each class. 
2. Institute tests of a general nature in the 7A grade, to determine general intelli- 
gence, manual skill, power of judgment in practical situations, etc. Tabulate all 
such findings for future reference. * * * 
3. Beginning with 7A grade and extending through the 8A grade, course should be 
established in electric-wiring, sheet-metal work, wood-turning, leather work, etc., 
for boys, and in dressmaking, millinery, embroidering, machine work, etc., for girls. 
Each course should extend over a period of nine weeks, thus affording a series of six 
courses. All pupils should be required to take each course in turn. Time schedules 
should be so arranged that at least eight hours a week may be devoted to the special 
courses. No attempt should be made to do more than acquaint the pupil with the 
fundamental simple processes underlying the various occupations. 
4. Every pupil should be carefully observed while at work and a detailed record 
kept of his or her proficiency in the course. The work should be so planned as to 
make data available with regard to general adaptability, rather than to give skill in 
the occupation as such. 
5. During the 8A grades, conferences should be held between parent, pupil, and 
teacher; the results of the tests and the records of the course should be carefully 
examined; and the pupil should be directed into the course for which he appears to 
be suited and in which all conditions combine to make it probable that he will become 
efficient. 
It is in the 8B grades that the special training should begin. Small groups should 
be formed for each course. Intricate processes can not be taught, nor can work of a

heavy nature be undertaken. One of the objects sought in the studies of the voca- 
tion bureau of Boston is stated thus: “‘To analyze the relation of aptitudes, interests, 
and habits to modern industrial demands, and thus lay an adequate foundation for 
a system of training regardiul of social as well as economic needs.’” Whatever train- 
ing is given should be along lines determined by some such study as this. The 
courses should be checked up constantly by the results of occupational investigations 
and must be organized with an ever-present ideal of sympathetic vocational guidance. 
Pupils who wish to enter a classical high school with the idea of graduating should 
be enrolled at the beginning of the 8B grade in classes organized for such pupils. 
Special attention should be given to technical grammer, to the fundamental prin- 
ciples underlying arithmetical operations, to oral English with particular reference 
to the technique of correct speech, to penmanship, to the mechanics of written lan- 
guage, spelling, punctuation, etc., and to teaching pupils how to study. 
Pupils who intend to complete the full course in a commercial high school should 
be enrolled at the beginning of the 8B grade in classes organized for such pupils. 
Special attention should be given to correct oral English as regards both the tech- 
nique of speech and freedom from foreign idioms; to letter writing; to study of busi- 
ness forms; to an explanation of the principles underlying the various kinds of 
business to which arithmetic applications are made, such as commission, discount, 
insurance, etc.; to commercial geography, and to modes of manufacture. 
Pupils who intend to complete the full course in a manual training trade high 
school should be enrolled at the beginning of the 8A grade in classes organized for 
_ such pupils. Special attention should be given to correct oral English as regards 
both the technique of speech and freedom from foreign idioms; to mechanical and 
free-hand drawing; to the fundamental arithmetical operations; to simple construc- 
tional geometry; to elementary algebra; to science; to modes of manufacture in the 
various industries; to shopwork. 
Girls who intend to complete the full course in a technical high school should be 
enrolled at the beginning of the 8B grade in classes organized for such pupils. Special 
attention should be given to sewing (hand and machine), embroidering, with appli- 
cations to dressmaking and millinery; to cooking and a study of food values; to 
home making in general. For the last-named work use should be made of the model 
flat built for this specific purpose. 
This will leave a large number of pupils who, under ordinary cee would 
leave the school at the end of the eighth year, or when they had attended a half year 
or more at a high school. During the year and a half from the beginning of the 7B 
grade the aptitudes of these pupils have been tested at the different occupational 
activities carried on; their general intelligence and their special powers have been 
carefully noted. A study should also have been made of their home conditions, the 
needs of the family, etc. The principal or competent teachers should have held 
interviews with the parents with a view of arriving at some knowledge of the pupil’s 
aims and those of his family. The ‘“‘vocational guide” should proceed to suggest 
what line of work the pupil should take up. 
Tf there is still uncertainty as to what the ultimate choice is to be, the academic 
course should be recommended. For those intending to enter business the com- 
mercial course should be urged, while the industrial course should be recommended 
to those who wish to enter one of the trades.

To graduate from the high school, a pupil must complete the required studies of 
the junior high school and take enough electives during the senior high school to make 
twenty points per year. One of these points each year must be in physical training. 
Pupils of the high school who are making a serious study of vocal or instrumental 
music outside of school, under private tuition, will receive, under certain conditions, 
credit toward graduation. 
Also members of the school orchestra and the school glee club, who regularly attend 
the rehearsals and public performances of these organizations, will receive a credit of 
one point,

and elections. 
GENERAL TENDENCIES. 
The dominant tendency in higher education during the year 
under review is toward concentration. It appears in the develop- 
ments affecting the external relations of colleges and universities 
to State authority. It is even more clearly evident in the changes 
relating to internal administration. The day of the academic 
promoter, of the inflation of values, is over. Expansion is still going 
on, but for the most part unaccompanied by the frenzied advertising 
so common in the past and encouragingly free from the optimistic 
confusion of prospects with realities. Indeed the developments 
within the year strengthen the conviction which has been ripening 
for some time that college and university education has outgrown 
the boom stage. It is now looking to its foundations and setting 
its house in order. 
The extent to which colleges and universities have come under 
the sway of the trite but still potent slogan, ‘‘efficiency,” is shown 
by a brief summary of the noteworthy happenings in the field of 
higher education in 1913-14. In three more States—Montana, Kan- 
sas, and Idaho—the administration of State institutions of higher 
education has been further centralized through recent legislative 
action, in Kansas and Idaho by the adoption of a single board of 
control. The movement in the direction of authoritative classification 
159 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
of universities and colleges has gained added momentum. Uni- 
versity and college surveys undertaken both by outsiders and by 
officials of the institutions to be examined have become increasingly 
frequent. There has been vigorous activity on the part of several 
voluntary associations that concern themselves with standards of 
entrance, graduation, and institutional equipment, some of which 
has crystallized in the form of recommendations that will affect 
educational procedure over considerable areas. 
The problems dealt with by these associations have also been 
the subject of legislation by the faculties of a large number of indi- 
vidual institutions. Entrance requirements are still being modified. 
They have become more uniform in extent and more varied in con- 
tent. The adoption of some form of the group system has been 
reported to the Bureau of Education by 21 institutions, undoubtedly 
only a fraction of the whole number of colleges that have taken 
this step. 
In this connection it might be noted that, although no generally 
accepted philosophy of college education has yet emerged, the 
thinkers on the subject now appear to be divided into two camps. 
The first contains those who believe in the policy of which Harvard 
College has lately been the protagonist, namely, wide freedom in the 
choice of the major subject, prescription of a certain number of 
hours in each of the main fields of knowledge, and the absolute 
requirement only of English and modern languages. The other 
group represents a dogmatic opinion, to the effect that there must 
be a single curriculum best adapted to fit young men for efficient 
citizenship and community leadership. This view has long been 
embodied in the curricula of the higher educational institutions of 
the Catholic Church. Many Protestants are now beginning to 
advocate a like educational policy. A curriculum which will pre- 
sent the essentials of the humanities and the natural sciences, together 
with history, economics, and sociology, and will furnish the inter- 
pretation of all these subjects through the aid of philosophy has been 
suggested. The appearance of a somewhat similar program in the 
professional field of engineering education (see p. 188) presents evi- 
dence of the extent to which this conception has influenced educa- 
tional thought. 
In addition to these more fundamental matters, several institu- 
tions are experimenting with new types of vocational courses related 
to local industrial activities. The extension movement has spread 
rapidly. The idea, apparently destined to much greater promi- 
nence in future educational discussions, that it is the quality rather 
than the quantity of work done by a college student that counts 
toward effective education, has already received tangible recognition 
in‘a few institutions through the granting of extra credit for quality.
-P-A-G-E-199
  
HIGHER EDUCATION, 161 
Several prominent institutions have been reorganized; at others 
new departments have been formed. All of these movements have 
been. accompanied by the inevitable changes in the incumbency of 
the directive offices through death, resignation, and calls to other 
fields of service. 
In the following discussion certain of the more prominent topics 
of this summary receive somewhat extended treatment. 
NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN STATE CONTROL OF HIGHER EDUCATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS. 
MONTANA. 
Previous reports have called attention to the overlapping and 
duplication among the higher educational institutions of Montana 
and have recorded the efforts. of a former president of the State 
university to bring about a rational consolidation which would save 
the State both a considerable waste of money and the friction of 
institutional rivalry. A tentative step in this direction was taken, 
not without opposition, by the legislature of 1913, which passed an 
act organizing the State university at Missoula, the College of Agri- 
culture and Mechanic Arts at Bozeman, the School of Mines at 
Butte, and the State Normal School at Dillon into the University 
of Montana. The control and supervision of the university is placed 
in the hands of the State board of education.t The board is em- 
powered to appoint a chancellor of the university and to make 
whatever rules may be necessary to prevent unnecessary duplica- 
tions of courses of instruction in the various component parts of the 
university. In July, 1913, the board voted to discontinue the 
courses in engineering at the State university at Missoula and to 
concentrate all of the engineering courses at the State College of 
Agriculture and Mechanic Arts at Bozeman, with the exception of 
the work in mining engineering, which is still carried on by the 
School of Mines at Butte. The dean and several members of the 
engineering faculty at Missoula were transferred to the institution 
at Bozeman. 
KANSAS. 
Allusion has also been made in previous reports to the efforts of 
Kansas to unite its higher institutions under one board. In 1913 
the legislature finally passed an act bringing this about. The act 
creates a State board of administration charged with the government 
of the University of Kansas, the Kansas State normal schools, the 
Kansas State Agricultural College, the school for the deaf, and the 
school for the blind. The board consists of three members, not more 
than two of whom may belong to the same political party and not   
1 Control of State institutions of higher education in Montana has been vested in the State board of 
education since 1893. 
73226°—xp 1914—vo1t 1——11
-P-A-G-E-200
  162 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
more than one of whom may be an alumnus of any one of the educa- 
tional institutions over which the board has control, nor more than 
one from any single congressional district. This board is appointed 
by the governor with the consent of the senate. Its members hold 
office for four years, their terms expiring at different dates. Each 
receives an annual salary of $3,500, together with an allowance for 
all traveling expenses incurred in the discharge of official functions, 
and is expected to devote his whole time to the duties of the board. 
The board elects a secretary, not one of its members, who, however, 
must be an experienced educator. It also may employ the clerical 
force necessary to conduct its business. 
The authority of the board is extensive. It has the power to elect 
the presidents and treasurers of the institutions named in the act; 
to appoint professors, instructors, and all other employees, to fix the 
compensation of these officers and to determine their promotion, to 
make rules for the administration and government of the institutions, 
as well as to control their property. 
It will be seen that no other State has vested such wide powers in 
so small a body of directors. While the board combines the func- 
tions of a board of control and an executive committee in a manner 
not quite in accord with the results of experience in other fields of 
public administration, nevertheless the efficacy of this type of man- 
agement depends upon the quality of the board itself. The personnel 
of the Kansas board and the restraint which it has shown in the 
first 11 months of its existence augur well for the success of the 
Kansas experiment. 
IDAHO. 
Equally important and unusual is the act recently passed by the 
Legislature of the State of Idaho. This creates a State board of 
education which constitutes also the board of regents of the Univer- 
sity of Idaho. The supervision and government not only of the 
university, the two State normal schools, and special schools of the 
State, but also of the whole elementary and secondary system, is placed 
in the hands of this board. The board consists of five members ap- 
pointed by the governor, without reference to locality, party affilia-. 
tion, or religion, one annually, for a term of five years. No member of 
the board can have been connected with any of the State educa- 
tional institutions. The necessary personal and traveling expenses 
of the board are paid, and in addition each member receives an hon- 
orarium of $100. The board’s functions, by the terms of the act, are 
purely legislative and advisory. As its executive officer it appoints, 
at such salary as it may designate, a commissioner of education, who 
is to be the supreme executive official of the educational depart- 
ment of the State. It also appoints such other specialists, assistants, 
clerks, or other executive officers as are deemed necessary, upon the 
recommendation of the commissioner. The act distinctly specifies
-P-A-G-E-201
HIGHER EDUCATION, 163 
that the execution of the instructions of the board is to be left en- 
tirely to the experts that the board employs; the board’s authority 
merely includes the determination of policies and the prescription of 
methods of procedure. 
This separation of the legislative from the executive functions 
and the consequent freeing of the executive officer from petty and 
destructive interference is in accord with the best modern practice 
in administration. It has been tested and found admirably effica- 
cious in the management of large corporations, municipal govern- 
ments, and city school systems. 
Through its executive officers the board is to have full charge of 
the public-school system of the State, the coordination of the different, 
grades of education, the certification of teachers, the control of 
buildings, etc. 
Unquestionably the most interesting feature of the act is the crea- 
tion of the new office of commissioner of education, which is invested 
with large dignity and power and with opportunities for the exercise 
of educational statesmanship. The election of Dr. HE. O. Sisson as 
commissioner gives promise of wise and constructive leadership. 
Idaho’s experiment will be watched with great interest. 
THE NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE ENTRANCE CERTIFICATE BOARD AND 
THE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION, 
A recent protest of the New England State education officers 
against the methods and influence of the New England College 
Entrance Certificate Board gives public emphasis to certain very 
significant educational developments in that section. New England 
has been preeminently the stronghold of the principle of private as 
opposed to State control of higher education. Maine is the only 
State of the group having a State university of the same type as 
the State universities of the West and South. The colleges of 
New England, being neither tax supported nor managed by public 
officers, have determined the content and set the aims of higher 
education according to their own best judgment, without reference 
to the desires of the lower schools. They have, indeed, been in a 
position to force the secondary schools to give such courses and 
establish such standards as the colleges themselves have prescribed. 
The complaints of ‘‘college domination of the high school,’? which 
have occupied so prominent a place in educational discussions have 
perhaps most frequently referred to the colleges of New England. 
Yet it is only justice to record that this ‘‘domination”’ has been one 
ef the chief influences in improving the public high school. 
The power of the colleges in this direction is due primarily to 
the traditional prestige in New England of a college education and 
the institution that provides it. The stamp of the college’s approval 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
on the secondary school of a given community has long been held 
by that community to be the final test of the school’s excellence. 
Through bestowing their approval on the schools well equipped to 
fit for college and well taught, and withholding it from those ill 
equipped for this purpose and ill taught, the New England colleges 
have for many years been raising the standards of secondary instruc-- 
tion in these States. For the last 12 years a group of colleges, now 15 
in number, has acted in conjunction and established a joint clearing 
house for the approval of secondary schools, known as the New 
England College Entrance Certificate Board. This board approves 
schools which send a certain number of successful candidates to the 
constituent colleges and which satisfy the board of the adequacy of 
their equipment. Failure on the part of a certain number of the 
graduates of any school to do well in colleges belonging to the board 
causes the board’s approval of that school to be withdrawn. 
A place on the approved list of the board has come to be a much- 
coveted honor. While the board makes no attempt to investigate 
all the schools of New England and only rates those that apply for 
approval, and even though a negligible fraction of students may go 
from a given school to a New England college, nevertheless the com- 
munity feels that the standing of the school is not satisfactory unless 
it is on the board’s list. The entrance requirements of the colleges 
composing the board are, however, confined to a rather limited range 
of subjects; judged by the standards of the whole United States, 
they are conservative; hence the courses which schools must offer in 
order to secure inclusion in the list are somewhat restricted. 
Meanwhile the new movement in secondary education, which seeks 
to relate the work of the high school directly to the life of the com- 
munity which it serves, has spread throughout the country. The 
high school has already become in many sections ‘‘the people’s col- 
lege.” Its curriculum is now framed with reference to the large 
majority who do not, instead of the small minority who do, go to 
college. Practical subjects, vocational subjects, informational sub- 
jects not previously offered by colleges or allowed to count for college 
entrance, have been introduced into the high-school curriculum. 
Some of the State universities of the Middle West and West have met 
the movement more than half way. They have made their entrance 
requirements constantly more elastic and have granted entrance 
credit for a constantly increasing number of subjects. In fact, the 
articulation between the State university and the secondary schools 
is in some States so complete that a graduate of an approved high 
school who has taken any course of study recognized by the school 
authorities may enter without serious handicap some course in the 
State-supported college. The policy adopted by the State univer- 
sity is usually followed more or less closely by the private institu-
-P-A-G-E-203
  HIGHER EDUCATION 165 
tions of the same State. A very superficial comparison of the 
entrance requirements imposed by the best institutions in the West 
with those of colleges of correspondingly high rank in New England 
and the East, indicates that the eastern secondary schools have not 
received the same encouragement toward adaptation to the popular 
demands by the colleges of these older sections. 
Of late, however, the interests of the secondary schools in New 
England have received powerful support from another direction. 
The last decade has seen the increase in importance and authority of 
the State departments of education in these States. The New 
England departments of education have devoted especial attention 
to the problems of the high school. To study the needs of individual 
communities; to find the best method of devoting the cultural and 
practical resources of the high school to the community’s service; to 
break down the conservative prejudice against the ‘‘new studies;” 
and to give formal public recognition to good high-school work, 
whether this prepares for college or not, may summarize in brief their 
program. In carrying out this program they find the policy of the 
New England College Entrance Certificate Board and the superior 
value attached by many communities or school committees to its 
approval in their way. 
It is this dilemma that has led State Supt. Morrison, of New Hamp- 
shire, to urge the establishment of a State university in New Hamp- 
shire which shall serve New Hampshire as the University of Maine 
and the various State universities in other parts of the country are 
serving their States. These institutions have recognized, he says— 
that the high school should adapt itself to the work done by the lower schools for the 
great mass of the population, and that the colleges in their turn should adapt their 
work to what the high school has done. So only can we build for ourselves an educa- 
tional system which shall be both rational and democratic * * *. We need an 
institution in which there shall be a place for every boy and girl who is able to make 
his way in college and which shall never dare to raise any artificial and arbitrary 
obstacles in the pathway of education. I believe that the natural solution of the 
problem and indeed the only solution is the development of a true State university. 
in our midst. 
Supt. Morrison is known to have the support and approval of the 
other heads of education, offices in the New England States. 
In a circular letter published October 1, 1914, Prof. F. W. Nichol- 
son, the secretary of the New England College Entrance Certification 
Board, makes detailed reply to the criticisms of the board. He 
points out that as long as Harvard and Yale do not accept certifi- 
cates and are not members of the board, the board can not be said 
to dominate high-school education in New England: 
The board is concerned with just one thing—the reliability of a certificate. It has - 
nothing to say as to requirements for admission to college; these are determined by 
the colleges (members of the board) themselves.  
-P-A-G-E-204
166 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The aim of the constituent colleges is to prevent the admission to 
college on certificate of students not prepared for college work. 
Students from schools not on the board’s list of approved schools 
may always enter any of the colleges by passing the entrance 
examinations. 
CLASSIFICATION. 
There is evidence of a general change of attitude toward the 
vexed question of classification of colleges. The procedure of the 
administrative officials who have undertaken to classify is becoming 
more empirical. The officers of the classified institutions, on the 
other hand, are growing decidedly less suspicious. The two parties 
are coming to see the identity of their interests and to avoid, on the 
one side, the inscrutable and inexorable demeanor of a vehmic tri- 
bunal, and, on the other, the supersensitiveness to unfavorable criti- 
cism which has been common in the past. The inadequacy of any 
hard and fast definition to describe the great variety of colleges has 
become increasingly apparent. Every definition must be applied 
with discretion and should be elastic enough to allow certain devia-~ 
tions from strict orthodoxy. Classifying agencies are recognizing 
this. There is also a growing conviction among college executives 
of the ultimate value of honest and restrained statements concerning 
the equipment and performances of their institutions. They are 
beginning to perceive the benefits that will accrue from the recogni- 
tion of the defects of these institutions and to appreciate the fact 
that classifying bodies are friendly and not hostile forces. 
The question of classification now appears to have become by 
eommon consent the question of classifications. Colleges can, and 
doubtless should be, classified on several bases; in other words, with 
respect to their qualifications and equipment for various different 
purposes. The principal efforts at rating colleges within the year 
seem to point to a tendency to limit future classifications to distinct 
and homogeneous groups of institutions, or to specified categories of 
college work. This tendency is illustrated in the efforts toward 
classification mentioned in the following paragraphs. 
RECOGNITION OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE, 
State education officials in three States, acting under authority of 
law, have taken steps toward the recognition of the junior college 
and have suggested tentative working definitions of this type of 
institution. 
THE WISCONSIN, MISSOURI, AND VIRGINIA SCHEMES. 
As noted in the report of the Commissioner of Education for 1912, 
Wisconsin, in the preceding year, authorized its normal schools to 
give two years and no more of college work. The college depart-
-P-A-G-E-205
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. 167 
ments of these normal schools were thus in effect made junior colleges, 
The University of Wisconsin has now formally provided for their 
affiliation with it on such terms that normal-school students or 
graduates who were prepared to enter the university at the time of 
entering the normal school, and whose studies have been approved 
by the university faculty, may be transferred to the university with 
full credit. Thus the graduates of these normal schools receive junior 
standing in the colleges of letters and science, agriculture, and engi- 
neering, and are admitted to the law school or the medical school. 
In Missouri seven institutions giving part of the four years’ college 
course are affiliated with the State university as junior colleges. The 
university has issued detailed regulations for this affiliation, the most 
important of which are these: 
1. The requirements for admission to the work of the affiliated 
college must be the equivalent of those of the college of arts and science 
in the University of Missouri (15 units). 
2. If a preparatory school is maintained in connection with the 
college, its work must be approved by the University of Missouri. 
3. The course of study in the college must be 2 years in length and 
the college year 36 weeks. 
4. For graduation from the college the student must complete sat- 
isfactorily 60 semester hours of work, which must be the equivalent 
of that required in the first 2 years in the college of arts and science 
in the University of Missouri, including the courses prescribed for 
these years by the university. 
In addition, there must be adequate library and laboratory equip- 
ment, and a sufficient number of well-trained teachers devoting them- 
selves to specialties to insure work of college grade. 
The State Board of Education of Virginia, in its circular of informa- 
tion for 1914, concerning the certification of teachers, provides for 
granting a junior college certificate to— 
a graduate of a registered institution in Virginia which does not comply fully with 
the definition of a college, but which offers an approved four-year course at least 
two years in advance of the standard four-year high school, with one year’s work of 
college grade in English, history, mathematics, and science. 
This regulation obviously serves as a very general and tentative 
definition of a junior college. 
Much more thoroughgoing and specific prescriptions for the recog- 
nition of the junior college were adopted by the Virginia Association 
of Colleges and Schools for Girls, in June, 1913. The essential parts 
of the association’s definition are: 
That any school desiring rank as a junior college (a) shall agree to prefix the word 
“junior” when applying to itself the term ‘‘college’’; (b) shall have at least five 
instructors, each devoting himself to a single field; (c) shall fully meet the college 
entrance requirements for courses and examinations * * *; and (d) shall within 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
five years present at least three students whe gain by examination advanced stand- 
ing of not less than 2 years (30 hours) at some one of the standard colleges asked to 
cooperate with us in this process of standardization, namely, Vassar, Smith, Goucher, 
Wellesley, and Mount Holyoke. 
The committee on standardization, which formulated these regu- 
lations for the association, was continued and has been very success- 
ful in arranging for close and cordial cooperation with the standard 
women’s colleges just mentioned in testing the work of the junior 
colleges of Virginia. The action of the association, therefore, prom- 
ises to have considerable influence in determining the sphere and the 
range of the junior college not only in Virginia, but in other States 
as well. 
THE APPROVED LIST OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The recommendation by the Association of American Universities 
of a group of American colleges and universities to the Prussian 
Kultusministerium was in effect a classification of undergraduate 
institutions on the basis of their fitness to prepare students for gradu- 
ate study and research. The motives that actuated the association 
in recommending this list form an important part of the history of 
international educational relations. They are summarized briefly in 
the association’s report for 1913. 
In 1905 the University of Berlin memorialized the Association of 
American Universities to the effect that its faculty recognized every 
bachelor’s degree acquired at an American university as the equiva- 
lent of the German Maturitdtszeugnis. But the construction subse- 
quently placed by the University of Berlin upon this statement 
restricted its provisions to the institutions included in the Association 
of American Universities. The action of the University of Berlin 
was afterwards imitated by other Prussian universities and the uni- 
versities of Holland. In consequence only those American students 
who had won their bachelor’s degrees from institutions represented 
in the association were allowed to matriculate at Prussian and Dutch 
universities. 
Feeling that such discrimination was unjust to the other collegiate 
‘institutions of the United States, the association appointed a com- 
mittee to consider and report a remedy. The committee soon dis- 
covered that the task of making a list of the colleges of the country 
whose degrees might be regarded by the association as of equal value 
with the college degrees conferred by the universities embraced in 
its membership was impossible, with such machinery as the associa- 
tion itself had at hand. It therefore recommended that a list of 
accepted institutions be compiled to consist of the three following 
groups: :
-P-A-G-E-207
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. 169 
(1) The members, present and future, of the Association of American Universities. 
(2) Those other institutions on the accepted list of the Carnegie Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching. 
(3) Those institutions which are not included in the accepted list of the Carnegie 
Foundation because they are in some sense sectarian, as defined in the terms of gift 
of the fund, but otherwise conform to its standards of acceptability. 
At the request of the committee, the Carnegie Foundation fur- 
nished the names of the institutions mentioned under the last two 
headings. Including the 22 members of the association, 119 colleges 
and universities were named. The association then passed the fol- 
lowing resolution: 
Resolved, That this association recommend to the Prussian Kultusministerium and 
the corresponding ministries of the other German States that for the present there 
be recognized as the equivalent of the German Maturititszeugnis not only the bachelors’ 
degrees conferred by the members of this association, but also the degree of those 
other American colleges and universities which are on the accepted list of the Car- 
negie Foundation or which are certified by this foundation as of equivalent standing 
but excluded from its accepted list for other than educational reasons. 
THE NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION’S POLICY. 
The most radical and suggestive proposal with respect to classifi- 
cation offered within the year was that made by the commission of 
the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and 
adopted by the association at the meeting held in Chicago, March 21, 
1914. It will be remembered that the association several years ago 
set up certain standards for colleges and universities which consti- 
tuted a very detailed and specific definition of an acceptable college? 
under 12 heads (including admission and graduation requirements, 
faculty training, financial stability, equipment, and curriculum). The 
definition gained wide circulation not only in the territory of the 
association, but throughout the country. Some of its provisions 
were embodied in subsequent attempts elsewhere to define a stand- 
ard college. In 1913 the commission reported a list of 73 colleges in 
the territory of the association which conformed to the standards, 
and hence were eligible for membership in the association. 
The 1914 report alluded to above recommended a total change in 
the policy of the association. Because of the novelty of the pro- 
posal, certain paragraphs are here quoted verbatim: 
The present standards for colleges and universities were evidently drawn up with 
the college of arts and science as the chief if not the sule object of consideration. The 
association obviously has before it two possible courses. The present standards can 
be maintained and strengthened, when membership in the association will be lim- 
ited; or a policy of expansion can be adopted which will necessitate a modification of 
the standards and a thorough revision of the approved list. 
The small, exclusive membership seems at first sight to have certain advantages. 
The relation to high schools seems to be relatively simple. The association promises 
  
1 See Rep. of Commis. of Ed., 1913, Vol. I, pp. 20-21. 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
to be fairly homogeneous. The standards are relatively easy to enforce. On the 
other hand, it is to be noted that even the present small list includes institutions of 
widely different character. For example, about one-half of the institutions on the 
approved list pay their faculties less than $30,000 per annum, while at the other end 
of the list are institutions paying their faculties $500,000 or more. These figures show 
that in range of courses and in point of size the institutions now on the list differ very 
widely, so that the effort to keep relations within the association simple can hardly 
be expected to succeed. 
All these considerations led the commission to the recommendation which it now 
submits, that the list of approved institutions be enlarged. It is recommended that 
an alphabetical list of all institutions which continue the education of students beyond 
15 units of high-school work be prepared. Following the name of the institution 
shall be set down an exact statement of certain facts, such as the following: : 
(1) Number of the faculty in independent charge of classes. 
(2) Number of faculty with the degree of doctor of philosophy. 
(3) Number of matriculated students. 
(4) Number and type of degrees granted in course. 
(5) Number of elementary courses of instruction actually given. 
(6) Number of advanced courses. 
(7) Number of professional courses. 
(8) Expenditure for salaries. 
(9) Hours of class instruction required of members of the faculty. 
(10) Material equipment. 
This list shall then be submitted to the commission and the commission shall deter- 
mine its standards with the facts before it. Thus the commission shall determine 
the limits permitted in each of the categories above described. Furthermore, the 
categories which are deemed essential to admission to a classified list shall be deter- 
mined, and the list shall then be made up automatically, subject to annual review. 
The approved list and the facts which it presents shall be published. 
The commission does not, it will be observed, offer in this plan any definition of a 
junior college, nor does it distinguish between colleges and universities, or colleges 
and normal schools. It recommends rather a comprehensive formula, including all 
grades of institutions. It anticipates that the result of the adoption of this plan will 
be the ultimate development of a system of rating which may be used for high 
schools as well as for higher institutions. 
SURVEYS OF HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. 
Several important investigations in relation to the organization and 
management of higher institutions have been undertaken or com- 
pleted during the past year. Reference was made in the last report 
to the establishment by Mr. Andrew Carnegie, in January, 1913, of a 
division of educational inquiry in connection with the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The division is pro- 
vided with an endowment of $1,250,000, and under the terms of the 
gift is instructed to ‘carry on investigations concerning univer- 
sities, colleges, professional schools, and systems of education gen- 
erally,” and to make public such of its findings as the trustees of the 
Foundation may think valuable. 
THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION’S REPORT ON EDUCATION IN VERMONT, 
The opportunity was offered for the Foundation to put this new 
endowment to important use in an educational investigation more
-P-A-G-E-209
HIGHER EDUCATION, 171 
comprehensive than any before undertaken. A commission created 
in 1912 by the Legislature of Vermont ‘‘to inquire into the entire 
educational system and condition of the State,” requested the Car- 
negie Foundation to make a study of the educational situation in 
Vermont. The request was accepted, and the study began in March, 
1913. In addition to its own officers the foundation enlisted the serv- 
ices of members of the staffs of the University of Wisconsin, Columbia 
University, Harvard University, and the United States Bureau of 
Standards. A report was submitted to the commission and pub- 
lished by the foundation early in 1914, under the title “‘Education 
in Vermont.” Itis so notable a document that some account of that 
portion of its contents relating to higher education is appropriate. 
The inquiry attempts to give to the people of Vermont a picture 
of the educational system of the State as it exists to-day, with only 
so much history as is necessary to explain the present status of 
various educational agencies. Underlying the whole study, how- 
ever—in fact, basic to its recommendations—is a careful analysis of 
of the economic situation and needs and of the social constitution of 
the State itself. Upon this background the report has projected a 
view of education in Vermont as “‘one organism embracing the whole 
educational system from the elementary school to the university.” 
The commission, at whose instance the study was made, had not 
rendered its report to the legislature at the completion of the year 
reviewed in this chapter. It is therefore too early to say whether the 
recommendations of the Foundation will form the basis of legislative 
action. The most startling of these recommendations relate to 
higher education. 
After pointing out that the chief problem with which the State is 
concerned is the development of its elementary and secondary schools, 
and affirming that the proper solution of this problem entails (1) the 
reorganization of the elementary and secondary curricula to meet the 
vocational needs of the community; (2) provision for powerful and 
constructive central educational administration; and (3) more and 
better agencies for the training of teachers for elementary schools, 
the report makes the following comments on higher education: 
There are three institutions (University of Vermont, Middlebury College, Norwich 
University) that for years have been obtaining from the State treasury larger or smaller 
appropriations. In recent years these sums have grown rapidly, until at present the 
three colleges are receiving from the State something over $100,000 annually. In 
addition the State receives from the Federal Government for educational purposés 
$88,000. * * * 
The existing relation of the State to these colleges ought to cease. * * * 
The State should appropriate no money whatsoever to higher education until its 
duty toward the public schools has been fully met. In our judgment, the cause of 
higher education in Vermont would not suffer if it received no State aid in the future.  
-P-A-G-E-210
  172 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
This opinion is defended in the two paragraphs of the report which 
follow: 
There are only two consistent policies which a State can pursue toward institutions 
of higher education. It can give its support entirely to the elementary and secondary 
school work and leave higher education to be supported by public philanthropy. 
This is the situation in most of the New England States. Itis clear-cut; itis consistent; 
it is defensible both on the ground of public policy and of education. The other atti- 
tude is that assumed by the States of the Central West, of the far West, and of the 
South, namely, that higher education is likewise a function of the State and is entitled 
to State support, but that the State will appropriate money to no institution that it 
does not own and control.” This policy is also clear-cut and defensible, both educa- 
tionally and on the ground of a wise public policy. 
For Vermont the adoption of this second policy is encumbered with evident diffi- 
culties; Vermont can not possibly support a State university that seeks to cover the 
ordinary field of undergraduate and professional instruction. It is no burden for 
States like California, Illinois, Minnesota, or Wisconsin to appropriate $2,000,000 or 
even $5,000,000 annually to their State universities. The entire annual income of 
the State of Vermont is but little more than the sum which each of these States gives 
annually to its university. The most that the State of Vermont could possibly do, 
if it selected one of these subsidized institutions to become its State university, would 
be to help out the resources derived from the friends of education and of the institu- 
tion itself for the development of certain restricted fields of education which were 
deemed especially important to the State. Under such circumstances, however, it 
is fairly certain that State aid would check and eventually dry up the springs of 
private giving, and prove in the end an embarrassment rather than a help to higher 
education. 
These sections of the report have met with vigorous denial from 
President Thomas, of Middlebury College, in a statement in behalf of 
Middlebury College made to the commission to investigate the educa- 
tional system and conditions of Vermont. After indorsing the recom- 
mendations of the Foundation which deal with the development of the 
elementary-school system and the advisability of strong centralized 
control, President Thomas takes issue with the foundation on the 
question of State support for higher education. He declares: 
The assertion of the report is that the State is shut up to the dilemma either of abso- 
lute ownership and control of a State university, or complete severance from higher 
education. This is a dictum simply; it is not argued or defended. It appears to 
have been simply assumed from the practice of the Western States. 
To show that other policies than the two suggested in the report 
are often successful, he cites the cases of cooperation between the 
State and privately supported institutions in New York, Pennsyl- 
vania, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. He calls atten- 
tion to the mingling of State contributions and private benefactions 
in the support of the libraries, hospitals, and other public institutions 
of Vermont. He outlines at some length the English practice of com- 
bining public and private philanthropy in the support of higher edu- 
cation, and concludes this part of the argument with the remark: 
“A good many practices are practical and sensible in a given environ-
-P-A-G-E-211
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. 173 
ment which are not to the taste of men who have become accustomed 
to a different environment.” 
President Thomas bases these criticisms on the fact that the 
report— 
contains no study of the financial resources of Vermont, no comparison of the amount 
Vermont is expending for education, higher and lower, with the expenditures of 
other States of about the same income. It has simply assumed without examination 
that Vermont has a fixed amount to expend on education and is likely to have no 
more. 
He says that, even with the added appropriations necessary to 
support such an improved administration of the public schools as is 
recommended, the increasing resources of the State would still leave 
sufficient to give substantial aid to higher education. As a remedy 
for the harmful political activity which the report claims has char- 
acterized the efforts of Vermont colleges to secure appropriations 
in the past, he proposes that the new State board of education should 
be authorized to include in its budget of educational expenses such 
appropriations for the work of the colleges as may seem wise. The 
board could properly distribute the emphasis between the various 
parts of the educational system so that the higher institutions would 
not be favored beyond their deserts. 
SURVEY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
Some years ago a State board of public affairs was created in 
Wisconsin. The function of this board was to study and report upon 
the activities of the various public organizations which drew their 
support from the State. It recently ordered a survey of the Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin, and appointed Mr. William H. Allen, of the New 
York Bureau of Municipal Research, and Mr. E. C. Branson, of the 
University of North Carolina, as directors of the survey. These 
gentlemen, began their work in May, 1914. They have issued a series 
of carefully prepared questionnaires to the faculty members, alumni, 
and present students of the university. It is the avowed purpose of 
the survey to discover, by means of these questionnaires and by the 
personal observations of the directors, the answers to the 12 following 
suggested questions: 
1. What, if anything, is the University of Wisconsin undertaking that the State as 
a whole does not wish it to do? 
2. What, if anything, is the university failing to undertake which the State wishes 
it to do? 
3. Is the university doing well enough what it does? 
4. Is it doing inexpensively enough what it does? 
5. What parts of its work, if any, are adequately supported? 
6. What parts of its work are out of proportion—too large, too small—to its program 
as a whole? 
7. Is the State’s support of the university proportionate or disproportionate to 
State support of other public educational activities? 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
8. Is the university’s business management—in policy, planning, purchasing, 
supervising, checking, and reporting—adequate and efficient? 
9. Does the legislative policy in dealing with the university and other educational 
activities reflect adequate information and efficient use of information? 
10. What is the university’s relation with, and influence upon, the rest of the 
State’s system of public education? 
11. What are the standards of living, social and economic, in the university? 
12. What not-yet-met needs of the State which the university might meet and 
what opportunities for retrenchment or increased efficiency should be reported to the 
next legislature? 
THE STUDY OF INSTITUTIONS BY THEIR OFFICERS. 
The scientific self-survey tendency which may be said to have 
started with the Oberlin survey of 1908-9, commented on in previous 
reports, has gained considerable momentum. Each year sees an 
added number of progressive institutions undertaking to analyze 
some of the vital processes of college administration or teaching. 
This is one of the most important movements relating to college 
management. Through the multiplication of such partial surveys 
we shall perhaps eventually develop a real science of college adminis- 
tration. Two especially suggestive studies have been made within 
the past year. 
STUDY OF COSTS AT MIAMI. 
President R. M. Hughes, of Miami University, Ohio, read before 
the Ohio College Association, April 10, 1914, a paper on the per capita 
cost of instruction in the college of liberal arts as a measure of the 
efficiency of college administration. The study presents several 
interesting and original points of view which are supported by an 
effective marshaling of the figures relating to the cost of instruction 
at Miami and other institutions. 
President Hughes discusses the question whether it is possible to 
establish a per capita cost of instruction that may serve as a standard. 
Per capita cost is found to be a function, first, of the number of student 
hours per instructor (a student hour is the class instruction of one 
student one hour for a week), and, second, of the average salary 
of the instructor. How many student hours should an instructor 
teach a week? In all previous discussions of the load imposed upon 
teachers the number of the class hours a week has been emphasized; 
yet, if one instructor (of Greek, let us say) teaches 15 hours a week 
with an average of 6 students in each class, and another teaches the 
same number of hours with 25 students in each class, the second is 
giving more than four times as much instruction as the first. As a 
matter both of justice and good administration, the student hours 
should be distributed among instructors as evenly as possible. 
President Hughes proposed 275 as a fair load in student hours, 
this figure being approximately the average of those suggested 
by members of the Miami faculty. An analysis of the actual leads
-P-A-G-E-213
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. _ 445 
in student hours carried by members of this faculty showed a range of 
from 86 to 417, and an average of 214. With an ideal distribution of 
the teaching load, Miami could have cared for one-fourth more 
students than were actually taught and still have relieved certain 
members of the staff of an unreasonable burden. Although it was 
impossible to get the same accurate figures of the class enrollment 
from other institutions, such evidence as appears led President 
Hughes to believe that conditions at Miami are fairly typical. 
The other factor upon which the cost of instruction depends is the 
average salary of an instructor at Miami; it reaches the rather 
high figure of $1,718 a year. The number of weeks in the year, 
36, multiplied by 275 student-hours, produces approximately 
10,000 as the reasonable average load of student-hours a year for 
each instructor. If each instructor at Miami should teach 10,000 
student-hours a year, the cost of instruction per student-hour 
would be 17.18 cents; at this rate the total cost of instruction per 
student per year would be $91.77. Actually it costs $140 a year for 
the instruction of each student, an excess of $48.23 per student over 
the theoretical cost. President Hughes comments: 
If our administration were perfectly efficient and could maintain the college effec- 
tively and bring the average load up to the theory, there would be the difference 
between the actual cost and the theoretical cost, which might be divided in addi- 
tional salaries among a smaller faculty. Or, assuming, on the other hand, that the 
salaries are sufficiently high, a larger number of students could be educated for the 
same amount of money. 
To show that this discrepancy between the theoretical cost of 
instruction (using 275 student-hours as the student load for each 
instructor) and the actual cost is not an idiosyncrasy of Miami, 
President Hughes presents some figures relating to five small colleges 
of high standing and five of the largest universities in the country. 
From these it appears that an even greater divergence is not uncom- 
mon. President Hughes’s conclusion is— 
that.some cooperation between faculty and administration in securing a curriculum 
and a schedule and general administration of the academic work of the colleges would 
make a marked increase in the average student-hours per week taught by each in- 
structor, without overloading any, and a corresponding increase in salary. 
THE SURVEY OF THE DREXEL INSTITUTE. 
The desire to know the facts about the conditions, both financial 
and educational, existent during an interregnum of the presidency of 
the institution led the trustees of the Drexel Institute, in Phila- 
delphia, to seek the advice of an engineer experienced in the investi- 
gation of business and engineering operations, Dr. Hollis Godfrey. 
Dr. Godfrey’s report, submitted to the trustees in the fall of 1913, 
presented in addition to an analysis of the existing difficulties and of 
the possibilities of the institution so satisfactory a plan for its reor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
    BiG EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
ganization and future development that the trustees offered him, 
and he accepted, the presidency. Although the report has not been 
published, the bureau is able, through the courtesy of the officials of 
Drexel Institute, to indicate briefly some of its more striking 
recommendations. 
All are based upon a study of the educational and geographical 
field of the institute. This study answers the questions: What area 
does and can Drexel Institute serve? What classe of students does 
it and should it serve? What other institutions are offering or may 
offer similar lines of training? What courses now offered by Drexel 
Institute are clearly unprofitable for it to maintain, in view of the 
limited area of its constituency and the similar opportunities fur- 
nished by adjacent institutions? What courses should it emphasize 
and seek to perfect ? 
Among other recommendations made on the basis of this study 
was one that the institute, giving work of college grade, should 
obtain the right to grant degrees. 
In support of the recommendation the report calls attention to 
the change that has come about in the status of the technical school 
graduate in the last two decades. Twenty years ago the field of 
engineering operations was occupied chiefly by small concerns. It 
was undermanned, and employers were glad to get technically 
trained persons with or without a degree. Now the typical employer 
is the large corporation. Both corporation and governmental 
bodies have generally adopted what amounts to a civil-service test, 
often open only to degree holders, and there are more degree holders, 
both actually and relatively, than in the early nineties. Graduates 
of Drexel Institute, having no degrees, find themselves now at a dis- 
advantage with graduates of other technical schools in applying for 
positions. Similar conditions have recently led the Armour Insti- 
tute, of Chicago, and the Carnegie Institute, of Pittsburgh, to grant 
degrees. 
After having gained the right to grant degrees (it has since been 
secured), the report goes on to say that the Drexel Institute should 
so concentrate its resources and perfect its organization as to conform 
eventually to the following definition: 
Drexel Institute is composed of a school of engineering for men, a school of domestic 
science and arts for women, and a secretarial school for women, meeting the needs 
of the high-school graduate of Philadelphia and of the commuting area around Phila- 
delphia by means of high-grade technical instruction in the lines mentioned above, 
and providing special technical courses of less than college grade for those irregularly 
trained men of mature years who can not obtain instruction of this type in the high 
schools. 
Believing that the curtailment or abolition of some departments 
of the institution to meet this prescription should be done gradually,
-P-A-G-E-215
  HIGHER EDUCATION, 177 
the report offers valuable recommendations in tabular view concern- 
ing the external and internal policies and administration. In the 
case of each school or department these recommendations were 
based upon a study of the expenditure of the school for five years 
compared with the enrollment for five years. 
In the ease of the library school this study involved the positions 
open for five years in the general field of library practice, the receipts 
from tuition and the cost of salaries and disbursements, the total 
numbers in the school for five years, and the numbers from the 
metropolitan district of Philadelphia for five years. This last figure 
was of special importance, as the institute in all its publications 
gives notice that a boy or girl from greater Philadelphia will be given 
a preference over a boy or girl-from outside greater Philadelphia. 
The accompanying charts present graphically the facts which the 
study of the library-school disclosed. They serve also as an admi- 
rable illustration of this method of reporting significant college sta- 
tistics. 
Finally, the report takes up the questions of costs and shows how 
the deficit of the past years may be avoided by a concentration of 
departments, scientific budget making, and more equal distribution 
of student-hours among instructors in the manner suggested by the 
Miami study cited above. The officers of the institute aré now 
putting into practice as rapidly as possible the recommendations 
embodied in this constructive report. 
ACTION OF EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 
The wide adoption of the “unit” as a measure of secondary work 
and college preparation has helped to make possible the establishment 
of definite and intelligible standards for graduation from the high 
school and for admission to college. The “unit” is, however, a 
quantitative measure, with only incidental reference to quality. 
This appears to be its chief defect. 
Certain difficulties in its application have become evident already. 
There is, on the one hand, a tendency to overemphasize the time 
aspect of the unit, to regard it as so many minutes of school work. 
The commonly accepted definition which states that the “unit repre- 
sents a year’s study in any subject * * * constituting approxi- 
mately a quarter of a full year’s work,” and the further explanations 
that this assumes “that a period is from 40 to 60 minutes in length 
and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week,” are 
intended to guard against a strictly mathematical-interpretation of 
the unit. Nevertheless, the temptation to measure all school work 
in terms of minutes still gains many victims. Indeed, some of the 
critics of the unit itself as a standard of measurement complain 
chiefly of its vicious flexibility and lack of temporal precision.

THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS. 
The other difficulty lies in the scheme of unit values adopted by 
the College Entrance Examination Board and the National Confer- 
ence Committee on Standards of Colleges and Secondary Schools. 
As these values have received a longer trial, it has become increas- 
ingly apparent that certain modifications, especially in the weight of 
the units in algebra and history, are probably in order. 
To ascertain the extent to which the schools hold this conviction, 
the National Conference Committee sent out to the principals and head- 
masters of 500 schools a list of questions concerning the number of 
recitation periods per week devoted to algebra and history and the 
place of these subjects in the school curriculum. On the strength of 
the replies received the two following topics were placed for special 
consideration upon the program of the meeting of the National Con- 
ference Committee held in New York February 28: 
1. Shall the present unit values of 14 for elementary algebra and 1 for history be 
changed? 
2. Shall the committee recommend a different valuation for units in the earlier and 
later parts of the school course, or shall it issue an explanatory statement that will 
make clear the difference between work in the different years and that will guard 
against a too literal interpretation of the unit? 
As a result of the information received from the schools that had 
been circularized, the conference committee voted to send the fol- 
lowing circular letter to the members of its constituent bodies: 
In spite of the marked progress toward uniformity in college entrance credits, this 
committee is informed of certain recurring difficulties in administration. It appears, 
for example, from our general inquiry concerning the subject, that elementary algebra 
is usually given more time than is represented by the unit and a half of credit given 
to this subject and that certain branches of history are usually given less time than 
is represented by the unit of credit that they receive. There is, on the other hand, 
a tendency toward a strictly mechanical interpretation of the units, even to the point 
of counting minutes, which emphasizes the letter rather than the spirit of a system 
of merely approximate measures. 
The committee realizes the importance of recommending as few changes in the 
regulations as possible, but it believes that it will be of service if the organizations 
that it represents will consider and report to the committee their official judgment or 
the attitude of their members toward the following suggestions: 
(a) That the unit credits assigned to the subjects of elementary algebra and history 
be modified so as to represent more nearly the amount of time given to these subjects. 
(b) That in certain subjects—as, for example, history—the amount vf credit to be 
assigned should not be uniform in all cases, but should vary with the time and 
attention given. 
(c) That some distinction be made between the amount of credit that is given to 
subjects taken in the early years of the high school and those taken in the later years. 
(d) That there be adopted some uniform plan of limiting the number of subjects in 
which credit may be gained in order that continuity of work may be secured in at 
least two subjects.

THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 
The Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Asso- 
ciation rendered its report to the House of Delegates of the American 
Medical Association June 22-25, 1914. Two years ago the council 
was instructed by the house of delegates to omit from class A (of its 
classification of medical colleges) after January 1, 1914, any medical 
college which did not require for admission at least one year of 
collegiate work in addition to the standard four-year high-school 
education, the additional year to include college courses in physics, 
chemistry, biology, and the modern languages. The council has 
since voted to work toward the legal enforcement by State licensing 
boards of college courses in physics, chemistry, and biology. For: 
the present it believes that a modern language should not be made a 
legal requirement. Medical colleges should, nevertheless, be urged 
to adopt it. Eighty-two medical colleges have met this standard 
and are already requiring for admission one or more years of collegiate 
work or have announced their intentions of doing so, beginning 
October 1, 1914. Of these, 37 have adopted the standard of two or 
more years of college work.! 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
Changes in entrance requirements have been alluded to. Those 
announced by the United States Military Academy, the regents of 
the University of the State of New York, and Yale University affect 
such large numbers of young men and women as to be especially 
worthy of mention. 
ADMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY ON CERTIFICATE. 
In January, 1914, the War Department issued general orders pro- 
viding that a candidate for admission to the United States Military 
Academy might thereafter be excused from taking the mental entrance 
examination if he complied with certain stated conditions. Before 
the end of March a large number had qualified under the terms of the 
general orders and were admitted to the academy without mental 
examination. But it appeared that the terms of exemption were in 
some respects too liberal. The War Department therefore rescinded 
the order of January 23, and on May 22, 1914, issued General Orders, 
No. 38, which provide for the exemption from mental examination 
for admission to the United States Military Academy upon one of 
the following conditions: 
1. Thathe presenta properly attested certificate that he isa regularly enrolled student 
in good standing without condition in any university, college, or technological school 
accredited by the United States Military Academy, provided that the entrance require-

ments for the course he is pursuing in such institution require proficiency in subjects 
amounting to 14 units of the College Entrance Examination Board, which must include 
mathematics A, (algebra to quadratics), A, (algebra, quadratics and beyond), and © 
(plane geometry); English A (reading and practice) and B (study and practice), as 
outlined by the College Entrance Examination Board. A certificate indicating enroll- 
ment at an irregular time or for the specific purpose of obtaining such certificate will 
not be accepted. 
2. That he present a properly attested certificate of graduation from a preparatory 
school or public high school which is on the accredited list of one of the institutions 
referred to in paragraph 1 of this order, provided that he is thus certified to have estab-

CHANGE IN THE REQUIREMENT FOR NEW YORK REGENTS’ COLLEGE ENTRANCE 
DIPLOMAS. 
College entrance diplomas in arts and in science were formerly 
issued by the regents of the University of the State of New York to 
pupils in recognized high schools who earned 72 specified academic 
counts. A regent’s count is one of four or five subjects pursued 1 
day a week for 45 minutes a day during 88 weeks. Upon the recom- 
mendation of the Association of Colleges in the State of New York 
and the State Examinations Board the requirements for these diplomas 
have been reduced to 70 counts. A new college entrance diploma in 
engineering, also requiring 70 counts, is added. The distribution of 
requirements for each of the older diplomas has been slightly modified, 
as indicated in the following paragraphs: 
For the college entrance diploma in arts the new requirement allows the 30 counts 
prescribed in foreign language to be made up either of Latin 20 counts and a second 
foreign language 10 counts, or, at the option of the student, of 15 counts in Latin and 15 
in a second foreign language. The electives are reduced from 12 to 10 counts. 
For the college entrance diploma in science the requirement in science is reduced 
from 10 to 5 counts. The requirement in the first (of two) foreign language is raised 
from 10 to 15 counts, making a total of 25 counts of foreign language, instead of the 20 
counts formerly prescribed. The electives are reduced from 12 counts to 10 counts, 
The college entrance diploma in enginecring is granted for the satisfactory comple- 
tion of English, 13 counts; algebra, 7 counts; plane geometry, 5 counts; history, 5 
counts; Latin, French, or German, 15 counts; physics, 5 counts; a second science, 5 
counts; advanced mathematics, 5 counts; electives, 10 counts.

MODIFICATIONS OF YALE’S ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
Yale University has long represented the conservative party in 
the matter of entrance requirements. Admission has been strictly 
by examination. The range of subjects required for the A. B. course 
has been limited to those which have been proved by long experience 
to furnish valuable training for a classical college curriculum. Less 
work in classics and more mathematics and science are required for 
admission to the Sheffield Scientific School, but the plan is otherwise 
the same as for the A.B. course. In the catalogue of 1913-14 appears 
a very brief announcement under the heading, “Special cases where 
good preparation differs from fixed requirement,” which indicates a 
new departure. Under this plan it will be possible for good students 
whose preparation has not coincided absolutely with the prescribed 
entrance requirements to enter the college or the scientific school. 
The catalogue states: 
The committees on admission are prepared to consider the application made by a 
school principal on behalf of a final candidate who, during his preparatory course, has 
shown unusual ability and maintained a high grade of scholarship, but whose subjects 
of study have differed somewhat from those prescribed for admission to the undergradu- 
ate departments of Yale University. 
NEW FOUNDATIONS AND REORGANIZATIONS. 
CHANGES AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. 
Two of the departments of Columbia University which have previ- 
ously given chiefly undergraduate instruction begin the year 1914-15 
as graduate departments. 
The school of mines, which celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 
May, 1914, becomes now the graduate school of engineering on the 
same footing as the other graduate schools of the university. Three 
years of specialized professional study will be offered, leading to the 
several technical degrees granted in the schools of mines, engineering, 
and chemistry. For admission to these courses the completion of at 
least three years of a college or scientific school course, including 
work in mathematics, physics, chemistry, drafting, shopwork, sur- 
veying, and mineralogy will be required. A new course leading to 
the degree of B. 8., which may be completed in three years, ‘‘ without 
undue strain,” has been organized at Columbia College, as preparation 
for the advanced work of these new graduate departments. 
The school of education of Teachers College announced in the spring 
of 1914 that beginning July 1, 1914, it would abandon all undergradu- 
ate courses leading to the degree of B. 8. and become a graduate 
school, offering only advanced curricula leading to the degree of 
A.M. or Ph.D. The new requirement for admission to the school is 
a bachelor’s degree from an approved college or its equivalent. The 
announcement states:
-P-A-G-E-221
  
HIGHER EDUCATION, 183 
This reorganization has been made in response to a widespread demand throughout 
the country for increased preparation on the part of high-school teachers of academic 
subjects and for opportunities for thorough training for such responsible positions as 
school superintendent, principal of a high school, principal of a normal school, head of 
a college or university department of education, critic teacher, primary supervisor, 
educational investigator, school statistician, and so forth. That preparation for work 
of this type must be of a graduate character is without question. Only students with 
broad academic and professional training in advance of the usual undergraduate courses 
can hope to meet the present demands in this better class of positions. 
THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
Provisions for the scientific training of teachers in the East have 
been still further increased during the last academic year by the ex- 
pansion of the work in education at the University of Pennsylvania. 
The department of education at the University of Pennsylvania, 
which was started in 1894, was considerably increased in 1913 by 
means of financial assistance granted by the Pennsylvania Legis- 
lature. The chair of pedagogy was divided into three professorships: 
Prof. A. Duncan Yokum retained the chair of educational research 
and practice, Dr. Harlan Updegraff being elected professor of edu- 
cational administration, and Dr. Frank P. Graves professor of the 
history of education. In the spring of 1914 the expanded depart- 
ment was reorganized as the school of education, a separate depart- 
ment of the university. A special faculty with Dr. Graves as dean 
was selected. The requirements for admission to the new school are 
similar to those of the college and presuppose graduation from a 
first-class high school. A four-year course of study will lead to the 
degree of bachelor of science in education. 
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN HARVARD AND THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE 
OF TECHNOLOGY. 
The proposal to consolidate with the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology those departments of Harvard University granting de- 
grees in applied science is not new. It was first made in 1870, but 
no satisfactory agreement could then be reached. The question 
was raised for the second time in 1897. Again in 1904 the matter 
was broached and after extensive negotiations dropped once more. 
The removal of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 
near future to the extensive plant now being constructed in Cam- 
bridge has emphasized anew the wastefulness and unwisdom of the 
competition between the two institutions. The fourth attempt to 
bring about a plan of cooperation has met with success. The agree- 
ment was approved by the Harvard corporation on December 29, 
1913, and by the Technology corporation on January 12,1914. In 
his annual report for the year 1912-13, President Lowell gives the 
following brief résumé of the new plan: 
The agreement * * * provides for complete cooperation in the teaching of 
mechanical, electrical, civil and sanitary engineering, mining and metallurgy, in the
-P-A-G-E-222
      184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
buildings of Technology, now under construction on the Charles River embankment 
in Cambridge. Each institution is to contribute such sums as it can, and in particular 
Harvard is to use for the purpose the income of the funds of the Lawrence Scientific 
School and three-fifths of the income of the McKay endowment, the remaining two- 
fifths being required for other branches of science useful to man not included in the 
agreement. The fees of students, for the present at least, are to be credited to the 
two institutions in the proportion of their students in the subjects covered by the 
agreement at the time it was made. 
Appropriations for any purpose must be approved by the institution that supplies 
the funds used; but by far the most important of all appropriations are those for salaries, 
and they depend on the appointment of the teaching staff, for which a special procedure 
is provided. All professors, associate and assistant professors—that is, all the in- 
structors of superior grade, all those who sit in the faculty for the departments to 
which the cooperation extends—can be appointed by the institution that pays their 
salaries only after consultation with the other. All these officers, now existing or 
hereafter appointed, are to have the titles and privileges of their rank in both institu- 
tions; and all their students registered at Technology, unless they signify a contrary 
intent, are to be entitled to the rights and privileges of students in the professional 
schools of the University, and deemed candidates for its degrees * * *. By the 
arrangement thus made, the higher instructors in the subjects mentioned are pro- 
fessors both of Harvard and Technology, and the students in those subjects will, nor- 
mally, be students in both, receive degrees from both, and become graduates of both. 
The conduct of the instruction covered by the agreement is intrusted to the presi- 
dent of the Institute—in whose selection the president of the University is to have a 
consultative voice—and to the faculty of the Institute, consisting of all the joint pro- 
fessors and all others teaching at Technology subjects not included in the cooperation. 
This faculty is to regulate, according to the directions given to it by the respective 
corporations, the courses of instruction leading to their separate degrees; and con- 
ceivably the two institutions might prescribe different requirements, although no 
such divergence is contemplated. 
THE MUNICIPAL UNIVERSITY OF AKRON. 
The present year has seen the establishment of the Municipal 
University at Akron, Ohio, under the Ohio act permitting the founda- 
tion and support of universities as part of the public educational 
systems of cities. The Akron city council voted, on September 24, 
1913, to take over the property of Buchtel College and use it as the 
nucleus for the new Municipal University of Akron. Buchtel College 
was founded in 1870, under the joint auspices of John R. Buchtel 
and the Ohio Universalist Convention. For many years it drew its 
students largely from denominational sources. In the last two 
decades, however, the denominational support has gradually de- 
clined. Meanwhile, the college drew an increasing number of 
students from the city of Akron. In 1912-13 the percentage of the 
student body coming from the city was 62. The decline in outside 
financial support coupled with this amazing increase in local students, 
induced the trustees to propose that the city of Akron take over the 
property of the college and through the support of city funds endow 
it with new life. The proposals of the trustees were:
-P-A-G-E-223
HIGHER EDUCATION. 185 
First. That the city of Akron will devote perpetually the funds and plant thus 
turned over to it, to the uses of a municipal college or university, to be called the 
College (or University) of Akron, with the understanding that in case of the develop- 
ment of several colleges, schools, or departments, the department of liberal arts shall 
retain the name of ‘‘Buchtel College of Liberal Arts.” 
Second. That the city will provide for the maintenance and growth of the institution 
within such limits as may be provided for by law. 
Third. That the government of the institution shall be under the control of a separate 
board of trustees to be chosen and perpetuated by municipal authority in such manner 
as may be now or hereafter provided by law, with the provision, however, if the law 
permit, that fitting representation on the board of trustees be assured to the alumni. 
In agreeing to these proposals the council of the city of Akron 
voted to levy a tax of five-tenths of 1 mill for the support of the 
institution. 
The Municipal University of Akron starts the year 1914-15 with 
departments of arts, cooperative engineering, and home economics. 
It maintains also a department of civic cooperation, which includes 
a bureau of city tests and a bureau of industrial chemical research. 
DELAWARE COLLEGE FOR WOMEN. 
By an act of the Delaware Legislature of 1913, Delaware College 
was reincorporated and came under the sole possession of the State. 
From 1870, when it was designated by the legislature as beneficiary 
under the Morrill act, and so became the land-grant college of Dela- 
ware, until 1913 it had existed under combined private and State 
ownership. 
More significant still, for the future development of higher educa- 
tion in Delaware, was the appropriation by the same legislature of 
$30,000 annually, for five years, for the erection and equipping of a 
college for women, affiliated with Delaware College. Thus, for the 
first time, Delaware provides opportunities for the higher education. 
of girls within its own borders. There is now but one State left in 
the Union—New Jersey—in which there is no college open to women. 
The new affiliated college for women occupies a site of its own, 
about a mile and a quarter from Delaware College. It is under the 
control of the same board of trustees and will, for the time being, 
share in the services of the faculty of Delaware College. The inten- 
tion is, however, to build up a separate faculty for women as the 
needs of the institution increase. The board has borrowed a sufli- 
cient sum of money on the strength of the annual appropriations to 
complete the buildings for the opening of the affiliated college in the 
fall of 1914. 
THE VANDERBILT CASE. 
The changes which have taken place in the control of Vanderbilt 
University as the result of a recent decision of the Supreme Court 
of Tennessee have attracted the attention not only of educators all 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  186 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
over the country, but of church bodies and the secular press as well. 
There is still some difference of opinion between the two parties to 
the controversy as to what are the essential facts in the case. Those 
recited below are, however, recognized by the official organs of both 
parties to have been largely influential. 
The cause of the difficulty between the board of trust of Vanderbilt 
University and the general conference of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church South appears to date from the year 1905, when the board 
of trust rescinded its by-law passed in 1894, by which the bishops 
were made ex officio members of the board, and instead elected 
directly five senior bishops. In the same year the board of trust 
endeavored to procure a new charter. This effort was defeated by 
the activities of certain officials of the church. 
As a result of this disagreement, in 1906 the general conference 
appointed a commission of five laymen to ‘‘determine the relation of 
Vanderbilt University to the Methodist Episcopal Church South,” 
and to outline the rights of the two bodies with relation to one 
another. 
The commission rendered a report, the principal decisions of which 
became later the subject of court action. They are thus summa- 
rized by the Vanderbilt University Quarterly: + 
The commission held (1) that the petitioners who applied for and obtained the 
charter of Vanderbilt University were not the members of the corporation, but that 
certain annual conferences were the members thereof; (2) that Mr. Vanderbilt was 
not the founder, but the founders were the annual conferences represented at the 
Memphis convention; ? (3) that since 1898 the general conference, as assignee of the 
annual conferences, was the sole member of the corporation; (4) that the trustees were 
and are the agents of the conference; (5) that the bishops were not members of the 
corporation, but that they were common-law visitors with veto powers. 
The general conference of 1910 accepted the report of this com- 
mission and endeavored to secure the agreement of the board of 
trust to its findings. Upon the refusal of the board of trust to concur 
the general conference proceeded to elect three trustees to fill vacan- 
cies existing on the board of trust, thus making a test case of the 
commission’s report. (Previously trustees had been elected by the 
board and confirmed by the general conference.) 
The board of trust refused to seat the members thus elected. It 
elected three others to fill the vacancies and rescinded the by-law of 
1908, by which the names of trustees elected by the board must be 
submitted to the general conference for confirmation. 
The bishops then filed an original bill in the chancery court of 
Davidson County, Tenn., for the October term of 1910, praying that

2 The delegates of six annual conferences of the church met at Memphis in January, 1872, and after three 
days’ discussion, adopted nine resolutions, known as the Memphis resolutions, looking to the establishment 
of a university.
-P-A-G-E-225
  
HIGHER EDUCATION, 187 
the court enjoin the board of trust from seating the new members. 
The trustees filed an answer denying the right of the church to elect 
trustees and the right of the bishops to exercise supervision over the 
university, and maintaining that the church never had possessed any 
rights in the university. 
The case came to trial in December, 1912, and in February, 1913, 
the chancellor rendered a decision sustaining the bishops at every 
point. The trustees immediately took an appeal to the Supreme 
Court of Tennessee. 
While the appeal was pending Mr. Andrew Carnegie offered 
$1,000,000 for the medical department of the university, $800,000 © 
of it being contingent upon the winning of the suit by the trustees. 
The bishops, exercising the power they claimed of veto over the 
action of the trustees, repudiated the gift. The board of trust, how- 
ever, refused to recognize this action. 
The supreme court rendered its decision on March 21, 1914. The 
principal points made were thus oo in the Nashville Christian 
Advocate, March 27, 1914: 
The members of the committees appointed by the various annual conferences and 
making up the Memphis convention in 1872 did not meet as representatives of the 
annual conferences, but as mere individuals.! 
Mr. Vanderbilt, and not the annual conferences nor the church, was the founder and 
original patron of this institution. 
The church does not own any part of Vanderbilt University. The only relation is 
one of ‘‘affiliation and influence.”’ 
No visitorial powers rest in the college of bishops. 
The general conference of 1910, when it undertook to elect members of the board, 
was not acting within its rights, and its appointees are not entitled to seats in that 
board. The board of trust in 1910, inrescinding its by-laws and electing three trustees, 
was not acting within its rights; but the three trustees are entitled to their seats, 
subject to the general conference. 
The contract or by-law relation of the general conference would ‘‘cease” should the 
general conference ‘‘voluntarily surrender * * * or contumaciously refuse to 
confirm members elected and cease to cooperate with the university.’”’ Then the 
right to representation on the board of trust would cease, ‘‘and in that event the 
board of trust could proceed independently of the general conference to fill vacancies 
in its own body.” 
The general conference, meeting in Oklahoma City in May, 1914, 
adopted unanimously a series of resolutions which rehearsed the 
history of the controversy between the board of trust and the con- 
ference and recommended the appointment of a commission, to be 
known as the educational commission of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church South. This commission was instructed, among other 
things, to reconvey to the patronizing annual conferences such 
authority over the university as belongs to the general conference; 
with the recommendation also that the patronizing conterences insti-

but a group of individuals.

  188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
tute legal proceedings to obtain their rights of ownership and control 
of the university, the expenses of litigation to be paid by the board 
of education of the general conference of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church South. 
The resolutions further provide tor the transfer to the general 
board of education of all the rights of the general conference to con- 
firm persons elected to membership in the board of trust at the uni- 
versity. 
The resolutions finally instruct the commission to— 
: consider and determine the advisability and wisdom of establishing an institution or 
institutions of higher education of the grade of a university for and on behalf of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church South, it being the intention of the general conference 
to, and it does hereby, confer upon the said commission authority to establish and 
provide for the location, maintenance, and endowment of an institution or institu- 
tions of higher education, and to establish and provide for the location, maintenance, 
and endowment of a school or schools of theology, with full power and authority in 
this regard to act for and on behalf of this general conference as fully and freely as 
it acts or would act foritself. * * *. If said commission shall determine to establish 
such institution or institutions of learning, it shall take such steps as are necessary to 
incorporate the same, so as to secure to the Methodist Episcopal Church South the 
ownership and control of the same in perpetuity. 
The adoption by the conference of these resolutions was held by 
the university, and was evidently intended by the conference itself, 
to be tantamount to severing the relations existing between the 
university and the general conference. 
NEW TENDENCIES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION—THEIR BEARING ON 
THE ARTS CURRICULUM. 
In the summary at the head of the chapter allusion was made to the 
growing sentiment in favor of the prescribed and carefully coordinated 
course of study as. a foundation both for general culture and for 
diversified specialization. The recent application of this idea in the 
field of engineering education, with certain modifications due to the 
special demands of the profession, is interesting in this connection. 
The training of the technical specialist, the engineer ready to earn his 
livelihood by the practice of his profession, is in certain institutions 
being relegated to the graduate school, or at least to the latter part 
of the baccalaureate course. The undergraduate course, at least for 
the earlier years, is devoted to general preparation in the sciences 
fundamental to all branches of engineering and in other subjects 
held to be essential to a liberal education. Thus the undergraduate 
course in engineering loses its strictly professional cast. It becomes 
one solution of the problem of general education. Perhaps the best 
known exponent of this tendency is the new engineering department 
of Johns Hopkins University, established with the aid of the liberal ap- 
propriations made by the legislature of Maryland in 1912. During
-P-A-G-E-227
HIGHER EDUCATION. 189 
the first three years of the four-year course the program of studies 
is uniform for all students. Specialization in mechanical, civil, elec- 
trical engineering, etc., occurs only in the last year of the course. 
An argument in favor of this new policy, together with a defense of 
engineering education as general liberalizing training, was presented 
by Dean Gardner C. Anthony, of the Tufts College engineering 
school, in his address as president of the Society for the Promotion 
of Engineering Education at Princeton, in June, 1914. A general 
undifferentiated course in engineering during the first three years 
similar to the Johns Hopkins plan has been in operation for several 
years at Tufts, under Dean Anthony’s direction. 
Dean Anthony recalled the development of the engineering courses 
as offshoots of the A. B. courses. While the parent colleges have 
run to unlimited or only slightly hampered election, the engineering 
schools have followed the same impulse and have run to minute 
specialization. The subdivision and insulation of engineering 
courses has now proceeded altogether too far. Engineering schools 
must in the future return to somewhere near the pomt whence they 
and the arts colleges set out. They must find a program which will 
educate the man. The development of the specialist may and should 
be left to the graduate school or to experience. 
Moreover, the cultural end may be gained without substantial 
loss of technical and specialized preparation if a proper coordination 
and correlation of the work of the various departments is secured. 
The affinity between pattern making and English, for instance, is 
not commonly noted by the instructors of these two subjects. It 
escapes the attention of the lay observer. Nevertheless it exists. 
In fact, departmental independence and self-sufficiency, depart- 
mental blindness to points of contact with other fields of knowledge, 
are the greatest handicaps to the development of both general and 
special courses. By close cooperation between the several depart- 
ments and engineering school as well, the college of arts may become 
a kind of ‘composite Mark Hopkins,” and a more effective instru- 
ment both for general and special training. 
RESIGNATIONS AND ELECTIONS. 
Among the many changes in executive positions, mention is made 
here only of those affecting State universities and colleges: 
President Arthur H. Wilde, of the University of Arizona, resigned September 1,

department of psychology at De Pauw University and for the last two years associate 
superintendent of the Indiana Reformatory. 
President James H. Baker, of the University of Colorado, retired on the ist of Janu- 
ary, 1914, and was succeeded by Prof. Livingston Farrand, of the department of 
anthropology at Columbia University.

CHAPTER VIII. 
PROGRESS OF THE YEAR IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
By N. P. Cotwet, M. D., 
Secretary of the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, Chicago, Iil. 
  Progress in the last 12 months—Present status—Colleges having higher entrance require- 
ments—State requirements of higher preliminary education—Financial aid to medical colleges—Closer 
relations with hospitals—Development by limitation—Helps in the general progress—Other im} 
ments by licensing boards—Standards of medical praciice—Relation of medicine to general education— 
Entrance to college by examination—Thorough and reliable examinations essential—A dministration 
of entrance requirements—Choice of a medical school—Medical knowledge more extensive and com- 
plete—State requirements more exacting—Nonrecognition of medical colleges—All-time clinical pro- 
fessors—Graduate courses in public health—Graduate medical instruction—In conclusion.    
The rapid and remarkable improvement which medical education 
has been undergoing during the past 10 years has not diminished dur- 
ing the past 12 months. There has been a further decrease in the 
vast oversupply of medical colleges possessed by this country in 
1904. Of the colleges remaining a still larger number (85 per cent) 
have put into effect higher standards of preliminary education for 
admission (one or more years of collegiate work); more salaried 
expert teachers have been employed; endowments have been greatly 
increased; new buildings have been erected; new laboratories have 
been provided; closer relations have been established between the 
medical colleges and hospitals; and much better opportunities for 
medical students to study and observe the treatment of the sick have 
been provided. Medical education has indeed been greatly improved, 
while at the same time the opportunities for students to secure a 
thorough training in the latest and best methods of diagnosis and 
treatment, as well as in disease prevention, have been markedly 
increased. The diminution in the number of medical colleges, 
therefore, has resulted in the development of a better quality without 
in any way restricting the opportunities for those who are well quali- 
fied to study medicine. 
In addition to the improvements immediately within the medical 
colleges, medical education has been greatly improved by the estab- 
lishing of better means for postgraduate medical instruction; better 
courses in preventive medicine, public health, ete., for the training 
of those who are to become health officers; and a larger provision 
financially and otherwise for medical research, by which many new

facts will be added to the knowledge regarding the causation, diag- 
nosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Again, laws have been 
secured in a number of States providing for a better regulation of 
medical practice, for higher standards of preliminary education, 
and for better methods of examination. 
On the other hand, as this report will show, there still remain 
serious needs to be met before medical education in the United States 
will be on a par with that of other first-class nations, and before the 
people of this country will be safe from the menace of incompetent 
and unqualified practitioners of the healing art. 
PRESENT STATUS OF MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
The numbers of medical colleges, students, and graduates have 
still further decreased during the past year. This is a continuation 
of the expected reaction following the greatly inflated enrollments 
in the vast oversupply of medical colleges possessed by this country 
in 1904, when over half of the world’s supply were in the United 
States. In fact, to those who are fully acquainted with the low edu- 
cational standards held by a large majority of the medical colleges in 
1904, the reduction in the number of medical students from 28,142 
to 16,502, of medical graduates from 5,747 to 3,594, and of medical 
| colleges from 162 to 101, gives evidence of marked improvement and 
in every sense reasons for congratulation rather than alarm. For 
example, among the thousands who graduated annually from medi- 
cal colleges in and prior to 1904, very few had secured a good pre- 
liminary education, shown by the possession of degrees from colleges 
of liberal arts, while 817, or 22.7 per cent, of those graduating in 1914 
were also graduates of standard colleges of arts and sciences.?

The clearness with which the public now understands the condi- 
tions and needs of medical education is shown by the following 
concise newspaper comment regarding the reductions in the numbers 
of medical colleges, students, and graduates during the last 10 years. 
Says the Chicago Journal: 
Thirty years ago any ambitious youngster who had the price could find some 
“college” ready to fit him out with the magic letters ‘‘M. D.’’—ofttimes after a 
“course of study” so petty that a plumber’s apprenticeship was a liberal education 
by comparison. To-day most of these diploma mills have been closed—though a 
few continue to do business at the old stand, and to send forth wretchedly unprepared 
men to undertake that most responsible task in the world, the care of the sick. The 
country needs not more doctors but better ones. It is getting them. The medical 
course of study in a first-class medical college of to-day is calculated to try the earnest- 
ness as well as the ability of a would-be physician. 
Six more medical colleges have been closed this year; these were 
all institutions that had been rated in the lowest classification (class C) 
by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Associ- 
ciation. There have been 85 colleges closed by merger or otherwise 
since 1904, but during the same time 24 new colleges were organized, 
making a net reduction of 61 medical colleges. Of the colleges 
which closed, it is worthy of note (Table 3) that all but 3 of those 
rated in classes A and B were closed by merger. Of the 35 colleges 
which were closed outright, all but 3 were in class C, the lowest grade. 
1A pamphlet, containing the latest statement of classification will be sent on application to the Council 
on Medical Education.

1 Based on the classifications of medical colleges prepared by the Council on Medical Education. 
While the total number of colleges is growing smaller, however, 
and approaching more nearly the normal supply for this country, it 
is encouraging to note (see chart 1) that the number of high-grade, 
stronger medical colleges is constantly increasing. In 1904 only 
4 medical colleges were requiring any preliminary education in advance 
of the usual high-school education, and the vast majority were 
requiring much less than that; now 84 are requiring one or more 
years of advance college work and several others will enforce the 
higher requirement next year. Of these 84 colleges, 34 require two 
years or more of collegiate work for admission. Many of the colleges 
have been remarkably improved also in regard to buildings, new 
laboratories, better equipment, larger hospital facilities and—most 
important—more and better full-time salaried instructors. 
COLLEGES HAVING HIGHER ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
The 34 medical schools now requiring as a minimum for entrance 
two or more years of work in a college of liberal arts in addition to 
a four-year high-school education are here given, together with the 
year when the requirement went into effect: Requirement in force.

Five of the medical colleges reported in the above list as now 
requiring one year of collegiate work for admission have announced 
that all students admitted in the session of 1915-16 and thereafter 
will be required to have completed two years of collegiate work. 
They are: 
University of Alabama, School of Medicine. 
Ohio State University, College of Medicine. 
Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania. 
Medical College of Virginia. 
Marquette University, School of Medicine. 
That the low-standard colleges are the ones which are disappearing 
and that the colleges with more reasonably high standards are in- 
creasing is clearly indicated by chart 1 and the figures accompanying 
it. Chart 2 shows the increase of higher standard colleges by percent- 
ages. Whereas in 1904 less than 3 per cent of the medical colleges 
in the United States were requiring one or more years of collegiate 
work for admission, this year 83 per cent have adopted that standard, 
and 5 others have definitely announced the requirement to begin in 
1915. As shown by the heavier shading, the number of medical 
colleges requiring two or more years of collegiate work for admission 
has increased from 2.5 per cent in 1904 to 33.7 ner cent in 1914, and

several others have announced the requirement to begin in 1915. 
The adoption of higher requirements by medical colleges is leading 
to the adoption of similar requirements by State medical licensing 
boards. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS OF HIGHER PRELIMINARY EDUCATION. 
Twenty-five States have now adopted requirements of preliminary 
education in addition to a standard four-year high-school education. 
These States, the number of college years required, and the time the 
higher requirement becomes effective are given in Table 4.

It is worthy of comment that the adoption of higher standards of 
preliminary education by State licensing boards has invariably 
followed and not preceded the adoption of such requirements by 
the colleges in those States, showing that the action by the colleges 
was voluntary and not forced. This is perhaps the best guaranty 
that the higher standards will be enforced and that the change will be 
permanent. 
As shown in chart 3, the number of States adopting higher stand- 
ards has increased steadily since 1907. Now 25 States have adopted 
the requirement of one or more years of work beyond a four-year 
high-school education, including college courses in physics, chemistry, 
and biology, and 7 of these require two years of collegiate work, in- 
cluding the sciences named.

PROGRESS OF THE YEAR IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, 201 
FINANCIAL AID TO MEDICAL COLLEGES. 
Aside from the usual incomes for maintenance, incomplete returns 
show the gifts during the year for endowments, new buildings, 
research, and public-health instruction in medical schools amounted 
to over $9,000,000. Among these gifts were: One of $4,000,000 to 
Cornell University Medical College, by an anonymous donor; 
$1,500,000 from the General Education Board to the Johns Hopkins 
University Medical Department, to provide for the employment of 
all-time professors in three main clinical branches; a gift of $750,000 
for Washington University Medical School, St. Louis; and another 
of $500,000 to the Yale Medical School from the General Education 
Board to provide for all-time clinical professors. Because of litiga- 
tion the gift of $1,000,000 made by Mr. Carnegie to Vanderbilt 
University Medical Department about two years ago was not avail- ‘ 
able for use until this year. Numerous personal gifts were made to 
different medical schools, ranging from $5,000 to $250,000. For 
medical research at the Rockefeller Institute—not connected with 
any medical college—Mr. Rockefeller gave an additional $3,500,000 
to establish a department of animal pathology. Sums amounting to 
at least $4,010,750 were given during the year to build and maintain 
teaching hospitals. So far as reports were received, nearly $17,- 
000,000 in all was given during the past 12 or 14 months for medical 
education, teaching hospitals, and medical research. 
CLOSER RELATIONS WITH HOSPITALS. 
It has now come to be clearly recognized that among the best con- 
ducted hospitals in the country are those which are the teaching 
hospitals of high-grade medical schools. The atmosphere of study 
and research in the medical school seems also to permeate the hos-_ . 
pital. The attending physicians of the staff, who are also on the | 
faculty of the medical school, are more apt to be acquainted with 
the latest improved methods of diagnosis and treatment, and the 
patients naturally get the benefit of this knowledge. It is not sur- 
prising, therefore, that during the past year many hospitals have 
sought closer relationships with medical schools or have become 
teaching hospitals. Others have given medical schools wider privi- 
leges in their wards. During the year notable new buildings have 
been completed at St. Louis for the Barnes and St. Louis Children’s 
Hospitals, on grounds adjoining the new campus of the Washington 
University Medical School; at Boston, the large new buildings of the 
Peter Bent Brigham Hospital have been completed on property near 
the Medical School of Harvard University; at Cincinnati, some of 
the beautiful new buildings of the Cincinnati City Hospital have been 
completed—this being the teaching hospital of the Medical College

of the University of Cincinnati; at Indianapolis, the new Robert W. 
Long State Hospital has been completed, this being the teaching 
hospital of the Indiana University School of Medicine; at Nashville, 
Tenn., the new Galloway Memorial Hospital, the teaching hospital 
of the Vanderbilt University Medical Department, is rapidly ap- 
proaching completion; at Chicago, Wesley Hospital, the teaching 
hospital of the Northwestern University Medical School received 
$1,000,000 as an endowment fund for charity beds; at Cleveland, 
larger teaching privileges in the City Hospital have been granted to 
Western Reserve University Medical School; at San Francisco a new 
teaching hospital is to be erected for the University of California 
College of Medicine. 
DEVELOPMENT BY LIMITATION. 
Development by limitation is possible in medical education, even 
as a pruning of fruit trees leads to the production of better fruit. A 
year or two ago the Johns Hopkins University Medical Department 
adopted a rule limiting the enrollment of students in each class to 
90, believing that with its present laboratories and equipment the 
best instruction could not be given to larger numbers. This year 
Rush Medical College, affiliated with the University of Chicago, has 
announced that only 100 students each will be accepted in the first 
and second year classes and 120 each in the third and fourth year 
classes. 
In past years several medical colleges—notably the medical de- 
partments of the State Universities of Mississippi, Missouri, and 
North Carolina—voluntarily discontinued teaching the clinical years 
of the medical course, owing to the fact that the small cities in which 
they were located did not furnish an adequate amount of clinical 
material. During the last year another medical school, that of 
Dartmouth College, the fourth oldest medical college in the United 
States, with a record of granting degrees in medicine for 103 con- 
secutive years, has voluntarily discontinued teaching the clinical 
years, because sufficient clinical material was not available at Han- - 
over. The action in this last instance can not have been taken with- 
out a feeling of great regret and yet was promptly voted when the 
real conditions were understood. It is another example of the note- 
worthy decisions that, in the last several years, have marked the 
campaign for better-trained physicians in this country. Mean- 
while, this elimination at the Dartmouth Medical School opens the 
way for a marked development of the teaching of the first two years 
of the medical course.

PROGRESS OF THE YEAR IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, 203 
HELPS IN THE GENERAL PROGRESS. 
The rapid improvements thus far brought about in medical edu- 
cation are largely due to the voluntary action on the part of the 
better medical colleges following reports that have set forth the 
actual conditions existing in this country as compared with medical 
education in the other leading countries of the world. Mergers of 
two or more colleges in each of numerous cities were promptly made 
in order to form in each instance one stronger and better medical 
college. Higher entrance requirements were announced, campaigns 
for endowments were instigated, and the general upward movement 
began. There remained, however, a considerable number of medical 
colleges with more or less commercial aims from which voluntary 
development was hardly to be expected. Many of these were forced 
to elevate their standards or to close their doors through the action 
of the State medical licensing boards—the only bodies having the 
legal power to regulate medical colleges. Since the publication of 
the third classification of medical colleges t by the Council on Medical 
Education, it has been ascertained that, as a rule, the degrees granted 
by these low-grade medical colleges are not accepted as a qualification 
for license to practice in 31 States.? These States are as follows: 
TasiE 5.—State boards not recognizing low-grade colleges. 
      Alabama. Maryland. Pennsylvania. 
Arkansas. Michigan. Porto Rico. 
Colorado. Minnesota. Rhode Island. 
Connecticut. Mississippi. South Carolina. 
Delaware. New Hampshire. South Dakota. 
Florida. New Jersey. Texas. 
Georgia. New Mexico. Vermont. 
Indiana. New York. Virginia. 
Towa. North Dakota, West Vir 
Kentucky. Ohio. Wisconsin. 
Louisiana. Oklahoma. 
The action of State licensing boards, therefore, is having a very 
salutary effect in fixing and enforcing reasonably high standards 
of preliminary and medical education. As may be noted in chart 
3, page 200, however, many of the colleges had themselves volun- 
tarily anticipated the higher standards and made radical improve- 
ments. 
Meanwhile, unless the remaining 18 States secure the necessary 
laws giving their licensing boards power to refuse recognition to 
low-grade colleges, or unless the licensing boards make use of such

powers as are conferred on them, those States will be in danger of 
becoming the dumping ground for the product of these low-standard 
colleges. 
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS BY LICENSING BOARDs. 
Since a year ago 4 more licensing boards have been empowered 
to establish standards of preliminary education. Three more States— 
Arkansas, Georgia, and Louisiana—have fixed the preliminary 
requirement at a four-year high-school education; 12 more boards 
have adopted (see Table 4) the requirement of one or two years of 
collegiate work in addition to a four-year high-school education; 4 
more State boards and that of Porto Rico (see Table 5) have adopted 
a rule refusing to recognize low-standard medical colleges; and 1 
more State, Georgia, has secured a practice act establishing a single 
medical examiner, to replace three independent and conflicting 
boards. 
The progress of the last year and of the last 10 years is shown in 
Table 6.

There are still 5 States in which the medical-practice acts make no 
provision for standards of preliminary education, these being the 
District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Tennessee. 
The 9 States in which no standard has been fixed or in which the 
requirement of preliminary education is evidently less than a four- 
year high-school education are: 
District of Columbia. Massachusetts. Oregon. 
Florida. Montana. South Carolina. 
Idaho. Oklahoma. Tennessee.
-P-A-G-E-243
  PROGRESS OF THE YEAR IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, 205 
The 4 States which still allow nongraduates in medicine—those 
whose training is thus known to be incomplete—to take the examina- 
tion for license, are Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Tennessee. 
Because of the severity of the examination such candidates are 
seldom able to secure licenses in Colorado and Oregon, and only a 
few succeed in getting over the minimum percentage required in 
Massachusetts. In Tennessee, on the contrary, statistics show that, 
of the 1,187 candidates licensed by examination in the last four years, 
515, or 43.4 per cent, were nongraduates. A strong effort is to be 
made to secure a new practice act in Tennessee, however. 
The 12 States in which the licensing boards do not appear to have 
full authority to withdraw recognition from low-grade medical col- 
leges are: 
Arizona. Idaho. Montana. 
Arkansas.! Louisiana.? Oregon. 
District of Columbia. Maryland. Tennessee. 
Florida. Massachusetts. Wyoming. 
In the following States the laws apparently give the boards author- 
ity to refuse recognition to low-grade colleges, but, so far as has been 
reported, the boards are as yet making little use of that authority: 
California. Missouri.? Utah. 
Illinois. Nebraska. Washington. 
Kansas. Nevada. 
Maine. North Carolina. 
There are yet 9 States in which the licensing boards have not estab- 
lished the so-called “reciprocal relations” with other States, by which 
the license issued to a physician by one State is recognized without 
further examination by the other, in case the physician desires for 
good reasons to move to the latter State. These States are: 
Alabama. Florida. Oregon. 
Arizona. Massachusetts. Rhode Island. 
Connecticut. Montana. Washington. 
Under the present control of licensure, a physician who is licensed 
in one State and who for good reasons desires to move to another 
State has to submit to a second tedious examination, including often- 
times very impractical questions.’ To offset this difficulty reciprocal 
relations have, in recent years, been established between States of 
supposedly equal standards, whereby one board will accept the ex- 
amination of the other as equal to its own, on condition that the other 
board will reciprocate. Such relations have been established by the 
majority of States, but in many instances with only 1 to 10 other   
1 Authority divided between two or three separate and independent boards. 
2 One medical college has been reported as “not in good standing.” 
3 One instance is reported of an eminent physician of national reputation who, when moving to another 
State, was required to undergo a written test of his ability to remember textbook words—the test being given, 
it was inferred, by one of his former pupils.  
-P-A-G-E-244
  206 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
States. Some boards have the legal power to establish such relation- 
ships, but arbitrarily refrain from doing so, thereby placing an undue 
hardship on physicians who desire to remove to or from those States. 
Based on the instances in which reciprocal relations have been estab- 
lished, the physician’s chance of becoming re-registered without 
further examination is about one in three. In actual practice, how- 
ever, his chances are much less than that, owing to the other condi- 
tions which State boards are compelled to fix because of the wide 
variance of standards. 
Such conditions by State boards are very essential, however, since 
a poorly administered rule regarding reciprocal registration would 
seriously lower educational standards. Universal reciprocity will be 
impossible so long as such widely varying standards of medical 
licensure are maintained. Meanwhile, thousands of physicians are 
annually subjected to an unnecessary hardship. It has therefore 
been suggested ! that an examination given under Federal authority, 
without infringing in the least on the examination given by the 
various States, would in time come to be cheerfully accepted by the 
States as sound proof of the qualification of the physician who passed 
it. The nearest approach to such an examination at present is that 
required of medical officers in the United States Army, Navy, and 
Public Health Service. Such an examination might be thrown open 
to any physician on payment of a reasonable fee, whether he is to serve 
as a Government official or not. Eventually, no doubt, all the States 
would recognize this Government examination. In five States at the 
present time those who have served as officers in the Government 
medical service are eligible to receive licenses without further exami- 
nation. These States are Alabama, California, Colorado, Illinois, and 
North Dakota. 
There still remain 8 States in which there are two or three boards, 
instead of one, concerned with the licensing of physicians. These 
States, and the number of boards in each, are: 
Arkansas, 3. District of Columbia, 3. Maryland, 2. 
Connecticut, 3. Florida, 2. New Hampshire, 3. 
Delaware, 2. Louisiana, 2. 
The authority of the two boards in Delaware is centralized ina 
medical council; that of the three boards of the District of Columbia 
is centralized in a board of medical supervisors; and that of the three 
boards of New Hampshire, in the regent—the State superintendent of 
public instruction. In the other 5 States, however, the entire 
machinery for examining and licensing physicians is duplicated or 
triplicated and placed in the hands of two or three separate and inde- 
pendent boards. This confusion has repeatedly resulted in a prac-

terly of the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States, April, 1914, p. 235.
-P-A-G-E-245
PROGRESS OF THE YEAR IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, 207 
tical annulment of educational standards. It has repeatedly hap- 
pened that candidates who could not secure licenses from one board 
have readily passed the “examination” of another. 
STANDARDS OF MEDICAL PRACTICE. 
The question of the standards of medical practice is educational. 
In effect the State asks: Has the practitioner had the training by 
which he is enabled to recognize the disease he is called upon to cure? 
If not, his treatment is mere guesswork and is as apt to do harm as 
good. Successful treatment of any disorder depends largely upon an 
accurate knowledge of what is causing that disorder. In all leading 
countries it is recognized that tosecure an adequate training in diagnosis 
and treatment of diseases requires hard study for five or six years 
beyond the high-school education—this training to be secured in 
well-equipped laboratories, in dispensaries, and in hospitals. Such 
is the training now required by the majority of the medical colleges in 
the United States. 
Dr. F. M. Crandall, of New York, states the case as follows: 
The medical laws are but a part of the general educational laws of the State. These 
laws are wide in their application, and cover many professions and diverse conditions. 
There is nothing exceptional in the laws covering medical practice. They are at the 
farthest possible remove from class legislation. They are simply a part of the great 
educational system of the State. The medical profession has upheld the hands of the 
State educational authorities, whose aim has been to enact a broad and consistent 
system of just and equitable laws. A State educational system has, therefore, been 
built up, of which the laws controlling medical practice are an integral part. * * * 
The medical profession approves the system which requires the same general pro- 
fessional education of all its members. The specialist upon the eye and the specialist 
upon the throat, the physician and the surgeon, must each undergo the same training 
and must pass the same State examination. One may select any specialty he chooses 
and may adopt any method of treatment which his educated judgment dictates. He 
may use large doses or small, massage or electricity. What the State requires for one 
body of practitioners it should not abate in favor of another. 
We may properly demand that every man and woman who enters upon the practice 
of the healing art should have adequate education. Here we are on ground that can 
not be misjudged or misrepresented. We ask no favors or special privileges. We are 
not the ones who are seeking to bring half-educated practitioners in by the back door. 
We simply ask equal requirements for all. 
RELATION OF MEDICINE TO GENERAL EDUCATION. 
Medical education is necessarily closely related to, or in a sense a 
part of, the system of general education. Heretofore, in the adminis- 
tration of entrance requirements the deans of medical colleges had 
most to do with high schools, which fortunately have been fairly 
well standardized. Now that medical colleges have advanced their 
entrance requirements to include one or more years of collegiate 
work, there comes the question: What is ‘‘collegiate” work? It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
      208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
  a well-known fact that there are colleges so called which in reality 
are teaching little else than secondary school courses. In an effort 
to prevent the higher requirements adopted by medical colleges from 
interfering with the proper development of high schools, the Council 
on Medical Education, in its ‘‘Outline of the Essentials of an Accept- 
able Medical College,’’ has inserted a clause that ‘‘college work should 
not be considered as such unless it has been preceded by a completed 
course of study in a standard four-year secondary school or its full 
educational equivalent.’”’ It is believed that observance of this rule 
will aid materially in the administration of the requirement of ‘‘col- 
lege work.” It will at once eliminate the short-cut secondary school 
colleges which endeavor to crowd the work of several years into three 
or four and, it is hoped, wil! help in the work of standardizing our 
colleges of liberal arts. The Council on Medical Education is now 
preparing for its own guidance a list of liberal arts colleges in which 
courses considered as essential prerequisites to the study of medicine 
are properly taught. No liberal-arts college will be included in the 
list which does not require for admission the completion of a standard 
four-year high-school course or its full educational equivalent. 
ENTRANCE TO COLLEGE BY EXAMINATION. 
The weakest point in the administration of satisfactory entrance 
requirements to medical and to other colleges is in the so-called 
“equivalent-examination” method. The examination is needed to 
test the knowledge of the occasional student whose courses in the 
secondary school are not regularly taken, but who may have covered 
as much ground as the graduates. This method of admitting stu- 
dents, however, has been taken advantage of by some ‘‘colleges” 
and an ‘‘easy” examination has been provided in order to admit 
large numbers of students who otherwise could not qualify. 
THOROUGH AND RELIABLE EXAMINATIONS ESSENTIAL. 
The chief evil of the examination method lies in the multiplicity 
of agencies having to do with such examinations, where there could 
well be only one in each State. To ascertain the actual value of any 
  
1 The fraudulent methods by which an institution provided credentials for students seeking admission 
to a medical college in Chicago were discovered to be as follows: A set of questions with the answers filled 
in were furnished each “student,” wHo was told to take them home, memorize the answers, and return in 
two weeks to take the ‘‘examination,” where, of course, the same questions would be asked. In one 
instance, at least, when the time for the “examination” came around, the farce became even more ridicu- 
lous. The examiner deputized the preparatory school officer to conduct the examination; this he pro- 
ceeded to do in the easiest manner for himself and for the students. Examination paper was given out and 
the students were instructed to take it home, write out the answers that had already been furnished them, 
and return the written papers the next day. Thus they did not even need to memorize the answers to the 
questions asked. Following this farce, nevertheless, these “students” were furnished with affidavits 
signed in the presence of a notary public, by a county superintendent of schools of an adjoining State, 
setting forth that these ‘“‘students” had ‘passed’? examinations in the required branches of the high- 
school curriculum.—Jour. Amer. Med. Assn., Feb. 7, 1914, p. 47.    
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  
PROGRESS OF THE YEAR IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, 209 
examination there is a fairly reliable and simple test, which should 
be applied: Require documentary evidence as to when and in what 
school or schools the preliminary preparation was obtained. It is 
practically impossible for a student to pass an examination which 
actually proves that he has the equivalent of a standard high-school 
course, unless he can show evidence of four years or more of attend- 
ance in secondary schools, private tutoring, or of other legitimate 
means of preparation. For example, no student could pass a fair 
examination in algebra unless he has actually studied algebra. So 
when a student is found to have attended high school only one or two 
years and yet easily passes an ‘‘examination” in all the subjects of a 
complete four-year high-school course, then it can be seen at once 
that something is wrong either with the examination or the examiner. 
A routine method of verification of every credential presented by the 
student, whether it be a diploma or a certificate of examination, 
should be adopted by every well-regulated college. 
In the enforcement of the four-year high-school standard, there- 
fore, the medical colleges have been urged to secure for each student 
direct from the principal of the secondary school attended, a state- 
ment showing the courses taken by the student, the number of weeks 
covered in each course, the number of periods per week, the length of 
the period in minutes, and the final grade obtained. This simple 
routine procedure secures official and reliable evidence of the work 
done by the student, and without it no accurate idea can be obtained 
regarding his work. 
ADMINISTRATION OF ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
One of the best evidences that improved standards of preliminary 
education for entrance to medical colleges are becoming effective is 
that already fears are being expressed in some quarters that the 
standards may become so exacting as to hinder some well-qualified 
students from gaining admission. Most of the ‘fears,’ however, 
have emanated from medical colleges which are conducted more as 
business enterprises than as educational institutions—colleges whose 
methods of admitting students have so far exceeded the utmost 
bounds of ‘liberality’ as to render void any entrance standard. 
The motives back of complaints from such sources are so apparent 
as to make the complaints unworthy of notice. In several instances, 
however, misgivings have been expressed from the most sincere 
motives, lest the entrance requirements to medical schools be made 
so rigid as to work a hardship in individual cases. Such statements 
have made it clear, however, that the speakers were in entire sym- 
pathy with the higher standards. Such statements are opportune as 
a warning rather than an indication that the rigidity feared is already 
being experienced. In fact, the requirements suggested by the

  210 EDUCATION: REPORT, 1914. 
Council on Medical Education and other standardizing agencies are 
not inflexible, and the care of the exceptional cases is purely a matter 
of common-sense administration. The standard meanwhile is. (a) 
completion of a standard four-year high-school education or its 
actual educational equivalent and, in addition, (6) one or more 
years of collegiate work equal to that taken in standard colleges of 
liberal arts, this collegiate work to include courses in physics, chemis- 
try, and biology. The student is strongly urged also to secure a 
reading knowledge of French or German. A common-sense, con- 
scientious enforcement of that standard is all that is asked. Legal 
bodies—the State licensing boards, for example—must fix and with- 
out discrimination adhere to a minimum requirement, and of course 
the closer an institution hugs to the minimum line the less room will 
there be for flexibility. 
CHOICE OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL. 
The choice of a medical school by the prospective medical student 
has perhaps never been so easy in this country as at the present time, 
since never before has there been so much reliable information avail- 
able for his guidance. And there has never been a time when a 
careful and wise choice was so important; never have there been so 
many pitfalls or misleading paths for the unwary. 
MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE MORE EXTENSIVE AND COMPLETE. 
Up to a decade or two ago the training secured in any medical col- 
lege was deemed sufficient to give-the physician a start in his life 
work. That was before the days of the microscope in the practice 
of medicine and before the discovery of the microbic origin of many 
diseases. Then two years of teaching by such odd moments as busy 
doctors could spare from their practice was not looked upon as 
inadequate. At the present time, however, medicine is based on 
scientific knowledge, and without this knowledge the physicians of 
the future will be a failure. To get this knowledge the student needs 
a better preliminary education than formerly and must secure his 
medical education in a college which gives a four or five year course, 
which has a corps of expert, salaried teachers, expensively equipped 
laboratories, and an abundance of clinical material in dispensaries 
and hospitals. 
STATE REQUIREMENTS MORE EXACTING. 
Only a decade or two ago anyone was at liberty to begin medical 
practice in almost all States, there being no provision by law for 
standards of education or proficiency. Even in the few States in 
which registration was required almost any evidence of medical
-P-A-G-E-249
  
PROGRESS OF THE YEAR IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, 211 
training was sufficient to secure the license. During the last 15 or 
20 years, however, the States have found it necessary to secure 
medical-practice acts in an effort to guarantee to the public that only 
those having a satisfactory training in medicine should be permitted 
to assume the responsibility for the care of the sick. Registration is 
now required in all States, and in most States certain definite qualifi- 
cations are demanded before the physician can secure a license to 
practice. In most States the licensing boards are empowered to fix 
standards of preliminary and medical education.. As shown in 
Table 4, on page 199, 25 States now require one or two years of col- 
legiate work as the minimum standard of preliminary education and 
refuse to recognize medical colleges which do not come up to certain 
defined requirements regarding teachers, laboratories, and hospital 
equipment. In about 30 States, colleges which conform to such 
requirements are listed as “reputable” or “in good standing,” and 
only graduates of such colleges are eligible to take the board’s exami- 
nation for license. All others are referred to as “not recognized,” 
“not reputable,” or ‘‘not in good standing.” 
NONRECOGNITION OF MEDICAL COLLEGES. 
While in 1904 only 2 or 3 States were in any way refusing to recog- 
nize low-grade medical colleges, now diplomas issued by such colleges 
are not recognized in at least 30 States. This action by State licensing 
boards is the only legal power by which inferior médical colleges may 
be forced to make the needed improvements or to close their doors. 
Of the 107 medical colleges which were in session during the past 
year, 21 are not recognized in from 24 to 32 States. Because of the 
requirement of two years of collegiate work as the minimum standard 
of preliminary education in 7 States, graduates of only 32 colleges 
may invariably count on being eligible to register in these 7 States. 
In 6 of these States graduates of 65 colleges are eligible for registra- 
tion if the student has completed two or more years of work in an ap- 
proved liberal-arts college prior to entering the medical school. Before 
choosing a medical college, therefore, a student should be sure he 
has the required preliminary education and that the college of his 
choice is recognized in all States. 
The question is, How may the student secure the information needed 
on these matters? Some medical colleges advertise extensively in 
the newspapers and in popular magazines, and send out announce- 
ments and circulars containing very glowing, if not misleading state- 
ments. It is essential, therefore, that before chocsing a medical 
school, the prospective student should secure further information 
from impartial and reliable sources, so that he may be sure he is not

  212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
enticed into a poorly equipped institution to find on graduation that 
his diploma is not recognized in a large number of States. 
An important matter which the student is always bound to con- 
sider is the expense. But it is well for him to know that to enter a 
low-grade medical college because the fees may be a little lower is 
poor economy. The truth is that in the same length of time, and 
often for even lower fees than he would pay in the poorly equipped 
institutions, he may acquire his education in some one of the best- 
equipped medical schools in the land. This refers particularly to 
the medical departments of State universities. On the other hand, 
the student should know that even if some of the better schools do 
charge higher, fees, nevertheless, they spend on each student per 
year several times the amount of money that the student pays in 
tuition. Here, again, it would be poor economy to enter a low- 
standard college which depends on students’ fees alone for its income, 
when for a few additional dollars each year he can enter a thoroughly 
equipped institution and get a far better medical training. Even 
should he be required to work his way through college in whole or 
in part, the opportunities for doing so are, as a rule, greater in the 
better than in the lower standard colleges. Generally, however, 
worthy students who are poor in purse are the very ones who appre- 
ciate not only the value of money, but also the value of the medical 
course they are getting. Such students are seldom beguiled into a 
poor college by alluring and misleading advertisements. On the 
other hand, many such students are found to be working all or part 
of their way through some of the highest grade institutions. 
In order that the student may be thoroughly informed in any and 
all of the foregoing matters it would be well for him not only to secure 
the announcements of a number of colleges among which he may be 
able to choose, but also to secure reliable information from other 
sources. He should read the reports on medical education by the 
various standardizing agencies referred to in this article. At the 
present time, in order to be eligible to practice medicine in all States, 
the student must have completed two or more years of work in a 
standard liberal-arts college. He should then obtain his training 
in a medical school of unquestioned standing. 
The student must bear in mind that in his preliminary and med- 
ical training he is laying the foundation for the rest of his life. If a 
year or two more is needed to enter one of the better medical colleges, 
he may count it as time well spent, since he is all the more sure of 
having laid a solid foundation. The medical profession in this 
country is extremely overcrowded, but there is always room for 
physicians who are thoroughly competent.

ALL-TIME CLINICAL PROFESSORS. 
Those who have noted the marked development of laboratory 
instruction in medicine, following the employment by the colleges 
of expert, all-time professors in those branches, can readily appre- 
ciate the developments which would follow the securing of all-time 
professors in the clinical branches. It is now clearly recognized that 
those who are the best teachers in medical colleges are those whose 
life work, whose chief interest, is the welfare of the medical students. 
Medical teaching of the highest type is simply impossible when the 
teacher is dependent on his active practice for a livelihood and can 
give only fragments of his time to teaching. 
That teachers of the laboratory branches should give ‘their entire 
time to teaching and to a certain amount of research in the medical 
school is no longer disputed. That there needs to be a general 
reorganization of clinical teaching is also clearly understood. That 
clinical teachers should entirely refrain from the practice of their 
profession, however, is certainly not desirable. The experience 
gained from a general contact with patients in their homes and 
under varying conditions is one of the important qualifications of a 
good clinical teacher. It prevents him from falling into the unsym- 
pathetic, machine-like routine methods of the hospital. On the con- 
trary, his practice keeps alive within him the bond of sympathy 
and consideration for the patient, a matter which every medical 
student should be taught to keep in mind. It is a qualification, 
meanwhile, which counts much in the development of a successful 
practice. 
It is quite evident, therefore, that the need is for some method 
whereby the clinical professor’s practice will be so limited as to pre- 
vent it from interfering with his duties as a teacher. For several 
years a number of medical colleges—notably those of Leland Stan- 
ford, Yale, Washington University (at St. Louis), and the Universities 
of California and Pennsylvania—have limited the practice of some 
of their clinical teachers to consultations in the hospital. The results 
have been excellent. 
During the past year another plan has been suggested by the 
General Education Board, which has donated $1,500,000 to the 
Johns Hopkins University Medical Department to provide for placing 
the chairs of medicine, pediatrics, and surgery on a salaried basis, 
The holders of these chairs are to be paid definite salaries and will 
be free to practice as they may desire, but any fees collected are to go 
into the university treasury. Gifts of $750,000 and $500,000 for a 
like purpose have been given to Washington University Medical 
School at St. Louis and to Yale Medical School. This plan appar- 
ently has never been tried either in this country or abroad and pre-

sents some difficulties. There is a question as to the rank of a man 
| who can be secured to give full time to college work and receive no 
compensation outside of a salary that is small compared with the 
incomes of leading practicing physicians. 
} The plan proposed by the General Education Board is commented 
on in an editorial in one of the leading medical journals,' extracts of 
which are as follows: 
That the teaching of the clinical branches must be put more nearly on the basis of 
the teaching of the fundamental subjects, and that full-time teachers must be as- 
signed to these subjects, is becoming more or less generally recognized. Itis believed, 
however, that a large number of men engaged in practice will also be needed to give 
part of their time to teaching and research, though the number will probably not be so 
large as at present. When, however, the question is raised as to the rank of the man 
who can be secured to give full time to the college work and receive no compensation, 
outside of the salary, there is considerable difference of opinion. Ifa man of excep- 
tional ability has worked his way to the head ofa department, does he disqualify him- 
self for the position if he declines to give up the emoluments of general practice? 
Will not the attempt to restrict great clinical teachers to a salary result in the medi- 
cal schools being compelled to accept men of less commanding ability and power? 
If a great clinician is willing to give half or two-thirds of his time to research and in- 
struction, but wishes to reserve two or three hours a day for consulting work for which 
he can readily secure large fees, is there any real advantage gained in compelling him 
to surrender these fees to the university? 
An important economic problem is involved here which can not at this time be dis- 
cussed at length. It is important to say, however, that by placing the clinical chairs 
on a salaried basis it may become as diflicult for the medical colleges to secure and 
retain the services of the best talent in the clinical departments as it is for our schools 
of technology and engineering to keep on their faculties the most skilled engineers, 
who are drawn away from teaching by the large emoluments offered by the commercial 
world, If the public service is of great value, are not the greater emoluments justi- 
fiable? Is it not the very experience these men gain in their public service which 
makes them so desirable on the faculties of the teaching institutions? It is an impor- 
tant question, therefore, whether it is best either for the public or for the college to 
restrict the work of these men. - 
A different plan, proposed by one of our leading educators, would place the prin- 
cipal burden of teaching in the clinical branches on the younger men, who would 
devote themselves for 10 or 15 years to teaching and research exclusively, at a modest 
but adequate and gradually increasing salary. The sum which it is proposed to pay 
to the clinical heads under the plan just discussed would support four or five men of 
this type. At the end of 10, 12, or 15 years some of these men by reason of their 
exceptional opportunities would have gained the knowledge and experience which 
would prove their exceptional ability as teachers. The college would thereby be 
enabled to make the wisest choice of those to be granted professorships or to be placed 
at the head of the various clinical departments. For these younger men there would 
be a constant inducement to strive for the higher positions open to them. And 
whether they reached the desired goal or not, they would be prepared by a broader 
knowledge and experience to render a larger service to humanity as strong consulting 
practitioners, so that, as a rule, they could demand at once large fees, and in this way 
secure adequate reward for their years of service to education. They would still 
retain their connection with the medical schools, however, giving a large amount of 
their time to research and teaching, for a small compensation.

PROGRESS OF THE YEAR IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, 215 
There are some who feel that the latter plan possesses many advantages: It securse 
the undivided time and energy of men for teaching and research in the most productive 
period of their lives, and it effects an ideal pension system, or rather makes unnecessary 
any pension system. It closely approximates the actual practice in the clinical depart- 
ments of the German, universities, where, as a rule, one contentedly serves an appren- 
ticeship for many years at a meager salary because of the hope of a large reward in 
honor and financial return on attainment of a professorship, which rarely comes to a 
man in Germany under 45 or 50. A large part of the best research work, and by far 
the greater part of the teaching in the German medical schools, has always been done 
by the younger men of this type. 
In the annual report of the Council on Medical Education to the 
house of delegates of the American Medical Association,’ among other 
comments on this subject the following statements are made: 
In clinical work the head of the department and his associates must be three things— 
first, great physicians in their special field; second, trained teachers; and third, re- 
search workers. The medical school very properly demands that their clinical 
teachers be men who are recognized as authorities in their special fields, both by the 
profession and by the community. In the organization of a clinical department this 
fact must not be lost sight of, and whatever plan is adopted must make it possible for 
the clinical teachers to remain the great authorities in their special fields both in the 
eyes of the profession and of the public. 
The plan adopted by the German universities has been on the whole most satis- 
factory. There, a professor in a clinical department is in every sense a university 
professor, just as much as the professor of chemistry or of physics. His university 
work commands his time. He must allow nothing to interfere with his teaching, his 
clinical work in the hospital, or his research, and he devotes on the average quite as 
much time to his university work as does his colleague in chemistry or in mathematics, 
In addition to this, however, he devotes some time each day to private practice by 
which he maintains his position before the profession and the public asa great 
specialist. This can be done without neglecting his university position. In fact, if 
he does not remain.the great physician, he ceases to be of as much value either to his 
students or to his university. On the other hand, if he should neglect his university 
work because of the time he devoted to private practice, his services should be dis- 
pensed with. 
A special committee composed of prominent clinical teachers is 
preparing a report on this important problem, which will doubtless 
be published during the next year. It will be awaited with interest. 
GRADUATE COURSES IN PUBLIC HEALTH. 
Graduate courses in public health have been established in con- 
nection with ten medical schools leading to a degree of doctor of 
public health? (Dr. P. H.), certified sanitarian (C.S.), master of 
science in public health (M. S. (P. H.)), or master of public health 
(M. P. H.). The course is for one year except at the Universities of 
Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, where the course for 
the doctorate covers two years. Wisconsin gives a diploma in public 
health (D. P. H.) for a one-year course. The University of Cali-

HOSPITAL INTERNESHIPS FOR RECENT MEDICAL GRADUATES. 
The report of last year pointed out the importance of at least a 
year’s experience in a hospital as an interne for every medical grad- 
uate before he enters practice. An investigation of hospitals has 
been started in order to prepare a list of those which are properly 
equipped and in position to furnish a satisfactory training. It is 
quite apparent that there is an ample number of hospitals which are 
so equipped, and of those which can easily become so, to provide 
acceptable interneships for every medical graduate. Already about 
75 or 80 per cent of graduates voluntarily secure these positions, 
and now five medical colleges have adopted a requirement that the 
student must have taken such interneships before they are granted 
the degree of doctor of medicine. These colleges, and the session 
when the requirement became or will become effective, are as follows:

One State licensing board, that of Pennsylvania, now requires that

that State, must have served at least one year as an interne in an 
approved hospital. The requirement became effective in 1914.

  PROGRESS OF THE YEAR IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, Q17 
GRADUATE MEDICAL INSTRUCTION. 
During the year a beginning has been made toward an investiga- 
tion of graduate medical instruction in this country by a special 
committee appointed by the Council on Medical Education. The 
preliminary report of this committee * outlines the chief essentials to be 
considered. Says the report: 
Rather than postgraduate education, it would better be described as graduate edu- 
cation, which is the term customarily used by universities. The objecis o! 
medical instruction are: 
1. To offer advanced instruction and opportunities for research. 
2. To prepare physicians for special fields of work. 
8. To offer opportunities for review, and for keeping in touch with.the advances in 
medical science since the physician graduated. 
4, To make up the deficiencies in previous medical education. 
  ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS. 
It is evident from the discussion of the scope of graduate medical instruction that 
there can be no uniform admission requirements of an educational nature, such as may 
be reasonably imposed on undergraduate medical schools. Adequate preparation of 
an individual to take any given course should, however, be insisted on. Asa matter 
of benefit to the public, any earnest, reputable practitioner, licensed by the proper 
authorities to practice medicine on the public, should be allowed to take such courses 
as he is qualified for by previous training and experience. 
The recent and rapid improvement in undergraduate medical schools will result in 
turning into the profession hereafter better trained physicians. Something, however, 
needs to be done for the multitudes of doctors who are already in practice, many of 
whom graduated from medical schools which could not give them the desired training. 
In the interests of the communities where these doctors practice, nothing is more 
important than that graduate courses in medicine should be developed in this country, 
so that these doctors can take additional work, to the benefit both of themselves and 
of their patients. Some of these doctors have realized their needs sufficiently to 
sacrifice the time and money required to take graduate work abroad. How much 
more important it is that those who do not at present realize their needs, or those who 
can not afford these foreign trips, be given the opportunity nearer home to secure 
additional training. 
CERTIFICATES. 
It is generally recognized that the loose regulations about granting certificates for 
postgraduate work often result in a definite evil. Such a certificate usually has a 
form similar to a diploma. It is suitable for display and is calculated to impress the 
public. Ordinary people are apt to regard such a certificate, displayed in a doctor’s 
office, in much the same light as a degree, and they look on its possessor as a full fledged 
specialist in any subject mentioned on the certificate. Advantage is taken of this fact 
by unscrupulous physicians who pose as specialists without any real justification in the 
knowledge or experience they have gained. Such practice is little short of quackery. 
The graduate school should under no circumstances be conducted or considered as a 
“credential mill.” 
PROPRIETARY SCHOOLS. 
While graduate medical instruction has been taken up by many of the regular 
medical schools, there have arisen a number of proprietary postgraduate schools. 
1 Amer. Med. Assoc, Bulletin, May 15, 1914, p. 313.  
-P-A-G-E-256
  218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Some of these are doing excellent work and have satisfactory ideals, but many are 
little better than commercial enterprises for the direct or indirect financial benefit of 
those in control. The situation in regard to proprietary graduate schools is the same as 
existed formerly among regular medical schools. Possibly conditions are worse. 
There are the same objections to proprietary graduate medical schools as to proprietary 
undergraduate schools. It is to be hoped that those which are really doing good work 
will see the advantage of association with a medical school or university of good stand- 
ing. The standards of instruction and the ideals of the graduate school should be fully 
as high as those of the undergraduate medical school. Public opinion will frown on 
commercialism in graduate medical instruction just as much as it does on commer- 
cialism in undergraduate teaching. 
In the light of the above statements it is encouraging to know that 
within the last few years five universities have established graduate 
schools of medicine. These graduate schools and their location are 
as follows: Location. 
University of Alabama Graduate School of Medicine...................Birmingham. 
University of California Graduate School of Medicine. . .-Los Angeles. 
Tulane University Postgraduate School of Medicine. -New Orleans. 
Harvard University Graduate School of Medicine. - Boston. 
University of Minnesota Graduate School of Medicine. . - Minneapolis. 
     
   
The opening of such schools by high-grade universities is very 
encouraging and gives assurance that graduate medical instruction 
on a high plane is rapidly becoming more available in this country. 
IN CONCLUSION. 
The remarkable progress of tho last several years is an assurance 
of a continued progress in future. As the reading public becomes 
more generally informed regarding the conditions and needs of 
medical education and the practice of the healing art, the laws goy- 
erning these matters will inevitably improve and the public interests 
be better safeguarded. It is surely a matter of vital interest to every 
citizen of this great country that those who are to assume the most 
responsible of tasks—the care of the sick—shall have obtained a 
thorough training in modern medicine. Furthermore, the citizens 
of this country have a right to expect that such laws will be passed 
as will prevent the uneducated and unqualified from imposing on the 
public.

MEDICAL EDUCATION IN THE HOMEOPATHIC SCHOOL 
OF MEDICINE.

Secretary of the Council on Medical Education of the American Institute of Homeopathy. 
ConTENTS.—Establishment and organization of homeopathic institutions—Hospital inspection and _ 
grading—Homeopathic medical research—List of schools. 
ESTABLISHMENT AND ORGANIZATION OF HOMEOPATHIC INSTITUTIONS. 
Homeopathy, the system of medicine founded by Samuel Hahne- 
mann, a German physician, has had special influence in the United 
States, where the system was introduced nearly 100 years ago. The 
early disciples of homeopathy were practitioners educated in general 
medicine; scholars who recognized the importance of education and 
research in the upbuilding of any system of medicine, especially one 
which sought to invade the existing medical field and disturb ancient 
traditions. Accordingly, early attention was given to the training 
of practitioners. The first homeopathic teaching institution in the 
United States, the North American Academy of the Healing Art, 
was established at Allentown, Pa., in 1835. The American Institute 
of Homeopathy, the oldest national medical society in the United 
States, was established in 1844 for the purpose of encouraging and 
preserving the contributions made to the materia medica of the 
homeopathic school of medicine, and one of the requisites for member- 
ship was that the candidate be qualified in medicine, especially in 
homeopathy. Thus, there was established early in the history of 
the school two departments, medical education and research inves- 
tigation. 
As the system of homeopathy grew, the number of institutions 
increased with considerable rapidity, and at one time there were 
between 20 and 25 in existence throughout the country. The distri- 
bution of these was not always along the line of wisdom; for instance, 
there were at one time in the city of Chicago six medical colleges 
teaching the homeopathic system of medicine. 
All the teaching institutions of the school were under the direct 
supervision of the national organization through what was termed 
the intercollegiate committee, which provided and controlled en- 
trance, curriculum, and graduation requirements. The entrance of 
219

  220 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
State legislation into the field of medicine, especially medical edu- 
cation, required the solving of new problems, and there was estab- 
lished in the-place of the’ intercollegiate committee a permanent 
medical committee entitled “the council on medical education of the 
American Institute of Homeopathy.’’ The council on medical edu- 
cation is at present composed of Dr. George Royal, Des Moines, 
Iowa, professor of materia medica and therapeutics of the Homeo- 
pathic Medical College of Iowa State University, chairman; Dr. 
Willis A. Dewey, Ann Arbor, Mich., professor of materia medica and 
therapeutics of the Homeopathic Medical College of the University 
of Michigan, secretary; Dr. John P. Sutherland, Boston, Mass., 
professor of theory and practice of medicine, Boston University 
School of Medicine; Dr. John B. Garrison, New York, laryngologist 
to the Laura Franklin Free Hospital for Children; Dr. H. H. Baxter, 
Cleveland, Ohio, former member of the Ohio State Board of Medical 
Examiners; and Dr. C. E. Sawyer, of Marion, Ohio, special ex officio 
member. 
The council on medical education last year issued a report on the 
colleges of the homeopathic school, which was heartily welcomed 
and accepted by State board members as being the authoritative 
expression of the fitness of the institutions of the homeopathic medi- 
cal school. Since the issuance of this report there has been much 
improvement in the teaching efficiency of all the colleges. The 
Ohio college, formerly located at Cleveland, has been removed to. 
Columbus, where it becomes a department of the Ohio State Uni- 
versity, under the control of the trustees of that institution. It 
has entered upon the year’s work with a new faculty, new buildings, 
hospital facilities, and an encouraging class of students. The Kan- 
sas City institution is being placed upon a permanent basis. Other 
homeopathic colleges have been improved by new buildings, facili- 
ties, teaching staffs, equipment, or endowment. At a conservative 
estimate, during the year 1913-14 not less than $1,000,000 has been 
expended in the improvement of the several homeopathic teaching 
institutions. 
There are at the present time 10 medical colleges devoted to the 
teaching of homeopathic medicine, distributed from Boston to San 
Francisco. The entrance requirements, curricula, and _ general 
management are supervised by the council on medical education, 
subject to the laws of the various States wherein the colleges are 
located. A homeopathic college claims the honor of having been the 
first to establish a compulsory three years’ course, and the first to 
require four years as the minimum college term.‘ In several a pre- 
medical year has been established, in which students are required   
1 Boston University School of Medicine in 1873 offered a graded course of three years, and in 1877 it 
made this three years’ course compulsory. In 1878 it offered a four years’ medical course, and in 1890 it 
made this course compulsory. In 1907 it instituted an optional five years’ course,
-P-A-G-E-259
  
THE HOMEOPATHIC SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. 221 
to do work that is under the direction and supervision of the medical 
faculty of the college. The University of Michigan Homeopathic 
Medical College has had this requirement for two years. In the 
Hahnemann Medical College of Chicago there is a fifth year which 
is carried on by a special faculty in the medical college itself. In the 
fall of 1915 the premedical year becomes operative in Ohio State 
University Homeopathic Medical College. In the Hahnemann 
Medical College of Philadelphia, besides the work of a premedical year, 
carried on within its walls, a fifth or hospital year is required as a pre- 
requisite to securing a license to practice. This is in accordance with 
the Pennsylvania law. Homeopathic colleges connected with uni- 
versities, of which there are four, and two others by special arrange- 
ment with literary institutions, offer combined courses, making it 
possible for students to obtain a literary and a medical degree in six 
or seven years. During the year 1913-14 there were in attendance 
at these colleges 941 students. This is the largest number since 1907, 
when there were 18 colleges instead of 10. 
It is the aim of homeopathic colleges to educate physicians in the 
broadest acceptation of the term, rather than specialists or scientists. 
The council on medical education of the American Institute of Homeo- 
pathy has made no attempt to grade teaching institutions on a classi- 
fication basis, but endeavors so to improve and equip them that every 
one will give the highest grade of medical teaching and training. 
The colleges of the homeopathic school report to the council on medi- 
cal education of the American Institute of Homeopathy; this organi- 
zation is therefore the only private source from which reliable data 
with regard to them may be secured. The function of the council 
is to insist upon an acceptable standard being maintained in each 
college, which shall harmonize with the laws in the States wherein 
the colleges are located. 
HOSPITAL INSPECTION AND GRADING. 
The council on medical education recognizes that the necessity is 
soon to arise for a graduate to have one year of hospital expe- 
rience before a diploma, or at least a license to practice, be granted 
him. Thus it is necessary to have the hospitals which are to under- 
take this work of finishing the student’s training properly equipped 
and conducted. The council is now engaged, through a committee 
appointed for the special purpose, in the work of hospital inspection 
and grading which is to indicate the suitability of a given hospital to 
receive and train properly educated men and women for medical 
practice. A minimum scale and requirements have been adopted to 
which all must conform. A report of this work will soon be issued. 
The council of education has under way a survey of the medical 
practice of each State in order to determine the approximate propor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-260

tion of its inhabitants employing homeopathic practice. This sur- 
vey has been completed in one of ‘the typical large States with the 
result that approximately 35 per cent of the population are reported 
as employing the homeopathic system of practice and 48 per cent are 
not unfavorably disposed toward it. 
HOMEOPATHIC MEDICAL RESEARCH. 
The earlier transactions of the American Institute of Homeopathy 
dealt almost exclusively with the work of drug testing on the healthy 
human body, which is one of the fundamentals of the homeopathic 
system, and continued attention is still given to this field. 
This work of the study of drug action has been placed by the 
national organization in the hands of a special committee or board 
known as the American Institute of Drug Proving, which is incorpor- 
ated under Federal laws. The members of this board are at present 
as follows: Dr. J. B. Gregg Custis, Washington, D. C., member of the 
board of medical supervisors of the District of Columbia, chairman; 
Dr. E. H. Wolcott, Rochester, N. Y.; Dr. George Royal, Des Moines, 
Iowa, professor of materia medica and therapeutics, Homeopathic 
Medical College of Iowa State University; Dr. W. A. Dewey, professor 
of materia medica and therapeutics, Homeopathic Medical College, 
University of Michigan; Dr. John P. Sutherland, Boston, Mass., 
professor of theory and practice of medicine, Boston University 
School of Medicine; Dr. Rudolph F. Rabe, New York, professor of 
materia medica, New York Homeopathic Medical College and Flower 
Hospital; and Dr. Benjamin F. Bailey, Lincoln, Nebr. The commit- 
tee is carrying on the work of drug testing at the present time. 
There have been recently equipped, in connection with two homeo- 
pathic colleges, large laboratories for the purpose of work in the 
field of drug proving, and another is about to open. 
There has also been much work done in other laboratories con- 
nected with the homeopathic schools. The question of vaccines is 
at the present time receiving much attention, with special reference 
to the action of the various preservatives in the manufacture of 
these substances, a question that has agitated the homeopathic 
school for several years. 
LIST OF SCHOOLS. 
The introduction to the ‘Educational Report of the Council on 
Medical Education of the American Institute of Homeopathy for 
the Years 1912-13” states: 
The council on medical education desires to present to the profession a report of the 
teaching institutions of the homeopathic school of medicine. This report is based 
upon actual inspection and investigation made by members of the council, in com- 
pany with representatives of State boards and organizations of our own school of

medicine, and while all the data obtained, for instance, lists of laboratory apparatus, 
etc., are not here presented, we believe sufficient is given to show that the colleges 
of the homeopathic school of medicine not only are fully equipped to give compre- 
hensive and thorough medical education, but add to this general medical education 
a knowledge of treating and curing the sick on scientific, or what is equivalent thereto, 
homeopathic principles. 
The list of institutions described in this report, with a summary 
of the enrollment figures revised for 1914, is as follows:

PREVIOUS REPORTS ON LEGAL EDUCATION. 
The Bureau of Education has published annually statistics relating 
to law schools, and these indicate, in outline at least, the main devel- 
opment of formal legal education in this country. But not since 1893 
has the bureau published any comprehensive report concerning the 
nonstatistical aspects of legal education. In that year the Bureau of 
Education, as a part of a cooperative arrangement with the committee 
on legal education of the American Bar Association, published in its 
annual volume the admirable report of the committee, which it is 
understood was in the main written by the late Dr. Hammond, of St. 
Louis. In resuming the publication of some discussion of the statis- 
tical material and in commenting upon the tendencies and needs of 
legal education, it is hoped to provoke more general discussion of this 
important subject, and thus to aid in the many movements that dur- 
ing the last few years have been making for a marked advance in the 
standards of legal education in the United States. In view of the long 
interval since the last report of this nature, it seems wise this year to 
treat the statistical matter only in a general way and to stress the 
lines of general development in this field, pointing out wherein the 
greater changes have come, indicating the defects in legal education 
as it exists to-day, and making some suggestions as to changes and 
possible improvements for the future. 
The report of 1893 was devoted mainly to (1) a statement of the 
requirements for admission in the law schools of the country; (2) a 
statement and discussion of the subjects treated in the curricula of 
the law schools of the country; and (3) to an extended and scholarly 
discussion of the desirability of a more systematic treatment of law 
in legal education and in law books. It is proposed now to comment 
upon these three topics with the purpose of showing the changes in

-P-A-G-E-264
    226 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
conditions that have occurred during the past 25 years, and espe- 
cially to give consideration to Dr. Hammond’s plea for a more sys- 
tematic legal education, by which he meant a curriculum that should 
scientifically reduce the body of law to its elements, to be followed by 
an instruction elementary and systematic in the sense thus indicated. 
After a discussion of these subjects an attempt will be made to con- 
sider some of the problems which seem to require early solution. 
IMPROVEMENT IN LAW SCHOOLS. 
At the outset it may be remarked that very great progress has 
been made in almost every phase of legal education. It must be 
admitted, however, that there was sore need of such progress, and 
that the greater part of it has occurred, roughly speaking, during the 
second half of the period indicated. In 1893 there were few law 
schools in the United States giving a really scientific legal education. 
Furthermore, an approximate estimate indicates that at that time at 
least half of the men going to the American bar were not attendants 
at any law school, but were deriving their legal education from private 
study or from study in offices. Poor as American law schools then 
were, they nevertheless gave to their students a much more orderly, 
scientific, and intelligent view of the law than it is possible for ordinary 
men to derive from unsystematic and practically unregulated reading 
in private or in law offices. Unquestionably the fact that so large a 
portion of the American bar then and before then had been trained in 
this unsatisfactory way accounts for many of the defects in the prac- 
tice and administration of law which have been the objects of such 
widespread and violent criticism during the last few years. During 
the period covered in the present report there has been a rapidly 
growing tendency for the prospective lawyer to seek a law school for 
his legal education, and fortunately there has been concurrently an 
equally marked improvement in American law schools. In these two 
tendencies lies the greatest hope for a better, simpler, and more sys- 
tematized body of law, and for a more direct, speedy, and just admin- 
istration of the law in the future. 
Taking up the three points of the 1893 report in order, it is to be 
noted first that at that date no law school in the country required 
that the applicant for admission to its course should have completed 
any college work. The first complete step in this direction was 
taken by the Harvard Law School in 1899, when it put into force a 
requirement of the completion of a college course. As a matter of 
fact, the majority of Harvard law students for a number of years 
had been college graduates, but the formal announcement of this 
requirement gave a distinct impulse to the advance in prelegal 
requirements in law schools throughout the country. The better
-P-A-G-E-265
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION. 227 
law schools then required only a high-school education before the 
beginning of law study, and not all even of these better schools 
were enforcing this requirement in letter and spirit. A common 
practice was to admit students subject to the condition of com- 
pleting the high-school course after admission. This practice of 
placing an extra heavy burden upon the students whose equipment 
was below par was absurd, illogical, and most unfortunate in its 
results. 
Though much still remains to be done, the advance in this respect 
is marked and gratifying. Harvard still requires the completion of 
the college course as prerequisite to admission to the law school. 
Pennsylvania has announced the enforcement of this requirement 
beginning with the year 1915-16. Columbia, Chicago, Stanford, 
Western Reserve, and California require the completion of the 
college course or of three years of such course upon a combined 
college-law curriculum. Cornell, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, 
Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, the University of the Philippines, and 
some others require the completion of two years of college work for 
admission. A number of other institutions require one year of 
college work. North Dakota has announced the requirement of 
two years beginning in the fall of 1917, and many other law schools 
are contemplating similar requirements. It thus appears that all 
or nearly all of the university law schools of the country are now, 
or within two years will be, requiring at least two years of college 
work. Undoubtedly the effect of this requirement will be to lead 
many students who enter college with the purpose of taking only 
the minimum amount, i. e., two years, to go on to the completion 
of three or four years of work. 
These facts are of course most gratifying. They are accompanied, 
however, by a situation which is full of menace for the future and 
which, it is submitted, it is the duty of the American and of State 
bar associations to grapple with earnestly, intelligently, and cour- 
ageously. That danger lies in the fact that a large number of law 
schools are private and proprietary, avowedly or actually. Many of 
these schools are night schools. By this it is not intended to say 
that all night schools are bad; but obviously, under ordinary con- 
ditions at least, a school conducted upon the night basis, whose 
students and faculty are engaged in other work during the larger 
portion of their working hours, can not hope to and in fact does not 
do as much work or as good work as the better day schools are 
accomplishing. Many of these proprietary schools are owned and 
managed by conscientious and intelligent men, but it is quite obvious 
that, as these schools must be run for profit and could not continue 
to be operated at a loss, their proprietors must consider the extent 
of their patronage. This inevitably means the maintenance of low  
-P-A-G-E-266
    228 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
standards of admission and low standards of work in the school in 
the majority of cases. The larger interests of the State, the pro- 
fession, and the requirements of justice can not and certainly are 
not taken into consideration to anything like the extent to which 
they are considered in the law schools actually maintained by the 
stronger universities of the country. This situation has prevented 
the raising of admission standards in schools of this type. The 
inevitable consequence will be that the student who cares little for 
general education, for culture, and for breadth of view, but who 
aims only at getting to the bar for money-making purposes in the 
shortest possible time and at the least possible expenditure of effort 
and money will attend the school with low standards and low require- 
ments. Unless this tendency is checked, much of the good that the 
better university schools are attempting to accomplish, at the 
expense of loss in students and money to themselves, will be offset 
by the schools run mainly for revenue only. This is no idle specula- 
tion, but a real condition, which must be grappled with vigorously 
and promptly. The greater number of these proprietary schools 
profess to require the completion of a high-school course as pre- 
requisite to admission to law study. In reality the requirement is 
not enforced in most of these schools. In many of them, students 
who have had only a partial high-school course or none at all are 
admitted, subject to “conditions.” These “conditions” are removed 
by taking examinations from time to time on the basis of study 
pursued in private, and sometimes in coaching schools maintained 
by the law school for this purpose. 
LAW SCHOOLS VERSUS LAW OFFICES IN LEGAL TRAINING. 
In 1892 the committee on legal education of the American Bar 
Association reported that it had no means of ascertaining the number 
of students who were pursuing their studies in offices, nor the courses 
of study pursued by them. The 1911 report of the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for the Advancement of Teaching contained an estimate that 
perhaps one-third of the men then going to the bar had studied in 
private or in law offices. This was probably somewhat of an over- 
estimate; certainly the proportion of such students is smaller now. 
In nearly all of the entire tier of Northern States, and in the middle 
group extending from ocean to ocean, comparatively few students 
are now thus preparing for the bar. In the State of Michigan, for 
example, less than 5 per cent of those admitted to the bar during 
the past five years have been without training in law schools. In 
some of the Southern States the practice of preparing by office study 
still persists, but with the notable increase in good law schools in the 
South during the last few years a speedy decline may be expected
-P-A-G-E-267
  
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION. 229 
in the number of office-trained applicants for admission to the bar. 
‘This marked change in tendency is cause for unqualified gratification. 
Even at its best, in the old days this method of preparation for the 
bar was decidedly bad. Unquestionably, the training thus obtained 
tended to make the lawyer dogmatic, legalistic, and formalistic. He 
perhaps became an expert dialectician and knew a great deal of law. 
But, generally speaking, he knew it in an unscientific way, he had 
little conception of its historical and evolutionary character, and he 
stood like adamant against the changes desired by society in general 
and made necessary by the continuous process of change in business, 
industry, and the general life of the community. With the develop- 
ment of the modern law office, the conditions under which office 
study was conducted became much worse. With the tendency to 
division of labor that has invaded even the professions, with modern 
mechanical methods of efficiency, with the intensity and pressure of 
modern law practice, the lawyer has had little time to give to advising, 
examining, and otherwise aiding the student in his office. For these 
and many other reasons it is to be hoped that the States will soon 
require study in reputable law schools as prerequisite to admission 
to the bar. In medicine, either as a requirement of law or as a 
matter of well-settled practice, every State in the Union now requires 
that the applicant for a license to practice medicine must be a gradu- 
ate of an accepted medical school. There is absolutely no sound 
reason for this requirement that does not apply equally or in greater 
measure to the method of preparation for admission to the bar. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION. 
Within the law schools advances have been as gratifying as has 
been the increase in entrance requirements. Of the 58 law schools 
concerning which statistics were given in the report for 1892, only 9 
offered a three years’ course of instruction, and there is good reason 
to believe that not all of these 9 schools were rigorously requiring 
three years of study for graduation. At that time at least 5 schools 
were conferring degrees at the end of one year of study, and about 
35 schools gave only two years of instruction. In the report of 1893 
it was said: 
In considering the subject of a course of study in American law schools the com- 
mittee are embarrassed by the fact that a longer course than two years is impracticable 
for the greater number of schools. The competition of life is growing stronger all the 
time, and is urging young men into active, breadwinning occupations early in life. 
The youth of America, as a rule, wish to be independent. The sentiment of the 
profession and the public will not sustain, at least in some parts of the country, a 
longer course than two years, and even this is impracticable in some places. 
And yet it will take a student at least two years under present methods to acquire a 
competent knowledge of the subjects of private law referred to, to fit him for practice. 
There is little time he can devote to public law, the history and theory of the law, and  
-P-A-G-E-268

230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the science of government, unless our methods of instruction are so improved as to 
save the time now given to the mere memorizing of practical rules and points of law, 
of no real service to the beginner, and to employ it on these topics, indispensable in 
a true system of legal education. 
The committee then added: 
Yet, recognizing the fact that a course of more than two years is impracticable for 
most, the committee recommend: 
1. That for those to whom a longer course of study is possible, provision be made 
in the schools for postgraduate courses, where the subjects of general jurisprudence 
and public law shall be taught. 
2. A system of electives, now found necessary in almost every branch of education 
by reason of the extent of human learning, and already existing in several of the 
schools, in which shall be required in addition to the usual course in private law 
‘already described, to pursue at least a certain number of subjects in public law, inter- 
national law, the history and theory of the law, comparative jurisprudence, and the 
science of government. 
3. Better preliminary training, if practicable. A large proportion of the schools 
require no entrance examination, and in none of them is the entrance examination 
equivalent to that for the A. B. degree in any reputable college in the country. 
Much progress has been made since then. The Bureau of Educa- 
tion gives statistical data for the year 1913-14 for 122 law schools. 
Of these only one reports a curriculum of but one year, 17 have cur- 
ricula of two years, and the remaining schools require at least three 
years for graduation.t Several of the stronger schools, including 
Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Chicago, Wiscon- 
sin, Minnesota, Stanford, and California, are offering courses that 
would require from four to six years to complete at the normal rate. 
In the University of Michigan, for example, including a group of 
studies which might be regarded perhaps as extralegal, such as the 
history of English law, a course in the continental legal philosophies, 
Roman law, public international law, the theory of practice and leg- 
islation, a full six years would be required for the completion of all 
of the work offered. This has meant, of course, a wide development 
of the elective system recommended in the report of 1893. In the 
schools in which the elective system has been developed, it has been 
the policy to require the taking of at least some of the subjects which 
may be regarded as fundamental, such as contracts, torts, property, 
and pleading. Nominally, there is considerable variation in the dif- 
ferent schools in which the elective principle is recognized as to the 
extent to which that principle is followed. In practice the conditions 
do not differ materially. 
When the elective plan in law schools was still young, it was feared 
by some that it would produce a fragmentary and partial legal train- 
ing for many students. The objections offered were of two principal 
kinds: First, that the students would not make wise choice among 
1 Among these are 11 evening schools requiring four years. 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION. 231 
the courses offered; that they would be inclined to follow the lines of 
least resistance, or in other words, to take easy courses without refer- 
ence to the subject, or that they would omit fundamental or important 
practical courses. The second objection perhaps grows out of the 
first, namely, that as applicants for admission to the bar examina- 
tions, and later as practicing lawyers, the men would be handicapped 
by reason of their ignorance of those subjects not elected. Neither 
of these objections has proved to be well founded. Students on the 
whole have shown good judgment in making their elections. They 
have sought the advice of members of the faculty and of lawyers, 
and moreover, succeeding classes have helped each other to obtain 
the best results in this matter. As to the second objection, it is 
undoubtedly true that more applicants for admission to the bar fail 
upon examination than formerly. This is clearly due, however, to 
the great and commendable advance made in most of the States 
during the past 15 years in requiring some proof worthy of the name 
of the mastery of the principles of law on the part of those seeking 
admission to the bar. There has been a very decided raising of the 
standards in this respect, though much yet remains to be done. 
Unquestionably, law graduates of the present day are on the average 
much better prepared for the practice of law than were those of 20 
or 25 years ago. The increasing emphasis on training in legal think- 
ing and legal analysis has fitted the student to study by himself those 
subjects which he did not take in the law school. 
Nevertheless, there has been a growing feeling on the part of law 
teachers that the course ought if possible to be increased to four 
years. Ten years ago a suggestion that this might be done was 
greeted with disapprobation, if not with derision, by some of the best 
law teachers in the country. But at the annual meeting of the 
Association of American Law Schools, held in Chicago in December, 
1914, the policy of requiring four years of law study, though only 
tentatively proposed, was received and discussed seriously and with 
much favor. There are obvious objections. The time and expense 
necessary for the completion of the law course in any of the better 
law schools to-day is already a serious burden to a poor man. There 
are strong economic and social reasons why the lawyer should begin 
to be self-supporting and to be able to maintain a family as early as 
possible. Moreover, it is desirable that a lawyer should begin his 
practice while he is still adaptable mentally and otherwise. Never- 
theless, the great expansion of the body of our law, the increasing 
difficulty of meeting the requirements of modern business and legal 
conditions, and the increasingly insistent demand from the laity for 
a higher degree of professional efficiency are exerting a pressure for 
a longer law course which it may be difficult to resist. Perhaps it 
should be added that the increase in the volume of law is by no
-P-A-G-E-270
  232 EDUCATION REPORT, i914. 
means merely cumulative. While the old principles of justice may 
always endure, certainly the new conditions in modern society call 
for different applications of them. As a result, we have great fields 
of law which are to all intents new, and these fields must be explored 
by anyone who would become a thoroughly competent lawyer. It is 
necessary only to mention the vast growth in public law, including 
particularly some phases of constitutional law and the law dealing 
with public corporations and public utilities, to enforce the point 
made. Moreover, the law of torts is undergoing radical and swift 
changes; property law, at least in the larger cities, is becoming more 
and more complicated; and the vast body of statutory law can no 
longer be safely or properly ignored in any adequate legal education. 
To some extent this pressure for a longer curriculum has been met 
in several of the schools by offering an optional fourth year, leading 
to a second degree in law. This will do very little to solve the 
problem, however. In the first place, if the law schools grant the 
first degree for three years of study, and if the laws of the several 
States permit one to practice after only three years of study, very few 
students will feel inclined or able to take the fourth year. Compe- 
tition decisively settles the problem for them in favor of the shorter 
course. Moreover, nearly all of those few who take the fourth year 
of law work in such schools as Harvard or Michigan do so to prepare 
themselves for the teaching of law or for some other special purpose. 
It will require compulsory action by the schools and probably by the 
laws of the several States relating to admission to the bar to effect a 
general lengthening of the course. This is true despite the fact that 
many students themselves feel the need of a longer period of legal 
study and have said that they wished the law school would take the 
forward step and require a fourth year of work. The summer session 
or the summer quarter of law work now offered in several schools 
offers a partial solution of this problem, and not a few students are 
already availing themselves of this means of acquiring a more exten- 
sive and thorough legal training. 
CONTENT OF THE LAW SCHOOL CURRICULUM. 
Akin to the topic just treated is that of the content of the law 
school curriculum. In this respect, too, there has been much im- 
provement since 1893. The report of that year criticised the law 
curricula of the country as too closely confined to practical private 
law and to the technical rather than the scientific or philosophic view 
of law. It is and always must remain the main business of a law 
school to treat thoroughly the principal branches of private law. 
But among the leaders in legal education at least there is a growing 
tendency to supplement this study with at least some view of law in
-P-A-G-E-271
  
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION. 233 
its larger and philosophic aspects. Among those who favor such a 
reform, some would give instruction at the outset of the course in 
the elements of law in the scientific sense of that term, including a 
study of jurisprudence and perhaps of the leading philosophies of 
law, and then build the superstructure in private law upon these as 
a foundation. A strong argument may be made for this view. In 
practice, however, this method has thus far been found difficult of 
realization, if not quite ineffective. Consequently we find the courses 
in legal history, legal philosophy, jurisprudence, and comparative 
law offered to seniors or to graduate students. A priori one might 
suppose that the scientific method of teaching law would be to begin 
with the elements of law systematically arranged and to make a 
study of jurisprudence as a basis for the study of any particular 
system of law. It may be doubted, however, whether this plan will 
ever succeed, at least for the English common law. It has been 
amply demonstrated that nothing is more difficult for the beginning 
student to master than the abstract, in whatever science he may be 
pursuing. The average student, even among well-trained men, finds 
it difficult to understand and retain mere abstract juristic principles. 
Once he has studied a particular system of law and made the myriad 
applications of it which the modern method of legal education requires, 
he is in a position to approach intelligently jurisprudence as a science 
and to enter into the spirit of legal philosophy. 
Since the publication of the committee report of 1893 nearly all of 
the stronger university law schools have added to their curricula 
courses in administrative law, private international law, public 
officers, and some other associated topics. Public international law 
is taught in two or three law schools regularly, but is made available 
to law students in a large number of other law schools that are 
departments of universities in which this topic is treated in the col- 
lege or arts department. The comment of the 1893 report was that 
the confining of the curriculum to merely private-law subjects tended 
to produce an unphilosophic, narrow, and legalistic attitude toward 
jaw. The addition since then of the courses indicated in this and 
the preceding paragraph has done something at least to correct this 
tendency. Perhaps even more in the same direction has been accom- 
plished by increasing the emphasis throughout the curriculum upon 
the historical and evolutionary development of law. 
TEACHING PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE. 
The matter of teaching practice and procedure in law schools has 
been a serious problem for a number of years. The report of 1893 
states that the moot court was then ‘‘one of the most common, as 
well as the most useful, exercises a student can practice.” Never- 
   
-P-A-G-E-272
234 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
theless, some very strong indictments have been brought against the 
moot court, at least in its early form. It has been vigorously argued 
that practice can not be successfully taught in the law school, and 
that therefore time given to that exercise might be much better 
employed in teaching substantive law, with pleading and evidence 
added. Despite these objections, an increasing amount of time and 
effort has been given to the whole subject of teaching procedure, and 
while there are still differences of opinion about the matter, it may 
fairly be said that in the more highly developed form of recent years 
the practice court and the practice courses have met most of the 
early objections and are recognized to be legitimate and very impor- 
tant parts of the curriculum. 
In the main the objections have been based upon the supposition 
that tho principal function of the moot or practice court was to 
offer a sort of advance rehearsal of the dramatic features of a law 
trial and that as it was impossible to reproduce the conditions under 
which actual cases are tried the effort must in large measure fail. 
No doubt there are moot courts still conducted on this plan, but in 
the stronger schools the practice court of to-day proposes for itself 
a very different function. The practice court is but the final stage 
in the teaching of practice. The general principles of practice are 
taught by means of the study of scientifically collected cases on 
the subject, and then the preparation of process and pleadings 
and the trial of cases follow much as laboratory work follows the 
study of theory in the sciences. The present tendency therefore 
is to make of the practice court not at all an imitation of or mere 
rehearsal for actual court work, but a stage in the educational process. 
While the successive steps of a trial are gone through with under 
conditions sufficiently accurate to make the experience valuable as 
an initiation into trial work, the main purpose is to show how these 
steps are correlated and brought together in the integral thing 
which we call a trial. It may well be that some schools are so cir- 
cumstanced with reference to the type of work they do and the 
immediate occupation of most of their graduates that it is not impor- 
tant for them to do this work. Some variation indeed in the methods 
of law schools throughout the curriculum is desirable. Certainly 
some of the schools that have put the study and teaching of pro- 
cedure upon a scientific basis are contributing to the general cause 
of procedural reform and are turning out students who show the 
value of this training."

RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION. 235 
METHODS OF TEACHING. 
In 1893 the American Bar Association committee gave some 
account of the underlying theories and the methods of the three 
principal methods of teaching law, namely, the lecture system, the 
textbook system, and the case system. The advantages and dis- 
advantages of these were pointed out, but no decided preference 
was indicated for any one of them. At that time all three methods 
were still strongly entrenched, though the lecture system was un- 
doubtedly losing in the contest for supremacy. To-day the case 
method forms the principal, if not the exclusive, method of teaching 
in nearly all of the stronger law schools of the country. Lectures 
on special subjects are of course still delivered in all law schools, and 
this doubtless always will be the case. But for staple instruction 
in the important branches of the common law the case has approved 
itself as the best available material for use practically everywhere. 
There are still some schools the catalogues of which announce that 
they are not wedded to any one system of instruction, but make a 
judicious use of all of the approved types, stressing each as the 
nature of the subject may require. No good school whose faculty 
is capable of independent thinking would nail to the mast the flag 
of any particular instructional method as the one to sink or swim 
with. As the law changes, methods of teaching it also must change. 
Even among followers of the so-called case method, there are wide 
variations among individual teachers. A truly scientifically pre- 
pared textbook will always have its place for teachers, students, 
and practicing lawyers, and the lecture is still necessary for some 
special topics. It is respectfully submitted, however, that of all 
ineffective, because the most incomplete, superficial, and confused 
of methods, the so-called ‘‘combination method”’ is the worst. It 
js neither fish, flesh, nor fowl. From it the student must fail to 
receive the orderly, coordinated view of the subject which should be 
given to him by a good law school. No one view of the law is given 
in its entirety. In this so-called combination method the case is in 
reality used merely as an illustration of the principle stated abstractly 
in the lecture or textbook. So used the case is of course not wholly 
without value. But the student who has followed this method has 
failed almost completely to receive a view of law and a training in 
legal thinking to be obtained from the study of its primary statement. 
The report of 1893 objected to calling the case the ‘‘source of law.” 
In one sense the objection is well founded, but at least it may be said 
that in Anglo-American law the case is the primary and the only 
authoritative statement of law. For this reason, and because the 
lawyer is to deal with the material in this form throughout his pro- 
fessional life, it is highly important that he get a first-hand, system- 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
tic, and comprehensive instruction and training in the use of this 
material. A few cases, or for that matter many cases, used illus- 
tratively will wholly fail to produce this result. 
For the reasons thus briefly indicated the case method is to-day 
the principal method of instruction in the great majority of the schools 
of this country. It may indeed be desirable, as was said in the report 
of 1893, that law be taught more with a view to its elements and to 
its system than is possible under present methods. But our inability 
at the present time to approach law in this way is not due in any 
degree to the use of the cases. The truth is that Anglo-American 
law is not yet an exact science nor a complete system. In some 
respects it is less so than when Blackstone and Kent wrote the only 
great systematic treatises of the English common law. Granted 
that many principles of law relating to contracts and property, for 
example, are now well settled, the fact remains that our body of 
law as an entirety is passing through perhaps its period of greatest 
change and transition. Certainly this is true in respect to many 
topics. This being the condition of the law, it is obviously impos- 
sible to make a scientific and systematic statement of it, based upon 
its supposed elements. No such pretended statement could be true 
or accurate. Hence the impossibility of teaching law as if it had 
been reduced to anything which might properly be called the corpus 
juris. In the accepted sense of that term, we have no corpus juris, 
despite the ambitious and unwarranted use of that term made for 
commercial purposes in some quarters. A great deal of scholarly 
work has now been done which may prepare the way for a corpus 
juris in a not too distant future, but at present it is nonexistent. 
ADMISSION TO THE BAR. 
This report has been confined primarily to a discussion of legal 
education, but some mention of conditions with reference to admis- 
sion to the bar may be appropriate. As was indicated in the earlier 
part of the chapter, great advances have been made in this respect. 
An examination of the reports of the committee on legal education 
of the American Bar Association, many of which have been admirable, 
will show how great has been the progress in this respect. Twenty- 
five years ago examinations for admission to the bar were in most 
States either unknown or more a subject of jest than of serious 
attention. To-day more than three-fourths of the States have what 
may reasonably be considered acceptable laws relating to admission 
to the bar—laws that are administered either by the courts directly 
or by boards of examiners appointed by them or provided for in the 
statute. The examinations are not always scientifically conducted, 
but in most of the States they are honest and genuine tests, to pass
-P-A-G-E-275
  
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION. 237 
which requires at least a reasonable degree of proficiency. Most of 
the States now require, as preliminary to the taking of bar examina- 
tions, a high-school education and the completion of three years of 
law study. The State of Michigan has made a distinct advance in 
requiring that those applicants for the bar who are not graduates of 
a respectable law school shall have studied law at least four years 
instead of the three required of law-school graduates. This puts 
an effective and very salutary check in that State upon the practice 
of going to the bar by unregulated office or private study or by means 
of instruction in correspondence law schools. 
The matter of requiring an apprenticeship of one year or more in a 
law office before the graduate in law shall be eligible to admission to 
the bar has been debated in the American Bar Association and in 
several of the State bar associations, particularly in New York. 
Theoretically this move is in the right direction. In Germany, 
France, and some other countries a long apprenticeship of this sort 
is required, and the effects are beneficial. It may be doubted, 
however, whether the results would be as satisfactory in this country, 
where law offices are on a more commercial basis, and are not stand- 
ardized, so that they are not in as strong position to be helpful to 
students as in other countries. In this and in many other matters 
relating to legal education and admission to the bar, the activities 
of the American Bar Association have been most helpful. 
THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LAW SCHOOLS. 
One of the greatest single factors in the progress made during the 
last few years is the Association of American Law Schools. This 
association was organized in 1900, for the ‘‘improvement of legal 
education in America, especially in the law schools.’ The asso- 
ciation is composed of law schools which require the completion of a 
four-year high-school course for admission, which offer a course of 
three years of at least 30 weeks each, and which have law libraries 
of not less than 5,000 volumes. Forty-five schools are now members 
of this association. 
The establishment and maintenance of the eligibility requirements 
as thus indicated have been a great stimulus to advance in these 
respects in many law schools. At the annual meetings, papers on 
subjects relating to legal education are read and there is general dis- 
cussion of the papers. These papers and discussions have been 
instructive and stimulating to the law teachers of the entire country. 
Many questions have been thrashed out thoroughly and an approach 
to a reasonable standardization in law-school methods has resulted. 
The work of the association during the first 15 years of its life has 
been confined largely to the matters above referred to. There has 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
238 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
| been a disposition to criticize the association for not having been 
more vigorous in its policies and action. It may well be doubted, 
| however, whether a voluntary organization of this kind could have 
undertaken effectively more than the association has accomplished. 
During the greater part of that period it has been the wise course to 
encourage and stimulate rather than to criticize and attack schools 
which were at least endeavoring to live up to the requirements of 
the association. Notable advancement has been made in most of our 
law schools since the organization of this association, however, and 
perhaps the time has now come when those schools which are not 
fully and fairly living up to the reasonable requisites for membership 
should be regarded and treated as standing squarely in the pathway 
of progress and reform in legal education. 
THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION INQUIRY. 
This paper should scarcely close without a reference to the inves- 
tigation of legal education and admission to the bar now being con- 
ducted by the Carnegie foundation. The foundation has now been 
prosecuting this study for nearly two years, and is making a most 
thorough examination into the claims and the actual practice of all 
of the law schools of the country. This investigation covers every 
aspect of law-school work, including the important matter of method 
| of instruction. The foundation is also making an exhaustive study 
of the laws, rules, and practice of every State relating to admission 
to the bar. The result should be a mass of information, analyzed 
and systematized, of the utmost value, since the work is in thor- 
| oughly competent hands and is apparently being conducted with 
| impartiality, thoroughness, and intelligence.*

ConTENTs.—Report of the commission on national aid to vocational education—Training teachers for vocational education—Investigations and surveys—State systems of vocational education—Organi- 
zations interested in vocational education—New positions created—A chievements in typical centers. 
The movement for vocational education in the United States at 
the present time is a complex of forces, representing diversity of 
motive, if not of objective, and operating in an arena too vast to be 
comprehended in a single glance. To undertake a summary of the 
year’s progress for presentation within the limits of a few pages is a 
big task, and he who essays it must be careful not to claim too much 
in respect to breadth of vision. This chapter has been prepared 
after consultation with many of the recognized leaders in all parts 
of the country, and their assistance, by way of reports and sugges- 
tions, is here cordially acknowledged. 
1. COMMISSION ON NATIONAL AID TO VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
The important event of the year in vocational education was 
the appointment by President Wilson, pursuant to act of Congress 
approved January 20, 1914, of a commission of nine members “to 
consider the subject of national aid for vocational education and re- 
port their findings and recommendations not later than June 1.” 
The following persons were appointed to serve as members of the 
commission: 
Senator Hoke Smith, Georgia. 
Senator Carroll S. Page, Vermont. 
Representative D. M. Hughes, Georgia. 
Representative S. D. Fess, Ohio. 
John A. Lapp, director Indiana bureau of legislative information, Indianapolis, 
Ind.; secretary of Indiana commission on industrial and agricultural education, 
1912. 
Miss Florence M. Marshall, director Manhattan Trade School, New York City; 
member of Massachusetts factory inspection commission, 1910. 
Miss Agnes Nestor, president International Glove Workers’ Union, Chicago, IIl.; 
member of committee on industrial education, American Federation of Labor. 
Charles A. Prosser, secretary National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Edu- 
cation, New York City. 
Charles H. Winslow, special agent, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, D. C.; 
member of Massachusetts commission on industrial education, 1906-1909. 
239  
-P-A-G-E-278
  240 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The commission organized April 2, 1914, by electing Hon. Hoke 
Smith, Senator from Georgia, as chairman. Mr. Ernest A. Wreidt, 
director, Public Education: Association, New York, N. Y., was 
appointed secretary April 17, 1914. An office and statistical staff of 
45 persons assisted in the work. 
On June 1, 1914, the commission made its report to Congress, after 
six weeks of strenuous activity that included a number of public 
hearings, conferences with representatives of all interested depart- 
ments and bureaus of the Federal Government, examination of the 
results yielded by questionnaires, as well as independent study and 
research. The report was issued from the Government Printing 
Office in August as H. Doc. No. 1004, in two volumes: I. Report of 
the commission, with text of the proposed legislation; II. Hearings 
before the commission. 
The bill for the proposed act prepared and recommended by the 
commission was introduced into the House by Representative 
Hughes, of Georgia; and into the Senate by Senator Hoke Smith, of 
Georgia. In each case the bill was referred to the committee on 
education. 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION. 
Interested persons are referred to the published report for the full 
text of the recommendations of the commission, and the proposed 
law. The following is a condensed summary: 
I. SCOPE OF THE GRANTS. 
1. That national grants be given to the States for the purpose of stimulating voca- 
tional education in agriculture and in the trades and industries. 
2. That grants be given in two forms: 
(a) For the training of teachers of agricultural, trade and industrial, and home 
economics subjects. 
(b) For the paying of part of the salaries of teachers, supervisors, and directors of 
agricultural subjects and of teachers of trade and industrial subjects. 
3. That appropriations be made to a Federal board for making studies and investi- 
gations which shall be of use in vocational schools. 
Ul. AMOUNT OF THE GRANTS. 
1. For the salaries of teachers, supervisors, and directors of agricultural subjects— 
that there be appropriated to the States the sum of $500,000 for the fiscal year 1915-16; 
this amount to be increased at the rate of $250,000 a year until a total of $2,000,000 is 
reached in the fiscal year 1921-22, and thereafter the annual increase to be at the rate 
of $500,090 a year until a total maximum appropriation of $3,000,000 is reached in 
1923-24. 
2. For the salaries of teachers of trade and industrial subjects—that there be appro- 
priated to the States the sum of $500,000 for the fiscal year 1915-16; this annual 
amount being increased for each subsequent year in the same manner as the grants 
for the teachers of agricultural subjects, until the same maximum of $3,000,000 is 
reached in 1923-24. — 
3. For the training of teachers of agricultural, trade and industrial, and home 
economics subjects—that there be appropriated to the States the sum of $500,000 for
-P-A-G-E-279
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 241 
the fiscal year 1915-16; $700,000 for the fiscal year 1916-17; $900,000 for the fiscal 
year 1917-18; $1,000,000 for the fiscal year 1918-19, and annually thereafter. 
4, For the work of the Federal board for vocational education—that there be 
appropriated $200,000 annually, this money to be used in administering the grants 
to the States and in furnishing information and advice to the States for use in voca- 
tional schools and classes. 
The maximum in each case above is continued annually thereafter. 
Ill, KINDS OF SCHOOLS AIDED BY GRANTS. 
1. That the schools aided in part by the National Government should be schools 
supported and controlled by the public. 
2, That the education given in these schools should be of less than college grade. 
3. That they should be designed to prepare boys and girls over 14 years of age for 
useful or profitable employment in agriculture and in the trades and industries. 
4, That the schools should be of three types, in order to meet a variety of needs: 
(a) All-day schools in which practically half of the time should be given to actual 
practice for a vocation on a useful or productive basis. 
(6) Part-time schools for young workers over 14 years of age, which should either 
extend their vocational knowledge or give preparation for entrance to a vocation, or 
extend the general civic or vocational intelligence of the pupils. 
(c) Evening schools to extend the vocational knowledge for mature workers over 
16 years of age. 
IV. ADMINISTRATION. 
1. That the States, in order to receive national grants for vocational education; 
designate or create State boards, through whom the National Government would deal, 
the determination of such boards to be left entirely to the States. 
2, That a Federal board be created, consisting of the Postmaster General, the 
Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, 
and the Secretary of Labor, with the Commissioner of Education as its executive 
officer, to administer the funds and to cooperate with the States in promoting voca- 
tional education. 
Vv. CONDITIONS. 
1. That the Federal statute providing for national grants to the States for voca- 
tional education set up conditions safeguarding the proper expenditure of the money 
for the purposes designed and insuring a maximum degree of efficiency in the work, 
2. That the States, through their legislative authorities, formally accept the con- 
ditions of the Federal statute providing national grants. 
3. That the States provide for the proper custody and disbursement of the Federal 
grants allotted to them, 
4. That the State board, with the approval of the Federal board for vocational 
education, formulate plans for the administration of the grants in conformity with 
the provisions of the Federal statute, and establish minimum requirements for the 
State as to the qualifications of teachers and the equipment of schools. 
5. That for each dollar paid from Federal grants allotted to any State for the salaries 
of vocational teachers, or for the training of vocational teachers, the State or local 
community, or both, shall expend an equal amount for the same purpose, and shall 
in addition meet all other costs of plant, equipment, and maintenance, including 
the salaries of all teachers necessary to complete well-rounded courses of instruction. 
6. That the State receive its allotment annually so long as it uses the funds allotted - 
to it in conformity with the purposes and provisions of the Federal statute. Payment 
on allotments shall be made quarterly.

2. TRAINING TEACHERS FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
In no way can the progress of vocational education be better 
understood than by a study of the measures adopted to insure a 
supply of properly qualified teachers. The efficiency with which 
this work is done will have as great a determining influence upon 
further progress in the immediate future as any other one thing. 
The inadequacy of the supply of teachers, which was pointed out 
in the last report,! still exists, and constitutes one of the most serious 
obstacles in the way of development. The two chief elements in the 
equipment of the special vocational teacher are: (1) Mastery of the 
technic of the occupation, and (2) teaching ability. The difficulty 
of securing these two elements in combination in the same individual 
is inherent in the situation. 
It seems to be generally agreed that the only practicable way to 
obtain the necessary knowledge of the vocation is to serve for a time 
as an actual wage earner in it. For most vocations, having sufficient 
content to justify the provision of opportunities for training for 
them, this means entrance on the part of the individual at a fairly 
early age, the serving of a period of learning or apprenticeship, fol- 
lowed by a period as finished worker or journeyman long enough to 
achieve actual success in the vocation. This program necessarily 
brings the individual to a minimum stage of maturity and involves 
the relinquishment of opportunities for development or training in 
other directions. 
The second of the essential elements, teaching ability, can be 
acquired efficiently in only two ways: By years of actual teaching 
experience under competent and sympathetic supervision, or by 
specific training. In either case the difficulties in the way of satis- 
factory adjustment and ultimate success in the work probably in- 
crease as the square of the age of the candidate at the time of 
beginning. 
It is useless, therefore, to talk about the equipment of the ideal 
teacher for vocational schools as something likely to be available in 
the near future. It is necessary, while laying plans that will eventu- 
ate in ideals in due time, to make some adjustment that will meet 
present conditions as they are. Hence the large number of signifi- 
cant experiments now under way in different parts of the country. 
The most promising plan, so far as present tendencies give indica- 
tion, is the attempt to provide the necessary training in principles 
and methods of teaching for men and women actually engaged as wage 
earners in the occupations they propose to teach. By providing this 
instruction in evening classes, and by providing later opportunities 
for the initial experience in teaching in evening schools, it is possible

PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 243 
to try out individual candidates and to obtain a fairly accurate de- 
termination of their fitness for teaching before they abandon the 
wage-earning status in the occupation itself. : 
Not all of the experiments can be described here, but a number of 
the most prominent ones are mentioned. It is to be hoped that 
many other institutions which have the facilities for making some 
contribution to this great problem of teacher training will be stimu- 
lated to earnest effort. 
PRATT INSTITUTE, BROOKLYN, N. Y. 
The class consisted of 17 men who were working at various trades during the day 
and were brought together in an evening class to receive instruction in the principles 
of teaching as applied to the industrial school. The class met three times a week for 
a period of 24 weeks, each session being two hours in length. 
The purpose of the course was to train men to become teachers of shopwork in 
either day or evening industrial schools. The instruction did not include shopwork 
practice or related trade subjects, but was confined to the principles of trade teaching. 
It was expected that the candidate would bring to the class the thorough trade knowl- 
edge and training in related trade subjects essential to the successful shop teacher. 
No applicant was accepted who was under 24 years of age or over 40, or who could not 
show an all-round experience in his trade covering at least 5 years above apprentice- 
ship. No written test for entrance was given, but candidates were required to fill 
out an application blank giving in detail their training and experience, and to submit 
recommendations as to trade fitness. The personal qualifications of each candidate 
were carefully rated in an interview with the instructor of the class, and his trade 
equipment was passed upon by a mechanic experienced in the same trade. 
Applications were made by 60 men, and of this number 20 were accepted, of whom * 
18 actually started the course. One withdrew at the end of six weeks, 17 remaining 
to complete the work. Those selected represented the following trades: Machinist, 
carpenter, machine draftsman, electrician, pattern maker, plumber. 
The training given consisted of two parts: (1) Practice teaching in the New York 
evening trade schools, one evening each week. (The majority of the class taught two 
evenings a week, the second evening being optional.) (2) Class work at Pratt Insti- 
tute, two evenings each week. 
In the practice teaching, the pupil teacher served as a helper to the regular trade 
teacher in charge of the shop. In some instances the pupil teacher was given a divi- 
sion of the class for which he was made responsible under the direction of the shop 
_ teacher. One evening each week the instructor of the training class visited the 
various classes in which the pupil teachers were serving, for the purpose of giving 
assistance and direction to the practice work. Members of the class were required 
to submit weekly written reports on their practice teaching. These reports were later 
made the subject of class discussions. 
The class work at Pratt Institute consisted of two parts: (1) Demonstration work in 
the form of practice teaching before the class, and (2) conference and lecture work 
on a ‘‘short-unit” basis. 
In the demonstration work, members of the class were required to bring in problems 
in shop practice and related shop knowledge which had arisen in their practical 
experience, and present these to the class in the form of lessons. The demonstration 
was then thrown open to discussion. 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  244 ~ EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The conference and lecture work consisted of discussions, readings, and occasional 
lectures upon such subjects as the following: 
1. The organization and equipment of the trade-school shop. 
. Analyzing a trade for the purposes of instruction 
. The commercial product. 
. The project scheme. 
. The teaching of ‘‘related work.” 
. Basis of the course of study. 
. The organization of the industrial school. 
. How to handle the industrial school boy. 
. The qualifications of the industrial school-teacher. 
10. Types of school—their organization and function. 
11. What is education? 
12. The difference between vocational education and general education. 
13. The difference between vocational education, on the one hand, and prevoca- 
tional education, practical arts, and manual training, on the other. 
The method of instruction in the classroom in general was to select a given topic or 
unit, approach it through a series of questions based on the practical experience of the 
members of the class, follow these questions with lecture work and assigned readings, 
conclude the instruction with questions for discussion drawn out of the material thus 
given. The aim of this method of instruction was to establish a connection between 
the prospective teacher’s shop experience and the new knowledge to be acquired on 
the one hand, and to-arouse his self-activity through discussion on the other. With 
these men the method seemed to work well. 
It is expected that this course will be continued next year on essentially the same 
plan. It is hoped that the following features may be worked out: (1) A more careful 
selection of the membership of the class with reference to trade experience. While 
the men chosen last year were in every sense selected men, a more rigid selection 
can be made. A greater variety of trades should also be represented in the class mem- 
bership. (2) A reorganization of the subject matter presented for the purpose of (a) 
giving a simpler unit, (b) making clear the aim and method of the teaching process as 
contrasted with the shop processes, and (c) showing the relationship of the various 
units to the teaching process. COMA TA WD 
STATE COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS, ALBANY, N. Y. 
The special class for mechanics, in 1913-14, had a membership of 18, as follows: 
Machinists, 8; patternmakers, 2; plumber, 1; general woodworkers, 7. This class has 
completed a course of two winters, 25 weeks each, 3 nights per week. Two nights 
each week were devoted to regular classroom and shopwork, including methods of 
teaching, shop practice and management, drawing, shop mathematics. The third 
night was devoted to practice teaching, which was provided for by three apprentice- 
ship classes, supported by the city, under the direction of the college. The practice 
teaching was supervised by members of the regular college faculty. ‘This class is 
under the general direction of Prof. Harry B. Smith. 
TEACHERS COLLEGE, NEW YORK CITY. 
A class was conducted in 1913-14 at Teachers College, Columbia University, New 
York, N. Y., on Friday evenings, 7.30 to 9.30, for 25 sessions. The director of indus- 
trial arts education had administrative charge of the class, and devoted 10 periods of 
the 25 to a study of the principles of teaching, observation, and discussion of obser- 
vation lessons given in a woodworking shop, discussion of the problems of vocational 
education, and special study of the industrial education problems of the fields repre- 
sented by the members of the class. This part of the course was followed by Profs. 
Noyes, Sleffel, and Weick, who took up intensively the problems of teaching wood-

PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 245 
work, metal work, and industrial drawing, respectively. Membership in the class 
was not restricted to tradesmen, but included a few teachers of industrial arts from 
local schools. 
In 1914-15 it is planned to restrict the attendance to men of journeyman standing, 
between the ages of 24 and 45, who give promise of success as teachers. The class will 
be limited to 20. There will be two sessions weekly for 25 weeks, Tuesdays and Thurs- 
days from 7.30 to 9.30, a total of 100 hours. In addition to instruction, class lectures, 
and discussion, opportunities for practice teaching in evening vocational schools will 
be provided through the cooperation of the board of education. Mr. Joseph H. 
Constantine is in charge of the practice teaching and of administrative details, with 
assistance of department representatives as in 1913-14. 
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
The University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., has been actively engaged in the 
work of training teachers for vocational schools since September, 1910, at which date 
Prof. Fred D. Crawshaw was elected director of the department of manual arts. Dur- 
ing the four years three plans have been developed to prepare mechanics for teaching: 
1. Class for adult special students.—Journeymen mechanics having the necessary 
qualifications are encouraged to register in the university as “Adult specials.”? Two 
annual scholarships, of the value of $400 each, are provided for this purpose. Special 
courses are offered for men of this type. 3 
2. Mechanics institute.—The board of regents appointed 15 industrial scholars to 
spend one month at the university, March 9 to April 9, 1914. These 15 men were 
selected from a list of applicants recommended by prominent local residents, and 
represented 11 cities in different parts of Wisconsin and 12 different trades. The 
purpose of the institute was to give intensive practice in special lines of shopwork 
and drawing, and some consideration of the problems of teaching, organization, and 
administration. Provision was made for observation of model lessons, and for dis- 
cussion and criticism. 
No one responsible for the organization of the institute believes that one month is 
a satisfactory length of time in which to train men professionally for teaching. It is 
believed, however, that two ends may be accomplished in this time: First, the 
members of the institute will gain some power to organize material in their own field 
of endeavor, and will receive some specific instruction and practice in teaching classes; 
and second, they will acquire some appreciation of the teaching problem for particu- 
lar types of school, and should, consequently, be able either to decide to seek further 
preparation or to abandon the idea of teaching. 
3. Continuation school for trades teachers.—In 1911 the extension division of the 
TEL organized a three-year night-school course for the training of teachers for 
industrial schools, under the general direction of the department of manual aris. 
The program of work includes the following subjects: Y Shop practice, 5 hours per 
week (3 years, 36 weeks per year) in one or more trades, in the Milwaukee Trades 
School or in the factories; (2) English, with special reference to the needs of indus- 
trial teachers, 2 years, 72 lessons; (3) mathematics, as used in shop and drafting 
room, with emphasis upon teaching the subject in industrial schools, 3 years, 108 
lessons; (4) mechanical drawing, 3 years, 216 hours; (5) methods of teaching, 1 year, 
36 lessons; (6) industrial education, | year, 36 lessons; (7) civics, 1 year, 36 lessons; 
(8) sanitation and safety devices, 1 year, 36 lessons; (9) class teaching, criticisms, and 
discussion, 1 year, 36 lessons; (10) elective study, 1 year, 36 lessons. 
This course is to be put upon a better working basis by the appointment of a resi- 
dent director to give his entire time to its further development. Beginning with 
1914-15 the course will be under the direction of Mr. Wilson H. Henderson, assistant 
professor of manual arts. 
CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PA, 
Since 1911 the school of applied industries of the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
has been offering a course for the training of teachers in the field of industrial educa- 
tion. It is adapted primarily for high-school graduates, especially from the manual
-P-A-G-E-284
246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
training and industrial high schools. It covers a four-year course of study leading to 
the degree of bachelor of science in industrial education. The school awarded its 
first degrees in this department in June, 1914, to graduates who entered with ad- 
vanced standing. 
In addition to the regular course of four years for high-school graduates, a two-year 
teachers’ short course, and a special night and Saturday morning course, are offered. 
The work is thus arranged to supplement the academic training of graduates of nor- 
mal schools or colleges by giving practical instruction as a helpful background for 
principle and theory. To the man of more mature years who has acquired some 
skill in his trade and wishes to prepare himself for teaching, a thorough working 
knowledge of the ‘‘mechanics of teaching” is given. For men who are already in 
the teaching profession, but feel the need of a better theoretical or practical basis for 
their chosen work, the night and Saturday morning course meets the need. A num- 
ber of graduates of the short course and of the special course are making good as 
teachers in various parts of the country. 
Methods of instruction.—The department of industrial teachers’ training of the 
: Carnegie Institute of Technology aims to train its teachers to fill positions in appren- 
tice shops, in manual training schools—both grammar and high schools—in prevoca- 
tional schools, and in trade schools. In the instruction offered the emphasis is put 
| upon shopwork as the important groundwork of the course. The list of school shops 
. and laboratories includes machine, pattern, foundry, forge, plumbing, bricklaying, 
electrical, carpentry, sheet metal, manual arts, printing, mechanical and structural 
drawing rooms, and laboratories for chemistry and physics. 
Closely interrelated with the shop practice is the work of the department of prac- 
tical sciences, which includes the technical subjects utilizing the application of 
mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and the instruction given under the heading 
of general studies, including English composition and literature; history—political, 
social, and industrial; industrial geography; civics and economics. The whole is 
complemented by a careful study of the principles of educational psychology and 
; pedagogy, upon which the science of teaching is based. The latter makes provision 
. for a general knowledge of psychology—the psychology of the child and adolescent, 
. educational psychology, social psychology, social education, industrial education, 
school supervision and administration, school hygiene and sanitation, history of 
| modern education, classroom management, practical teaching, and teaching obser- 
vation, In addition to the equipment, the school is so situated that it can cooperate 
| with other agencies to give the student adequate experience through actual partici- 
.   
pation, as a teacher, in the work. 
Trade cooperation.—A close relationship exists between the various manufacturers 
of the city of Pittsburgh and the school of applied industries, which, of course, has its 
effect upon the teachers’ training work. Ideas are interchanged and the cooperation 
goes to the extent of appointing committees to advise in the working out of the cur- 
riculum. A notable recent example, on a larger scale than ever before in connection 
with any industry, is the national recognition that has come from one of the largest 
bodies of manufacturers in the United States. An agreement has been made whereby 
the United Typothete and Franklin Clubs of America, and their committee on 
apprentices, recognize the printing department of the school as the official technical 
school for the typothete. This will mean much from the cooperative standpoint. 
Candidates for admission to the regular teachers’ course must be able to qualify 
under two tests: (1) Personal interview with the dean and the head of the depart- 
ment; (2) presentation of a certificate of graduation from a satisfactory four-years 
course of study in an approved high or preparatory school, or its equivalent in prac- 
tical training or experience. Applicants seeking admission to short courses, not 
leading to a degree, must be men of maturity and must give evidence of experience 
in practical work requiring manual skill by presenting satisfactory statements from
-P-A-G-E-285
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 247 
present and past employers, certifying as to character, ability, nature of work, and 
length of service. They musi also present themselves for a personal interview with 
the dean and the head of the department. 
For the present it is the aim of the department to limit the number of candidates 
in the entering class to 24 students pursuing the regular four-years course. 
‘The work of the industrial teachers’ course is in direct charge of the head of the 
department, Dr. Walter Libby, who cooperates with the dean of the School of Applied 
Industries and the other heads of departments with which the training of teachers is 
necessarily interrelated. 
Training women teachers.—Provision is also made for the training of women as 
teachers of vocational subjects. This course is similar in many respects to the industrial 
teachers’ course for men. . It is offered in the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology. The courses as outlined include: (1) Household 
economics (domestic science); (2) secretarial (commercial); (3) costume economics 
(domestic art); (4) home arts and crafts (handicrafts); (5) general science. 
BRADLEY POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
Bradley Polytechnic Institute, Peoria, Ill., has begun to train teachers for schools 
that are strictly vocational in character. It has come to the vocational field through 
an effort to meet the changing demands for efficient teachers of the manual aris for 
grammar, prevocational, and high schools. These demands have led over into the 
realm of the vocational school. The institute still holds to its academic standard 
of high-school graduation, or equivalent, plus two years of special training in the 
manual arts, pedagogy, and English, before any diploma is given; and two additional 
years of general college work in science, mathematics, language, and history, before 
the bachelor’s degree is given. However, young mechanics with little or no high- 
school preparation, but with alert minds and some evening or correspondence school 
work, are admitted to regular classes and given full credit for their work, not being 
allowed to graduate till all high-school requirements have been met in some satis- 
factory way. 
Changing demands.—The demand upon this school for teachers of the manual arts 
during the past two years has been stronger than ever before, and a noticeable fact 
about that demand is that a much greater variety of teachers and supervisors is wanted. 
Besides the usual teachers of woodworking, pattern making, forging, machine shop, 
etc., there are requests for practical electricians, printers, men to teach the running 
and care of gasoline engines and automobiles, teachers of continuation school subjects, 
directors of continuation and vocational schools, men to teach the drawing of plans 
for farm buildings, teachers of agriculture and woodworking or blacksmithing, or both, 
suited to farm communities. From these requests it is clear that the demand for men 
of practical experience is growing stronger; but there is little or no willingness to take 
teachers with lower academic standard. Bradley Institute is attempting to meet 
these new demands in two ways: (1) By attracting to its courses men with trade ex- 
perience; (2) by running a factory within the school, which gives practical experi- 
ence in a few of the kinds of work in greatest demand. 
The following record of the 80 students who have been pursuing the courses for 
teachers during the two years 1912-13 and 1913-14 (not including summer-school 
students) indicates the sources of men students in the courses for teachers: 
12 with full trade preparation, 
16 with partial trade preparation, 
6 directly from teaching, 
10 from technical high schools, 
2 from art schools, 
34 from other high schools and normal schools.

-P-A-G-E-286
248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The equipment includes seven shops, two of which are run on a factory basis, organ- 
ized with a modern cost system, with expert mechanics as instructors, and turning 
out a valuable product. The records show that during the year 1912-13, September 
to September, the products manufactured were valued at $2,172.13. A large part of 
this was machinery and equipment for the use of the institute, outside sales amount- 
ing to only $270.35. The year 1913-14 will probably show an increase on these : 
amounts. Only by having a product of considerable volume passing through the shop 
can the methods of doing work used in a commercial shop be carried on in a school 
shop, and only by having some means of disposing of this product at a fair price can 
any school afford to maintain such a factory shop. The contention is that this kind 
of shop has all of the essential educative elements of a commercial shop and none of its 
abuses. Skill, as well as a knowledge of principles and processes, is gained in a shorter 
time. 
Prof. Charles A. Bennett, as director of the department of manual arts, has adminis- 
trative charge of the courses for the training of teachers. 
PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS, NASHVILLE, TENN. 
The George Peabody College for Teachers is just now in the process of organization, 
having opened its doors for the first time with the summer session of 1914. Numerous 
inquiries have been received for teachers who are thoroughly trained in some vocation 
and who are prepared to teach it. The demand thus far has been chiefly for teachers 
of the building trades, machine trades, printing, and drafting. 
The present plans include provision for the training of teachers in carpentry, ma- 
chine woodworking, machine shop, printing, and drafting. Students in the special 
teacher-training classes will be expected to spend at least one-third of their time while 
in the college in technical training in the subject of specialization, and to spend ap- 
proximately three months of the year in actual work in the industry. It is expected 
that positions for students will be found which will enable them to fulfill the require- 
ment with respect to the time employed in the industry. Prof. Robert W. Selvidge 
is in administrative charge of the department. 
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. 
The department of education of the University of Chicago is interested in the work 
of preparing teachers for all phases of education, but so far as industrial education is 
concerned, it is placing emphasis on the administrative side; that is, the effort ismade 
to develop in superintendents, principals, and teachers an intelligent interest in the 
whole field of vocational education, as well as accurate information regarding sound 
principles and practices in the several types of schools in various parts of the country. 
This work does not necessarily involve technical training. 
Methods.—Each student is encouraged to take such courses as the university affords 
that will give him the training of which he is in the most immediate need. The de- 
mand for teachers and directors is so strong, however, that most teachers go into the 
work only partially prepared. These are encouraged to return year by year for addi- 
tional training and inspiration, and many respond. During the summer quarter, the 
period of heaviest attendance of this group, a special industrial class is conducted for 
observation and demonstration purposes. The class is made up of sixth and seventh 
grade boys, 14 years of age orover. The class is in the hands of four or five different 
specialists, and individual students are given opportunities to assist in the instruction 
and management in various ways. 
The courses are under the general direction of Prof. Frank M. Leavitt. 
OHIO STATE NORMAL COLLEGE, OXFORD, OHIO, 
The Ohio State Normal College, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, has been training 
manual arts teachers for the past six years, and many of the graduates of the manual 
 
-P-A-G-E-287

arts department have been drawn into the work of organizing and teaching industrial 
classes. But the department does not claim to be training teachers for vocational 
education. Itis believed that until such time as adequate facilities can be provided 
for training teachers specifically for industrial education, the men and women who 
have been trained for the work in manual arts must be depended upon to supply the 
demand. 
Methods.—The aim has been to prepare teachers for manual-arts work in the smaller 
school systems. Special emphasis is placed on woodworking, the correlated design, 
and mechanical drawing. There are also courses in metal work and pottery. 
Each course is treated under four heads: (1) Design, (2) working drawing, (3) con- 
struction, and usually (4) related shop mathematics. The courses are under the 
general direction of Prof. Fred C. Whitcomb. 
UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI. 
The University of Missouri, at Columbia, Mo., has prepared plans for dealing with 
the problem of training teachers for vocational schools, which are held in abeyance 
for the present for administrative reasons. The department of manual arts, in the 
school of education, under the direction of Prof. Ira S. Griffith, will be equipped in 
due time to handle this work. 
3, INVESTIGATIONS AND SURVEYS. 
In the corresponding chapter in the Report of the Commissioner 
of Education for 1913, one section was devoted to discussion of 
special investigations that had been completed, or were under way 
or projected, in a number of cities. This method of community 
study for the purpose of securing definite knowledge of conditions 
upon which to base an industrial education program was charac- 
terized as the most significant phase of the vocational education 
movement during the year 1912-13. The work of investigation con- 
tinues with unabated vigor, and 1913-14 has been signalized by 
several important contributions. Space is here given to brief reports 
from only a few of the cities in which surveys are yielding practical 
and definite results. 
NEW YORK, N. Y. 
The department of education is now conducting three industrial surveys 
with a view to the establishment of continuation instruction in cooperation with 
business establishments. These include a survey of Staten Island, where there are 
many extensive industrial establishments, a survey of Astoria, and one in the city 
at large with special reference to the extension of technical high-school activities. 
The chamber of commerce and the merchants’ association have both entered into 
a scheme of cooperation with the board of education. The former body has under- 
taken to supply on schedule a number of leaders in the commercial world who will 
lecture to students in the commercial schools and classes. It has also given favora- 
ble consideration to a plan for distributing such students in great offices, as a means 
of education for undergraduates. The merchants’ association has agreed to find a 
room in which office workers in the Woolworth Building may receive extra instruction. 
During the month of May a commission, made up of the mayor and other city officers, 
the president and some members.of the board of education, as well as officers of the 
board, together with representatives of the business, journalistic, and educational 
world, and other public men, made a tour of inspection to observe methods of voca- 
tional education in Cincinnati, Chicago, and Gary, Ind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Following this visit a public meeting of 1,600 people interested in vocational edu- 
cation was held, at which addresses were made by the president of the board of edu- 
cation, the mayor, and comptroller of the city, Dr. Gustav Straubenmiiller, of the 
board of education, Mr. H. E. Miles, of Milwaukee, and Supt. William Wirt, of 
Gary, Ind. A special study of industrial education has since been undertaken. 
NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
The survey referred to in this chapter, in the 1913 report, has been prosecuted 
vigorously during the year, under the leadership of Dr. David Spence Hill, director 
of the division of educational research of the public school department. During the 
year studies have been made of special schools in various parts of the country, with 
a view to determining what features give most promise of success in local conditions. 
Bulletins.—The division of educational research has in preparation a series of bul- 
letins setting forth the results of the year’s investigations. The first of these, entitled 
“Facts about the Public Schools of New Orleans in Relation to Vocation,’’ was pub- 
lished in June, 1914. This report contains preliminary information concerning a 
number of administrative problems in the elementary schools, such as progress of 
pupils, elimination, and a number of statistical analyses, and also studies of the 
industrial distribution of fathers, teachers’ impressions of boys’ aptitudes for trade 
work, boys and men in night schools, former jobs and present ambitions, and present 
occupational distribution of boys in night schools. 
The second bulletin will summarize the information which has been gathered 
concerning the industries of New Orleans. Over 90 factories and other places of 
employment have been visited, and additional plants were investigated by means 
of correspondence. The third bulletin will present a report on the buildings, 
equipment, and organization of nine typical schools in other cities, which were visited 
and studied during the year. 
From the data collected in these three reports it is proposed to deduce plans for 
curricula, teaching staff, administration, site, buildings, and equipment for a school 
that shall in some measure be adapted to conditions in New Orleans. 
CHICAGO, ILL. 
In Chicago the superintendent of public schools ‘‘concluded that great benefit 
would be derived in a system if the teachers, those who are directly associated with 
the children and youth, could first make such a study, if only of one line of instrue- 
tion or effort.’’ Without waiting for suggestion or pressure from the outside, therefore, a 
plan for a comprehensive study of the schools was perfected. 
A committee consisting of 320 members, one representative from each school in 
the system, was organized in the form of 25 subcommittees. Each subcommittee 
was assigned to a particular phase of work; as, the school plant, administration, child 
study, and others. Each school in the system was visited by at least one subcom- 
mittee. Each subcommittee presented a written report, and these were published 
in full in the annual report of the superintendent to the board of education for the 
year ending June 30, 1914. The point of view is suggested, partially at least, by the 
following paragraph quoted from a circular letter addressed to teachers and principals 
by the superintendent: 
Should there come later a survey conducted by inspectors from the outside, we 
shall have our own survey with which to judge their results. We also shall have gone 
through the first palpitations and excitement caused by a cooperative investigation. 
The reports of a number of the subcommittees are of special interest to the reader of 
this chapter, but it is possible to refer to only four, as follows: 
Industrial and prevocational education.—The committee criticizes as misleading and 
ill-advised the use of the terms “‘industrial,’’ “vocational,’’ and ‘“prevocational’’ in
-P-A-G-E-289
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 251 
connection with the courses now offered under these designations. It is believed 
that the fundamental purpose in elementary education is the “development in the 
child of those attitudes and reactions essential to social well-being in a democratic 
society,”’ and, further, that the vocational purposes of the different forms of hand- 
work in the elementary school are only secondary. 
In connection with the industrial schools the committee strongly recommends the 
introduction of a greater variety of handwork, with the employment of two teachers 
of handwork in each school, the revision of the present course of study, and the modi- 
fication of the present plan of building in order to provide adequate accommodation 
for the handwork. 
The committee also recommends that vocational schools be organized to take the 
place of the present scheme of prevocational classes in the high schools, and to provide 
vocational courses of various types for boys and girls 14 years of age or over, in the 
seventh and eighth grades. It is proposed that these schools be equipped as technical 
industrial or trade schools. 
The recommendations of the committee include definite suggestions as to organiza- 
tion of schools and classes, courses of study, equipment, and teaching staff. 
Vocational work in high schools.—The report discusses the work done under the fol- 
lowing divisions: Woodworking, metalworking, electrical work, sewing, kitchens 
and laundries, printing, apprentice classes. Among the good features pointed out 
are: The splendid opportunities for individual expression in the planning and work- 
ing out of problems that are worth while; valuable training in work on group prob- 
lems; opportunity for following the individual bent, and developing special abilities. 
The suggestions for improvement include: A systematic arrangement for teachers’ 
conferences; more cooperation between departments; use of commercial department 
to mimeograph lecture notes and demonstration outlines for students’ notebooks; 
possibility of finding useful problems in the school, home, and elsewhere. 
Vocational guidance.—The committee takes the position that vocational guidance 
must neither favor nor disfavor any class of occupations, but should surround the 
child with all possible information or opportunities to secure information, and then 
stimulate him to a wise decision for which he himself assumes the responsibility, 
The training provided must not be narrow; geography, civics, economics, and the 
other studies should teach the “history of industry, the social significance of com- 
merce and the newer vocations connected with public utilities and social service. 
The early training must be broad, but not superficial; the later training intensive, 
but not narrowing.’’ 
The report contains specific suggestions of ways by which the work in vocational 
guidance may be extended and improved. 
Plan for organization of a bureau of vocational guidance.—The committee which pre- 
pared this report recognizes three distinct functions in vocational guidance: (1) 
Study and training of the child in school; (2) study of the industries of the commu- 
nity; (3) a placement bureau. 
The committee recommends the coordination of all the present more or less indi- 
vidual and disorganized activities under a capable director with assistants. An out- 
line is given of the work to be undertaken by the director and of the duties of the 
vocational advisers. 
BUFFALO, N. Y. 
The committee on vocational guidance of the Buffalo Chamber of Commerce has 
been active in the development of plans for dealing with local problems. The com- 
mittee has recognized the necessity for a thorough preliminary analysis of the situa- 
tion, in order to determine the needs of children, parents, schools, and industries, 
This has been found to be a far larger and more difficult task than was at first realized, 
hence much time is still being devoted to this important feature of the work. 
   
-P-A-G-E-290
    252 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
In order to secure first-hand information on what is being accomplished in other 
communities, Mr. Charles Rchlfs, a member of the committee, visited schools in 
Wisconsin, Ilinois, Indiana, Ohio, and the District of Columbia. His report is under 
consideration by the committee in the effort to determine the direction of the next 
steps. The entire project is proceeding, purposely, upon a very conservative basis. 
GRAND RAPIDS, MICH. 
As the result of the survey referred to in this chapter last year, as well as other 
causes, commendable progress has been made. A school of printing is being developed, 
in which a number of apprentices are attending continuation classes. A number of 
day pupils are preparing to become printers. 
The work in vocational guidance has attracted much attention from school men, 
This work begins in the seventh grade, and is carried on systematically from this 
point through the high school in connection with the work in English. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION SURVEY, NEW YORK, N. Y. 
In June, 1914, a report on the proposed vocational education survey was submitted 
to a committee of the board of education by the director, Mrs. Alice Barrows Fer- 
nandez. The primary purpose of the survey is to study the problem of the prevoca- 
tional training of all 14 to 16 years old children in the schools, It is believed that this 
is at once the most pressing and the most difficult problem in the field of vocational 
education. ‘It is evident that to prepare children under 16 for subdivided processes 
of work or special parts of a trade is neither educational for the children, financially 
practicable for the schools, nor ultimately for the best interests of the workers or of 
industry.” 
The solution proposed by the survey is to perfect a plan for developing in children 
industrial intelligence and practical adaptability, for training workers who shall be 
continually and progressively efficient, by laying the foundations of the training in 
the fundamental principles that are common to many trades. For this purpose a 
careful analysis of the actual processes in a number of selected industries is projected, 
to determine what are the fundamental principles common to the various types of 
industrial work, together with their variations according to different products. 
Plan of the survey.—The plan of the survey for the ensuing two years is to study and 
collect facts about the metal trades, which include 41 different industries. There are 
three main lines of attack upon the problem: (1) A statistical inquiry to ascertain 
the distribution of the 100,000 employees according to the several types of hand and 
machine work, and the characteristics of each class of work; (2) analysis of the ma- 
chines and processes in order to determine the fundamental principles which are 
common to the machines and processes of varying types, with a view to determining 
how these principles can be taught to children under 16 years of age in such a way as 
_to promote adaptability to such special lines of work as may be entered upon after 
leaving school; (3) an experiment in prevocational training in one of the public 
elementary schools, in order to test out the findings and conclusions of the survey as 
the work proceeds. 
THE RICHMOND INDUSTRIAL SURVEY, RICHMOND, VA. 
Beginning about the Ist of May, 1914, Richmond has been making a survey of its 
schools and industries for the purpose of formulating plans for industrial education. 
A representative of the Bureau of Education has served as a member of the commis- 
sion in charge of the survey. 
The school board has taken the initiative in making the investigation, supported 
by the Richmond Chamber of Commerce, the Business Men’s Club, the Rotary Club, 
the trustees of the Virginia Mechanics Institute, the central trades and labor council,
-P-A-G-E-291
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 258 
the metal trades council, and other local organizations. From the outside, expert 
advice and assistance has been rendered by the National Society for the Promotion of 
Industrial Education, as noted elsewhere in this chapter. 
The total number of persons employed in the work of the survey was about 25, 
with a maximum force engaged at any one time of 13. The work lasted from the 
first of Mey to about the middle of October. 
THE ILLINOIS SCHOOL SURVEY, 
One of the fields of investigation by the Hlinois State school survey, whose general 
director is Dr. L. D. Coffman, of the University of Illinois, is that of vocational edu- 
cation. This division of the survey is being conducted by Dr. Charles Hughes John- 
ston, professor of secondary education, University of Illinois. The five divisions of 
this branch, of the survey are concerned respectively with the following questions: 
First, the extent to which curriculums in small high schools are being differentiated 
on a vocational basis; second, the attitudes of several thousand typical parents of 
high-school children toward definite proposals to provide vocational education and 
a system of vocational guidance; third, a thoroughgoing analysis of the vocational 
intentions, earnings, influences on career choosing, and kindred problems of 8,000 
high-school boys and girls (data secured by personal visits to Illinois schools); fourth, 
a tabulation of attitudes of business men who employ high-school graduates of 
commercial curriculums toward definite developments, extensions, and curriculum 
differentiations of high-school commercial education; and, fifth, a study of the 
requirements of vocational education and training in typical trades and crafts of 
Illinois. 
The results of this division of the State school survey, when tabulated and inter- 
preted, are to be put at the disposal of the legislative committee of the State teachers’ 
association, together with a study of those features of recent State legislation for 
vocational education likely to be of local interest or application. 
4. STATE SYSTEMS OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
Six States now have in operation definite systems for organizing 
and supervising vocational schools and for assisting local communi- 
ties in the maintenance of such schools through grants of State aid. 
Specific machinery for the administration of these systems has been 
established, in each case under the direction of a special deputy, or 
expert assistant, attached to the staff of the State superintendent or 
commissioner of education. These States are Massachusetts, New 
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Indiana. 
In addition to these States, Connecticut has established a plan for 
maintaining, or assisting in the maintenance, of industrial schools 
under certain conditions, the administration being carried on through 
the office of the secretary of the State board of education. California 
has begun the organization of a division of vocational education in 
the office of the State superintendent of public instruction, by the 
appointment of a commissioner of vocational education. No provi- 
sion has been made for State aid for local schools. 
A list of the members of the divisions of vocational education in 
the State departments of public instruction follows:

PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 255 
The following summary, based on reports received from the offices 
of the State departments of public instruction, is a brief review of 
the progress that has been made during the past year in the admin- 
istration of State aid for industrial education. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Legislation.—Chapter 391, Acts of 1914, authorizes the State board of education to 
provide and maintain classes for the training of teachers for State-aided vocational 
and continuation schools. Training classes will be supervised by an agent of the 
board of education, who will cooperate with local school authorities. in establishing 
and conducting teacher-training classes in connection with evening industrial schools. 
The expense incurred in conducting these classes will be defrayed entirely by the 
State. An initial appropriation of $2,500 for this purpose is available for 1914~15. 
Chapter 174, Acts of 1914, authorizes any city, town, or district composed of cities 
and towns, with the approval of the State board of education, to provide classes for 
the training of teachers for vocational schools. State supervision of such training 
classes is obligatory. A community maintaining approved classes is reimbursed by 
the State to the extent of one-half the cost of maintenance. 
Other acts have been passed, relating to certificates for minors, financing and 
equipping industrial schools, the encouragement of agriculture among children and 
youth, and other purposes. 
Types of school.—The types of State-aided vocational school organized under the 
Massachusetts law include: (1) Full-time day school; (2) full-time cooperative day 
school; (3) part-time school; (4) continuation school; (5) evening school. These 
schools offer the following courses: (1) Trade preparatory courses, for boys and girls; 
(2) trade extension courses, for men and women; (3) homemaking courses, for girls; 
(4) agricultural courses in separate schools and departments in high schools, for boys 
and girls. ; 
Bulletins.—The following bulletins relating to vocational education have been 
issued: 
No. 21. State-aided Vocational Education. 
No. 25. State-Aided Vocational Agricultural Education in 1912. 
No. 27. Educational Legislation of 1913. 
No. 31. (1) Massachusetis State-Aided Vocational Education. 
(2) Proposals for the Training of Teachers for Vocational Education. 
No. 32. State-Aided Vocational Agricultural Education in 1913. 
No. 34. Directory of State-Aided Vocational Schools. 
New work.—The work of organizing the continuation schools under chapter 805 of 
the Acts of 1918, has been nearly completed. Continuation schools will be started 
in Boston in September, 1914. For description of the law see the last report.! The 
purpose of the part-time, or continuation, school is to extend in some measure, until 
the age of 16, the education of boys and girls who enter wage-earning callings at the 
completion of the period of compulsory schooling. The immediate aims of contin- 
uation schools are, first, to train their pupils for good citizenship and to advance their 
general culture, and, secondly, to promote vocational efficiency by courses related 
to the pupil’s practical experience in a trade. 
It is probable that continuation schools in most cases will be of the first class, 
namely, general improvement schools, which enable minors between 14 and 16 to 
prolong their general education and also to discover their special aptitudes. This 
broad training, including a knowledge of industries and the development of indus- 
trial sense, is to be followed by special instruction preparatory to entrance on a skilled 
calling.

  256 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
During the year definite progress has been made in organizing short unit courses in 
trade instruction in evening classes. The so-called “unit” course is planned to meet 
the needs of workers already engaged in a trade. Instruction in a “unit” course 
gives the pupil, during the time at his command, the material he most requires, pre- 
sented in a manner most likely to benefit the learner. A full account of such unit 
courses will be issued by the department of vocational education of the board cf 
education at an early date. 
Teachers’ training.—Under authority of the legislation in chapters 391 and 174, 
Acts of 1914, the State will provide means for training teachers for vocational and 
continuation schools in cooperation with communities maintaining them. It will 
insure State supervision of this training, and enable the community maintaining 
approved classes to secure reimbursement to the extent of one-half the expenditures 
for maintenance. There is at present no agency engaged in this work, and there is 
no supply of teachers, 
At the present time, plans are underway to establish evening classes and assist- 
antships in the larger industrial schools of the State, notably those in Boston, Wor- 
cester, Springfield, Lowell, and New Bedford. Possibly good opportunities will be 
found also in other communities. In each of the centers named there are at the 
present time not only well-developed and efficient industrial schools, but many 
large industries exist from which suitably equipped apprentices may be expected to 
come. In the course of a few years it is hoped that graduates of these industrial 
schools, having had some practical experience, will return and undertake to qualify 
themselves as teachers. 
For purposes of instruction, it is intended to utilize, where practicable, the build- 
ings and equipment of existing industrial schools, and also the services, in part, of 
members of the teaching staff. The courses established will be designated not merely 
for persons seeking to become teachers, but also for persons now serving as teachers, 
who desire further instruction for their work. 
For the present it is contemplated that the evening course proposed shall be carried 
on for the same length of time each year as regular evening school industrial courses, 
namely, two sessions every week for 20 weeks, each session being about two hours in 
length. It now seems probable, in view of the character of the demands for efficient 
service made upon teachers in vocational schools, that young persons after having 
taken the evening courses referred to above, will, in the majority of instances, first 
receive employment as shop assistants in industrial departments. For a period there- 
after these teachers would still be serving, as it were, an apprenticeship in teaching, 
under such conditions that the director of the school and the head of the particular 
department will carefully supervise the work of the instructor and train him along 
needed lines. i7=.: = 
Teachers’ conferences.—At Hyannis, from June 29 to July 1, 1914, inclusive, there 
was held the regular summer institute for the benefit of teachers employed in the 
State-aided vocational schools. Important problems confronting the various schools 
were frankly discussed. The meetings were attended by 150 persons, This meet- 
ing, as anticipated, gave fully as much satisfaction as that of the previous year. 
Since January 1, 1914, Mrs. Eva W. White, agent in charge of industrial home- 
making and practical arts training for women and girls, has conducted weekly con- 
ferences with groups of teachers to discuss the various problems as they appear. These 
~ conferences have greatly aided the work of the instructors. 
Cooperation with industry —The Independent Industrial School at Beverly is oper- 
ated as an all-day school, under a cooperative agreement with the United Shoe 
Machinery Co. Instruction is given in machine-shop work, and related drawing, 
mathematics, science, and English. Two divisions of boys alternate weekly between 
| the schoolroom and the factory of the United Shoe Machinery Co. The hours are:
-P-A-G-E-295
  
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 257 
Factory—7 to 12, 1 to 5, except Saturday afternoon; school—8 to 12, 2 to 4, except 
Saturday. The school year is 50 weeks; legal holidays are observed; average length 
of course, 30 months. 
The school opened August 2, 1909, under an independent board of trustees, repre- 
senting the city school committee, the company, and the city. The school at present 
has 5 teachers and 60 boys in the part-time classes, while 7 boys are on full time in the 
factory, not yet released from the school. The boys in the factory are on commercial 
work and receive as wages one-half the piece price paid to regular mechanics. There 
are 35 graduates of the school. 
The Industrial School at Quincy operates an all-day school, and offers instruction in 
the following departments: (1) Machine-shop work in the shops of the Fore River 
Shipbuilding Co. and the Boston Gear Works; (2) sheet metalwork, coppersmithing, 
joinery, mold loft work, and plumbing in the shops of the Fore River Shipbuilding Co.; 
(3) telephone construction and maintenance in the shops of the Couch Telephone Co. 
In addition to the shopwork given in these departments, related work is also given in 
shop drawing, shop mathematics, English, civics, geography, materials of trade, and 
industrial history. 
The school is in session from 8.15 to 2.30 daily except Saturdays. The school year 
begins the middle of September and closes the first week in July. The vacations 
take place during Christmas week, one week in April, and all legal holidays. The 
length of the course is three years. The number of teachers giving instruction at 
present is 2, and the total number of pupils enrolled is 60. 
The Quincy Industrial School also operates a part-time school, in which is offered 
instruction in the following departments: Machine construction and gear construction. 
The school is in session from 2.30 to 4.30 on Saturday afternoons. The school year 
begins the middle of September and closes the last week in June. The length of 
the course is three years. This school is supported by an annual appropriation made by 
the city council. It is housed in the same building with the Quincy full-time cooper- 
ative school. One teacher’s time is devoted to the instruction, and the total number 
of pupils enrolled is 10. 
The Boys’ Trade School in Worcester operates an all-day cooperative school, and also 
a part-time school, offering instruction in the following departments: Machine-shop 
work in the shops of the Heald Machine Co. and the Morgan Construction Co.; power 
plant engineering, patternmaking, cabinetmaking, house carpentry, and printing. 
Related work is also given in mathematics, science, English, drawing, industrial his- 
tory, bookkeeping, cost accounts, civics, commercial arithmetic, and commercial 
geography. 
The school was established under an ordinance passed in January, 1909, and one 
passed in January, 1910. The school opened in October, 1910. The instruction is 
given in the building occupied by the Worcester full-time day school. The students 
in the cooperative school receive their instruction at the same time as those in the 
full-time day school, and eight teachers devote part of their time to the work. 
The part-time school is in session from 8 to 12 on Saturday mornings. The school 
year begins the first week in September and closes the middle of August. The vaca- 
tions take place during Christmas week, Fourth of July week, and the last two weeks 
in August. The length of the course is four years. 
The school was established under an ordinance passed in January, 1909, and one 
passed in January, 1910. The school opened in October, 1910. The instruction is 
given in the building occupied by the full-time day school, and at the same time as 
those classes on Saturday mornings. The board of control is an independent board of 
trustees. The partial time of 8 teachers is given to the instruction of these students, 
and the number of pupils enrolled is 17.

  258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
NEW YORK. 
New legislation —The education law was amended by providing for the extension to 
rural communities of the facilities for high-school education, including agriculture. 
This amendment empowers and authorizes the commissioner of education to lay out in 
any territory, exclusive of city school districts, central schools to give instruction 
usually given in the common schools and in the high school. This is a form of con- 
solidation in which the consolidated districts are authorized to maintain a central 
school district, and they are encouraged to establish within the central school courses 
in agriculture and homemaking. 
Types of school.—Five types of school have been organized under the education law: 
(1) The general industrial school; (2) trade schools; (3) schools of agriculture, 
mechanic arts, and homemaking; (4) part-time or continuation schools; (5) evening 
vocational schools. 
Bulletins: The following bulletins have been issued during the past year: 
Bulletin 542. “Vocational Schools.’ 
Bulletin 543. ‘‘Schools of Agriculture, Mechanic Arts, and Homemaking.” 
Bulletin 563, ‘‘Agriculture in the High School.” 
Bulletin 566, ‘‘Vocational Schools,” reprint from the Annual Report of the 
Commissioner of Education. 
Bulletin 569, ‘‘A List of Helpful Publications Concerning Vocational Instruction.”” 
Syllabus in Drawing for Secondary Schools. 
An experiment in continuation-school work.—An experimental continuation trade class 
was opened in Public School No. 4, New York City. The work covered a period of 
10 weeks, and the class was composed of 16 white-goods workers, 4 young workers 
being selected from each of four prominent business establishments. The girls 
attended the class on alternate weeks in groups of 8. A written report stating 
absences and character of work was submitted to the employer on Friday afternoon. 
The wage for the week was based upon this report, deduction being made for absence 
asin the shop. The hours were from 8.30a. m. to5 p.m., with one-half hour intermis- 
sion for luncheon. 
From 8.30 to 12.30 the program was as follows: Trade arithmetic, spelling, English 
to foreigners, business-letter writing, trade geography, hygiene for the worker, 
special corrective gymnastics, civics based upon the need of an intelligent under- 
standing of the relations of the members of a trade to one another and to the State, 
ethics, preparation of noon lunch, elementary study of food and its relation to health 
and efficiency. The program from 2 to 5 o’clock wasas follows: Study of the mechan- 
ism of a foot-power machine, how to run it and how to keep it in order; elementary 
study of textiles (cotton goods); making of whole garment with emphasis upon the gen- 
eral setting of each girl’s particular (shop) process to whole of the industry. The 
instructors were a regular teacher in the school, a special teacher of domestic science, 
and a graduate of Pratt Institute, who taught textiles. 
Each worker made from 2 to 8 garments. The total output was 65 whole garments.* 
Classes in salesmanship and classes in elementary education have been developed 
in various department stores in New York City and Buffalo. 
State conferences.—Next to the problem of securing teachers who are prepared to 
undertake the work of vocational instruction is that of keeping those teachers who are 
already engaged in the work abreast of that which is being done by other teachers. 
With this in view, during the past year the specialists within the division have con- 
ducted, in different sections of the State, conferences which have been attended 
by the teachers, principals, and supervisors who were actively engaged in vocational 
instruction in State-aided schools, as well as those who were interested in cooking, 
sewing, drawing, handwork, and such other subjects as have been assigned to the work 
of this division.

  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 259 
Cooperation with the industries—In Rochester and Buffalo considerable progress 
has been made in effecting practical cooperation between the school authorities and 
representatives of industry. A formal agreement has been drawn up and entered 
into between the Rochester Typothets and the Rochester Shop School which pro- 
vides for a term of apprenticeship in the printing trade of four years, three months of 
which are to consist of a preliminary or “‘try-out” course at the Rochester Shop School. 
After this preliminary period the apprentice alternates weekly between the shop school 
and his employer’s printing plant, receiving a weekly wage of $4 for the remainder of 
the first six months, $4.50 for the second six months, $5 for the third six months, and 
$5.50 forthe fourth six months. The employer pays wages for the school time as well 
asforshop time. The remainder of the apprenticeship period is to be devoted entirely 
to the employers’ shop, the weekly wage being $9 for the first six months, $10 for the 
second six months, $11 for the third six months, and $12 for the fourth six months. 
During all of this time the apprentice is to be under the supervision of the shop school. 
Upon completion of the entire term of apprenticeship, having passed all the examina- 
tions, and being graduated from the shop school, the apprentice receives from the 
employer a bonus of $100. 
In Buffalo the executive committee of the master printers’ association, at their 
meeting June 27, 1912, adopted a resolution expressing hearty approval of the move- 
ment to establish a continuation school for the benefit of boys desiring to learn the 
printing trade, and pledging active support. All members of the association are 
recommended ‘‘to send their apprentices to such school for at least one-half day each 
week without deduction of pay for time spent during such instruction.” 
An apprenticeship agreement has been entered into by Typographical Union No. 9 
with the printing department of Vocational School No. 11 in Buffalo, in accordance 
with which graduates of the two-year day vocational course in printing are to be 
credited by the union with one year on their term of apprenticeship. Graduates who 
remain at the school and complete the two-year advanced day vocational course are 
to be credited by the union with an additional year on their apprenticeship. The 
agreement also provides for granting one-half year on the term of apprenticeship for 
the successful pursuit of evening courses or continuation courses. 
Special problems.—The great problem in this State is the establishment of all-day 
continuation schools. The following questions have arisen. The answers are yet to 
come. 
1, Is it practical to develop a continuation school in a community of 2,000 people 
having one industry and employing a small number of children; say, for example, 
seven? 
2. Is it wise for a State like New York, with 50 per cent of its school districts having 
a valuation of less than $60,000, to ask these small communities to develop continuation 
instruction when they can not properly sup pene their present education? 
3. Will the employers in all types of industry cooperate in the establishment of 
continuation school work? 
4, Can the work done by young people in all industries be so arranged that they 
can be dismissed from the factory for a few hours a week without damage to the manu- 
facturing process? 
5. What kind of school training will meet the permanent requirements of industry 
and the permanent requirements of citizenship? 
6. Is it possible to expect employers to pay the same wage as they now pay for five 
to eight hours’ less work in the factory, due to attendance upon continuation school? 
7. Can a complete program of part-time schooling be put immediately into 
operation and not greatly complicate the problem of public education, adding, as it 
will in any State of moderate size, from 50,000 to 150,000 children to the number 
already attending public schools? 
8. Is it possible to develop a body of teachers competent to deal with continuation 
school instruction in such a way that pupils will learn through a study of real things 
and not through a line of abstract thinking? 
9. Is part-time schooling practical in all industries which employ children under 16 
years of age? 
      
   
-P-A-G-E-298
  
  260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
10. Is it wise for the State to train definitely children of 14 years of age for lines of 
work which it knows lacks permanency to youth and in all probability are not per- 
manent needs in the industry? 
11. Isit practical or wise to give supplementary instruction relating to the temporary 
occupations of childhood; that is, delivery-wagon boys, telegraph messengers, elevator 
boys, doll makers, etc.? 
12. Should the State be a partner to an educational device for fitting children so 
perfectly to carry on their nonpermanent employment that they can never success- 
fully get out of that employment? 
Investigation.—The University of the State of New York and the New York State 
factory investigating commission are cooperating in the development of a report upon 
the economic value of vocational instruction. 
NEW JERSEY. 
Schools.—Examples of practically every type of school possible under the New 
Jersey vocational school law have been organized. These include: 
(1) All-day industrial schools for boys over 14. 
(2) All-day household arts schools for girls over 14. 
(3) Part-time or continuation day schools for boys over 14, regularly employed as 
apprentices. 
(4) Evening industrial classes for boys or girls over 16, employed as apprentices. 
(5) Evening household arts classes for girls over 17. 
(6) Short unit courses. 
(7) Vocational agricultural classes. 
During the past year Atlantic County has organized a county vocational school 
board. for the purpose of administering courses in agricultural education under the 
direction of a specialist in agriculture. 
Conferences—A number of important conferences have been held, which have been 
attended by the principals and directors of vocational schools. During the coming 
year these conferences are to be extended and provision will also be made for the 
teachers in the schools. 
Bulletin.—The department of public instruction has published a bulletin dealing 
with the work done in manual training in New Jersey. 
New appointment.—The staff of the vocational education division has been increased 
by the appointment of Mr, Edward A. Reuther as expert in manual training, effective 
September 1, 1914. 
  PENNSYLVANIA. 
Legislation.—While the school code of 1911 provided in a general way for vocational 
courses and schools, the vocational education law of 1913 makes a much more definite 
provision. It provides State aid for such vocational schools or departments as are 
approved by the Siate board of education. 
State aid for these vocational courses and schools did not become available until 
near the end of July, 1913. It was then too late to notify school districts of the provi- 
sions of the vocational education law in time for the districts to put such courses or 
schools into operation at the beginning of the school year in September. 
In spite of the fact that State aid for this type of education became available so late 
in the summer, much progress has already been made in the establishment of vocational 
schools and departments. Since August 1, 1913, 21 school districts in 17 different 
counties have qualified for State aid by establishing various types of vocational schools 
and departments. 
Twenty more school districts in 11 other counties are either considering the advis- 
ability of establishing such vocational schools or courses, or have already definitely 
decided to do'so. These will be put into operation in September, 1914. 
According to the present rate of development about 30 counties, nearly one-half the 
number of counties in the State, will be participating in September, 1914, in the State 
aid granted for vocational education.

PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 261 
Types of school.—There are three different types of vocational schools in operation in 
Pennsylvania at the present time: The all-day school, the evening school, and the 
part-time or continuation school. 
Bulletins Bulletins have been issued containing the regulations governing voca- 
tional schools as approved by the State board of education, as indicated below. 
Copies of these bulletins may be obtained from the vocational division, department of 
public instruction, Harrisburg, Pa. 
No. 1. Vocational Education in Pennsylvania. 
No. 2. Agricultural Schools and Departments. 
No. 3. Evening Classes in Industrial Education. 
No. 4. Household Arts Schools and Departments and Evening Classes. 
Agricultural education.—During the present school year five high schools located in 
as many different counties have maintained successful vocational departments of 
agriculture. In each case the department of agriculture is in charge of a trained 
supervisor. The men in charge of the five departments now in operation are graduates 
of agricultural colleges, and were, with one exception, born and raised on farms. 
They have all had farm experience. 
The five high schools maintaining vocational departments of agriculture are as 
follows: Waterford, Erie County; Montrose, Susquehanna County; Troy, Bradford 
County; Honesdale, Wayne County; Mount Pleasant Township, Westmoreland 
County. At least five other high schools in as many other counties will establish 
similar vocational departments of agriculture, beginning September, 1914. 
The qualifications of high-school supervisors of agriculture are very definitely out- 
lined in the requirements governing vocational agricultural schools and departments 
as approved by the State board of education. These provide, among other things, that 
such a teacher must have both practical farm experience and scientific training in 
agriculture. 
The following extracts from a report prepared by the division of agricultural educa- 
tion will give some idea of the scope of activities under way in the State: 
  Tn connection with the study of poultry raising in the department of agriculture of 
the Honesdale High School, various feeding and fattening experiments were carried 
on. Between 30 and 40 chickens, representing 9 different varieties, were used in these 
experiments, the chickens being kept in one of the basement rooms used by the depart- 
ment of agriculture. 
The following was taken from one of the Honesdale papers at the time of the Farmers’ 
Institute early this winter: 
Among the most interested listeners at the Farmers’ Institute, with notebooks in 
hand, were the members of the agricultural class of the Honesdale High School, in 
charge of Prof. Champion. These boys have studied farming enough so that they 
understand the terms in which the speakers handle their subjects. It does not take 
much of a prophet to foretell that there will be more scientific farming carried on in 
Wayne County in the near future than ever before in its history. 
Every boy enrolled in the vocational department of agriculture in a high school must 
carry on an agricultural project each year. Most of these projecis are projects in con- 
nection with farm crops and are carried on at the home farm. Some of them are poul- 
try projects which run for a period of one year. 
The following are a few of the projects taken by some of the boys: To determine the 
cost of raising an acre of potatoes; to determine the cost of producing anacre of corn; to 
determine the annual profit per fow! on a flock of 50 chickens; to determine the fat- 
tening qualities of various poultry rations; to determine the efficiency of various hog- 
fattening rations. 
County Supt. J. J. Koehler and James 8. Champion, supervisor of agriculture of the 
Honesdale High School, have organized a poultry. club among the boys of Wayne 
County. Between 60 and 75 boys had enrolled before April 1, and applications were 
coming in every day. <A poultry show will be held at the Honesdale Fair next fall, 
   
-P-A-G-E-300
    262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
at which time all of the boys enrolled in the poultry club will exhibit their fowls. 
Very substantial prizes have been offered. , 
Farmer’ s evening classes.—On the evening of March 10, 1914, the agricultural depart- 
ment of the Troy High School opened a series of meetings for farmers and others of the 
community interested in agriculture. At these meetings most of the time was devoted 
to the following subjects: Soils and fertilizers; dairy feeds and principles of dairy 
feeding, including instruction in the balancing of rations, etc.; crop rotations and crop 
culture, etc. 
Poultry inspection trips.—Only one poultry inspection has been made this spring 
by the students of the department of agriculture of the Troy High School, but it was 
interesting to note how quickly the students recognized flaws in management, and how 
easily they could diagnose the condition of the fowls and the reasons for such con- 
ditions. 
Poultry fattening experiment.—Poultry fattening experiments conducted by the 
students of the department of agriculture of the Troy High School last fall showed that 
profits in fattening poultry can be made only where a large flock can be handled, and 
that the fowls should be taken before they have reached their full growth. The con- 
dition of the fowl at the beginning of the experiment should be good, and the fattening 
period should be shortened to not more than 15 days, as after that time the cost of 
gain is greater than the increase in value. 
Homemaking.—The department of homemaking of the Montrose High School gave 
a very interesting and practical series of evening short unit courses in cooking. Food 
values, feeding growing children, meats, the fireless cooker, and fuels were some of 
the courses given. In the group of persons taking these courses were teachers, clerks, 
stenographers, dressmakers, storekeepers, and housekeepers, the latter predominating. 
Ages ranged from 20 toabout-50 years. The lessons were given by Mrs. Rebecca L. Gil- 
pin, who has made a success of the homemaking department in this high school. 
Similar reports are available from other agricultural schools, and from experiments 
under way, but must be omitted here for lack of space. Readers desiring further 
information are referred to the bulletins of the division. 
Present tendencies —While the vocational law in Pennsylvania provides for the 
all-day industrial school, the development thus far has been in the evening industrial 
school offering trade-extension courses, and in the continuation school. This is 
explained by the division as follows: 
This development is due to several factors, among which may be mentioned: (1) 
The time intervening between the passage of the act and the opening of the school 
year in September, 1913, was entirely too short to organize and equip schools so as to 
properly conduct day industrial work. (2) The needs of the men and boys now at work 
in the industries were very urgent, and it was possible to organize the evening trade- 
extension classes before the middie of October and still do efficient work before Easter. 
(3) It was possible to secure teachers for these evening trade-extension classes, inas- 
much as employment as a teacher in the evening industrial schools did not interfere 
with day employment. (4) An investigation of the day industrial schools now in 
operation in several States showed that for the amount of money expended, and the 
small group served by the day industrial school, it does not yield as large a return as 
either the evening industrial or the continuation school. (5) Vocational education 
is not a problem which can be solved by the schools alone. The manufacturers have 
a definite part to play in this great work. Their part is to furnish the practical in- 
struction, and the part of the school is to give the related technical and academic 
instruction. Whenever the instruction is given in the all-day industrial school the 
manufacturer does not asume his definite obligation, but it is shifted to the school. 
On the other hand, when the instruction is given in the continuation or evening 
industrial classes we have the ideal combination; that is, the manufacturer is using 
the equipment of his plant to give the practical instruction, while the schools are 
presenting a course in related technical and academic studies properly correlated with 
the practical work.

  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 263 
Evening industrial classes were conducted in the following places: Nanticoke, 
Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, Ellsworth, Cokesburg, Williamsport, Altoona, Philadelphia, 
Shickshinny, Pittsburgh, Wamanie, and Shamokin. 
Classes for mine workers.—The evening industrial classes conducted in Nanticoke, 
Wamanie, Shickshinny, and Shamokin were devoted to instruction for mine workers 
in the anthracite region. An analysis of the mining industries was made, and courses 
were planned so that the men attending the night school would receive valuable 
assistance in their regular employment. Such subjects as mine gases, mine ventila- 
tion, miring law, mine surveying, mining arithmetic, drawing suitable to the needs 
of the men employed about the colliery, elementary mechanics, and electricity 
adapted to the needs of the breaker boy and motor runners were taught in the evening 
industrial schools. 
In the absence of a text adapted to the needs of these evening mining classes Mr. 
J.J. Walsh, mine inspector of the tenth anthracite district, wrote a series of 46 lessons 
dealing with gases and ventilation. These lessons were mimeographed in the depart- 
ment and forwarded to the various schools. 
Applicants for teaching positions in the mining classes were examined in the several 
towns in which these classes were conducted. A considerable number of men qualified 
as teachers and were granted State certificates 
The men who were employed as teachers in the evening mining classes have had 
experience in the mines ranging from 6 to 21 years. In some instances a successful 
teacher of science or mathematics was placed in the same classroom with the practical 
miner. By this arrangement it was hoped that it would be possible to train the 
practical man gradually in the art of teaching. 
The advisory committees in the mining institutes have given valuable assistance 
to the local school authorities directly in charge of the evening mining classes. The 
mining institutes have employed one of their members for two weeks out of every 
month while the school was in session to act as a visitor. This person visited the 
schools, kept a record of attendance, and made it his business to keep in close touch 
with the men at their various places of employment. He was, therefore, in a position 
to know when one of them was absent and to give assistance when needed. This ar- 
rangement resulted in an increased average attendance at the evening schools. Besides 
visiting the schools and the students, the visitor arranged for talks to be given by citi- 
zens and by others who were experts in their particular line. At least four of these 
talks were given before the schools every month. 
At Ellsworth and Cokesburg, evening classes were conducted for the bituminous 
mine workers of that district. Instruction in gases, ventilation, and mining law was 
given. The lesson sheets for these classes were prepared by Mr. Bach and Mr. Cooper, 
to meet the needs of the class. 
In Wilkes-Barre shop mathematics, sketching, and English were offered to men 
employed in the machine shops, boiler-making shops, and foundries. 
Williamsport offered courses for a number of trades, such as carpenters, electricians, 
and machinists. 
The Philadelphia Trade School gave work during the past year in the making 
and reading of drawings, and shop mathematics for cabinetmakers, mechanical 
and architectural draftsmen, machinists, patternmakers, plumbers, and sheet-metal 
workers. A course was offered in making and reading drawings for bricklayers and 
electricians, in interior decorating for interior decorators, also several courses for 
printers, sign painters, and electricians. 
At Scranton the equipment of the technical high school was used to give trade 
extension courses to machinists and patternmakers. Courses in drawing and shop 
mathematics were also offered for machinists, architects, plumbers, masons, and sheet 
metal workers.  
-P-A-G-E-302
  264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
At York a continuation school has been in successful operation for three years. The 
boys devote half their time to shopwork and half their time to related academic and 
technical subjects. The instruction in the shopwork is given in a number of shops, 
while the scholastic work is given in a room fitted up in the York high school. Nearly 
125 boys are enrolled in this cooperative course. The majority of them are employed 
in machine shops, although there are several enrolled in the plumbing and cabinet- 
making courses. 
Investigations —In the belief that the successful introduction of vocational educa- 
tion into any district depends upon a thorough knowledge of industrial conditions of 
that community, the division has insisted that an investigation or survey be made 
before final action is taken. Surveys have been made in Altcona, Homestead, and a 
number of other places with a view to determining the need for a vocational school. 
Before it was possible to determine upon the content of the course of study for the 
evening mining schools, it was necessary that an analysis of the mining industry be 
made. When this matter was brought to the attention of the Susquehanna Coal 
Co., they very kindly consented to place at the disposal of the expert in industrial 
education several stenographers and a number of men employed about the mines. 
Asa result of this investigation, it was found that there are 50 classified jobs inside the 
mines and 30 classified jobs outside the mines. With the information thus secured, 
a course of study for the evening school was then planned. An analysis of the steel 
industry and textile industry will be made in the near future. 
Cooperation with industry—None of the industrial concerns that have been 
approached on the matter of cooperation have refused to consider the matter, and in 
every case they have given great assistance to the division. 
The Mesta Machine Co. and the Carnegie Steel Co. of Homestead have rendered 
valuable aid in the preparation of plans for the Homestead school. The Susquehanna 
Coal Co., the West End Coal Co., the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre, the Delaware, Lacka- 
wanna & Western, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal Co., and the Ellsworth Collieries 
have cooperated with the division in the development of the evening mining schools. 
WISCONSIN. 
Legislation.—In June, 1911, Wisconsin passed a law providing for public industrial, 
commercial, continuation, and evening schools. During the year 1911-12 two 
schools were established and maintained, one at Racine and one at Manitowoc. 
During the year 1912-13 schools were maintained at Beaver Dam, Beloit, Chippewa 
Falls, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, Janesville, Kenosha, La Crosse, Madison, Manitowoc, 
Marinette, Milwaukee, Oshkosh, Racine, Sheboygan, South Milwaukee, Superior, 
Two Rivers, Wausau, and West Allis. The number of persons served in the day 
classes during that year is approximately 6,000, and a little more than that in the 
evening classes. 
Tn the year 1913-14 schools were maintained in all of the above-named cities, and also 
in Appleton, Marshfield, Menasha, Menomonie, and Neenah. The number of persons 
served in day classes is approximately 11,000, and in the evening classes 14,000. 
The law provides that each city of 5,000 inhabitants or over shall have an indus- 
trial board of five members appointed by the regular board of education. All cities 
of the State having a population of 5,000 inhabitants have complied with this law, 
with the exception of Baraboo, Merrill, Oconto, and Rhinelander. The State reim- 
burses each city one-half of its expenditures in maintaining any one of these schools, 
provided that the State aid shall not exceed $3,000 for any one school in any one year, 
and that no city shall receive more than $10,000 State aid in any one year. The 
legislature of 1913 amended the law of 1911 by increasing the State aid from $35,000 
annually to $150,000 annually. It increased the number of schools to be established. 
from 30 to 45.

PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 265 
Types of school_—Four classes of school have been established under the provisions 
of the law: 
1. Industrial school: This includes day apprentices over 16 years of age and also 
all-day industrial activities for persons 14 to 21 years of age. 
2. Continuation school: This school is for all persons 14 to 16 years of age who are 
employed under labor permits, or persons 14 to 16 employed in domestic service. 
3. Commercial school: This school is for persons over 16 years of age, temporarily 
unemployed, or for exceptional pupils who wish to become efficient salesmen or 
accountants. 
4, Evening classes: These classes are for persons over 16 years of age. 
Bulletins —Numerous bulletins have been issued from time to time dealing with 
various phases of the work. 
New work.—During the year 1913-14 the cities of Wisconsin spent over $400,000 for 
vocational education. Much of this was spent for work already begun, and the 
remainder for establishing and maintaining new activities. It is expected that the 
amount of State aid will be increased, and that during the coming year the amount 
spent for maintaining vocational schools and classes will exceed $500,000. 
Teachers’ conferences.—One important phase of the work is an annual teachers’ 
conference and institute, lasting two or three days, and bringing together practically 
all of the teachers and directors of industrial schools, 2nd many members of the indus- 
trial boards and advisory committees. The proceedings of the 1913 conference were 
published for distribution as Bulletin No. 8. The 1914 conference was held at Mil- 
waukee, September 2, 3, 4. 
Special problem.—The special problem confronting the department of public instruc- 
tion in Wisconsin, at the present time, is to be able to foster the apprenticeship con- 
tract under the terms of the industrial education law. The number of apprentices in 
the State has doubled in the past year. 
Investigations —Investigations of industrial conditions are under way in various 
parts of the State. For this purpose a questionnaire schedule has been prepared 
that secures the information in form convenient for tabulation. The principal items 
inquired into are the wages, hours, conditions, and character of employment of boys 
and girls at work under 16 years of age; possibility of adjustment to the program of a 
continuation school; amount and character of training already acquired. ’ 
INDIANA, 
Vocational education as it is developed in Indiana is based on the theory that effi- 
cient vocational education for the State should be an integral and fundamental part 
of the public school system of the State. The Indiana State program for vocational 
education involves more than merely establishing new branches of special schools 
devoted to the giving of efficient vocational instruction in preparation for profitable 
employment in the shop, in the home, or on the farm. The idea of fitting each indi- 
vidual in the State for some useful form of work is made a dominant purpose of the 
public school work of the State. 
Legislation.—Three important types of work are provided for by the Indiana law: 
1. County agents of agriculture may be appointed for each county in the State. 
Men with practical agricultural experience and scientific training, whose entire time 
is to be devoted to giving a sort of trade extension work to the farmers of their respec- 
tive counties and helping them to become more productive in their work. Thirty- 
two such agents have been appointed and are successfully carrying on this trade- 
extension work. 
2. The law requires that elementary instruction in agriculture, in domestic science, 
and in the industrial arts be given as a part of the regular course of instruction in all 
the schools of the State. Instruction in these subjects is now being given in the 
seventh and eighth grades and in all the high schools of the State. Asa result of this 
     
-P-A-G-E-304
  266 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
provision of the law, 114,078 pupils, a little more than one-fifth of all the pupils en- 
rolled in the public schools of the State, were studying these practical arts subjects 
as a part of their regular course of instruction in the regular schools of the State last 
year. During 1913-14, there were 116 special township supervisors appointed to help 
carry on this instruction in the practical arts subjects, and special steps were taken to 
get teachers properly trained for this work. For the present school year the extension 
department of Purdue University has donated to the State department the services 
of three men to assist in organizing and supervising the work in agriculture. Indiana 
University has placed one man at the service of the State department who will 
assist with the work in industrial arts. All three State institutions, the State Normal 
College, University of Indiana, and Purdue University, will assist the department in 
organizing and supervising the work in domestic science by placing at the disposal 
of the department one trained professor from each institution to assist with the instruc- 
tion in home economics in the regular schools. i 
8. A third line of work provided for by the Indiana law (in fact, the chief provision 
of the law) is the real vocational instruction to be carried on in special vocational de- 
partments and schools organized and conducted for the sole purpose of preparing for 
efficient and productive work in the shop, in the home, and on the farm. To stimu- 
late and encourage local communities to establish such vocational schools in their 
respective communities, the State pays two-thirds the cost of instruction in all voca- 
tional schools that are approved by the State board of education. This provision of 
the law went into effect September 1, 1914, and special attention will be given this 
year to the organization and supervision of this vocational work. Some 12 or 15 cen- 
ters will be organized this year and the vocational work developed as rapidly as pos- 
sible. Part-time and trade extension work in evening classes are being emphasized, 
and it is hoped that an effective plan for vocational guidance in the regular schools 
may be worked out to serve as the basis for vocational instruction in all-day vocational 
schools. Several experiments in different types of communities will be made during 
the year, also, in training teachers for vocational schools. 
Bulletins.—The following bulletins have been issued by the vocational division of 
the department of public instruction since June 1, 1913: 
1. Letter of Information to Superintendents Regarding the Vocational Education 
Law and Work for Next School Year. Vocational Series No. 1, June, 1913.

CALIFORNIA. 
In 1913 the California Legislature changed the central organization for educational 
affairs, and created a State board of education consisting of seven members. The 
same act provided that the State board of education should appoint a commissioner 
of vocational education, and in September, 1913, Dr. Edwin R. Snyder was appointed 
to this position. The school law is drawn in such terms that it is possible for any school 
district to introduce and maintain classes in vocational education. In the various 
high schools of the State 46 different vocations are now taught. Some of the high 
schools, notably those in Los Angeles, cover almost the entire group of vocations. 
However, the report of the commissioner of vocational education states that this 
subject is still in its infancy in California. 
There are a few night schools in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland that are 
of the vocational type. A considerable proportion of rural high schools have intro- 
duced courses in agriculture, a few of which are broad enough in scope to be considered 
largely vocational.” 
The State board of education has gone upon record as favoring State aid to vocational 
education, and an attempt will be made to secure suitable legislation in 1915, which 
will be broad enough to include every type of vocational school, department, or class 
in any type of public school, regular day, day continuation, or night school. Steps 
will also be taken to modify the law governing certification of teachers, so that it may 
provide for vocational certificates. The legislature will be requested also to provide, 
in addition to the aid already given upon account of elementary and secondary schools, 
an amount which will approximately equal one-third of the total expenditure for 
instruction in vocational schools and classes. 
5. ACTIVITIES OF ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN VOCATIONAL 
EDUCATION. 
The year 1913-14 has been an important one in the sphere of 
activities of professional teachers’ and other organizations interested 
in vocational education. A great deal of the enthusiasm and in- 
terest, and within the past year or two, of positive and purposeful 
activity has been crystallized in a number of organizations that are 
making their several influences felt in no uncertain terms. The 
following paragraphs will serve to give a fairly comprehensive, even 
if hasty, glance at the kinds of work undertaken by the most im- 
portant of these organizations: 
  NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
The National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education 
continues as one of the positive forces in the movement for more 
widespread and more effective vocational education. While propa- 
ganda work through the publication and distribution of valuable 
material on the subject is recognized as an important function of the 
society, it has also been engaged in such constructive work as (1) : 
assisting to shape legislation; (2) investigations and surveys made 
either directly by the society or in cooperation with other agencies; 
(3) holding of a series of conferences, dealing with principles and 
policies and methods of administration; (4) cooperating with other 
agencies in the solution of new problems. 
   
-P-A-G-E-306
  268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
LEGISLATION. 
Virginia:—The national society advised and assisted the Virginia State educational 
authorities in framing a statute authorizing local school authorities to introduce 
various forms of vocational education, and authorizing the State board of education 
to assist in the maintenance and supervision of such work. 
AMissouri.—A questionnaire was prepared by the Missouri State teachers’ association 
in line with the suggestions of the secretary of the society and sent to the leading 
educators and business men in the State, for the purpose of ascertaining the need for 
industrial education in Missouri, and the best method of meeting the necd. As the 
result of this questionnaire, a report was issued defining the various types of education, 
stating what had been accomplished in other States and giving results of the question- 
naire as to organization, methods of control, support, and types of schools best adapted 
to Missouri, together with a proposed law embodying the principles of legislation set 
forth in the platform of the national society. 
The introduction of similar legislation is now under consideration 
in the States of Washington, Iowa, and Michigan, and the educational 
authorities in these States are in conference with the national society 
in regard to methods of procedure and best form of legislation. 
INVESTIGATIONS AND SURVEYS, 
Richmond, Va.—A year ago the national society initiated the policy of cooperating 
with, the city in which it is to hold its annual convention in making a school and in- 
dustrial survey which should be made the basis of a coustructive program of action 
on the part of the community and the national society. It was decided to hold the 
annual convention this year at Richmond. In accordance with this policy the 
society, with the assistance of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 
Russell Sage Foundation, and the educational authorities of Richmond, has been 
carrying forward an exhaustive survey of the industries and schools of the city. 
The survey was in the immediate charge of two expcrts, one from the Russeil Sage 
Foundation and one from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, working under 
the guidance of the local survey committee, the whole survey being directed by a 
general committee appointed by the National Society for the Promotion of Indus- 
trial Education, consisting of representatives from the national society, and from 
various labor, educational, commercial, and manufacturing organizations. 
That part of the survey dealing with, the school side is concerned only with data 
that had to do with the relation of the school to industry. I+ aimed to obtain infor- 
mation upon such questions as the following: 
1. Amount and causes of attendance mortality. 
2. The occupations into which pupils have gone upon leaving school. 
3. The present opportunities for vocational training in the public and private schools. 
The industrial side of the survey sought to obtain the information necessary for 
determining a constructive program for vocational training for the city of Richmond. 
Such questions as the following were answered: 
1. What is the general industrial situation in the community, such as the proportion 
of industrial workers to the total population? 
. What is the eeonomic status of the community, and its social attitude toward 
industrial work? 
. What is the situation as regards variety and concentration of industries? 
. Do the industries concerned represent that which, from the civic and social stand- 
oint, it is desirable to encourage? 
What does an analysis of each industry reveal as to the demands upon the worker 
with respect to the knowledge and skill necessary for efficient service? 
. What does the industry itself furnish by way of training, and what must be supplied 
by the school?

The data obtained in the survey served as laboratory material for the convention. 
A synopsis of the findings was prepared in advance and widely distributed. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS. 
During the past year, the following investigations in charge of a 
special committee on women’s work were undertaken by the assistant 
secretary of the society, Miss Cleo Murtland: 
Troy.—In Troy an intensive study of the collar and cuff industry was made, some 
study of department stores, together with a study of the new vocational school of Troy 
and its opportunities for cooperating with existing industries and social agencies. 
Grand Rapids.—Immediately following the convention of the society in December, 
1913, a study was made on vocational opportunities for girls and women in that city. 
This report presented an analysis of the industries under the heads of skilled, semi- 
skilled, and unskilled. Information was gathered on the types of factory workers; 
the range of age in the industry; the shifting or change of the workers; how the new 
workers entered the trade; and ending with the recommendations as to types of 
schools which should be established, and outlines of courses of study to be pursued in 
such schools. 
Philadelphia.—A study of vocational opportunities for girls and women in the city 
of Philadelphia was made under the auspices of the Philadelphia consumer’s league. 
The league had for five years gathered material valuable in character which was used 
as a basis for further study and for the preparation of a report brought before the board 
of education of that city, with definite recommendations on a plan for the establish- 
ment of classes or schools in women’s industries. 
New York City—Dress and waist industry.—Believing that eae time education is to 
be a most important type of vocational education, the ‘Women’ 'S committee gave an 
important place to the study of a typical industry, lo g toward the establishment 
of part-time vocational instruction. The dress and waist industry of New York—an 
industry employing 30,000 workers, more than 80 per cent of whom are women—was 
chosen. The industry itself was analyzed, the occupations studied, and plans for a 
part-time factory school, together with plans for managing and financing the school, 
were presented to the Dress & Waist Manufacturers’ Association and the International 
Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union, Local No. 25. The final adoption of this report 
and the establishment of a school are still pending. This report was published by the 
United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
In addition to this work the society has assisted, by one means or another, surveys 
in the cities of New Orleans and Cincinnati.    
CONFERENCES. 
One of the most important activities in which the society has been 
engaged during the past year was the holding of a series of confer- 
ences with State officials and others engaged in the administration 
of agricultural and industrial education. 
The society has been especially fortunate in obtaining for these 
conferences the Goodhue estate, on Staten Island, now owned by the 
Children’s Aid Society of New York City. This estate is maintained 
by that society as a vacation home for the children and teachers of 
their schools, and has all the facilities for housing and entertaining 
a large group of people. Located as it is, in the outskirts of the city, 
it offers an ideal place in which to conduct a conference.  
-P-A-G-E-308
    270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1014, 
These meetings have usually lasted from three to four days and 
have drawn from 20 to 40 men, representing 12 to 15 States and the 
Dominion of Canada. 
The meetings have been conducted as round-table conferences 
according to a prearranged program, dealing with such practical 
questions as these: (1) State legislation; (2) administration and 
organization; (3) national legislation; (4) terminology and standards 
and procedure in the administration of State-aided vocational educa- 
tion. 
A special program déaling with the problems of agricultural educa- 
tion was also carried out by members of the conference concerned 
with this branch of vocational education. 
These conferences have served to clarify and define the aims, prob- 
lems, and practice of the administration of vocational education, 
and have gone far to develop unanimity of opinion with respect to 
many controversial issues in the various States. They have served 
to establish efficient standards of procedure in State administration of 
vocational education. They have assisted in formulating terminology 
and practice which may be made the basis of communication between 
the several States. They have furthermore done much to develop a 
strong professional spirit and fellowship among the men engaged in 
this work. 
RICHMOND CONVENTION. 
As pointed out above, the program of the convention at Richmond 
largely dealt with the findings of the survey, attention being given to 
such topics as the following: 
1. The types of schools which could be established as determined by the financial 
and general school conditions. 
2. The types of schools and training needed as determined by the industrial conditions 
of Richmond. 
8. The compulsory attendence problem and its bearing on vocational training. 
4. The problem of the private school in industrial education. 
The convention ended with a visit on Saturday to Hampton Insti- 
tute, the Newport News Shipbuilding Yards, and an inspection of 
the Coast Artillery School at Fortress Monroe, Va. 
PLACEMENT BUREAU WORK. 
The calls upon this society for aid in suggesting teachers, super- 
visors, and directors in vocational education have increased greatly 
with the spread of the movement. The fact that it has not been 
possible for the society to supply the demand is due largely to the 
fact that the salaries offered have not been high enough to compete 
with the trade rate of compensation and to the great scarcity of 
persons fitted to meet the varied and exacting requirements of this 
new work.

Pratt Institute. During the past year a class for the training of trade teachers 
was conducted at Pratt Institute, which was in a measure a direct result of the 
Report on the Training and Certification of Teachers made earlier in the year 
by the society, and was conducted in agreement with the principles and poli- 
cies laid down in that report. The society further cooperated in this experi- 
ment by conferences with the authorities of Pratt Institute and the Board of 
Education of New York City, concerning the aim and conduct of the work, by 
supplying to the class literature on industrial education, assisting in placing 
the graduates of the course, and by otherwise placing at the disposal of the 
instructor the resources of the office.

New York State Factory Investigating Commission—A study was made of the 
paper-box industry and department stores from the standpoint of the possi- 
bility of vocational training in these industries. This investigation, which 
also included a study of the wage value of vocational training, was made for 
the purpose of gathering information to be used in connection with a report 
by the commission on a proposed minimum-wage law; and, though, very brief, 
was conducted along the general lines previously worked out by the society in 
the survey of the dress and waist industry. The investigation, which was 
confined largely to New York City, was under the direction of Wesley A. 
O’Leary, of the society, who was working with the advice and assistance of 
C. A. Prosser. ~ 
Board of Education, New York City—Informal conferences were held from time 
to time with various officials in the department of education concerning prob- 
Jems of industrial education, especially those having to do with the examina- 
tion and certification of teachers; the equipment and organization of schools; 
and the adaptation of the work of the lecture bureau to the industrial educa- 
tional needs of the people. At the request of a committee from the board of 
education, a plan for the examination and licensing of teachers was formulated 
and presented in conference with the committee. 
NATIONAL VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE ASSOCIATION. 
In October, 1913, a meeting was called in Grand Rapids, Mich., 
for the purpose of considering the advisability of organizing a society 
to study the problems of vocational guidance. There was a hearty 
response, a large and enthusiastic attendance, and careful delibera- 
tion over the respective merits of a plan to organize as a section or 
department of some existing association, and of a plan to found an 
independent organization. After full discussion the counsel of the 
advocates of the latter plan prevailed, and the National Vocational 
Guidance Association was organized. 
The constitution adopted at Grand Rapids provides for an execu- 
tive council of five members, upon which rests the responsibility 
for directing association activity. Prof. Frank M. Leavitt, Uni- 
vorsity of Chicago, was elected president, and Mr. Jesse B. Davis, of 
Grand Rapids, Mich., secretary. At the first annual convention, 
held in Richmond, Va., December, 1914, in conjunction with the 
meeting of the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial 
Education, an admirable program was presented. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE MIDDLE WEST. 
The vocational Education Association of the Middle West was 
founded in 1913 in response to a demand for a society to voice the 
vocational creed of men and women engaged in education, in com- 
merce, or in industry. Article II of the constitution states that: 
The objects of this association shall be to study problems relating to vocational 
education and to bring the results of this study to public attention for the purpose of 
fostering types of education that will meet the vocational needs of youth and the 
reasonable demands of industry for efficient workers, while preserving those elements 
of general education necessary for good citizenship in a democracy.
-P-A-G-E-311
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 273 
The leaders in the organization of the association take the position 
that affiliation with national associations for industrial education, 
while highly desirable, will not satisfy the local needs of the Middle 
West. For this reason it was decided to organize a society for the 
study of special conditions and problems in the Mississippi Valley, 
and to formulate plans for an effective coordination of the various 
agencies interested in vocational education. i 
The association has set up two definite aims: (1) To meet as a 
study class for the discussion of ways and means to promote the 
best types of vocational education. For this purpose members will 
visit industrial plants, and public, private, and corporation schools 
where experiments in vocational education are being carried on. 
The information obtained from these visits, and from other sources, 
will be analyzed through class discussions open to all members. 
These preliminary discussions will be utilized to determine the special 
features to be presented in public at the annual convention of the 
association. (2) The association will endeavor to arouso public sen- 
timent in favor of careful legislative action, if legislation seems neces- 
sary to the accomplishment of the ends sought. 
The by-laws provide for the organization of four special working 
committees, of 11 members each, whose duties shall be to study the 
topics suggested by the titles of the committees, and to present the 
results of such study to the committees on program and publicity. 
The titles of the committees are: Commercial education, industrial 
education, agricultural education, vocational guidance. 
The permanent organization of the board of directors, to consist 
of the officers and 30 additional members, has not yet been perfected. 
It is proposed to make the board representative of all agencies inter- 
ested in vocational education. The president of the association is 
Mr. W. J. Bogan, principal, Lane Technical High School, Chicago, 
and the secretary is Miss Anne S. Davis. The offices of the associa- 
tion are at Sedgwick and Division Streets, Chicago. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, 
Programs both of the superintendent’s department of the Na- 
tional Education Association and of the regular meeting in July tend 
to establish the fact that vocational education has come to be recog- 
nized as one of the permanent movements in education. This is 
further emphasized by the renaming of the department of the Na- 
tional Education Association, formerly known as Manual Training and 
Art, which is now to be known as the Department of Vocational 
Education and Practical Arts. 
It is especially significant that most of the sessions held by nearly 
all departments at the meeting in St. Paul dealt with some phase 
of the problem of vocational education.

274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Much work has been accomplished by the special committee upon 
vocational education and vocational guidance, appointed at the 
Chicago meeting. A report of progress was presented and accepted, 
and an additional appropriation of $500 allowed the committee for 
the continuance of the work. The personnel of the committee re- 
mains the same as last year, with Robert J. Fuller, superintendent 
of schools, North Attleboro, Mass., as chairman. 
The report of the committee this year took the form of two pam- 
phlets: 
(1) The first, 64 pages, consisted of a questionnaire submitted by 
the chairman to several hundred members of the association. The 
varied replies illustrated in this pamphlet, together with the com- 
parative unanimity of opinion on the main issues involved, serve 
as a basis not only for further action of the committee, but for the 
assistance of any who are interested in introducing this work into 
school systems. 
| (2) The second piece of work of this committee was a report on 
terminology, prepared by Dr. David Snedden, commissioner of edu- 
cation for Massachusetts, assisted by Mr. C. R. Allen, and the chair- 
| : man of the committee. The general adoption throughout the 
| country of the terms thus prepared would result in less confusion 
| than at present exists in the use of the terms in vocational educa- 
tion, not only in discussion, but in actual practice in carrying for- 
: ward other work. 
It is now proposed by this committee to continue the preparation 
of the handbook referred to last year, and to add to the previous 
work studies in vocational guidance under the direction of the chair- 
man of the subcommittee, Mr. Meyer Bloomfield.   
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATION SCHOOLS. 
The National Association of Corporation Schools came into exist- 
ence in 1913 as the result of the establishment, by several large in- 
dustrial corporations, of educational courses for the benefit of their 
‘ employees. Thirty-one corporations sent delegates to the organ- 
izing convention, which was held in one of the recitation rooms of 
New York University, New York, N. Y., January 24, 1913. 
Dayton, Ohio, was selected for the first annual convention, which 
was held in September, 1913, in the plant of the National Cash Reg- 
ister Company. The second convention was held in June, 1914, in 
the auditorium of the Curtis Publishing Co., Philadelphia. 
Objects—The officers assert that it is not the desire of the Na- 
tional Association of Corporation Schools, or of any of its constituent 
members so far as known, that the Federal Government, the State, 
or the municipality should prepare children to do certain lines of 
work in the interest of corporations. The functions of the associa-
-P-A-G-E-313
Re ee ne eR ee er ere en eee 
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 275 
tion are declared to be: (1) To develop the efficiency of the indi- 
vidual employee; (2) to increase efficiency in industry; (3) to seek 
the modification of courses in established educational institutions in 
order that they may more fully meet the needs of industry. 
The officers of the association protest that in many unauthorized 
attempts at public explanation or criticism, its motives and pur- 
poses have been entirely misunderstood. The association professes 
to stand on the broad platform of education in the best interests of 
the individual, as well as of industry, and the social whole. ‘‘Amer- 
ican industry needs every effort to get young men and women 
broadly educated, and individually developed, so far as possible. 
The question of specific knowledge is entirely incidental, and can 
be easily supplied after the individual has secured a broad education.” 
Membership.—Members are divided into three classes: Class A 
members, including commercial, industrial, and transportation com- 
panies, or governmental organizations, whether under corporation, 
firm, or individual ownership, which now are or may be interested 
in the education of their employees. 
Class B members, including officers, managers, or instructors of 
schools conducted by corporations that are class A members. 
Class C members, including those in sympathy with the objects 
of the association, who are not eligible for membership in class A 
or class B. : 
The class A membership numbered 56 corporations August 1, 
1914. The president is Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, General Electric 
Company. A series of monthly bulletins is published and distrib- 
uted from the office of the assistant secretary-treasurer, F. C. Hender- 
schott, Irving Place and Fifteenth Street, New York, N. Y. 
CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
In a recent number of ‘The Nation’s Business,” the official organ 
of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, the statement is 
made editorially that “all commercial organizations exist because of 
an intention to confer community benefit.”” Actuated by some such 
spirit as this, the local chambers of commerce in all parts of the 
country are taking an active interest in educational affairs, and 
especially, during the past year, in proposals for vocational education. 
The officials of the national organization recently conducted an 
investigation to determine just what is being done in various 
cities, and report themselves as highly gratified—   to find that commercial organizations in all parts of the country are showing definite 
interest in the better preparation of boys for work in the world. The results indicate 
that when the need of the community has been ascertained, the commercial organi- 
zation is the center of an immediate effort to better conditions.
-P-A-G-E-314
  276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
It frequently happens that the interest taken in these problems by 
the chamber of commerce acts as a stimulus to other agencies in the 
community, and in many cases serves to unite all forces in a concerted 
study of vocational education needs. 
It is impossible in this chapter to do more than to mention a few 
instances, selected almost at random, from the many cities where 
the chambers of commerce are active. Further detailed information 
can be found in the official publication.’ - 
Hamilton, Ohio.—The chamber of commerce took up the question of industrial edu- 
cation through the part-time or cooperative classes. The board of education was 
induced to engage a practical instructor, to enter into agreements with the principal 
factories by which instruction for one-half day each week is provided for apprentices 
who attend school on the companies’ time. 
Grand Rapids, Mich.—The Junior Association of Commerce is acting as a clearing 
house for boys and girls from the public schools who must go to work and for employers 
who need workers. The effort is to locate the individual in the right place with the 
least possible loss of time and effort. 
Indiana.—The chambers of commerce in Richmond, Indiana Harbor, East Chicago, 
and other cities are investigating the needs for vocational education, and are studying 
the necessary readjustments of the work in manual training in order to make it more 
distinctly industrial in character, and thus comply with the industrial education law. 
The entire State of Indiana is being carefully worked over by the cooperative efforts 
of committees of the chambers of commerce, looking toward the development of 
efficient plans for vocational education. 
Syracuse, N. ¥Y:—A committee of the chamber of commerce is at work on a plan for 
directing the efforts of boys and girls from the public schools in preparing for and 
securing employment for which they are best adapted. 
Dayton, Ohio.—The chamber of commerce, in conjunction with the Bureau of Munici- 
pal Research, has been active in a community study that includes as one of its chief 
divisions the problem of vocational education. The report is to cover a statement of 
conditions as they are, with existing facilities for meeting the needs; a summary of 
what inquiry shows to be the best methods now employed in other cities; and recom- 
mendations for future development. 
Bloomington, Ill.—The commercial club assisted in securing a bond issue for $250,000 
in the interest of the further development of vocational education and manual training. 
WOMEN’S MUNICIPAL LEAGUE, BOSTON, MASS. 
Since the publication, in 1913, of a “Handbook of Opportunities 
for Vocational Training in Boston,’”’ by a committee of the Women’s 
Municipal League, the committee has, by request of the school depart- 
ment, collected information regarding organizations in the city 
which cooperate with the public schools. This information was pub- 
lished in the report of the city superintendent of schools for.1913. 
The “Handbook” has been given a wide circulation in the city, 
copies being placed in the public schools, the public library and its 
12 branches, the State employment bureau, and the State depart- 
ment for minor wards. In addition, copies have been ordered by   
1 The Nation’s Business, published monthly by the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, Riggs 
Building, Washington, D. C.
-P-A-G-E-315
    PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. OTe 
many private organizations in Boston and other cities, including 
associated charities, juvenile courts, newsboys’ clubs, churches, social 
settlements, and department stores. A committee of the league is 
aiding in the development of the placement bureau, in which a num- 
ber of organizations are cooperating. 
6. NEW POSITIONS CREATED. 
One of the evidences of progress in vocational education is to be 
found in the creation of a number of new positions for the express 
purpose of facilitating study and action in this field. The most im- 
portant of these new positions are the following: 
DIRECTOR OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE, PHILADELPHIA. 
At the April, 1914, meeting of the Board of Education of Phila- 
delphia, Mr. John C. Frazee was elected director of vocational educa- 
tion and guidance. At the time of the preparation of this report 
sufficient time had not elapsed for the perfecting of plans, never- 
theless the following prospectus suggests the possibilities that are 
opening up before the new department. 
Vocational education in the elementary schools.—It is desired to accomplish as much as 
possible of the vocational education of pupils while they are in the elementary schools. 
While here their opinions regarding work may be shaped, habits of personal responsi- 
bility in work formed, and the way cleared for a higher type of continuation education 
than if the beginning of their vocational education were postponed till the pupils 
were almost ready to enter employment. 
It is the purpose of this department that the shopwork of the seventh and eighth 
years shall become really vocational. It is not intended to have a “‘course of study” 
fortheshops. A considerable amount of work will be undertaken for the local school, 
for the homes of the pupils, for the pupils themselves, and for the board of education’s 
supply department. 
Parallel with the shopwork a ‘ ‘finding course’’ for the boys will be developed. This 
will be of an informational nature, and its purpose will be to bring to the boy a knowl- 
edge of the industrial and commercial business of Philadelphia and its environs. This 
will be the educative side of vocational guidance. 
Elementary shop schools.—There are in Philadelphia, in the regular classes, 8,202 
boys who are 12 years or more of age and who are two or more years over age for their 
classes. In addition to these, there are about 400 boys who are 12 years or more of age 
and who are in special classes as ‘‘disciplinary pupils,”’ but who are not classified as 
“backward.’’? Many of these 8,600 boys will be better served in elementary shop 
schools, which should offer five half days per week of shopwork and five half days of 
academic work especially adapted to their requirements. Shops in printing, wood- 
work, flat-metal work, electrical work, metal machining, plumbing, and pipe fitting 
are under consideration. These shop schools would probably not be separate adminis- 
trative units, but would be departments of a regular elementary school, under the 
jurisdiction of its principal. With the exception of a ‘‘preparatory class’’ in the 
“Trades School,’’ this work has not been touched. 
There are also in Philadelphia 7,623 girls belonging in the same classification with 
the boys just mentioned. With the schools of the same membership as those proposed 
for the boys, 25 elementary shop schools for girls are necessary. At present there is 
no such school in Philadelphia.

278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Vocational education for backward classes.—There are in special classes in Philadel- 
phia about 2,000 ‘‘backward’’ pupils over 12 years of age. Vocational training for 
these pupils is a problem to which attention is being given. 
Preemployment vocational education.—The elementary shop school should lead many 
boys and girls at 15 or 16 years of age into definite preemployment vocational schools, 
which are neither of the elementary nor of the high-school type. 
At present the ‘‘Trade School’’ is serving a limited number of boys in this capacity, 
but as yet nothing of the kind is provided for girls. It is hoped that this work will be 
extended for both sexes. 
Vocational guidance.—Vocational guidance as contemplated will be of two phases: 
The educational phase, in which the pupils are made aware of the vocational oppor- 
tunities and requirements confronting them; and the phase of work involved in a 
placement bureau, which has been authorized by the board of education. 
On the former side it is designed that the manual work of all pupils in the elementary 
schools shall be accompanied by a definite study of local industries and business, so 
that by the time these pupils are ready to go into employment they may view the 
world of work with as much intelligence as possible. 
On the side of the placement bureau it is planned that pupils will be studied care- 
fully while in school in order that as accurate a judgment of them may be formed as is 
possible. 
Day continuation education. —Continuation education in printing, sheet-metal work, 
and electrical work is now established and is receiving the hearty cooperation of the 
various organizations concerned. This has been developed by Mr. William C. Ash, 
principal of the trade school, and as far as it is developed it is on a most satisfactory 
basis. Local sentiment is believed to be favorable to a large extension of this work. 
The industrial and technical conference, a division of the Public Education Associa- 
tion, composed of representatives of the labor, business, and educational institutions 
of Philadelphia, has a large membership. 
Vocational education in evening schools.—The evening trade school now accommo- 
dates over 1,500 pupils who are instructed in the theory and practice of the vocations 
in which they are engaged during the day. To more nearly meet the demands for such 
instruction, the board of education at its last meeting authorized the opening of all 
high-school shops for vocational instruction in the evening. Heretofore these shops 
have not been available for such work. 
Two parallel vocational courses in the evening high school have also been authorized 
for booksellers. The booksellers’ association of Philadelphia cooperates with the 
board of education in the development of these courses. 
Vocational education in day high schools.—Dr. Lewis, principal of the William Penn 
High School for Girls, this spring brought to the attention of the board of education 
the fact that stenographers are being turned out in numbers in excess of the demand 
for them and recommended the establishment of a cooperative course in salesmanship 
for girls. As the result the board authorized such a course and it will be begun this 
fall. The girls of the three and four year classes will work half time to pay in two of 
the largest department stores and spend the remainder of their time in school studying 
appropriate subjects. The time at which the girls will work in the stores will be 
during rush hours, so that regular salesmen who are working on a commission basis will 
not suffer loss on their account. The teacher of this class will spend her time in the 
store regularly with the pupils. 
Vocational teacher training.—It is planned to recommend this fall the establishment 
of vocational teacher training courses for the following groups of teachers who are now 
employed in the schools: (1) Elementary manual training teachers; (2) seventh and 
eighth grade shop teachers; and (3) special class teachers (for backward and otherwise 
handicapped pupils).

PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION? 279 
DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, UNIVERSITY 
OF INDIANA. 
The third State university to employ a specialist to deal with the 
problems of vocational education is the University of Indiana, 
Bloomington, Ind., which created a department in the school of 
education and called to its head Prof. Robert J. Leonard. Prof. 
Leonard began his work by giving courses in the summer session of 
1914. : 
DIRECTOR OF CONTINUATION SCHOOL FOR TRADES TEACHERS, MIL- 
WAUKEE, WIS. 
The organization of a three-year night school course for the training 
of employed mechanics as teachers of trades for industrial schools is 
noted elsewhere in this chapter. The director in charge is Prof. 
Wilson H. Henderson, extension division, University of Wisconsin. 
SPECIALIST IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, UNITED STATES BUREAU OF 
EDUCATION, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
The second session of the Sixty-third Congress voted an increase in 
the appropriation for the Bureau of Education, and from the funds 
thus made available the position of specialist in vocational education 
was established. The activities contemplated in this connection 
include a study of the problems of vocational education, the conduct 
of investigations likely to prove of service to the schools, and the 
giving of advice and assistance wherever possible. 
7. ACHIEVEMENTS IN TYPICAL CENTERS. 
In addition to reports from cities presented in other sections of 
this chapter, it is proposed now to sketch briefly the year’s progress 
in the ‘‘new education” in a few selected communities, in order to 
call attention to specific phases of the movement. This is done with 
full knowledge that there are numerous other experiments that ought 
to be described, if space permitted, and many other cities that ought 
to be mentioned. 
The special problems of the smaller cities have not as yet received 
the attention that they deserve.t It is believed that a recognition of 
the importance of this field and well-directed efforts to cultivate it 
will characterize the development of vocational education in the 
immediate future. 
BOISE, IDAHO. 
Boise has been selected as one of the communities for consideration 
because of the interesting and suggestive means that have been 
adopted to bring the school life and community life as close together 
  
1See ch. 4 of this report. 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  280 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
as possible. Without entering into the details of organization, 
attention may be called to the fact that since the introduction of a 
rather flexible eleetive system, and vocational courses, the enrollment 
in the high school has more than doubled in four years, while the 
total school enrollment has increased only 25 per cent in the same 
period. The experience of other cities has been duplicated in Boise, 
in that the increase in enrollment due, in part at least, to the intro- 
duction of vocational courses, has been accompanied by a material 
increase in the enrollment in the so-called cultural subjects. 
That is, it seems to be fairly demonstrated that young people are 
not drawn away in any considerable numbers from the pursuit of 
the traditional courses, but that the new vocational courses appeal 
to a clientele that the schools have not hitherto served. The extent 
to which this is so and the significance of the facts, whatever they 
are, constitute a very important problem for further study. 
The special courses offered in the Boise schools and the methods 
employed in the effort to keep the work on a practical basis may be 
deseribed as follows: 
Commercial course.—N ine units of work are offered, and the work is made as prac- 
tical as possible. Pupils take charge of the purchase, sale, and distribution of all 
high-school textbooks and supplies, and have charge of the accounts of all school 
organizations, laboratories, and the cafeteria. Pupils also do practical work in busi- 
ness offices in the community and receive school credit therefor. This department 
produces the circular letters for the superintendent, special teachers, and super- 
visors; pupils also do all the stenographic work for the principal of the high school 
and help with many of the school records. 
Manual training —Begins in the seventh grade and includes a certain amount 
of prescribed work, supplemented by opportunities for individual initiative. There 
are three courses in the hizh school: Joinery, cabinetmaking, and concrete and 
cement construction. Many practical projects are undertaken, such as construc- 
tion of cabinets, tables, and other equipment for the cooking laboratories, drafting 
rooms, and commercial rooms. Boys have helped to do much of the concrete work 
about the high-school building. School credit is given for work done away from 
the school, after inspection by the instructor. 
Pupils have constructed concrete flumes and head gates for the school farm, besides 
culverts and drinking troughs. The school board has purchased a 40-acre lot, which 
the boys are improving for a school playground and park. This work includes con- 
crete fence posts, benches, and curbing for the cinder track. The annual per captta 
cost of this department is reported as $2.20. 
Household arts.—The course includes two years of cooking and two years of sewing, 
classes meeting for 80-minute periods five times per week. The girls manage the cafe- 
teria, and frequently serve lunches and dinners for various school functions. Visits 
are made to butcher shops and other sources of production and distribution of food 
supplies, making a special study of the problems of sanitation, economy in buying, 
and the like. 
In the sewing and milinery department many girls make their own clothing and 
hats. It is reported that the department stores have complained that too many girls 
are making hats instead of buying them. 
Drafting.—The courses in mechanical drawing are similar to those found elsewhere. 
The course in architectural drafting has been responsible for producing complete sets
-P-A-G-E-319
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 281 
of blue prints and specifications for a number of houses which have been built in 
Boise. Two of the public school buildings were designed by the department and 
all necessary blue prints and specifications drawn by the boys, thus saving the cost 
of the architect on about $70,000 of construction. It is doubtful if this particular fea- 
ture of the work can be commended for all small communities, as the amount saved 
in architect’s fees might easily be dissipated in uneconomical or defective construc- 
tion without the facts being discovered until too late. If an instructor is available 
who has had practical building experience, and who can assume the responsibility 
involved, the plan has many advantages and attractions. 
Agriculture—The aim of the four years’ course is to train definitely for the farm 
by giving actual practice in farm operations. A special chemical laboratory for 
agriculture is provided. Students bring samples of soil from their home farm for 
analysis. The courses offered include: Farm crops, farm soils, farm mechanics, 
horticulture, farm animals, farm chemistry. 
Since Boise is an important distributing center for agricultural implements, a plan 
has been developed by which boys from the high school conduct field demonstrations 
of farm machinery for prospective purchasers. 
The school board owns some stock, and a dairy association has been organized 
with a membership of about 50 owners of dairy cows. The boys test several hundred. 
cows each month, keep records of food and milk production, and make regular reports. 
Several farm surveys have been made to determine the phases of farm work that 
are practicable. 
Tn various other ways that might be mentioned the public schools of Boise seem to be 
rendering practical community service in addition to what has been the traditional 
work of the schools—teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic—and there is evidence 
that the fundamentals are not suffering because of the awakening interest in the new 
lines of effort. 
SPRINGFIELD, MASS. 
The Springfield school system is facing the problem of meeting the 
wide range of demands that are being made on it in the field of 
manual and vocational training. The present organization includes: 
1. Handwork in the first five grades for boys and girls, part of which is an industrial 
trade, as illustrated in the studies of transportation, small house building, cement 
block work, and block printing. 
2. Special handwork for the feeble-minded classes, taking into account the personal” 
interest and pathological needs. 
3. Special handwork for retarded groups, as suggested by special interest, and 
offering direct application to the fundamental studies. 
4, Manual training for grammar-school boys in the sixth to ninth grades, inclusive 
(Springfield has the nine-grade system), having a strong industrial tendency and 
showing a relation to the activities of the city. Some of the projects are: Small house 
frames, derricks, bridges, cement work, the telegraph, and printing. 
5. Practical arts or prevocational work to groups of boys and girls 12 years of age and 
over who for various reasons can not complete their schooling and presumably will 
profit by the course. The morning is devoted to classroom work, and the afternoon 
to the active or prevocational work. One teacher has charge of both kinds of work, 
and uses the experience of the afternoon work to vitalize the morning classroom work. 
In the afternoon, the boys have experiences with a variety of trades, each trade fur- 
nishing work from six to ten weeks. These experiences consist of carpentry needed 
about the school building, cement work in the building or about the yard, school fur- 
niture made with the aid of jigs, electrical wiring in the building, and printing for 
their own and other schools. It is intended that gardening and some simple business   
 
-P-A-G-E-320
    282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
experience be included. Specialists are called in from different trades, as occasion 
demands, to give the children contact with people actually in the trades who can keep 
work within practical bounds. These experiences offer many opportunities to the 
teacher in applying the classroom work. Arithmetic and English may be made to 
deal with all of these activities; history with electrical work and printing; and 
geography with cementing, woodwork, and electrical work. The training, of course, 
offers special opportunities in the English work. These practical arts groups are not 
considered as feeders to the vocational school, but are conducted as distinct educa- 
tional units. There are several modifications of this plan in operation in different 
parts of the city, each adapted to the practical needs of the locality. Groups of 
girls are to be organized on the same basis as the boys’ groups, with such activities as 
cooking, nursing, sewing, and homekeeping, bringing in a specialist when occasion 
demands. 
6. The vocational school is a trade-training school, admitting boys 14 years of age 
or over who have reached the seventh or a higher grade. There are three-year courses 
in carpentry, pattern making, machine work, and printing. A half-time agricultural 
~ course has been organized. Pupils in this department assume their regular school 
cwork for the morning session, and give their afternoons to the agricultural work. The 
vocational-school boy must select his trade before entering. Attendance for the past 
year reached 110. The school is organized on the project basis, the experience of each 
boy centering around the job that has been assigned to him. There are three types 
of teachers: The shop instructor, who isa practical mechanic; the technical instructor, - 
who deals with the related subjects, as shop arithmetic, drawing, etc.; and the aca- 
demic teacher. Each job which the boy undertakes is attacked in the following 
order: 
. Making sketches in the shop. 
. Working drawings. 
. Writing specifications. 
Writing out estimates. 
Filling out operation sheets. 
Doing the job in the shop. 
. Making out cost records to compare with estimates. 
. Writing complete shop notes. 
The job is continued six hours a day untilit is completed. These steps follow each 
other in order, without regard to the school program or schedule, although a record is 
kept of the time taken for each step. To supplement these individual experiences, 
the boys are scheduled for two half days per week in the classroom for courses in 
industrial history, industrial geography, English, shop mathematics, and citizenship 
studies. The boys spend one-half of their school time in the shop. The job scheme 
has proven to be far more efficient than the usual correlation scheme for establishing 
true relationship between the shop and the nonshop work. The situations about 
which the boy writes and estimates are real and are a part of his own experience. 
The kind of job given the boys has an important bearing on the success of trade train- 
ing courses. No exercises or models are placed in the shop; each job is something 
that is wanted either in the vocational school, in another school, or to meet a cash 
order. Rarely does the boy make something for himself. His interest is in the doing 
of the job. 
An effort is made to determine what are the most effective methods of starting 
beginners in the different trades. The method of giving exercises or models involving 
fundamental processes has been discarded. _In 1912 the machine-shop department 
experimented with beginners by giving them operative work in turning out quantities 
of pieces, using jigs and fixtures in the process. The tests that were made indicated 
that the boys who had had this experience of operating jigs and fixtures gained con- 
siderably in hand skill, as well as in tool operation, over the boys who started with 
simple handwork projects or who were given a series of models to make on the machines,

The vocational school makes it possible for the boy, after nine or ten years’ attend- 
ance at school (six or seven in the elementary schools and three in the vocational 
school) to go out and earn from $1.50 to $3 a day in avenues of employment that are 
fairly constant and offer advancement. 
7. The technical high school is for boys who can attend school for 13 years and may 
be preparing for higher technical schooling or for the better positions in industry. 
For the girls, it offers college preparatory and domestic training. 
Some of the branches of vocational training still undeveloped in Springfield are the 
continuation school, short unit evening courses for trades, and part-time courses. 
Mr. Egbert E. MacNary, supervisor of manual training and principal of the vocational 
school, has had charge of the administrative details of this work during the five years 
of its development. 
ROCHESTER, N. Y. 
When the evening schools opened in September, 1914, provision 
was made for courses in shop arithmetic for carpenters and wood- 
workers at East High School, West High School, Rochester High 
School, and School No. 26, instead of at East High School only as in 
previous years. This step was taken in view of largely increased 
enrollment, and in the effort to make the school facilities more avail- 
able. These courses are arranged to be completed in 24, 48, or 72 
lessons, according to the previous preparation of the student. 
Survey.—During the summer of 1913 the chamber of commerce 
made a survey of three industries: Woodworking, machine and metal 
working, and garment making. The survey was directed by Ray- 
mond ©. Keople, of the department of vocational education of the 
public schools. As a result of the survey a meeting was held in the 
rooms of the chamber of commerce in February, 1914, which was 
attended by practically all of the machinists of Rochester. The 
machinists adopted an agreement to take boys from the Rochester 
shop school after two years’ training in the machine shop, paying 
them the following scale of wages per week: First six months, $8; 
second six months, $9; third six months, $10; fourth six months, $11. 
Similar agreements are being negotiated in the garment-making trade. 
Part-time and continuation work.—At the beginning of the summer, 
1914, the German American Button Co. requested the board of 
education to enter into a part-time school agreement for girls of 14 
to 16 years of age. Girls who applied for working permits from 
January to July were interviewed to enlist their interest in a plan of 
weekly alternation between school and factory. Twenty girls are 
taking the course, of whom 10 are working on the alternate week 
basis. The girls receive preliminary training at the school, including 
sewing and cooking. 
A summer class is conducted at the Rochester shop school for 
printers. After a three months’ try-out course at the school, the 
boys are employed in printing establishments at an initial wage of 
$4.50 per week. The boys work in the shops and attend school on 
the alternate week basis.

Follow-up work.—The department of vocational education has 
followed up every boy or girl who has left cither trade or vocational 
school, securing information regarding character of employment, 
rate of wages, life ambitions, etc. Studies are being made of the 
earnings of trained and untrained boys. An important phase of 
the vocational work is the visiting of industrial plants by the boys 
and girls of the vocational schools. About 70 trips were made during 
the past year to factories representing all types of industry.

  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 285 
SIOUX CITY, IOWA. 
In 1913 a survey was conducted under the direction of the board of 
education in cooperation with the commercial club. As the result 
of this study, some very interesting and profitable work has been 
accomplished during the past year, especially in the organization of 
recreation and playground facilities and social centers. 
A beginning in vocational education has been made by the estab- 
lishment of a department of printing in the high school, under the 
direction of a practical and experienced printer who had been at 
the head of the mechanical department of a prominent daily news- 
paper. A course of study has been organized covering four years of 
work. Two hours per day are devoted to subjects other than 
printing, among them shop mathematics, principles of reporting, and 
journalism. 
The printing department has been more than self-sustaining, 
if account is taken of its product. It has done all of the printing 
of the board of education, including numerous reports, course of 
study, examination questions, reports and programs of the North- 
western Educational Association, and other work. The department 
has the indorsement of the typographical union. 
The commercial department has been completely reorganized, 
and now offers one-year, two-year, three-year, and four-year courses, 
each of which is so arranged as to lead definitely into the one of next 
higher standing. A pupil is thus able, after completion of one of the 
shorter courses, to continue his work in another course without loss 
of time or repetition of work done. 
Considerable progress has been made in organizing the work in 
vocational guidance, which Sioux City prefers to term vocational 
information. In this work it has been possible to enlist the interest 
and support of the commercial, industrial, and professional men of 
the city. The work which the young people have done has brought 
them so definitely in touch with various forms of activity going on 
in the community that business men are convinced of the practical 
value of what is undertaken. 
As a result of this enlisted interest the manufacturers’ association 
tendered a banquet to the members of the classes in vocational infor- 
mation, at which time there was presented a full discussion of what 
Sioux City is doing and the requirements and conditions for success 
in the various departments of industrial and commercial effort. 
This was followed, a little later, by a banquet given by the commer- 
cial club to representative students from all the schools of the city, 
with the same general purpose. 
The installation of the shops in the new high-school building was 
made the occasion of reorganization and enlargement of the work in  
-P-A-G-E-324
  286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
manual training. It is the intention of the board of education to 
develop this work along lines more definitely practical and educa- 
tional than has been the case hitherto. The equipment has been 
carefully planned, and is quite complete for the purpose. 
A thoroughly practical woodworking man has been put in charge 
of the shops, in order that the work may be in accordance with the 
procedure in industrial shops. Some of the practical problems under- 
taken include: Dining tables for use in the cafeteria, stools, book- 
cases, kindergarten tables, sand tables, and the like. Metal shops 
are to be developed later on similar lines. 
The domestic science in the high school has been reorganized, also, 
and the course now requires two years of work in the grades for 
entrance. The problems for study in the high school deal with the 
scientific values of food, the cost of living, dietetics, home nursing, 
and other allied topics. Girls may now take special courses in 
household chemistry and household physics. 
Continuation classes in salesmanship have been organized for 
department store clerks. In conjunction with the State University 
of Iowa, night school courses will be offered in gas engines, carpentry, 
shop mathematics, and other branches for which there may be 
demand. 
CINCINNATI, OHIO. 
Cincinnati has probably received its share of attention from the 
public by reason of the important educational experiments that have 
been conducted there during the past few years by the public school 
department, the University of Cincinnati, and other agencies. Nev- 
ertheless, it may be worth while to note briefly a few significant 
points. 
Continuation school—Three quite distinct forms of continuation 
schools have been developed in Cincinnati: (1) The apprentice school 
for machinists’ and printers’ apprentices; (2) the compulsory school 
for pupils at work between the ages of 14 and 16 who have not com- 
pleted the eighth grade; (3) voluntary classes for mothers and young 
women. 
The compulsory continuation school was organized in 1911, an 
attendance of four hours a week being required of all pupils at work 
between the ages of 14 and 16, until the completion of the eighth 
grade. Subsequent legislation and a ruling of the attorney general 
have considerably modified the plans and organization of this school. 
In September, 1914, the school will be confined almost wholly to a 
small group of 15-year-old boys. Because of these enforced changes 
the administration is now applying itself to special problems: The 
possibility of organizing voluntary classes for young people beyond 
the compulsory school age who are at work, and the necessity of
-P-A-G-E-325
ee RO Se ee am 
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 287 
doing something to meet better the needs of the young poeple re- 
tained in school. 
Under the first, salesmanship classes have been organized in three 
of the large department stores, a teacher from the continuation 
school being sent to each store for two lessons per week. Under the 
second, considerable attention has been given to the problem of 
varying the instruction and plans of work to meet the needs of pupils 
between 14 and 16 who, in the future, will be retained in school, but 
who will leave as soon as the law permits. 
A committee of principals appointed by the superintendent of 
public schools has prepared a report on a plan for prevocational 
classes, which has been adopted by the principals’ association. This 
plan provides for special classes for children who are ineligible for 
the continuation school; the time of the classes is to be divided 
equally between shop work and academic work, the academic work 
to be closely related to the industrial work; the industrial work 
of these classes is to be of the widest possible diversity in order to 
afford the child the greatest variety of opportunity; each elementary 
school is to care for its own prevocational classes wherever possible, 
and, when necessary, centers are to be established in which the work 
may be carried on. The report of the committee recommends that 
the work shall be so ‘conducted that these children shall not feel 
that they are in school simply to spend the time till they can go to 
work, but shall be inspired to further work and higher education.” 
The report further recommends that teachers of the greatest skill 
and sympathy shall be selected for both the industrial and academic 
work. 
Industrial education survey —The eighty-fourth annual report of 
the superintendent for-the year ending August 31, 1913, contains 
the outline of a plan for an industrial education survey, the first step 
in which is to be a survey of the printing trades. This, it is hoped, 
will indicate the kind of training that should be offered in prepara- 
tion for efficiency as wage earners. After the printing trades have 
been studied it is purposed to undertake similar studies of the cloth- 
ing, shoe, and building trades, and possibly others later. 
These studies are made possible by the action of the directors of 
the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce in their decision to finance the 
survey and to conduct it in cooperation with the educational authori- 
ties. In addition, the cooperation of organizations of employers and 
and employees has been secured. The Central Labor Council has ap- 
pointed a committee on industrial education for this purpose. The 
chamber of commerce has assigned to this work Mr. C. R. Hebble, its 
civic and industrial secretary; and the superintendent of public schools 
has assigned Mr. Frank P. Goodwin, of the Woodward High School.  
-P-A-G-E-326
  288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Vocational guidance——The vocational guidance movement in Cin- 
cinnati began during the last school year with groups of eighth-grade 
teachers who have been studying the question, and the teachers of 
Woodward High School who have been experimenting with it in its 
relation to high-school students. 
Those who have given attention to this problem in Cincinnati have 
reached these tentative conclusions with reference to vocational 
guidance: 
Vocational guidance should be an educational process; the life-career motive should 
be used as a means of prolonging the period of school life; the business of the 
teacher should be to direct the child to that kind of education ior which he is best 
adapted and which will best prepare him for the vocation of his choice; and school 
courses and methods of instruction should be adapted to fit pupils for the work which 
they are likely to do. 
Since the present curriculum already utilizes all of the available 
time of teachers and students, it has been decided that no additional 
course of study should be arranged to accommodate the work in voca- 
tional guidance. This instruction has been included in a course in 
civies, thus emphasizing the natural connection between vocational 
success and good citizenship. In addition to regular classroom in- 
struction, the work consist of lectures by citizens qualified to speak 
on the various phases of vocational life and of visits to industrial 
plants. 
THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL OF THE LOYAL ORDER OF MOOSE AT MOOSE- 
HEART, AURORA, ILL. 
One very significant item in the evidence of progress in vocational 
education is found in an experiment on a large scale now being con- 
ducted at private expense a few miles outside of Aurora, Ill. A half 
million members of the Loyal Order of Moose are putting a half mil- 
lion dollars annually into building a “vocational university” on a 
1,000-acre farm on the Fox River, about 35 miles west of Chicago, to 
care for the education of all normal orphan children of indigent mem- 
bers, who are to be sent to the institution under contract to remain 
until the age of 21 years. 
Range of activities—The child may select agriculture or horticulture, 
the raising of cattle, hogs, sheep, horses, or poultry, according to his 
bent, or he may select any one of the building trades or printing. 
Half of the time of the pupil is spent in academic studies and half 
in the chosen vocation. When the first class of children is ready for 
the technical high school the building and instructors will be ready, 
and so, too, with provision for higher technical education. 
Financial support—EHach of more than a half million Moose mem- 
bers pays, with his quarterly dues, 25 cents into the Mooseheart fund. 
It is expected that the order at the end of five years will have in resi-
-P-A-G-E-327
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 289 
dence at Mooseheart several thousand children, but not more than the 
$500,000 annual income will provide for. Every child willing to ac- 
quire the higher technical education will be given it, and the boy with 
a bent for farming, or the girl with the bent for cooking or home- 
keeping, will be taught the underlying scientific facts of the chosen 
calling. 
Capacity.—There are 145 children now at Mooscheart, and 44 
others have been accepted by the board of governors. Provision 
will be made for wintering 215 children in 1914-15, and for three 
times as many in the following winter. 
The children are governed by the ‘‘assembly,” which they them- 
selves constitute, and in which they make laws and administer justice 
for themselves. 
CONCLUSION. 
In conclusion, it may be well to call attention to the fact that dur- 
ing the past year there have been a number of ill-considered attacks 
upon public-school work in manual training and the household arts, 
made by overzealous advocates of what they are pleased to call 
“real” vocational education. These criticisms seem to be animated 
by the notion that the best way, or one good way, to advance the 
cause of vocational education in the public schools is to discredit the 
work attempted under the name of manual training. Some of these 
pronouncements have contained nothing whatever of a constructive 
nature, and consequently very little real good can be traced to them. 
There are clear and unmistakable distinctions between thorough 
vocational training, given by practical teachers who know through 
wage-earning experience the occupations for which they are attempt- 
ing definitely to prepare pupils, and the work now done in many 
school systems as manual training and household arts. There is no 
need of confusing the two. It must be acknowledged that the manual 
training as carried on in some places is appropriately characterized 
as ‘‘a foolish waste of time.” On the other hand, there can hardly 
be a successful denial of the proposition that the best of the manual- 
training work is just as essential and just as defensible as a part of 
the complete plan of education as anything that has yet been sug- 
gested under the name of vocational education. It can not be too 
strongly emphasized, therefore, that there is a better way to advance 
the interests of vocational education than to tear down or discredit 
anything that is worth while in other departments of the public- 
school system.

AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
By A. ©. Monanan, 
United States Bureau of Education, and 
OC. H. Lanz, 
Chtef Specialist in Agricultural Education, Office of Experiment Stations, Department of Agriculture. 
CoNTENTS.—Introduction of agriculture into the curricula of high schools~Agricultural education at 
meetings of the year—Agricultural education in other countries—Educational work of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture—Educational work of the Office of Experiment Stations. 
The movement for the introduction of agriculture into the curricula 
of public and private high schools continues as rapidly as in preceding 
years. Its extent may be estimated from the annual reports sub- 
mitted by such schools to the Bureau of Education, which show the 
enrollment in various courses—academic, commercial, technical or 
manual training, training courses for teachers, domestic economy, 
and agriculture. In 1913 there were in all 13,445 public and private 
high schools, with approximately 1,283,000 pupils. Of these, 1,414 
schools reported agricultural courses, with 29,825 pupils taking such 
courses. In 1914 the total number of schools had increased by 269, 
and the number of pupils by 90,652. There were 1,677, an increase 
of 263, reporting agricultural courses, with the number of pupils in 
such courses as 34,367, an increase of 4,552 over the previous year. 
In these annual reports no attempt is made by the bureau to deter- 
mine whether the agricultural courses reported are “vocational”’ or 
“informational,” or whether they are more or less than a full year in 
length. Such information has been collected at other times, how- 
ever, and it is undoubtedly true in 1914, as in previous years, that 
the majority of agricultural courses reported by these 1,677 schools 
are brief textbook courses that deal with general information relative 
to agriculture and extend from a quarter to a full year. In very 
many, however, thoroughgoing, practical vocational courses extend- 
ing from two to four years are given, and the number in which the 
practical course is replacing the textbook course is rapidly increasing. 
Data relative to the public and private high schools teaching agri- 
culture are given in the tables below. It will be noted that approxi- 
mately 40 per cent of the pupils reported in agricultural courses are 
females. In a certain way this is an indication of the character of 
291
-P-A-G-E-330
      292 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
the courses, since the individual reports of the schools show that 
relatively few girls are enrolled in agriculture in the schools where such 
work is on the vocational basis and many are enrolled in the schools 
where informational textbook courses prevail. The names of the 
individual schools with agricultural courses, together with the number 
of students, are included in the annual Report of the Commissioner 
of Education for 1913, Volume II, chapter 11, pages 495-516. Similar 
data for the following year are given in Volume II of the report for 
1914.

The distinction between ‘high schools with agricultural courses or 
departments”’ and “agricultural high schools” is not as clearly indi- 
cated by their work as might be expected from their names. The 
group of secondary schools reported each year by the bureau as 
“soricultural schools” and ‘agricultural high schools” include such 
special agricultural schools as the congressional district agricultural 
schools of Alabama, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Virginia; the State ag- 
ricultural schools of Arkansas, New York, North Dakota, Vermont, 
and Minnesota; the county agricultural schools of Wisconsin, Mis- 
sissippi, etc. Altogether, 115 such schools reported to the bureau 
in 1913, and the same number in 1914. They are distributed among 
the geographical divisions as follows: North Atlantic Division, 10; 
North Central Division, 19; South Atlantic Division, 30; South 
Central Division, 54; Western Division, 2.. It will be noted that 86 
out of the 115 are located in the Southern States, where the number 
of regular high schools is relatively small. None of the schools in the 
Southern States confine their work to agriculture and the allied sub-  
-P-A-G-E-331

jects. They include in their curricula many of the ordinary high- 
school subjects, in addition to those absolutely essential in a voca- 
tional agricultural school, serving for a part of their students as 
ordinary high schools. In fact, the district agricultural schools first 
established offered during the early years of their existence courses 
differing but little from that of the traditional high school, with 
two additional subjects—agriculture and household economy. There | 
are many high schools with agricultural departments in the same 
group of States that are doing better work in teaching vocational | 
agriculture than the majority of the special schools. In the Northern | 
and Western States, where regular high schools are more plentiful, | 
the special agricultural schools devote their time and energy more 
strictly to vocational agriculture. | 
A brief summary of the tables in Volume II of this report on the 
special agricultural schools is given below. For the complete sum- 
mary the detailed tables of Volume II should be consulted. Similar 
statistics for the preceding year were included in Volume II of the 
Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1913, chapter 11, page

Among the colleges, agricultural courses have been announced in 
a few additional institutions. The total number now reporting 
agricultural courses of college grade is seven, in addition to the 48 
State colleges of agriculture. Few of these institutions are equipped 
to give courses comparable with those given by the State institutions. 
Among the State agricultural and mechanical colleges there has 
been unusual activity in the adjustment of organization, courses of 
study, and methods of instruction, due largely to the increasing de- 
mands placed upon them for graduates to go forth as teachers of 
agriculture in secondary schools ‘and as agricultural extension 
workers. The demand that both agricultural teachers in secondary 
schools and county agricultural agents be “practical” farm men 
with wide farm experience has brought to the attention of these 
State institutions more strongly than ever before the need of requir- 
ing a definite amount of farm practice both for entrance and gradu-
-P-A-G-E-332
294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
ation. Several institutions already are requiring all students not 
familiar with ordinary farm operations at entrance to college to 
acquire a knowledge of such operations by actual work upon the 
college farms or approved neighboring farms. This work is in addi- 
tion to the regular college courses. At least two State colleges— 
California and Pennsylvania—require all students in agriculture 
to devote six weeks of the summer, between the sophomore and 
junior years, to farm work on an approved farm or to work in an ap- 
proved commercial establishment where such work is closely re-. 
lated to the students’ major subjects. The Minnesota agricultural 
college rents two farms for the benefit of students specializing in 
farm management and for work as county agents, each farm being 
sublet to a student. The student pays cash rent on the farm and 
receives $600 salary and his subsistence and one-half the net profits, 
if profits result. He manages the farm for a full year from the be- 
ginning of the last semester of his senior year and receives in addi- 
tion to his bachelor’s degree a special certificate. The Wisconsin 
agricultural college has prepared a list of certain farms selected by 
the faculty which are used for farm practice for advanced students 
under what the institution calls its “accredited farm system.” A 
contract is made between the owner of each farm and the college, 
specifying the conditions under which the student works. For a full 
year’s work on one of these farms, with supplementary reading, 
study, and investigation as outlined by the college, the student re- 
ceives a half year’s credit for his bachelor’s degree. These few illus- 
trations will serve to show the changes in instructional work among 
the agricultural colleges, resulting from the new demands placed 
upon them. Other changes of almost equal importance with those 
indicated here have been made in the regular course of studies. 
The call for graduates of the agricultural colleges as teachers of 
agriculture in secondary schools is due in part to the increasing num- 
ber of public and private high schools including agriculture in their 
curricula, but more to the rapidly growing demand that the agriculture 
taught by these institutions shall be of a vocational character. This 
matter is discussed later in this chapter (see p. 297). The demand for 
graduates for county agricultural agents is due in part to the passage 
of the Smith-Lever bill by Congress during the spring of 1914. The 
extension teaching activities of the agricultural colleges, such as 
“farmers’ institutes,’ ‘educational trains,’ ‘movable schools,” 
“demonstration farms,” etc., have increased by leaps and bounds 
during the past few years. However, the passage of the Smith- 
Lever bill during the spring of 1914 has caused greater activities 
in the colleges in adjusting themselves to the increasing work for 
which they will be required to provide. The provisions of this act 
are given later in this chapter.

AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 295 
There has been agitation for several years for the establishment of 
a Territorial agricultural and mechanical college in Alaska, to be sup- 
ported by land grants and to share in the appropriations of Congress 
»made for the benefit of the State colleges of agriculture and mechanic 
arts. The first step toward this has been secured in the passage of 
an act by the Sixty-third Congress, reserving lands to the Territory 
of Alaska for educational purposes. This act sets aside two sections 
in each township as soon as the public lands of the Territory are sur- 
veyed, to be reserved from sale or settlement for the support of the 
common schools, and one section in each township in the Tanana 
Valley between parallels 64 and 65 north latitude and between the 
one hundred and forty-fifth and one hundred and forty-second degrees 
of west longitude for the support of a Territorial agricultural college 
and school of mines when such an institution is established by the 
Legislature of Alaska. Four adjoining sections in four different town- 
ships have been reserved for the site of the college. Part of this land 
reserved is now used by the Government of the United States as an 
agricultural experiment station, and the act of Congress provides that 
it may continue to be so used after the college has been established. 
Among the negro agricultural and mechanical colleges there are 
several developments in the interest of more efficient work in agricul- 
ture. The new Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Normal 
School for Negroes is now fully under way at the location purchased 
by the State three years ago at Nashville. The agricultural and 
mechanical institution for negroes of Louisiana is now located on a 
500-acre farm on the Mississippi River, a few miles north of Baton 
Rouge. The old plant at New Orleans has been disposed of. New 
buildings, consisting of an administration, classroom, and laboratory 
building, a dormitory for girls, a dormitory for boys, a heating and 
power plant, have been erected at a cost of approximately $60,000, 
and the old farm buildings on the grounds are now used as carpenter 
shops, blacksmith shops, for laundry purposes, and for a dining hall. 
The school was held during the last half of 1914 on the new grounds 
in the old farm buildings purchased with the grounds. The new 
buildings were not ready for use until January, 1915. A similar 
movement to remove the negro Agricultural and Mechanical College 
of Arkansas from within the city limits of Pine Bluff out into the 
open country, either in the vicinity of Pine Bluff or in some other 
part of the State, is well under way and will probably be effected 
during the coming year. The name of the West Virginia institution 
for negroes has been changed from the “‘ West Virginia Colored Insti- 
tute” to the “West Virginia Collegiate Institute.” 
References have been made above to the Smith-Lever bill. Much 
confusion has existed with regard to the two measures, which have 
- been before the United States Congress during the past half dozen  
-P-A-G-E-334
  296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
years, proposing Federal aid to education in agriculture, household 
arts, and the trades. The confusion has been due largely to the sim- 
ilarity in the names of the bills and to the fact that the provisions 
of one were at one time included in the other. These two bills are 
the Smith-Lever bill, introduced into the Senate by Senator Smith, 
of Georgia, and into the House by Representative Lever, of South 
Carolina, and the Smith-Hughes bill, introduced by Senator Smith 
and Representative Hughes, both of Georgia. The Smith-Lever bill 
has been enacted into law, having been approved by the President on 
May 8, 1914. The Smith-Hughes bill was before the Sixty-third Con- 
gress, which ended March 4, 1915, but from lack of time received little 
consideration. It undoubtedly will be reintroduced in the Sixty- 
fourth Congress. 
The Smith-Lever bill provides Federal aid to the State agricultural 
colleges for cooperative agricultural extension work with the United 
States Department of Agriculture. By extension work is meant giv- 
ing instruction and practical demonstration in agriculture and home 
economics to persons not attending or resident in the agricultural col- 
leges. This work is given in various communities throughout the 
States through farmers’ institutes, lecture courses, one-week movable 
schools, correspondence courses, and in other ways usually under- 
stood to be included under the term of extension teaching. Its pro- 
visions are given later in the chapter. 
The Smith-Hughes bill would provide Federal aid to cooperate 
with the various States in the maintenance and support of voca- 
tional schools of agriculture, home economics, and the trades and 
industries for persons 14 years of age and over, and in the maintenance 
and support of schools for training teachers for the vocational sub- 
jects in these vocational schools. This would provide vocational 
education to youths, not in employment, in regular day schools of 
high-school grade and part-time day schools, and to the youths and 
adults regularly empleyed in continuation courses in evening schools. 
A review of the provisions of this bill is given in the chapter on 
vocational education in this report (p. 239). The principal provisions 
affecting agricultural education are as follows: 
Three separate appropriations, any one of which a State might 
accept, were proposed—The first for the training of teachers of agri- 
cultural, trade and industrial, and home economics subjects; the 
second for agricultural education, including home economics; the 
third for education for the trades and industries. For the training 
of teachers of all of these subjects the measure proposed $500,000 the 
first year, increasing annually till $1,000,000 is reached the fourth 
year and then continued as an annual appropriation, divided among 
the States in proportion to their total population. For education in 
agriculture for boys and home economics for rural girls the measure | 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 297 
proposed $500,000 the first year, increasing annually till $3,000,000 
is reached the eighth year and then continued as an annual appropria- 
tion, divided among the States in the proportion their rural popula- 
tion bears to the total rural population of the United States. 
The bill did not propose that the Federal Government should 
dictate to the States the kind of schools in which agriculture would 
be taught with moneys furnished by the provisions of the bill. This 
would be left to the State boards of education or to a special State 
board, if any State so desired. To the Federal Government would 
be reserved only the power to see that the funds were expended for 
agricultural education and not for other purposes than those 
authorized. 
Of more importance than the number of schools teaching agri- 
culture and the number of pupils enrolled in such courses is the 
progress in methods of teaching and in the character of the courses 
offered. These questions are uppermost in the thoughts of those who 
have the administration of the agricultural courses. A more clearly 
defined vision seems to exist relative to the results that may be 
expected from the introduction of agriculture into the schools, and 
adjustments in methods are following, particularly in the secondary 
schools. While, as previously stated, far too much of the secondary 
school agriculture is still ‘book agriculture,” principally of informa- 
tional value only, there is undoubtedly a rapid movement away 
from such courses toward the practical and vocational, intended to 
prepare more directly for farming. Under the influence of the larger 
number of agricultural college graduates now employed as teachers, 
classroom work in many schools is supplemented by laboratory work, 
field demonstration, and farm practice, to a much greater degree than 
ever before. This is indicated by the rapid spread of the “home 
project” method of teaching agriculture and by the increasing num- 
ber of schools using land in connection with their instruction work. 
It is indicated also by the subjects under discussion at the important 
meetings of agricultural teachers of secondary schools and by the 
phases of agricultural education being investigated by such associa- 
tions as the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and the 
American Association for the Advancement of Agricultural Teaching. 
As an example of the various phases of agricultural teaching under 
investigation, the recent work of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Agricultural Teaching may be cited, particularly 
the work during the past two years of its standing committee known 
as the “Committee on the Use of Land in Connection with Agri- 
cultural Teaching.’ An extensive inquiry was made by this com- 
mittee in 1913 in regard to the use of land in agricultural instruction 
in special agricultural schools, high schools with agricultural depart- 
ments, and in elementary schools. The results were published in a 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  298 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
recent bulletin by the Bureau of Education, entitled “Agricultural 
Teaching” (bulletin, 1914, No. 27). Further investigation was made 
in 1914, the results of which have not been published. It shows, 
however, an increasing number of schools securing land for demon- 
stration purposes in connection with the agricultural courses, or the 
use of a portion of the home farm by each student enrolled in agri- 
culture. The committee sent an inquiry to 550 representative schools 
of the various types. Of the 27 special agricultural schools reporting, 
25 reported that they had land to use in agricultural instruction; of 
259 high schools reporting, 165 reported that they had land; and of 
101 normal schools, 66 reported land. A total of 257 of the 550 
schools reported that they owned land available for this purpose. 
In over one-half of these cases 6 acres or less were available. Sixty 
schools had farms of 20 acres or over. According to the reports the 
land is used chiefly for demonstration purposes and for growing seed 
for distribution. Some land is used for school gardens and for 
producing dormitory supplies. A small portion is used for raising 
materials for laboratory work and for projects for individual students. 
Comparatively few of the 257 institutions with available land report 
farm animals. Farm animals, however, are not absolutely neces- 
sary, as in most sections stock may be studied on neighboring farms. 
In the South, where the agricultural schools serve a large territory 
(usually a congressional district), students attending must be away 
from their homes and the home farms; consequently a larger school 
farm is necessary. Most of these farms are equipped with farm 
animals, many of them pure-bred animals used in improving the 
live stock in the district served by the school. Several of these 
schools are furnishing boys of the pig clubs pure-bred stock with 
which to begin their work. 
While 257 schools reported school land used in teaching agricul- 
ture, a slightly greater number reported that while no land owned 
by the school was so used, students are required to do ‘‘home project” 
work. The amount and the character of the work varies greatly. 
There is little ‘home project” instruction in connection with the 
special agricultural schools in the South, and a great deal in connec- 
tion with agricultural courses in regular high schools in the New 
England, the Middle Atlantic, and the North Central States. The 
“home project”? method seems to be growing in favor rapidly in 
many States, particularly in those sections where the pupils in agri- 
cultural courses are living on home farms. In operation in all States 
it is practically the same. The ‘‘home project,” or the ‘‘farming 
project,” as it is sometimes called, is a definite piece of farm work 
to be done on the parent’s farm ‘‘which in the preparation for doing 
it and in carrying it to a successful result would involve a thorough- 
going educational process.”’ It embodies two distinct features; one is
-P-A-G-E-337
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, . 299 
productive farm work supervised by the special agricultural in- 
structor or group of agricultural instructors; the other is study work 
related to that productive work. Both are essential, and careful 
supervision must be had for both. As a rule, the projects include 
operations extending over a full year, such as keeping a pen of 
poultry, raising a specified crop, caring for a few cows, including the 
feeding, cleaning, milking, ete. In all cases the “‘farm project” in- 
cludes keeping careful and accurate records of the work. The work 
done by boys in agricultural clubs, corn clubs, pig clubs, etc., is 
‘home project” work with printed directions substituted for the 
instructors. In this particular case the instruction may be said to 
lack breadth. This is not, however, a serious criticism, since the 
great majority of boys enrolled in the clubs have less than a com- 
plete elementary school education. A more important criticism is 
that the club work is not done as a part of the work of the school. 
Information concerning the general plan of teaching general agricul- 
ture through the home project is contained in a recent bulletin of 
the bureau.! 
These reports are sufficient to show the trend in agricultural educa- 
tion in secondary schools; mention has already been made of the 
changes in the instructional work of the agricultural colleges. 
The Association of American Agricultural Colleges, through its 
committee on instruction in agriculture, has made a recent study on 
“required farm practice” in college courses of agriculture in the land- 
grant colleges. These institutions, offering as they do courses in the 
various branches of agriculture, agricultural sciences, and allied 
sciences, are finding difficulties on account of the lack of a knowledge 
of fundamental farm operations on the part of many students, which 
can not be fully supplied as a part of the college course. The relative 
number of city boys matriculating in, degree courses of agriculture is 
large and increasing, varying in the different States from zero to 70 
per cent. The colleges feel more than ever before that students 
graduating must be familiar with farm practice as well as with the 
science of agriculture. It was for this reason the study was made. 
The various colleges in revising their work desired information relative 
to the practical farm work required for graduation in other institu- 
tions. ‘The report of this committee, which includes a representative 
of both the United States Department of Agriculture and the United 
States Bureau of Education, has been published by the Association of 
Agricultural Colleges and may be obtained from the secretary of the 
association, Dean J. L. Hill, of the University of Vermont. The con- 
clusions of the committee are given below, since they are an indica- 
tion of the trend in instruction in agriculture in the State colleges of 
agriculture. ; 
  
11914, No. 8, The Massachusetts Home Project Plan of Vocational Agricultural Education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  300 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
This report deals with advanced farm practice, not with the fundamental farm 
operations; with practice in the operations of the specialized farm as contrasted with 
practice of the ordinary general farm; with practice given in connection with the 
college courses in agriculture, not with practice which is considered a prerequisite 
to college entrance; with collegiate farm practice, not preparatory practice. 
Practice in the handicraft of operations which constitute an essential part of the four- 
year college course in agriculture is necessary to illustrate and enforce the theoretical 
instruction in agriculture. 
Practice without theory makes the “‘rule o’ thumb” man and can be acquired more 
quickly and economically by hiring out to the farmer or the artisan; theory without 
practice develops the mind but is apt to result in the helpless theorist who can tell 
how things ought to be done but can neither do things nor efficiently direct others; 
but a judicious combination of theory and practice in college courses gives men intel- 
lectual power and enables them to direct both themselves and others in whatever lines 
they seriously undertake to work. 
Failure to make provision for such practice decreases the effectiveness of instruction 
in agriculture, and students who are permitted to graduate without it bring upon the 
colleges merited unfavorable criticism. 
At the present time collegiate farm practice is quite generally insisted upon as a 
feature of the instruction in every branch of agriculture, but it has by no means 
reached its optimum development. In connection with some courses there is too 
little practice; with others toomuch. In the main there is a feeling that there is too 
little practice for effective teaching. 
Relatively speaking more attention to practice is given in the newer courses in 
agriculture, like horticulture, poultry husbandry, and rural engineering, and less in 
the older subjects of agronomy and animal husbandry. 
The practice work is quite generally given in connection with related lecture 
courses in agriculture and is thus distributed over the four-year course, but some insti- 
tutions make definite provision for vacation practice, or arrange for the employment 
of students on approved farms for a year or more, or place students in charge of farm 
practice projects for definite stated periods—all for the purpose of giving them practice 
in farming. Educational excursions may also be included among practice projects. 
Among the difficulties which have hindered the satisfactory development of practice 
work in connection with agricultural courses may be mentioned: 
(1) Large class sections due to the rapid increase in the number of agricultural 
students, the relatively small teaching force, and the lack of duplicate equipment 
for the use of individual students, and (2) inadequate funds to employ additional 
instructors and to purchase land, apparatus, animals, and other facilities for instruc- 
tional purposes. 
To remedy these conditions it is desirable, of course, to secure more liberal funds, 
more land, more laboratory space, and additional equipment, but in the meantime 
much can be done to improve the practice work by giving serious attention to securing 
the highest possible efficiency of the present teaching force and equipment. In the 
body of this report, under the heading ‘‘suggested remedies” (pp. 33-36), a few sug- 
gestions based on specific examples are given for increasing the efficiency of the 
teaching force and the equipment of the agricultural colleges, through better organiza- 
zation, more definite planning of work, and better utilization of equipment now 
available, Itis believed that with better organization of the teaching force and more 
definite planning of the work of teachers and students, much time can be saved and 
more effective practicums can be developed, and that with some planning for the mere 
constant use of equipment more students can be accommodated in the practicums. 
But no very marked advance can be made in this direction without the sympathetic 
and intelligent cooperation of an alert, well-trained teaching force—a teaching force
-P-A-G-E-339
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 801 
whose members, individually and collectively, believe in dignifying farm practice 
with a definite and important place in the education of young men for agricultural 
pursuits, 
In elementary schools giving instruction in agriculture there is also, 
as in the secondary schools, a definite movement away from formal 
classroom work based largely upon the textbook, toward a practical 
industrial course in which children actually perform some of the 
operations of the farm. In the 17 States where agriculture is required 
by State law to be taught in all elementary schools, most of the 
work still consists of a study of what might be called agricultural 
nature study and of the study of elementary textbooks about agri- 
culture and agricultural products. The development of the ‘‘agri- 
cultural club work,” already mentioned above, has done and is doing 
much to change the method of teaching agriculture in the elementary 
schools, and as the work develops further and the proper relation- 
ship between it and the school is found, its influence will be much 
greater than at present. It is already an extensive movement. 
Information concerning its extent is contained later in this chapter. 
It has not yet reached its maximum influence on the instruction 
given in the school because, having been organized largely by other 
forces than the school authorities, it is carried on for the most part 
as a thing outside of and distinct from the regular work of the school. 
Its success, however, as a method of teaching is so evident that club 
work is now coming to be made more definitely than ever before a 
part of the school work. Where formerly teachers aided in the 
organization of the clubs and then permitted the work of the clubs 
to be done outside of school, as a thing distinct from the school work 
and under the supervision of other authority, they are now organiz- 
ing the clubs and making the club work take the place of required 
agricultural school work. They are also using it as much as possible 
as a basis for composition, essay, and arithmetic practice. 
Another indication of the change in method of teaching agricul- 
ture in elementary schools is the growth of the movement for culti- 
vating school grounds in a manner similar to that reported by the 
Bureau of Education in bulletin 1912, No. 28, ‘‘Cultivating School 
Grounds in Wake County, N. C.” In brief, this plan includes the 
cultivation of land adjacent to the school building by the patrons of 
the school, together with the school children. The movement 
started as a scheme for raising additional funds for the maintenance 
of the school. The greater possibilities, however, were immediately 
seen, and as the movement has grown the motives have increased 
from mere desire to raise funds for school purposes to include others 
such as (1) the socializing effect of the community meetings at the 
schoolhouse to cultivate the crop, (2) the possibilities of demonstrat- 
ing better methods of cultivation, (3) the increased dignity of agri- 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  302 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
culture in the eyes of the children that has come from the cultivation 
of the soil by a community gathering, (4) and the direct instruction 
in agriculture given by the school, with the school garden as an 
immediate demonstration. School gardening, as the term is usually 
understood, has not been altogether a success in rural districts. 
When districts can not afford to hire a teacher during the summer 
months, difficulty is experienced in taking care of the garden during 
the summer vacation. Under this other plan the garden, being a 
community garden rather than a school garden, is taken care of 
during the summer months and the children are there with their 
parents to assist in the work. The result has been a very successful 
teaching of agriculture. 
This plan was introduced in Wake County, N. C., six years ago. 
It has now spread to many other sections and from reports received 
by the bureau is followed in probably 40 different counties in many 
different States. In northern Alabama direct assistance in this 
work has been given by the agricultural and mechanical college for 
negroes located near the city of Huntsville. The agricultural depart- 
ment of this institytion has selected 8 or 10 rural schools for negroes 
in the county in which the institution is located and has made a 
demonstration farm out of the school grounds at each school where 
the school land is large enough for such purposes or has secured 
adjacent land for the purpose. The word “farm” can hardly be 
applied to these demonstrations. Each consisted of the cultivation 
of a few of the more staple crops on from 1 to 10 acres of land by 
the school patrons and children under the direction of a represent- 
ative of the institution. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AT MEETINGS OF THE YEAR. 
THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERIMENT STATIONS, 
The twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth annual mectings were both 
held at Washington, D. C., in November, 1913, and November, 1914, 
respectively. The main topic of discussion at both was ‘‘Agri- 
cultural extension teaching.” In the 1914 meetings the States’ 
relation committee of the United States Department of Agriculture, 
in whose hands rests the management of the extension work of the 
department, in cooperation with the State colleges of agriculture, as 
provided by the Smith-Lever Act of Congress, explained the general 
plans under which such work will be conducted. The new problems 
of administration raised by this Federal appropriation and the 
cooperative extension work were discussed in the college section by 
the committee on policy and organization. 
Meeting with the agricultural-college association annually are 
many other agricultural associations. The week of the association 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 803 
meeting has become the gathering time for nearly all national organi- 
zations of persons whose work is connected with agricultural education 
or the advancement of agricultural sciences. The principal organi- 
zations in this group are the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Agricultural Teaching, the American Association of Farmers’ 
Institute Workers, American Farm Management Association, the 
American Society of Agronomy, the Association of Official Seed 
Analysts, and the Association of American Agricultural Chemists. 
THE SUMMER GRADUATE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. 
The sixth session of the Graduate School of Agriculture was held 
at the University of Missouri, June 29 to July 24, 1914, under tho 
auspices of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and 
Experiment Stations. 
There were 29 instructors, besides special speakers, and the nicl 
ment of students reached 150, representing about 30 States and Terri- 
tories, besides Porto Rico, Canada, and Scotland. 
The central feature of the 1914 session was a course in genetics, 
comprising 40 lectures and 12 seminars. This course was given in 
response to a demand that more instruction in at least one subject 
should be given at the graduate school. 
As a whole the work of the 1914 session was more generally of a 
kind and grade appropriate to such a school, and the students were 
more generally such as could profit by graduate instruction. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL TEACHING. 
This association continued to follow its previous custom of meeting 
at the same time and place as the Association of Agricultural Col- 
leges; in fact, many of its most active members are professors of 
agricultural education in the State agricultural colleges. For these 
it is a decided advantage that the two meetings be held together. 
The question of affiliating this organization with the Association of 
Agricultural Colleges and making it a section of the larger associa- 
tion has been raised. The plan seems to meet the approval of 
many members of the Association for the Advancement of Agri- 
cultural Teaching, not only those whose work is in agricultural 
colleges, but others, including the State supervisors of agricul- 
tural education, employed by State departments of education, and 
agriculture teachers in secondary schools. The meetings of the asso- 
ciation since its organization, in 1911, have been given largely to 
the discussion of two subjects—the preparation of teachers of agri- 
culture for secondary schools and methods of teaching agriculture in 
such schools. Its investigation on the use of land has been already 
mentioned. The 1914 meeting consisted principally of a discussion 
of this investigation, together with further discussion of college  
-P-A-G-E-342
  304 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
courses in agricultural education. The papers presented at the 
meetings in 1911, 1912, and 1913 have been published by the Bureau of 
Education in three separate bulletins: 
Bulletin 1912, No.6, Agricultural Education in Secondary Schools. 
Bulletin 1913, No. 14, Agricultural Instruction in Secondary Schools. 
Bulletin 1914, No. 27, Agricultural Teaching. 
The proceedings for the 1914 meeting have not yet been published. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, 
Considerable discussion on agricultural education has taken place 
during the past meetings of the National Education Association, 
particularly in the Department of Rural and Agricultural Education. 
Meeting with the Department of Superintendence annually for 
several years has been the National Committee on Agricultural 
Education. A movement has been started to unite these two bodies 
into one. In the 1914 meetings the principal topic of discussion was 
teaching agriculture in secondary schools through the home project. 
AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 
The fiftieth annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical 
Association, which was held at the Hotel Astor, New York City, from 
September 1 to 5, marks an epoch in the history of veterinary medi- 
cine, a profession that is intimately interwoven with the art of 
agriculture. It is now more than 50 years since, on June 9, 1863, the 
first meeting was held at the Astor House by a small group of veter- 
inarians for the purpose of forming the United States Veterinary 
Medical Association. Of this group of men the only one alive to-day 
is Dr. Alexander Liautard, now of Paris, one of the founders of the 
New York-American Veterinary College. 
Some of the notable advances that the veterinary profession has 
achieved during the past half century were briefly referred to by 
Dr. John R. Mohler, of the United States Department of Agriculture, 
in his presidential address to the association. He said: 
The acquirement of knowledge in the domain of animal diseases during the last 
five decades has been constant and amazing and compares favorably with the progress 
in other branches of science which has attracted the admiration of the world. * * * 
What a revolution in veterinary thought and practice has resulted can be appreciated 
only by comparing the textbooks of 25 years ago with those of the present day. 
In the opinion of Dr. Mohler— 
No one factor has done more to elevate the standard of veterinary institutions in 
America than the investigation of their curricula and equipment by the Bureau of 
Animal Industry, in conjunction with the United States Civil Service Commission. 
While the primary object of such supervision was to make it possible for the Govern- 
ment to obtain men better educated and better qualified for its veterinary work, it 
nevertheless succeeded in raising the standard of veterinary education in the United 
States and enabled the students to obtain greater and better facilities for study.
-P-A-G-E-343
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 805 
The agricultural colleges and experiment stations have also been 
important factors in veterinary progress in this country. As early 
as 1868 courses were being given in the agricultural departments of 
the Illinois Industrial (aow the State) University, and of Cornell 
University. A year later the Massachusetts Agricultural College 
included the subject in its curriculum. By 1877 veterinary science 
was also being taught in the agricultural colleges of Ohio, Maryland, 
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Vermont, as well as in the 
Bussey Institution of Harvard University. This list of institutions 
has gradually been lengthened, and to-day 8 agricultural colleges are 
giving full courses in veterinary medicine leading to a degree, while 
44 are offering lectures or other work, either as an integral part of 
their agricultural instruction or as a preparatory course for the further 
study of the subject. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE. 
At a meeting of the council of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, Dr. E. W. Allen, of the United States Office 
of Experiment Stations, was elected secretary of the new section M, on 
agriculture. The selection of a sectional committee for the section 
and also its representative on the council was intrusted to the vice 
president, Dr. L. H. Bailey, and the secretary of the section. 
SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE. 
The thirty-fourth annual meeting of the society was held at Wash- 
ington, November 11, 1913. Two joint sessions were held with the 
American Society of Agronomy, which met at the same time. 
The address of the president, Dean E. Davenport, was on the sub- 
subject, ‘‘How will Extension Work React upon Research?’ The 
effect of the present popularity of demonstration and extension work 
on the popular mind, on appropriating bodies, on students, and on 
the standards of work was traced. This effect was felt to be such 
that— 
We may well feel solicitous for both the college and the station, especially for the 
latter, which can not hope to compete either in spectacular show or in immediate p 2 Pp 
promise with its younger but robustious brother, the extension service. 
The responsibility was placed upon those in authority to ‘‘insist - 
upon and to maintain at all cost a proper balance between real research 
and all other agencies for agricultural progress, however attractive, 
however expedient, however necessary.” Agricultural education in 
Latin America was described by Clinton D. Smith, who recently 
served as director of the agricultural school at Piracicaba, Brazil. 
He gave accounts of the various agricultural schools in Brazil, and 
also in Uruguay, Argentina, Peru, and Chile.

The officers elected for the year were as follows: President, H. J. 
Waters, of Kansas; secretary-treasurer, Dr. E. W. Allen, Washing- 
b ton, D. C.; executive committee, Dr. H. P. Armsby, Dr. W. H. Jor- 
dan, and Dr. H. L. Russell; custodian and assistant custodian, Dr. 
W. J. Beal and Prof. W. D. Hurd, of Massachusetts. 
MASSACHUSETTS FEDERATION FOR RURAL PROGRESS. 
This organization was formed at a meeting held at the Massachu- 
setts Agricultural College October 21, 1913, under the auspices of the 
college, the State board of education, the State grange, and the 
Western Massachusetts Chamber of Commerce. About 15 organiza- 
tions participated in the meeting. The constitution, as adopted, 
provides for a council, an executive committee, and three commis- 
sions dealing, respectively, with farm improvement, marketing and 
exchange, and community life. President Butterfield, of the college, 
was chosen president; Dr. David Snedden, State commissioner of 
education, vice president; and E. L. Morgan, community field agent 
of the college, secretary-treasurer. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES. 
LATIN AMERICA. 
The agricultural normal school at Santiago, Chile, is being reor- 
ganized and its activities devoted entirely to agricultural subjects 
under rules and regulations to be issued by executive authority. 
The agricultural schools at Chillan, Concepcion, and Cauquenes are 
also to be reorganized, and $10,950 has been appropriated for each 
of two agricultural schools to be established at Aconcagua and Ran- 
cagua, respectively. An agricultural congress, an exposition of 
agricultural machinery, and a stock show were held in Concepcion 
during the latter part of October, 1913. 
The Government of Colombia has accepted eight scholarships, in- 
cluding four in the school of agriculture and one in the veterinary 
school of the University of Santiago, offered to Colombian students 
by the Government of Chile. 
The school of agriculture of the Republic of Guatemala at Guate- 
-mala City, which was founded January 13, 1913, has admitted to its 
first year’s class the first-year pupils of the Central Normal School 
for Males, thereby largely increasing the number of students taking 
the agricultural course. 
The Haitian Government has made an appropriation for the estab- 
lishment of an agricultural school, and negotiations are under way to 
engage professors from abroad to give instruction in the latest scientific 
agricultural methods. In the meantime the secretary of agriculture 
proposes the organization of a traveling school of agriculture, and  
-P-A-G-E-345
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 807 
that, furthermore, instructors be sent from place to place in the 
coffee-producing regions to teach the producers how to improve their 
plantations, ete. He also proposes the establishment of experimental 
agricultural fields in the coffee and cacao producing regions to teach 
the farmers the rudiments of scientific farming. A bill was passed 
in July, 1913, establishing an agricultural school in the Department 
of the West. 
Rafael Bustillo has been appointed assistant director of the school 
for the cultivation of tobacco at Danli, Honduras. This school has 
a considerable number of students, and under its influence the culti- 
vation of tobacco in the Republic has greatly increased during the 
last few years. 
Dr. A. Backhaus has submitted a plan to the department of agri- 
culture of Paraguay for the founding of an agronomic institute in the 
country. An experiment station has been established by the Govern- 
ment of Peru in the region of the Madre de Dios River, with the spe- 
cial object of encouraging the scientific cultivation of rubber-producing 
trees indigenous to that section, and for the purpose of introducing 
and acclimatizing useful food-producing plants. Preparations are 
being made for an international exposition of agriculture, stock rais- 
ing, and industry, to be held in the city of San Salvador in August. 
BRITISH ISLES. 
As a result of its inquiry into the methods that local education 
authorities in Great Britain adopt to promote efficiency in the per- 
formance of manual processes, e. g., plowing, hedging, ditching, sheep 
shearing, milking, and basket making, the Rural Education Confer- 
ence recommends that (1) instruction in certain manual processes 
should be provided for the older boys and girls attending elementary 
schools in rural districts, and that (2) local education authorities and 
managers of rural elementary schools should regulate the holidays so 
as to leave the boys free to work on the land at a time when their 
work is most useful. 
For boys and men employed upon the land it is recommended that 
classes in manual processes should be conducted to assist rather than 
formally instruct those who attend, and that the interest and sym- 
pathy of the farmers in this work should be secured. Such assistance 
should be more generally provided by local education authorities 
throughout England and Wales, and the courses at present provided 
in most counties should be made more thorough. Local authorities 
should offer certificates to be competed for by the students at the end 
of the class; and loeal societies that organize classes and competitions 
in manual processes should be encouraged and assisted by local educa- 
tion authorities, although expenditure by local education authorities 
on money prizes should be regulated.
-P-A-G-E-346
    308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
The methods employed by local education authorities for giving 
instruction in manual processes at farm schools or agricultural 
colleges, by itinerant instructors, and through local agricultural so- 
cieties were outlined, including the duration and subjects of instruc- 
tion, competitions, and cost of instruction. In half the counties of 
England and Wales no provision is made by the local education 
authorities for instructing agricultural laborers in manual processes. 
The new laboratory for research work in agricultural entomology 
was opened November 13, 1913, by Sir Sidney Olivier, permanent 
secretary of the board of agriculture and fisheries. A laboratory 
room 58 by 28 feet is available, together with a smaller laboratory, 
an experimental field with greenhouses, etc. Dr. A. D. Imms, for- 
merly forest entomologist of the Government of India, has been ap- 
pointed first reader in agricultural entomology and will conduct 
researches and supervise the work of research students. 
CANADA, 
At the request of the minister of education Queen’s University, 
Kingston, has established the new degree of bachelor of science in 
agriculture. The course covers four years, of which the first two are 
to be spent in residence at the university and the remaining two at 
the Ontario Agricultural College. In order to increase their knowl- 
edge of practical agriculture, candidates for the degree will be ex- 
pected to work during the summer vacation between the third and 
fourth years of the course, either on the farm of the agricultural 
college or on some other approved farm. At the end of each of the 
two years taken at the agricultural college the Government will 
give a scholarship of $100 to each candidate recommended by the 
president of the college. 
The department of education will accept the degree of B. S. in 
Agriculture as the academic qualification for a specialist’s cer- 
tificate in both science and agriculture and for a public school in- 
spector’s certificate. The former certificate will be granted after a 
year’s professional training at the faculty of education of either 
Queen’s University or the University of Toronto. The holder will 
be regarded as qualified to teach both science and agriculture in a 
high school, continuation school, or collegiate institute; and each 
county representative, in addition to his usual duties, will conduct, 
under the school board concerned, classes for farmers and farmers’ 
sons throughout the county. 
It is announced that as soon as the new class of specialists is avail- 
able the Government will also make liberal grants for maintenance 
and increase of teachers’ salaries for the encouragement of secondary- 
school classes in agriculture. The payments to the teachers, how-
-P-A-G-E-347
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 309 
ever, will obligate the teacher to teach at least two years in the 
Province of Ontario. 
The new buildings of the Manitoba Agricultural College, located 
on a site of 1,100 acres just south of Winnipeg, were near enough 
to completion to permit of their use in the fall of 1913. The group 
as a whole will cost $5,000,000 and will require from two to three 
years additional for its completion. 
The new college of agriculture of Saskatchewan University is offer- 
ing a four-year course leading to the degree of B. S. in Agriculture, 
and a three-year course leading to the certificate of associate in 
agriculture. The first class in agriculture, consisting of 65 students, 
entered last fall, nearly all of whom matriculated in the three-year 
course. 
The Province of Alberta is undertaking a new form of instruction 
in Canada in opening three schools of agriculture, viz, at Claresholm, 
with W. J. Stephens principal, to cover southern Alberta and deal 
with education best suited under dry-farming and irrigation con- 
ditions; at Olds, with W. J. Elliott principal, which will look after 
the interests of central Alberta, where the soil is a heavy black loam; 
and at Vermillion, with A. E. Howes principal, to deal with northern 
conditions. Tuition in these schools will be free, and the two-year 
course will approximate very closely to the first two years of the 
regular agricultural college course for the degree of B. S. in Agri- 
culture. Domestic science courses will also be offered. In addition 
to the principal there will be at least two professors at each school, 
whose time during the summer will be devoted to extension work 
and getting in touch with the farm homes. The schools will be 
operated under a board composed of a body of practical farmers. 
An act has been passed providing for the establishment of agricul- 
tural schools at such places in the Province of New Brunswick as may 
be decided upon by the lieutenant governor in council, who is also 
authorized to purchase such lands and erect such buildings as he 
may deem necessary for the purpose. The curriculum of the schools 
will include agriculture, horticulture, forestry, care and management 
of farm animals, butter and cheese making, manual training, and 
kindred subjects, as well as the elements of sciences bearing on 
these subjects. The schools will be largely under the management 
of the New Brunswick department of agriculture, which will regulate 
the conditions of admission, fix tuition fees, arrange courses of study, 
supervise the conduct and work of students, grant certificates of 
proficiency or other awards, etc. The lieutenant governor will 
appoint the staffs of the schools and authorize the expenditures to 
be made by the department of agriculture for these schools. 
The Province of Prince Edward Island has provided a summer 
school of agriculture and nature study for the teachers in its rural 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  310 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
schools. The courses are given in the building of the Prince of 
Wales College at Charlottetown, and are of two weeks’ duration. 
An attendance of over 250 was enrolled in 1918, out of a total of 
590 teachers on the island. The traveling expenses and a portion 
of the living expenses of these students were borne by the Province. 
The plan under which the department of education of the Province 
of Ontario is cooperating with the department of agriculture to 
encourage instruction in agriculture and horticulture in continuation 
and high schools and in collegiate institutes has been worked out 
in detail. The instruction will be optional, under the supervision 
of the director of agricultural education, and will be given by teachers 
of science holding an intermediate certificate in agriculture and 
horticulture granted upon the satisfactory completion of two 5-week 
summer sessions at the Ontario Agricultural College, or by the 
district agricultural representatives. A board of trustees that pro- 
vides and maintains satisfactorily a course in agriculture and horti- 
culture in the lower school of the high-school course extending 
over two years, including pupils’ home projects under a certificated 
teacher, will receive $100 and the teacher $75. To the school board 
which, in addition to the home projects, provides and maintains 
experimental and demonstration plats at or in connection with the 
school for the practical instruction of the pupils, an additional grant 
not to exceed $25 will be paid, and to the teacher an additional 
annual. grant of $25. When the work is conducted by a county 
agricultural representative, he will be paid the grants specified for 
the teacher. The two-year middle school course may be taken 
only in schools where the lower school course is being taken. The 
same grants will be paid and the same requirements as regards 
instruction and examinations made as in the lower school course. 
At least two hours a week during each of the two years of both 
lower and middle courses are to be devoted to home projects. 
The department of education is also cooperating with the depart- 
ment of agriculture of the Province in introducing elementary agri- 
culture and horticulture into the rural and village schools. Tha 
instruction is optional, under the general supervision of the director 
of elementary agricultural education, and given by teachers either 
not especially certificated or holding special certificates in elementary 
agriculture and horticulture. These may be obtained on the com- 
pletion of (1) a 10-weeks spring course at the Ontario Agricultural 
College, (2) two summer sessions at the college and a directed winter’s 
reading course, and (3) a course in agriculture at a high school fol- 
lowed by a further course at the normal school and one summer session. 
at the college. Besides the classroom instruction there will be prac- 
tical work carried out either as a home gardening plan or as a school 
gardening plan. A rural or village school board that provides and
-P-A-G-E-349
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 811 
maintains satisfactorily throughout the year a course in elementary 
agriculture and horticulture with supervised home gardens or projects 
and an uncertificated teacher may receive not to exceed $8 for the 
trustees and $15 for the teacher; with a certificated teacher not to ex- 
ceed $20 for the trustees and $38 for the taacher. In addition, where a 
well-conducted school farm or garden of six square rods is maintained 
the grant may not exceed, with an uncertificated teacher, $12 to the 
trustees and $23 to the teacher; with a certificated teacher, $30 to 
the trustees and $57 to the teacher. 
FRANCE, 
The first horticultural school for women in France, a higher school 
of horticulture for young women, was opened in the latter part of 
1913 at Brie-Comte-Robert, near Paris, under the auspices of the 
Union for the Agricultural and Horticultural Instruction of Women. 
The minister of agriculture of France issued a circular addressed 
to the directors of the departmental agricultural services authorizing 
them to organize farm women’s clubs in as many communities as 
possible, for the promotion and dissemination of instruction in home 
economics and agriculture. These clubs are to supplement the 
instruction given in the three-month courses now operating in France 
and in the post-scholastic home economics schools to aid former 
students of these schools to perfect their studies and to give women 
in general an opportunity to procure a professional domestic knowl- 
edge. 
The clubs of each department are to be federated, and these depart- 
mental federations combined into a national federation, of farm 
women’s clubs, to be administered by a central committee at the seat 
of the ministry of agriculture. 
GERMANY. 
A private experiment was begun in April, 1913, at the A. and F. 
Simon institution at Hannover, near Peine, in the training of teachers 
in gardening and manual training. The instruction is given in two 
half-year courses, comprising in the summer practical gardening 20 
hours, woodworking 4, paste work 3, drawing 3, horticulture 4, chem- 
istry 2, physics 2, political economy 2, and pedagogics 4 hours; and 
in the winter, wood and metal work 24 hours, paste work 4, gardon- 
ing 4, drawing 4, chemistry 2, physics 2, and methods 4 hours. The 
director is assisted by an experienced horticulturist and manual- 
training instructor. The school has an area of 50 acres, 44 of which 
are planted to fruits and vegetables grown for profit. 
t is concluded after five years of agricultural instruction in the 
German Army that, while opinions as to the value and results of 
this instruction are not yet everywhere crystallized, the efforts that 
have been put forth have proved correspondingly beneficial.
-P-A-G-E-350
  2 812 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
A movement on foot in Germany looks to the reorganization of 
its higher horticultural institutions at Dahlem, Geisenheim, and 
Proskau, whereby each institution would specialize in one of the prin- 
cipal branches of horticulture, instead of competing with each other 
in covering the whole field of horticulture as at present. Each 
institution would still provide a preliminary course in the fundamentals 
of horticulture, so that students could readily change from one insti- 
tution to another for specialization. 
INDIA AND CEYLON. 
A new agricultural school was opened in Bangalore, Mysore, in 
1913 to turn out “efficient and intelligent agriculturists.”” A two- 
year course is provided the first year, including practical and theo- 
retical agriculture, elementary and soil physics, elementary chemistry, 
biology, anatomy and physiology, and farm mechanics. These 
subjects are continued during the second year, with additional work 
in mycology, agricultural engineering, veterinary science, and ento- 
mology. 
Plans are being made for the establishment of a tropical agricultural 
college on the grounds of the Gangaroowa Experimental Station, 
where a tract of 400 acres is available. It is estimated that the 
main college building and equipment and quarters for the staff and 
students will cost from $97,300 to $129,770. It is expected that the 
staff of the Ceylon department of agriculture will be available for 
a portion of the instruction work, but that a botanist will also be 
needed. 
RUSSIA. 
The 1914 budget contains an estimated expenditure for agricul- 
tural purposes of £16,638,600, an increase of £2,335,500 over 1913. 
The largest item is that of £5,300,000 for land organization and agri- 
cultural industries, which includes the maintenance of experimental 
and demonstration agencies, general measures for the development 
and improvement of various agricultural industries, including forestry, 
and assistance to peasants. in districts under land organization. 
An allotment of £1,178,700 is estimated for drainage, irrigation, and 
peat cutting. The allotments for agricultural education and horse 
breeding are largely increased. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 
In his message to the Sixty-third Congress the President of the 
United States said: 
It has, singularly enough, come to pass that we have allowed the industry of our 
farms to lag behind the other activities of the country in its development. I need not 
stop to tell you how fundamental to the life of the Nation is the production of its food. 
Our thoughts may ordinarily be concentrated upon the cities and the hives of industry,
-P-A-G-E-351
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 3138 
upon the cries of the crowded market place, and the clangor of the factory, but it is 
from the quiet interspaces of the open valleys and the free hillsides that we draw the 
sources of life and of prosperity, from the farm and the ranch, from the forest and the 
mine. Without these every street would be silent, every office deserted, every factory 
fallen into disrepair. And yet the farmer does not stand upon the same footing with 
the forester and the miner in the market of credit. He is the servant of the seasons, 
Nature determines how long he must wait for his crops, and will not be hurried in her 
processes. He may give his note, but the season of its maturity depends upon the 
season when his crop matures and lies at the gates of the market where his products are 
sold. And the security he gives is of a character not known in the broker’s office or as 
familiarly as it might be on the counter of the banker. 
The Agricultural Department of the Government is seeking to assist as never before 
to make farming an efficient business, of wide cooperative effort, in quick touch with 
the markets for foodstuffs. The farmers and the Government will henceforth work 
together as real partners in this field, where we now begin to see our way very clearly 
and where many intelligent plans are already being putinto execution. The Treasury 
of the United States has, by a timely and well-considered distribution of its deposits, 
facilitated the moving of the crops in the present season and prevented the scarcity of 
available funds too often experienced at such times. But we must not allow ourselves 
to depend upon extraordinary expedients. We must add the means by which the 
farmer may make his credit constantly and easily available, and command when he 
will the capital by which to support and expand his business. We lag behind many 
other great countries of the modern world in attempting to do this. Systems of rural 
credit have been studied and developed on the other side of the water while we left 
our farmers to shift for themselves in the ordinary money market. You have but to 
look about you in any rural district to see the result, the handicap and embarrassment 
which have been put upon those who produce our food. 
The Chief of the Bureau of Plant Industry states, concerning the 
results of demonstration work in boys’ and girls’ clubs in the North, 
that the boys’ and girls’ club work of the Northern, Central, and 
Western States has grown from no enrollment in 1912 to a total 
enrollment of 110,077 at the present time. Enrollments for the present 
fiscal year are in the following club projects: Corn, market garden, 
garden and canning, potato, alfalfa, poultry, apple, pig, milk testing 
and milk record keeping, and other miscellaneous clubs which meet 
the particular need of the section in which they are organized. 
The cooperative relations existing between the State colleges of 
agriculture and the other institutions, associations, and individuals 
of the State and the United States Department of Agriculture have 
been very greatly strengthened during the past year. In every 
instance the State institutions are urging the department to con- 
tribute more to the work, not only from the standpoint of financial 
assistance, but are asking for more Farmers’ Bulletins, follow-up 
instructions, and field leadership. 
According to the reports of State leaders in charge of club work, 
collaborators, etc., $53,850 has been spent during the fiscal year for 
prizes, premiums, free trips, etc., for the direct encouragement of the 
boys’ and girls’ club work in the 33 Northern, Central, and Western 
States. Most of this has been spent defraying the expenses of 1,156 
     
-P-A-G-E-352
314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
champions from counties to attend short courses at the college of 
agriculture, parties to attend the State fairs, other schools, and to 
defray the expenses of the champions from 15 States to Washington, 
D. C., in December, 1913. Very little of this money has been given 
as cash premiums, most of it being in the forms above mentioned or 
in the form of farm machinery, kitchen equipment, clothing, pure- 
bred stock, hogs, poultry, and in some instances a clear title to a piece 
of land. The fact that the club work is conducted on an economic 
and practical basis makes every club member a prize winner, for he 
is able to make a net profit from his club plat. 
Among the benefits to the State derived from the boys’ and_ girls’ 
club movement, the following are mentioned by one of the State 
leaders: (1) Promotes sound farming through right beginning, (2) 
prepares for our organized modern social life through early self- 
government, (3) establishes the financial independence of the child 
through his own activity, (4) frequently interests the father in 
modern methods through the child, and (5) vitalizes school agri- 
culture and all the teaching of the rural school. 
In the canning clubs of the Southern States there were 33,060 
girls enrolled in 1913. The 4,202 girls who sent in reports put up 
1,032,115 cans of tomatoes and 522,147 cans of other products, 
worth $180,420.05. 
The business men of Louisville, Ky., offered a trophy to be awarded 
at the Conference for Education in the South for the best record of 
canning club work done by a team of 10 girls from any Southern 
State. The trophy consisted of a silver medallion bust of the late 
Dr. Seaman A. Knapp, founder of the farm demonstration work, and 
10 silver pendants, each containing a smaller reproduction of the 
medallion, to be presented to each of the girls represented in the 
prize winning. Exhibits and records were shown from each of the 
15 Southern States, and all of them were excellent and attractive: 
they were inspected by thousands of visitors. 
The 10 canning-club girls of Mississippi who won the girls’ trophy 
for their State produced 27,850 pounds of tomatoes from their tenth- 
acre gardens. From these plats these 10 girls canned 29,379 No. 2 
cans of vegetables. The value of these products, including the 
vegetables used at home, was $1,179.92, and the total profit $868.66. 
The average cost of gardening and canning per 10 acres was $29.93. 
The best individual record in tomato growing in the United States 
in 1913 was made by Miss Clyde Sullivan, a 14-year-old canning-club 
member of Ousley, Ga., who produced 5,354 pounds of tomatoes on 
one-tenth acre, and canned 2,254 No. 2 cans, 212 No. 3 cans, and made 
60 pints of catsup. The entire receipts from this one-tenth acre were 
$229.26, and the profit $132.39. The best county record is that of
-P-A-G-E-353
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 315 
Etowah County, Ala., where 104 girls reported more than 30,000 No. 
3 cans of tomatoes, having a value of $3,600. 
In 15 Southern States last year 91,196 boys were members of corn 
clubs. Each one planted and cultivated 1 acre; more than 400 of 
these boys produced over 100 bushels each. Walker Lee Dunson, 
of Alabama, grew 232.7 bushels, at a cost of 19.9 cents a bushel. 
This is the best record ever made in corn clubs, and one of the best 
in the history of corn production. 
The influence of the training received in boys’ corn clubs is fre- 
quently shown in the future history of the boys. In one agricultural 
college alone there were 52 corn-club boys in 1913. Many girls also, 
becoming interested in canning, have taken the domestic science 
course in the normal and industrial colleges. 
The direct work of the Forest Service with schools was confined 
to supplying, on request, illustrative material, publications, and in- 
formation through correspondence. Nearly 8,000 lantern slides, in 
142 sets, were loaned. Most of these sets were accompanied by lec- 
ture outlines. Photographie prints were supplied to 68 persons for 
use in schools, and photograph exhibits were loaned to 54 schools 
and libraries. 
In continuance of the previous policy of the Office of Public Roads, 
nine young men were appointed to the position of civil engineer 
student during the year. Appointments to this position are made 
from an eligible list established through examination by the Civil 
Service Commission. The examination is open only to graduates of 
the engineering institutions of the country, and it is intended that 
the position shall provide for a limited number of such graduates, 
and particularly for a postgraduate course in highway engineering. 
During the year 331 lectures and addresses were delivered in 46 
States by 35 of the representatives of the office. All these lectures 
were of a practical or scientific character, and many of them were 
illustrated with lantern slides. They were given mostly at farmers’ 
meetings and rural conventions. Several papers were read at col- 
leges and universities and before scientific organizations and societies. 
The Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry reports that the pig- 
club work taken up in 1912, in cooperation with the Louisiana State 
University, has been continued. Similar work was begun in Alabama 
and Georgia in 1913, in cooperation with the State agricultural 
colleges. This work has been growing rapidly. During the summer 
of 1913, in Louisiana, 1,500 boys were enrolled and in Alabama about 
500. The Georgia work was not begun until the fall of 1913. The 
enrollment of pig-club members for the year 1914 closed May 1. At 
that time there were in Louisiana 2,500 members, in Alabama 1,800, 
and in Georgia 980. 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
    316 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Ham and bacon clubs were started in Georgia, among the boys 
and girls, and liberal prizes have been offered at the State fair for 
the exhibits of ham, bacon, lard, etce., by members of the club. 
Creditable exhibits were made in 1913 at the fair of nearly every 
county in which pig clubs were organized. In some counties where 
fairs were not held the boys held exhibits of their own. At the Lou- 
isiana State Fair in 1913 there was an exhibit of 200 hogs belonging 
to members of the pig club, and many of these pigs won prizes in 
open classes where competition was keen. One parish club in Lou- 
isiana sent an entire carload of hogs to the State fair. Prizes offered 
for the exhibits of hogs owned by pig-club boys at the fairs during the 
1914 season are very liberal, and each fair will probably have full 
classes of hogs belonging to pig-club members. 
No better evidence is needed of the place which agricultural edu- 
cation has attained in the public mind than the passage by Congress 
of the Smith-Lever Act, signed by the President on May 8, 1914. It 
will be recognized as a highly significant step in the advancement of 
the great national industry through the aid of the General Govern- 
ment, rounding out and completing the movement inaugurated in 
1862 with the passage of the land-grant act for the establishment of 
agricultural colleges. This new extension measure is the sixth act 
which recognizes agriculture as an appropriate subject for promotion 
by the Federal Government, and the fifth to provide permanent grants 
from the Public Treasury to be used through the system of State 
institutions established by the Morrill land grant of 1862. 
The act provides that, ‘‘in order to aid in diffusing among the people 
of the United States useful and practical information on subjects 
relating to agriculture and home economics and to encourage the 
application of the same,” there may be inaugurated in connection 
with the colleges receiving Federal aid under the Morrill Acts agri- 
cultural extension work to be carried on in cooperation with the 
Department of Agriculture. This work is to consist of— 
the giving of instruction and practical demonstrations in agriculture and home eco- 
nomics to persons not attending or resident in said colleges in the several communities, 
and imparting to such persons information on said subjects through field demonstra- 
tions, publications, and otherwise. 
For the maintenance of the work there is permanently appropriated 
$480,000 per annum, or $10,000 for each State which accepts the pro- 
visions of the act. In addition, there is appropriated $600,000 for the 
second fiscal year of its operation, and for each year thereafter for 
seven years $500,000 additional, until a total of $4,100,000 is reached, 
which with the $480,000 makes a total of $4,580,000, and continues 
as a permanent annual appropriation. Unlike the initial appropri- 
ation of $480,000, these additional appropriations are to be allotted 
annually to each State by the Secretary of Agriculture in the propor-
-P-A-G-E-355
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 817 
tion that its rural population bears to the total rural population of the 
United States. These appropriations are also conditional upon the 
provision by the States of an equal sum for maintenance of the work, 
supplied by direct appropriation or by contributions from the county, 
college, or local authorities, or from individuals within the State. 
No part of the appropriation can be used in the purchase, erection, or 
repair of buildings, the purchase or rental of land, college course 
teaching, promoting agricultural trains, or other purposes not spe- 
cifically authorized, and not more than 5 per cent for the printing 
and distribution of publications. 
The funds carried in the Smith-Lever Act are not appropriated 
directly to the Department of Agriculture, as its funds to dispense 
among the States, and they are not given to the States unconditionally. 
They are designed ‘‘to provide for cooperative agricultural extension 
work between the agricultural colleges in the several States * * * 
and the United States Department of Agriculture.” The department 
receives no portion of the funds appropriated under the extension act, 
but these are paid semiannually to the State authorities on the warrant 
of the Secretary of Agriculture, who is charged with the proper 
administration of the law. 
Heretofore the department’s demonstration work has been con- 
ducted in part independently of the agricultural colleges. No uni- 
form plan has been followed, and the varied activities in extension 
lines have not been definitely brought together and administered 
through one departmental agency. Such an administrative agency 
has now been established for the present through a States-relations 
committee, and to it will also be assigned the general administration 
and supervision of the new extension fund under the Smith-Lever 
Act. There will thus be for the first time a single central agency in 
the department that will deal with the extension work of the depart- 
ment and with the extension divisions of the several colleges. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE OFFICE OF EXPERIMENT STATIONS. 
During the year 1913-14 the Office of Experiment Stations has 
continued to follow and record the progress of agricultural education 
throughout the world. Abstracts of important textbooks, manuals, 
and other publications relating to agricultural education, together 
with notes on the agricultural colleges and schools in this and other 
countries were published monthly in the Experiment Station Record. 
The office published two Farmers’ Bulletins, one dealing with the 
“Collection and Preservation of Plant Material for Use in the Study 
of Agriculture,” the other with the ‘‘Collection and Preservation of 
Insects and Other Material for Use in the Study of Agriculture.” 
It prepared and published the annual statistics and organization list of 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
  318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
the agricultural colleges and experiment stations; it prepared for 
publication a ‘‘List of Institutions in the United States Giving 
Instruction in Agriculture,” ‘‘School Lessons on Corn,” ‘‘Laboratory 
Exercises in Farm Mechanics for Agricultural High Schools,” ‘First 
Lessons in Crop Production,” and ‘‘Directions for Correlating Agri- 
culture with the Public School Subjects in the Southern States.” 
In addition to the above editorial work, considerable progress was 
made in the preparation of literature to be used by teachers giving 
instruction in agriculture in the rural elementary schools. These 
publications are cooperative projects and are chiefly based on the 
publications of the Department of Agriculture and the State experi- 
ment stations. 
A definite beginning was made on the preparation of illustrative 
material for use in agricultural schools, including charts, photographs, 
lantern slides, moving-picture films, etc. Exhibits of such material 
were prepared for use at teachers’ institutes and other educational 
meetings. 
Special sets of lantern slides with lecture outlines accompanying 
them have been prepared for school use. These slides cover the com- 
mon types and breeds of farm animals. 
One of the important problems which has recently developed in 
agricultural education is the question of the use of land in the teaching 
of agriculture in secondary schools. The office therefore undertook 
during the year to study this special problem in agricultural education 
in cooperation with the American Association for the Advancement 
of Agricultural Teaching. The problem in agricultural education 
studied in cooperation with the Association of American Agricultural 
Colleges and Experiment Stations was advanced farm practice as 
insisted upon for graduation by agricultural colleges. 
A card directory of American teachers and investigators in agri- 
culture has been revised and now contains about 2,600 names. This 
directory is maintained for the convenience of agricultural colleges 
and other institutions seeking trained teachers and investigators.

I, INTRODUCTION. 
The superintendent of public instruction in one of the States in 
which the teaching of home making in public schools is compulsory 
writes that— 
The introduction of domestic science into the course of study has led to new interest 
in domestic pursuits, has increased the efficiency of young housewives, and has led 
to improvement in the general health. 
These, at any rate, are the results now sought in every State of the 
country through the program of education and of popular efforts for 
home betterment. It is not that our people feel that the home is 
tottering and needs support, but that the gospel of education for 
service, as the national movement for vocational training might be 
called, includes the home-making vocation as an object equally 
worthy of educational attention with agriculture, industry, and 
commerce. . 
This education for the home has already made a place for itself in 
over 250 American colleges and universities, 159 normal schools, and 
2,500 high schools, and probably as many more elementary school 
systems. Its educational place is already defined by laws, both 
permissive and mandatory, regarding teaching for the home; by 
legal standards as to who may teach; by systems of State and Fed- 
eral aid to local schools; and by a growing educational and scientific 
literature, based upon laboratory and field studies of scientific 
workers now available for the guidance of those who teach. 
Significant, too, is the great popular movement running parallel 
to this educational one, which attempts to reach the out-of-school 
319
-P-A-G-E-358
  820 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
multitudes of home women with a knowledge of better home making. 
This movement involves many government activities, local, State, 
and National; it calls upon colleges and universities for extension 
classes and popular bulletins; it includes numerous social enterprises, 
the churches, settlements, charity societies, housekeeping centers, 
welfare societies such as those on infant mortality and housing, 
women’s clubs, and parent-teachers’ associations; it expresses itself 
through a great popular literature of books on the household and 
household periodicals; and finally, it is now taking the efficient form 
of continuation schools for home women, organized in connection 
with the public schools. 
It is as though the country with one accord were saying to the 
housewife and home maker: 
You who serve in this most significant social post, the home, are now to have the 
best possible preparation, the assistance of science, of schools, and of visiting teachers, 
that your service to your family and to the State may be the best of which you 
are capable. 2 
SUBJECT MATTER AND METHOD IN EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 
Home economics has been defined as— 
the study of the economic, sanitary, and esthetic aspects of food, clothing, and shelter, 
as connected with their selection, preparation, and use by the family in the home 
or by other groups of people. * 
The three divisions of food, clothing, and shelter are fast being 
supplemented in many schools by a fourth, household management. 
There is at present a confusing use of terms to indicate this field 
of teaching and its subdivisions, such as domestic science, domestic 
art, domestic economy, household arts. The new vocational educa- 
tion is apparently to use only terms that indicate unequivocally 
the trade or professional aspects of the situation; the terms home 
making, housekeeping, and household arts certainly have that con- 
notation. The sub-titleswill doubtless be found in the practical work- 
ing divisions of the household, such as cooking, sewing, cleaning, house 
- care, child care, marketing, account keeping, management, family, 
social life, ete. These processes, controlled and re-directed for increased 
efficiency, health, and human happiness, constitute the subject mat- 
ter to be taught in vocational education for the home, not the de- 
tached sciences of nutrition, sanitation, and the like. Training for 
wage-earning employment in the household has been classified as a 
part of industrial education; on the other hand, the more academic 
titles, such as home economics and domestic science, will probably 
continue in use in academic schools and colleges.

      EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 321 
The methods of teaching employed in education for the home 
have from the first emphasized practical work, and since the subject 
is from one point of view a series of processes, skill is a fundamental 
aim in teaching. Skill, of course, comes with practice. We are 
seeing, however, that there is here a body of ideas that have worth 
in controlling action, in developing appreciations, and thus in deter- 
mining mental attitudes toward home, house work, and family life. 
The balance between theory and practice is important, and in 
striking it probably the danger is of too few ideas and too much 
practice. Household arts has a long road of scientific endeavor still 
ahead, but the accomplishments already made in one field—anutri- 
tion—indicate the “subject-matter”’ possibilities of this profession. 
Laboratories, practice houses, sewing machines, and laundry tubs 
are essentials; but they may be deadening obstacles unless the stu- 
dent’s mind is awakened to the principles that determine processes. 
Ii, STATUS AND PROGRAM OF EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 
The following facts, presented in summary form, indicate the 
status and program of education for the home in the United States, 
both in the schools and as a social movement: 
A. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. 
1. The special aim of education for the home is to provide that 
every girl or woman who is later to manage a home shall have prepara- 
tory training therefor in vocational classes and schools, in the higher 
elementary schools, in high schools and postgraduate schools, in 
technical schools and colleges, and especially in continuation classes 
in rural and urban communities; and that every actual home maker 
and housekeeper shall have opportunity to improve her practice 
by similar instruction regarding the problems of food, clothing, 
shelter, house management, child care, care of the sick, the personal 
life of the family, the supervision of expenditures, etc. 
2. The new vocational education assumes that every individual 
is to be trained in some specific vocation or means of livelihood; 
that every woman is to be trained either in the household arts or in 
some other vocation, in such a way that she may thereby have a 
means of support; but assumes further that the liberal education 
of every individual is not to be reduced in amount, but indeed is 
to be ultimately extended. 
3. Girls shall be free to enter any vocation; and training for various 
vocations, including home making, shall be open to them. Those pre- 
paring for other vocations shall have supplementary preparation for 
home making. 
4. Every individual, man or woman, shall be trained in the funda- 
mental arts of living, many of which center in the home, such as 
73226°—xp 1914—vor 1——21
-P-A-G-E-360
   
  322 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
health protection; the principles of the selection and use of food, 
clothing, and shelter; economic principles—as of the expenditure of 
money; ethical principles—as those of the filial and conjugal rela- 
tions, etc. But women who largely control home making and who 
direct housekeeping shall have special vocational preparation there- 
for. 
These principles find expression at various points in our school 
system and in social organizations.   
B. KINDERGARTENS AND KITCHEN GARDENS. 
1. The kindergarten, the first stage in formal education, is to be 
recognized as having important relation to the home, since it trans- 
fers the child from the home to the school; its gifts and occupations 
are in part related to the home; the inculcation of home ideals is one 
of its objects; and its mothers’ meetings directly affect home better- 
ment. 
2. The kitchen garden, an outgrowth of the kindergarten, offers for 
children from 6 to 12 a program of songs, games, toys, and activities 
based on the household arts, which has been particularly adapted for 
social activities in settlements, institutional playrooms, recreation 
centers, church houses, ete. While furnishing amusement, it instructs 
regarding household processes. 
Cc. THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
1. Instruction in household arts in the public elementary schools 
has been authorized by law in many States, and is now required 
by law in four States: In Oklahoma by the State constitution; in 
Indiana and Iowa by law; in Washington by the requirement that 
children finishing the eighth grade shall take an examination in 
household arts. 
2. In the first six grades household arts should be taught to both 
boys and girls as part of a wide experience in all divisions of the 
industrial and fine arts—a socializing, informing study, not primarily 
vocational, but preliminary to all later vocational trainings whether 
in trade or profession, and aiming at knowledge, acquaintance, and 
appreciation of the economic and social world. 
3. In the seventh and eighth grades: (a) For girls who will not go 
to high school, vocational courses should be offered in home making 
and in other vocational fields. In all vocational courses liberal train- 
ing should-be continued, and in vocational courses other than home 
making an element of vocational household arts should be included?   
  
1 For example see “The Speyer School Curriculum,” Teachers College, Columbia University, New York. 
1913. pp.179. 50 cents. 
2See courses of the Vocational School, Rochester, N, Y., and the industrial courses for upper grades, Chicago, I.     
-P-A-G-E-361
      
         EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 323 
(6) For girls who go to high school an element of vocational house- 
hold arts should be given in the seventh and eighth grades. 
4. Returns from public elementary schools show that household 
arts instruction is usually given under the direction, at least, of special 
teachers. In sewing 62 per cent of the schools reporting had special 
teachers, and in cooking 96.6 per cent had special teachers; the aver- 
age (median) salary of the special teacher is $800. Of 390 elementary 
schools reporting on their household arts instruction, 56 per cent offer 
both cooking and sewing, 42 per cent offer sewing alone, and 2 per 
cent offer cooking alone. 
Sewing is taught in all grades of the elementary schools, but most 
commonly in the four upper grades, and somewhat more commonly 
in the sixth and seventh than in the fifth or eighth grades; cooking 
is taught especially in the seventh and eighth grades, more in the 
eighth than in the seventh. Cooking, when taught, is usually allowed 
90 minutes a week; sewing, when taught, tends to receive 60 minutes 
a week in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, 75 to 80 minutes in the 
seventh grade, and 80 minutes in the eighth grade. In 68 schools, the 
average (mean) total time given the household arts in all grades was 
2 per cent of the total time of all school subjects through eight years. 
The average school cooking laboratory, whether in elementary or 
high school, costs $500, and the cost of food supplies for food lessons, 
as reported by 182 schools, tends to vary from one-half cent to 15 
cents (but for half the schools it varies from 2 to 3 cents) per pupil 
per lesson. 
D. THE HIGH SCHOOL. 
1. Instruction in home making in high schools has been authorized 
by law in many States, and in due time will doubtless be required. 
2. Household vocational training should be developed to the degree 
of wage-earning efficiency, even if consciously intended for home use 
only, and should be offered along with other vocational courses for 
girls; in such courses liberal training should be included. 
3. Required home-making instruction should appear as an element 
in all high-school courses: (w) An economic, social, and health course 
for boys and girls alike (at least a half-year course); (6) an additional 
technical course in household processes, one-half year as a minimum, 
required of girls who have not had such training. 
4. Additional elective courses in home making should be open to 
students in college-preparatory, commercial, and other curricula of 
the high school. ; 
5. Many high schools that do not have special teachers of house- 
hold arts offer applied-science courses related to the household in their 
chemistry, physics, and biology departments; e. g., household sani- 
tation, household chemistry, household physics, applied biology (food 
sanitation), for which a number of excellent texts are now available;
-P-A-G-E-362
   
    324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
and the economics of the household, for which adequate material is 
at hand. 
6. Private secondary schools for girls have in many instances 
offered courses in home making, and in three instances, at least, private 
schools of household arts have been established in this field. 
7. Recognition of high-school household science and arts for college 
admission has been given by 79 colleges and universities; the North- 
Central Association of Colleges has made a formal statement of credit 
units in this field. The tendency is toward recognition for a limited 
amount by all institutions. 
8. Returns from public high schools indicate that 1,345 high schools 
gave instruction in home economics to 66,914 students in 1913. Of 
this number, 370 were boys who took such courses in 57 different high 
schools. In 1914 fully 2,500 high schools offered instruction. 
In 288 high schools reporting details of their courses in household 
arts, the average (mean) amount of instruction offered is 315 to 320 
hours; one-fifth of the high schools so reporting offer a four-year 
course in home economics; 13.9 per cent require one or more courses 
in household arts; in high schools offering only elective courses in 
household arts the average (mean) percentage of students electing 
the courses is 33 to 35 per cent; in 68 per cent of the high schools 
reporting there are no departmental divisions in the teaching of house- 
hold arts; 59 per cent of the schools reporting state that there is 
cooperation between other departments (chemistry, physics, art, etc.) 
and the household arts department. 
E. RURAL SCHOOLS. 
1. Many district rural schools, without formal household arts les- 
sons, are furnishing instruction in food selection and preparation in 
connection with a warm dish prepared at noon to supplement the 
children’s cold luncheon.? 
2. Lessons on food, shelter, clothing, sanitation, expenditures, 
decoration, child care, etc., may be introduced into the ‘‘general 
lessons”’ of the district school. 
3. The consolidation of district schools makes it possible to pro- 
vide programs of agricultural and home-economics education in the 
stronger central schools resulting. 
4, The home-making clubs for girls have been successfully affili- 
ated with district schools (for example, those directed by the Kansas 
State College, Manhattan, Kans.), and similarly the tomato-canning,   
1For example, food instruction in biology courses, Mr. Rexford, Erasmus Hall High School, Brooklyn, 
N. Y.; household physics, Berlin, N. H.; applied chemistry, Hollywood High School, Los Angeles, Cal. 
2The Washington State Normal School requires of every intending rural teacher a brief cookery course on 
the warm school lunch.    
-P-A-G-E-363
  EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 325 
poultry, and other clubs which train in supplementary household 
vocations for farm girls are coming under the direction of the rural 
school. 
F. TEACHING HOUSEHOLD ARTS WITHOUT A SPECIAL TEACHER. 
1. The giving of credit by the school for household work done by 
the pupil at home, on reports furnished by parents, is a device oper- 
ating successfully thus far in many communities to increase interest 
in the household arts. It may be organized, of course, with or with- 
out accompanying formal household arts teaching. 
2. Women’s clubs in many communities have organized the teach- 
ing of sewing or cooking outside the school curriculum, either by 
the members giving lessons or by the clubs providing a teacher, and 
in this way they have often brought about such teaching within the 
- school. 
3. The ‘‘Crete plan” of domestic science? involves the use of home 
women as teachers; each of a group agrees to teach a definite food 
lesson on definite days, perhaps once a month, to groups of high- 
school girls who come to her home; each teacher becomes respon- 
sible for some one lesson, as bread, cake, etc., and the pupils come 
to observe her demonstration, take notes, and practice in their own 
homes, reporting results. 
G. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION LAWS AND THE HOME. 
1. Special legal authorization has now been given in a number of 
States for courses and schools to train for vocations (Illinois, In- 
diana, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and 
Wisconsin). Home making is recognized in these laws as a vocation 
equal in importance to industry, commerce, and agriculture. 
2. The unpaid worker in her own family, housewife or other mem- 
ber of the group, is given equal advantages under these laws with 
the wage-earning domestic employee; and there is recognition of 
the need that the wage-earning woman in industry and commerce 
receive training not only for her wage-earning employment, but also, 
without prejudice, for her ‘‘second vocation” of home making. 
3. Vocational home-making classes and schools of various types 
are authorized by these laws: Continuation classes for housewives 
and home makers, for domestic employees, and for wage-earning 
women in other fields of employment; prevocational classes in the 
seventh and eighth grades; general industrial or vocational schools; 
and schools for home making on the high-school level.

  326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
4. Vocational guidance is a part of the program, and as regards 
home making it must take account of the period when the home- 
making motive is yet dormant, but when such training, if given, will 
have later social consequence, as well as take account of the subse- 
quent period when the home-making motive is conscious. 
5. These laws provide for State grants toward the cost of voca- 
tional classes and schools, including home-making classes, and also 
for expert supervision afforded by the State in the establishment and 
administration of such instruction. j 
6. Special provision has been made for training vocational teach- 
ers in State normal schools. 
H. AID FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT IN THE TEACHING OF HOME 
MAKING. 
1. A State supervisor of the teaching of household arts should be 
provided under each State department of education to visit local 
schools, aid in the introduction of the new subject, the planning of 
equipment and course of study, the accrediting of work to colleges 
and universities, etc. Six States already have such supervision by 
specialists in home-making education: Illinois has a high-school 
inspector sent by the State university to determine the accrediting 
of houschold science for university admission; Louisiana has an 
official in the extension department of the State university charged 
with oversight of the schools to which State aid is granted for domes- 
tic science; Massachusetts has an assistant to the State commissioner 
of education to oversee continuation classes in household arts to 
which State aid is given; Wisconsin has a State inspector of domestic 
science under the State inspector of public instruction; Maine has 
the part-time services of the director of home economics in the Far- 
mington (Me.) State normal school; and New York has an expert 
in home making in the vocational education division of the State 
education department. 
The American Home Economics Association voted at its Cleveland 
convention, June, 1914, to memorialize the State superintendents of 
public instruction to appoint State supervisors of education for the 
home. 
2. Money aid is given by many States to local communities for 
homemaking education: 
(a) On the basis of local expenditure, as up to one-half the total 
expense, or one-half the salary expense, or one-half the equip- 
ment expense—usually up to a maximum sum. Or— 
(0) A fixed grant for the elementary school teaching of household 
arts, or for the high school, or for both. Or—
-P-A-G-E-365
EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 327 
(c) A grant for the consolidation of school districts which there- 
upon teach home economics and meet certain other require- 
ments. Or— 
(d) A grant, as in Iowa, for teachers’ training classes in high schools 
which must teach home economics and meet certain other 
requirements. Or— 
(ec) A grant for certain types of schools, as county schools of agri- 
culture and domestic economy in Wisconsin and North Caro- 
lina, and selected high schools, as in Virginia, Georgia, and 
Arkansas, which must teach agriculture and domestic science. 
3. The school laws should declare that home making may be taught; 
and in due time should declare that it must be taught, and that only 
teachers of certain standard may teach it. 
I. STANDARDS AS TO CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS OF HOUSEHOLD ARTS. 
1. Two years of special training in household arts beyond the high 
school, in a normal school, technical institute, or college, should be 
set by law as the minimum for the certificate of the special teacher of 
household arts. The supervisory teacher of household arts should 
have three or more years’ special training and special teaching expe- 
rience. 
2. The high-school teacher of home making should be a graduate 
of a full college course in academic and technical courses. 
3. The regular grade teacher should have some training in house- 
hold arts. 
4. The vocational teacher should have actual vocational skill, 
properly attested. 
J. TRAINING OF TEACHERS OF HOME MAKING. 
1. Departments of home economics should be established in all 
normal schools; such departments already exist in 159 such schools— 
all except 10 or 12 of the State normal schools. 
2. One course in home economics should be required of all men and 
women who are to teach; this to include such topics as food selection, 
health protection, house sanitation, and money expenditure. Many 
normal schools require agriculture, manual training, or home econom- 
ics; about one-half of the normal schools teaching home economics 
require of grade teachers, especially intending rural teachers, a course 
in this subject. 
3. Two-year courses for household-arts teachers should be offered 
in all State normal schools, and a three-year course for training super- 
visors of the teaching of household arts in at least one normal school 
in each State. 
  
1New Jersey requires an examination by a committee of practical housekeepers.  
-P-A-G-E-366
  
  328 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
4, One State has a special normal school devoted to training 
manual-training and home-economics teachers (Santa Barbara, Cal.). 
5. City training schools are including departments of household 
arts, to equip the grade teacher with some knowledge in this field to 
train special teachers of household arts.t 
6. Courses for training teachers are commonly provided in the 
home-economics departments of the technical institutes and colleges. 
7. Courses in household arts in several States are required in the 
teachers’ training classes in the high schools as one condition of the 
State grant (for example, Iowa). 
8. Local school authorities may well be empowered to establish 
special training classes for vocational teachers, including home 
making.? 
9. Vocational nonteaching courses in household arts are desirable 
in normal schools and other teachers’ institutions to train in home 
making those who do not wish primarily to teach. 
K. CONTINUATION INSTRUCTION IN HOME MAKING. 
1. Continuation classes in home making for persons in employ- 
ment are intended to give prospective and actual workers in the 
household arts instruction therein. 
2. Such instruction should be organized for girls in industrial and 
commercial work, for home women, and for household employees. 
3. Such classes should be organized at daytime hours and employed 
young women should receive a minimum amount of instruction in 
the arts of living. 
4. The instruction of such classes should be organized in unit 
courses dealing with some single problems, and provided for the 
group especially interested therein, such as the furnishing of the 
house on $100, $300, $1,000, for young people about to be married; 
the planning of meals; the care of the child; the family budget 
of $750, $1,000, ete. 
5. Such continuation classes in household arts have been organized 
in housekeeping model apartments by the Boston school committee 
for workers in candy factories, etc., and in Providence, R. I., as the 
“home school,” ? and are now conducted in many communities. 
6. The Hughes-Smith bill proposes Federal grants for the instruc- 
tion of household workers. 
L. STATE SCHOOLS OF HOME MAKING. 
1. New York State has established several secondary and colle- 
giate schools of agricultural home making—at Alfred University,   
1See the Chicago (Iil.) Normal College and the Washington (D. C.) Training School for Colored Teachers, 
2 Massachusetts law of 1914. 
3See The Home School, Ada Wilson Trowbridge. Houghton-Mifflin Co. 1913. 95 pp.
-P-A-G-E-367
  EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 329 
Alfred, N. Y.; St. Lawrence University, Canton, N. Y.; and Morris- 
ville, N. Y. Other instances are the work at Winthrop College, Rock 
Hill, §. C.; at the Alabama Girls’ Technical Institute, Montevallo; 
the State institutes of Louisiana (for example, at Lafayette, La.); 
and the California Polytechnic School at San Luis Obispo, Cal. 
2. There are special secondary schools receiving State grants in 
several States: The district agricultural schools of Arkansas, Vir- 
ginia, and Georgia, with home economics departments, and the 
county schools of agriculture and domestic economy of Wisconsin. 
3. The action of Wisconsin in establishing courses for home 
makers (in addition to those for teachers) in its normal schools, and 
relating these to the State university so that a normal graduate may 
pass to the university to complete a four-year course in home making, 
really creates a system of State junior colleges. 
M. SPECIAL SCHOOLS OF HOME MAKING. 
1. The ‘‘schools of cookery” for lady cooks, begiuning about 1875 
in the larger cities, have been centers of training in cookery for 
young women, home women, for “‘plain cooks,’ and for charity 
workers. Their important service is still continued in certain 
instances, as that of the New York Cooking School. 
2. Private girls’ schools of home making have been established: 
The Garland School of Home Making, Boston, which includes a 
boarding department with a complete practice house, the Barnard 
School of Household Arts, New York City, a day school, and the 
National School of Domestic Arts and Sciences, Washington, D. C. 
3. The School of Mothereraft, New York City, is a professional 
school for training young women and mothers in the care of children 
and in home making. 
4, The schools of philanthropy, in New York, Boston, Chicago, 
and St. Louis, engaged in training charity workers, provide instruc- 
tion in methods of family rehabilitation. 
N. THE TECHNICAL INSTITUTES AND EDUCATION FOR THE HOME, 
1. The technical institutes—among others, Pratt Institute, Brook- 
lyn, N. Y.; Drexel Institute, Philadelphia, Pa.; Mechanics’ Institute, 
Rochester, N. Y.; Girls’ Technical Institute, Montevallo, Ala.; and 
the schools for the colored race, as at Hampton and Tuskegee—pri- 
marily train technical experts in various fields, including home 
making. In home making they have especially trained teachors, 
and have produced a valuable type of teacher—one who emphasizes 
the vocational point of view.
-P-A-G-E-368
    330 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
O. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
1. It is estimated that about 7,500 college and university students 
were attending courses in home economics in 143 colleges that were 
given courses in home economics in 1912 and probably 12,000 such 
students in 250 colleges in 1914. Of 5,547 of the 1912 students 
regarding whose registration in home-economics courses the facts 
were reported, 63 per cent were studying home economics for home 
use, 32 per cent to become teachers, and 4.8 per cent in preparation 
for administrative and commercial positions. The average (mean) 
percentage of women students in home economics was 26 per cent of 
all women students in the colleges so reporting. 
2. Of 86 colleges reporting with full data as to a curriculum in 
home economics, 3 report a one-year course, 17 a two-year course, 3 
a three-year course, and 54 a four-year course, while 8 report both 
two-year and four-year courses and 1 a three-year and a four-year 
course. 
Of 74 colleges reporting regarding the degree offered for work in 
home economics, 13 colleges give the A. B. degree, 57 colleges give 
the B.S. degree, and 4 colleges give both degrees. 
3. In universities research courses in graduate departments to 
train college teachers of home economics and scientific workers in 
these fields have been organized at Chicago, Columbia, and Yale 
Universities, leading to the doctorate of philosophy, and graduate 
work leading to the master’s degree has been organized in some 20 
colleges and universities. 
4, College curricula making vocational applications of the house- 
hold arts are offered in the following fields: Home making or house- 
hold management, teaching of houschold arts, institution administra- 
tion, dietetics, house decoration, lunch-room management, costume 
design, dressmaking, laundry management and supervision, and pos- 
sibly other fields. 
5. Applied science courses relating to the home have been offered 
in some 37 colleges and universities which do not have departments 
of home economics in such subjects as food chemistry, sanitation, 
economics of consumption, history of the family, euthenics. Certain 
of these courses are offered in the academic women’s colleges, as 
Vassar, Smith, and Wellesley, where they may foreshadow pro- 
fessional courses or professional schools (such as that in another 
field, the graduate school of education at Bryn Mawr). Indeed, 
certain of the academic women’s colleges—notably Elmira College, 
Elmira, N. Y.; Rockford College, Rockford, Ill.; Milwaukee-Downer 
College, Milwaukee, Wis.; Agnes Scott College, Decatur, Ga.; and 
Mills College, Cal——have already organized vocational courses related 
to the home, and, in several instances, have offered vocational 
degrees.
-P-A-G-E-369
  EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 331 
6. Nonresident instruction in home-making subjects with college 
credit, is given by some 11 institutions, notably by the University of 
Chicago. 
7. In the State colleges and universities departments of extension 
work in home making have been organized in almost every such 
institution to reach urban as well as rural communities, to work 
through women’s clubs, boys and girls’ clubs, libraries, etc., for home 
betterment. 
8. Recognition of household arts taught in high schools has been 
given by 79 colleges and universities in their enttance requirements. 
P. POPULAR EDUCATION FOR HOME BETTERMENT. 
(a) By Colleges and Universities: 
1. The ‘‘housekeepers’ conference,’ meeting at the college, usually 
for a week’s session, for informational and inspirational lectures and 
discussions (e. g., University of Wisconsin). 
2. The college ‘‘short course in home making,’’ for a longer period, 
as for example, three months in length, at Iowa State College. 
3. The one to three day local institute of home making, with 
visiting speakers from the college (e. g., University of Illinois). 
4. The movable school of home making—a five-day local course, 
with registration, lectures, and laboratory practice, which is then 
moved on to another community (e. g., that of the New York State 
College of Agriculture). 
5. The moving exhibit, arranged in a railroad car with accom- 
panying demonstrations; tent exhibits, State fair and county fair 
exhibits (e. g., University of Texas). 
6. County consultation work under a State college, from a farm 
demonstration station—an agricultural worker at present, but home- 
economics work is projected. The Indiana law directs the county 
agents, who are under the supervision of Purdue University, to aid 
in the domestic science work of the schools, and in club work, etc., 
which has reference to home betterment; and Purdue University 
assists the county agents, who are primarily agricultural experts, by 
sending domestic science workers to the various counties. 
7. The club movement for boys and girls is often organized under 
the State college, as for example, the tomato clubs and the Kansas 
home-economies clubs. 
8. Most of the State colleges and universities publish popular 
bulletins on home making and furnish a correspondence consultation 
service on household problems, thus becoming practically a State 
bureau of expert information. 
9. ‘‘Home schools” have just been inaugurated by the cooperation 
of certain State colleges (e. g., Pennsylvania) and the United States 
Department of Agriculture, whereby a group of farm women form a  
-P-A-G-E-370
    332 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
class for home study, are organized by a visiting agent, meet for all- 
day sessions two or three times a week under the direction of their 
elected leader, and are supplied with the outline of a course, lecture 
notes, lantern slides, apparatus for cookery experiments, testing, 
etc., and a reference library from the college. 
10. The college’summer-school courses in home making, usually 
six weeks in length, have been taken by many home women, as well 
as by teachers. Notable schools are those at California, Chicago, 
Columbia, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Virginia, and Wisconsin Univer- 
sities, the University of the South, and Peabody Teachers College, 
Nashville, Tenn. 
11. College instructors in home-making subjects have served 
wide fields through lectures before teachers’ associations, women’s 
clubs, and other local organizations. : 
(6) Extension Work by High Schools and State Schools of Home 
Making: 
1. Housekeepers’ conferences (e. g., Manassas, Va., agricultural 
high school). 
2. Mothers’ clubs at high schools (e. g., in Baltimore County, Md., 
and in some city high schools). 
3. Household arts classes for home women offered by high schools 
after school hours. 
4. Club work for young people. 
5. Short winter course in home making, as authorized by the Wis- 
consin law, giving a special grant of $200 for 16-week courses in cer- 
tain high schools, to begin November 1. 
(ce) Extension Work by the Federal Government at Washington, D. C.: 
1. The United States Bureau of Education furnishes to schools and 
colleges expert advice and bulletins on education for the home. The 
home education division of the Bureau of Education, cooperating 
with the National Congress of Mothers and parent-teacher associa- 
tions, aims to help parents in the home education and care of their 
children, to aid boys and girls in their home reading, and to further 
the education of parents. A list of 40,000 mothers is reached by 
bulletins and information. 
2. The United States Department of Agriculture conducts nutri- 
tion studies and publishes popular bulletins (Farmers’ Bulletin series) 
on the selection and preparation of food, and gives information by 
correspondence. This division of work has just been extended by 
Congress to provide similar work in textiles and in household man- 
agement. It has also been announced recently that the Secretary 
of Agriculture will seek the organization of a bureau devoted to the 
interests of farm women. The food-control work of the Department of 
Agriculture under the food and drug law, 1906, and under the meat- 
inspection law, is also of immediate concern to the home.
-P-A-G-E-371
  
EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 333 
3. The United States Children’s Bureau studies the welfare of chil- 
dren, and issues, among other publications, popular bulletins on child 
care. 
4. The Public Health Service publishes popular bulletins on 
hygiene and health protection, many of them having reference to the 
household. 
5. The Federal Government, by the Smith-Lever law, has just 
provided funds for distribution to the States in supporting extension 
teaching of agriculture and home economics under the supervision of 
the United States Department of Agriculture. The appropriation, 
beginning at $10,000 for each State, with additions in successive 
years, will increase until the total is about $3,000,000 annually. Each 
State must duplicate the Federal grant, and the funds must go almost 
exclusively for extension work. 
(d) Betterment of Urban Homes: 
1. The social settlement has emphasized the home as a center of 
progress for neighborhood and community; it has taught household 
arts, in kitchen garden classes for small children, and in cooking, 
sewing, millinery, and housekeeping classes for young women, and 
by means of mothers’ clubs. The settlement is placing great reli- 
ance upon proper instruction in home making in reaching girls and 
young women.! 
2. The visiting housekeeper or domestic teacher who visits homes 
to give first aid in housekeeping, first instituted by the Association 
for Improving the Condition of the Poor, New York, in 1907, is now 
employed in probably 50 communities by the charities organizations 
and other agencies, and is being urged upon municipal boards of 
health as a health measure of high importance. 
3. The visiting nurse, whether school nurse or district nurse, 
reaches the home with an effective introduction, and has many oppor- 
tunities to teach better housekeeping while caring for the sick. 
4, Certain boards of education, notably that of New York City, 
offer popular public lectures, not to be classed as continuation edu- 
cation, which in their wide program include home-making subjects. 
5. The housekeeping center or model flat, instituted first under 
Miss Mabel H. Kittredge in New York, has been established in several 
cities. It is a housekeeping settlement in which a flat is furnished 
as a model in a congested district and used as a teaching place for 
groups of children and mothers from the neighborhood. Preferably 
it is in charge of a resident teacher, though the teacher may not be in 
residence. 
6. The Young Women’s Christian Association and similar religious 
and social organizations have conducted excellent educational work 
in home making. This work is also being extended to rural districts.

-P-A-G-E-372
  334 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
7. Popular instruction for the improvement of housekeeping in 
industrial communities has been instituted by industrial companies 
themselves, as the model housekeeping centers of the United States 
Steel Co.; by the Young Men’s Christian Association through its 
industrial department; and in college extension work, as in the mill- 
village work of Winthrop College, Rock Hill, 8. C. 
Q. MISCELLANEOUS AGENCIES CONCERNED WITH HOME BETTERMENT. 
1. The Patrons of Husbandry, or the “grange,” a rural organization 
operating in over 30 States, has, from its organization 40 years ago, 
given attention to home-making problems in its local, State, and 
national meetings, and has urged education for the home. 
2. The American Home Economics Association, founded in 1909, 
is the national organization of teachers of household arts and related 
professional workers, and was the outgrowth of the Lake Placid 
Conference on Home Economics, 1899-1908. It has many branch 
organizations and two special sections which deal with domestic 
housekeeping and institutional housekeeping, respectively; it holds 
annual meetings and publishes the monthly Journal of Home Econom- 
ics, Baltimore, Md. 
3. The National League for the Protection of the Family was 
organized by the late Rev. Samuel W. Dyke, of Auburndale, Mass., 
about 1885, to study and combat the divorce evil. Annual reports 
are published. The secretary’s address is Rey. John L. Sewall, 11 
Foster Street, Worcester, Mass. 
4, The International Congress on Home Education, held first in 
Fribourg, Switzerland, in 1908, met at Ghent, Belgium, in 1913. 
A permanent office of the Congress is maintained at Fribourg (office 
International de Enseignement Ménager). This office publishes a 
bulletin, 1.25 franc per year. Yearly membership in the international 
federation, including subscription to the bulletin, is $1. 
5. The National Congress of Mothers and Parent-teacher Associa- 
tions is devoted to ‘child welfare in home, school, church, and State.” 
The organization is an affiliation of local parent-teacher associations, 
mother-club circles, etc., with national officers. A national congress 
is held every three years. Cooperation is given the United States 
Bureau of Education in its division of home education. The organ 
of the association is Child Welfare Magazine, Lippincott, Philadelphia. 
6. The International Congress of Farm Women (Cercles des Fer- 
miéres), which organizes rural women, held its third meeting at 
Ghent, Belgium, in 1913. Affiliated with it is the International 
Congress of Farm Women (American), which holds annual meetings 
with the Dry-Farming Congress. 
7. The National Housewives’ League concerns itself especially with 
household food supplies and marketing. It has affiliated local organi-
-P-A-G-E-373
EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 335 
zations and national officers. Its organ is the Housewives’ League 
Magazine, New York. 
8. The Associated Clubs of Domestic Science is an affiliation of 
local organizations, with national officers who conduct a department 
in the National Food Magazine, New York. 
9. The National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Educa- 
tion aims to aid in securing the adoption of vocational education 
laws and the introduction of vocational education into schools. It 
maintains an office at 140 West Forty-second Street, New York 
City, a general secretary and assistants; it holds meetings, publishes 
bulletins, and acts as a national clearing house for the vocational 
education movement. 
10. The American Society for the Study and Prevention of Infant 
Mortality holds an annual national convention to discuss methods 
of progress in its field, publishes literature, and has an information 
and propaganda office at Baltimore, Md. For three years one of its 
sections has discussed continuation schools of home making and 
child care as a measure of central importance in reducing unnecessary 
mortality of infants and has petitioned the State educational authori- 
ties of the various States for the establishment of such schools. 
11. The committee of the American Medical Association on public 
health education among women secures the cooperation of physicians 
in providing popular education for women by lectures, printed mate- 
rial, etc., throughout the whole country.t 
12. The National Housing Association unites all interested in 
improving living conditions as regards shelter, by popular education 
regarding standards of housing, formulated in municipal and State 
housing laws. The reports of its annual convention are a summary 
of problems and progress in this field.? 
13. The General Federation of Women’s Clubs, through its national 
home-economics committee, leads in the educational work for home 
betterment which is carried on by hundreds of local women’s clubs 
throughout the country. The State home-economics chairmen 
give similar aid. Local clubs, through home-economics committees 
or sections, hold lectures, singly or in series, give programs of papers, 
aid in introducing household arts into schools, adding household 
books to libraries, etc.* 
14. One special correspondence school in home making, the 
American School of Home Economics, Chicago, is worthy of note as 
having published a praiseworthy library of home economics and as 
having registered some 15,000 persons in its reading or study courses.

  336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
15. The National Consumers’ League recognizes the power of the 
ultimate purchaser in the market to affect the economic and sanitary 
conditions under which goods are produced and sold, and it unites 
housewives and other purchasers in demanding fair factory and store 
conditions, by trading only with stores on the league’s White Lists 
and buying only goods bearing its label.t 
16. The National Child Labor Committee aims solely at the pro- 
tection of children now exploited in industry by raising the legal 
school age and by forbidding the employment of small children, 
thus protecting the family group of the present generation, as well 
as safeguarding the next generation at a vulnerable point.? 
17. The Child-Helping Department of the Russell Sage Founda- 
tion endeavors to secure laws for the protection of children, to improve 
the care of children in institutional homes, and to reduce infant 
mortality—in general, to better the condition of children.? : 
18. The press, which, in its relation to the household, includes the 
women’s departments of daily papers-and of religious, agricultural, 
and fraternal organs, and especially the household monthlies, exerts 
a great influence for home betterment. This influence seems likely 
to increase now that our schools of journalism and home economics 
are beginning to give definite place to training in household arts 
journalism. The State College of Iowa, for example, gives two courses 
in home economics journalism. 
19. The public libraries have commonly given space to the litera- 
ture of household management and its various divisions. Some- 
times these books are given a special household shelf or section. It 
has been suggested that, with the growth of the household consulting 
service now beginning in various ways, an expert household consult- 
ant might possibly be placed in charge of such a housekeepers’ room 
and reference library, at least in the large libraries. 
20. The household experiment station, so far best illustrated in 
the proprietary ‘‘station” of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Child, at Stam- 
ford, Conn. (formerly Charles Barnard, Darien, Conn.), may possibly 
be developed as a common agency for household progress, quite as the 
agricultural experiment stations have served in their field. Senator 
Reed Smoot has proposed a Federal grant of $10,000 a year to each 
State for scientific research in home economics at the agricultural 
stations.

EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. oT 
Il. LOCAL PROGRESS IN EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 
There are presented in the following section facts of progress, taken 
from returns made to the Bureau of Education, as regards elementary 
schools and high schools, practical household-arts work in public 
schools, vocational classes, normal schools, and colleges. 
A. PROGRESS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The reports as to instruction in household arts in elementary 
schools are favorable in all instances except one from Oklahoma, and 
in that case the objection is rather to the lack of equipment than to 
the instruction itself. The superintendent of schools in one Okla- 
homa city reports ‘‘only enough domestic science to comply with the 
law; * * -* itseems to me time wasted, in most cases from lack of 
proper equipment, crowded curriculum, poorly prepared teachers in 
this line, ete.” 
Bozeman, Mont., and Baker, Oreg., have new cottages for practical work, and 
Cleveland, Ohio, has added infant hygiene classes in the eighth grade. 
Columbus, Ga., reports work well organized in both white and colored schools, and 
a new domestic science center. 
Monroe, Ga., reports that provision for household arts is to be made in the new 
school buildings; meantime beginnings are making in the mill-village and colored 
schools. 
New Orleans, La., reports that last year 11 new domestic science centers were 
established. 
Lincoln, Nebr., has this year increased its work in household arts by equipping 
a ward building in a German-Russian district with a cooking laboratory, laundry, 
practice kitchen, practice dining room, and a sewing room. 
Trenton, N. J., gives lessons on the care of bedrooms by sending a large doll’s bed 
to the various classrooms. 
Mechanicsville, N. Y., in introducing household arts, will make it elective above the 
fifth grade. 
Newark, N. Y., will put cooking instruction as low as the sixth grade in a school in 
which girls leave at the end of the sixth year. 
The Enid (Okla.) superintendent reports: ‘‘I am emphasizing household arts and a 
knowledge of how to conduct a household in its broadest phases; I think we give too 
much attention to domestic science.” 
Philadelphia, Pa., last year increased the elementary course in cookery to two 
years, and in July, 1914, instruction on the care of infants was added. 
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., started 30 additional elementary classes in household arts. 
Pawtucket, R. I., reports that special classes in the household arts were established 
last year for girls 12 years of age who do not expect to complete the elementary course. 
Rutland, Vt., reports domestic science as introduced eight years ago: ‘‘Each year 
we have broadened the course somewhat, and each year reached a larger number of 
pupils.” 
Whitewater, Wis., says that ‘‘after five years the interest continues excellent.”

  338 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
B. PROGRESS IN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The sweep of the home education movement is well illustrated by 
the situation in New Hampshire, where 22 of 78 standard first-class 
high schools up to June, 1914, had introduced household science, and 
30 more were expecting to do so in the fall, so that the State super- 
intendent anticipates that all girls’ high schools and coeducational 
high schools will have such courses within a few years. In North 
Carolina, 7 county high schools with departments of home economics 
had been organized up to June, 1914, and 9 similar schools were under 
organizations, while Virginia voted this year $30,000 for dormitories 
at the district high schools that offer agricultural and home-economics 
courses. 
Arizona reports that 16 high schools received this year State aid 
amounting to $10,000 for their departments of domestic science. 
Kansas reports 93 high schools teaching domestic science as com- 
pared with 48 teaching manual training and 333 teaching agriculture. 
By arule of the Utah State Board of Education high schools must 
offer one-half unit of instruction in a group of courses which includes 
domestic science and art, and as a result nearly all high schools teach 
something in this field. 
Caldwell, Idaho, in the high school serves members of the local ladies’ club with a 
full-course dinner—the students planning, marketing, and carrying out the enterprise; 
and a plan is under way to serve a hot lunch to pupils. 
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has a Thursday afternoon class for domestic help, and reports 
great community interest in practical education. Daily high-school work in home- 
making subjects, instead of fortnightly, has been inaugurated this year, and domestic 
chemistry added. 
Independence, Iowa, has added a course in practical dressmaking and one in laun- 
dering in the high school. 
Oskaloosa, Iowa, reports domestic science electives as growing in registration, “yet 
elective Latin was far more popular.”” 
Concord, Mass., reports an increase of 50 per cent in high-school registration in house- 
hold arts. 
Malden, Mass., introduced a four-year high-school course in household arts. 
Mankato, Minn., added a home administration course as a third year in high-school 
work in home making, 
St. Paul, Minn., reports new high-school courses in design, millinery, camp cookery, 
and dietetics, 
St. Louis, Mo., reports in high-school work a closer union between drawing and 
household arts; and special instruction provided in parts of the city where most needed, 
in the care of the home, purchasing of supplies, care of the sick, etc. 
Barkerton, Ohio, has introduced household management in the high school. 
The Harrisburg, Pa., superintendent of schools recently recommended to the board 
of education the rental of a dwelling house as a home-making laboratory, and the 
employment of “an experienced and competent woman teacher to be known as 
matron, whose duty it would be to have general out-of-school oversight of the high- 
school girls, including personal conferences.”’ 
Spartanburg, S. C., reports that 85 per cent of high-school girls are taking the course 
in domestic science. 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
        EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 339 
Hillsboro, Tex., reports new high-school work in household physics, chemistry, and 
sanitation. 
Portsmouth, Va., has made two years of houschold arts obligatory for girls in high 
school; and Mishawaka, Ind., has made one semester obligatory. 
C. PROGRESS IN PRACTICAL WORK. 
Schools in all parts of the country report credit for home work in 
the household arts. 
In connection with the girls’ club work an effective effort to 
improve home conditions as regards sanitation, food, clothing, child 
care, etc., is going on in the 24 States where canning clubs are organ- 
ized. “The tomato is the key to unlock the kitchen door,” and 
indeed to open the doors of the whole household for home-betterment 
instruction. 
School lunches have been organized in connection with household- 
arts teaching in many cities, including Gary, Ind.; Winchester, Mass.; 
Wilmington, Del.; Auburn, Me.; and Alliance, Ohio. Gary, Ind., is 
also experimenting with taking orders for sewing and laundry work, 
in order to give real practice work. 
Orange, N. J., reports that a number of girls did work as practical 
cooks in private homes after school, and Virginia, Minn., has insti- 
tuted a “service bureau” in connection with the schools, whereby 
students in domestic economy and manual training are called upon 
to do work in homes at a small wage per hour. This tendency to 
undertake wagework in households is reported in several other places. 
In Boulder, Colo., the girls of the sewing classes are voluntarily making garments, 
bed linen, and baby linen to be donated to the local hospital. 
Meriden, Conn., has arranged Friday afternoon lectures before the housekeeping 
students, by grocers, insurance men, hardware dealers, builders, plumbers, and 
others, on various phases of household economy, to which the public is also invited. 
OC. R. M. Sheppard, county superintendent of Deland, Fla., reports that a teacher 
has been employed for the whole county to look after club work and extension work 
for adults, and to conduct a circulating school of household arts; her work will be 
directed by the county superintendent and she will do community welfare work in 
the towns visited. This is a good instance of the widespread benefits radiating from 
the tomato-club work. 
Spring Valley, Ill., reports that ‘‘actual domestic work” is done, and Shirley, Ind., 
that “‘all work has been made more practical.”’ 
Greencastle, Ind., secured equipment for domestic instruction by renting an old 
hotel building. 
Eldorado, Kans., is emphasizing practical home work: The care and mending of 
clothing, care of young members of family, buying groceries and dry goods economi- 
cally, making one’s own clothes. Credit for home work is also given. 
Saginaw East Side, Mich., added laundry work in the seventh and eighth grades; 
and in its evening class in household arts had one-half the class of housemaids, the 
other of industrial workers. The economic value of housework was emphasized in 
the school classes by selling cooked products, canned goods, candy, etc. 
Chisholm, Minn., is to add this year a course in housekeeping, with practice in a 
model apartment.
-P-A-G-E-378
  340: g EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Hoboken, N. J., in its high-school work in domestic science, places the buying for 
the cooking lessons in charge of students; students get part-time wage-earning house- 
work in the city as there is opportunity. 
Niagara Falls, N. Y., makes a special feature of practice meals in cookery lessons. 
Coshocton, Ohio, seems to emphasize practical undertakings: Luncheons given by 
class; class suppers; cooking for home orders; hat trimming; pupils going to houses 
to do cooking, including cooking for the sick; meals prepared for business men, board 
of education dinners, etc. 
Elyria, Ohio, reports ‘‘more making of wearable garments,”’ and Beaver, Pa., finds 
many girls becoming the buyers in their households. 
Mount Vernon, Ohio, has equipped a kitchen with tubs and wringers for laundering 
the kitchen and dining-room linen. 
Xenia, Ohio, reports that while it has not been possible to introduce household 
arts, demonstration lessons are given in school and repeated by the pupils in their 
homes, the parent-teacher association cooperating in the -work. 
One Ohio town has made a study of the work which girls do in their own homes, 
and an effort is making to give “‘a practical application of the teacher’s efforts to the 
plain substantial things in cooking and sewing.” 
Pittsburgh, Pa., emphasizes ‘‘practical general housekeeping, to which cooking 
and sewing contribute,” which is an instance of a new emphasis in many schools upon 
housekeeping and home making instead of the individual household arts, cooking 
and sewing, separately considered. 
At Charleston, S. C., members of the domestic science graduating class of the high 
school took all their meals together for a week at the school, the students planning, 
marketing, preparing, and serving the meals. 
Brookings, S. Dak., gives school credit for home work in preparing one meal per 
day for three months; making beds daily; doing the house laundry; also, for making a 
dress, waist, and nightgown; and for keeping a savings-bank account for a year with 
monthly deposits. 
In Box Elder County, Utah, the household arts are taught in the schools; in sewing 
the handwork is done in school, but in cooking, theoretical work only is given in 
school and practical work is done at home. 
D. PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL CLASSES. 
A large number of cities report the formation of classes for voca- 
tional instruction; in some cases the instruction is given in the even- 
ing. Continuation classes for housewives were introduced at Quincy 
Mass.; New Haven, Conn.; and Worcester, Mass. Valparaiso, Ind., 
reports continuation classes, and Vallejo, Cal., will open a class for 
adult women this winter. : 
Some of the reports are here given: 
Sterling, Colo., reports opening adult classes taught by expert seamstresses and 
cooks; ‘‘The course is great; people are flocking to these classes.” 
New Haven, Conn., began in September, 1913, its trade school, with a one-year 
home-making course. 
Waterbury and Hartford, Conn., have established evening classes for wage-earning 
women. 
Winsted, Conn., has afternoon and evening classes for shop girls, matrons, clerks, 
and others. 
Farmer City, Iil., formed one class during school hours for persons not members 
of the school.
-P-A-G-E-379
  
EDUCATION FOR THE HOME, 841 
Muncie, Ind., has evening classes for women in five centers; where cooking, gar- 
ment making, millinery, and nursing are taught. 
Charles City, Iowa, has organized winter classes in cooking and in physical training 
for women and for factory girls. 
Clarinda, Iowa, is planning a class in cooking and sanitation for young women and 
girls who can not attend school, In the regular high school the registration doubled 
last year. 
Garden City, Kans., is opening its domestic work to graduates of the high school 
and to others not in the school. 
Winfield, Kans., held a six-week summer school in 1914 for children from 8 to 21 
in household arts and manual training; the former classes were also open to house- 
wives, and a total enrollment of 250 resulted. 
In Worcester, Mass., the public schools give evening cooking classes, which are 
attended by housewives, wage-earning women, and servants; and the trade school 
for girls also conducts continuation classes. 
Coldwater, Mich., has arranged practical talks by business men, and is starting a 
continuation school for women. 
Owatonna, Minn., gave adult women a special one-week course in cookery, and 
tried the plan of credit for home work in an eighth grade. 
In Helena, Mont., household arts was extended last year to include special students, 
Montclair, N. J., gave short unit courses to 150 housekeepers with great success. 
In Nutley, N. J., instruction includes laundry and nursing, as well as cooking and 
sewing, and a prevocational class of girls from the sixth and seventh grades was started. 
in September, 1914. 
Utica, N. Y., reports an elementary vocational school with intensive work in 
household arts. 
Clinton, Okla., reports that ‘‘any woman in town can enter the regular classes in 
household arts.’’ In the school work, thrift and economy are emphasized. 
In Wilmerding, Pa., classes in cooking and serving for foreign women have been 
opened by the schools. 
Harrisonburg, Va., reports that a number of women and girls who are not regularly 
in high school come three afternoons a week for household-arts instruction. 
Williamsburg, Va., reports ‘‘much interest and achievement among the colored 
girls through the work of an industrial teacher in sewing, cooking, home gardening, 
ete.” 
Beaver Dam, Wis., offers a Saturday afternoon sewing class for wage-earning young 
women. 
Beloit, Wis., has equipped a flat for continuation classes in home making, and both 
day and evening classes for wage-earning young women. 
Manitowoc, Wis., reported that its night school classes in household arts were espe- 
cially large. 
The high school at Stoughton, Wis., opened its domestic science department to a 
class of high-school graduates, who were taught by the regular teacher of domestic 
science, who also aided the ladies of a local home economics club which met in the 
department. 
E. PROGRESS IN NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
In a return from State normal-school principals in September, 
1914, of 59 replying, 54 are teaching home economics, and 7 report 
home economics introduced in 1913-14 and 2 in September, 1914; 
these figures, combined with those from an earlier inquiry, show that 
159 State normal schools, all but about 10 or 12 of the total number 
of such schools, are now teaching home economics. Of the 54 insti- 
     
-P-A-G-E-380
  342 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
tutions reporting in this inquiry, 21 require some work in home 
economics of all intending grade teachers; 24 allow such students 
to elect home economics, and 28 require one or more courses in home 
economics of intending rural teachers; 32 of the 54 reporting offer a 
course for training special teachers of home economics; 9 report 
courses in home making; 25 of these normal schools report additions 
to equipment for household arts, and 14 report additions to their 
teaching staff in home economics during the past year. . These figures 
would doubtless need to be more than doubled to represent ade- 
quately the whole situation in the normal schools. 
One normal school principal writes: ““Domestic economy needs 
saving from its friends; it must be kept close to home needs and home 
uses; already it has been sterilized and schoolmasterized to the loss 
of its earlier worth.” He then adds: “Our school is a school for 
teachers. Any one may take domestic science here, but it counts 
only when the student plans and prepares to teach it.’ This aim 
seems to cut across the preceding one; if credit vocational courses 
were opened for home makers as well as for teachers, it would help 
keep the practical issues of home management prominent, and the 
subject would not be sterilized as it doubtless always tends to be 
when approached in terms of the teaching process and the school- 
master. This particular normal school is emphasizing the practical, 
however, by adding a cafeteria to be conducted by its cookery 
department. 
New Hampshire, Ohio, Kansas, South Dakota, and Washington 
report that courses in household arts have been introduced into all of 
their normal schools. 
The Aberdeen (S. Dak.) Normal School offers short courses in 
winter to girls from farms; the Bloomsburg (Pa.) Normal School 
offers a two-year honie makers’ course and some night-school work 
in household arts; and the Huntsville (Tex.) Normal School gives 
home makers’ courses in the summer. 
The Fort Hays (Kans.) Normal School gave in 1913-14 a month’s winter course for 
farmers and housekeepers which brought out 521 persons. In its new courses this year 
are included nursing and laundry. 
The Mississippi Normal College, at Hattiesburg, gives weekly practice work in 
rural school lunches in the practice school. 
The River Falls (Wis.) Normal School gives ‘‘a course in self-boarding required of all 
students who board themselves.” 
The Stevens Point (Wis.) Normal School offers a one-year and two-year home makers’ 
course for women and girls, and holds one or two home makers’ conferences each year. 
F. PROGRESS IN THE COLLEGES. 
Returns in September, 1914, from 178 colleges and universities 
that receive women students indicate that 106 of those replying offer 
courses in home economics and that of this number 37 introduced
-P-A-G-E-381
  EDUCATION FOR THE HOME. 343 
the subject in 1913 or 1914; these facts considered in connection 
with earlier returns indicate that a total of approximately 250 
colleges for women now offer distinct courses in home economics. 
Of the 106 colleges now reporting on home economics courses, 53 have 
added to equipment for these courses in the last year, and 23 colleges 
which were teaching these subjects a year ago have this year an 
increased staff in this field. 
In 1913-14 the University of Arkansas and the State College of New Hampshire 
were among the colleges which inaugurated courses in home economics. Tabor Col- 
lege, Tabor, Iowa, and the new State College for Women at Newark, Del., began 
courses in September, 1914, and the Connecticut Woman’s College, to be opened in 
September, 1915, at New London, Conn., will include courses in household arts and 
and other fields of professional study. 
The University of Mlinois in its department of household science reports growth for 
1913-14 as follows: Enrollment increased 23 per cent; the first food course, 15 per cent; 
textiles, 88 per cent; household management and lunch-room management, each 66 
per cent; advanced courses in foods, each 100 per cent; teachers’ course, 150 per cent; 
senior class in the department, 187 per cent. ‘‘The growth on the art side, where the 
total registration is 343, is gratifying, as that is not so well developed anywhere as the 
food work, and the need for trained work is very great.” 
Iowa State College has begun a two-year noncollegiate course for those interested 
in home making and for those wishing to obtain positions as institutional workers, 
dressmakers, milliners, designers, demonstrators, and tea-room managers. 
Teachers College, Columbia University, offered this year an increased number of 
graduate courses in household arts; there are now offered five graduate courses in 
nutrition, two in physiological chemistry, one in organic and household chemisiry, 
two in foods and cookery, one in textiles and clothing, two in design and decoration, 
and seven graduate courses in household and institution administration, including 
the economics of the household. 
The University of Vermont, Burlington, in its department of home economics, has 
successfully made use of opportunities for studies of household administration, cost of 
living, etc., through class visits to private homes of members of the faculty, and 
several such homes have this year been opened for practice work in planning expend- 
itures, including menus for one or two weeks. Prof. Terrill finds this even more 
practical, perhaps, than a formal practice house. 
Blackburn College, Carlinville, Il., is just starting a department of household arts 
in connection with a self-help plan whereby the studeats pay $100 and work three 
hours a day. 
In Lewis Institute, Chicago, a noncollegiate curriculum of institution management 
has been added, as have also new courses in home cooking and table service and 
home nursing. 
Des Moines College, Iowa, reports that ‘‘the girls in liberal arts are now taking 
courses in home economics in a wholesome spirit.” 
Hood College, Frederick, Md., is introducing home economics into the hig) schools 
of the county, the college director acting as supervisor of home economics in the 
public schools. 
The Curtis School of Home Economics in the Municipal University of Akron, Ohio, 
opened in the fall of 1914. A four-year course is offered, leading to the degree of 
B. 8. in home economics, and a five-year course which combines the liberal-arts 
course and the home-economics course. Curtis Cottage, the gift of William Pitt 
Curtis, of Wadsworth, Ohio, with parlors, dining room, kitchen, laundry, bedrooms, 
and laboratories, is to be used for the school.

  344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
New buildings for home economics are being planned or constructed at the Uni- 
versity of Cincinnati, where a professional school of household arts, for several years 
conducted by the Cincinnati Kindergarten Association, has now been consolidated 
with the university; at Iowa State College; Goshen College, Indiana; Hood College, 
Frederick, Md.; College for Women, Allentown, Pa.; and Ohio University, Athens, 
Ohio. Brenau College, Gainesville, Ga., opened a model house in September, 1914. 
Lincoln Memorial University, Cumberland Gap, Tenn., has inaugurated extension 
work in home making, to reach rural teachers, 
Utah State College had 783 students in short courses and 166 in regular courses— 
a growth from 339 and 144, respectively. Rhode Island State College reports that 
its home-economics extension work is greatly increased. 
The Florida State College for Women added last year a full-time extension worker, 
and the State University of Wyoming a demonstrator in home economics.

  CHAPTER XIV. 
KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS, 1913-14. 
By Aumrra M. WINCHESTER, 
Kindergarten Division, Bureau of Education. 
  —Legislation—Educational meetings of the year—Kindergarten and primary grades—Testing Ine of the kindergarten—Reorganization of kindergarten training courses, 
  LEGISLATION. 
Legislation, or proposed legislation, in behalf of the extension of 
public school kindergartens has been a prominent feature of the past 
year’s advancement. Of the six States that as yet have made no 
legal enactments providing for kindergartens, Georgia and Virginia 
have put forth strong efforts to secure the passage of a permissive bill, 
i. e., one that legalizes the establishment of public school kindergar- 
tens in communities desiring them, but does not call for additional 
State appropriations. State-wide interest was aroused in connec- 
tion with the Georgia and Virginia campaigns, and while the proposed 
measures were not passed by the respective legislatures, the subject 
of kindergarten education was fully discussed in the press and among 
the people. The Virginia Legislature passed an act lowering the public 
school age from 7 to 6 years, and thus paved the way for future 
enactments looking to the improvement of the school system from the 
foundation up. There has also been legislative activity in Tennessee 
and Arkansas in behalf of kindergartens and to lower the school age. 
A real stride forward was taken in California. Through the organ- 
ized efforts of the kindergarten teachers and of the State Congress 
of Mothers the following provision has been incorporated in the school 
laws of the State: 
The board of education of every city, city and county, or the board of school trus- 
tees of every school district in this State shall, upon the petition of the parents or 
guardians of 25 or more children between the ages of 44 and 6 years, residing within 
a mile of any elementary school building situated in such city, city and county, or 
school district, establish and maintain a kindergarten or kindergartens: Provided, 
That such kindergarten or kindergartens shall be established only between the first 
day of June and the first day of August in any year. 
This measure has stimulated the growth of kindergartens to the 
extent that 45 petitions have been presented and 32 acted upon 
favorably in 21 different cities, 19 of which had never before had 
kindergartens. In anticipation of an increased demand for kinder- 
garten teachers, a kindergarten training department in the State 
345 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  346 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
normal school at San Jose has been opened, and a private training 
school has been organized at Pasadena. 
The Congress of Mothers in Illinois, encouraged by the California 
success, has begun activities leading to a similar kindergarten law in 
the State of Illinois. Efforts will be made to have similar bills passed 
in a number of other States. 
EDUCATIONAL MEETINGS OF THE YEAR. 
The programs presented at the three meetings of the two national 
organizations of kindergarten workers during the year 1914—the 
International Kindergarten Union, with the Department of Super- 
intendence at Richmond, Va., February 23-28; the International. 
Kindergarten Union annual meeting at Springfield, Mass., April 20-25; 
and the kindergarten section of the National Education Association 
at St. Paul, Minn., July 4-11—form an accurate index to those phases 
of kindergarten education in which current interest is most intense 
or in which steady progress is being made. 
At the Richmond meeting the subject of ‘The kindergarten in rela- 
tion to social work,” was presented by Mrs. Frederic Schoff and Mrs. 
Margaret J. Stannard, who made a plea for a wider range of useful- 
ness for the young woman trained in kindergarten methods. Dr. 
Dyer delivered an instructive address on “The kindergarten in rela- 
tion to the primary school and the training of teachers.” 
The twenty-first annual meeting of the International Kindergarten 
Union, at Springfield, Mass., laid emphasis upon general culture and 
social responsibility rather than upon the technical aspects of kinder- 
garten work. At the conference of training teachers and supervisors 
Miss Luella Palmer, of New York City, presented a paper on “ Prob- 
lems of the present; hopes and ideals for the future.” The subject for 
the conference was “Standards for kindergarten training.” At the 
conference of directors and assistants the subject for discussion was 
“The development of initiative,” in which emphasis was laid upon the 
flexibility of organization, etc. 
On delegates’ day the new plan of reporting by States or by groups 
was undertaken, with satisfactory results. A most comprehensive 
State report was from Illinois, read by Mrs. Topping, of Chicago, who 
said that outside the two active areas, Peoria and Chicago and suburbs, 
there were only seven towns reporting public school kindergartens. 
She said: 
In Chicago the kindergarten training schools, in addition to the standard kinder- 
garten training, conduct classes in the following subjects: 
1. Maternal efficiency, including infant welfare work, considering the child physi- 
cally and mentally. 
2. Home making and home management which has distinct reference to a high type 
of womanhood and homemaking. 
   
-P-A-G-E-385
KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS. 847 
3. Resident homes for the students, which exemplify the home-management depart- 
ment and demonstrate, through the life in the home, high spiritual and social ideals. 
4. Hygiene, which considers such phases of the subject as the child in the school- 
room and the individual and society. 
5. Elementary grade teaching and the importance of understanding it as the next 
step in the educational process. 
6. Classes in handwork, games, and stories for trained nurses to use with convalescent 
children. 
7. Social service, designed to show the kindergartner how her training may fit her 
to serve in other lines of work connected with child welfare, and the readjustment to 
the youth and maiden period. 
Some schools of Chicago have introduced the study of eugenics; 
some have courses on the Montessori method, and have utilized the 
Montessori material in the practice schools, while others have gone 
into lines of child study based upon recent scientific elaborations 
of mental and physical tests. 
The report of cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts, presented 
by Mrs. Susan Harriman, was illuminating. Ten cities and ten towns 
in that part of Massachusetts east of and including Worcester sup- 
port 267 public kindergartens, registering 14,700 children, at an 
average yearly cost of $22.50 per capita. The entrance age varies 
from 34 to 5 years. 
The closing session was characterized by addresses by Dr. John G. 
Hibben, president of Princeton University, who spoke on the sub- 
ject of ‘‘The mechanical mind,” and Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, presi- 
dent of Amherst College, who discussed the question of ‘Liberal 
education.” 
Many new lines of thought were presented for consideration at 
the kindergarten department of the National Education Association, 
St. Paul, Minn. Dr. P. P. Claxton, United States Commissioner of 
Education, opened the session, with an address on ‘‘The readjust- 
ment of the kindergarten and primary grades to conform to the 
same general principles,’ in which he advocated much out-of-door 
work in kindergartens. He thought that if sessions were held in the 
open air much of the equipment now used might be dispensed 
with, but he upheld the Gifts as giving the child experiences which 
assist him in interpreting the things of life. He believed that the 
kindergarten and high school have much to learn from each other, 
Rousseau, he said, discovered childhood, but knew nothing of infancy. 
Froebel discovered infancy.

Margaret E. Schallenberger spoke of the difficulty experienced in 
California in establishing new kindergartens under the present tax 
laws of the State. Dr. Schallenberger dwelt on the fact that there is— 
a need of more knowledge on the part of kindergartners of the work of primary grades 
and more knowledge on the part of primary teachers of the work of the kindergarten, 
so in the coming year their training schools will have a combined course of kinder- 
garten and primary work. 
Mrs. Ware described a new feature in the training schools of Indi- 
ana, where kindergartners are required in the afternoon for one hour 
to work with children of other grades in stories, songs, games, and 
handwork. 
The attention of the conventions of the year was given, in the 
main, therefore, to discussions of the following topics: (1) The rela- 
tion between the kindergarten and the primary grades; (2) testing 
and measuring the kindergarten by its results; (3) the reorganization 
of kindergarten training courses. 
KINDERGARTEN AND PRIMARY GRADES. 
In particular the possibility of closer organic relation between the 
kindergarten and the primary grades is receiving serious attention at 
the present time. The tendency to pass over the chronological ages 
’ of children in favor of their mental ages, and to regard as one unit 
the period between 5 and 8 years, is bringing about changes in belief 
and practice. Reports from various parts of the country at the In- 
ternational. Kindergarten Union meeting indicated clearly that an 
approach to the problem has already been made by means of the 
establishment of friendly and sympathetic relations between kinder- 
garten and primary teachers, a necessary preliminary to the real 
integration of kindergarten work with primary work. The year’s 
advance lies in earnest efforts to go a step beyond sympathetic 
understanding and to work out effective means of organizing the 
two phases of education. In general, there are three types of plans: 
(a) To arrange courses of study in elementary schools in such a way 
as to take cognizance of the subject matter of the kindergarten ‘“program” 
and interrelate it with that of the rest of the school. For instance, the 
faculty of Speyer School, Teachers College, New York City, is making 
a careful scientific study of such interrelation. The children’s hand- 
work, number work, music, stories, etc., move forward in progressive 
development. The first grade does not duplicate what has been done 
in the kindergarten any more than the second grade duplicates the 
work of the first grade in the usual school program. 
(b) To place the kindergartens and primary grades of a school system 
under the supervision of one person, and that person a trained kinder- 
gartner. One notable instance of a successful arrangement of this 
kind is to be found in Los Angeles, Cal. Miss Grace Fulmer, super-

KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS. 349 
visor of kindergartens and primary grades, under whom the new plan 
is being worked out, declares: * 
The child whocomesfrom the home to the first grade does not differ much in hisatti- 
tude toward things from the one who comes from home to the kindergarten. He has 
had only a little more experience, a few more interests, a little better control of himself 
and his world; but it is the same self it was the year before, and itis the same world 
with its horizon stretched a bit. * * * The child leaves no impulse, instinct, 
interest, behind him, but brings them allalong, each more forceful than the year before, 
and therefore in greater need of wise guidance and directed exercise. * * * To 
these interests is added a new one, his by natural right as well as by tradition, and that 
is the book, and the reading of the book. 
Surely here is an opportunity for continuity in the educative process, when we 
take what the child brings from home in the way of experience, give it more meaning 
and begin to organize it in the kindergerten; broaden, deepen, enrich, and expand it 
from grade to grade in such a way that every school day will mean life, more life, and 
yet more abundant life. 
(c) To reorganize the training courses in normal schools so that the 
students shall be required to practice in primary grades as well as in the 
kindergarten. Of 123 kindergarten training schools reporting to the 
Bureau of Education, the third method is used in 59, the time 
spent in primary practice ranging from 6 to 20 weeks. This plan has 
proved fruitful and bids fair to become much more widely adopted. 
An interesting experiment in developing the connection between 
kindergarten and the grades is under way in Boston. The following 
statement is by a Boston teacher participating in the work: 
In the spring of 1913, Dr. Franklin B. Dyer, superintendent of schools, called for 
volunteers from among the kindergartners to try the experiment of doing advanced 
kindergarten work with the children of the primary grades for two afternoons a week. 
The response was immediate and cordial; in September there were 49 kindergartners 
at work at this problem in 30 school districts, with the children of 60 primary classes. 
The organization varied somewhat, but the most common arrangement was for the 
kindergartner to take one division of the lowest primary grade for the first hour of the 
afternoon session, and the other division for the second hour of the session, reversing 
the order of the divisions on the second day. Occasionally her work was with only 
the lower divisions of two first grades, and again it extended into a second grade. 
Great freedom was allowed in the choice of activities and arrangement of the pro- 
gram, though at Dr. Dyer’s request all the teachers gave ample opportunity for the 
free conversations familiar in the kindergarten, but often lacking in the primary 
classes, with their larger numbers and more formal procedure. Advanced gift and 
handwork were used in most classes, the former for free construction and for number 
work, the latter for hand training and for free expression of experiences, drawing and 
paper cutting proving especially valuable in this work. Games were played, stories 
were told, and many delightful excursions were taken to woods and parks and farms 
and beaches, both stories and excursions furnishing rich supplies of material for con- 
versations and expression through handwork. 
At the close of the year the 60 primary teachers were asked for reports and frank 
comments on the experiment, All but one reported favorably, many with enthu- 
siasm. The chance which it gave them to work with smaller groups was greatly ap- 
preciated, and several reported specifically that this had resulted in having a larger

number of children than usual ready to promote. That the experiment had awakened 
intelligent interest among the teachers is shown by their questions: Could we arrange 
for conferences between kindergarten and grade teachers? Could primary teachers 
be given time for home visiting? Is there any way of furnishing instruction in kin- 
dergarten work as a whole to primary teachers in active service? Can the ideals of 
the kindergarten be made the ideals of the school? Can the grades be given a more 
flexible program? Can there be more time for this extension work another year? It 
is hoped that some of these questions may be answered by degrees through the new 
three-year kindergarten primary course to be established in the Boston Normal 
School in the fall of 1915, which is to give special training for teaching in the kinder- 
garten and first three grades, a step which ought to do much toward bridging the 
gulf that so often exists between the kindergarten and school. 
The following extracts from letters written by kindergartners who carried on the 
experiment last year will give a more vivid idea of its significance than can be con- 
veyed by general statements. 
1. (From a kindergartner in a crowded suburban district where very few children 
come from even comfortably well-to-do homes.) 
As the spring began I took the children out whenever I could to see the awakening 
ofnature. We noticed the grass and leaf buds and early flowers as they came—snow- 
drops, tulips, and hyacinths. Previous to this the children were interested in the 
growing plants that I had in the kindergarten; I had a pan of daffodils, two pots of 
hyacinths and two pans of paper white narcissus at different times, and the children 
enjoyed noticing each week how they had developed. We had drawing lessons based 
on these observations and on the flowers I took to the kindergarten from week to week, 
such as pussy willows, anemones, mayflowers, dandelions, violets, lady’s slippers, 
columbine, etc. 
One week we went to a friend’s house and saw in her yard ducks, hens, and two 
turkeys, one a very fine gobbler. The day being windy, we noticed the clouds and 
weather vanes. One vane we studied, and the children noticed the different letters 
on it, and with a little careful looking and some explanation we found that the wind 
was southwest. On each walk we usually had a few minutes for free play in one of our 
two parks, and on this same windy day we stood under a group of pine trees and 
heard the song of the wind through them. * * * We went to the Aquarium—a 
visit thoroughly enjoyed. Out of a class of 40 children, only 7 or 8 had ever been 
there before. We also had a half hour’s fun on the beach each day, and for some of 
the children the car trip was an unusualtreat. They were well-behaved, and we had 
a good time all around. 
2. (From a kindergartner in a suburban district, close to the country, where many 
of the people own their own homes.) 
After much groping about among the many alluring possibilities, I decided that, 
first and foremost, I would take those primary children out of doors into the woods 
and fields each week, and that I would also train them to careful and accurate use of 
scissors and paint brush. This latter work was carried on for several months and. 
resulted in marked improvement in the quality of their handwork throughout the 
first-grade year. 
The children loved the excursions. We climbed out upon Sally’s Rock and rev- 
eled in the far-reaching view; we wandered in the woods listening together to the 
music of the wind in the tree tops, or watching red and gold leaves drift silently 
down against a background of dark evergreens; we were blown about the open fields 
by the “ wild west wind,’’ who swayed the tall grasses like ocean billows around us 
and sent masses of great fleecy clouds flying over our heads. Back in kindergarten 
again, we talked our excursions over together, occasionally weaving our experiences 
into a simple story, which I often wrote down bit by bit as the children gave it to me. 
Dearest of all to the children’s hearts was the trip to the Zoo, and nothing could be 
more spirited and graphic than the set of drawings in which next day they immor- 
talized every slightest detail of that experience. 
As the weather became too severe for excursions, story-telling and games were sub- 
stituted. The children were always delighted and eager to cut or draw their version 
of the story given them, and some of these versions proved most entertaining. The 
best drawings were those illustrating the stories of David and Goliath and How Cedric 
became a Knight. The class gained perceptibly, too, in power to retell the stories 
in response to a few leading questions.

KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS. 351 
TESTING THE VALUE OF THE KINDERGARTEN. 
Testing and measuring the value of the kindergarten by its results 
is a theme no less interesting to the entire school world than to the 
kindergarten portion of it. For several years investigations have 
been undertaken in different cities for the purpose of ascertaining in 
concrete terms the advantages gained by children with kindergarten 
training over nonkindergarten children. The emphasis in these 
investigations has been placed usually upon the rate of speed with 
which the children make the successive grades. The fallacy of draw- 
ing conclusions from such surveys is manifest at once. In the first 
place, it is well-nigh impossible to gauge the speed correctly, because 
in the first grade both kindergarten and nonkindergarten children are 
placed together, and by the rule of uniformity which seems necessary 
in school systems, the teacher more or less unconsciously standardizes 
the progress of her class. The laggards are brought up by dint of 
conscientious work, and the forward ones are held in leash, so that 
by the time the fifth or sixth grade is reached, whatever special 
impetus may have resulted from a child’s kindergarten training has 
ceased to be measurable. 
A correct evaluation of the kindergarten in point of time saving can 
never be reached except where kindergarten children are kept sepa- 
rated from nonkindergarten children throughout their subsequent 
school course, and are advanced as rapidly as healthy development 
allows. An experiment of this type has been under way for a year 
or more at Horace Mann School, New York City, and before another 
five years have passed definite data on this problem should be 
available. 
In the second place, the permanent value of the kindergarten has 
little if any connection with the number of years required to go 
through the grades. The kindergarten’s concern is with the content 
of the years rather than with their number; with the fullness of the 
life of the child rather than with mere economy of time. Richness 
of mental content, power to think and to do, a tendency to assume 
right attitudes toward life and life relationships, and an ability to 
work and play happily with one’s fellows—these are the results of 
training based upon the belief in education by development. 'The true 
test and measure of the kindergarten must be taken by qualitative 
standards; the quantitative measure must be merely incidental to 
the other. Dr. Frank McMurry, in his survey of the New York City 
schools, has supplied an instance of the kind of tests that should be 
applied in forming a judgment. The clearer perceptions gained 
during the past year or so concerning these matters are about to pass 
into action and eventuate in a somewhat different type of investiga- 
tion from that. of the past.

The following plans form a basis for an inquiry about to be under- 
: taken by the International Kindergarten Union committee on inves- 
tigation, and are indicative of the many-sidedness of the study: 
. (a) The committee believes that the value of the kindergarten, like 
. the value of home education, can not merely be shown in ways that 
permit of statistical tabulation; that to cultivate fully the capacity 
of each stage of growth in the child should be the purpose of education, 
and therefore speed is not a criterion of value. 
(6) The undertaking is to make a study in several different cities 
of one set of children who entered kindergarten five years ago, and 
another set in the same school who did not attend kindergarten. 
(c) The records of these children will then be examined with 
reference to their interests, attitudes, spirit toward one another, etc.; 
also with reference to their proficiency in different school studies. 
(d) In both cases the quality and spirit of the teachers who have 
had these children must enter into the estimates. 
(e) The quality and spirit of the homes also will be taken into con- 
sideration. 
REORGANIZATION OF KINDERGARTEN TRAUNING COURSES. 
Discussions of the content and organization of training courses for 
kindergarten teachers have been growing more thoughtful and force- 
ful. Demands on all sides are insistent that the kindergartner shall 
have a wide acquaintance with educational principles in general and 
their application to all periods of childhood and youth; that she shall 
be so trained as to have an intelligent as well as sympathetic under- 
standing of problems of teaching throughout elementary and second- 
ary schools, and a firm grasp of the biologic and hygienic principles 
that play so large a part in the present-day conception of education. 
Another factor in this question is the increasing demand for kinder- 
garten-trained women to engage in various forms of social welfare 
work. It is recognized that such women haye a peculiar fitness for 
serving as charity organization officers, school-home visitors, mis- 
sionaries, deaconesses, settlement residents, organizers of parents’ 
clubs, librarians of children’s rooms, ete. In consequence, the courses 
of training schools are being enriched and enlarged in order to give 
still better preparation to their students for the new and wider oppor- 
tunities of usefulness. In some instances the length of the period of 
training has been extended from the customary two years to three 
years in order to include courses in sociology, social welfare, hygiene, 
maternal efficiency, and similar subjects, as well as the more specific 
pedagogical courses. Efforts to adjust wisely the proportion of time 
that shall be devoted respectively to technical kindergarten subjects 
and materials, to the academic branches, to general pedagogy, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-391
  KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS. 353 
to practice-teaching, are causing much earnest deliberation and ex- 
perimentation. Soimportant is this problem that it has been selected 
as the main subject for discussion at the conference of kindergarten 
teachers and supervisors to be held in connection with the Interna- 
tional Kindergarten Union meeting at San Francisco, August, 1915. 
The results of the emphasis on health and hygiene in the kinder- 
garten training schools are evident in many ways, but particularly 
in the establishment of open-air classes for kindergarten children as 
well as other grades. Partial reports show the existence of effective 
outdoor kindergarten work in communities of seven States—Califor- 
nia, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, [linois, and 
Pennsylvania—and in Hawaii. 
Closely connected with the open-air doctrine is the proposal to 
place the annual vacation for kindergarten children and teachers in the 
winter months, when bad weather always decreases the attendance, 
and to hold sessions during the summer months, thus making the 
kindergarten year run from March to January. The success of 
vacation schools and summer kindergartens, wherever held, is a 
forceful argument, and in two or three instances kindergartners are 
making the experiment. When the response becomes more general, 
it will be only astep from shifting the vacation time to holding kinder- 
gartens all the year round. But that is another story. 
A thorough overhauling of the subject of the education of little 
children has been the result of the spread of Dr. Montessori’s ideas in 
this country. Parents, school men, and kindergartners are all 
beneficiaries of the renewed interest in child life in general and of 
the attention which has been focused upon the important pre-school 
years in particular. Kindergartners are especially grateful for the 
reemphasis which has been placed by Dr. Montessori upon Froebel’s 
demands for greater freedom in education, for development of indi- 
viduality, for self-activity, and for right sense training. In several 
training schools, lectures on the Italian method and materials are now 
included in the courses in general pedagogy; and in a few communities 
kindergartens make use of the Montessori materials in addition to 
the Froebelian materials, and keep records of the experiments. 
Froebelian materials are also being used according to Montessori 
methods, and the results carefully noted. 
  STATISTICAL GROWTH. 
In the matter of the numerical extension of the kindergarten a 
survey of statistics for 1913-14 made by the Bureau of Education 
reveals a most satisfactory rate of increase. It has been possible to 
secure data from practically every village and city in the country 
with a population of 500 and over. It would seem that lack of size

kindergarten; some of the most effective kindergartens are in small 
villages where community ideals are high. Comparative figures for

CHAPTER XV. 
THE MONTESSORI MOVEMENT IN AMERICA. 
By Anne E. Georer, 
Director of Work for the Montessori Educational Association, Washington, D. C. 
A review of the Montessori movement in America can, at present, 
be little more than a broad review of the interest manifested in this 
country toward the pedagogical spirit and methods developed by 
Dr. Montessori in her experimental schools and set forth in her books. 
Statistics of schools where the materials are used or the principles 
applied are not available, and an attempt to make a report of such 
_a nature would probably strengthen the tendency, greatly deplored 
by Dr. Montessori, toward the rigid classification of her contribution 
to the science of pedagogy within the narrow limits of a ‘‘method of 
teaching.” 
The tenement schools in Rome within which Dr. Montessori initiated 
her experiments with normal children were regarded by her as labora- 
tories for research work. To this study of man in the formative 
period she brought years of scientific preparation. Her first book, 
“Pedagogical Anthropology,” consisting of lectures given in the 
University of Rome, is a partial record of this preparatory period. 
Her next book, through which her work is best known, was published 
(in Italy) in May, 1909, after two years’ observation and experiments 
in the Case dei Bambini (children’s houses), as the schools in the San 
Lorenzo tenements were called. Dr. Montessori gave to this book 
the title ‘‘The Method of Scientific Pedagogy Applied to Infant 
Education.” She still holds by this title as defining the work done 
by her, and regrets the fact that it has been rejected by the publishers 
in many of the countries where the book has been translated. 
The idea of applying the methods of experimental science to the 
study of man was not new; Dr. Montessori’s particular contribution 
to the work has been that of establishing the conditions of the experi- 
ment, of developing a method of research that, while distinctly 
analogous to that of other branches of experimental science, has 
been modified by the characteristics peculiar to the form of life 
under observation. 
Briefly summed up, her method for the experimental study of 
man reads: 
Give the best conditions of life, and then, as is done with other living organisms, 
give freedom for development, disturbing as little as possible, observing, certainly 
helping, by every means, in this development. 
355 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  356 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Out of such experimental study Dr. Montessori has evolved an 
environment adapted to the special needs of young children, and a 
wide range of ‘‘didactic material,” so called because its use is so 
evident, the control it offers so strong, that it tends to replace the 
teacher at the earliest stage of education and to make it possible for 
the child to accomplish his first work independently of a mature 
mind. Out of such experiments she confidently expects others to 
bring fresh facts, and to build up the content of scientific pedagogy 
through a method of research, limited by no personality, allied 
solely to human beings who develop in liberty. 
That pedagogical work of such a character was destined to meet 
with great interest in the United States is clear to anyone familiar 
with educational progress in this country. The biological concept 
of liberty, as the right of the individual to develop freely, had for 
many years been manifesting itself in various departments of social 
reform. In the public school system this tendency found expression 
in dental clinics, in special classes for exceptional children, and 
medical inspection of schools, all intended to lessen or remove infirmi- 
ties of mind or body, which prevent the free development of the 
individual. 
The history of the Montessori movement in America begins, prop- 
erly speaking, with the publication, in McClure’s Magazine, May, 
1911, of an article by Josephine Tozier, entitled, “An Educational 
Wonder-Worker, the Methods of Maria Montessori.’”’” My own atten- 
tion had been called to the work two years earlier by an account of 
the Case dei Bambini in Rome and Milan, contained in a letter from a 
friend living abroad. This account filled me with an intense desire 
to learn more of the methods employed, and as at that time there 
was no literature on the subject in the United States, I could only 
gratify this desire by going to Italy. In Rome I met the Dottoressa 
and with her visited the San Lorenzo model tenement schools, then still 
under her direction. Profoundly impressed from this personal obser- 
vation, I determined to study the work as thoroughly as possible, and 
as the language was a serious barrier between me and the Dottoressa, 
from whom alone this new experiment could be learned, I returned to 
America to prepare myself to become her pupil. With this purpose 
in view, I brought with me a copy of the book I] Metodo della Peda- 
gogia Scientifica, applicato all’ Educazione infantile nelle Case dei 
Bambini and a complete set of the Materiale Didattico, at that time 
made almost entirely by hand in the Casa di Lavoro of Milan, an 
institution for the unemployed directed by the great socialistic 
reformer Alessandrina Ravizza. 
At the time there were many other individuals in the United States 
interested in making a study of Dr. Montessori’s book or planning to 
visit the schools in Italy, and in the pedagogical departments of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
    THE MONTESSORI MOVEMENT IN AMERICA. 857 
various colleges and universities much of the same sort of isolated 
study was taking place. 
In the summer of 1910 I resigned my position in Chicago and went 
to Rome in order to follow the course then given by Dr. Montessori to 
Italian teachers. At one of these lectures during the winter I met 
Miss Josephine Tozier, an American writer living abroad, and learned 
of the article which had been accepted by McClure’s Magazine, and 
which she hoped would call forth great interest in America. 
In the spring of 1911 Prof. Henry W. Holmes, of Harvard Uni- 
versity, wrote to the Dottoressa, commenting upon his interest in her 
book and expressing a desire to see it translated into English and thus 
rendered accessible to the pedagogical world in England and America. 
American educators began also to visit the schools in Rome, an evi- 
dence of growing interest in the United States. It was not, however, 
until after the publication of the article in McClure’s that Dr. Montes- 
sori was able to realize that the interest already shown by individuals 
was indicative of general readiness in this country for the ideas upon 
which her work was based. 
The history of the Montessori movement in the United States has 
been so widely affected by the circumstance that it was first presented 
to the public through the medium of a popular magazine that it seems 
necessary to make some comment upon this fact. A popular article 
can give only a superficial presentation of any scientific achievement 
and is almost certain to overemphasize nonessentials, or even weak- 
nesses, and thus for serious students and fellow scientists such a pres- 
entation often amounts to a condemnation of the achievement itself. 
For this reason the peculiar publicity given to the movement, with the 
consequent rapid manufacture and sale of its material, has been 
unfortunate in that it has obscured its essential principles. On the 
contrary, it must be considered that mothers and fathers everywhere,” 
the teachers of ail the children, are the educators whose experiments, 
whose pedagogical activities are going on constantly; theirs is the 
aetion which takes direct and persistent effect upon the children of 
the country; they are, therefore, the persons most in need of inspi- 
ration and of information. After more than four years of daily con- 
tact with this twofold situation, I am convinced that while scientific 
recognition and investigation of Dr. Montessori’s work have been 
retarded by the unusual form of its presentation to the world at 
large, the actual progress of that world toward a recognition of the 
need of serious study and observation of man in the period of develop- 
ment has been given tremendous impetus. 
The immediate response with which the magazine article met was 
amazing. Letters began to pour into the McClure office from every 
part of the country. It has so happened that from the beginning the 
greater number of these letters have passed through my hands,

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
and it seems to me pertinent to note that the point most stressed 
by a majority of the writers has been the opportunity offered for 
individual freedom in following the law of development. 
In October, 1911, at the suggestion of Mr. F. A. Vanderlip, who had 
become interested in the work, I opened an experimental class 
in this country at the home of Mrs. Edward Harden at Tarrytown, 
N.Y. While this experiment with a group of children ranging in 
age from 24 years to 9 years may be said to have brought favorable 
results, it has always seemed to me that a detailed account of it would 
be distinctly valuable as showing clearly the typical errors into which 
the Montessori directress will almost invariably fall, as well as the 
practical disadvantages of the system of experimentation when 
applied to already existing standards and conditions. This first 
experience has gone far toward bringing me to the conclusions 
expressed at the close of this review. 
At this time Mr. 8. S. McClure, acting for Dr. Montessori, arranged 
for the manufacture and sale of the materials in America, the company 
taking the name of the “House of Childhood.” The materials repre- 
sent a series of stimuli carefully selected and modified by Dr. Montes- 
sori during her quiet years of observation and experimentation in the 
Case dei Bambini, which formed for her a laboratory of psychological 
research. To make such materials available to persons interested 
in the method, but not initiated into the attitude of the scientist who 
undertakes an experiment, and with open mind awaits a reaction, 
was in some sense a mistake, as it made the method responsible for 
many failures, travesties, and illogical compromises; and yet from 
this wide opportunity for testing both theory and practice a decided 
forward impulse has been given in home and school toward individual 
freedom in the use of environment and material. Instances where 
-complete application of Montessori theory and practice have been 
made are comparatively few, but it is scarcely possible to find a school, 
public or private, into which a valuable spirit of investigation and 
change has not entered with the Montessori book or the Montessori 
materials. The same may be said for the use of Montessori materials 
inthehome. Certainly one should hesitate to recommend to untrained 
mothers or nurses that they introduce the Montessori materials into an 
environment usually planned without any serious attention to the needs 
of young children. Nevertheless, the enormous correspondence of the 
last four years gives evidence in hundreds of thoughtful, intelligent 
letters from mothers on scattered ranches or farms, in small towns 
and in large cities, sufficiently strong to make the matter of the 
restricted use of the materials an open question. 
In the spring of 1912 the English translation of the Pedagogia 
Scientifica, with an introduction by Prof. Henry W. Holmes, of

THE MONTESSORI MOVEMENT IN AMERICA. 3859 
Harvard University, was issued under the title of ‘The Montessori 
Method,” by the F. A. Stokes Co., New York. The book found a 
ready sale, and this English version enabled many people in the 
United States to go more deeply into the matter and to formulate 
more clearly their impressions of the method. These impressions 
appeared in every form, from newspaper paragraphs and editorials to 
carefully thought-out books, and represent one of the most fortunate 
and valuable phases of the movement. This generation has never 
before witnessed such an open, widespread discussion of questions 
bearing upon the education of young children. The point so strongly 
emphasized by Dr. Montessori that all places where man lives free, 
under the best living conditions, may become laboratories of experi- 
mental psychology, brought parents as well as educators into the 
field of discussion, another step toward that understanding between 
home and school which all progressive educators hope for. There 
has been much unfavorable comment, and a few have gone so far as 
to see in the methods a menace to educational progress. It is inter- 
esting to note that, as a rule, the disapproval is directed against the 
material which has evolved from Dr. Montessori’s experiment, against 
the activities for which the children manifest a preference. In almost 
every case the adverse critics approve the basic principles laid down 
by Dr. Montessori, in many cases declaring these to be identical with 
those upon which their own work is based. 
This universal expression of interest, so undeniably stimulating 
and helpful to educational progress in the United States, constituted 
in Italy an unexpected tidal wave which threatened to overwhelm 
Dr. Montessori and her Case dei Bambini. Visitors poured in from 
every quarter, often far outnumbering the children in a school, and 
demands for training became niore insistent every day. 
In an effort to organize this interest and to assist Dr. Montessori 
in adjusting herself to asituation she had not anticipated, the Mon- 
tessori American Committee was formed in the spring of 1912. 
Through this committee Dr. Montessori arranged her first inter- 
national course at Rome. More than 100 students from various 
countries enrolled for these lectures, and of this number nearly 70 
were Americans. 
In October, 1912, at the request of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Graham 
Bell, I took charge of a class of 20 children in their home at Wash- 
ington. The parents of the children enrolled in this school became 
convinced of the value of the method for educational purposes, and 
determined to put forth every effort to extend the same benefit to 
other children. To this end they formed, in May, 1913, a national 
association, with headquarters in Washington. Mrs. Alexander 
Graham Bell was chosen president.  
-P-A-G-E-398
  860 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
As stated in the articles of incorporation, the Montessori Educa- 
tional Association was formed— 
to promote and develop in America the educational movement based on the principles 
and theories of Dr. Montessori, and to assist in the establishment and maintenance of 
schools for children and schools of observation and practice conducted according to 
said principles. 
This constructive movement was met with cordial interest by peo- 
ple from all parts of the country, and the association membership now 
approximates 700. 
Two free demonstration schools have been established and are still 
maintained by the association. The first of these demonstration 
schools, established in the Friendship House settlement in Washing- 
ton, has proved an interesting example of how much beyond mere 
housing and feeding can be done for the children, under proper condi- 
tions, in day nurseries, orphanages, etc. The opinion of those who 
have closely followed the development of the children in the Friend- 
ship House school is that without radical change in diet, but with 
freedom to follow the law of normal development, mental, moral, and 
physical, they have made marked physical gains as they have also 
grown more gentle, joyous, and active. The directress of this school 
during its first year was Miss Elizabeth Fraser, one of the American 
students in Dr. Montessori’s first international course. The second of 
the association’s free demonstration schools was opened in September, 
1914, by the New York chapter of the association. This school, 
which is in the New Open Stair Tenement at the foot of Seventy- 
seventh Street, realizes in many ways Dr. Montessori’s original con- 
ception of the ‘Childrens’ House” as given in the “Inaugural Ad- 
dress”? which forms a chapter of her book.t “We have put the school 
within the house * * * leaving under the eyes of the parents 
the whole life of the teacher in the accomplishment of her high mis- 
sion.’ Miss Fraser, who left the Washington school to take charge of 
this larger work, lives in the tenement, her place in Washington having 
been taken by Miss Jane Kenney, another of Dr. Montessori’s students. 
In addition to the establishment of demonstration schools, the 
association has acted as a clearing house for Montessori information, 
putting persons in touch with Dr. Montessori, with schools and teach- 
ers, with helpful literature, besides answering hundreds of questions 
bearing upon the problem of teachers and parents. The work of this 
central bureau of information, as well as the publication of a bulletin, 
“Freedom for the Child,” was organized by Miss Zoe Russell Bate- 
man, another member of Dr. Montessori’s first international course. 
In November, 1913, Dr. Montessori, who had been constantly urged 
by her students and friends in America to come to this country,   
1For a full description of this type of school, see The Montessori Method, ch. 3, pp. 60-66, Maria 
Montessori. F. A. Stokes Co., 1912,

THE MONTESSORI MOVEMENT IN AMERICA. 361 
yielded to their persuasions and her own long desire, and in accord- 
ance with arrangements for the trip made with the help of Mr. 8. S. 
McClure, who was at the time in Rome, she arrived in New York on 
December 4. 
A series of lectures in a number of our larger cities was arranged 
for Dr. Montessori by Mr. McClure, the proceeds to be used by her in 
the establishment of a permanent center, which is necessary if she is 
to carry her research work further. At the request of the association 
I was enabled to leave my school and to accompany Dr. Montessori 
as translator. The reception given Dr. Montessori is described by 
Marian Fairchild in an article in the January number of “Freedom 
for the Child,” as follows: 
Dr. Montessori’s intuition that it was the psychological moment for coming to Amer- 
ica has been amply justified; in every place where the lectures were given the hall 
was filled; everywhere there was the spontaneous rising of the whole audience to greet 
her. It was a great and inspiring sight—the welcome given this friend of little chil- 
dren, and it came not because she brings us something new, for truth is never new, 
but because what she brings is old, is something we have felt in our own hearts and 
minds, and she stood before us, the interpreter to us, of our own inspirations. 
Of this welcome Dr. Montessori herself said: 
Often as I faced one of those great audiences and caught the look of searching inter- 
est in the faces before me, I felt myself in the presence of something greater than my 
work, Itseemed to meas if the spirit of the future came forward to meet me, to take 
my work into its hands and to carry my ideals forward to a beauty beyond the power 
of my own vision. 
Dr. Montessori sailed for Italy December 24, and partly as a conse- 
quence of the renewed interest excited in the United States a new 
international class at Rome was announced. In this course, which 
lasted from the 23d of February to the 30th of June, 15 different 
countries were represented. In spite of the fact of a very late an- 
nouncement, 45 American students were enrolled. 
A history of the schools directed by students of Dr. Montessori 
would probably indicate more clearly than anything else the measure 
in which we are ready for the experimental, scientific attitude toward 
education. Almost inevitably there must be a compromise from 
two sides; compromise from the side of the teacher, who being her- 
self the product of an earlier phase of educational progress, must in 
many cases pass through a species of intellectual rebirth in order to 
acquire the scientific spirit. To quote Dr. Montessori: 
We wish to awaken in the mind and heart of the educator an interest in natural phe~ 
nomena to such a degree that, loving nature, he shall understand the anxious and 
expectant attitude of one who has prepared an experiment and who awaits a revelation 
from it.  
-P-A-G-E-400
  862 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
And again, endeavoring to make clear the fact that what she gives 
is a working basis, not a neat, compact, complete machine, she says: 
To put it broadly, it is important to define the method (of research), the technique, 
and from its application to await the definite result, which must be gathered entirely 
from actual experience. 
The degree of success, then, of a teacher using Dr. Montessori’s 
method depends upon the extent to which she is prepared by tem- 
perament and experience to accept this scientific attitude. Cer- 
tainly no one who comprehends the high task to which Dr. Montessori 
calls the teacher could possibly see in her ‘‘method” an immediate 
and simple substitute for existing methods. 
In addition to the inevitable compromise of the ideal which must 
be made in greater or less degree by every teacher in this new sys- 
tem, there is the inevitable and perhaps more discouraging compro- 
mise forced upon the teacher in her endeavor to apply the ‘‘method 
of research” by parents and by the general public whose opportunity 
for a clear understanding has been, in most cases, more limited 
than that of the teacher. Very often this method, the mission of 
which is to reveal fresh facts and to build up a broader knowledge 
of the law whereby normal man develops, is interpreted as nothing 
more than a new and quicker way of obtaining the old timeworn 
results. In their view the developing life must express itself in terms 
of the tradition which custom has hallowed, or its progress is not 
approved, or perhaps it would be more fair to say, not recognized. 
My own conclusion, after nearly five years of intensive study of 
the method and of broad association with the movement, is that the 
history of the Montessori movement in America is bound up with 
the social evolution of the country toward what Dr. Montessori 
describes as— 
the reign of peace in which there will arise the possibility of developing all the forces 
of life (biological liberty) * * *, In such a conception the individual organism 
depends more and more upon the social organism, just as the cells depend upon the 
multicellular organism; and we may almost conceive of a new living entity, a super- 
organism made up of humanity, but in which every component part is allowed the 
maximum expansion of its personal activity emancipated from all the obstacles that 
have been successively overcome. This conception of biological liberty, in other 
words the triumph of the free and peaceful development of life through the long series 
of more or less bitter struggles and defenses of life, constitutes, in my opinion, the 
very essence of the new pedagogy. And the evolution of modern thought and of the 
social environment can alone prepare for its advent at perhaps no distant date.

EDUCATION FOR CHILD NURTURE AND HOME MAKING

PARENTS AS EDUCATORS. 
* Thirteen million children under school age depend exclusively on 
parents for their education, guidance, and care; while twenty million 
children in schools are under parental guidance and control for nearly 
six-sevenths of the time. 
The functions of the home in its educational capacity therefore 
exceed that of the school; yet parents in most instances are without 
specific knowledge of infant hygiene, child nurture, and home making; 
of the nature of children, or of the methods that will bring the highest 
development of body, mind, and spirit. 
With the most vital educational work of the world to do, oppor- 
tunity for study of child nurture, child nature, and home making 
is necessary, and should be made possible for every parent. Such 
facilities for study of the different phases of child nurture and home 
making must be available in every community and for all the parents 
of the community, to be of real service. Parents can not journey: 
away from home for this purpose; they must have their opportunities 
where they live. In view of the far-reaching importance of parental 
educational functions, there has as yet been no adequate provision 
for meeting intelligently the questions that daily confront fathers 
and mothers. 
An investigation of the educational opportunities now open has 
been made by the Home Education Division of the Bureau of Educa- 
tion. This investigation covers the educational work done outside 
363

  864 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
of schools and relates to children before school age and to school 
children outside of school hours. It covers the extension work for 
education in home making and child nurture offered to parents by 
universities, colleges, normal schools, high schools, grade schools, 
and kindergartens. It also covers the educational work for parents 
by Government departments, by State boards of health, and by 
various organizations, together with the cooperative efforts of 
agencies in this field of education. 
ORGANIZATIONS PROMOTING EDUCATION IN CHILD NURTURE. 
At the present time educational work in child nurture and home 
making for the parents of the United States is in its infancy. The 
National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher’ Associations, 
which covers the various phases of parental education, was incorpo- 
rated in 1897. The Home Education Division of the Bureau of 
Education was established in 1913. The State boards of health in 
some of the larger cities are giving education in health and hygiene. 
The settlements are reaching the people in congested districts. A 
few of the universities and colleges are doing extension work covering 
phases of home education. Some churches are giving attention to 
the necessity for education in child nurture. Kindergartners have 
always recognized the necessity for it by establishment of mothers 
clubs in connection with the kindergarten. The United States 
Public Health Service and various bureaus in the Department of 
Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of 
Labor publish educational bulletins dealing with this subject. School 
superintendents and principals cooperate in establishing parent- 
teacher associations. The Young Women’s Christian Associations 
have worked for better homes, while visiting nurse associations and 
various local organizations have extended help to parents. The 
National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations 
devised the plan of a mothers’ circle or parent-teacher association in 
every church and every school, reaching mothers and fathers of 
children. before school age as well as during and after school age. 
Upwards of 500,000 parents have been brought together for study by 
the work of the congress, while teachers everywhere testify to the 
‘increased efficiency of the school resulting from intelligent cooperation 
with the home. With national offices in Washington, and branches 
in nearly all States, with a definite plan of education and organization, 
with cooperation with educational specialists, Government depart- 
ments, universities, colleges, schools, boards of health, and other 
organizations, a machine valuable for transmission of education to 
the remotest districts has been formed. The cooperation of the 
Home Education Division of the Bureau of Education and the  
-P-A-G-E-403
  EDUCATION FOR CHILD NURTURE AND HOME MAKING. 365 
National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations has 
brought many thousand letters from parents and teachers asking 
advice and help. 
COOPERATION. 
The National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associa- 
tions cooperates with the International Kindergarten Union and the 
National Kindergarten Association, which have done much for 
parental education. Mothers’ clubs in connection with kindergar- 
tens, as well as the mothers’ circles in connection with grade schools, 
are becoming a recognized auxiliary of every school. In these not 
only the material, but the spiritual problems of child life are dealt 
with. 
It is recognized that the development of the inner life of the child, 
which rests principally with parents, is a department of study requir- 
ing far greater attention than it now receives; and that mistakes of 
parents through ignorance as to this inner life, as to the time and 
methods for its culture, cause results too serious to be ignored. 
CARE OF CHILDREN BEFORE SCHOOL AGE—EDUCATION OF PARENTS IN 
INFANT HYGIENE. 
The problem of saving children’s lives by education of mothers in 
infant hygiene was effectively worked out by Dr. Miele, Ghent, 
Belgium, in 1905-6, by a comprehensive system of créches, infant 
hospitals, milk depots, and schools for mothers, where girls and 
women were so trained in child care that the death rate of infants 
fell from 350 per 1,000 to 40 per 1,000. Paris carried the help to 
mothers still further, adding to the teaching idea by establishing 
restaurants for nursing mothers, that by proper food they might | 
retain the power to nurse their babies, multiplying the child’s possi- 
bilities of life. London followed in 1907 by establishing 38 schools 
for mothers, with object lessons in the care of the baby. 
COOPERATIVE PLAN FOR EDUCATION OF MOTHERS IN INFANT HYGIENE. 
In 1908 the National Congress of Mothers conducted an experiment 
in one district of Philadelphia for educating mothers in care of the 
baby by which the death rate was reduced 58 per cent. The board 
of education gave the use of school buildings, the board of health 
furnished names of all mothers of babies in the district, and the 
Congress of Mothers provided trained nurses and physicians, con- 
ducting weekly classes for examination of infants and education as 
to their care. This form of education is: available for mothers in 
every village and town; it becomes possible to invite every mother 
of a baby to a class for mothers meeting after school hours.
-P-A-G-E-404
    366 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
In development of the plan for nation-wide education of mothers, 
the National Congress of Mothers wrote to every board of health in 
the United States, urging that a child hygiene department be estab- 
lished; that a parents’ educational bureau be made a permanent 
feature of the work; and that to this bureau all mothers be invited 
for the purpose of studying all that conduces to the health of the 
baby and all that is injurious. This appeal resulted in the establish- 
ment of some child hygiene departments, but in many cases inability 
to secure sufficient appropriations have delayed this. The parents’ 
educational bureau in Portland, Oreg., was established as a result of 
this plea, and has been supported by the Oregon branch of the con- 
gress, though given rooms in the courthouse. 
Settlements, visiting nurse associations, and charitable organiza- 
tions have promoted education of poor mothers in many cities, but 
the task of arousing every mother to the fact that instinct is not a 
safe guide in securing health and life for babies has made necessary 
a campaign of education showing that parental ignorance of infant 
hygiene is responsible for more than half the deaths of babies. The 
interest of physicians in saving babies led to the organization of the 
American Association for Prevention of Infant Mortality. The work 
of Nathan Straus in providing pure milk for babies before any general 
attention had been given to this subject has saved many lives. 
Federal and State authorities have issued valuable bulletins on the 
eare of milk. 
Indiana, by special act of legislation, authorized the State board 
of health to publish an attractive cloth-bound book, containing full 
instructions as to the care of the baby. The Indiana Mothers Baby 
Book is sent to every mother in Indiana on registration of the baby’s 
birth. This book substantially bound will be of more permanent 
help than the paper bulletins usually published. 
The North Carolina State Board of Health publishes a pamphlet 
on the care of the baby, which is sent to every mother, with a letter 
from the governor, on the registration of the baby’s birth. 
New York State Board of Health issues a booklet on ‘‘Your 
Baby; How to Keep It Well,’ which is sent to each mother on 
receipt of the birth certificate. It is also distributed at infant wel- 
fare stations and at city and county fairs. The first edition was 
100,000 copies. 
Idaho, Virginia, and Utah also send a booklet on receipt of birth 
certificates. 
Thirteen State boards of health report that special bulletins on 
the care of the baby are distributed to parents upon request. 
The Indiana Health Board publishes in 40 newspapers every bulle- 
tin it issues, and in that way makes known to parents that this 
literature is at their disposal.
-P-A-G-E-405
    
EDUCATION FOR CHILD NURTURE AND HOME MAKING. 867 
The Pennsylvania State Board of Health publishes its baby bulle- 
tins in. five languages and does considerable exhibit work in commu- 
nities throughout the State. 
Reports of the circulation of 532,000 bulletins on “‘Care of Baby” 
in 1914 have come to the Home Education Division. This is, of 
course, but a small percentage of what has been distributed by the 
many agencies now interested in promoting education in infant 
hygiene. 
Interest of many fathers in rural districts has been aroused through 
the better babies examinations conducted at State fairs. Already 
interested in perfecting their live stock, the fact that in many cases 
their children fell below the standard of perfect development led 
them to study more carefully the conditions that are favorable to 
infant development. 
HOSPITALS EDUCATE MOTHERS. 
Hospitals in many cities are inviting mothers to weekly clinics 
where their babies are carefully examined and advice is given as 
to food, clothing, sleep, ventilation of rooms. No statistics as to 
the number of hospitals conducting clinics for mothers are available. 
A campaign of education of citizens and taxpayers can alone 
educate public opinion to the necessity of making ample appropria- 
tions to boards of health in order that they may do their part in 
reducing the death rate of little children. In the last analysis chil- 
drens’ lives depend on mothers and only by education of all mothers 
can infants have a chance for life and health. 
HELPS FOR PARENTS IN MORAL TRAINING OF CHILDREN UNDER 
SCHOOL AGE. 
The International Kindergarten Union has given practical edu- 
cational help to parents in giving them an understanding of the 
soul life of little children. Through valuable books covering this 
subject, by organization of mothers of little children for study, an 
educational work of inestimable value has been conducted. Churches 
and Sunday schools are realizing that a large part of the responsi- 
bility for moral education rests with parents and parents’ associa- 
tions are being organized in many churches to make a study of 
parents’ duties and to determine how parents may most effectively 
guide the child into moral habits. 
MOTHERS’ CLUBS IN KINDERGARTENS AND PRIMARY CLASSES. 
The mothers’ clubs in connection with kindergartens have given 
valuable educational help to parents in the guidance of little children. 
This instruction has given a different point of view and a fuller  
-P-A-G-E-406
  368 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
conception of parental duty to thousands of parents. The mothers’ 
club as a parental educational auxiliary of the kindergarten may 
be regarded as the inauguration of the movement for the educa- 
tion of mothers in child nurture. 
As the child advanced beyond the kindergarten the mothers 
found no continuation of opportunities for child study except from 
personal experience and observation, until mothers’ circles and 
parent-teacher associations began to be organized in connection 
with schools of all grades, with the purpose of extending parental 
opportunities for child study and home making all through the life 
of the child. 
WHAT SOME HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE DONE IN PROMOTION OF BETTER 
HOMES. 
In response to a letter of inquiry as to what high schools were 
doing for parents and citizens, 2,167 replied that they were doing 
nothing; 511 had established parent-teacher associations for study 
of the problems of children of high-school age by parents and teachers; 
567 high schools expressed the desire for information as to methods 
of reaching parents and help that might be given. Lantern-slide 
lectures and popular courses in cooking, sewing, hygiene, and sani- 
tation were reported in a small proportion of schools. The opening 
of school libraries for the use of citizens is noted as one form of 
home education work in some schools. Testimony as to the benefit 
to many homes resulting from the school courses in cooking and 
household arts is given by many superintendents and principals. 
HOW ONE SCHOOL ENLISTS OUTSIDE HELP IN TEACHING. 
Fayette, Ohio, has a required course for all the senior girls, which 
will be of great value to their homes now and the homes which they 
will have in a few years. They visit all the business houses,-where 
one of the firm explains facts they should know. They visit homes, 
read to the sick, prepare meals, tend babies, etc. They are learning 
baking from the best woman baker in the community. They are 
learning to clean a house from a woman who, although she has a large 
family, is noted for the neat appearance of her home. The girls 
have plain sewing and make their own commencement dresses at a 
minimum cost. 
Succasunna, N. J., conducts home extension work by a township 
library managed by the pupils of the high school under supervision 
of the faculty. From the central branch located in the high school 
deposits of books are sustained in the other schools of the township, 
which are an exchange with the central branch. As the work is

EDUCATION FOR CHILD NURTURE AND HOME MAKING. 369 
done by the pupils all the money that is expended goes for the pur- 
chase of new books. The library is thus placed within the reach 
of every home in this rural township. 
Goshen, Ind., has ‘“‘Home Reading Circle Books.” These are 
taken by the children and are governed by rules similar to those 
governing public libraries. About 75 homes are reached. 
Coalinza, Cal., has a boys’ club entitled ‘Knights of Valor,” with 
a membership of 500 men and boys; a girls’ club of over 100, and a 
parent order of 200 mothers, meeting monthly to discuss child 
welfare and school problems. The work has been very helpful in 
the home and has brought parents into a new and better conception 
of school work and deeper sympathy toward the teacher. 
The principal of Kindred, N. Dak., public schools called a meeting 
of the fathers of the school children to discuss with them matters 
that had a bearing on the welfare of their children. The greatest 
obstacles to the progress of the pupils were discussed. The chief 
of these were that children were permitted to be about at almost 
any hour of the night; that the parents set a bad example in failure 
to obey laws—particularly game laws and prohibition laws—and 
that children were frequently permitted to spend most of the night 
at dances. An immediate result was a mutual agreement among 
the fathers that each one would see that his own children were off 
the streets at dusk every evening. Another result was the adoption 
of a resolution by the school board prohibiting teachers and pupils 
from attending dances on evenings preceding school days. 
Logan County high school, Colo., gives canning demonstrations, 
talks on home sanitation and home decoration, and sends the teacher 
in domestic science to rural schoolhouse meetings to take up and 
discuss the problems of the home; conducts a winter short course in 
which an expert seamstress is employed in a laboratory fitted up for 
sewing work. Any woman who desires to bring her work will receive 
such help as she needs. Women in this department are doing all 
kinds and varieties of sewing, from altering and making-over old 
garments to making and finishing tailored suits. A community 
welfare conference is planned with instructors furnished by the 
extension department of the University of Colorado. This course 
continues for six weeks. One hundred homes were reached last year. 
The Poplarville ( Miss.) agricultural high school is making extension 
work the leading feature of the school. It is spreading the gospel 
of self-sustenance in urging that each farmer raise enough on his 
own farm to live on, without having to buy anything to eat. The 
teacher of domestic science is going into the homes, giving lessons in 
sanitation, home decoration, and cooking wherever she is invited

to do so. Invitations are so numerous now that it keeps some one 
in the field nearly all the time. 
Newberg (Oreg.) high school conducts a class in domestic science for 
the mothers, who meet once a week, and enrolls about 30 women 
outside the school. 
In New Haven, Conn., a modern workman’s house built by a 
civic federation was used during the year for the teaching of cooking 
and sewing. This was turned over to the board of education and 
assigned to the trade instruction department. Definite periods of 
instruction in cooking, sewing, and household work are open for 
residents of the district. 
Madison, Minn., has a short course in home economics open to 
mothers. Sanitation, cooking, and home decoration are taken up. 
Ashley, Ind., devoted time to study of home conditions and home 
problems, enlisting the girls and their parents in this study. 
Fort Scott, Kans., tries to raise the musical-tone of the community 
and conducts a lyceum course. 
Saginaw, Mich., opens its school Sunday afternoons for talks to 
parents by the medical supervisor. 
Ericson, Nebr., reports 60 families affected by home extension 
work. 
Ontario, Cal., has evening classes in home making and other 
subjects, reaching many young people and elderly people. 
Athens, Ga., High and Industrial School conducts a six weeks’ 
course each winter for mothers or housekeepers and domestic help. 
The course consists of two lessons per week, two hours each. A 
lecture of 45 minutes’ length and a practical demonstration in cooking 
7 are given at each lesson. Certificates are given for completion of a 
three years’ course in this department. Last year 45 housekeepers 
and domestic workers received these certificates. Some of the 
lectures are on the following subjects: ‘‘Prevention and care of 
diseases ;”’ ‘‘Sanitation—household and community;” ‘‘Foods and 
food values; ‘‘The fly; ‘‘How to beautify the home;” ‘‘Home 
gardening;”’ ‘‘Crime—its causes—its remedy.” 
. Moose Lake, Minn., high school gives a series of lectures and 
demonstrations on household economics, attended by 50 women. 
Greenwood, Va., high school invites the housewives to visit the 
domestic science department and has a series of weekly lectures on 
the sciences touching the home. 
Red Lion, Pa., high school opens its library two evenings a week, 
under the supervision of one of the instructors. Here pupils and 
their parents may come to read or discuss problems arising from the 
child’s school life. The ultimate aim is to make people realize the 
value of a public library.

Hood River, Oreg., has meetings of the parent-teacher association 
every two weeks. These are very deeply affecting the community; 
- they are the best attended meetings of any kind held in this com- 
munity. They affect about 100 families. 
Warner, Okla., has opened school for adults at night. The domestic 
science teacher visits homes. A paper is sent out every two weeks, 
with helpful hints to the housewife, and 300 homes are reached. 
Rockland, Wash., maintains a magazine exchange system of standard 
magazines, reaching many homes. Lists of the best books are sent 
out stating they may be borrowed from the high school library. This 
has doubled the use of the library. 
Towanda, Kans., opened its classes in domestic science to all 
women, and found them very popular courses. 
Rosenberg, Tex., has a parent-teacher association which has done 
much for both home and school. Approximately 60 homes were 
affected directly last year, and the whole community indirectly. 
Kioma, Okla., has a strong mothers’ club in connection with 
the school. Magazines and newspapers are collected for homes that 
have no reading matter. They are read, returned, and loaned again. 
In Mart, Tex., a parent-teacher club has been organized which 
affects about 50 or 60 homes. A debating society affects 25 or 30 
homes. Meetings of both of these are held in the school building. 
In Knoxville, Tenn., the Park City High School has a large 
mothers’ associations that is doing a great work. 
HOME EDUCATION EXTENSION WORK OF NORMAL SCHOOLS AND 
COLLEGES. 
Reports received from 125 normal schools show that 16 of these 
are doing extension work in home making, while 109 are doing 
nothing outside the school. 
The Rochester Normal Training School has a trained nurse, and 
last year reached 185 homes by inviting the mothers to meet in the 
school for instruction in washing and caring for the baby. 
The Teachers College of Indianapolis reaches the mothers by 
inviting all the mothers of children in free kindergartens to meet in 
the different kindergarten buildings, where regular outlined talks are 
given upon the responsibilities and preparation for parenthood, 
suggestions and observations of child psychology made, including 
instincts, intuitions, and interests of children, and home economies. 
Other normal schools have extension lecture courses which reach 
many parents. 
The National Kindergarten College, Chicago, Iil., has a course of 12 
lectures in a mothers’ course each year. It also has 12 lectures on 
mental development of children, and 18 lectures on physical devel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-410
    372 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
opment of children. The 18 lectures on maternal efficiency given 
to students and to mothers deal in alternate years with hygiene, 
sanitation, contagious diseases, the development of the child after 
birth, and eugenics. Extension courses are given in 56 welfare 
stations conducted by the Chicago Woman’s Club. The college 
also cooperates with numerous graduates who hold mothers’ meet- 
ings in their kindergartens. Two hundred lectures on the mental 
and spiritual training of the child are to be given at these stations 
this year by the faculty and alumni of the college. 
COLLEGES GIVING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDY OF CHILD NURTURE 
AND HOME MAKING BY PARENTS. 
The following are typical instances of the work done by colleges 
and universities in this field:

lectures on home making and child nurture.       
WORK OF WOMEN’S CLUBS IN BETTER HOME MAKING. 
Many women’s clubs in the United States have given earnest effort 
to education in household arts and domestic science. Many domestic 
science clubs have been formed for study of cooking, food values, and 
sanitation. These clubs include in their membership young girls 
and married women, and indicate an increasing desire for systematic 
scientific methods in the physical side of home making. 
The Chicago Woman’s Club conducts 50 welfare stations in which 
200 lectures on the mental and spiritual training of the child are to 
be given by the faculty and alumne of the national kindergarten 
college. In addition to these 200 medical lectures, 200 lectures on 
domestic science will be given. 
The women’s clubs have in many places secured the introduction 
of domestic science courses in schools. 
Classes for instruction in household arts are conducted in the vari- 
ous branches of the Young Women’s Christian Association. Moth- 
ers’ meetings for instruction of mothers are also a part of the work 
of the Young Women’s Christian Association.

  874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF SETTLEMENTS. 
It is estimated that in the United States some 6,000 settlements 
have been established in poor neighborhoods and congested districts 
to improve conditions through example and education. Teaching 
home making under tenement conditions is an important feature of 
these settlements. In 1897 there were 74 settlements listed; in 1905 
204; in 1911, 5,158. 
These settlements are conducted by universities, colleges, women’s 
clubs, associations of collegiate alumna, King’s Daughters, visiting 
nurse associations, and similar organizations; by gifts of individuals, 
with trustees in charge; or by religious bodies, which include the 
Baptist, Catholic, Congregational, Episcopal, Ethical Culture, Friends, 
Hebrews, Methodist, Presbyterian, Swedenborgian, and Unitarian 
denominations, and by nonsectarian yet religious bodies. 
The educational agencies established in these districts are many. 
Among them are kindergartens, classes in care of babies, sewing, 
cooking, household arts, nursing, elementary vocational and cultural 
subjects. The benefits of instruction are extended to men, women, 
and children.

ConTENTS.—History of the movement—Management—Academiec schools—Schools of design—Industrial 
art schools—Schools of architecture—Normal art schools—Art courses in colleges and universities— 
Conclusion—List of art schools classified as to management—Classified by subjects—Art school 
statistics. 
Professional art schools may be divided into the following classes: 
(1) Academic, where drawing, painting, and sculpture alone are 
taught; (2) schools of design, where, in addition to the academic 
branches, applied design is the principal subject, with craft classes 
frequently included; (3) industrial art schools, with workshops; 
(4) schools of architecture; (5) normal art schools; (6) colleges and uni- 
versities giving instruction in drawing and history of art. In a brief 
review, such as is contemplated in this chapter, it is impossible to 
describe every one of the 216 art schools that exist in the United 
States. The general characteristics of each type are, however, indi- 
cated; and under industrial art the schools offering special courses 
are listed. At the end of the chapter the schools are entered under 
the five headings, with indications regarding evening and summer 
schools. 
HISTORY OF THE MOVEMENT. 
During the eighteenth century any citizen of the American colo- 
nies who wanted to learn how to paint was obliged to go to Europe, 
and the success of Benjamin West, born in Pennsylvania in 1788, led 
many young Americans to follow him to London. Munich and Dus- 
seldorf attracted many students in the middle of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, while Paris has been the Mecca of a host of artists for the past 
50 or 60 years. 
During the period when many ambitious painters and sculptors 
were finding their way to European art schools, art was beginning to 
take root in the United States. As far back as 1791 Charles Willson 
Peale tried to found an art school in Philadelphia. He was not suc- 
cessful, but his attempt led in 1805 to the establishment of the Penn- 
sylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the oldest art institution in the 
country. The school of the National Academy of Design, New York, 
375  
-P-A-G-E-414
a a a 
376 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
dates from 1826 (following several years of desultory work), and 1844 
saw the establishment of the Philadelphia School of Design for 
Women. In 1857 Cooper Union was opened, with a free day school 
of art for women and evening classes in drawing for men; the Yale 
School of Fine Arts was organized in 1864; the School of the Art In- 
stitute of Chicago is a direct continuation of the old Academy of De- 
sign founded in that city in 1867; the Massachusetts Normal Art 
School was established in 1873; the Art Students’ League of New 
York was organized in 1875. 
The Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876 led to increased 
interest in art and in art education. The direct outcome was the 
incorporation of the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial 
Art in 1876, followed the same year by the School of the Boston 
Museum of Fine Arts, and in 1879 by the St. Louis School of Fine 
Arts. The movement spread rapidly, and art schools were organized 
in the smaller eastern cities and the larger cities throughout the Mid- 
dle West. The Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893 and the 
Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 gave impetus to 
the movement. The Panama-Pacific Exposition at San Francisco in 
1915 is expected to bring about a similar awakening on the Pacific 
coast; Los Angeles at one extreme and Portland, Oreg., at the other, 
already have well-established art schools. October, 1914, witnessed 
the opening of the Stickney Memorial Art School at Pasadena, Cal. 
MANAGEMENT. 
The schools are managed in various ways, either as parts of larger 
organizations or as independent units. The list at the end of this 
chapter shows their affiliation: (1) Affiliated with art museums; 
(2) affiliated with art socicties; (3) endowed independent art schools, 
sometimes partly supported by public funds; (4) cooperative; (5) in- 
dependent art schools maintained by city or State funds only; (6) de- 
partment of institutions of higher education—university, college, or 
departmental institution; (7) private enterprises.1 
In the art museums the director of the museum is usually principal 
of the school, with a head of each department responsible for the 
development of a particular phase of work, and a corps of teachers 
dividing their time between the different departments. The same 
division of work exists in all the large schools. At the other extreme 
are the private schools with only one instructor, and perhaps a visit- 
ing teacher. 
The management of the Art Students’ League of New York is 
unique. Tits affairs are administered by a board of control, the ma- 
jority of whom are students actually at work in the classes. It is en- 
tirely self-supporting, having no endowment fund, and has for over

-P-A-G-E-415
PROFESSIONAL ART SCHOOLS. 877 
a quarter of a century been run entirely by the tuition fees. The 
instructors have always been artists of standing. An annual com- 
petition for scholarships, open to all art students in the United States 
and Canada, exclusive of New York City, is held in March of each 
year. Ten scholarships are awarded, which entitle the recipients to 
free tuition in any two classes of the league during the following sea- 
son. The winners in 1914 included three from Buffalo, N. Y.; two 
from San Francisco, Cal.; one each from Syracuse, N. Y.; St. Paul, 
Minn.; Washington, D. C.; Boston, Mass.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Denver, 
Colo. 
Many of the art societies maintain classes. Some have fully or- 
ganized schools; others conduct sketch classes two or three times a 
week for the benefit of members; and others have evening classes. 
The chief work of most of the architectural clubs is the maintenance 
of evening ‘“ateliers,”’” where under the direction of a “patron” the 
students work out the problems arranged by the Society of Beaux- 
Arts Architects. In universities and colleges maintaining separate 
art departments, instruction is usually under the direction of the head 
professor of the department, with a corps of instructors under him; 
in addition the students have the privilege of other courses in the 
university. 
1, ACADEMIC SCHOOLS." 
The courses of instruction in the academic schools are divided 
into departments of drawing and painting, of sculpture, and of 
illustration. In each of these departments there is certain pre- 
scribed work that must be done, but the departments are closely 
allied, the advanced students in each being advised to work in the 
others. The general method of instruction is by criticism of the 
work done, but the individuality of the student is not repressed by 
fixed methods. The aim is to help the student to observe accurately 
and record truthfully what he sees and as he sees it. ; 
In order that students who have had little or no training in drawing 
may pursue their studies under the easiest conditions and advance 
naturally to higher work, a preparatory antique course is conducted, 
which includes drawing from casts of classical sculpture, drawing 
and painting from still life, and lectures upon composition, per- 
spective, and anatomy. For admission to the antique course, 
drawings or sketches from the solid object in any medium are re- 
quired, and applicants may prepare these in the schoolrooms or 
forward examples made for the purpose. 
Classes in drawing and painting—Work includes drawing and 
painting from the human figure, drawing and painting from the 
head, and from still life; also lectures upon composition, perspec- 
1 This description is based on the announcement of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Aris. 
   
-P-A-G-E-416
878 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
tive, and anatomy. Students are admitted to the life and head 
classes after an examination of their work in drawing from the full 
length figure, either antique or life. The class in composition is to 
encourage the student to express his impressions and conceptions. 
The class meets from week to week to exhibit its work for compari- 
son and open discussion. Mural decoration is given special attention; 
a subject with definite requirements is offered, and whenever possible 
students are given an opportunity to decorate a wall space. 
Lectures on anatomy are open to students of any course without 
extra charge. They are frequently illustrated with the stereopticon, 
with drawings made in the presence of the class by the instructor, 
and also by means of the living model. Lectures on perspective 
are open to students of any course without extra charge. The 
course consists in lectures upon the elements of linear perspective, 
illustrated by drawings made before the class; exercises upon the 
same subject and sketching from the solid object and from nature, 
and in the application of the knowledge thus gained to illustration 
and painting. The way in which artists of various schools have 
used the principles of perspective is demonstrated by lantern pro- 
jections of their works. 
Classes in illustration.—These provide such practical instruction 
for the students as will enable them, upon the completion of the 
course, to enter immediately the professional field of magazine and 
book illustrating, decoration, and newspaper work. Instruction is 
given in drawing, in composition, and in the technique of all 
mediums— pen, charcoal, black and white, tempera, and oil. There 
is special work from still life—drapery, furniture and interiors, 
flowers and foliage; mechanical and free-hand perspective; historic 
costume; decorative lettering; anatomy; original composition for 
bookplates, head and tailpieces, initial letters, titles, posters and 
general decorative illustration. In addition to the regular class 
work, lectures are given during the year by practical specialists 
upon the various processes of reproduction for the purpose of print- 
ing, and students are instructed to work with the particular process 
in view that is to be employed in reproducing their illustration. 
Practically all the academic schools have courses in illustration. 
Etching is taught in a few schools, notably at the National Academy 
of Design and at the Art Students’ League, both in New York. 
Classes in sculpture—The work consists of modeling from the 
living model, generally in the round, but occasionally in relief, and 
from both the full-length figure and the head only. In addition to 
the work from life, each student is required to present sketch models 
of sculptural themes, on which he receives individual criticism. 
Special facilities for the study of sculpture are offered in the following 
schools:
-P-A-G-E-417
    
PROFESSIONAL ART SCHOOLS. 879 
Baltimore, Ma.—Rinehart School of Sculpture; endowed. 
Cleveland, Ohio.—Cleveland School of Art; separate well-equipped studio. 
Edgartown, Mass.—Summer school. 
New York, N. Y.—Sculpture studio; maintained by the Society of Beaux Arts Archi- 
tects and the National Sculpture Society (special emphasis is placed on decora= 
tive sculpture as related to architecture). 
Ogunquit, Me—Summer School of Modeling. 
Philadelphia, Pa.—Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (special prizes and 
scholarships are offered). 
Tuition fees in the academic schools average $100 for the season’ 
of eight months. Numerous free scholarships and prizes are open 
for competition. The most important are those offered by the 
American Academy in Rome each year to one painter, one sculptor, 
and one architect. This scholarship entitles the winner to $1,000 a 
year for three years and residence at the school in Rome. The 
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts makes numerous awards 
from the income of the Cresson scholarship fund; 16 pupils were 
given $500 each in 1913 for European travel. Prizes for meritorious | 
work range from $300 down to $10, and are given more or less liberally 
in every school. 
Saturday morning classes for children are maintained by many 
of the schools. 
The summer schools offer special facilities for landscape painting, 
and their normal departments are particularly active during the 
period of school vacation. 
2, SCHOOLS OF DESIGN. 
The drawn line rules the world, for with it are written in the language of form the 
laws of the fine and industrial arts. This universal language of form is the tongue 
of the genius of modern productiveness—not a phonetic, but a pictorial tongue—and 
hundreds of millions depend upon its utterances for their daily bread. To set up 
a modern locomotive requires 68 separate scale drawings, showing every bolt in place; 
these are multiplied three or four times for the shop. It is the same with the guns, 
great and small, with which we destroy our fellows scientifically and with all the 
complex enginery of war—fortifications, ordnance material, magazines, barracks, 
maps, and material of transportation—each of which is born on paper. 
Thus wrote the late Col. Charles William Larned, professor of 
drawing at the West Point Military Academy. 
On the other hand, Arthur W. Dow, director of the department 
of fine arts of Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, 
emphasizes the value of the ‘‘design method,” in opposition to the 
traditional ‘‘drawing method” of teaching art. In an address 
before the Western Drawing and Manual Training Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation, May, 1912, he said: 
The drawing method is analytic, dealing with the small, the details, the applica- 
tion of art; the design method is synthetic, dealing with wholes, unities, principles 
ofart. The theory of the design method can be put into a single phrase: First, study 
   
-P-A-G-E-418
  380 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the art, then apply it. * * * The problem is how to teach art so that all 
may share it; how to relate it to new demands and new thought in education. I 
believe that what I call the design method is equal to every condition, because it is 
built on an inherent human desire for choosing the fine—the desire to make something 
look well, whether the work be a machine or a painting. This aim brings order out 
of anarchy; it gives a definite reason for drawing from nature, for studying arrange- 
ment, proportion, tone, and color. 
Courses in design include the general principles of composition, 
line harmony, spacing, proportion, rhythm, dark-and-light values; 
color in theory and practice; exercises with brush and ink, charcoal, 
colored crayons, and water color. The courses include the study, 
analysis, and rendering of historic ornament—Byzantine, Roman- 
esque, Saracenic, Gothic, Renaissance, and modern styles; plants, 
flowers, birds, and animals from nature for decorative application. 
Original designs are made for stencils, for oilcloth and linoleum, 
lace and curtains, carpets and rugs, embroidery, chintzes, silks, 
cretonnes, and prints, stained glass and mosaic, and leather work. 
Many of the schools of design offer ample facilities for carrying 
out work from the design in what are generally known as the crafts. 
These crafts—or, more properly, handicrafts—are distinguished from 
the industries by requiring less mechanical equipment and more 
handwork. They include courses in jewelry, metal work, book- 
binding, etc. The following special courses given in schools of design 
depend entirely upon design adequately rendered: 
Costume design and costume illustration.—A study of design as applied to costume 
with technical training in pencil, pen and ink, charcoal, and blackboard drawing; 
sketching of gowns and hats. Courses are adapted for professional designers of cos- 
tume, for teachers of costume design, and for teachers of household arts. Costume 
illustration aims only to render the design with such technical excellence that it 
will be available for reproduction. 
Illustration for commercial purposes.—Lettering, poster work, planning of window 
cards, letter heads, and sign painting. A special class for color printing was estab- 
lished at Teachers College of Columbia University, New York, in 1914, 
Interior decoration —The subjects studied are: Historic ornament in its applica- 
tion to original schemes for interior decoration; harmony and contrast of color; model- 
ing of ornament; water-color rendering; original designs and working drawings for 
furniture, woodwork, hangings, mosaic, stained glass; the making of stencils; drawing 
from the cast and life; library research under direction; the application of studies 
from nature to practical use and the constant consideration of the principles of decora- 
tive fitness. 
3. INDUSTRIAL ART SCHOOLS. 
The close relation between art and industry, and the dependence 
of industry upon art, were scarcely appreciated by the majority of 
educators in this country in the first half of the nineteenth century. 
As for the manufacturers, they were content, apparently, with using 
foreign workmen as designers or stealing patterns from imported 
samples, and perhaps working the designs over somewhat. The
-P-A-G-E-419
  
PROFESSIONAL ART SCHOOLS, 381 
Centennial Exposition brought directly to the attention of both 
producer and consumer the fact that the United States was far 
behind other nations in the quality of its manufactures. The public 
had an opportunity to see the best work from France, Germany, 
Great Britain, Russia, and other countries, and there was a genuine 
awakening to our shortcomings. 
Isaac Edwards Clarke, in his report on ‘Art and Industrial Edu- 
cation” for the United States Commission to the Paris Exposition 
in 1900, said: 
The industries and arts of a people are determined by their needs, their desires, 
and their intelligence. So long as individuals and communities have never seen 
the added attractions given to buildings, furniture, clothing, and household imple- 
ments by the application of art to such articles of prime necessity, so long there is 
no demand for the production of similar artistic articles; but let once their eyes be 
opened by asight of the wonders of a world’s fair or an art loan collection and imme- 
diately the demand is created. 
Great Britain was aroused by the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 
1851 at Hyde Park, London, the first of the great “world fairs,” to 
a realization that her artisans lacked skill, taste, and artistic train- 
ing. This led to the immediate reorganization of the Government 
School of Design under the name of the South Kensington School 
of Art and Design. At present the vast Victoria and Albert Memo- 
rial Museum at South Kensington, London, with its school housed 
in an adjoining building, is the heart of an extensive system of indus- 
trial art education which includes schools and local museums in 
every city of any importance in the United Kingdom. 
Just as in industrial education a distinction is made between a 
trade school and a technical industrial school, so also among art 
schools there is a distinct difference between the school of design 
which does not offer opportunities for direct application of the 
design to manufacture and the fully equipped industrial art school 
with its building devoted to one or more phases of art applied to 
industry. In the latter the pupils can carry the work through the 
various steps from the first sketch, the carefully executed design, 
the numerous working drawings, the making of the object, and on 
to the salesroom. Between these two extremes are the schools where 
facilities are offered for carrying out from the design what are gen- 
erally known as the crafts. A few public high schools are now offer- 
ing vocational training along industrial art lines; a notable example 
is the Washington Irving High School, in New York City, where the 
girls may specialize in costume illustration or commercial design. 
The New York Evening Industrial Art School has recently been 
organized as part of the public school system. Some of the best 
instruction is secured through schools maintained by the manufac- 
turers in their factories, but little information is available regarding 
these apprentice schools.

382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Fees and hours.—The day industrial art schools are usually in 
session from 9 to 4; tuition for a full course varies from $75 to $150 
for a year of eight months—October to June. To students from 
foreign countries the rate is about double.. Evening classes are 
maintained from 7.30 to 9.80, and the tuition averages $15 for six 
months—October to April. Saturday classes, 9 to 12 a. m., are given 
in nearly all branches of art pursued in the regular day classes, with 
the addition of lectures on methods of teaching and on art history; 
tuition about $10 for six months. 
Applicants for admission to the industrial art schools must have 
a knowledge of common English branches and of drawing equal to 
the completion of the ordinary grammar-school grades. 
Scholarships offered at the Pennsylvania School of Industrial Art 
include at least one scholarship from each county of the State, 
entitling the holder to free tuition in any regular course of the school 
for three years. The board of education of the city of Philadelphia 
also provides free instruction in the school. Pupils of the high 
schools, as well as of the Normal School and of the Publie Industrial 
Art School, are eligible for these appointments, application for 
which must be made to the principals of the several schools. A 
certain number of free scholarships are provided through special 
gift and bequests to the school; in all, some 200 free scholarships 
are available. At the Rhode Island School of Design the State 
provides a number of scholarships in the day school and the city 
furnishes scholarships for the evening and Saturday classes. The 
New England Manufacturing Jewelers and Silversmiths’ Association, 
the State Federation of Women’s Clubs, and various other organiza- 
tions and individuals also give scholarships in this school. Similar 
privileges can be secured at other schools for a limited number of 
worthy students. 
Courses in these industrial art schools are based upon thorough 
training in design adapted to special materials. Courses of study 
in the various branches, and the schools offering these courses, are 
as follows:1 
Bookbinding and leather work—The course includes sewing, forwarding, finishing, 
and library binding; cased books with stiff boards and with flexible boards; laced- 
in boards; half leather and full leather; blind tooling; portfolios; wall and furniture 
panels from original designs. The study of good examples of bookbinding is empha- 
sized. Classes in bookbinding are maintained in the following schools:

Modeling for architecture-—The students model in different degrees of relief and 
in the round ornament of various styles, studies of the human figures and of animal 
from nature, casts, and prints. Original designs are made in clay, wax, and plasters 
for terra cotta and architectural ornament, for concrete, for cast and wrought 
metal, for wood and stone carving, for furniture and mosaic. The execution from the 
design of furniture, pottery, and mosaic are essential parts of the course; and some 
decorative application to an important subject, such as a foundation or wall panel, 
is made the final problem. Modeling is taught in nearly all the academic schools 
and in many of the other schools. The following schools give special attention to 
architectural requirements: 
New York, N. Y.—Evening School of Industrial Arts; Sculpture Studio of the 
Society of Beaux-Arts Architects and National Sculpture Society. 
Philadelphia, Pa.—Pennsylvania School of Industrial Art. 
Providence, R. I.—Rhode Island School of Design. 
Trenton, N. J—School of Industrial Art. 
Textile—The curriculum includes the following departments: Design planned 
with special reference to the construction of fabrics and their decoration; color har- 
mony and figured design; cotton, wool, worsted, and silk warp preparation and 
weaving; knitting; chemistry, dyeing, and printing; power weaving; textile engi- 
neering; finishing. The Lowell and New Bedford textile schools have developed 
from trade schools in contrast to the Pennsylvania School of Industrial Art which has 
developed from an academic art school. These three are the only textile schools. 
Woodwork, carving, furniture.—The study of design in furniture; the detail drawing 
and construction of the same, involving the study of joinery, hand-wrought mouldings, 
and enrichment of surfaces by carving. The work is correlated with the courses in 
design and interior decoration. Special departments for woodworking are maintained 
as follows: 
Cincinnati, Ohio.—Ohio Mechanics Institute. 
Re eas N. Y.—Columbia University, department of fine arts of Teachers 
‘ollege. 
New York, N. Y.—Pratt Institute. 
Philadelphia, Pa.—Pennsylvania School of Industrial Art. 
Trenton, N. J.—School of Industrial Arts. 
4. SCHOOLS OF ARCHITECTURE. 
There is no independent school of architecture. The education of 
the architects is cared for in schools which are affiliated with the 
universities. Evening classes for draughtsmen are an important 
part of the work of the architectural clubs scattered throughout the 
country. Most of these are affiliated with the Society of Beaux-Arts 
Architects, which maintains its headquarters in New York City and 
sends its problems to ateliers in 83 cities. The Paris prize estab- 
lished by this society sends a young man to Paris each year, with the 
privilege of attending the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and gives him $250 
quarterly for two and a half years. 
The education of the architect needs to be many-sided; there are 
scientific problems of engineering, material, and estimating, and artis- 
tic questions of design, ornament, interior decoration, including ren- 
dering the drawings and many working plans. In the universities a 
four years’ course in the school of architecture leads to the degree of   
1 The list on page 304 contains only the ateliers with five or more students.
-P-A-G-E-423
  PROFESSIONAL ART SCHOOLS. 385 
bachelor of architecture. It must usually be preceded by two years 
of scientific work in the college. More advanced study leads to the 
degrees of master of arts and doctor of philosophy. The fees in 
architectural schools average $200 for the term of eight months. 
Schools of landscape architecture are of comparatively recent date 
in this country; they are closely connected with the departments of 
horticulture. Drawing and ability to render the design form part 
of the course. Institutions maintaining such schools are: 
Ann Arbor, Mich.—University of Michigan. 
Cambridge, Mass.—Harvard University. 
Groton, Mass.—Lowthorpe School. 
Ithaca, N. Y.—Cornell University. 
Orono, Me.—University of Maine. 
5. NORMAL ART SCHOOLS.! 
From the founding of the first normal schools in the United States ? 
some phase of art instruction has always been included in the course 
of study. The first normal art school was founded in 1873 by an 
act of the Legislature of the State of Massachusetts, and this is still 
the only State art school in the country and the only independent 
normal art school. 
Admission.—Candidates must be over 16 years of age; they must 
present a certificate of moral character and a high-school diploma or 
its equivalent. In addition to this, there is a written examination 
in English, civil government, elementary botany, and physiology, as 
well as the test in drawing. Tuition is free to pupils whose parents 
reside within the State; tuition for students from other States is $50. 
The Massachusetts Normal Art School is organized into 11 depart- 
ments offering definite elective courses of four years’ work. Instruc- 
tion in all courses consists of studio and practical apprentice experience 
in educational and industrial establishments. The courses are: 
I. Applied arts in public schcols—presentation of applied art subjects in classroom 
and workshop. II. Applied design and interior decoration—general and specialized 
design and methods of application. III. Modeling and casting—appreciation of form 
and professional craftsmanship. IV. Graphic arts—technique and processes in illus- 
trative, photographic, and printing arts. V. Drawing and painting—drawing and 
painting the figure. VI. Mechanical drafting—technique, design, and methods of 
shop drafting. VII. Architectural drafting—technique, construction, and methods 
of architectural and structural drafting. VIII. Iron working—technique and methods 
of iron working, forging, bench work, and machine-tool practice. IX. Woodwork- 
ing—technique and methods of woodworking, turning, furniture, and cabinet work, 
pattern making, and carving. X. Metal work and jewelry—technique and methods 
of coppersmithing, silversmithing, enameling, and jewelry. XI. Costume illus- 
tration—technique, methods and combinations in costume illustration and production.

  386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
All other normal art schools are departments of schools of art or of 
normal schools. At the Art Institute of Chicago, Teachers College 
of Columbia University and Pratt Institute in New York, Pennsyl- 
vania School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia, and a few others the 
normal art department is separately organized, with a principal and 
a number of teachers. These schools have the benefit of giving 
instruction in general cultural branches, have an art museum affiliated 
with the school, and other advantages. The courses are similar to 
those of the Massachusetts Normal Art School. 
In the normal schools, drawing is given sometimes for only two or 
three hours a week, while in others there are well-planned courses of 
as many as 20 hours a week for 36 weeks in the year, and other related 
studies are offered. Out of 199 schools with courses for training art 
teachers, 43 offer 10 hours a week or more of drawing and painting.’ 
The summer courses in normal art are among the most important 
offered. They are indicated in the list at the end of this chapter. 
6. ARTISTIC COURSES IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
A special study of the courses in history of art in universities and 
colleges was carried on by a committee of the Western Drawing and 
Manual Training Teachers Association. This committee in 1912 
developed into the College Art Association, which has continued 
investigations along these lines. At the annual convention in Decem- 
ber, 1913, the assertion of Prof. O. S. Tonks, of Vassar College, in a 
paper on ‘‘The Teaching of Art in the College,” that technical work 
in drawing, painting, and modeling, had no place in the college course 
aroused much discussion. A majority of those present favored 
technical work as a laboratory process, supplementing the study of 
the theory, history, and philosophy of «esthetics. Prof. Arthur Pope, 
of Harvard University, gave a detailed and illustrated presentation 
of ‘Drawing and Painting in College Courses”’ as developed at Har- 
vard, wherein he showed that the purpose of these courses was em- 
phasized as cultural rather than professional and as comparable to 
methods of teaching English composition. 
A pamphlet on the ‘‘Study of the History of Art in the Colleges and 
Universities of the United States” (published by Princeton University 
Press), was prepared by E. Baldwin Smith for the tenth International 
Congress of Art Historians, which met in Rome in October, 1912. 
Four hundred institutions were communicated with, and 95 of these 
gave art history, but only 68 adequately—that is, with a special 
chair in art history or archeology. The latest addition to this list   
1See Education Bulletin, 1914, No. 13, “Present Status of Drawing and Art in the Elementary and 
Secondary Schools of the United States.”

  PROFESSIONAL ART SCHOOLS. 3887 
is Columbia University, to which $100,000 was bequeathed by Hugo 
Reisinger in 1914 to found a chair of art history. 
Appreciation is a comparatively new development of the old 
historical method. The facts of names, dates, and periods can be 
found in books, but an appreciation of the esthetic quality of a 
work can be gained much more readily through the spoken word. 
Art appreciation has for some years been treated as a special subject 
in the departmerit of fine arts of Teachers College, Columbia Uni- 
versity, New York. The only other colleges that list a similar course 
are Augustana College, Rock Island, Tll.; Denison University, Gran- 
ville, Ohio; Ohio State University, Columbus; Roanoke College, 
Salem, Va.; and Simmons College, Boston, Mass. 
CONCLUSION, 
A table on the following page summarizes the art schools in the 
United States. It would seem from these enrollment figures that the 
number of young men and women who are attempting to be painters 
of easel pictures and sculptors of monumental works is quite out of pro- 
portion to those who aim to produce beautiful objects for everyday 
use. There is, however, a redeeming feature to this situation. Every 
individual who attempts to draw or model learns to enjoy beauty 
and becomes a sympathetic and appreciative audience for the pro- 
fessional artist. Much is done in the elementary and secondary 
schools in the United States in cultivating the appreciative powers 
and in creating intelligent consumers. Organizations outside the 
school systems have given valuable assistance to the work, the Public 
School Art Society of Chicago and the School Art League of New York 
being the most prominent. 
The art education of the country as a whole lacks coordination. 
We seem to have begun at the wrong end, having many schools 
devoted to academic work in contrast to a few industrial art schools. 
A definite scheme should have: (1) Drawing in the elementary 
schools as a means of developing appreciation; (2) technical ability, 
to be gained in the secondary schools; (3) industrial art schools, 
where design is developed for specialized uses and the technical pro- 
cesses are mastered; (4) academic schools for the few who have 
shown unusual talent. 
In some European cities there is a system of small scholarships 
which gradually eliminates the less talented pupils, but gives continued 
and increasing support to the unusually gifted. The Federal, State, 
and city governments might do much to encourage progress in the 
fine and industrial arts in the United States by establishing some 
similar system of scholarships.

AIM AND SCOPE OF CIVIC EDUCATION. 
A tide of democracy is flooding the country. Remarkable changes 
are occurring in our methods of self-government. The direct primary, 
the initiative and the referendum, the popular election of United States 
Senators, the recall of officials and of judicial decisions, the short bal- 
lot, the extension of woman suffrage, preferential presidential prima- 
ries, proportional representation—these and other innovations in our 
methods of government, while aiming at greater governmental effi- 
ciency, seek this end through a larger degree of popular control. 
However good these devices may be, they will inevitably fall short of 
their purpose unless they are in competent hands. The fundamental 
problem of good government in a democracy is an educational one. 
The mechanism of self-government will be built on crumbling sand 
unless its foundations are laid deep with an effective civic education. 
Coincident with this expanding tide of democracy, a new interest 
in civic education has been developing; but it is a civic education 
with a new content, a new aim, and new methods. The movement 
began with a feeling that the instruction in government in the schools 
and colleges was inadequate; but it is growing, under a conviction 
that no amount of instruction in government will of itself meet the 
demand for a civic education that will afford a real bulwark to our 
democracy. The weakness of democratic government lies in part in 
imperfect devices; in part in a lack of intelligence on the part of the 
citizen; but it lies chiefly in civic apathy, wrong motives, and the 
absence of certain essential qualities of good citizenship. Even in- 
telligence includes more than mere knowledge; and intelligence must 
be supplemented by will if we are to attain the desired ends, even 
with the best of machinery.

402 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The first and most important tendency in civic education at present 
may be represented by the outline following. The portion above the 
dotted line represents, in effect, practically all that has been included 
in civic education in the past. Now the tendency is to lay especial 
emphasis upon the factors indicated below the dotted line. It is in 
these factors that the real safeguard of democracy is to be found. 
Civie Education Aims to Cultivate— 
I. Civic intelligence, which includes— 
1. Civic knowledge. 
2. Power to organize this knowledge with reference to one’s own experience 
and interest. 
8. Judgment, when confronted by a civic situation or by a choice of methods 
of meeting the situation. 
II. Adequate and proper motives for— 
1. Training the civic intelligence. 
2. Civic action. 
III. Various other qualities of good citizenship, such as— 
1. A sense of personal responsibility. 
2. Power of initiative. 
3. A spirit and habit of team work (cooperation). 
A second important tendency in civic education is the projection 
of its organized beginnings back into the early years of life. 
CONTINUITY OF CIVIC EDUCATION. 
A dozen years ago, and earlier, inquiries into the subject of civic 
education were restricted to the field of instruction in colleges and 
universities. Later, attention was directed to the high schools. 
One committee reported, for example, that “in the grammar schools 
very little can be done beyond gaining familiarity with the nomen- 
clature of political science. * * * It is to the high schools of our 
large cities that we must look for the greatest results.’ Recently, 
however, perhaps more definite progress has been made toward 
effective civic training in the elementary schools than anywhere else 
along the line. 
The problem of civic education in secondary schools looms larger 
to-day than ever, but whereas the work of the high schools was for- 
merly little more than an imitation of college courses in government, 
these schools are now tending to take their cue from the elementary 
schools; that is, the principles that have controlled in the recent 
development of elementary civics are being applied in large measure 
to the reorganization of the high-school work. 
Just as high-school civics was once, and still is to a large extent, an 
imitation of college work, so, when it was first conceived that larger 
numbers could be reached by introducing civics into the lower grades,

versities. In others, as in the State of Washington, the State public 
school authorities have taken the initiative. In still others, citizen 
organizations exist as the directing agent, such as the Cooperative 
Education Association of Virginia, which works in conjunction with 
the State board of education, and which has organized school and 
civic leagues throughout the rural districts of the State. In all 
cases, the school building is usually the meeting place, and a move- 
ment seems to be gaining ground for uniting the functions of school 
principals with those of civic secretaries for their districts. 
Tn Virginia, North Carolina, Illinois, Iowa, Washington, Wisconsin, 
and elsewhere, bulletins are issued at intervals by State universities 
and other agencies, suggesting vital topics for discussion, and other- 
wise guiding the movement in their localities. State-wide high 
school and college debating leagues exist in many States. Through 
its county work the Young Men’s Christian Association is taking an 
active part in the movement, and the church is awaking to its oppor- 
tunities and obligations in the same field! Nor may we omit special 
mention of the aggressive work of women’s clubs everywhere, not 
only for self-education, and community education, in civic matters, 
but in the organization of junior civic leagues as an adjunct to, or 
substitute for, the work of the schools in the same field. The junior 
civic league is one of numerous extra-school agencies for children 
that are already working, or have peculiar opportunities to do much, — 
in the cause of civic training. 
The activities and agencies mentioned here are illustrative of a 
widespread movement of great significance in its relation to the 
progress of democracy. The very multiplicity of agencies, however, 
raises the question as to how far some of them have permanent func- 
tions to perform, and how far they are merely temporary expedients, 
pointing the way to functions that should ultimately be performed 
through previously existing, and perhaps official, channels. To 
what extent are these recent developments a result of failure on the 
part of existing agencies to perform their proper functions, and 
doomed to self-extinguishment when the latter shall have assumed 
their full duty? For example, the junior civic league doubtless 
performs a valuable and necessary service; but would the same 
necessity for it exist if the public school were meeting the problem 
of civic education to an extent that is wholly reasonable to expect? 
How far, in other words, should the junior civic league seek to 
establish itself as a permanent institution, and how far should it 
merely seek to point the way to the public school, acting only as a 
temporary substitute for it and stimulus to it? 
1 Witness the surveys made by the department of church and country life of the Presbyterian Church.

  406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
CIVIC EDUCATION THROUGH PARTICIPATION. 
One final characteristic of present-day civic education which must 
be referred to in this partial review is the tendency toward participa- 
tion in civic activities as a means of civic training. Not only is action 
the end of all good citizenship, but it is an invaluable means, as well 
as the end, of all good civic training. If civic education means the 
cultivation of qualities of good citizenship, doing something is really 
more important than instruction or discussion. It is through activity 
that habits are formed, interest kindled and maintained, initiative 
stimulated, and judgment developed. 
It is this idea that lies back of the various schemes of pupil partici- 
pation in school government. They rest on the principle that schools 
whose chief function is to train for efficient membership in a democ- 
racy should themselves be democratic in order that their pupils may 
be trained in habits of self-government. This principle is sound. 
But while some of these experiments have produced remarkably good 
results, others have failed utterly. A plan that has succeeded in one 
case has often been unsuccessful in another. Where the application 
of the idea has failed, it seems to be due to the following principal 
causes: (1) Overconfidence in a particular device for pupil self- 
government as a means of civic training. It is one thing to say that 
pupil participation in schoo] management is an invaluable means of 
civic training; it is an entirely different thing to expect that any 
particular piece of machinery for that purpose constitutes, in itself, 
adequate provision for such training. (2) A second weakness of 
some self-governing experiments lies in their artificiality. This has 
sometimes been the case with plans by which the school is organized 
as a city or a State, with mayors and governors and policemen and 
other officers that properly belong to the larger communities, but not 
to a school. ‘The tendency in such cases is for the children to play 
at governing a city or a State instead of actually managing the reali- 
ties of school life. It is to be remembered that while the school is a 
community, it is a school community, and not a city or a State. (8) 
Another cause of failure of pupil self-governing schemes has been the 
mistaking of one of their incidental results for their primary purpose. 
The real end of pupil self-government is training for citizenship; an 
incidental result should be a better kind of discipline in the school. 
But those who have thought that by introducing some scheme of 
self-government the school would ‘‘take care of itself,’ in the sense 
that teachers and school officers would be relieved of responsibility 
and labor, have been doomed to disappointment. It is true that 
the teacher should be relieved of much petty disciplinary effort; but 
a larger responsibility must take its place. (4) This suggests a fourth 
cause of failure on the part of many self-governing experiments, viz,
-P-A-G-E-443
         THB TREND OF CIVIC EDUCATION. 407 
the failure of the teaching force to understand and enter into the 
social spirit necessary to make any such scheme a real success. In a 
self-eoverning school community the teacher still remains a member, 
and a very important member, of that community. The problem is 
not one of mechanics, but of social spirit, of sympathy, of interest, 
of thorough comprehension of the real meaning of civic life. The 
failure of the teaching body as a whole, through lack of training or 
otherwise, to enter into the spirit of cooperative self-government fore- 
dooms efforts in this direction to certain failure. 
In spite of such difficulties, pupil participation in the control of 
the life of the school is becoming more generally recognized as an 
invaluable means of civic training. The tendency, however, is to 
place less dependence upon devices of organization, and more upon 
the development of a community spirit and a simple community 
cooperation appropriate to the ordinary conditions of school life. 
It should perhaps be said, parenthetically, that the matter of 
dramatizing the proceedings of government, whether of city councils, 
or courts, or State legislatures, as a means of instruction regarding 
such things, is an entirely different question. 
It is the idea of civic training through activity, also, that gives to 
the playground and the school garden their civic educational value. 
It is one of the elements of strength in the boy scouts and in the 
junior civic league. It lies at the foundation of the most advanced 
educational methods, and is the keynote to the new type of civic 
instruction now finding its way into the elementary school. New 
schemes for the participation of children in actual civic enterprises 
outside of the school are appearing almost daily. With all its value, 
however, there is also a danger in this participation by children in 
civic affairs. It requires the best of judgment on the part of those 
who direct it. A recent article in an educational journal described a 
method of civic training that led a little elementary schoolgirl to 
rebuke men on the street for expectorating. Good judgment, at 
least, was lacking in this case. There have been cases where boys 
have bred flies in putrid meat for the sake of winning a prize in a 
fly-swatting campaign. The motive was wrong in such cases. It 
must be borne in mind that the purpose of the school is to educate, 
and not to exploit the children to bring about reforms that the 
established agencies and the more responsible citizens have failed 
to accomplish. 
Civic education has seemed to many to be either a very indefinite 
thing with little that is tangible about it, or else a very particular 
thing of narrow application and of little general interest. Vocational 
education makes a strong appeal to the business man because he can 
seo it in terms of efficiency among his employees, or in terms of ability 
on the part of the boy to find and hold a job. It suggests something    
-P-A-G-E-444
  408 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
very definite and desirable, even though the average citizen probably 
knows little or nothing about the complicated educational problems 
involved in it. It has not been so with civic education. ‘‘Training 
for citizenship” indeed strikes a spark of interest; but so long as it 
meant merely formal instruction in government it savored too much 
of the schoolroom to arouse general interest; and since the revolt 
against this narrow conception began, no clearly defined concept has 
been formulated to take its place. The first necessity, then, is to 
interpret training for citizenship, or civic education, in the light of 
actual tendencies and demands. This task is far from complete, but 
the foregoing partial review may help to define the significance and 
scope of the problem. 
CIVIC EDUCATION OF THE IMMIGRANT. 
One of the conspicuous features of civic education to-day, as shown 
above, is that it comprises a number of related, but nevertheless 
distinct, problems. The more we narrow our view upon one or other 
of these component problems, the more definite they become. As 
we refer to some of these, one thing will stand out conspicuously, 
and that is the extent to which each depends for its solution upon the 
solution of others. 
For example, the effective civic education of the immigrant de- 
pends, among other things, upon the availability of suitable texts or 
other printed matter, and upon properly trained teachers. It 
depends upon the working out of methods by which to reach the 
motives, the interests, the sense of personal responsibility, the 
initiative, as well as the intelligence, of the immigrant. It also de- 
pends in a measure upon whether the immigrant is a city dweller 
or has made his home in a rural district. Every successful piece of 
work that is done in the field of elementary or high-school civies, or in 
civic education for continuation schools, or in rural or urban civics, 
or in the normal schools, will have its suggestion for the successful 
civic education of the immigrant. A successful method of approach- 
ing the problem of the civic education of the immigrant, therefore, 
involves the perspective which is furnished by keeping in mind the 
other special problems included in the comprehensive scheme. It is 
in large measure because this has not always been done that some of 
the special and unrelated schemes for immigrant education have 
proved so inadequate. 
We have been speaking here of the adult immigrant. As for the 
immigrant child, provision for his civic training forms a part of the 
problem of civic education in elementary, secondary, and continuation 
schools. It may be added that one of the most effective channels by 
which to reach the adult immigrant is through his children, which
-P-A-G-E-445
  THE TREND OF CIVIC EDUCATION. 409 
only adds further emphasis to the need of a type of civic education 
in the schools that will enter into the very lives of the pupils. 
Nevertheless, the civic education of the adult immigrant has its 
own peculiar aspects. It requires, first of all, a knowledge of the 
immigrant, and indeed of each group of immigrants. When the 
first ‘‘foreigners” came to America, in the fifteenth and sixteenth cen- 
turies, they interpreted what they found here in terms of their own 
experience. They referred to the adobe communal dwellings of 
Mexico as palaces, and described the barbarous society of that new 
land in terms of emperors, lords, and knights. The disastrous 
results of the contact of these early Europeans with the natives 
were in large measure due to a total misunderstanding between two 
radically different civilizations. The same thing is largely true 
to-day. What would happen, for example, if the native of eastern 
Europe, who in his native land is accustomed to look upon the justice 
of the peace in his little village as his paternal adviser on all sorts of 
questions of daily life, should attempt to follow the same custom 
with the officers with the same title in this country? The civic 
education of the immigrant must be a process by which he is defi- 
nitely helped to make the transition from his European type of com- 
munity life to the American type. He is not a child; he is an adult 
with a definite mental and social heritage. Success in helping him 
depends as much upon understanding what he brings with him as 
it does upon a formal knowledge of our own institutions. 
ELEMENTARY COMMUNITY CIVICS. 
Reference has been made to the extension of civic education into 
the elementary schools. As the result of several years’ attention to 
this problem there have been evolved some very definite concepts as to 
the type of civic education that is best adapted to the needs and 
capacities and interests of children of grammar-school age. The most 
usual form of the new elementary civic education has come to be 
known quite widely as ‘‘community civics.” The aim of ‘‘community 
civies” is to help the pupil ‘‘to know his own community ’’—not 
merely a collection of formal facts about it, but especially the mean- 
ing of his community life, what it does for him and how it does it 
(especially through the channels of government), what the com- 
munity hag a right to expect from him, and how he may fulfill his 
obligation; meanwhile, by various methods, cultivating in the pupil 
the essential qualities and habits of good citizenship. 
“Community civics” inevitably lays much emphasis upon the 
local community and the local civic relations, because (1) it is the 
local community with which every citizen, especially the young 
citizen, comes into most intimate relations and which is almost 
 
-P-A-G-E-446
  
  410 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
always in the foreground of consciousness; and (2) it is easier for the 
child (as for any citizen) to realize his membership in his local com- 
munity, to feel a sense of personal responsibility for it, and to enter 
into active cooperation with it, than is the case with the vast national 
community. It is in connection with the local community life that 
the young citizen most readily forms habits of good citizenship. 
In many localities the more or less systematic study of the im- 
mediate community is now a part of the regular curriculum. Chicago 
affords a notable example of this. Indianapolis was one of the first 
cities to introduce systematic community civics in the grammar 
schools; in fact, it was the work done here that seems to have suggested 
the term ‘‘community civics.” Cincinnati introduced a similar 
course, largely through the influence of her neighbor, Indianapolis. 
Newark, N. J., has for a number of years had a course in ‘‘Newark 
study” in its schools. 
A noteworthy feature of the Newark plan is the cooperation of the 
public library in making available to the pupils and other citizens of 
that city well-selected and abundant printed material relating to every 
phase of Newark’s development and community life. Similar work 
has been done in other cities through the cooperation of other agencies 
with the public schools. In Indianapolis, for example, the com- 
mercial club cooperated with the board of education in the publica- 
tion of pamphlets relating to the history and government of that city. 
Several years earlier the Chicago Normal College issued some such 
material, including the story of ‘‘The Fight for Life in Chicago,” 
which was an account of the development of Chicago’s means of 
health protection. At the present time the Chicago Normal College 
is publishing in the Educational Bi-Monthly a series of articles on 
“The History and Government of Chicago.” In a few instances 
local textbooks are being prepared for the use of the local schools. 
The emphasis given to the local community for the reasons given 
above seems to tend in some cases to obscure the real significance of 
the term ‘‘community civics.’ The significance of this term does not 
lie in its geographical implications, but in its implication of com- 
munity interests, community relations, community cooperation 
through government. The term should by no means exclude the 
national or the State concept. The Nation and the State are as 
truly communities as is the town or city, and their governments are 
as really means by which the citizens may cooperate as in the case of 
local governments. A study of one’s local community may be as 
lifeless and as devoid of the real spirit of community civics as the old 
formal study of the machinery of the Federal Government. On the 
other hand, the spirit of community civics may be made thoroughly 
to infuse the study of the Nation or the State.

THE TREND OF CIVIC EDUCATION. All 
PREPARATION OF THE TEACHER. 
In the field of elementary civic education we are brought. sharply 
up against the problem of the preparation of the teacher for this vital 
type of work. One of the urgent needs is for a teaching force better 
trained on the civic side. This suggests the necessity for a vitalized 
type of civic education in institutions that train teachers, including 
the high school, the normal training school, and the college. The 
high-school problem will be referred to later. In the training schools 
for teachers there is the-greatest need for something more vital than 
the formal courses and examinations in government that have pre- 
vailed heretofore. A valuable suggestion may be found in the work 
of the State Normal School at Athens, Ga. This is described in full 
in Bulletin, 1913, No. 23, Bureau of Education. The following quota- 
tions suggest the spirit and method of the work there: 
The final justification of public taxation for public education lies in the training of 
the young people for citizenship. Ifa public institution is not doing this, it has no 
reason for existence, at least no claim upon the public purse. * * * 
The Georgia Club believesthat an institution supported by the State ought thoroughly 
to know the Commonwealth that gives it life; that it ought to adjust its work to the 
needs of the State, acquaint its students with the resources and possibilities of the 
State, and breed in them the wisdom, the willingness, and the skill that the Common- 
wealth has a right to expect from her sons and daughters. 
The Georgia Club may be said to have stumbled into the discovery that the home 
State and the home county are proper subjects of school study; that exact information 
about one’s own community and people arouses sympathetic concern and civic con- 
science, and therefore furnishes a definite and sure foundation for social service and 
efficient citizenship. j 
And so the Georgia Club speedily settled down into a faithful study of the near, the 
here, and the now, the significance of the community occupations and businesses, the 
forces and agencies that are offering obstacles or creating opportunities in the field of 
social service to which as teachers we are consecrating ourselves. 
What is needed seems to be not formal insulated textbook courses in economics and 
sociology; * * * but direct, first-hand, sympathetic experience with the worka- 
day world of men; the dyeing of our hands, the steeping of our minds in the affairs of 
community life—business, civic, social, and religous. 
The club members here will be teachers, but few of them will be teachers merely; 
they will be leaders as well in every kind of progressive community enterprise. 
The mere teacher ought to go out of existence. The State does not need teachers 
merely, but teachers who are citizens and patriots as well. The club develops leader- 
ship as well as teachership. 
A number of school superintendents have expressed their conviction 
that the schools of large communities, at least, should have super- 
visors or directors of civic education, one of whose first duties would 
be to serve as the connecting link between the teaching body and the 
realities of the community life and who would lead conferences among 
the teachers relative to the facts regarding the community and the 
methods by which the civic consciousness and civic habits of the 
pupils may be cultivated.
-P-A-G-E-448
  412 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
There is a widespread demand at present on the part of school 
authorities and teachers for literature that will suggest concretely 
methods by which civic education may be vitalized, largely derived 
from the experience of successful teachers. The Bureau of Educa- 
tion is attempting to meet this demand as far as possible. 
CIVIC EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The problem of civic education in the high school is of peculiar 
importance. The high school is in part, though only in part, a 
preparatory school for the college. The work that it does can not 
be college work, though in its organization the needs of the pupil 
who goes to college must be kept in mind. The college problem, as 
well as the high-school problem, is greatly complicated by the absence 
of the proper kind of articulation between the two grades of insti- 
tution. As has been suggested above, the civics work of the high 
school has been too largely an imitation of the college course, and too 
little a preparation for it. Though the college men have themselves 
been largely responsible for the character of the courses in history 
and government given in the high schools, they are now coming to 
recognize that what the college entrant needs is not so much a mass 
of facts about government as a correct point of view, a right attitude, 
an interest, and a motive. 
On the other hand, the majority of high-school pupils do not go 
to college. Their work is not in preparation for a college course, 
but for active participation in life. On the civic side of this prepara- 
tion it is also coming to be recognized that the formal study of gov- 
ernment and of history heretofore prevailing is inadequate. Here 
again, while a certain appreciation of civic facts within the mental 
‘capacity of pupils of high-school age is necessary, underlying this 
is the necessity for a point of view, an attitude, an interest, and a 
‘motive. Further, the point of view, the attitude, the interést, and 
the motives that really prepare the student for college entrance are 
also those that give the best preparation for civic life. 
It is on this side of methods of cultivating right attitude, interest, 
motive, and right habits of civic thought and action, that the high 
school is learning from and building upon the “new civics’ as 
applied to the elementary school. On the side of content, the high 
school is drawing upon the college and university subjects to a 
greater extent than formerly. Good citizenship depends not only 
upon knowledge of government, but also upon a broadly sociological 
viewpoint, and a knowledge of the social and economic relations 
that underlie government. Therefore sociology and political econ- 
omy, as well as political science and history, are now drafted into 
the service of the high school in training for citizenship.
-P-A-G-E-449
THE TREND OF CIVIC EDUCATION. 413 
At this point appear certain possible dangers. First, there is the 
danger of doing with these other subjects what was formerly done 
in the case of government, viz, carrying over into the high-school 
courses that are adapted only to the college or university. Second, 
there is the ever-present danger of overloading the high-school 
curriculum. The historical enthusiast has been diligent in seeking 
to extend the time allotment of history; the political scientist urges 
more attention to government as such; political economy as a 
separate subject has its advocates, as has also sociology. The advo- 
cates of the last-named science are divided into at least two camps, 
those who favor the more or less abstract and theoretical treatment 
of the subject, and those who would make of it a course in “social 
service” or philanthropy. The real problem whose solution is 
urgent at the present time is how to make all these fields of knowledge 
contribute effectively to the civic education of the high-school pupil 
without overloading the course of study and without transforming 
the high school into a college. 
One of the committees of the commission on the reorganization 
of secondary education appointed by the National Education Asso- 
ciation in 1913 is the committee on social studies, which include 
history, civics, and economics. This committee has been, and still 
is, diligently working at this problem of civic education in its broad 
sense. One report of this committee was issued by the Bureau of 
Education as Bulletin, 1913, No. 41. A second report has been 
submitted in manuscript, and a final report will be issued in the near 
future. 
CIVIC EDUCATION IN COLLEGES. 
With reference to the trend of civic education in the colleges and 
universities, perhaps the most significant feature is the increasing 
attention given to training for public service as a profession. In 
addition to a multiplicity of general and special courses in political 
science, political economy, and sociology, departments are being 
added in an increasing number of institutions for the practical study 
of legislative and administrative methods with a view to training 
experts or leaders in civic life. This and other influences are tending 
to make of public service a career to be prepared for as are the careers 
of law, or medicine, or business. To prepare for such professional 
service in civic life is one of the proper functions of the university. 
Only a small percentage of the students of the colleges and uni- 
yersities will engage in public service as a profession, however. 
The great majority are to be business or professional men, absorbed 
for the most part in the affairs of private life. Nevertheless, it is 
these college graduates to whom democracy should be able to look 
for leadership in thought and action in the ranks, and, as occasion 
arises, in public position.  
-P-A-G-E-450
ee fee ne nee ene ne ee 
414 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
To give the coming professional or business men or farmers some 
preparation for this lay leadership, the colleges and universities are 
offering increasing opportunities in the form of a wide variety of 
courses in sociology, economics, or political science, in the hope that 
a certain portion of the students will somewhere in the course find 
opportunity to elect some subject of a social or civic character. 
Nevertheless, one of, the questions discussed most earnestly by 
national conferences of college teachers of these subjects is, How 
can we arouse greater interest in these subjects and in civic matters 
generally, on the part of larger numbers of students ? 
One device resorted to in the hope of increasing the general interest 
of students in civic matters, and incidentally in the civic or social 
subjects, is the organization of civic or good-government clubs. 
Such clubs exist in a considerable number of colleges, and in some 
cases at least afford valuable support to the regular work of the 
curriculum. Yet in six institutions visited this year in which stich 
clubs existed the clubs included a total membership of less than 100 
out of an aggregate student enrollment of about 12,000. 
In the University of North Carolina, however, there is a North 
Carolina Club (similar to the Georgia Club at the State Normal School 
at Athens, Ga.) which is itself a federation of ‘‘Home-county clubs,” 
the latter being clubs of students from the several counties of the 
State. Each of these clubs is making an intimate, concrete study of 
the conditions and problems of its home county—social, economic, 
political. Through the federation, the results of the work of the 
several county clubs are brought together into an organized mass of 
first-hand knowledge about the State of North Carolina. From these 
clubs there will go back into every section of the State farmers, busi- 
ness and professional men, school-teachers, and housekeepers, with a 
knowledge of local and State conditions, and, what is more important, 
an interest in their own civic life. One of the secrets of the success 
-of the North Carolina and Georgia plans is that the students are not 
studying, primarily, abstract economic and political and social ques- 
tions, but are learning ‘to know their own community” in its relation 
to their own interests. On the basis of such work the broader and 
more abstract principles of political and economic life acquire new 
interest, and the departments of the university devoted to these 
subjects are expanding as might be expected. 
A further partial answer, however, to the question how to interest 
larger numbers of college students in the social and civic subjects will 
doubtless be found in the reorganized civic work of the elementary 
and, especially, of the secondary schools, by which a point of view, an 
attitude, an interest, and a motive, will be cultivated, that will lead 
the college entrant to want to know more of the subjects which the 
higher institutions are offering with increasingly liberal hand.

THE TREND OF CIVIC EDUCATION. : 415 
CIVIC ASPECTS OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
By cultivating efficiency in the economic life of the community, 
vocational education contributes to the civic training of the pupil. 
Nevertheless, vocational education may be essentially selfish or 
uncivic in its character. That is, its motive may be to enable the 
individual worker, or the individual employer, to satisfy his own 
economic interests without due regard to the interests of others, or 
of the community as a whole. A program of civic education must 
include provision for vocational training; but, on the other hand, 
sound vocational education not only affords unusual opportunity for 
civic training of the most practical and far-reaching character, but 
demands that such civic training be given. 
The broader civic aspects and opportunities of vocational education 
have so far received comparatively little attention, but they are now 
forcing their way into the foreground. The new law establishing 
continuation schools in Wisconsin, for example, requires that in them 
“citizenship” shall be taught. The questions as to what should con- 
stitute a course in citizenship in a vocational school, how it should 
differ from a course in citizenship in the ordinary high school, if at all, 
and how it may be related most directly and most effectively to the 
main purpose of such schools, are demanding answers. A similar 
situation exists in Boston and elsewhere. The Bureau of Education 
includes attention to this phase of civic education in its plans for the 
coming year. 
CIVIC EDUCATION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. 
One of the greatest educational problems of the present is that of 
reorganizing and redirecting rural education. This is a part of the 
still broader problem of the readjustment of rural life to meet the 
changing conditions of the times. The rural educational problem 
involves that of providing adequate instruction and training to enable 
the child, or the adult, for that matter, to understand his rural com- 
munity and his relations to it, and to take his place effectively in his 
community life. The solution of this problem involves many things— 
first of all, of course, an understanding of the significance and nature 
of the changes that are so profoundly affecting rural life. It involves, 
again, the question of suitable texts and other printed material which, 
of course, must be quite different from those required for the civic 
education of the foreigner. Few textbooks exist that are really suit- 
able for vital work in civics, and probably there is none that is adapted 
to the peculiar needs of the rural community. Federal and State 
Governments, through their departments of agriculture and other 
channels, issue much good material; but comparatively little of it is 
really in available form. We also come back to the problem of the
-P-A-G-E-452
  416 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
teacher, which is a much more serious matter in the country than in 
the city. This brings us again to the work of the high school, the 
normal school, the college, and the summer school, and to the distri- 
bution of suitable literature devoted to the immediate problems of 
the rural school and community. 
COOPERATION IN BEHALF OF CIVIC EDUCATION. 
8 
These are some of the more important aspects and tendencies of 
civic education at the present time. The subject can not be closed, 
however, without reference to the increasing interest and activity, on 
the part of many widely different educational and civic organizations 
in all parts of the country, in the promotion of effective civic educa- 
tion. Heretofore these organizations have worked along their 
respective lines, largely independent of each other. One of the most 
promising tendencies at present is that toward organized cooperation 
among many of these agencies through a common channel. During 
the last year the committee on civic education of the National Munici- 
pal League took the initiative for the establishment of a “clearing 
house,” through which information should be gathered on every phase 
of the subject, thus making available to all who are working in this 
field the best thought and experience to be found anywhere relating 
to the problem as a whole or in its parts. With the cooperation of 
this committee, the Bureau of Education has established a Division 
of Civic Education, which has undertaken to perform the clearing- 
house function referred to. A number of organizations are now 
cooperating through its channels, including the National Municipal 
League, the National Education Association, the American Political - 
Science Association, the Committee on Immigrants in America, 
women’s clubs, and others. Cooperation has also been established 
with school authorities, normal schools, universities and colleges, and 
teachers in every part of the country. The Division of Civic Edu- 
cation of course has the advantage of close cooperation with the other 
divisions of the bureau, such as those of higher, secondary, rural, 
vocational, and home education, the Division of School Gardens, ete. 
That the work of this division meets a real need is clearly indicated 
by the generous and appreciative response to its efforts from the 
schools and others interested in the development of a better citizen- 
ship.

CHAPTER XIX. 
NEGRO EDUCATION. 
By Tuomas Jesse JONES, 
Specialist, Bureau of Education. 
ConTENTS.—State supervisors—The Jeanes fund—Teacher training—Educational meetings—Church 
poards and private donations—New educational buildings—Cooperation. 
Material progress in the two chief problems of Negro education— 
better trained teachers and more helpful supervision—was made 
during the past year. In Virginia, Kentucky, and Arkansas, where 
State supervisors of Negro schools have been longest at work, the 
effectiveness of their efforts is constantly increasing. Results in 
these States have been so encouraging that the Genoral Education 
Board, cooperating with the State departments of education, has now 
placed supervisors in the States of Alabama, North Carolina, and 
Georgia. Tennessee has also decided to appoint a special supervisor 
of Negro schools. The Jeanes fund county teachers, in their visits to 
rural schools, not only supervise the industrial work of the school, 
but also aid the teachers in other ways. The Phelps-Stokes fund 
makes appropriations to the work of the Jeanes fund, and, in coopera- 
tion with the Bureau of Education, is inaugurating a plan for a bureau 
of information concerning private schools. The Slater fund is 
interesting itself more and more in: the training of teachers, par- 
ticularly in the encouragement of county teacher-training schools, 
whose aim is to supply teachers to rural schools. These agencies work 
together in every way possible and are constantly evolving new plans 
for supplementing each other. 
STATE SUPERVISORS. 
The following brief statement sums up the activities of the State 
supervisors: 
(1) The promotion of a practical education, by lending aid to 
county supervising teachers in their organization of industrial classes, 
by organizing boys and girls into agricultural clubs, and by encourag- 
ing the purchase and cultivation of small plats of land for school 
gardens.

(2) The improvement of present school facilities by the con- 
solidation of rural schools and the proper classification and gradation 
of all schools, by the organization of school improvement leagues, 
and by interesting the white people of the community in the work of 
the school. 
(3) The improvement of teachers by developing the teacher- 
training work of State normal schools, by devoting attention to State 
and county teachers’ meetings, and by personally promoting among 
the teachers a spirit of service. 
From this wide range of activities each supervisor has selected the 
activities most suitable to the State in which he is employed. An 
exhaustive survey of the schools of three counties in Alabama was 
made by the supervisor of rural schools and the supervisor of Negro 
schools in order to obtain detailed knowledge of conditions. Every 
school in the three counties was visited. The consideration given 
to the Negro schools was as complete as that given to the white schools. 
In most cases the visit was made in company with the county superin- 
tendent. An effort was made to impress the facts about the school 
upon some patron and upon the teacher, so that an intelligent local 
interest in the school would be created. Later the knowledge will be 
used to improve the county educational systems. 
In Arkansas detailed statistics concerning the public schools for 
Negroes were collected and special attention was given to teachers’ 
meetings and institutes. Arkansas is active in building new school- 
houses for Negroes, and the supervisor gives invaluable suggestions 
as to plans for the buildings and grounds. 
In Georgia the supervisor adopted the new plan of having a special 
Jeanes fund teacher assist him in his work. As these State super- 
visors have a whole State to cover, they can not spend much time in 
one place. Accordingly, it was considered wise to have a teacher 
stop for a week or two in the county to stimulate the interest which 
had been aroused in school improvement and industrial work by the 
supervisor’s visit. 
The work of the North Carolina supervisor was concentrated on 
the 19 counties that have county supervisors. He visited all of these 
counties except one, spending several days in county, township, and 
community meetings. Mr. Newbold, the supervisor, reports that he— 
has been able to organize 13 counties for the purpose of developing home-makers’ 
club work. The counties cooperated with the General Education Board, each giving 
$50 or more to the work. The traveling supervisor for this work in Virginia was se- 
cured to visit each of the 13 supervisors in North Carolina to help them in the pre- 
liminary stages of their work. 
At a demonstration conference held May 26-27, 1914, in Raleigh, 
N. C., these home-making club agents or supervisors received special

instruction in their work from a representative of the Bureau of 
Plant Industry. 
A course of study for public and private Negro schools has also 
been worked out, following a conference of the leading school men in 
the State. It is expected that another conference will be held to 
discuss this course of study before it is presented to the schools for 
adoption. 
In Kentucky and Virginia school improvement and industrial su- 
pervision have developed steadily. In the States that have had 
supervisors longest, as well as in the States where the supervisors 
aro just beginning their work, the confidence of both whites and 
Negroes has been won. 
THE JEANES FUND. 
The Jeanes fund is now in its fifth year. No additions have been 
mado to the fund except an appropriation of $2,500 to its work from 
the Phelps-Stokes fund. The plan of the Georgia supervisor for 
having a Jeanes fund teacher assist the State supervisor gives promise 
of development. The Jeanes fund divides its work as follows:

TEACHER TRAINING. 
        
      The Slater fund, in cooperation with county superintendents, is 
fostering teacher-training schools whose object is the inexpensive 
training of Negro teachers in the county where the teachers live. 
The schools are parts of the public-school system. A sufficient num-    
-P-A-G-E-456
   
     
420 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
ber of these schools would supply .a far stronger teaching force for 
the Negro rural schools. Conditions of service, small pay, and short 
term of school now make it practically impossible to secure teachers 
from outside the county to teach in public schools. The result is 
that many of the positions in county schools are filled by teachers 
whose schooling is little better than that of the pupils they teach. 
The plan of strengthening a county school by adding teacher-training 
subjects to its curriculum was first tried in Tangipahoa Parish, La. 
The superintendent felt the need of better teachers and decided to 
train them at home. He interested the Slater fund in his plan, and 
results were so satisfactory that the fund is now aiding four such 
schools and has promised to aid others—four in North Carolina, three 
in Arkansas, and several in other Southern States. That educators 
think well of the plan is indicated by the following opinions selected 
from a number recently published by Dr. James H. Dillard. 
Supt. Luther Elrod, Jackson County, Ga.: 
We have already begun something of that kind in our county. * * * The board 
of education has recently erected a building at a cost of something like $1,000. They 
erected it for the use of a white school, but it was discontinued after the first year. 
Near this, not more than a quarter of a mile, is a Negro school of a hundred or more 
pupils. It is my purpose to convert this new house into an industrial school for 
Negroes. I have planned also to get some land that surrounds the building for an 
experiment farm. The State college at Athens will cooperate with us in having this 
conducted on a scientific basis. 
Former State Supt. Henry J. Willingham, Alabama: 
The idea, in my opinion, is a most excellent one; by judicious management such a 
school can probably be maintained without additional machinery in a considerable 
number of counties of Alabama. The county boards, of course, hold the strategic 
point in bringing about such an arrangement. With the beginning of next year’s 
work under the new law in this State allowing county boards to employ assistants to 
the county superintendent, this additional feature will be brought to their attention 
in the hope of accomplishing something along the line suggested 
State Supt. J. Y. Joyner, North Carolina: 
T approve most heartily of your suggestion of a county industrial training school for 
Negro teachers. Certainly one of the most serious obstacles to progress in the Negro 
schools is the inefficiency of the teachers. The salaries paid them in most counties 
will not command well-trained teachers, and home provision for inexpensive training 
of the county teaching force, such as you suggest, is in my opinion both wise and 
practical. 
In addition to the stimulus to teacher-training schools, there has 
been an increased interest in teachers’ meetings and institutes. In 
Arkansas five industrial summer normals were held, enrolling 750 
teachers; in North Carolina monthly letters of progress have been 
issued to the supervisors, and a meeting was held December, 1913, 
in which the leading educators of the State discussed at length
-P-A-G-E-457
  NEGRO EDUCATION, 421 
plans for improvement of Negro teachers. Kentucky reports that 
every county in the State having a considerable number of Negro 
teachers must hold a teachers’ institute of one week’s duration. The 
other States are becoming more or less actively interested in summer 
schools for Negroes. Appropriations were made in Georgia, Alabama, 
and Louisiana for this work. In some instances the State appro- 
priation is supplemented by the Slater fund. Many of the private 
schools also hold summer sessions. 
The following list of summer schools is’ furnished by Monroe N. 
Work, of Tuskegee Institute: 
Institute for Colored Youths, Cheyney, Pa.; North Carolina Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, Greensboro, N. C.; National Religious Training School, Durham, 
N. C.; Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio; Lane College, Jackson, Tenn.; 
Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Ala.; West Virginia Colored Institute, Institute, W. 
Va.; Christiansburg Institute, Christiansburg, Va.; Virginia Union University, Rich- 
mond, Va.; Hampton Institute, Hampton, Va.; Summer School for Negro Ministers, 
under the auspices of Nashville Institute for Negroes, Nashville, Tenn.; Bowling 
Green, Mo.; State Normal Agricultural and Industrial School, Nashville, Tenn.; St. 
Paul Normal and Industrial Institute, Lawrenceville, Va.; Thyne Institute, Chase 
City, Va.; Princess Anne Academy, Princess Anne, Md.; Fort Valley Normal and 
Industrial School, Fort Valley, Ga.; Agricultural and Mechanical College, Orangeburg, 
8. C.; Prairie View Normal and Industrial College, Prairie View, Tex. State-aided 
summer schools were held as follows: Little Rock, Hope, Pine Bluff, Brinkley, and 
Dermott, Ark.; Austin, Clarksville, Dallas, Waco, Terrell, Atlanta, Mexia, and Fort 
Worth, Tex.; and an institute in each county in Alabama. 
EDUCATIONAL MEETINGS. 
November 12, 1913, the third annual session of the Conference of 
Negro Land-grant colleges was held in Washington, D. C., in connec- 
tion with the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and 
Experimental Stations. Among the subjects discussed were: ‘What 
shall we expect of these schools?” ‘‘Place of agriculture in our 
system of education.” ‘‘What are individual schools doing?” 
State teachers’ associations were held during the year as follows: 
Montgomery, Ala.; Atlanta, Ga.; Louisville, Ky.; New Orleans, La.; 
Jefferson City, Mo.; Tulsa, Okla,; West Tennessee Educational Con- 
gress; Negro Teachers’ Association and School Improvement League 
of Virginia; Conference of Principals and Teachers of Secondary 
Schools of Virginia. 
In 1914 the principal meeting was the National Association for 
Teachers in Colored Schools which met at Savannah, Ga., July 30 to 
August 2. This meeting was one of the largest and most enthusiastic 
ever held by the association. The National Negro Educational Con- 
gress met in Oklahoma City, July 7-10. In connection with the 
Sixteenth Conference for Education in the South there were two 
special conferences on the Negro, held at Richmond, Va., April 15-18.
-P-A-G-E-458

422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The conferences were presided over by Dr. James H. Dillard, presi- 
dent of the Negro Rural School Board, and were— 
attended by white school officials, including superintendents of public instruction, 
Siate supervisors of industrial and elementary schools, school principals, members of 
educational boards and workers in the United States Bureau of Education, as well as 
by colored school officers. 
The spirit of the conference was— 
characterized by a frank discussion of the best methods of helping Negro boys and. 
girls to better living, better farming, and better home making through the medium of 
the common schools. Northerners, southerners, white men, and black men came 
together on the platform of better schools for the South. 
A similar conference was held at the 1914 meeting of the Southern 
| Educational Association. A new movement for race cooperation was 
| inaugurated at the Young Men’s Christian Association student con- 
| ference presided over by Dr. John R. Mott. Cooperation of church 
| and school and of white and Negro religious and educational leaders 
was stressed. 
| CHURCH BOARDS AND PRIVATE DONATIONS. 
  | No large donations or increases in the annual appropriations to 
| denominational schools were made during the past year. The 
American Missionary Association, under the management of the Con- 
gregational Church, started a campaign for a million-dollar offering 
| as an emancipation jubilee endowment fund for the higher educational 
; institutions connected with the associations. The Freedmen’s Aid 
| Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church also started a campaign 
| for a half-million dollars for its schools, $100,000 to be raised in col- 
| ored conferences and $400,000 in white conferences. The denomi- 
| national boards are, however, strengthening their work by mutual 
| aid. The agents of the American Church Institute for Negroes, the 
| American Missionary Association, the Presbyterian Board of Missions 
for Freedmen, the Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, the American Baptist Home Missionary Society, the Jeanes 
and Slater Funds, and the Phelps-Stokes Fund met in Pittsburgh for 
the third time. Their plan is to work out the details of cooperation 
| so that much duplication in their work for Negroes will be eliminated. 
Of the private donations to Negro education during the year, prob- 
ably the most significant was the offer of Mr. Julius Rosenwald to 
duplicate, up to $600, the money raised in any rural district in the 
South for a Negro school building. Mrs. Elizabeth Ellicott, of Balti- 
more, Md., by the terms of her will, probated May 20, 1914, provided 
that her estate, valued at $150,000, should after the death of her 
husband be devoted to the establishment of a school for the educa- 
tional and social training of the colored race of the State of Maryland.

  NEGRO EDUCATION. 423 
By the terms of the will of Miss Lucy Belknap, of Louisville, Ky., 
$10,000 has been set aside to be spent for the education of colored 
girls in the city of Louisville. 
NEW EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS. 
The strong interest in Negro public and private schools is evidenced 
in the list furnished by Monroe N. Work, of Tuskegee Institute, of 
new school and library buildings erected and planned during the past 
year. 
Public schools.—In Washington, D. C., money has been provided for a new $250,000 
building for Normal School No. 2; also for a new colored high school. The Cuyler 
Street public school, Savannah, Ga.; cost $55,000. The city council of Petersburg, 
Va., voted $100,000 to build two new colored schools. In March, a report from Nash- 
ville, Tenn., stated that a $200,000 high-school building had been promised the colored 
people by the school authorities. At Norfolk, Va., the school board appropriated 
$34,922 for a new colored school building. In Fanwood Township, N. J., $15,500 was 
appropriated for a 4-room school building for colored people. At Method, N. C., a 
$7,600 training school for Negroes has been erected; $1,200 of this amount was raised 
by colored people; the Jeanes Fund gives the equipment and will pay the salaries of 
~he industrial teachers. The school board of Marion, Ark., special school district, 
accepted plans for a concrete and brick building for a negro schoolhouse that is to cost 
approximately $6,000. Within the last two years the Negroes of Caroline County, Va., 
have built twenty-two 3-room ungraded schools to cost $1,200 each, and one 3-room 
graded school costing $1,800. There are under construction three other schools to be 
ready for use this autumn; two are 2-room schools costing $1,200, and the other is a 
4-room building costing $2,500. 
Private schools.—A dining hall with a seating capacity of 500 is being erected at 
West Virginia Institute for Colored Youth. The Woman’s Christian Missionary 
Society of Indianapolis has purchased 200 acres of land at Hopkinsville, Ky., on which 
an industrial school is to be established. The Baptist association at Saluda, S. C., 
purchased 18% acres of land on which is to be located a normal industrial high school. 
At West Falls Church, Va., the corner stone of the Providence Heights Industrial and 
Agricultural School for colored people was laid. At Birmingham, Ala., there is being 
established the Birmingham Baptist College. On September 16, the Central Park 
Normal and Industrial Institute was opened near Savannah, Ga. This institution is 
under the auspices of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Memphis, Tenn., 
has been selected for the location of the proposed Negro Baptist theological seminary 
which is being established:by the Southern Baptist Association, white, in cooperation 
with the National Baptist Convention, colored. The various societies and organiza- 
tions of the Roman Catholic Church are carrying on an active educational campaign 
among the Negroes of both the North and South. The Sisterhood of the Blessed Sacra- 
ment, Miss Drexel, mother superior, has just opened a $100,000 parochial school in the 
Harlem District, New York. This is reported to be one of four schools that are to 
be opened. The others are to be in Boston, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. This will 
make a total of 16 schools that Mother Drexel has founded. At Tipton, Mo., an $80,000 
building is being erected for the State Industrial Home for Negro Girls. 
Library buildings —In Houston, Tex., a $15,000 Carnegie library for colored people 
was opened. Mr. Andrew Carnegie has given $25,000 for the erection of a building for 
the colored branch of the Carnegie library at Nashville, Tenn., and $10,000 for a 
building for a colored library at Greensboro, N ©. The Eastern Colored Branch Pub- 
lic Library at Louisville, Ky., has been opened. The site for this building cost
-P-A-G-E-460
  424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
$5,000, of which sum $4,000 was paid by the city and $1,000 by the colored citizens. 
The buildings cost $22,674. A colored Carnegie library costing $12,000 has been 
opened in Savannah, Ga., and work has been begun on a colored Carnegie library in 
New Orleans, La. 
COOPERATION. 
It is especially significant that while the Negroes are doing more and 
more for themselves in the way of raising money for schools and 
interesting themselves in educational meetings, the agencies mentioned 
above are greatly increasing their efficiency by cooperating with one 
another and by urging cooperation of white people and Negroes for 
school improvement. Especially noteworthy in this respect are the 
efforts of the denominational boards to reach a working agreement 
with one another; the increasing tendency of special funds for Negro 
education to be directed by local school authorities; the increased 
attendance of white school officials on meetings where Negro educa- 
tion is discussed; and the efforts of the State supervisors of Negro 
schools to interest the local school authorities and prominent local 
citizens in public schools for the colored race.

I, THE PROBLEM. 
INABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH. 
In 1910 there were 2,953,011 foreign-born white persons in the 
United States 10 years of age and over unable to speak the English 
language, i. e., 22.8 per cent of the entire foreign-born population in 
this country. Of those 21 years and over, 2,565,212, or 22 per cent 
of our foreign-born white population, were so disqualified. Between 
the ages of 15 and 20 there were 330,994. In urban communities 22 
per cent, as against 25.2 per cent in rural communities, were unable 
to speak English. New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachu- 
setts, Ohio, New Jersey, Texas, Wisconsin, and Michigan each have 
over 100,000. New York State leads with 597,012. In the city of 
New York alone 421,951 persons are laboring under this disability, 
while in the eight principal cities of the United States the number 
totals 833,404. During the period 1900 to 1910 the number of white 
persons of foreign birth admitting inability to speak English in- 
creased 1,735,731. 
Inability to speak English is obviously a barrier to friendly inter- 
course between Americans and foreigners. It affects to a large 
extent the employment of the foreign born; also their assimilation, 
since no foreign-born person can become a citizen of the United 
States until he speaks the English language. The importance of 
425 
 
-P-A-G-E-462
  426 EDUCATION REPORT,’ 1914. 
removing this obstacle to naturalization and assimilation therefore 
requires the attention of legislatures and educators. It is the point 
at which immigrant education must begin. 
ILLITERACY OF FOREIGN-BORN WHITES. 
Illiteracy is a serious obstacle to the foreign born in his ability to 
acquire English. In 1910, the number of illiterate foreign-born 
whites 10 years of age and over was 1,650,361; more than one-half 
of them unable to speak English. It is a reasonable presumption 
that almost all of these illiterates were non-English-speaking.1 Of 
the foreign-born white population 12; per cent can not read or write 
in any language. ‘This is true of but 3 per cent of the native white 
population. Of the males 21 years of age and over, 113%; per cent, or 
788,631, are illiterate. In New York alone 362,025 persons 10 
years of age and over can not read or write. Pennsylvania, Mas- 
sachusetts, and Illinois follow in the order named, with over 100,000 
each. Over 245,000 are under this handicap in New York City. 
Thus the city, State, and Nation are confronting a definite condition 
of illiteracy among the foreign-born whites. 
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
The foregoing facts are especially significant as affecting school 
attendance. Only 651,506 foreign-born whites attended school in 
1909-10, i. e., 3.6 per cent. The greatest number attending school 
belong to the class from 10 to 14 years of age; from 15 to 20 years of 
age, slightly over 102,000 attended; and for 21 years and over, only 
35,614. In other words, against 358,330 of the first group, of whom 
56,405 did not speak English, 308,492 attended school. Against the 
932,274 of the second group, of whom 330,994 did not speak English, 
only 102,639 attended school. Of the last group, against 2,565,612 
unable to speak the language, only 35,000, or 1.3 per cent, attended 
school. 
Immigrant education deals with two_classes—child and adult. 
The first is of minor significance, since compulsory attendance upon 
public schools is general. Special attention upon the part of the 
teacher will give the child a command of English sufficient to give 
him a grading. Education can then take the same course as with 
the native child. The real problem begins at the age of 16. Beyond 
this point, with one exception, compulsory-education laws do not 
apply. With the minor between the ages of 10 and 21 years there 
is some tendency to study English or secure industrial training; 
but with the adult immigrant aptitude and desire for instruction 
are less decided, habits of thought are more fixed, and ability to 
acquire languages largely lost. In the education of the latter class 
special difficulties are presented.   
1 No figures are available to substantiate this presumption.

PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 427 
Il. LEGISLATION AFFECTING IMMIGRANT EDUCATION, 
The types of schools adapted to the education of the immigrant 
are evening, industrial, part-time, and camp schools. Provisions 
creating and maintaining such facilities show the beginnings of new 
State policies on the subject. 
NEW JERSEY’S DIRECT METHOD. 
The most definite legislation for foreigners is to be found in New 
Jersey. In 1907, before the subject of adult immigrant education had 
been much discussed, the legislature passed a law, providing that— 
the board of education of any school district may establish and maintain a public 
evening school or evening schools for the instruction of foreign-born residents of said 
district over 14 years of age in the English language and in the form of government 
and the laws of this State and of the United States. 
With the idea in mind of insuring uniformity of administration 
and instruction, provision was made that the State board of educa- 
tion in preference to local authority— 
shall prescribe rules for the proper control and management of such schools, for the 
inspection thereof, for the granting of certificates to teach therein, and for carrying 
into effect the purposes of this act. The course of study in each of such schools and 
any changes therein shall be submitted to and shall be approved by the State board 
of education. 
Centralized control and supervision over this type of training is 
further strengthened by the following provision: 
The State board of education may from time to time appoint suitable persons to 
assist in carrying out the provisions of this act and to encourage the establishment 
of such evening schools. 
State aid to local schools was authorized equal to that raised 
locally.!. This is the first instance where the necessity for special 
facilities for foreign-born residents of the State is recognized by 
statute. 
ACTS AUTHORIZING EVENING SCHOOLS. 
Other States have taken a less direct method by providing evening 
schools for native as well as foreign born persons. Statutes enabling 
local school authorities to establish and maintain such schools are | 
of two kinds: First, those permitting local officials to use their discre- 7 
tion; second, those making the establishment of evening schools in 
larger cities mandatory. In both cases the specific provisions 
generally take effect automatically upon the petition of a stipulated 
number of persons. Massachusetts, exemplifying the second type, 
was one of the first States to authorize the establishment of evening     
1 Under this statute Hoboken in 1907 received the sum of $700; in 1908 it received $500, and the city of 
Elizabeth $1,846.36; in 1909 the cities of Hoboken, Caldwell, Elizabeth, and Princeton received altogether 
$9,260; in 1910 Princeton received $50; in 1911 Caldwell and Hoboken received together $2,200; and in 1912 
Hoboken alone received $4,000.
-P-A-G-E-464
  428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
schools. In 1857 the legislature authorized what were called “adult 
schools.” In 1870 cities and towns of over 10,000 population were 
required to conduct evening classes in mechanical drawing. The 
scope of these provisions was again extended in 1883, when such 
municipalities were required to maintain night schools for persons 
over 12 years of age and to teach certain common branches. The 
claim of the foreign born to special facilities was partially recognized 
in 1898 by the addition of the subjects of English language and 
grammar to the list of required courses. 
In New York the maintenance of free night schools is optional with 
the board of education of any school district or city. In Pennsyl- 
vania evening classes are optional with the board of school directors 
in each district, except that in districts of the second, third, or fourth 
class establishment is mandatory if the parents of 25 or more pupils 
apply for such accommodation. Similar provisions for night schools 
are made by the other principal ‘‘immigration”’ States. 
CAMP SCHOOL LEGISLATION. 
Many foreign-born laborers are isolated in labor camps, where 
opportunity for acquiring English is limited. The nature of employ- 
ment on railways, highways, etc., demands the use of little English, 
because the foreman generally speaks the vernacular of his laborers. 
To provide educational facilities for labor-camp men, New York has 
made an innovation in school extension by authorizing the estab- 
lishment of camp schools. In 1912 the commissioner of labor was 
authorized to establish and supervise classes in labor camps for 
adult and minor aliens, but no funds were appropriated. To make 
this new type of school a recognized part of the educational system, 
the legislature, in 1913, amended the education law by providing for 
the creation of ‘‘temporary school districts.”” Such districts may be 
established outside of cities and union free school districts “whenever 
any considerable number of persons shall have been congregated in 
camps or other places of temporary habitation who are engaged in 
the construction of public works” under contract with the State or 
any municipality. Each district is entitled to a stipulated quota 
from the State school funds. Additional support is made a charge 
upon the particular State or municipal funds appropriated for the 
construction of the public works. Immediate supervision is vested 
in an official of the State department of education, i. e., in the super- 
intendent for the supervisory school district within which the tempo- 
rary district and camps are located. General control and supervision 
are centralized in the State commissioner of education. Following 
the example of New York, the California commission of immigration 
and housing, created in 1913, was authorized to—
-P-A-G-E-465
PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. . 429 
cooperate with proper authorities to extend this education for both children and 
adults to labor camps and other localities from which the regular schools are not easily 
accessible. 
These provisions point the way for extending the usefulness of the 
public schools, and if followed by other States will go far to facilitate 
the assimilation of the many thousands of foreign laborers employed 
in construction work. 
COMPULSORY EDUCATION OF ILLITERATES. 
In 1887 Massachusetts began an experiment in the compulsory 
education of illiterate minors. Such persons between the ages of 14 
and 21 years were required to attend some school if they were in 
continuous residence for one year in a city or town where an evening 
school is held. These early provisions prescribed, as a test of literacy 
after instruction, “the ability to read at sight and to write legibly 
simple sentences in the English language.” In 1906 this test was 
interpreted by legislation to mean— 
in the year 1906 such ability to read and write as is required for admission to the 
second grade; in the year 1907 * * * to the third grade; and in the year 1908 
and thereafter * * * to the fourth grade. 
In 1913 the test was raised to the completion of the fourth grade. 
In 1909 the labor law was amended to prohibit the employment of 
any minor within the provisions of these acts, unless he is an attend- 
ant at a public evening school. The effect of all this legislation is to 
require that every minor between the ages of 15 and 21 years, em- 
ployed or unemployed, married or single, who is unable to pass 
the requirements in reading, writing, and spelling for the comple- 
tion of the fourth grade of the public school shall be in regular 
attendance at some public evening school while in session. 
No other State has gone so far as this in attacking the evil of 
illiteracy. The significance of this legislation becomes apparent 
when taken in connection with the fact that Massachusetts, with 
an exceedingly mixed population, has a percentage of illiteracy 
among foreign-born whites lower than 15 other States, and among 
those native born of foreign or mixed parentage lower than 30 other 
States.’ 
SPECIAL JURISDICTION OVER IMMIGRANT EDUCATION. 
From time to time States have created so-called immigration 
commissions for the purpose of inducing the migration of desirable 
persons as settlers. Examination of the laws creating such com- 
missions shows that many of them were authorized to disseminate 
information with reference to the educational facilities of the respec- 
112¥, per cent, and seven-tenths of 1 per cent, respectively.  
-P-A-G-E-466
    430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
tive States, as in Kansas and Missouri, for instance; but such pro- 
visions were primarily for the object of inducing immigration. 
In 1908, however, the State of New York passed a law establishing 
a commission of immigration to inquire into the condition, welfare, 
and industrial opportunities of aliens, and its provisions included 
an inquiry into the educational facilities provided for immigrants. 
The recommendations of the commission caused the passage of a 
law in 1910 establishing a bureau of industries and immigration 
under the department of labor. This law authorized the distribu- 
tion of the names of alien children arriving within the State and 
required the commissioner of labor to cooperate with various edu- 
cational authorities— 
to devise methods for the proper instruction of adult and minor aliens in the English 
language and in respect to the duties and rights of citizenship and the fundamental 
principles of the American system of government, and otherwise to further their 
education. 
Massachusetts, in 1913, when providing for the appointment of 
a commission on immigration, required it to make a full investiga- 
tion into the educational facilities for immigrants. New Jersey, in 
1911, and Rhode Island, in 1914, also took similar steps. 
Peculiarly significant is the action of California, which, in 1913, 
in the law creating the commission of immigration and housing, pro- 
vided that— 
The commission shall cooperate with the proper authorities and organizations, 
Federal, State, county, municipal, and private, with the object in view of bringing 
to the immigrant the best opportunities for acquiring education and. citizenship. 
To that end it shall procure from, or with the consent of, the Federal authorities 
complete lists giving the names, ages, and destination within the State of all immi- 
grant children of school age and such other facts as will tend to identify them, and 
shall forthwith deliver copies of such lists to the superintendent of public instruction 
or the several boards of education and school boards in the respective localities within 
the State to which said children shall be destined, to aid in the enforcement of the 
provisions of the education law relative to the compulsory attendance at school of 
children of school age. The commission shall further cooperate with the superin- 
tendent of public instruction and with the several boards of education in the State 
to ascertain the necessity for and extent to which instruction should be imparted 
to immigrants within the State and to devise methods for the proper instruction of 
adult and minor aliens in the English language and other subjects. 
Il. SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES. 
TERMS, SESSIONS, AND CLASSES. 
The normal term during which classes in English are conducted is 
from about the first of March. In some cities the term is only 6 
or 8 weeks; in others it is as long as the day-school term. In New 
York 7 towns conduct classes for less than 40 nights; in 17, the terms 
are less than 60 nights; while the average for 31 towns and cities
-P-A-G-E-467
PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 431 
throughout the State is only 60 nights per year. The rule of the 
Rochester Board of Education is typical: 
The fall term of the evening schools shall begin on the second Monday of October, 
and continue until the Christmas recess. The winter term shall begin on the first 
Monday of the new year, and continue according to attendance. 
In New York City the evening-school season is divided into two 
terms. The first, for elementary schools, usually begins in October 
and ends about the middle of December; the second term begins ' 
early in January and continues until the total number of sessions 
equals 90. The Massachusetts immigration commission reports that of 
63 cities and towns conducting evening schools during the school year 
of 1912-13, classes are held less than 50 evenings in 28 cities, less than 
60 evenings in 15, and 60 evenings or more in 20 cities or towns. The 
term begins in October and ends in March. The law of Connecticut 
fixes the period at 75 evenings. In Pennsylvania the school law pro- 
vides that if an evening school is established it must be kept open for a 
term of not less than 4 months in each year, each of said ‘months to 
consist of 20 days. The last term of night classes in Scranton, Pa., 
commenced October 6, 1913, and closed March 12, 1914—5 months in 
all. The average length of term in New Jersey is 16 weeks. The 
term in St. Louis is 75 nights. California appears to have the longest 
night-school term. The State law requires evening schools to con- 
tinue throughout the day-school term. This amounts to practically 
9 months of instruction. 
There is similar diversity in the number of evenings per week. The 
standard is 3 evenings per week, although in certain States and cities 
instruction is given on 5 nights. For example, in New York it is 
customary to give instruction 3 evenings to classes of foreign-speaking 
people. Classes are held on alternate evenings. The usual com- 
bination is Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, although in some 
localities sessions are held on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights. 
This is the practice in Rochester and Buffalo, N. Y. New York City 
has 4 meetings a week for most evening classes, but also has a number 
of twice-a-week groups. 
In California the law allows instruction to be given on 5 nights, i. e., 
on each evening following a day session, but San Francisco, owing to a 
curtailment in expenditures on account of the earthquake of 1906, 
has been able to maintain classes only 3 nights per week. In New 
Jersey the practice is to hold classes on 4 evenings per week. The 
Pennsylvania law requires, in effect, that sessions shall be held 5 
nights per week, although the exact provision is ‘‘each of said months 
to consist of 20 days.” Philadelphia has 4 sessions for trade schools 
and 3 for elementary and high schools. Scranton conducts classes 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings. Providence, 
R.1., has 4 evenings per week for high and technical schools, and 5  
-P-A-G-E-468
    432 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
evenings for elementary and domestic science schools. St. Louis 
conducts classes 3 times a week. Denver has a unique arrangement, 
some groups coming 5 times a week, some 3, and some 2. 
Ordinarily 2 hours per evening are spent in instruction. The 
session usually extends from 7 to 9 p. m. or from 7.30 to 9.30. Some 
teachers make a practice of holding a session of about an hour and 
three-quarters and then having a half hour informal discussion, or a 
‘short period for answering questions. The matter of hours per even- 
ing usually depends upon the particular locality, the trades engaged 
in by students, the time at which they are able to finish their evening 
meals and report for study, and upon the distance from the school 
building. It has been found by experience that a session of 14 to 2 
hours is plenty long enough for foreign-speaking students, inasmuch 
as most of them are employed during the day. The length of session 
and the time of meeting must be adapted to the needs of foreign 
students, as may be seen from the following extract from the four- 
teenth annual report of the New York City superintendent of schools 
for 1911-12: “In all evening schools the session lasts 2 hours, the 
hours for beginning varying from 7.15 to 7.45 p. m., according to the 
sex of students and the local demands.’’ Chicago makes the hours 
of instruction per evening optional with the principal, although in 
most States the matter of determining the number of hours is gen- 
erally left by law to the discretion of the local board of education. 
The Rochester board fixes the hour of beginning at 7.30 p. m. and 
of closing at 9.15. Scranton at 7.30 and 9.30 p. m., dividing the 
session in two periods of 1 hour each. The school law of Pennsyl- 
vania requires a session to be at least 2 hours in length. 
IMPORTANCE OF SUMMER SESSIONS. 
There has been considerable criticism of the length of the evening- 
school term. Extending ordinarily from October until March, it 
does not reach as large a number of foreigners as could be reached by 
postponing the closing date or maintaining a summer term. Unfortu- 
nately, evening classes for adult foreigners stop at about the time the 
period of greatest immigration sets in. The months of March, April, 
and May are usually those in which the greatest number of foreigners 
come to our shores. This increased volume of immigration con- 
tinues throughout the summer until as late as September. Further- 
more, evening schools are conducted through the period of greatest 
industrial activity, and consequently many pupils are unable to 
attend who at other times would be in a position to do so. In 1910 
the education authorities for New York City, appreciating the 
importance of summer evening school instruction in English for 
foreigners, opened one in Manhattan. In 1911 two such schools
-P-A-G-E-469
  PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 433 
were maintained, and in 1912 four schools were opened, two of which 
were in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn. The innovation was 
appreciated, for the total registration rose from 2,302 the first year to 
3,933 in 1912. Philadelphia has no summer term, notwithstanding 
that it has a large immigrant population. In 1909 a joint committee 
of the civic club of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia research and 
protective association commented on this fact in the synopsis of its 
report on the educational opportunities of foreigners immigrating to 
Philadelphia in the following language: 
This committee desires to draw attention to the exceeding short term of the night 
school. It extends only from October to March, and there is no summer eee at 
which time the largest number of immigrants is arriving. 
INADEQUACY IN NUMBER OF SCHOOLS AND CLASSES. 
The number of classes provided by different cities is far from ade- 
quate. The importance of the education and assimilation of foreigners 
is seldom appreciated, and appropriations are insufficient to provide 
the requisite teaching force. In Seattle, Wash., there were 20 classes 
for adult immigrant instruction. In San Francisco in December, 
1918, there were 24 classes in 8 different schools, but in June, 1914, 
the number of classes had diminished to 12 in 7 different schools. 
The 1913 report of the St. Louis superintendent of schools shows that 
25 classes were maintained during the year. The recent report of 
the New Jersey immigration commission shows that only 20 cities in 
the State conducted one or more evening classes for foreigners, the 
the total number of classes in 1911-12 amounting to 190. Newark 
had 70 classes; Elizabeth, 15; and Jersey City, 14. The fifty-fifth 
annual report of the board of education for Rochester, N. Y., shows 
that only 7 classes were maintained. Failure to appreciate the need 
of increase in accommodations is shown by the fact that 19 cities in 
the State of New York, with a population of 10,000 to 30,000, the 
foreign-born population varying from 1,000 to 7,000, have no public 
night classes where immigrants could learn the English language. 
Only 31 cities in the State report that they maintain evening schools 
for foreigners. In Massachusetts 67 cities and towns conducted such 
classes in 1912-13; and in California 4 cities. In Oregon, only 1 city, 
Portland, has night schools for foreigners. 
TEACHERS OF FOREIGNERS. 
The qualification of teachers of adult foreigners has been the subject 
of considerable dispute chiefly because of the difference of opinion 
that exists with regard to the use of English or the foreign language . 
in instruction. It is claimed, on the one hand, that a teacher who 
uses the English language only will naturally compel the student to 
73226°—xp 1914—vor 1——28 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
  434 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
use that language, while the teacher who speaks the foreign language 
will be apt’ to use it too frequently in making explanations, and con- 
sequently pupils will fail to acquire the habit of ‘‘thinking” in the 
English language. On the other hand, there are those who contend 
that the native language must be used in the first instance as a medium 
for bringing out the idea; that a teacher who is able to use the for- 
eigner’s native tongue will be more sympathetically inclined toward 
him and will have a better understanding of his language difficulties, 
his national characteristics, customs, and experiences. 
It should be noted that few cities have ever consistently experi- 
mented with the second method, because of the difficulty of securing 
teachers who have specialized in such languages as Italian, Hungarian, 
and Polish. Thus, the San Francisco school officials make an effort 
to get teachers for the foreign classes who speak at least two languages, 
but find that it is exceedingly difficult to get such teachers with suffi- 
cient training in teaching methods. Teachers speaking languages 
other than German, French, and Italian, have proved particularly 
difficult to secure. In Seattle no effort is made to employ foreign- 
speaking teachers. In New York City the policy of employing 
foreign-born teachers has been abandoned, the school authorities 
having come to the conclusion that such teachers are not a success. 
The Massachusetts commission of immigration comments upon this 
subject as follows: 
Certainly, if teachers speaking the foreign languages are not employed, interpreters 
are needed to meet and enroil those pupils who are unable to speak any English and 
to help the regular teachers in the first few lessons. 
In Buffalo, N. Y., an advanced stand has been taken upon this 
question. The superintendent’s annual réport for the year 1911 
makes the following statement: 
To bring a better and more adult class of teachers to the difficult work of teaching the 
foreigner in the evening schools, the board, in the new syllabus, has deemed it advis- 
able to raise the requirements for entrance to the examinations in this grade. The 
minimum age limit has been fixed at 25 years, and ‘‘the candidate, besides passing 
written examinations in grammar, rhetoric, spelling, and composition, must also show 
to the satisfaction of the examiners ability to converse intelligently and fluently in 
some foreign language.’’ These requirements are expected to improve the’standard 
of teachers taking up this difficult line of work and should result in more competent 
instruction. 
One other fact is particularly noticeable with reference to the 
selection of teachers. Some school authorities apparently consider 
it important to take only day-school teachers for evening class work, 
on the ground that others would not have the necessary experience 
in the science and art of pedagogy. The essential difference between 
the methods necessary to instruction in the night school and those 
in the day school is not recognized. The Massachusetts immigration
-P-A-G-E-471
  PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 435 
commission reports that 62 out of 67 cities in the State conducting 
night schools in 1912-13 employed practically all of their night-school 
teachers from the day-school staff. The commission regards this as 
a serious handicap, commenting upon it as follows: 
In the cities and towns where classes meet four nights weekly—in one case five 
nights—it is obvious that the day-school teacher can not furnish the necessary vigor, 
enthusiasm, and special preparation; while, on the other hand, the demand that the 
evening school makes on her strength leaves her unable to do the best teaching of 
which she is capable the next day. So it is’a costly system from both standpoints. 
SPECIAL CERTIFICATES. 
Some cities and States have recognized the value of granting 
special certificates to teachers who desire to teach foreigners. Buffalo, 
N. Y., requires a special examination and gives a special certificate. 
In California the State law requires that French, German, Italian, 
and Spanish must be taught in at least one school in every city of 
the first class, and students graduating from these classes are allowed 
a special certificate to teach languages in the evening schools. In 
New Jersey the law establishing evening schools for foreign adults 
requires that every teacher employed in such a school shall hold a 
special certificate. This provision has been interpreted to mean, 
under the ruling of the State board of education, that, in order to 
obtain such a certificate, a teacher must take an examination in the 
language of the pupils to be taught. However, as the ruling worked 
hardship on many communities unable to procure teachers so quali- 
fied, a new ruling was made that after July, 1913, any regular teach- 
er’s certificate would permit the holder to instruct foreigners in even- 
ing schools, and a limited special certificate might be granted to any 
person not less than 18 years of age who could successfully pass an 
examination in English and elementary civics, relating particularly 
to common, municipal, and State regulations as to franchise, police, 
etc. This certificate was to be good for three years, at the end of 
which time it might be made permanent upon the holder passing a 
successful examination in the history of the United States. This 
ruling has considerably facilitated the employment of suitable 
teachers for foreign students. 
COMPENSATION TO TEACHERS OF FOREIGN CLASSES. 
The salary of evening-school teachers throughout the country is 
generally computed on the basis of a stipulated amount per evening 
of instruction. The amount paid varies according to the size of the 
city and the difficulty in teaching, and ranges from 75 cents to $3 
per evening. The law of Maryland, in providing for evening schools 
in Baltimore County, stipulated that the minimum salary should 
be $2.50 per evening. In Massachusetts the immigration commission  
-P-A-G-E-472
  436 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
reports that the salaries of night-school teachers range from 75 cents 
in one town of over 10,000 to $2.50 an evening. Out of 66 towns 
reporting, 25 stated the salary to be between $1.50 and $2 per evening. 
In St. Louis the evening-school instructors receive $2.75 per night. 
There instruction is given three nights per week. This would pay an 
evening-school teacher only $8.25 per week, and throughout a term 
of 75 nights only the sum of $206.25. It is customary for day-school 
teachers throughout the country to teach in the evening schools 
as a means of increasing their income. Taking advantage of this 
attitude, school boards make a nominal allowance for night instruc- 
tion, and the result has been to secure an inferior grade of teachers 
for the evening school. 
CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS. 
Immigrants in the English classes are generally classified on threo 
different bases: First, on the basis of ability to speak the English 
language; second, on the basis of nationality; third, on the basis of 
previous education in the native country. 
Relative ability to speak English is the starting point of all group- 
ing. If the pupil speaks no English, he can be put at once into the 
beginners’ class. If he speaks some English fairly well, he can be 
tried out in an intermediary class. If he speaks considerable English 
with fair fluency, and has had some instruction. in. this language, he 
belongs in an advanced class. In the larger cities attention to this 
basis of classification is quite marked. As regrouping becomes nec- 
essary after the beginning of the term, this test is most frequently 
applied. In the smaller cities, this principle is very infrequently acted 
upon; pupils of all degrees of ability to speak English are thrown 
together, usually with disastrous consequences to classes and teachers. 
Teachers find difficulty in adapting to advanced pupils subject matter 
suitable to the beginner, and the interest of both classes is eventually 
lost. 
In cities with a small number of foreigners attending night schools, 
classification on the basis of nationality is more frequent. 
In no portion of the United States, except along the western coast, 
is racial and national prejudice serious; and classification on the basis 
of nationality is for utilitarian purposes chiefly. In the western part 
of the country, however, particularly in California, Oregon, and Wash- 
ington, where there is a distinct racial prejudice against the oriental, 
orientals in both day and night schools are segregated to a considerable 
extent. In Seattle, the Japanese are grouped together if they them- 
selves desire such an arrangement. In San Francisco one class was 
conducted last year in what was called the Russian school, made 
up exclusively of Russians. Another class was made up entirely of 
French and Italian students, and a few classes almost entirely of
-P-A-G-E-473
  
PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 437 
orientals. In Merced County, Cal., there is a Scandinavian high 
school in a settlement chiefly Scandinavian. In Buffalo, N. Y., there 
are Polish evening classes for the section of East Buffalo populated 
by Poles. There are also classes containing Italians only. In Ro- 
chester one or two classes are made up exclusively of Poles in a school 
located near the Polish section, and at least two schools have classes 
of Italians exclusively. The same practice, for the sake of conveni- 
ence in teaching, is followed in New York Cit, Chicago, Philadel- 
phia, and Boston. 
Classification on the basis of previous education has never been 
followed consistently in any school. The reason for this is obvious: 
Most teachers do not speak the native language of the pupil, and are 
accordingly unable to ascertain the previous education of the pros- 
pective student. The failure to ascertain the previous education of 
a pupil leads to many unfortunate situations in the schoolroom. It 
is common to find adults who are highly educated in their native 
language grouped with pupils who have had no training whatsoever 
in any language. Teachers are obliged to spend a great deal of time 
in making explanations to the illiterate and uneducated students, 
while the more educated pupils sit in idleness. It is of course unrea- 
sonable to expect that where there is but one class in a school any 
classification on this basis or any other can be made; but in those 
schools in the larger cities where a great number of foreigners attend 
and where a great many nationalities and degrees of education are 
represented there is no reason why classification on the basis of pre- 
vious education should not be practicable. 
STANDARDIZING ATTENDANCE. 
There are many conditions affecting regularity of attendance upon 
night schools by adult immigrants. An inquiry among immigrants 
shows that the following causes discourage attendance: (1) Distance 
from the school. This is particularly true of laborers who are housed 
in labor shanties along highways, railways, etc., usually remote from 
a school building. (2) Fatigue from employment. This is probably 
the most common excuse given for not attending evening classes. 
The men are employed at heavy manual labor during the day, and 
as their minds are untrained it is a matter of considerable difficulty 
for them to devote the necessary energy to an evening school. 
(3) Ridicule. Many persons, especially adults well along in years, 
are unwilling to attend evening schools for fear of ridicule by friends 
or their own children. Adult female immigrants are particularly sus- 
ceptible to the ridicule of their children. (4) Hours of employment. 
Some men labor excessively long hours and are not in condition to 
attend evening school, while still others work in night shifts, and 
therefore find it impossible to attend because their labor begins at  
-P-A-G-E-474
  438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
about the same hour the evening classes commence. (5) Inability 
to understand the teacher. The fact that teachers do not speak the 
native language of the pupils operates, in the beginning at least, to 
keep many students away. (6) Methods of instruction. Methods of 
instruction are criticized by foreign-born students as inefficient. 
The students lose interest after the first week or two because rules of 
grammar, phonics, and monotonous exercises are forced upon them. 
They tend to become discouraged and eventually to drop out. (7) 
Inappropriate subject matter. Like the antiquated methods of instruc- 
tion, subject matter unsuited to the foreign mind and temperament 
also discourages pupils and causes them to leave the evening classes. 
Adult immigrants are not concerned with the ideas and experiences 
that interest children. Consequently lessons that do not appeal to 
their daily experience and deal with their environment, business 
and trade relationships, domestic life, etc., wholly fail to grip them. 
DEPOSITS TO SECURE REGULAR ATTENDANCE. 
To overcome these causes of nonattendance, many school authori- 
ties require a deposit to guarantee attendance, refunding the money 
at the end of the term if attendance has come up to a certain stand- 
ard. So far 17 cities have reported that they require deposits. 
Philadelphia collects 50 cents from elementary students and $1 from 
evening and trade high-school students. These amounts are refunded 
upon attendance two-thirds of the term. St. Louis requires a fee of 
$1 of all classes for a term of 20 weeks. Boston requires 50 cents of 
elementary students, excluding minors coming within the compulsory 
education law. Kansas City requires $1 for all applicants over 20 
years of age; Seattle $2 for all students; Newark $10 of elementary 
students who are nonresidents of the district and $25 of evening 
high-school students who are nonresidents. Other cities, like Detroit, 
require a deposit to cover breakage of material. Milwaukee requires 
a fee of 5 cents a week for pupils in cooking classes. Hudson, N. Y., 
requires a fee of $1, which is refunded upon an attendance of 100 
per cent. Rochester and New York City charge no fee whatever. 
In Massachusetts $1 may be charged pupils other than compulsory- 
attendance students. This is a general law applying to the whole 
State and to all classes of cities. 
ADVERTISING SCHOOL FACILITIES. 
Publicity is an important factor in acquainting foreigners with our 
public evening schools, but the right kind of publicity is seldom used. 
Some school authorities confine themselves entirely to a brief notice 
of evening classes in newspapers published in English. Only a 
limited number of foreigners are reached in this way. On the other 
hand, some schools avail themselves of the newspapers printed in 
 
-P-A-G-E-475
  
PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 439 
foreign languages circulating among the people whom it is desired 
to reach. The editors and managers of these papers cooperate with 
the schools, and are always willing to insert items, from time to time, 
regarding school advantages, particularly with reference to English 
and civics. 
Another common method of publicity is through circulars and 
posters. Frequently these are published in the English language, 
and although circulated in the foreign section, are not understood 
or widely read by the foreign-speaking people. Other school boards 
publish such circulars and posters in foreign languages, as, for example; 
in the cities of Rochester and Buffalo, N. Y., where they are dis- 
tributed through the Polish and Italian sections. As a result an 
increasing number of students are secured from year to year and the 
facilities of the night schools are more accurately understood by the 
foreign population. 
One medium of publicity is rarely ever utilized—foreigners’ or- 
ganizations. These, like the foreign-language newspapers, are nearly 
always glad to cooperate with the school authorities. It is usually 
possible to have announcements made at the weekly meetings of 
these organizations. In such a manner more definite and direct 
cooperation is secured between the schools and the foreigners them- 
selves, and a much larger number of adults become interested in 
education. 
To ascertain the general practice in the State of New York, a ques- 
tionnaire was sent to the 31 cities conducting evening schools. In 
reply, 19 reported that they availed themselves of publicity; 11 
posted notices in the English language in factories; 8 in factories, in 
the foreign tongue; 9 placed notices in English on school buildings, 
while 5 posted them in the foreign language; 18 served notice on the 
foreign population through English newspapers, and 9 through foreign- 
language papers; 13 sent notice through the children in the day 
schools; 10 cooperated with foreign churches and 13 with forcign 
societies. The cities of Schenectady and Mount Vernon reported 
that they used all the types of publicity described. Jersey City 
experiments with illustrated lectures in the foreign tongue to announce 
the classes and to attract students. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh 
utilize the American press and sometimes cooperate with foreign 
societies; they also publish circulars in the foreign tongue. Chicago 
uses these methods of publicity, but most of the western cities do not 
advertise their evening school facilities to any extent beyond news- 
paper notices, the matter of publicity not having been given any 
considerable thought. Even New York City occasionally has failed 
to make any appropriation for publicity, in which event principals 
and teachers have taken funds out of their own pockets to send ous 
postal cards and notices to prospective students. -  
-P-A-G-E-476
  440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
There is no legitimate reason why the usefulness of the evening 
schools and classes should not be extended by publicity. With the 
exception of Massachusetts, school authorities can not fall back upon 
the compulsory-education law to bring immigrants to school. The 
larger the number of students, the lower, of course, is the propor- 
tionate per capita cost for instruction. 
IV. CONTENT OF ENGLISH INSTRUCTION. 
The content of English instruction for foreigners is worthy of 
serious criticism. School authorities in general persist in adhering 
to the use of textbooks wholly unsuited to foreign-speaking students. 
Even in the same city textbooks differ in the various schools. Some 
schools use texts for adults that are in use by children in day classes; 
in others there are textbooks specially designed for foreign students 
and evening-school use. In still other schools no textbooks are used, 
the teachers having found the available textbooks unsuited to their 
students, or the school board having failed to furnish the type of text 
requested. 
So far as could be ascertained, only one or two textbooks are in 
use adapted specially to a particular nationality. Ordinarily the 
same text is used for Poles and Italians, notwithstanding the wide 
diversity in racial and national traits. Again, few texts are adapted 
to the experience of immigrants in this country. The subject matter 
chosen is usually wholly unsuited to the age, training, and attitude of 
the women and men taught. Thus one textbook devotes the first 
15 or 20 lessons to expressions familiar among children, and pictures 
meant to appeal only to a child’s mind. Further, the course in Eng- 
lish for foreigners usually fails to give sufficient emphasis to the con- 
versational side—the side the foreigner really needs. The foreigner 
learning English is little interested in such sentences as: ‘‘I have two 
ears. I hear with my two ears. I hear the sweet music with my 
ears.” On the other hand, he is interested in practical conversation 
like the following, found in one book: 
Where do you work? Iam working at the steel plant. Where is the steel plant? 
Tt is on Mill Street. How many days a week do you work? I work six days a week. 
Where do these men work? ‘They work in the steel plant. Where do they live? 
They are living on Elk Street. 
Finally, an unfortunate feature of the texts in use is the utter lack 
of any rational grouping of subjects or principle of arrangement. 
For example, in one popular textbook Lesson 1 deals with the fol- 
lowing: ‘‘Number lesson,” ‘‘New words,” ‘‘Reading and action les- 
son for two pupils,” ‘‘At the hardware store,” and ‘‘Spelling lessons.” 
Lesson 49 deals with ‘‘The cities of the United States.” Lesson 50 
has a conversation about iron ore. Lesson 51 has a reading lesson
-P-A-G-E-477
PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 441 
about fruit and vegetables. In another text, fairly good from the 
standpoint of conversation, the following lessons appear: ‘‘Lesson 
13, The seasons;” ‘‘Lesson 14, Fruits and colors;” ‘‘Lesson 15, A 
week’s work at home;” ‘‘Lesson 16, A local friend ;” ‘‘Lesson 17, The 
fire.’ These extracts are typical of practically all of the texts in 
use. It should be said that recent texts show marked tendency to 
organize and adapt subject matter more rationally to the use of for- 
eigners. 
V. METHODS OF TEACHING. 
The method of teaching English and civics to foreigners is in a 
chaotic condition. Five fairly suggestive methods of instruction 
are employed by various teachers and instructors throughout the 
country. These are the visual, dramatic, laboratory, vernacular, 
and grammatical methods. 
The visual method is employed more extensively than the others. 
It is used to some extent by practically all teachers. The teacher 
points out some convenient object in the classroom, gives its name 
to the class, and asks the individual pupil or the class as a whole to 
repeat the name after him. Many texts are so constructed as to 
bring this method into use in the first few lessons. While this 
method is frequently carried to an extreme, it is valuable in the 
teaching of the names of objects, and the expressions concerning 
them; it is practically useless, however, in dealing with expressions 
of motion and with abstract ideas. 
The so-called. “(dramatic method” of teaching English has come 
into vogue in recent years, following the widely known work of 
Gouin and more recently the efforts of Dr. Peter Roberts, of the 
Young Men’s Christian Association. Dr. Roberts has devised a 
textbook with action as the starting point. In this method the 
teacher goes through some motion or act, at the same time pro- 
nouncing the appropriate expression in English, and asking the 
pupils to repeat the expression after him, thus: “I go to the door, 
I turn the knob, I open the door.’ This method has proved to be 
of value in teaching expressions with respect to motion and action, 
but is wholly inadequate in teaching expressions regarding objects 
and abstract ideas. Pupils also make the criticism that teachers 
who employ this method habitually use too many expressions dur- 
ing the class hour, and as a consequence confuse the class. The 
chief criticism, however, is that the expressions taught in this way 
are not usually those of actual life and everyday experience, and are 
not of any particular value to the student in carrying on a conversa- 
tion. 
In a sense the laboratory method is the outgrowth of the visual 
method. It differs in taking advantage not only of the ordinary 
 
-P-A-G-E-478
442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
classroom objects, but of other objects imported into the classroom 
for more detailed conversation and discussion. The chief feature 
of the method is to take the class on an excursion into some factory, 
city department, or institution, where practical, intelligent discus- 
sion concerning the environment is carried on. A teacher in one of 
the Rochester (N. Y.) schools employs this method quite success- 
fully. He takes his class out upon the street and holds a conver- 
sation with them, teaching expressions with reference to direction, 
buildings, streets, and the local environment. He also takes his 
class to the nearest police station and fire department, where similar 
instruction is given. This is probably the closest approach to the 
ideal method of teaching English to foreigners that has yet been 
devised. 
The vernacular method brings into play the native language of 
the pupils taught, and depends for its success upon the teacher’s 
fluency and efficiency in the foreign tongue. Certain teachers in the 
San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Buffalo, and Rochester schools 
who are able to speak foreign languages make use of this method. 
The value of it lies in the ease with which rules of grammar, tech- 
nical terms, idiomatic expressions, and terms concerning abstract 
ideas can be explained to the pupils. It has been severely criticized 
by school authorities and educators on the ground that there is dan- 
ger of the teacher using too much of the native language of the pupil. 
This is perhaps true to an extent, but with the definite rule that the 
foreign language should be employed only for the purpose of mak- 
ing a necessary explanation, when it is impossible to explain the 
expression or idea in the English language, the vernacular method is 
probably the most efficient in getting the idea of the English expres- 
sion immediately into the pupil’s mind. Once this is done, it be- 
comes unnecessary to use the foreign language further, and attention 
can then be devoted to the important thing in language instruction, 
i. c., associating the idea directly and immediately with expressions 
concerning it. 
This method is appreciated by those who are not educators, as will 
be shown by the following extract from a synopsis of a report made 
in 1909 by the civic club of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia re- 
search and protective association on the educational opportunities 
of foreigners immigrating to Philadelphia. 
One evening school deserves special mention in this report * * *. The average 
attendance during the year has been 550 * * *, Twenty-six classes are in opera- 
tion, one of which is composed of women and girls. Six advanced classes are taught 
in English. ‘‘The other classes are taught partly in Italian and partly in English. 
The principal speaks many Italian dialects and teaches her teachers enough Italian 
to enable them to explain the new language in the Italian. The groundwork being 
solid, however, the progress is rapid when once pupils understand the fundamentals 
of the language.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-479
  
PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 443 
The New Jersey immigration commission, in its recent report, 
remarks that: 
Other authorities, however, believe that the teachers should have some knowledge 
of the language of the pupils in order to make clear from the first moment, the word, 
the phrase, or the idea which is presented to the pupils. 
One of the speakers at a public conference held under the auspices 
of the New York-New Jersey committee of the North American 
Civic League for Immigrants in New York City in May, 1913, referred 
to the value of this method in striking terms: 
In my experience there are two types of teachers who are successful in this field: 
First, the man or woman who speaks the language of the pupils and has had the am- 
bition and perseverance to master English to the point of being able to teach it—one 
who has gained what we may call an American point of view, and has at the same time 
asympathetic understanding of the. students in his class. Second, the American man 
or woman who has genius as a teacher, wide sympathies, few prejudices, and the gift 
of recognizing the common human elements in all peoples; who feels that the only 
barrier between himself and his pupils is that of language. 
In my opinion, as a rule, the first is the better. Between the teacher who speaks 
the native language and the pupil there is no barrier of language. It is wonderful 
how even a slight knowledge of the language helps. At only a few words of greeting, 
perhaps, eyes will light up at the effort to get nearer, and a big hole will be made 
in the wall of separation. The teacher who knows the language will have a knowledge 
of home conditions, customs, traditions, and religious observances which will enable 
him to avoid giving offense or making blunders which sometimes cause the students 
to leave. 
Many educators and instructors have the mistaken notion that 
adult immigrants can be trained in English through the medium of 
grammar, phonics, and rules. Teachers fail to appreciate that the 
average immigrant coming to this country is not only not interested 
in rules of grammar, but has not the formal grammatical knowledge 
of his own language that is a prerequisite to this kind of instruction 
in English. Frequently a grammatical rule is explained in English, 
and the pupils fail entirely to comprehend its real meaning and sig- 
nificance, and therefore become disgusted with the course of instruc- 
tion and drop out. 
Another speaker at the conference on the education of the immi- 
grant above referred to comments on this form of instruction: 
Continued drill on phonics wearies the foreigner, whose ears are not trained to the 
niceties of the English language. So we must endeavor to make our drills practical; 
always in combination with words that are vital to the community life of pupils. 
VI. PRIVATE AGENCIES AND IMMIGRANT EDUCATION. 
An increasing number of private agencies are concerning themselves 
with adult immigrant education. These agencies are National, State, 
and local in scope. Some are philanthropic, some industrial organi- 
zations; others are religious, political, patriotic, and fraternal societies 
or associations. A few of these are engaged in a social-legislative 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
  444 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
program to increase educational facilities; some are seeking to “ Ameri- 
canize”’ the immigrant; others describe their object as of a general, 
social, and educational nature. The activities in which these organi- 
zations are engaged range from classes in English for foreigners to 
district visiting and domestic training. The great majority of these 
agencies are maintained by private subscription, although some derive 
their income from the immigrant and his countrymen. A large num- 
ber are supported by industrial establishments. A few are backed 
by foreign governments. Many spring from the newer work of the 
churches. Thus a number of the large religious associations and 
missionary societies, without neglecting the field of foreign missions, 
are now devoting a great deal of time and attention to the immigrant 
problem. 
YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. 
Notable work has been done by the Young Men’s Christian Asso- 
ciation, The report of the international committee for the year 
1912-13 shows that there were organized into English classes no less 
than 21,914 immigrants, and into naturalization classes 1,693—a 
total of 23,607. More than 193,339 attended lectures during the 
year. Associations in 28 States and in 6 Provinces of Canada carried 
on 1,221 classes. Over 300 local associations are engaged in educa- 
tional work for foreigners, and 44 different nationalities were reached 
during the year in this way. The main volume of the association 
work was done in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In Massachu- 
setts and Rhode Island 45 associations were interested, having 458 
teachers, 289 classes, and 5,624 students, with a total attendance at 
lectures of 42,725. In the State of Pennsylvania 28 associations were 
working, with 190 teachers, 167 classes, 2,184 students, and 130,230 
attending lectures. In New York 33 associations were interested, 
having 130 teachers, 126 classes, and 2,148 students. In Illinois 17 
associations were engaged in the work, reaching 2,042 students; and 
in Ohio 14 associations, reaching 1,374 students. The attendance 
and classes increased during the year 34.9 per cent over the year 
preceding. 
The association first comes into contact with the immigrant at the 
principal ports of embarkation in foreign countries, where it has sec- 
retaries. These men meet and talk with the alien before he takes 
the steamer; they advise him in regard to the United States, direct- 
ing him to the Young Men’s Christian Association in the city to which 
he is destined. At the port of arrival the organization has secretaries 
who meet the immigrant, advise him as to American customs and 
conditions, and give-him general assistance. 
Following this first contact with the alien, the association endeavors 
to reach him with educational facilities. The international commit- 
tee has a department of industrial education, under the supervision
-P-A-G-E-481

PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 445 
of a secretary, who organizes the work in the various States, outlines 
courses, and correlates the educational activities of the various local 
and State organizations.t 
The annual report for the year 1912-13 shows that over 1,500 
teachers were employed in this educational work for immigrants and 
others. Most of these teachers were volunteers and came from col- 
leges, shops, offices, stores, the professions, and the trades. Appar- 
ently no uniform basis of qualification for teachers is applied, espe- 
cially when volunteer workers are taken. Fortunately, young men 
of education, usually college men, have volunteered to teach. No 
effort is made to secure instructors with ability to speak foreign lan- 
guages, since the method of teaching eliminates the foreign tongue as 
a factor in learning English. 
The method of securing students is worthy of note. Association 
secretaries are sent in search of the foreigner in boarding houses, 
saloons, candy stores, steamship-ticket agencies, private banks, 
private houses, factories, shoe-shining parlors, and societies. Many 
aliens are reached through the card of the association given by repre- 
sentatives at the ports of embarkation in Europe, and are induced 
thereby to call at the respective associations in the towns and cities 
where they locate. Advantages and opportunities for instruction 
are advertised in newspapers, in circulars in foreign languages, and 
on bulletin boards. Frequently some foreigner of more active dis- 
position is charged with the duty of working up a class among his 
friends and fellow countrymen. 
The association cooperates with churches of all denominations. It 
has cooperated with public schools in furnishing teachers; with social 
settlements, societies, and fraternities; with the Sons and Daughters 
of the American Revolution; with boards of trade, boards of health, 
associations of operators, employers of labor, and others. It has 
made surveys of communities showing local needs, and in many 
instances stimulated public-school authorities to take interest in 
immigrant education. Thus in Lackawanna, N. Y., the association 
furnishes the teachers and supervision, and the city the school build- 
ings. In small localities in the anthracite region of Pennsyvlania 
the organization furnishes teachers and also backs up the public 
schools with what are known as ‘‘miners’ institutes,’ through which 
men are prepared for the more technical training of the industrial 
schools. 
The subject matter used in the association courses in English dwells 
largely upon the everyday experiences of the immigrant, covering 
his domestic life, industrial experiences, and employment. Tach set 
of lessons is composed of several groups. These are conveniently

  446 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
arranged for use in charts and lesson leaflets. The arrangement of 
each lesson is patterned after the Gouin method. The subjects 
covered by the citizenship classes include civics, American history, 
government, industries, etc. In Chicago special lessons have been 
prepared on the eight leading city industries. In Pennsylvania, where 
classes are conducted in connection with local public-school authori- 
ties, practical talks are given on health, alcoholism, travel, labor 
unions, shops, and clubs. Where a definite course is carried out it 
generally comprehends instruction in the rights, privileges, and duties 
of citizenship; the main features of the United States Constitution, 
essential facts about the National, State, and city governments; the 
principal laws and regulations of interest to an immigrant, such as 
workmen’s compensation, compulsory education of children, etc. 
In the city of New York several meetings for different nationalities 
were held with stereopticon lectures, national songs, and speeches. 
In Pittsburgh a great singing contest was held with 1,000 present. 
Various foreign societies competed for a large silken American flag. 
In Tacoma, Wash., banquets were held for foreign men at Thanks- 
giving and Christmas, opportunity talks being given by college men 
which created great enthusiasm. Similar gatherings were held in 
San Francisco. Association men from the Massachusetts Agricultural 
College participated in Polish farmers’ days and presented problems 
in scientific agriculture. 
The Young Women’s Christian Association carries on similar work 
onasmaller scale. In New York City it conducts the International 
Institute for Young Women, located in the foreign quarter. 
CHURCH WORK AMONG IMMIGRANTS. 
Many of the denominational bodies now give special attention to 
the problem of adult immigrant education. In the Roman Catholic 
Church the subject is cared for mainly by the local parishes and 
. dioceses. Thus a church in Rochester, N. Y., recently started a 
class in English for foreigners. Sometimes a naturalization class is 
conducted, but usually aid in this direction is given personally by the 
priest in charge. The Italian and Polish Catholic Churches do much 
in immigrant education. The priest is a constant adviser in matters 
pertaining to American customs and regulations. 
The Congregational Church many years ago established a mis- 
sionary at Ellis Island, N.Y. In the year 1913 the immigrants pass- 
ing through this port into American life numbered 892,653. . The 
missionary stationed at this gateway meets the bewildered who need 
counsel, and gives directions especially concerning our public-school 
system. 
The Scandinavian Sailors’ and Immigrant Home, located in East 
Boston, Mass., takes care of about 1,500 sailors and immigrants a

  PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 447 
year. The Swedish Orphanage, at Cromwell, Conn., has 80 children 
under its protection. The Danish-Norwegian work has three homes, 
located, respectively, at Brooklyn, Boston, and Chicago. These are 
intended to help the ‘“‘newcomer” girl, by sheltering her and giving 
her first lessons in American ways. 
The Latin-American Institute, at West Tampa, Fla., exists to train 
teachers particularly for the Cubans. 
The Congregational Home Missionary Society relates itself to dif- 
ferent educational institutions that are preparing teachers to labor 
among the people of our country who still speak foreign languages. 
The educational work for foreigners by the Presbyterian Church is 
sufficiently typical of church activity in this direction to justify some 
detail. The Presbyterian board of home missions reports work carried 
onin 64immigrant communities. Bohemian, Slavic, Italian, Magyar, 
Syrian, Armenian, and Scandinavian are the principal nationalities 
dealt with. Thirty organized churches are involved and 70 workers. 
In 1913 the sum of $80,000 was appropriated. In the Presbytery of 
New York (Richmond, Manhattan, and the Bronx) there are 16 
centers, reaching Italians, Bohemians, and Hungarians principally. 
In April, 1908, a separate department to deal with immigrants in 
America was created under the board of home missions, with a super- 
intendent in charge. The headquarters are in New York City. The 
prime purpose of the department is, of course, religious, but it engages 
in investigations, the dissemination of information, instruction and 
cooperation, with the secondary purpose in mind of educating the 
immigrant. It aims to arouse a greater interest in the alien on the 
part of American churches; to suggest and outline plans for English 
classes, civic clubs, vacation schools, and industrial training. To 
insure rational treatment of local conditions, it is prepared to make 
surveys through its survey agency, and such surveys have been made 
in New York, Newark, N. J., Elizabeth, N. J., and Utica. Upon the 
basis of these investigations recommendations are made for local work. 
The missionaries or teachers who are employed are selected more 
particularly for ability in religious training, yet considerable attention 
is paid to their educational qualifications and ability to speak foreign 
languages. To facilitate the qualifications of men for this field the 
board of home missions has announced a series of immigration fellow- 
ships. These carry $1,000 each and are open to recent graduates of 
theological seminaries duly licensed or ordained by a presbytery. The 
appointees are sent to some foreign country for a period of 18 months 
or more, where they study national characteristics, needs, languages, 
ete. Each holder of such appointment contracts to serve the board 
upon his return from study for not less than three years. A number 
of such men are already in training. They are expected to do some 
educational work and supervision, in addition to ministerial duties.
-P-A-G-E-484
; 448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Other facilities for training lay-workers are provided, two of which 
are specially adapted to developing young women for immigration 
work—the Presbyterian Training School at Baltimore and the 
Missionary Trining School at Coraopolis, Pa. The latter has enrolled 
students representing Bohemian, Slovak, Ruthenian, and Italian. 
Of the numerous missions, settlements, and branches throughout 
the country conducted by churches and church societies, some con- 
duct only English classes, others engage in general educational work 
for foreigners, covering domestic science, industrial training, and 
lectures, while still others conduct-some domestic education in the 
homes or do district nursing. Practically all are supported by pri- 
vate contributions. 
EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE INDUSTRIES. 
Employers are coming to see the necessity of teaching their 
foreign-born employees the English language and something of the 
rules of safety. Experience shows that a large proportion of indus- 
trial accidents are due to foreigners not understanding the orders of 
the boss or foreman. Furthermore, a canvass of many employers of 
foreign-born workingmen indicates that a knowledge of English is 
urgently needed for the employment. This is particularly true of 
railroads, steel plants, and foundries. The latter group of industries 
has made a special effort for adult immigrant education in the 
English language, and in some instances the movement has devel- 
oped into a broadly organized system of education. Two typical 
cases are selected—the Casino Technical Night School, East Pitts- 
burgh, Pa., and the school maintained by D. E. Sicher & Co., of 
New York City. 
I. CASINO TECHNICAL NIGHT SCHOOL. 
A number of industrial corporations in the vicinity of Pittsburgh organized an 
industrial training school for their foreign-born employees. A staff of paid expert 
instructors was put in charge. The school is carried on through the cooperation of 
the Turtle Creek school board, which has rented a public-school building to the 
Management on the basis of $3 per month for each room. Only 25 per cent of the 
pupils are residents of the Turtle Creek district, the others coming from the districts 
in the vicinity. The training is open not only to employees of the companies sup- 
porting the undertaking, but also to those of other plants. In 1904 the enrollment 
was only 100; last year it was almost 700. There are over 40 teachers in the faculty, 
and the expense budget exceeds $15,000. A tuition of $25 is charged, making it about 
one-half self-supporting. The local industries contribute an annual amount of about 
$6,000 to $7,000. 
The school year is nine months, i. e., from about September 1 to June 1. A two- 
year preparatory course and a four-year course in the fundamental principles of 
engineering are given. Regular classes meet Monday, Wednesday, and Friday eve- 
nings of each week. Each evening is divided into three periods, the first beginning 
at 6.15 p. m., and the last ending at 9.15 p.m. The term is divided into two semesters 
of 19 weeks each. New students may enter at the beginning of each term. The
-P-A-G-E-485
  PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 449 
teachers are selected with a view to their ability, not only as specialists, but as to 
active participation in practical work, broad training, and wide experience. 
Students are classified by personal interview and by examination at the opening of 
each term. All new students are put on probation for the first four weeks. 
Upon the opening of the school it was found that many of the foreign applicants 
wishing to take industrial or technical training had an inadequate command of English. 
Many also needed preparatory work in the common branches. To provide this pre- 
liminary instruction, courses in English, spelling, reading, writing, grammar, and 
arithmetic were developed, with emphasis on shop terms in use in the various trades, 
The school gives training in electricity, engineering, mechanical drawing, shop 
practice, wood turning, foundry work, etc. Little attention is paid to citizenship, 
except as an incident to English training. A course in household arts for women 
reaches a number of foreign girls. 
2. D. E. SICHER & CO., NEW YORK CITY. 
The firm of D. E. Sicher & Co., a muslin-goods plant. of New York City, employs a 
large number of foreign-speaking employees, many of whom are illiterate. A cooper- 
ative scheme was worked out whereby the company furnished a classroom and partly 
financed the plan, while the New York City Board of Education furnished teacher, 
supplies, and general educational supervision. Officially the experiment was put 
on record as a part of Public School No. 4, thus eliminating the need of red tape in its 
establishment and maintenance. The purpose of the school was not so much to teach 
English as to give a very simple form of industrial training, to which learning English 
wasanincident. Theclass was made up of factory employees. Forty girls graduated 
at the end of the term, representing a variety of immigrant nationalities. Training 
was given in dressmaking, arithmetic, reading, writing, spelling, English letter writing, 
etc. There was a drawing class, stereopticon lectures, music, and a traveling library. 
Effort was made to teach the girls how to care for their health and person, how to use 
the telephone book, and other matters tending to promote their welfare and efficiency. 
At the end of the course a “‘certificate of literacy” was given each graduate by the 
board of education. 
The Pennsylvania Railroad Co. publishes several pamphlets in- 
structing employees. One deals with resuscitation from electric 
shock; another is a set of lessons in Italian and English dealing with 
the tools used in track construction. The Delaware, Lackawanna & 
Western Railroad Co. also has published lesson sets for its foreign 
employees and has cooperated with the Young Men’s Christian Asso- 
ciation in conducting classes. The Southern Pacific issues instruction 
books in Japanese. The Joseph & Feiss Co., a clothing firm of Cleve- 
land, Ohio, instructs 200 foreign employees in practical English. The 
Standard Oil ©o. and General Chemical Co., of Bayonne, N. J., are 
planning to cooperate with the local board of education in teaching 
English to 900 employees who are unable to use the language. The 
company officials propose to allow the men time off on pay during 
the day—amounting to four hours per week—until they acquire a 
vocabulary of 600 words, believing better results can be accomplished 
this way than if the men study at night. The companies will provide 
classrooms, heat, and necessary equipment, and the school board will

    450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
provide teachers. Instruction will be similar to that of the regular 
evening schools. The Witherbee-Sherman Co., of Mineville, N. Y., 
employs a domestic educator-nurse who attends sick and injured 
employees, gives the mother and children training in sanitation, 
personal cleanliness, care of health, cooking, sewing, etc. At Ells- 
worth Pa., the Ellsworth Collieries Co., through its sociological depart- 
ment, is giving instruction to its alien employees in “first aid to the 
injured,” rescue methods, etc. 
PATRIOTIC ORGANIZATIONS. 
Patriotic organizations have found a special field of opportunity 
in the education of immigrants for American citizenship. A con- 
spicuous example is the society of Sons of the American Revolution. 
At the national congress of the society at Denver in 1907 a committee 
on aliens was created and one-half the income of the society set 
aside to carry on the committee’s work. The plan adopted limited 
activity to the publication and dissemination of information regard- 
ing citizenship, its rights and duties; the Government of the Nation 
“and States; and general facts of interest and value to foreigners. 
The committee publishes a leaflet in English entitled, “Information 
for Immigrants concerning the United States—Opportunities, Gov- 
ernment, and Institutions.” This has been translated into the Italian, 
Yiddish, Polish, Magyar, Slav, Slovenian, Croatian, Swedish, Greek, 
Bohemian, German, Norwegian, Danish, and Lithuanian languages. 
Thousands are distributed by State societies and chapters throughout 
the country among manufactories, mining camps, employers of 
labor, settlement workers, social workers, patriotic societies, and 
night schools. The society has frequently cooperated with public- 
school authorities in furnishing speakers on citizenship, and aiding 
foreigners in obtaining first and second papers. . 
Vif. SPECIAL ORGANIZATIONS. 
THE NORTH AMERICAN CIVIC LEAGUE FOR IMMIGRANTS. 
The Massachusetts committee of the North American League for 
Immigrants deals with the education problem by direct contact with 
the immigrant, in cooperation with other agencies. The New York- 
New Jersey committee deals with it indirectly by investigation and 
promotion of legislative reforms and amendments. The organization 
is national in scope and has branch committees in the principal 
eastern cities. Its aim is the civic betterment of the immigrant. The 
Massachusetts committee has an extensive scheme of educational 
work. Its agents mect immigrants at the docks and stations and 
furnish advice and information about America. It also publishes
-P-A-G-E-487
PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 451 
pamphlets of advice for distribution among the newly arrived. The 
most noteworthy of these is entitled “Messages to New Comers,” 
printed in English and other languages. These are distributed among 
libraries, schools, and individuals; 60 city libraries use them. The 
subject matter of these pamphlets covers such themes as ‘‘The United 
States—Its People and Its Laws,” ‘The Need of Learning English,” 
“The Story of the American People,” ‘Naturalization,’ etc. In 
Boston alone 140 lectures in these subjects were delivered in 1912-13. 
Nearly all the branches of the North American League have infor- 
mation bureaus, where aid and advice are given. One of the most 
important of these is the Immigrant Guide and Transfer Co., main- 
tained at Ellis Island, N. Y., by the New York-New Jersey committee. 
This company has a staff of guides speaking a great variety of the 
immigrant languages.   
BARON DE HIRSCH FUND. 
This fund was established in 1891 for the benefit of Russians, 
Roumanian, and Galician immigrants. Its purpose is to teach the 
immigrant to become a good American citizen. Day and night 
schools are conducted in New York and other cities. Two special 
schools are also maintained: The Baron de Hirsch Trade School and 
an agricultural school at Woodbine, N. J. The fund has subsidized 
special classes for immigrants, day and night, at the Educational 
Alliance in New York City. Similar classes are subsidized in Boston, 
Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, 
and Cleveland. 
EDUCATIONAL ALLIANCE. 
The Educational Alliance was incorporated in 1889 and reorganized 
in 1893. It maintains a building and two branches in sections of New 
York City where the jmmigrant population is large. The purpose set 
forth is “to provide opportunities for the thousands of immigrants 
who come to the American shores, so that they may be able to adapt 
themselves to the new conditions and that they may readily assimi- 
late American ideas and ideals.’’ This object is carried out through 
day classes in English for adults, a school of domestic art and domestic 
science, civil-service classes, naturalization classes, manual-training 
classes, etc. In one branch is maintained what is called a “ Bread- 
winner’s College.’’ Lectures are given in English and Yiddish on 
American history and civics, naturalization, and other subjects of 
importance in the education of the immigrant. The alliance has 
cooperated extensively with other organizations and schools in 
building up educational work. With the Baron de Hirsch fund, it 
has carried on special day and night classes adapted to immigrants. 
 
-P-A-G-E-488
    452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
A few brief references to a number of other organizations of this 
type will show the character of work done and the need of correlation. 
The People’s University Extension Society of New York, incorporated 
in 1898, maintains free classes in domestic training and other practi- 
cal subjects. It furnishes trained teachers in civics, history, and 
other subjects to various organizations. In one year over 220,000 
persons attended its free classes. More than 85,000 attended lec- 
tures on the care of children. It has aided more than 1,000 societies 
with free classes and distributed over 425,000 pamphlets of advice 
to 500 societies in New York City. These pamphlets were published 
in Hebrew, German, Italian, Bohemian, and English. 
The Lennox Hill Settlement was founded in 1894 by the Associate 
Alumne of Normal College. The settlement house is in a crowded 
tenement section of New York City. It conducts about 30 clubs 
and classes, a bureau of advice for foreigners, and neighborhood 
work. The nationality dealt with is principally Bohemian. The 
actual work is carried on by resident and volunteer workers ana 
teachers. 
In Rochester, N. Y., a housekeeping center is maintained in the 
Italian quarter, where classes for men and women, district nursing 
and home education, and a library are conducted. In Chicago is 
Hull House, with its many ramifications. In Boston is the Civic 
Service House, working out a new idea in community civic training. 
There is urgent need for closer cooperation among the many 
philanthropic organizations now working independently on the 
problem of educating the immigrant. 
ORGANIZATIONS AMONG FOREIGNERS. 
A number of organizations composed mainly of foreigners are doing 
important work in the field of immigrant education. One of the 
most important of these is the Society for Italian Immigrants. This 
society has been in existence over 11 years. Its fundamental purpose 
is to assist and advise Italian immigrants in the United States. It 
has both Italians and Americans on its membership, and it is sup- 
ported partly by contribution from the Italian Government. This 
society maintains a night school in the construction camp at the 
Ashokan Dam, N. Y., where there are many Italian laborers. Thirty 
or forty men from the camp attend classes in English and citizenship 
5 nights each week for 12 months. There are two classes, one for 
advanced pupils and one for beginners. English, reading, writing, 
some arithmetic and geography, and something of American laws 
and customs are the subjects dealt with. Two teachers, one a 
woman experienced in teaching English and the other a young man 
of Italian parentage, compose the staff. Both act as advisers and 
dispense general information. An experimental school was also
-P-A-G-E-489
  
PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 453 
carried on for five months in the Berkshire Mountains, where several 
hundred Italians were engaged in building a trolley. The company 
and citizens contributed toward equipment and maintenance. Much 
general information is disseminated by the society through its agents 
in charge of the “home” for Italian immigrants in New York City. 
Many thousands take advantage of this home annually; many are 
also advised by guides at the docks and ferries. 
The Armenian Colonial Association was incorporated in 1893 to 
provide an educational and industrial institution for Syrian and 
Arabic speaking immigrants. The Italian-American Civic League, of 
New York, announces its purpose as that of civic education and nat- 
uralization of Italians in New York. It maintains 10 civic clubs, 
classes for civic instruction in various sections of the city, and 
branches of the naturalization bureau. The Hebrew Education 
Society, of Philadelphia, has a lecture hall and library and gives 
instruction in English, civics, telegraphy, typewriting, cigar making, 
dressmaking, etc. Another society in Philadelphia conducts classes 
in English and engages in various social activities. A German society 
has a library and night school, teaches German and English, American 
history, constitution, institutions, ethics, ete. A Polish society in the 
same city prepares young men for college, gives a two-year course, 
and has night classes in English, mechanical drawing, ete. At Cam- 
bridge Springs, Pa., is a Polish university maintained by the Polish 
National Alliance. 
These are but a few of the many organizations engaged in some 
phase of educational work that are maintained by foreigners them- 
selves. Results have not always been satisfactory; sometimes 
Americanization is retarded rather than accelerated by their activi- 
ties. They are, nevertheless, an important element to be considered 
in any plans for treating adult immigrant education. 
VII. ADULT IMMIGRANT EDUCATION IN CANADA. 
Canada affords a valuable instance of work of private organiza- 
tions for foreigners. The Reading Camp Association, which has for 
its patron the Duke’of Connaught and for its president a lumberman 
of Ontario, aims to educate the foreigner in the great labor camps 
‘along the railway lines and in the lumber regions. Schools have been 
established in 36 different camps along the frontier of Canada and in 
remote regions. The association has a force of about 40 secretaries 
and instructors, many of whom are employed in the camps in which 
they teach. The following extract from the annual report indicates 
the character of the work accomplished: 
For two successive winters we operated night schools at two camps 40 miles from 
Lorring, in the district of Parry Sound. Among the 130 men there were about 20  
-P-A-G-E-490
  454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
fellows who became deeply interested in their studies and were doing what little they 
could on matriculation subjects. Most of these boys spent their summers on the farms 
about 10 miles from the camps. In order to induce them to keep up their studies and 
so become camp instructors themselves, we sent J. J. Pearson, P. A., a graduate of 
Victoria College, to conduct evening classes and to teach them in their homes when 
he could notinduce them toattend nightschool. Theresult wasencouraging. * * * 
As it is, the immigrants who are located on our woodland frontier soon become dis- 
couraged on their schoolless, doctorless, roadless, undeveloped homesteads and leave 
the farms to swell our city slums.

  CHAPTER XXI. 
RECENT PROGRESS IN WIDER USE OF SCHOOL PLANT. 
By Crarence Artaur Perry, 
Associate Director, Department of Recreation, Russell Sage Foundation. 
ContTEeNTs.—Sources of information—Increase of miscellaneous occasions—Use for political purposes— 
Liberal letting regulations—W ider use with the aid of voluntary societies—Social and recreation cen- 
ters—Adult education through lectures—Evening schools being socialized—Library extension through 
school branches—The high school as an art center—Extension of day activities—Adapting school 
buildings for community use—School extension in rural districts—W ider-use legislation. 
This chapter is based largely upon information received in response 
to a general request sent out by the Commissioner of Education 
November 29, 1913. The scope of this appeal was given as ‘‘ what 
has come to be called ‘the wider use of the school plant,’ the use of 
schoolhouses, grounds, and equipment for other purposes than the 
instruction of children during school hours,” and it brought in a 
large amount of typewritten and printed material from school 
authorities throughout the United States. 
The statistics concerning the extent of social centers were obtained 
through an investigation covering the months of February, March, and 
April, 1914, in which school officials recorded upon blank forms 
furnished by the Bureau of Education the evening occasions in the 
buildings under their charge.1 There were also available, as supple- 
mentary aids, the informational resources of the department of 
recreation of the Russell Sage Foundation. 
The movement to use the school premises for larger portions of the 
total utilizable period is advancing with such rapidity and showing 
such variety of aspects that a complete description of its present 
status is out of the question; only a summary of its newer features 
will therefore be attempted. 
INCREASE OF MISCELLANEOUS OCCASIONS. 
In the vast number of letters received from superintendents there 
is scarcely a dissent from the view that a wider use of the school 
buildings and grounds has come to be accepted as desirable. The 
most convincing evidence of this attitude is seen in the number and 
character of the occasions which call for the use of the school halls in 
  
1 The complete resuilts of this inquiry are to appear in bulletin form. 
455 
   
-P-A-G-E-492
  456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
the after-study nours of the day. In general this condition has come 
about through greater hospitality toward outside organizations. 
The largest class of bodies seeking such use of school halls is composed 
of the mothers’ clubs, patrons’ societies, and other forms of parent- 
teacher associations. Next in importance are the various taxpayers’, 
ward, and town improvement associations. These groups naturally 
resort to the schoolhouse as the most convenient meeting place in 
the neighborhood. Allied with them are the women’s civie clubs, 
housewives’ leagues, and similar associations with civic and cultural 
objects. 
Another large group of organizations meeting in the school build- 
ings is made up of those engaged in some form of musical endeavor. 
These include bands, amateur orchestras, and choral and oratorio 
societies. To the school building have also come art clubs, natural 
history societies, Chautauqua circles, county historical societies, the 
Daughters of the American Revolution, and similar groups inter- 
ested in self-improvement. Still another large class is composed, 
very appropriately, of Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, junior chambers 
of commerce, and other bodies of young people with analogous aims. 
In the rural districts the farmers’ institutes and the grange meet- 
ings are frequently held in the schoolhouse. 
The amount of use by sectarian and religious organizations is some- 
what surprising. The reports show that, in various parts of the 
country, schoolrooms are used by Sunday schools and missionary 
societies, as well as for divine worship. Denominational athletic 
associations, church societies, Sunday-school teachers’ training classes, 
and Young Men’s and Young Women’s Christian Associations indi- 
cate other phases of religious activities which are found upon public- 
school premises. One city reported that the Jews and one or two 
other sects were using the schoolhouses after 4 o’clock for sectarian 
instruction. 
This is only a partial list of organizations that are meeting on 
school premises, but it indicates their general character. The liberal 
attitude observed by some school authorities toward requests from 
outside bodies is illustrated by an instance coming from a State in 
which school buildings can not legally be used for other than educa- 
tional purposes without specific permission being granted at a town 
meeting. A superintendent in this State says that “the policy of our 
committee is, however, to allow the school plant to be used as freely 
as possible until objection shall be made.” Such is also the practice 
in many other sections. 
USE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. 
“Two of our primary schools were used as voting places with entire 
success” —in these words a New Jersey superintendent relates the 
conclusion of a growing number of school officials relative to the feasi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-493
  
PROGRESS IN WIDER USE OF SCHOOL PLANT. 457 
bility of using school buildings for political purposes. In Worcester, 
Boston, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, and a number of other cities the 
schoolhouses have for years been used as polling places during elec- 
tions. Within the past year the same privilege has been granted in 
many other cities, in some to a notable extent. In Chicago during 
the spring elections of 1914, according to the report of the business 
manager of the board of education— 
75 school buildings were used as polling places, and in only 6 of that number wero 
violations of the rules reported by the school officials, the nature of the complaints 
being smoking, in a few instances, and tobacco chewing. No quarrel arose, nor was 
there any ungentlemanly conduct on the part of the male voters in the presence of 
the women or otherwise. 
In Boston voting has been carried on in basements of public-school 
buildings for a number of years, and a special equipment for this pur- 
pose has been devised, which is stored away when not in use. In 
Seattle, Wash., all the school buildings erected during the past three 
or four years have been provided with special rooms in the basement, 
having direct outside entrance for use during elections and for other 
public purposes. In many cities the primaries as well as the regular 
elections are held on school premises. 
There has also been an extension of the use of school buildings for 
political rallies. In Chicago during the election referred to above, 
142 school buildings were rented for political meetings. The business 
manager writes that— 
In no instance was it necessary for the board to forfeit any portion of the required 
deposit of $25 on each school because of damage or any infraction of the rules of the 
board. * * * No smoking or other tobacco indulgences were permitted, and no 
indications of disorder were apparent after the audience had left the premises on all 
occasions, 
The significance of this report is further increased by the fact that 
four-fifths of the meetings were held under partisan auspices. At 
the others all of the candidates were invited to be present at one time, 
and the meeting was held under the auspices of the local civic asso- 
ciation. ; 
The superintendent of Holyoke, Mass., writes as follows: 
The use of a school hall for a political rally is on the whole a good thing. We have 
been able to remove many of the objectionable features of political rallies by instruct- 
ing the janitors as to the way in which they must force the attendants at those rallies 
to conduct themselves. 
In certain cities the privileges of schoolrooms are given to political 
organizations of every type, upon request, but in many other places 
partisan use is forbidden. The growth of direct legislation has in 
some places given definiteness to the school board’s policy regarding 
political use. For example, in Winston-Salem, N. C.: 
When the question of commission form of government for the city of Winston was 
a live question with us, the school buildings throughout the city were used by the
-P-A-G-E-494
      458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
people as assembly places for the discussion of this matter. Recently, when the 
question of consolidating the city of Winston and the city of Salem into the city of 
Winston-Salem was a matter of great concern to all of our people, the schoolhouses 
were used as places of discussion and debating. Our buildings are never used for 
partisan purposes, but wherever the question concerns all of our people, whether it 
be political, social, or what not, we not only allow the use of the school buildings, but 
we encourage their use and insist wpon the people coming to the school buildings 
which belong to them. 
Previous to voting upon a municipal referendum in Springfield, 
Til., the superintendent of schools himself presided at a number of 
neighborhood meetings for the discussion of the question at issue. 
By insisting upon equal time limits for the two parties to the dis- 
cussion, an unusually ardent campaign was carried through without 
arousing public criticism. 
From Chelsea, Mass., the superintendent writes: 
In our city our school halls are used for municipal campaigns. The city charter 
reads that the city must provide halls for municipal candidates. 
LIBERAL LETTING REGULATIONS. 
The large number of miscellaneous occasions in school buildings 
is to be accounted for by the more generous terms under which out- 
side organizations are being allowed the use of school privileges. 
The cities in which parent-teacher organizations are admitted to 
school buildings without expense for heat, light, or janitor service 
have always been numerous; now this privilege is extended to other 
organizations. In Springfield, Tll., neighborhood clubs and improve- 
ment associations are also allowed the free use of schoolrooms. In 
Cleveland, Ohio, neighborhood clubs may have the use of auditoriums 
or gymnasiums upon the payment of a small fee to the custodian. 
During the 1913-14 school year, 298 organizations used 74 Cleveland 
schoolhouses a total of 1,932 times, at an expense for custodians’ 
fees of $1,729.91. The total attendance upon these meetings was 
120,511, a very considerable benefit at a slight.expense. 
In Rochester, N. Y., nonexclusive organizations of adults, whose 
object is approved by the board of education, may have the use of 
public school buildings without charge if there are other activities 
going on at the same time in the building. A civic club which meets 
when no other group is present in the building is charged a small fee 
for heat, light, and janitor service. Upon the application of 50 
adult citizens, boys’ and girls’ clubs may be allowed to meet in school 
buildings and have also the services of a responsible director, This 
privilege is withdrawn, however, if the average attendance falls 
below 25 during any two consecutive months. Whenever the clubs 
meeting in the school building have an aggregate average attendance 
of at least 50, a library and reading room and the services of a librarian 
are provided. If the average weekly attendance at the clubs during
-P-A-G-E-495
      
PROGRESS IN WIDER USE OF SCHOOL PLANT. 459 
a month aggregates 100, general lectures are introduced or permitted. 
These general neighborhood meetings are discontinued if the attend- 
ance during two consecutive months falls below the prescribed mark, 
The board of school commissioners in Baltimore, Md., has a rule 
that ‘‘the assembly room or other suitable rooms of school build- 
ings may be used by responsible civic and improvement associations 
for the discussion of questions of a public, civic, and educational, but 
not of a partisan or religious, nature,” with no expense except for 
janitor’s services, provided certain minor formalities are observed. 
The following instances illustrate the important civic service the 
board is in this way rendering the community: 
Permission has been granted to the South Baltimore Business Men’s Association to 
hold their meetings at School No. 70. 
The Business Science Club of Walbrook meets at School No. 63 to discuss civic and 
social problems. 
The Maryland Bureau of Statistics and Information has been granted the use of 
various buildings, located in different parts of the city, to investigate the status of 
boys applying for newsboys’ badges. 
The Home Garden committee has been similarly granted the use of rooms in several 
buildings throughout the city for their meetings. 
The Easterwood Neighborhood Association has its monthly meetings at School No. 
62 for the discussion of neighborhood and other civic matters. 
The use of desired rooms in School No. 61 has been granted to the Cooperative Club 
for purposes largely similar to the last-mentioned association. 
The Park Approach Protective Association also has the use of rooms in School No. 
61, in which they hold their monthly meetings for the discussion of civic and social 
matters. 
The request of the Women’s Civic League for the use of Schools 47, 59, and 79 has 
been granted, giving them the right to hold their district meetings in these schools 
and to use them as district centers for the purpose of organizing the work of improve- 
ment of the school grounds and neighboring surroundings. 
The 1914 budget of the New York City Board of Education in- 
cludes a sum of $5,000 to be used in the payment of janitorial charges 
incurred in connection with the use of certain specified school build+ 
ings by voluntary organizations that are maintaining social center 
activities. 
In accordance with the recent California enactment establishing 
civic centers in the public schoolhouses, the cities of that State are 
allowing the use of school accommodations to large numbers of local 
organizations. In Oakland 18 schools are used by 43 organizations. 
Their character is indicated by some of their names: Mothers’ Club, 
Exposition Band, Durant Improvement Club, Public Welfare League, 
St. Aloysius Solidarity of St. Elizabeth’s Church, Women’s Socialist 
League, Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the Young Women’s 
Christian Association, and the Junior Literary and Social Club. 
These are but a few of the instances of enlarged service communities 
are receiving from school properties. 
 
-P-A-G-E-496
460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
WIDER USE WITH THE AID OF VOLUNTARY SOCIETIES. 
The meetings of the outside organizations that are greatly increas- 
ing the miscellaneous afterclass occasions in school buildings are 
mainly for the benefit of their own members and friends. Many of 
these bodies also cooperate with the school authorities in the main- 
tenance of regularly occurring activities for the enjoyment of persons 
not included in their own membership. This form of cooperation 
shows a steady growth. It is important not only because of the ex- 
tension in the use of school facilities it accomplishes, but also because 
it generally leads to the assumption of the wider-use activities by the 
school authorities themselves, and thus promotes a closer relation- 
ship between them and the public. 
This cooperation may originate either with the school officials or 
with the volunteer group. Here are instances of both origins. A 
supervising principal in New Jersey writes: 
About that time the teachers and myself began to agitate the subject of opening the 
school and formed a club called the Social Center Club. We then put the matter 
squarely before the board of education, and as a result we have now many lectures, 
various entertainments, informal dances—more especially for young people—tea 
F parties, etc. 
The following not only illustrates the origination of an activity by 
an outside group, but suggests a novel solution of one of the problems 
in domestic service: 
All the schools of the district are open to any proper form of neighborhood activity 
that develops. The board of education does not initiate very much of the work but 
isalwaysina sympathetic mood. Asit is now, seven of our nine buildings have some- 
thing going on one, two, or three nights a week. One new departure has just started, 
and that is the opening of one of our assembly halls for maids for Sunday afternoon 
from 4 to 7, where they meet their friends, visit, have their gentlemen friends call 
upon them, get a cup of tea or coffee, etc., and have a social time. No sports or games 
are allowed on such an occasion. This was begun last Sunday for the first time, and 
some 10 maids were there. It seemed to start out propitiously, but what its future 
may be remains to be discovered. 
As illustrative of the various forms which this cooperation takes, 
a number of examples may be given. The instances where a woman’s 
| club has the use of a school building for giving evening instruction 
to a class of mothers, or where a boys’ club is supported and directed 
by the Daughters of the American Revolution, indicate this type 
of enterprise in its simplest form. A more comprehensive scheme is 
found in Elmira, N. Y., where a committee, representing the Federa- 
tion for Social Service, worked with the board of education in the 
organization of neighborhood associations at three of the public 
schools. Under the auspices of these local groups a series of meetings 
were held at which there were discussions of such subjects as tuber- 
culosis, sex hygiene, bird life, and European travel, interspersed with  
-P-A-G-E-497
  
PROGRESS IN WIDER USE OF SCHOOL PLANT, 461 
musical numbers and recitations, and followed with refreshments and 
conversation. 
In South Bend, Ind., a committee of the chamber of commerce 
has been instrumental in arranging a series of ‘‘civic center meetings” 
held every two weeks in a number of the public schools. The school 
board furnished not only heat, light, and janitor service, but also a 
motion-picture machine. An extensive program of concerts, read- 
ings, and lectures are held in the Montclair (N. J.) schools under the 
combined auspices of the local women’s organizations, the board of 
education, and Unity Church. Plainfield, N. J., offers several sug- 
gestive forms of cooperation: 
Three of the school yards, with the adjoining buildings, are used for playground 
purposes under the control of the city playground commission, with the cordial coop- 
eration of the board of education. Various buildings are used for social center pur- 
poses under the general direction of a citizens’ committee on evening recreation. 
This committee was organized at the suggestion of the board of education and has in 
its membership the president of the board and the superintendent of schools. It 
employs a supervisor under a salary, who devotes her whole time to conducting and 
promoting the work. The board of education furnishes the buildings with heat, light, 
and janitor service and pays a portion of the salary of the supervisor. The work 
includes evening meetings of various kinds, for dancing, club purposes, instruction, 
municipal orchestra, etc. * * * Library centers in several of the school build- 
ings are open on various evenings to give the library benefits to the people of the 
neighborhood. 
The town improvement association of Bloomfield, N. J., main- 
tains classes in sewing, folk dancing, and athletic games one night a 
week in two grammar schools. The Washington Irving High School, 
in New York City, is the headquarters for the Gramercy Neighbor- 
hood Association. This body conducts weekly dances on the roof 
or in the gymnasium of the high school, arranges orchestral concerts, 
programs of motion ‘pictures, and cooperates in securing loan art 
exhibits for the foyer of the building. It has been allotted office 
space in the high school and is doing much to improve social condi- 
tions in that part of the city. 
In Jersey City a volunteer extension committee of 20 or 30 members 
cooperates with the board of education in the maintenance and direc- 
tion of public dances and club work for young women and men. Em- 
broidery, folk dancing, and choral work are included in their activities. 
In the same city a public forum is held in one of the large high schools 
on Sunday afternoons by the People’s Institute. At these meetings 
topics of a civic, social, or ethical character are presented by well- 
known speakers. While the instances just recorded happen to be 
drawn from eastern localities, they nevertheless illustrate forms of 
cooperation that are to be found in all parts of the country. 
 
-P-A-G-E-498
  462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
SOCIAL AND RECREATION CENTERS. 
The recent tendency to use public school buildings during the 
evenings in organized social and recreational activities can not be 
measured in accurate quantitative terms. The difficulty is that there 
is no agreement as to what constitutes a social center. According to 
current usage ‘‘social center’’ is applied to a wide range of undertak- 
ings; similar sets of activities have different names in different places. 
“Kivening center,’ ‘‘school center,’ ‘‘community center,’ and 
“civic center’ have all been applied to evening enterprises that in 
some cities go by the name of social or recreation centers. The diffi- 
culty is further complicated by the lack of uniformity in record 
keeping and the absolute lack of information in many school board 
offices as to the precise number of evening occasions that called for the 
use of their school edifices. 
An attempt was made during the months of February, March, and 
April, 1914, to obtain uniform records of evening occasions in cities 
of 5,000 population and over. To all superintendents who offered 
to cooperate, blank forms were furnished with spaces for a daily 
record of evening activities. Of the 233 cities that accepted this 
offer, filled-out cards were returned by 110. In tabulating these 
cards, those which showed evening occasions other than those of the 
regular night school as frequently as at least twice a week were 
assembled in one table. In this way a tentative selection of those 
cities that might be considered to have social centers was made. 
Whether or not a school having evening activities open to the public 
as frequently as twice a week represents the minimum standard for a 
social center can only be decided by the judgment of time. It 
seemed, however, the most significant standard that could be adopted 
for the present. 
The table thus prepared shows that 53 cities, having an aggregate 
of 296 schools, meet the requirements of the standard. According to 
trustworthy reports there are also 29 other cities that claim to have 
social centers, but regarding which detailed information is not at hand. 
Such reports as are available indicate that in these 29 cities there are 
about 100 schools that are locally known as social centers, and there 
is strong evidence that they are enjoying a normally rapid growth. 
Some of the more significant recent developments in cities where 
social center work has become a definite part of the school program 
may be briefly noted. 
In New York City experimenting in social center methods has been 
carried on by volunteer committees in cooperation with the board of 
education. As a result of these efforts, several expert social workers 
were added to the regular evening recreation center staff and the scope 
of their work in several neighborhoods was extended. Centers that
-P-A-G-E-499
PROGRESS IN WIDER USE OF SCHOOL PLANT. 463 
had been maintained for women and girls only were reorganized so 
as to admit men and boys. Social dancing and motion-picture enter- 
tainments with paid admissions were found to afford an income as 
well as desirable forms of amusement. Struggling amateur orches- 
tras were put on a flourishing basis through the opportunity to 
rehearse in the school building, and public forums were instituted- 
where political rallies, meetings of labor unions, and warm discussions 
of live local questions could freely take place. 
Perhaps the most important result obtained at these experimental 
social centers was the development of local committees with the 
ability to help to sustain and direct the work. In one or two of the 
centers the growth of income-producing activities was such as to supply 
funds for all of the expenses of the extra activities except that of 
the salary of the paid expert organizer. As a result of these experi- 
ments the policy in the evening recreation work tends to favor 
neighborhood organization as a distinct goal of the school-center 
activities. 
In Philadelphia the social centers which for a number of years 
were maintained by the Home and School League and allied organi- 
zations, with light, heat, and janitor service from the school board, 
have now been taken over by the recently established municipal 
board of recreation. 
The dramatic clubs that flourished in the Chicago social centers 
have been stimulated by an arrangement whereby any club success- 
ful in staging a play is allowed to present its production at other 
social centers. Through such exchanges healthy rivalries have been 
set up and the clubs have had a greater incentive to do good dramatic 
work, 
In Milwaukee, where the social centers are included under the 
“extension department” of the school board, unusual pains have 
been taken to adapt school accommodations to recreational uses. 
Some of the details of this work are set forth in the following state- 
ment by the supervisor of recreation: 
Experience has proven that the average school building can, with little difficulty 
and comparatively little expense, be made to meet the demands of evening recrea- 
tion center work. By screening windows and lights, the assembly halls are trans- 
formed into spacious gymnasiums. Basement rooms are made attractive by painting 
the cement floors, whitewashing the walls, and brightly illuminating with electricity. 
Where basement rooms are not available, the regular classrooms are used. The seats 
are put on runners or wooden strips in groups of four. By this simple device the 
schoolroom can in a few minutes be cleared of seats and desks. 
A door tender is in ‘constant attendance in the main corridor. He is there to act 
as reception committee rather than to act as police. Every possible attempt is made 
to secure for this position a man of tact and pleasing personality who can speak the 
language of the neighborhood.   
 
-P-A-G-E-500
  464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
Settees and easy chairs transform the main corridor into a lobby where neighbors 
may meet for friendly conversation. The classroom nearest the door is used as ward- 
robe where wraps may be checked free of charge. 
Each full-time center is in charge of a director, who devotes his entire time to the 
work. The centers open three evenings a week are in charge of the day-school prin- 
cipal of the building. Workers for the different activities are drawn mainly from 
the public-school teaching corps. Some are secured from the local State normal 
school and from Marquette University. 
A cooperation in the maintenance of social centers and other 
recreational activities has been effected in Grand Rapids, Mich., 
between the board of park commissioners and the board of educa- 
tion. The former maintains a superintendent of recreation and the 
latter furnishes space and facilities for his work. 
In Louisville, Ky., the five social centers are entirely supported 
by the neighborhoods in which they exist. Each center is under 
the control of a local council, which sends two representatives to a 
central council consisting of a member of the board of education, 
the superintendent of schools, the business director of the board, 
and the director of the social centers. Any neighborhood desiring 
to use its school building as a social center is obliged to send in a 
petition and guarantee the support of the center for a definite pro- 
bationary period. 
An interesting feature of the social center activities in Los Angeles, 
Cal., is the special provision which is made for immigrants who are 
planning to take out naturalization papers. The director of the 
work describes as follows one of the methods employed: 
The New Citizens’ Club meets on Thursday evenings. A few young men, some of 
whom are newly naturalized citizens and others who expect to be, are vitally inter- 
ested in the political, social, and economic questions of our day. All take part in 
the discussions, and many show surprising intelligence. Once a month there is a 
special meeting, with an address by some prominent citizen, when those who pass 
the citizenship examination at the superior court are specially invited. 
At the close of each semester recognition day services are held. All the new citizens 
who have received their second papers within the six months are specially invited 
to a banquet given by prominent citizens as hosts. Later, in the auditorium there is 
a public meeting. The program consists of addresses by leading citizens and city, 
county, and State officials; patriotic music and motion-pictures, and the ceremony 
of extending the right hand of citizenship. The meaning and value of American 
citizenship is emphasized. 
ADULT EDUCATION THROUGH LECTURES. 
Besides the annual lyceum and other courses mainly of an enter- 
taining character, there is a growing tendency among school boards 
to arrange series of public addresses having definite educational aims 
behind them, such as have for years characterized the New York 
public-school lecture system. In its simplest form this effort to in- 
crease adult education is revealed in a lecture course in the school
-P-A-G-E-501
  
PROGRESS IN WIDER USE OF SCHOOL PLANT. 465 
buildings under the management of a citizens’ committee, or some 
other voluntary body, working with the sympathetic cooperation of 
the school board. The public-health movement is prominent in these 
undertakings, and from many cities come reports of lectures on 
tuberculosis, care of the teeth, and personal hygiene, which are given 
under the auspices of local medical associations or State health 
departments. 
The arrangement of public lectures of an educational character is 
facilitated in several States now through the circulation of lantern 
slides from the State department of education. In Wisconsin the 
extension division of the State university not only loans lantern 
slides, but is providing motion-picture films. 
A more advanced type of this sort of endeavor is illustrated by 
the educational extension courses arranged each year by the school 
board of Birmingham, Ala. During the 1913-14 season 156 lectures 
were given, representing 9 courses ranging from 3 to 75 lectures. 
Some of the topics covered were: Child health and hygiene, muni- 
cipal recreation, home and school gardening, street railway trans- 
portation, and city building. All these lectures were free and were 
made possible through the generous cooperation of professional and 
business men of the community. 
In Baltimore, Md., the public lecture is utilized as a step toward 
the development of public schools as neighborhood centers. The 
arrangement of courses of public evening lectures has been made a 
duty of the first assistant superintendent of schools. For his assist- 
ance the board has appointed local committees in the districts where 
neighborhood centers are organized. Many of the lectures are de- 
voted to municipal topics, and all are planned to secure popular 
interest. At the same occasion musical numbers are provided, and 
whenever possible the lecture is connected with the meeting of some 
parent-teacher association or other body associated with the school. 
Printed invitations to these meetings are widely distributed. 
EVENING SCHOOLS SOCIALIZED. 
The night school shows signs of losing much of its traditional for- 
mality. ‘‘Our reading rooms and game rooms in the night school are 
always full’”’”—such notes as this one from Athens, Ga., indicate the 
character of the new element that is coming more and more into the 
evening-school program. Many cities now announce gymnasium 
courses that have all the attractions of organized games. In New 
York, high-school buildings occupied hy night schools have been 
opened on Friday evenings for the special benefit of organizations 
formed out of the student body. These include dramatic societies, 
literary, and debating clubs, gymnasium clubs, musical societies, and 
73226°—xp 1914—vor 1——30   
 
-P-A-G-E-502
  466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
choral organizations. In several of the evening high schools social 
dances among the students are a regular feature of the year’s work. 
Another illustration of the workings of the social motive is shown 
in the evening schools of Richmond, Va.: 
An attempt has been made to correlate social activities with the work of the regular 
night schools. An advantage of this plan is in the increased interest on the part of the 
pupils, and in saving extra heat and light. Instead of the regular night-school work 
being interrupted, it seems to be facilitated by this social work. 
This work consists of physical games, basket ball, folk dancing, athletics, literary 
and dramatic clubs, reading rooms, study hall, story telling for younger children, etc. 
Occasional talks by local talent along civic, vocational, and other educational lines 
are being conducted with satisfactory resulis. Many of these social activities have 
been made possible by the support of outside agencies, as social workers and others. 
A strong effort is being made to have the schools become community centers for all 
activities that lead to a higher standard of citizenship. 
A more elaborate working out of this idea is found in the new 
evening-school system in Pittsburgh, Pa. According to its printed 
prospectus: 
Any public-school building will be opened if a sufficient number of citizens of the 
local district call for its use as a community meeting house. Wherever the people 
organize for general meetings or activities by clubs or groups, the board will appoint 
a secretary to serve the local center in the necessary clerical and supervisory work, 
and to unify the plans and needs of the people’s organizations with the spirit and 
purpose of educational extension. The activities under social center work may 
include home and school associations, mothers’ clubs, civic and social groups, vocal 
and orchestral music, literary and athletic exercises, debates, contests, and general 
lectures and entertainments. When a social center shall call for regular class instruc- 
tion in any department, such classes, with the persons in charge, will come under 
the evening-school regulations. 
The report upon evening schools and extension work for November, 
1913, in Pittsburgh, shows that 19 schools were accommodating a 
total of 34 of these social-center groups. One of the most interesting 
results of this work is shown in the musical life which it has stimu- 
lated. In the second year of the plan there are now 5 choral societies, 
4 chorus classes, 1 class in vocal culture with a combined member- 
ship of 600, and 3 orchestras with a total membership of 60. For 
the administration of this work a department has been provided under 
the head of a ‘‘director of special schools and extension work.” 
LIBRARY EXTENSION THROUGH SCHOOL BRANCHES. 
‘There is a growing tendency to extend the use of the school 
library, that the parents as well as the children may receive benefits 
therefrom.” This note from Salt Lake City states a fact that is true 
also for other parts of the country. Throwing open the school library 
facilities is having the significant result of enriching the literary 
resources available for the pupils. How this is coming about in 
many communities is illustrated by an instance from South Orange,
-P-A-G-E-503
PROGRESS IN WIDER USE OF SCHOOL PLANT, 467 
N.J. At the Maplewood School in that city a circulating library has 
been developed by the library division of the local home and school 
association, a librarian has been installed, and the books properly 
catalogued and made accessible to the public one afternoon and one 
evening every week. The school pupils have access to this room, 
and the board of education cooperates by furnishing the room and 
some of the books. 
In some places reading rooms where current periodicals are made 
accessible to the public are being provided through the aid of indi- 
viduals and voluntary organizations. The extension of library 
facilities is coming about through the school board’s desire to increase 
the use of school buildings by the public, and the library board’s 
desire to get more books to the public. Where cooperation between 
these two boards has been effected, one of the first results is to permit 
the use of schoolhouses as distributing stations. The outgrowth of 
this movement is the installation of branch libraries in the school- 
house, as is illustrated in the case of Grand Rapids, Mich.; Erie, Pa.; 
and a number of other cities. School children going to and from 
school make good distributors of circulating books, while the loca- 
tion of the library branch in the schoolhouse makes its facilities 
more accessible both to the neighborhood and to the school’s pupils. 
THE HIGH SCHOOL AS AN ART CENTER. 
The well-known art gallery in the Richmond (Ind.) High School 
has now a rival in the Municipal Art Gallery located in the foyer of 
the new Washington Irving High School, New York City. At the 
free exhibitions which have already been held in the Irving School 
the collections have come from private homes, art societies, and the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art. The gallery is open to the public 
during school days from 8 a.m. to 9.30 p. m., on Saturday mornings, 
and on Sundays from 1 to 5 p.m. In the securing of material the 
principal has the cooperation of the high school’s department of art, 
several art societies, and the Gramercy Neighborhood Association. 
EXTENSION OF DAY ACTIVITIES. 
A longer day school program, such as obtains in Gary, Ind., repre- 
sents a tendency that is found in an increasing number of school 
systems. In many places the gymnasium facilities are thrown open 
to the boys and girls for periods immediately after the close of school. 
This is also a favorite hour for band rehearsals, meetings of mothers’ 
clubs, improvement associations, and folk dancing classes. In 
Grand Rapids, Mich., domestic science classes for parochial pupils 
are held in several schoolhouses from 4 to 6 p.m. In Louisville, 
Ky., and Milwaukee, the social centers are open in the afternoon. 
 
-P-A-G-E-504
; 
468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
In New York City school playground work has been inaugurated at 
163 public schools under the direction of the department of physical 
training. In a number of cities school buildings have been opened 
Saturday mornings for various activities, such as classes in domestic 
science and physical and manual training. The laundry installed 
in the basement of the Lincoln School, Lexington, Ky., is open 
after school hours throughout the week for the use of the housewives 
of the neighborhood. At Fort Dodge, Iowa, the shower baths in 
one of the new buildings are open Saturday afternoons for boys and 
in the evenings for men, under the supervision of the physical train- 
ing teacher. 
These are only a few of the instances of this kind of school exten- 
sion. 
ADAPTING SCHOOL BUILDINGS FOR COMMUNITY USE. 
The superintendents’ letters make many references to the installa- 
tion of electric lights, bathing and gymnasium equipment, movable 
classroom furniture, and screens for lanterns. More significant still, 
numerous cities are adding new rooms to old school buildings for the 
purpose of meeting some new community demand. For example, in 
Everett, Wash., a school has received an addition which contains 
quarters for settlement work and a branch of the city library, as well 
as a ground-floor auditorium. From Stockton, Cal., comes the 
report of an extension to a high school which contains accommo- 
dations for manual training, and a capacious gymnasium. The 
latter is equipped with elevated seats along the sides for 700 people. 
On occasion several hundred more can be seated on the main floor 
by bringing in chairs. The new equipment is provided for student- 
body dances, bazaars, and various social gatherings. 
In respect to new buildings, a typical comment is from Spokane, 
Wash.: “All our new buildings are equipped with assembly rooms.” 
In Oakland, Cal., club rooms are also provided in new ward buildings. 
Harrisburg, Pa., reports a 12-classroom building with an auditorium 
having capacity for 750 people. According to the plans adopted, 
this auditorium will have movable seats, in order that the room may 
be used for a variety of purposes. A gymnasium is also planned 
for the building, which will cost, exclusive of grounds and equip- 
ment, about $90,000. The newest style of Jersey City public school 
has a library and reading room available for use as a branch of the 
public library by the public during and after school hours. 
As might naturally be expected, the new high schools also show 
many provisions for a larger public use. Wallace, Idaho, is con- 
structing a building which will have a gymnasium with considerable 
audience space, an auditorium, a swimming pool, and a bowling 
alley. The new high school in Selma, Ala., has two auditoriums;  
-P-A-G-E-505
  PROGRESS IN WIDER USE OF SCHOOL PLANT. 469 
the smaller, with a seating capacity of 150, is designed especially for 
the accommodation of women’s clubs and for occasions when a large 
auditorium is not desirable. 
The most striking consideration of community needs in school- 
house structures is being shown in several new schools which have 
been given by individual benefactors. Evanston, IIL, reports a 
“neighborhood house” for smokers, card clubs, and sewing circles, 
which was donated by a benevolent citizen, who also contributes 
$1,500 a year for extension work. In Natchez, Miss., the Carpenter 
Memorial School, a building having capacity for 400 elementary 
children, has not only an assembly room, gymnasium, and swimming 
pool, but also generous space for library work. These latter facilities 
include reading, stack, and reference rooms. Woodworking and 
domestic science quarters are also provided. 
In Waitsburg, Wash., a $40,000 school has been given to the city 
which has a very complete equipment for vocational and physical 
education. Its capacious gymnasium is fitted with a collapsible 
platform and folding chairs so that it can be used for large meetings 
and school entertainments. The domestic science rooms have 
equipment for serving a large number of pupils. Bowling alleys 
and a swimming pool are also provided. 
SCHOOL EXTENSION IN RURAL DISTRICTS. 
In the brief space available but slight mention can be made of the 
multitudinous evidences of the growth of activities in country 
schoolhouses. From many States come reports of farmers’ institutes, 
lyceum and Chautauqua courses, meetings of school improvement 
leagues, and agricultural extension courses. In Wisconsin, where 
the agitation for a more sociable country life is very active, the uni- 
versity extension division is sending out lecturers, lantern slides, 
motion-picture films, and suggestive programs for neighborhood 
moetings and is arranging community festivals. At its suggestion 
in one of the townships the school board has arranged for adults free 
transportation by omnibuses to evening gatherings in the township 
high school. Several other State departments are also lending lan- 
tern slides, sending out handbooks for civic-center activities, and 
stimulating the formation of local associations for parents and 
teachers. As a result of the agitation for improved agriculture, 
tomato clubs, corn, cotton, and hog clubs, are being formed in many 
sections of the country. All of these center at the district school 
and increase its importance to the community. 
In many districts the new buildings have additional rooms for 
domestic science and manual training; these rooms are also adapted 
to social and recreational uses by the community. Along with this 
larger equipment there is a considerable extension of library facilities.  
-P-A-G-E-506
470 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
One of the most important factors in this movement is the township 
high school. A notable example is the new La Salle-Peru (IIL) 
Township high school. The main building contains a large audi- 
torium, which is separate from the regular high school assembly room. 
The domestic science department is equipped to provide hot lunches 
in a regular dining room at a trifling cost. A social center building, 
donated by a local philanthropist, is attached to the main school by a 
roofed gallery. It contains a large swimming pool, bowling alleys, 
gymnasium, auditorium, library, reading rooms, and space for 
billiards and pool. The obvious service which such an equipment 
ean. render to country life will undoubtedly be influential in bringing 
about the incorporation of similar accommodations in other township 
schools throughout the country.

GENERAL SURVEY. 
In a general survey restricted to the library activities of a single 
year the most that can be done is to record briefly those features of 
the year that stand forth as especially worthy of mention, denoting 
(1) certain tendencies in library practice, (2) innovations of general 
interest, (3) noteworthy examples of progress, or (4) important facts 
in the year’s history. 7 
The year has been one of general advance. New libraries have 
been established in every State; reports from all quarters speak of 
increased equipment and increased use of libraries; appropriations for 
public, school, and university libraries have as a rule been larger; 
new efforts have been made to reach those outside the bounds of 
library service, particularly in rural sections; more intelligent and 
systematic attempts have been made to acquaint the general public 
with what libraries offer and with the educational work they are 
performing. 
Few people have as yet any real conception of the use that can be 
made of the free library. Therefore it is the task of every able libra- 
rian to wage a steady campaign of publicity and enlightenment as 
to the service his institution can render. According to investigations 
recently made by the assistant librarian of Los Angeles, not more 
than one-fifth of the people of the average city use the public library. 
Of the remaining four-fifths one-fifth have either no time or no desire 
to read, and another fifth are either illiterate or else too young to read. 
Two-fifths are prospective readers, and every annual report on library 
conditions should indicate some increase of the fraction representing 
actual users. ‘Mr. Bailey, of the Wilmington, Del., library, thinks 
473
-P-A-G-E-510
  474 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
that the relatively small number of library patrons is partly because 
librarians do not know the home conditions of the people, and there- 
fore can not fit the book to the individual or family. He thinks 
perhaps the final solution for the city as well as the country librarian 
will be the book wagon, already so successful in country districts. 
No doubt we are entering the “ take-books-to-readers”’ era. 
Dr. Melvil Dewey said recently: 
We have broadened our ideas like circles in the water. Thisis the genesis ofaccessi- ~ 
bility: (1) Books to be consulted only by a favored few; (2) by any who paid the fee; 
(3) freely by all, but no book to leave the building. Then came loaning: (1) To the 
favored few; (2) to those who paid the fee; (3) and then this splendid modern concep- 
tion of free as air or water to all. Now we are in the third age of branch stations and 
deliveries by wagons, motors, messenger, express, or mail. The new parcel post 
greatly stimulated the bibliothecal imagination.* 
Branches or deposit stations for lending books for home use have 
been established not only in buildings erected or rented for the pur- 
pose, but also in schools, manufacturing plants, park field houses and 
playgrounds, department stores, fire and police stations, suburban 
drug and grocery stores, Young Men’s Christian Association and 
Young Women’s Christian Association buildings, institutional 
churches, and elsewhere. Cleveland, Ohio, for example, has 547 
agencies for placing books at the disposal of its citizens; Seattle, 
Wash., 496; and Portland, Oreg., 908 (distributed throughout the 
county). Extension of library privileges onthe part of cities to 
neighboring communities has been a frequent topic at State library 
association and library club meetings. 
There has been a steady growth of the county library plan. Twenty- 
six California counties have county libraries. Their popularity is 
growing in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Oregon, Wisconsin, Washing- 
ton, and Montana. Cincinnati and Portland (Oreg.) serve their 
respective counties with such signal success that other important cities 
are planning to imitate them. The American Library Association is 
planning to issue soon a handbook on the subject that will give useful 
advice to communities and library boards. 
Appropriations for libraries have been on the whole more liberal 
this past year than ever before, and the limit of the tax rate, where 
there is a limit, is becoming less restrictive. The obligation of the 
community to furnish and sustain the free library as it maintains the 
free school is more fully recognized than ever,? and as an indication 
of the welcome accorded the library and the privileges it offers, it is 
interesting to learn that a petition for a branch library in a certain 
portion of Chicago was signed by more than 10,000 residents of the 
neighborhood.

LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1913-14, 475 
NATIONAL AID. 
The importance and magnitude of the service rendered to the libra- 
ries of the country peculiarly impressed those who attended the con- 
ference of the American Library Association in Washington, D. C., in 
May, 19141 According to a handbook compiled for that occasion, 
there are 137 libraries in the District of Columbia, having an aggre- 
gate of 5,674,000 volumes and pamphlets, about four-fifths of which 
are in libraries supported directly by the Government, and the service 
represented in this vast collection of books is more or less directly at 
the disposal of the country at large. 
The most important of these agencies is naturally the Library of 
Congress. The appropriation act for 1914-15 provided means for the 
extension of its activities by the establishment of a legislative refer- 
ence department; $25,000 was appropriated to ‘“‘enable the Librarian 
of Congress to employ competent persons to prepare such indexes, 
digests, and compilations of Jaw as may be required for Congress and 
other official use pursuant to the act approved June 30, 1906.” This 
legislation is regarded as the initial step toward a larger undertaking 
to embrace service usually contemplated in a legislative reference 
bureau. The first undertaking under this act is the resumption of the 
indexing of the Statutes at Large. This will comprise a supplement 
to the general laws enacted since 1907, at which point the present 
index stops; also a separate index to the private and local acts from 
the beginning. Since its present administration began, the Library 
of Congress has continuously rendered to Congress a service similar to 
that of a legislative reference bureau. It has not, however, been 
equipped hitherto, except in occasional instances, to meet requests 
from Congress for digests, translations, or comprehensive statements. 
For bill drafting it has had absolutely no provision. 
The accessions to the Library of Congress during the year were: 
Books, 125,054; maps and charts, 6,489; music (volumes and pieces), 
32,675; prints (pieces), 16,318. 
The most important accession of the year was Mr. Jacob H. Schifl’s 
second notable gift, consisting of more than 4,200 volumes to reenforce 
the collection of Semitica given by him to the library in 1912. It 
includes about 120 manuscripts, chiefly biblical, cabalistic, and litur- 
gical. 
Through the services of Dr. Fung, in China, the collection of Chi- 
nese literature received an increase of 6,467 volumes, embracing 
works dealing chiefly with lexicography, history, and physiography, 
the arts, agriculture, medicine, bibliography, and epigraphy; but in- 
cluding also many collected works, series, and encyclopedias.

  476 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The manuscripts have been enriched by several private collections. 
Special interest attaches to the papers of the Mercy-Argenteau family, 
one of the oldest and most distinguished families of Belgium, the his- 
torical record of whose activities goes back to the tenth century. 
The publications for the year embrace bibliographical lists on Fed- 
eral control, water rights, boycotts, and eight-hour working day. 
The music division has brought out a catalogue of opera librettos 
and a monograph on ‘‘The Star-Spangled Banner.” 
The admission of books to the parcel post, beginning with March 16, 
1914, is having an important bearing on library development, par- 
ticularly on the work of State library commissions, which can now 
reach cheaply and quickly localities remote from freight or express 
stations. 
The Underwood tariff, which made important changes in the duties 
on, books and their material, did not affect libraries, as the clause per- 
mitting incorporated institutions to import books free of duty re- 
mains unchanged. 
COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. 
It has been, asserted in the past that college and university libra- 
ries have not kept pace with public libraries. Recently, however, 
the situation has shown signs of improvement. At many universi- 
ties the library building has been made the architectural center of the 
campus and this is having an intellectual influence. The dignity 
and importance of the university library have recently been em- 
phasized in a number of public addresses. At the meeting of the 
Association of American Universities, at Urbana, Ill., November, 
1913,1 Dr. W. Dawson Johnston, speaking on ‘The Library as a 
University Factor,” declared that a library is not so much a collection 
of books as a form of service. At the same meeting the position, of ad- 
vanced scholarship was voiced by Dean Ford, of the University of 
Minnesota, who said that without access to library facilities no uni- 
versity is a university; that it ought to be a commonplace of graduate 
school policy that the library be recognized as the one all-important 
institution making possible or impossible, by its strength or weakness, 
real university work by students and instructors.2 A municipal ref- 
erence bureau has been organized by the general extension division 
of the University of Minnesota, which will act as a clearing house for 
information and ideas concerning municipal problems. Its informa- 
tion will be at the disposal of all cities of the State. A similar bureau 
was recently established in the University of California. The sum of 
$65,000 was given to the University of California for a classroom and 
library building at the university farm and agricultural school at 
Davis.

LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1913-14. 477 
At Yale University a record of the amount spent for books, accord- 
ing to subject, is kept for guidance in determining the policy of future 
purchases. A library manual was prepared containing a description 
of all operations in the library. During the year the library bor- 
rowed 111 items from 15 libraries and loaned 239 to 44 libraries. 
The need of additional buildings for the central library is keenly felt.t 
In Princeton University greater use than ever before was made of 
student help. The experiment was made as the result of representa- 
tions by the library that (1) for the student who is working his way 
through college the opportunity to earn money in the library is often 
more appreciated by the student than free scholarship; and (2) that 
the library can use for library work, or for the preparation of aids to 
‘research, or by organizing actual research, any amount of student 
help that can be provided. 
Student use of the library in the University of California is increas- 
ing so rapidly that the reading room seating 700 in the Doe Library, 
completed only four years ago, is already taxed to its limit and plans 
are on foot for an early enlargement. There were added 22,325 
volumes to the library during the year, making a total of about 
282,000 volumes now in the library. The staff numbers about 40, 
exclusive of student assistants, and the appropriation for the past 
year was $80,500. 
LIBRARY INSTRUCTION IN COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES, AND NORMAL 
SCHOOLS. 
The Bureau of Education during the year issued a bulletin con- 
taining the results of an informal inquiry into library instruction in 
colleges, universities, and normal schools.? From this bulletin it 
appears that 91 universities and colleges reported courses more or less . 
adequate and complete in the book arts. Of the normal schools, 93 
reported instruction in library methods, emphasis being laid on the 
organization and administration of school libraries and the study of 
children’s literature. Supplementing the information given in the 
bulletin the following should be noted: 
Colby College, Waterville, Me., Dr. Charles P. Chipman, librarian.—Two courses in 
bibliography: Course ‘‘A,’’ required of all freshmen, consists of individual instruction 
given by the librarian or his assistant; course ‘‘1-2”’ is three periods, a total of five 
hours, weekly. The latter course treats of books and their makers; libraries, ancient 
and modern; cataloguing, classification, and the making of bibliographies. ‘The 3 
aim of this course is not to prepare students for library work, but to give them such a 
knowledge of library science as will be of practical value in teaching a professional 
study of business.’’     
1 Those who are fearful of the spread of disease through books will be reassured by an interesting investi- 
gation made at Yale University this year. During the cleaning of the library a chemical analysis of the 
dust was made. About 50 per cent was mineral matter thought to be coal ashes and street dust, and the 
remaining 50 per cent was organic material, paper fiber, wood fiber, and molds. No mouth bacteria were 
found, and in general the analysis showed the harmlessness of the dust.

  478 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
University of Washington, Seattle, Wash., William E. Henry, librarian.—Freshmen in 
the college of arts and sciences are required to take one hour a week the first semester 
in instruction in the use of the library and the use of books; one hour a week the second 
semester in the choice of studies and selecting a vocation. One credit is given for the 
year’s work. 
State College of Washington, Pullman, Wash., Albert S. Wilson, librarian.—This 
institution has a course of nine lectures on the use of the library, which is required of 
all freshmen and is open to others. The course is made practical by requiring, in con- 
nection with each recitation, answers in writing to a set of questions involving the use 
of various catalogues and bibliographic tools, Students are divided into classes of 30 
for this course. 
The library courses extend through the junior and senior years and consist of five 
recitations per week through the four semesters and six laboratory hours per week 
through the last three semesters. The completion of this curriculum gives the degree 
of bachelor of arts and a certificate indicating the amount of instruction in library ~ 
economy. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Tempe Normal School, Tempe, Ariz., Ruth M. Wright, librarian.—The object of the 
course in library instruction is to familiarize students with the use of books and libra- 
ries. There is special work for the class on the valuation of a school library. The 
following topics are considered: Structure and arranged parts of a book; classification 
and arrangement of the library; use of the card catalogue and periodicals and diction- 
aries. In the second year periodicals and periodical indexes, together with reference 
books, are considered, while members of the senior class give attention to buying and 
selecting books with special reference to children’s literature; use of Government 
documents. 
Kent State Normal School, Kent, Ohio, Margaret Dunbar, head of department of 
library science.—Six weeks’ course required of all students entering for the normal 
certificate. The course is planned to help the student to get the best he can from 
the library while he resides at the scheol and to help the prospective teacher to select, 
organize, care for, and use a school library. 
State Normal School, Monmouth, Oreg., Mabel G. West, librarian.—Courses in library 
methods: 
Course I is a course of five lectures required of all entering students, the main idea 
of which is to make the students at home in the library. The work is given during the 
first two weeks of each semester and covers the following: Rules and regulations; 
classification and arrangement of books; use of the card catalogue; magazine indexes; 
reference books; investigating a subject in the library; work of the Oregon State 
Library, etc. 
Course II is required of all students before they graduate from the Normal. Two 
periodsa week are given to the work, which runs through a semester of 20 weeks. One 
period each week is devoted to the technical side of the work and one to the study of 
children’s books. Each lecture on the technical part of the work is followed by a 
practice period. 
Winthrop Normal and Industrial College, Rockhill, S. C., Ida J. Dacus, librarian — 
Two courses: One in reference work, which takes up the subjects of classification, 
catalogues, indexes, and standard reference books, and is required of all freshmen; 
the second course is one in elementary library methods for school-teachers, and is 
required of every student taking the normal course for graduation. 
Whitewater State Normal School, Whitewater, Wis—Courses are given in library 
methods and library use, as follows: 
Library methods (18 weeks).—First semester, 8.55-9.45. Senior elective. The 
course in library methods offers instruction in the care and use of school libraries and
-P-A-G-E-515
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1913-14. 479 
includes the study ef the make-up of a book and its repair, the principles.of book 
selection, the mechanical preparation of books for the shelves, classification, acces- 
sioning, shelf listing, and cataloguing, the township library law and discussion of the 
books on the township library list, the use of pictures and periodicals in the school, 
and methods of instructing children in the use of books and the library. Each stu- 
dent prepares a sample catalogue and does other practical work in connection with 
the class instruction. 
Library use.—A series of six lessons given by the librarian in connection with the 
required English courses, designed to give a knowledge of the use of books and a 
library. It includes a study of the resources of the normal library, their classifica- 
tion and arrangement, the catalogue, indexes, and other bibliographical aids; an 
acquaintance with the more useful reference books; and the making of a bibliography. 
The State of Michigan has made special efforts to do library work 
in normal schools and other institutions preparing teachers. Mrs. 
Mary C. Spencer, State librarian, reports that for eight years the 
State library and the State board of library commissioners have con- 
ducted summer schools in connection with the Marquette and Kala- 
mazoo County normal and the Ferris Institute at Big Rapids. More 
recently this work has been extended to Bay View. The Northern 
State Normal School of Michigan was one of the first normal schools 
in the United States to give a special course in children’s literature. 
This was organized in 1889, in charge of Miss G. P. Hill.t 
That the importance of library instruction is becoming better 
realized in institutions other than colleges and normal schools is indi- 
cated by the course given at the Crozer Theological Seminary, 
Chester, Pa. Since 1910 Dr. Frank G. Lewis, the librarian, has given 
a course of studies in library economy. The following is a list of 
subjects: Significance of books and library science; purchase and 
handling of books; book classification and arrangement; cataloguing 
and catalogues; periodical literature; indexes, and how to use them; 
bibliography and bibliographies; library buildings and library ad- 
ministration; the library and the community; library extension and 
traveling libraries; the minister and the local library. 
LIBRARY SCHOOLS.? 
A new library school, especially intended to prepare librarians for 
California cities and counties, was started at the California State 
Library in January, 1914. The course of instruction is similar to 
that of other library schools. No tuition is charged. 
The Riverside (Cal.) Public Library conducted a six-week winter 
library school from January 19 to February 28, 1914. The library 
school at Drexel Institute, Philadelphia, was discontinued in June, 
1914.3 The library school of Western Reserve University, Cleveland, 
Ohio, is offering a course this year on ‘‘The public library and com-

munity welfare.” The library school of the New York Public Li- 
brary announces a municipal reference course for the year 1914-15. 
The library schools are tending to give their courses greater elas- 
ticity to meet the special requirements of their students, oppor- 
tunities being given for specialization in cataloguing, administration, 
children’s work, municipal reference work, normal work, or for what- 
ever department of library work the students wish especially to pre- 
pare. Instruction in library work and methods for those either 
holding library positions or under appointment to positions was given 
by many State library commissions and State universities. Included 
in these were schools in Indiana, California, Missouri, Minnesota, 
Utah, Michigan (State library), Wisconsin, New Jersey, Pennsyl- 
vania, New York, and at Columbia University, University of Illinois, 
University of Iowa, University of Michigan, University of Tennessee, 
Simmons College, and Chautauqua, N. Y. A correspondence course 
is offered by the University of Chicago. Library institutes, held in a 
number of States, are given special prominence in New York in the 
work of the State library and the State library association. The 
total attendance in 1913, in the number of libraries or communities 
represented and in the number of persons participating exceeded that 
of any previous year. There were represented 423 institutions or 
places compared with 401 the year before. The New York State 
library school held an institute in July, 1914, for district superin- 
tendents of schools. 
The University of Wisconsin library school has made an important 
change in its arrangement with the university regarding the joint- 
course students. Previously these students took the library school 
work during their junior and senior years, mingling it with their 
university work and receiving 20 credits of the 120 required for 
graduation. Under the new arrangements students must have at 
least 96 of the 120 credits before beginning library school work. 
This plan results in better preliminary preparation and more inten- 
sive work by the students. 
In 1913 the library schools graduated about 300 young men and 
women, principally women, ready to take up active library duties. 
Nearly all the large public libraries of the country conduct training 
classes to provide for their own needs. 
STATE AID, LIBRARY COMMISSIONS, AND TRAVELING LIBRARIES. 
The work of the State library commissions shows expansion in all 
parts of the country; even those commissions whose appropria- 
tions were not increased have succeeded in rendering increased 
services. 
New York’s report for the past year is noteworthy. The 477 free 
lending libraries reporting for 1913 possessed a stock of 4,707,472
-P-A-G-E-517
  
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1913-14. 481 
volumes and loaned 21,530,294 books—a gain over 1912 of over a 
quarter of a million in stock and a million in circulation. Since 1893 
there has been a fivefold growth in free libraries and a ninefold growth 
in public use of these libraries. In their financial statements the 
libraries show a total of $3,814,875 available for the year’s expense, of 
which $1,738,420 was provided from local taxation; this is greater 
by $116,988 than in the preceding year. Of the 52 cities of the State, 
46 are now provided with free public libraries. The parcel post is 
helping the extension department of the State library to place books 
more easily and economically than ever before at the disposal of 
every library, school, club, and individual of the State. During the 
year there were 1,114 traveling libraries sent out; the greatest num- 
ber in any preceding year was 852. The greater proportion are sent 
to study clubs and rural schools. Of the 10,541 school districts in 
the State, there are only 51 maintaining schools that are without 
libraries. 
In Massachusetts the commission supplied books to 68 towns of the 
State; traveling libraries were sent to 94 towns and villages; collec- 
tions of pictures were sent to 120 places; the library agent made 157 
visits; 9 new libraries were organized. The appropriation for aid- 
ing free public libraries in small towns was increased from $4,000 to 
$10,000. 
Pennsylvania has 142 free libraries; 10 years ago it had 67. During 
the past year 214 visits by commission officials were made, 8 new 
libraries organized, and several older ones aided in reorganization. 
The commission and the State Federation of Pennsylvania Women 
are in close cooperation. Volumes to the number of 17,884 were sent 
out by the traveling library department to 327 points in the State. 
The Illinois library extension commission received a somewhat 
increased appropriation and has enlarged its work. Twice as many 
traveling libraries were sent out last year; programs were made for 
women’s clubs; books were purchased for work with rural schools; 
three library institutes were held; and many visits of inspection were 
made. ‘The libraries of Illinois have been placed in an embarrassing 
position by the legal interpretation of the Juul amendment passed at 
the last assembly. According to the opinion rendered, the amend- 
ment does not affect library taxes; no legal remedy can be applied 
for at least two years to come. 
Libraries in Ohio, due to legislative measures, find themselves also 
much hampered by decreased income. - 
Indiana reports the establishment of 17 new public libraries, one 
of which is in a county heretofore possessing no public library. The 
State library commission arranged for 107 free lectures in 35 public 
libraries.

  482 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
In Iowa several new libraries were placed under tax support, and 
a number of new buildings were dedicated. Rural extension received 
much attention, and the traveling library work was largely increased 
in all departments. 
Wisconsin has always given prominence to its traveling libraries. 
This year theso were sent to 773 separate communities, an increase of 
100 over the previous year and about twice the number of com- 
munities actually reached five years ago. Groups of books on agri- 
cultural topics have been especially emphasized. The commission 
has plans under way, based on the new parcel-post rates for books, 
for providing better reading facilities for rural districts than have 
ever been possible before. A separate department known as the 
study club and book selection department has been established. 
In Missouri 326 traveling libraries were loaned, 46 more than in 
the previous year; 40 package libraries on recall of judges, Philippine 
independence, Panama Canal tolls, and labor arbitration have been 
formed and put in the field. 
The Kentucky library commission supplies traveling libraries to 
182 stations in 81 counties, in many of which these traveling libraries 
were the only available books except the school textbooks. The 
commission has assisted the State institutions in library organizing 
and administration. A graded list of 100 books, to constitute a 
model library for county graded schools, was compiled on request of 
the State supervisor of rural schools. The work with rural schools 
has been greatly increased. 
Returns to the New Jersey commission show that 250 library 
centers in the State loaned about 8,000,000 books during the year; 
163 visits were made to libraries by commission officers; 8 libra- 
ries were organized and 4 reorganized; 8 granges started reference 
collections; and a number of round tables were held in different 
parts of the State. 
There are in California 26 county free libraries; 2 library district 
libraries; 3 high-school district libraries; 131 libraries supported by 
city taxation; 66 law libraries, of which 55 are county law libraries; 
58 county teachers’ libraries; 334 libraries in educational institutions, 
of which 6 are universities, 7 are colleges, 7 are normal schools, 248 are 
public high schools, and 66 are private schools and other institutions; 
48 miscellaneous institution libraries and 69 association or society 
libraries; 42 subscription, libraries. In connection with the above 
libraries there are 928 branches and deposit stations. There are 133 
library buildings, of which 115 were gifts, and of these gifts 98 are 
from Andrew Carnegie. 
The North Carolina commission secured from the State board of 
agriculture an annual appropriation of $600 for the purchase of
-P-A-G-E-519
  LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1913-14, 483 
books on agriculture and country life, which will be used to help the 
farmers of the State. 
The North Dakota commission cooperated with the State board 
of control in reorganizing the penitentiary library. 
Utah has been especially conspicuous the past two or three years for 
new library buildings. 
The Vermont free public library commission has in use 161 general 
traveling libraries, 211 school libraries; 104 study club libraries, and 
88 picture collections. The use of these collections has doubled in 
the past two years. 
An unusual effort to encourage the establishment of public libraries 
is seen in Indiana, where a member of the public library commission 
has offered 20 cash prizes, aggregating $150, for the best essays on 
“Why my community should establish a public library.” The con- 
test is open only to the school pupils of the nine counties that are 
without libraries. 
Efforts for commissions are being made in Oklahoma, Wyoming, 
and Montana, and Washington has attempted to secure legislation 
enlarging the functions of its commission. 
COOPERATION. 
Library commissions and State associations in their meetings this 
year have dwelt more than ever before on the problem how to make 
the book a vital force in the life of the rural dweller. The problem 
is by no means solved when the book is placed in the hands of the 
farmer, his wife or his child. Efficiency in labor, so as to conserve 
time to read, must be taught; and education must be of the kind 
that gives the desire to read. So librarians are learning to join hands 
with those conducting farmers’ institutes; with the county agents 
of the Department of Agriculture, of whom there are more than a 
thousand actively at work; with the granges; with the extension 
departments of the State universities; and with the public schools. 
There is here a vast field for cooperation that librarians are just begin- 
ning to enter. 
The Chicago Public Library has adopted the cooperative scheme, 
in establishing branch libraries in manufacturing and commercial 
plants, and offering to establish libraries where suitable rooms are 
set aside and the salaries of the necessary librarian and assistants are 
paid by the employer. The plan has proved popular, and about 27 
libraries are operating on this basis. 
At the 1913 conference of the Special Libraries Association, at 
Kaaterskill, N. Y., a cooperative plan was formulated for collecting 
and distributing to subscribers information regarding new publica- 
tions, pamphlets, documents, bibliographies, type-written material, 
etc., of special interest to legislative and municipal reference libraries.
-P-A-G-E-520
  484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
This service has proved successful enough to warrant readjustment 
and enlargement, and the H. W. Wilson Co., publishers of biblio- 
graphical and library aids, has launched a new weekly periodical, 
the ‘‘Public Affairs Index, ” in which the service will be broadened 
and much enlarged and the data cumulated biweekly. 
A fund has been raised by certain firms and individuals of Boston 
to employ an interlibrary research worker who will not, in the prosecu- 
tion of her work, be content with the resources of any one library, but 
by correspondence and personal visits to various libraries will endeavor 
to exhaust the field of information before rendering a report. Boston 
libraries have undertaken, the preparation of a union list of all periodi- 
cals useful for research work received in the 54 public and private 
libraries of the city. 
The General Federation of Women’s Clubs at its biennial meeting 
in Chicago, in June, held a conference on library extension. The 
following topics were among those discussed: How to secure a State 
library commission; More liberal library legislation; Book selection; 
The extension of available resources to the isolated and less-favored 
districts; The kind of literature to be furnished; and The general 
relation of libraries to clubs. The committee on library extension 
of the Ohio federation of women’s clubs has conducted a survey of 
library conditions in the prisons and county institutions, and has 
taken steps to secure, in cooperation with the State library associa- 
tion, a library survey of the State. 
The National Education Association has had a library department 
for nearly 20 years; exceptionally helpful meetings were held at St. 
Paul in July. The National Council of Teachers of English recently 
established a library section, which it is believed will be of much 
benefit to high school and normal school libraries. The Conference 
for Education in the South also has a library department. 
The American Federation of Arts has for a number of years cooper- 
ated with libraries by lending paintings, drawings, photographs of 
sculpture and architecture, lectures and lantern slides. Each lecture 
has been written by a person who is an authority and is illustrated 
by about 50 slides. The City Art Museum of St. Louis hangs the 
best of its recent acquisitions in the St. Louis Public Library at 
regular intervals. The St. Louis library cooperated actively in the 
preparation and production of the Pageant and Masque of St. Louis 
in May, 1914. 
An illustration of the proper sort of cooperation between different 
departments is seen in Virginia where the State auditor has sent to 
the State library all the ancient records in the possession of his office. 
An increasing number of articles on libraries and library work are 
appearing in nonlibrary periodicals.

LIBRARY WORK IN SCHOOLS. 
The growing importance of library work in high and normal 
schools is one of the noticeable features of the year. The American 
Library Association, the library department of the National Edu- 
cation Association, and the National Council of Teachers of English 
have all made this phase of work prominent during the past year, 
and much has been accomplished through cooperation between these 
and other associations. 
Vocational guidance is being seriously undertaken by nearly all 
the prominent public and school libraries. Cooperation with the 
schools in this work is generally intimate and systematic. In Port- 
land, Oreg., a professor of the University of Oregon meets weekly

vocation or courses of study. 
Every country school in Wisconsin has a small library of good 
books. There are nearly a million and a half volumes in these rural 
school libraries, costing over half a million dollars. The Wisconsin 
State department of public instruction has compiled a new township 
school library list of about 1,450 titles, which will be in force for 
two years from April 1, 1914. 
Library agencies in a number of States are recommending the 
schools to set aside a “‘Library day’? — 
on which teachers and children shall be reminded of the part that books and reading 
have in human life and education and on which day the various interests of the school 
library shall be set forth and emphasized. 
All the public libraries of the country are each year doing an 
increasing amount of work with the schools. The school buildings 
are made library deposit stations and branch libraries, the scholars 
come regularly to the library on assigned work, and particular at- 
tention is given to the needs of teachers. In Portland, Oreg., for 
example, 300,000 books, or nearly one-third of the total circula- 
tion for home use, were borrowed from the school deposits. In- 
struction in the use of the library and talks on books were given to 
31,435 pupils in 968 classes, partly in the school, partly in the library. 
Most large libraries have a teachers’ room equipped with all sorts of 
pedagogical helps; in some libraries these helps include a set of 
Montessori apparatus. Librarians are cooperating actively with 
parent-teacher associations. Many libraries have printed lists of 
books particularly applicable to school work or to children of school 
age. Two of the most important of these recent lists are those of 
the Boston and Washington (D. C.) public libraries. In the latter 
city the circulation of juvenile books has increased fivefold in the 
last 10 years, chiefly due to the deposits made in the school buildings. 
Representatives of library commissions in many States visit the

rural schools, study their needs, place traveling libraries suitable 
thereto, and give informal talks to the teachers. 
The Rochester (N. Y.) Public Library investigated what 1,500 
school children did between Friday and the following Monday, and 
found that reading claimed more of their time than any other recre- 
ation. The Rochester Board of Education has cooperated with the 
public library by turning over to the latter its collection of about 
16,000 grade library books. These are managed by the library for 
the schools, the school board retaining the title to the books, buying 
new ones, and keeping the old ones in repair. Instead of changing 
the collection occasionally, as is done in most places, each grade has 
a permanent collection of 70 volumes. 
The Council of the American Library Association, at its meeting 
in Washington, D. C., in May, 1914, passed resolutions on library 
service in schools and on the qualifications of school librarians.* 
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. 
The 1914 conference of the American Library Association was held 
in Washington, D. C., May 24-29. The attendance was 1,366, the 
largest in the history of the association. Delegates were present 
from 87 States, the District of Columbia, and Canada. For the first 
time in several years there were no representatives from abroad. 
The principal consideration at the various sessions was the service 
performed by the National Government through its many depart- 
ments to the library interests of the country, and the value of the 
conference largely lay in promoting the coordination of Federal, State, 
and other agencies. 
The conference was held under the presidency of Edwin H. An- 
derson, director of the New York Public Library. In his presidential 
address, ‘‘The tax on ideas,” he emphasized that the United States 
is one of the few enlightened countries to place a tariff on books. 
J. Franklin Jameson spoke on ‘‘The need of a national archive 
building,” and said that the United States is one of the few civi- 
lized nations which does not possess adequate housing for its archive 
material. Commissioner Claxton, of the Bureau of Education, ad- 
vocated greater extension of library facilities among the rural popu- 
lation, outlining a plan for supplying every county in the land with 
a free public library. John, Foster Carr, director of the Immigrant 
Education Society, of New York, presented the needs of the foreign 
born and the influence of good reading in making good citizens. 
Katharine H. Wootten, librarian of Atlanta, Ga., presented a paper 
on library development in the South since 1907—the year when the 
association last met in that section—and said that approximately 91

        LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1913-14. 487 
libraries had been built in 14 Southern States at an expenditure of 
more than $1,500,000 since 1907. Mr. Carlton, of the Newberry 
Library, Chicago, warned librarians that the modern demands of 
administration and business in their library work were robbing them 
of the old-time prestige possessed by the librarian who actually knew 
his books. He feared that ‘‘at present, intellect is dragged like a 
captive behind the chariot of utility.’ Mr. Bolton, of the Boston 
Atheneum, spoke on ‘‘The present trend.” He said the movement 
of the time was toward beautiful and useful branch libraries; that 
the immigrant population now utilizing the libraries occasioned a 
movement toward laying quite as much stress upon having standard 
books in new dress as upon having new books in the stacks; that 
plans to ‘“‘push books’’ would result in putting the best books in the 
hands of those who might not otherwise read them. The temper of 
the time toward the moving-picture and whatever is easy-going must 
be met by the librarian by plans for high endeavor. 
The seeretary’s report reviewed the work at headquarters office 
in Chicago. The membership was nearly 3,000; increased efforts for 
publicity had been made; addresses had been made at various State 
meetings and before library schools. The endowment funds of the 
association amount to about $108,000. The sale of publications 
issued by the association amounted to $11,560.79. 
Reports were presented by various committees: Administration, 
binding, work with the blind, cooperation with the National Educa- 
tion Association, coordination, public documents, library training, etc. 
The various sections conducted meetings at which different phases 
of Government service were prominent. 
The four affiliated organizations, the National Association of State 
Libraries, the American Association of Law Libraries, the League of 
Library Commissions, and the Special Libraries Association, held 
sessions also in Washington in conjunction with the meetings of the 
larger association. ; 
The officers elected for the coming year were: President, Hiller ©. 
Wellman, librarian of the Springfield (Mass.) City Library; first vice 
president, W. N. C. Carlton, librarian of the Newberry Library, Chi- 
cago; second vice president, Mary L. Titcomb, librarian of the 
Washington County Free Library, of Hagerstown, Md. 
The council expressed the appreciation of the association to the 
Postmaster General for the inclusion of books in the parcel post, 
with the hope that further facilities may be afforded as rapidly as 
experience and revenue justify, especially by the inclusion of all 
printed matter within the parcel post; by an arrangement for the 
collection of book parcels; by adoption of a fractional scale for 
quarter pounds above the initial pound; and by the ultimate estab- 
lishment of a rate not exceeding the old book rate of 8 cents a pound
-P-A-G-E-524

for the farther zones. The council also passed resolutions cordially 
approving the efforts which have been made toward the erection of 
a naticnal archive building. 
STATE LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. 
Thirty-nine States and the District of Columbia have some form 
of voluntary organization to which the principal libraries belong. 
These associations generally hold meetings yearly, sometimes more 
frequently, at which prearranged programs are carried out. A 
library association was formed in Wyoming in October, 1914, and 
the first meeting was held in Laramie. Plans for a State library 
commission are being prosecuted. Several State teachers” associa- 
tions have departments of libraries, among the number being Indiana, 
Maine, Michigan, and New York. 
The constitution of the American Library Association was revised 
in 1913 to permit any State library association to affiliate with the 
national body, and the following States have thus far availed them- 
selves of this opportunity: California, Colorado, District of Colum- 
bia, Iinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pacifie North- 
west (includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia), 
South Dakota, Tennessee. 
GIFTS. 
For the year 1913 the American Library Association reported! gifts 
to United States and Canadian libraries aggregating $4,428,241.68- 
Of this amount, $2,371,642 was received from the Carnegie Corpora- 
tion. In addition to money gifts, there were recorded 168,655 vol- 
umes, 12 sites for library buildings, 10 buildings presented for library 
purposes, and a number of miscellaneous items. 
AMERICAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE. 
The meeting of the American Library Institute for the year 1913- 
14 was held in New York City, December 1, 1913, with an attend- 
ance of over 100. It was full of interest and showed serious consid- 
eration of the problems discussed. 
Dr. W. Dawson Johnston, librarian of Columbia University, read 
a paper on ‘‘Recruiting college men and women for library work.” 
“Physical efficiency” was discussed by Dr. George J. Fisher, of 
New York City. ‘‘Book storage as affected by thickness of paper,” 
was presented by Dr. Harry L. Koopman, librarian of Brown Uni- 
versity, Providence, R. I. Melvil Dewey gave an address on ‘‘The 
library’s opportunity.”’ There was live discussion of all these papers.

LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1913-14, 489 
Dr. Paul Otlet, of the Institute of International Bibliography of 
Brussels, described a ‘‘roll book,” by which copies of certain parts 
of books could be thrown on a screen for use in schools, extension 
lectures, etc. 
Mr. Charles H. Gould, of McGill University, Montreal, presented 
the question of the standard of valuation for books that have been 
in the library for a long time, particularly periodicals that have 
become scarce in the market. The consensus of opinion in the meet- 
ing was that no standard of value could be set. 
PENSIONS. 
The city council of Omaha has approved an ordinance establishing 
a pension system for city library employees, who may be assessed 
not to exceed 14 per cent of their salary, to which the city is to add 
asum at least 14 times this amount. The fund may also be increased 
by private donations or bequests. Any employee who has been at 
work 35 years, 20 years of which have been in the Omaha Public 
Library, may be pensioned at the rate of $420 a year. Any person 
who has served 40 years, 20 of which have been in Omaha, shall be 
retired on a pension. 
A library pension law was recently before the Ohio Legislature, 
but did not pass, owing to the crowded condition of the calendar. 
The Brooklyn Public Library and the Boston Atheneum are con- 
sidering pension schemes. Pratt Institute Free Library, Buffalo 
Public Library, and Chicago Public Library already have pension 
systems. The Chicago plan was described by the librarian at the 
trustees’ section meeting of the American Library Association at 
Washington, in May, 1914.1. The Boston Public Library is propos- 
ing to establish a pension fund on the receipts from fines for overdue 
books, which amount to about $6,000 a year. 
WORK WITH FOREIGNERS. 
From 60 to 75 per cent of those who patronize our large city libra- 
ries are either foreign born or the children of foreign-born parents. 
Traveling libraries in nearly every European language are sent out 
by the leading library commissions, and foreign book lists have been 
compiled in most of these tongues. The Boston Public Library gave 
a series of free illustrated lectures in Italian. 
The work done for foreigners in our large city libraries is illustrated 
by the Cleveland (Ohio) Public Library, which has collections of 
books in Bohemian, Croatian, Danish and Norwegian, Finnish, 
French, German, Hebrew and Yiddish, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuan- 
ian, Polish, Roumanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, and

Swedish. The first Chinese library to be established in the United 
States has headquarters in Chicago. Many Chinese students are 
availing themselves of it. Buffalo has the largest Polish library in 
the country, containing about 15,000 volumes. 
In Massachusetts the work has been extended under the guidance 
of the new educational director of work with foreigners. Miss 
Campbell, the director, visited 25 libraries and spoke at six meetings 
in the furtherance of this work. Lists of books in 12 foreign languages 
were compiled. 
Buffalo, Springfield (Mass.), and other libraries report that this 
past year special attention has been given to this department of 
library work. Nearly all important public libraries have compiled 
reading lists of books in foreign languages, and are from time to time 
adding to their collection. ; 
LIBRARIES IN COMMERCIAL HOUSES. 
Business libraries in commercial houses have been growing in 
number and in activity during the past few years, until there are 
now hundreds of corporations, firms, and business men who maintain 
research and business libraries as regular departments of their plant. 
The following are a few of the fields covered by these “special libra- 
ries”: Accounting, architecture, chemistry, civics, commerce, elec- 
tricity, engineering, finance, gas, insurance, law, philanthropy, 
public service, railways, sanitation, social service, taxation, telephone, 
etc. A magazine, Special Libraries, is published in Indianapolis in 
the interests of these libraries and the work they are doing.t 
NEWER FORMS OF SERVICE. 
Public and university libraries and ibrary commissions, in increas- 
ing numbers, are lending both lantern slides and lanterns. The ex- 
tension division of the University of Minnesota has organized a free 
lantern-slide bureau. The extension division of the University of 
Wisconsin is taking steps to promote a library of educational films 
to lend to schools and social centers throughout the State. The 
new library building in Los Angeles, Cal., eontains a sound-proof 
music room, equipped with pianos, so that music may be tried by 
those who wish to hear it before purchasing. Many libraries loan 
music rolls, graphophone records, material for reflectoscopes, ete. 
The public libraries of St. Paul, Minn., and Wilmington, Del., 
have arranged with the Western Union Telegraph Co. for home de: 
livery of books, the charge of 5 cents a volume being borne by the 
borrower. Some libraries, St. Louis for example, have arranged for

local delivery of books by parcel post, the borrower paying the postage 
by a deposit made in advance. 
Allowing the public to charge and discharge their own books has 
been successfully tried in some of the small stations of the St. Louis 
Public Library. 
The publicity committee of the Kansas Library Association has 
been recently sending out to a select list of Kansas newspapers news 
letters containing items about the various libraries of the State. 
These news notes have been used by many of the papers and it is 
believed they have helped library progress in the State. Seattle, 
Grand Rapids, Jacksonville (Fla.), and other citiés send lists of 
books on the care and feeding of babies to all mothers whose names 
appear in the official register of births. 
NEW BUILDINGS. 
New library buildings have been erected at Bangor, Me.; Charleston, 
S. C.; Harrisburg, Pa.; Harvard University; Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity; Manchester, N. H.; Muskogee, Okla.; New Rochelle, N. Y.; 
Portland, Oreg.; Somerville, Mass.; Trinity College; Wichita, Kans.; 
and other places. 
EXPANSION IN LARGE CITIES.* 
Albany, N. Y. New York State Library.—tIn restocking the library, after the fire 
of 1911, $632,000 have been spent for books in the past three years, perhaps the largest 
sum ever spent by a single library in so short a time solely for books. At the request 
of the State prison reform commission the libraries in the prisons and reformatories 
of the State were inspected and a report presented. Among the recommendations 
were; Appointment of a State supervisor of prison and reformatory libraries, thorough 
reorganization of the libraries along lines outlined, closer censorship of novels and 
more careful book selection. The extension of the parcel post to books has appreciably 
increased opportunities for State-wide service. 
Birmingham, Ala—The public library was reorganized, several outlying libraries 
taken on as branches, and a director appointed over the entire system. A campaign 
for a book fund was conducted, and over $21,000 pledged; the income from the city 
was $12,000 and from other sources $11,340.57; and the circulation of books was 
179,434. 
Boston, Mass.—Two new branch buildings have been completed, one in the Charles- 
town district and one in East Boston, costing, respectively, $72,200 and $100,000, 
including land and fittings. Provision for two minor branches has been made in new 
municipal buildings, and two others (supplementing 15 already existing) have been 
established. The story hour for children has been strengthened and extended as an 
important part of the library work. It is not carried on for the amusement of the 
children merely, but is educational in its effect and leads to acquaintance with books 
and to their profitable use. Classes and study clubs, including nearly 1,500 students, 
have held regular meetings at the central library, and the university extension con- 
ferences, with special reserves of books, have included about 1,100 students. About 
70 free lectures were given at the central building, with continuous exhibitions of 
library and art material, at the central building and branches.

    492 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Brooklyn, N. ¥.—During 1913, 4,583,897 books were loaned; 301,100 people patron- 
ized the library out of a total population of 1,634,351; expenses for books, periodicals, 
and binding were $126,560. Several new branches have been opened. Following the 
practice of the New York Public Library the weekly hours of labor were reduced from 
42 to 40, and the result has been eminently satisfactory. The library is carrying on an 
investigation of conditions producing physical efficiency. A branch has been built 
and opened exclusively for children’s use. 
Buffalo, N. Y.—The public library’s appropriation was increased by $10,000, making 
a total of $115,000; the circulation was over a million and a halfof volumes; anew 
branch was opened in rented quarters, and special emphasis was laid on work with 
foreigners. 
Chicago. John Crerar Library.—The library now contains 322,049 volumes and some 
105,000 pamphlets, besides maps and plates. It receives currently 3,466 periodicals 
and 11,656 other serial publications. The total use during the year was about 522,000 
books and pamphlets, and the recorded attendence was 157,893. The expenses were 
$173,612.68. 
Chicago. Newberry Library.—The fourth publication of the library, issued in 1913, is 
entitled: ‘Descriptive account of the collection of Chinese, Tibetan, Mongol, and 
Japanese books in the Newberry Library. By Berthold Laufer.” 
Three exhibits of printed or manuscript material have been held: (a) English liter- 
ature and development of English printing; (6) Edward E. Ayer manuscripts relating 
to Indian wars and warfare, 1675-1869; (c) Autograph letters of over 100 English and 
American authors, lent by Mr. Hamlin Garland. ‘ 
The following classes and grades have been established in the library service: Heads 
of departments, senior assistants, junior assistants, pages. A club for recreation has 
been formed among members of the staff, and a tennis court, laid out on ground in rear 
of the library, is in frequent use by them outside of official hours. 
Chicago. Public Library.—During the year 7 new branches have been established, 
making 32 now maintained. A system of traveling libraries, supplanting the former 
delivery stations, has been organized for the remoter sections of the city, and 20 of these 
stations are now in operation, with collections of books varying from 500 to 1,500 in 
each, and supplemented with a daily parcel-post service for books not included in the 
local collection but obtainable from the central library. The school deposits have 
nearly doubled during the year, there being over 600 classroom libraries in constant 
use. The total number of books loaned for home use from the entire system for the past 
year was 3,428,638, a gain of 391,603 over the previous year. 
Cincinnati, Ohio.—One new branch was opened during the year. A course of 25 lec- 
tures was given for teachers, the lectures covering the technical use of the library, 
library methods, and children’s literature. The Cincinnati women’s club gave Christ- 
mas entertainments at 13 of the branches. More business men used the library than in 
any previous year. At the annual budget exhibit a room was assigned to the library, 
where reading lists and cards were distributed to many neple not acquainted with the 
library and its work. 
Cleveland, Ohio.—In 1913 the public library’s total expenditures were $480,924.92; 
2,668,430 volumes were issued for home reading, an average of 4.1 per capita, and 
152,762 borrowers’ cards were in force. The main library was removed to the fifth and 
sixth floors of an office building where it will probably remain until the erection of a 
new central building, for which a $2,000,000 bond issue has been approved by popular 
vote. The removal was accomplished without interrupting public service, 40,000 
volumes being transferred during one night. Two new branch buildings were opened. 
Denver, Colo.—An exhibition to call attention to Denver products and manufactures 
was shown in the library during the summer months. Six new deposits stations 
were opened, and the home circulation increased nearly 23 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-529
  LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1913-14. 493 
Detroit, Mich—Three new Carnegie branch libraries have been opened, making 11 
branches now in operation. Mr. Clarence M. Burton has presented to the public 
library a most valuable private library pertaining largely to the history of Michigan, 
together with the property in which it is housed. Although difficult to compute, its 
value commercially is probably a half million dollars. Plans are progressing for the 
new central library. 
Grand Rapids, Mich.—The renewal of books has been abolished, books (except new 
fiction) now being loaned for four weeks, instead of for two weeks. This has resulted 
in fewer people being compelled to pay fines and in more satisfactory relations between 
the library and the public. Employees are paid for Sunday and holiday time, instead 
of being granted time off on a week day. 
Harrisburg, Pa.—New library building was opened January 1, 1914, the gift by will 
of Mrs. Sarah J. Haldeman-Haly. The building is colonial in architecture and is 
located near the business center. The entire main floor has been thrown into one 
large room. 
Hartford, Conn.—The new building of the Connecticut State Library was turned 
over to the State officials on February 10, although it has been in use for the past three 
years. It cost $1,655,693, leaving a balance unexpended of $10,006. 
Los Angeles, Cal.—The main library was removed on June 1 to new quarters having 
50 per cent more floor space than in the former location. Art and industrial depart- 
ments have been organized. A new branch building, erected with funds given by the 
Carnegie Corporation, was opened February 27. Two other branch buildings are being 
planned. The total circulation of books was 1,559,359, a gain of 32 per cent over the 
preceding year. 
Louisville, Ky.—The public library opened two new branch buildings (one for the 
use of colored people), loaned 945,966 volumes for home use, an increase of 169,312 
. volumes, through 276 centers for the circulation of books, and answered 36,621 ques- 
tions in the reference departments. The library decided to loan books on all legal 
holidays except Christmas. 
Milwaukee, Wis.—Plans for the construction of a three-story addition to the public 
library, costing about $50,000, were approved July 8. The proposed addition will 
mean an increase in the capacity of the library of 200,000 volumes and provide two 
more public reading rooms. 
Morristown, N. J—The public library, located in a block of business buildings, was 
destroyed by fire February 23. The library was rich in New Jersey history. 
New Haven, Conn.—The Carnegie Corporation has offered $60,000 for the erection of 
three branch library buildings. Two branches are already in operation. 
New York, N. Y.—Five new Carnegie buildings were opened during the year, two 
of them replacing old branches in antiquated buildings. A municipal reference 
branch was opened in April in the new municipal building. A manuscripts division 
was established in September, 1914. In the circulation department, 8,824,289 books 
were borrowed for home use, an increase of nearly three-quarters of a million over the 
preceding year, and the largest annual circulation the library has ever had. In the 
reference department the number of readers and number of volumes consulted were 
fully 20 per cent greater than in the previous year. Cooperation with local educational, 
literary, and welfare societies has been strengthened through the growing use of the 
assembly and club rooms in branch buildings. 
Newark, N. J.—The business branch has been moved to a new building especially 
Poaeerncted for the purposes of the library. 
Oakland, Cal.—Four branch libraries are to be built from a $140,000 Carnegie dona- 
tion recently received. 
Philadelphia, Pa.—The total circulation for home use during the past year was 
2,296,368 volumes. ‘Two new branches were erected and three more are nearing 
completion. The apprentice class system installed last year has been successful.

    494 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Pittsburgh, Pa.—The Carnegie Library has over 400,000 -rolumes, from which nearly 
a million and a half loans were made for home use, an increase of 101,691 over the 
preceding year. The lecture rooms had a wider use than in previous years. Regular 
series of lectures were planned for some of the branches on economic subjects, such as; 
Some phases of the labor problem; The rise of society; Philosophy of Henry George; 
Modern social movements, etc. Prominent speakers donated their services. 
Portland, Oreg.—The new central library, costing $485,000, on a site valued at 
$375,000, was opened September 8, 1913. Two new branches were also opened, and. 
a technical department was organized. The library provides frequent lectures and 
has rooms for meetings of societies, committees, etc. In the past eight months these 
lectures have been attended by about 75,000 persons. The tax levy was increased. 
in November from four-tenths to forty-five one-hundredths of 1 mill. During the 
year 1,158,900 volumes were loaned for home use. 
St. Louis, Mo.—The public library circulated during the year 1,535,170 volumes, 
an increase of 121,353; its registered users number 95,351, an increase of 2,044; the 
staff numbers 94 men and 148 women; total of 242. The expenses for maintenance 
amounted to $224,094.57. One thousand Ietters were sent out to ascertain why card 
holders fail to reregister. Only 108 replied; 25 had removed from the city, 14 said the 
location was inconvenient, 10 reported failure to get desired books, 39 pleaded lack 
of time, etc. None found fault with the attitude of the staff. A number of “‘ Visitors’ 
nights” were held, when the library was thrown open to sightseers, and guides were 
furnished for their assistance. 
San Francisco, Cal—A chain of branch libraries to aggregate in value $375,000 has 
been commenced, as well as the main library building, which will, with the land, 
be valued at $2,000,000, and will occupy a site in the new civic center. There are 
now 15 deposit stations and 6 branch libraries; 934,000 books were loaned for home 
use, an increase of 84,000 over last year. There are 44,376 card holders. Much atten- 
tion has been given to the development of the music section. 
Seattle, Wash.—A new branch, costing $35,000, the fifth building given by Mr. 
Carnegie, was opened New Year’s Day. The appropriation was increased from 
$158,807.43 to $168,185.40; 1,041,002 volumes were loaned from 496 distributing 
agencies; 55,203 residents are enrolled as borrowers; an intermediate collection of 
books has been installed in the central building for children in the eighth grade and 
above; and more was done on library publicity than in any previous year. 
Spokane, Wash.—The Carnegie Corporation has given $70,000 for four new branches. 
Springfield, Mass —Special efforts were made to reach the foreign population, re- 
sulting in an increase of 27 per cent in the circulation of foreign books. The total 
number of distributing agencies increased from 334 to 363. A new branch library 
building was completed and opened. The appropriation was increased from $55,000 
to $60,000. 
Washington, D. C.—The public library utilized 136 agencies last year for the distri- 
bution of books. The home circulation was 713,634 volumes. Much work is done 
with the schools, A bill is pending in Congress, the passage of which will greatly 
increase the use of the free public library to the people. This provides that school 
buildings may be used as social centers, centers of recreation, and for free public- 
library branches during vacation as well as during the school year. 
Worcester, Mass.—Three Carnegie branches were opened in February.

INTRODUCTION. 
The report of the Commissioner of Education for 1913 included a 
chapter on the educational work of American museums.' As this 
was intended to be the first of a series of annual reviews, the subject 
was approached from the historical and statistical side. It was 
shown that those museums that derive their financial support to a 
large extent from municipal appropriation have been the leaders in 
developing educational work, although they comprise but 15 per 
cent of all the museums of the United States. Leadership in this 
direction is the natural effect of the obligation to serve the general 
public imposed by receipt of tax funds. So successful and important 
have these educational activities become that they are now essential 
functions of the public museum, and are undertaken more and more 
extensively by privately endowed museums. 
Few of the museums supported by colleges or by societies and asso- 
ciations as an incidental feature of their work are participating in 
this great development. This condition is due in part to lack of 
funds, and in part to ineffective organization, as was pointed out in 
this report last year. It is a great misfortune that nearly 75 per cent 
of all museums in the United States belong to this group, but the 
phenomenal success and expansion of those museums that are able 
to develop their educational possibilities leads to the hope that the 
leaven may in some way spread through the whole lump. 
It is the purpose of this and subsequent reports to describe recent 
developments in the educational work of museums, and to record 
the extent to which the various methods are employed. The author

has been aided in the preparation of this chapter by 70 museums, 
which have supplied information regarding their educational activi- 
ties, and by Mr. Henry W. Kent, secretary of the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York, who has kindly given the use of special 
information obtained from 30 museums of art. 
MUSEUMS ESSENTIALLY EDUCATIONAL. 
That museums have not been more generally recognized as essen- 
tially educational institutions is due to the fact that they have existed 
in the past too largely for the benefit of limited and favored classes— 
art museums for artists and wealthy patrons of art; natural-history 
museums for specialists in narrow systematic fields. 
In order to make museums of broad educational value it is neces- 
sary not merely to install the exhibits in a manner intelligible to the 
general public, but to make access easy, and to advertise. It is no 
more reasonable to expect ideas to find their way unaided to the 
masses of the people than to expect goods to sell themselves. No 
museum fulfills its educational function by merely maintaining its 
exhibition collections, however well they may be installed. It must 
carry its wares to the people, if it would reach more than a small per- 
centage of them. It is true that traveling exhibits and lectures out- 
side the museum are merely samples of what the museum can do 
better within the walls of its rich storehouse, and the public should 
be led to appreciate that ‘‘extension work” is but an indication of 
the welcome, pleasure, and instruction to be found in visiting the 
museum. It will always be possible, however, to reach more people 
with extension work than can be brought into the museum as regular 
visitors. Thus personal contact will replace the former aloofness of 
the museum, and its influence will become a factor in the lives of 
thousands to whom it must otherwise remain a stranger, while many 
will profit even more abundantly by becoming regular visitors. 
It is gratifying to find that many museums stress the educational 
value of their exhibits, but still more gratifying to find that many are 
making it their business to carry the museum to the people whenever 
necessary. 
AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENT. 
One of the most interesting features of the educational work of 
museums during the past year is a concerted experiment in the use 
of museum objects in teaching the history of civilization, participated 
in by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the 
Children’s Museum in Brooklyn, the Children’s Museum in Boston, 
and the Worcester Art Museum. 
This experiment is the result of a series of very interesting efforts 
to utilize museum material more effectively in education. The move-
-P-A-G-E-535
  
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 499 
ment began in 1900 when a meeting arranged by Miss A. B. Thompson 
and a few others was held at the rooms of the Twentieth Century 
Club in Boston to consider ways and means by which teachers might 
be enabled to study the abundant material in museums and thereby 
enrich their teaching. At this meeting a petition to the Museum of 
Fine Arts in Boston was drawn up reciting that archeology and the 
history of art are in themselves important subjects and are important 
departments of history; that they elucidate and illustrate text and 
reinforce the teaching of literature; that college entrance require- 
ments specify that Greek and Roman history are to be taught with 
““due reference to art;’”’ that medieval and modern history are equally 
capable of enrichment through due recognition of the works of art 
their epochs have produced; and that no adequate courses of instruc- 
tion in these subjects are now open to teachers. In view of these 
facts, the museum was petitioned (1) to lead the way in outlining a 
general course of study on these subjects illustrative of the develop- 
ment of European and American civilizations, and (2) to allow teach- 
ers to form themselves into classes for the purpose of pursuing courses 
of study in the museum under teachers selected by the museum. 
The petition was favorably received by the Museum of Fine Arts, 
and from 1901 to 1904 ten courses of from 10 to 15 lectures each were 
given on Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek, and Roman art; Greck vases; 
Renaissance sculpture; and Renaissance and pre-Renaissance paint- 
ings. The classes of teachers attending these courses were organized 
by a committee consisting of Miss A. B. Thompson, Miss L. W. Case, 
Miss E. de C. Heath, and Miss A. D. Slocum.! 
In 1904 the organization of teachers’ classes was transferred from 
this committee to Simmons College, which cooperated with the 
museum in this work from 1904 until 1907.2 In November, 1907, 
the Museum of Fine Arts took over the entire management of this 
work, with the assistance of an advisory committee on education 
appointed by the trustees of the museum.* 
Miss Anna D. Slocum was a member of the Woman’s Education 
Association of Boston, as well as of the advisory committee on edu- 
cation, and, having conceived plans that she considered too new and 
too untried to bring before the advisory committee, submitted them 
to the Woman’s Education Association. They were received with 
approval, and in March, 1911, the association authorized its standing 
committee on public schools to undertake their development. This 
committee ultimately placed a subcommittee in charge of the work.

  500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The subcommittee reported at the end of the year‘ that at its 
request a course of eight lectures on textiles had been given in the 
textile study room of the Museum of Fine Arts for the benefit of 
teachers from the Girls’ High School of Practical Arts, the Trade 
School for Girls, and instructors from Simmons College. This course 
was given by Miss Flint, and considered (1) tapestry weaving, (2) 
rugs, (3) shuttle weaving to the fifteenth century, (4) shuttle weaving 
from the beginning of the fifteenth century to the introduction of 
power machinery, (5) point lace, (6) bobbin lace, (7) embroideries, 
(8) printed materials. 
A second course of four lectures in Egyptian, Greek, and Japanese 
costumes was also successfully conducted, while under the auspices 
of the subcommittee Mr. Louis Earle Rowe, of the Museum of Fine 
Arts, lectured at the summer session of the State Normal School at 
Hyannis on the museum of fine arts as an aid to the school-teacher. 
_In continuing the plans of Miss Slocum the subcommittee of the 
Woman’s Education Association invited the cooperation of the 
American Museum of Natural History, the Children’s Museum of 
Brooklyn, and the Children’s Museum of Boston in carrying on the 
concerted experiment which is the immediate subject of this report. 
Miss Slocum, as a member of the American Association of Museums, 
arranged for the results of this experiment to be presented in the 
form of papers at the meeting of the association in May, 1914. Before 
this experiment was concluded Miss Slocum learned of the lectures 
being given by the Worcester Art Museum and secured a report on 
its work for presentation with the other reports at the meeting of the 
American Association of Museums. 
lt will be noted that up to this point this movement had been 
concerned solely with the utilization of material in museums of fine 
art. Miss Slocum considers that the plan of starting the course in the 
developmeni of civilization still further back, with illustrations of 
primitive life, is the especial contribution of Mrs. Agnes L. Vaughan, 
and that her work as assistant in the department of public education 
places the American Museum of Natural History in the lead in this 
movement among museums of science. 
It is to be regretted that space forbids a full presentation of the 
work done during the past year by the several museums which 
cooperated in the experiment reported upon in full at the 1914 meet- 
ing of the American Association of Museums.? The essential idea 
underlying this experiment is the feeling that children in the ele- 
mentary grades need to appreciate more fully the early beginnings 
of civilization and their relation to modern conditions. In developing 
this idea the American Museum of Natural History in New York

-P-A-G-E-537
  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 501 
laid out definite work involving a study of the implements and 
utensils of primitive peoples, and tracing in a broad way the develop- 
ment of modern civilization from these humble beginnings. An 
effort was made to bring children to an appreciation of the material 
life (food, housing, clothing, means of existence), psychic life (games, 
recreation, fine arts, religion, myths, science), and social life (home 
life, war and commerce, social organizations, international organi- 
zation) of primitive peoples. 
The Children’s Museum of Brooklyn began with the geology of 
Long Island as showing how the land was prepared for the people, 
and passed to a consideration of the early peoples, savage and civil- 
ized, who occupied the island in the early periods of history, leading 
up in this way to the Dutch rule, British rule, the Revolution, etc. 
The Worcester Art Museum endeavored especially to acquaint the 
children with buildings of different countries and periods by present- 
ing them as expressions of the life and circumstances of the people, 
and to arouse interest in the buildings of Worcester by showing the 
traditions under which they were produced. 
Story-telling was one of the chief methods of presentation adopted 
by all the museums. These papers aroused intense interest among 
museum workers and will probably lead to more extensive experi- 
ments during the coming year. 
EXTENSION WORK OF ART MUSEUMS. 
Museums of art are growing rapidly in appreciation of the impor- 
tance of entering more intimately into the life of the people. This 
is well illustrated by the increased use of docents—members of the 
staff assigned to act as guides and instructors in the galleries. Docent 
service was introduced at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in 1907, 
and is now widely used in art museums. 
Other methods of giving instruction in art to the general public 
and to schools are coming into prominence in all the more active 
art museums and indicate a radical change in the conception of the 
functions of the museum. These new ideas are expressed in many 
of the activities of the older art museums, but are especially con- 
spicuous in some of the newer museums, whose organization is 
naturally more plastic. 
The history and present work of the Toledo Museum of Art afford 
one of the best illustrations of the value of close relations between 
the museum and the people. Organized only 10 years ago by 120 
men who each subscribed $10 annually, the museum made up for 
what it lacked in collections by the intimate way in which it culti- 
vated the interest of the people. To this policy must be attributed 
in large measure its flourishing condition at the end of the first decade. 
It now occupies a beautiful building in the heart of the residential

502 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
part of Toledo. The building and grounds represent an expenditure 
of $400,000, one-half of which was the gift of the president, Mr. 
Edward Drummond Libbey; the other half was raised by popular 
subscription in sums ranging from 10 cents to $15,000. All classes 
of citizens contributed—merchants, bankers, school children, mem- 
} bers of women’s clubs, artists, students, and the men and women of the 
factories. 
The support which the people have given to this museum seems 
adequately explained by the summary of its educational work as 
reported by the director, Mr. George W. Stevens: 
Noon hour talks on art and travel in the factories. 
Illustrated evening talks in public school buildings for neighborhood parents. 
Annual exhibits of the art and manual training work of the pupils of the public 
schools, to which pupils and their parents are invited free. 
Free Saturday classes in drawing for children. 
Free Saturday classes in drawing for teachers of the public schools who wish to be- 
come more proficient. 
Weekly criticism of the prints of amateur photographers for the purpose of teaching 
them composition. Paintings in the museum used as illustrations. 
Weekly art history study clubs conducted in connection with the Federation of 
Women’s Clubs. 
Weekly art history study classes made up of society debutantes. 
Monthly art history study classes made up of factory girls. 
_ Monthly evening receptions at the museum for working girls and their escorts. 
Light refreshments sometimes served and a musical program occasionally introduced. 
Special nights and talks for colored people. 
Daily talks in the galleries on various subjects to groups of school children. 
A Toledo Collector’s League made up of small boys collecting anything, who meet 
at the museum four times a month for exchange of specimens, study, and amusement. 
Evening life classes during the winter months. 
Band and orchestral concerts in the museum and on the museum grounds. 
The maintenance of a public information and research bureau giving assistance to 
school children and club women in the preparation of papers on art, etc. 
Sunday afternoon talks to the general public in the galleries on the paintings hang- 
ing at the time. 
Special evenings and talks for employees of department stores, etc. 
Many of our activities are varied and changeable, each day bringing its new sug- 
gestions and necessities. We aim to keep the museum beating in unison with the 
pulse of the community. If we note in the morning paper that a convention is to be 
held in the city, we invite the delegates to the museum and arrange for their trans- 
portation. We cooperate with the chamber of commerce, churches, schools, and 
manufacturers. During the year 1913-14 there were three special educational activi- 
ties of more than usual importance, as fellows: 
First. A City-Beautiful Campaign, instructing all citizens and school children 
how to beautify their dwellings, vacant lots, etc., by means of uP landscape 
gardening. Thirty thousand people heard lectures. Fifty thousand booklets were 
distributed. Two hundred and Lity-fve cash prizes were awarded. Two hundred 
thousand packages of seeds were sold. 
Second. A Child Welfare Exhibit attended by 50,000 visitors. Fifteen galleries 
devoted to exhibits illustrating in many ways the activities of the child and suggesting 
hundreds of improvements in the conditions surrounding the children of the city. Third. A movement for the preservation and protection of desirable birds. Ilus- 
trated lectures given. Bird bees constructed by the manual training pupils.

Arrangements for a bird-day celebration when thousands of bird houses will be prop- 
as Toeated. Plans for feeding birds during the winter, the building of bird shel- 
The scope of this work extends far beyond the general conception 
of an art museum and approaches closely what the museum of the 
future may be expected to be—a center of many community activi- 
ties, closely coordinated with the life of the people and with every 
organization related in purpose to the field of the museum. 
The history of the Toledo Museum is a most conspicuous illustra- 
tion of the ready response which the people will make to advances 
from the museums. In few instances have these advances been made 
so earnestly, but where they have the response has been as ready in 
proportion to the resources of the community. 
Even museum workers are slow in realizing that the policies and 
methods of all museums should be fundamentally identical, whether 
the material treated belong to the field of art or history or science. 
Tn the smaller communities one institution must include all; in larger 
communities each subject will have its separate museum, but when 
each of these museums works in harmony with the others for the 
common purpose of serving the people, museums will occupy a much 
larger place in the estimation of the public, and will inevitably receive 
municipal support in increasing measure. 
Dependence upon tax appropriations and private contributions 
has been the most potent factor in the revivification of museums, 
and will continue to mold their policy to the benefit of both the public 
and the museums. 
BRANCH MUSEUMS. 
The difficulty, danger, and expense of bringing large numbers of 
children frequently to the museums in cities led to the adoption of 
such forms of museum extension as traveling exhibits and lectures 
outside the museum. ‘The problem now pressing for solution is that 
of providing branch museums or centers of museum extension work. 
Miss Anna B. Gallup, curator of the Children’s Museum of Brook- 
lyn, referring to the length of time that would be required for the 
school children of Brooklyn even to walk in procession through the 
museum, suggested the necessity of taking the material to the children 
in their local centers.!. The Commercial Museum, in Philadelphia, has 
already established the first of eight or ten such centers, some of them 
15 miles apart. It was at first proposed that the lectures should be in 
charge of teachers assigned from the schools, but the museum was 
unwilling te undertake the work unless it could have the lecturers 
entirely under its control and keep them under instruction in the 
museum a part of the time. This was finally conceded. The   
1 Proc. Am, Assoc. Mus, VIII, 1914, p. 54.  
-P-A-G-E-540
    504 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
museum provides a moving-picture outfit, lantern, slides, and material 
to illustrate the lectures, and has full control.t 
The American Museum of Natural History, in New York, an- 
nounced ? in June, 1914, that final plans for opening 10 local lécture 
centers had been submitted to the trustees and to the board of 
education. The lectures will be delivered by the museum staff of 
18 lecturers and will be mainly on geographical, historical, and in- 
dustrial subjects. A system of lending lantern slides for use in 
classrooms will be established, and a branch museum in the Washing- 
ton Irving High School will be a local museum for the lower east side 
of the city. 
These large extensions of the educational services of museums 
indicate the importance and the progressive spirit of their coopera- 
tion with the schools. 
ENDOWMENTS FOR EDUCATIONAL WORK. 
The Field Museum of Natural History, in Chicago, has established 
a special educational department for cooperation with the public 
schools. This action was made possible by an endowment of $250,000 
given by Mr. Norman W. Harris in December, 1911. The income 
from this endowment is to be used to maintain a system of museum 
extension to the public schools of Chicago.* 
Since this is apparently the first endowment for general educational 
work with schools, it is interesting to note the purpose of Mr. Harris, 
as stated by Mr. 5S. C. Simms, curator of the N. W. Harris Public 
School Extension: 
Mr. Harris has a deeper purpose even than the education of the young in natural . 
science. He believes that if a scheme can be devised, and this is suggested as one, 
whereby the textbooks may be given life, may be vitalized, and the younger minds 
of society given attractive fields in which to extend their imaginative and reasoning 
faculties, better citizenship will develop in the community, and more stable civic 
conditions be promised. 
To certain children study is drudgery and school work toil, and they grow up in 
opposition to established rules and a compliance with them. This attitude of habitual 
disagreement takes different and often dangerous forms as the child matures, and we 
have then an enemy of society as an organization. Mr. Harris believes that a mind 
interested is a mind tranquil, and that the habit of acquiring knowledge is like any 
other habit. If this habit can be made attractive and pleasing at first, it is more apt 
to continue. 
This new department has already begun actual work in a limited 
way. Two hundred cases of zoological, geological, and botanical 
material are in circulation. The bird cases contain male and female, 
nest with eggs or young or both, and sometimes an economic feature

in the way of food materials. Popular labels of 250 to 300 words 
are used. Delivery to the schools is made by automobile. 
It is to be hoped that the example of Mr. Harris will be followed 
by others and thus lead to a new epoch in the educational work of 
museums. 
MUSEUM EXTENSION IN PENNSYLVANIA. 
The Commercial Museum, in Philadelphia, occupies in several 
respects a unique position. It includes museum collections illus- 
trating the products and peoples of the world, amplified by free 
lectures and educational work in the museum, and by loan lectures 
and miniature museums distributed throughout the State of Penn- 
sylvania. It conducts a foreign trade bureau for the development 
of the international commerce of the United States. The corres- 
pondents of this bureau throughout the world enable the museum to 
acquire information and material of unusual value in commerce and 
industry. The nature and scope of the museum is thus unique. It 
is also unique in that it receives appropriations from both the city 
council and the State legislature. 
The extent of the educational work of this museum throughout 
Pennsylvania and the conditions under which it has developed 
can not be better told than in the words of the director, Dr. W. P. 
Wilson, whose broad vision and indomitable energy have made the 
work possible. He says: 
The Commercial Museum began 10 years or more ago to try to reach the children 
of Philadelphia. It first prepared a collection of about 400 objects and 100 photo- 
graphs to illustrate basic materials in commerce. These things were packed in a big 
box in such a way that any teacher could repack them. This box was sent out as an 
” experiment to one of theschools. The intention was to leave it there 10 days and then 
have the wagon take it on to the next school. We had arranged a series of schools to 
which it should go, but when we called for the collection the school did not want to 
let it go, and we very soon found that we could not take these collections away after 
10 days without ill feeling. We decided that the plan was not practical and gave it 
up after a few exhibits had been prepared. 
Later we.prepared collections which we put into the schools and left there per- 
manently. We were so poor in the beginning that we solicited gifts of manufacturing 
materials from various firms in order to make these exhibits. Finally, we got an 
appropriation of $30,000 to put these collections in the schools throughout the State 
during the next two years. We give them to the schools with all necessary informa- 
tion and instructions. Many of them go into the little country districts, where the 
schools are not graded at all; in fact, we try to get them into these schools in preference 
to any others. 
The work has gone along in this way until we estimate that we are reaching about 
75,000 children in the State each year in one way or another. In addition to these 
collections, we have another systematic work which consists in sending lectures with 
lantern slides and lanterns to the different schools. 
We went a step further. We procured lanterns that in the first instance were run 
with kerosene, because they went into little remote schools where the teacher prob- 
  
1 Proc, Am, Assoc. Mus., VII, 1914, pp. 55-56.  
-P-A-G-E-542
  
  506 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
ably had never seen a lantern. Everyone is used to handling kerosene lamps, and we 
knew that the teacher would know how to trim a lantern which burned kerosene oil, 
Later we found that electricity had so developed that there were electric plants in 
some small towns of only three or four or five hundred people; so we added both incan- 
descent and arc lanterns. To-day we are using for the remote schools acetylene 
lights, which come with the compressed gas in alittle tank that isso simple that a child 
can handle it. Kerosene has been done away with. At present we are circulating 
continually 15 lanterns and 30 cases, keeping two or three people busy in taking care 
of them. 
In addition to writing new lectures on all kinds of subjects, we so adjust this matter 
that some person who is a little ahead of the others‘in a given township will arrange 
that one lantern will go into 5 or 8 or sometimes 10 schools, and yet be back to us in 
15 days. Weare also letting the churches have these lanterns. 
ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONS WITH SCHOOLS. 
It is remarkable that the services of museums have been but 
tardily recognized by school authorities, although the high value of 
these services is now generally appreciated by leading educators. 
That better administrative relations in this respect will come soon 
and rapidly seems assured. The extension centers of the Commercial 
Museum in Philadelphia, already mentioned, are the result of the 
investigation of a committee appointed by the district superintend- 
ents to examine into the work that the museum has been, doing with 
the schools for 10 years without official recognition. The report of 
the committee led to a formal request from the superintendent of 
schools for affiliation. 
MUSEUM WORK FOR THE BLIND. 
An interesting extension of museum work for the benefit of the 
blind is being successfully developed at the American Museum of 
Natural History in New York. This was begun in an experimental 
way in 1909. In 1910 it was placed on a permanent basis through a 
bequest from Phebe Anna Thorne, known as the Jonathan Thorne 
Memorial. The income from this endowment enables the museum to 
send loan collections to schools for the blind in the vicinity of New 
York, to give illustrated lectures in the museums to blind children 
and adults, and to supply transportation for the blind and their 
guides to and from the museum. 
During the past year plans for thorough organization of this work 
have matured, and it now occupies a prominent place in the annual 
educational program. A census of all the blind in and near New 
York City has been prepared with the assistance of the New York 
Association for the Blind and the New Jersey State Commission. 
Cards were sent to every blind person for return of information relating 
to occupation and hours of work, whether the person is able to attend

afternoon or evening lectures, ability to secure a guide, and topics 
that would be of especial interest. This registration enables the 
museum to communicate directly with the blind people and to afford 
them the facilities most useful to them. 
The objects lent to the schools for the blind include the regular 
school collections and ethnographical specimens selected according 
to the requests of the teachers. Indian or Eskimo clothing, imple- 
ments, and toys arouse such interest that several of the children have 
written letters to the museum during the school year to express their 
pleasure in the collections. The material is selected, outside of its 
interest value, with regard to form, use, and durability under use, 
although the care exercised by the teachers is found effective in keep- 
ing the exhibits intact. The children are permitted to handle the 
specimens and thus to gain sense impressions and ideas that would 
otherwise be impossible to them. 
Visits to the museum are also recognized as a part of the work of 
the schools for the blind and are made during school hours. The 
significance of these visits is summarized by Mr. George H. Sherwood, 
curator of public instruction, thus:+ 
The visit to the museum means more than an hour’s instruction, more than a mere 
viewing of new objects; it meansa change of environment, astimulation of intellectual 
expression, the appreciation of the socializing forces which go to produce public insti- 
tutions for the distribution of knowledge and the betterment of life. * * * Prob- 
ably no audience at the museum ever had greater enjoyment than did the 300 blind 
who assembled last autumn to hear Rear Admiral Peary tell the story of the discovery 
of the pole. The pleasure of the guests was increased by the special exhibit of the 
polar animals and the sledge actually used by Peary in his memorable trip. 
UNIVERSITY MUSEUMS OF CULTURE. 
In the chapter on the educational work of museums last year, it 
was pointed out that the museums of schools, colleges, and universi- 
ties are numerically the largest class in the country, constituting 
approximately 38 per cent of all museums, but that they receive less 
financial support and accomplish less work than any others, with the 
possible exception of the smaller historical museums. The causes 
of this unfortunate condition of college museums as a class were also 
discussed, and a few exceptions to the general rule were noted. 
Under these conditions, the action of the board of trustées of the 
University of Indiana in authorizing, in 1911, the establishment of a 
museum of classical archeology and art, and a museum of European 
culture, is of especial interest.? 
Mr. Neil C. Brooks, curator of the Museum of European Culture, | 
points out that the museum of culture is a type comparatively new |

    508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
among university museums, and that the three newest museums at 
Harvard—the Semitic, the Germanic, and the Social museums—are 
of this type and have all been established within the last 10 or 11 
years. It is the purpose of these museums to illustrate important 
periods and phases of civilization and of social development, and it 
is significant that they are established to serve as an educational aid 
to the departments of history and the social sciences, languages, and 
literature—just those departments which until recently were thought 
to need no material equipment except books and perhaps a few maps. 
Mr. Brooks believes that teachers of the humanities should realize 
more than they do that museum material is as essential to the study 
of history or literature or art as a laboratory is to the study of physics 
or chemistry. 
It is to be hoped that these new university museums will success- 
fully perform a large educational function and receive better-sus- 
tained support than the many college museums of natural history 
that have been created by enthusiastic and devoted labor only to be 
superseded by laboratories and changing ideas. The condition of 
these museums is the more pitiful because their decline is coincident 
with the recognition of the educational value of public museums. 
CHILDREN’S MUSEUMS. 
The Children’s Museum of Boston, the establishment of which was 
noted in this report last year, is proving a worthy companion of the 
Children’s Museum in Brooklyn, which was the pioneer in this field. 
The development of this museum has been so rapid and its success so 
marked that the report of the director, Miss Delia I. Griffin, is quoted 
in full: 
This museum was established in response to the desire of a group of teachers for 
some adequate assistance in presenting the subject of nature study to their classes. 
Through the efforts of these teachers, wealthy and philanthropic citizens were inter- 
ested in the project as well as the large museums of Massachusetts and the Park depart- 
ment of the city. 
As a result of the combined efforts of these agencies, the museum was opened to 
the public August 1, 1913. Itis housed in ‘Pine Bank,’’ a fine brick building situ- 
ated on the shore of Jamaica Pond, within walking distance of the Zoological Garden 
and Arnold Arboretum and in the midst of Boston’s park system. The department 
not only allows the use of the building and pays for its maintenance, but cooperates 
with the museum in many ways, supplying material for botanical exhibits and afford- 
ing facilities for nature walks and excursions. 
All the collections are gifts from other museums, from business firms, and from 
individuals. They consist of fairly representative exhibits illustrating various depart- 
ments of natural history, ethnology, and industry. But aside from these there are 
special exhibits valuable in a children’s museum although not, perhaps, of a nature 
to be acceptable to a large scientific institution, temporary displays of bird pictures, 
nest boxes, feeding stations, and different kinds of bird food; aquaria and vivaria filled 
with reptiles and insects in various stages of development; and the flower tables with

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 509 
their procession of blossoms, both wild and cultivated, in the spring and summer, 
and their burden of fruits and twigs of trees during the fall and winter. 
In the eight school months of last year 300 lectures were given. Some of these 
assumed the form of walks through the park, with study of birds, shrubs, or trees; 
others were concerned with description of the exhibits, but the greater number were 
formal illustrated talks given in the lecture room and attended by classes of school 
children. Itis a pleasure to record that the superintendent and. most of the masters 
give heartiest sanction to the plan of such visits during school hours. The wishes of 
the teachers are followed in regard to the subjects of these lectures, which are corre- 
lated with the course of study in nature, geography, and history. 
In addition to the educational work carried on by the members of the staff, the 
museum has been most fortunate in having the assistance of scientists and lecturers 
of note. Mr. J. H. Emerton, the well-known authority on spiders, gave a series of a 
dozen lectures illustrated by his own collection and by drawings. The lectures were 
so popular that Mr. Emerton is to repeat them this year. A geologist from the Uni- 
versity Museum at Harvard took a group of boys on Saturday tramps during the spring, 
each pupil being provided with hammer, chisel, and ‘‘Geological Primer,” and these 
trips are to be continued the coming year. 
The stories of child life in Japan, written by Mr. Tomita, of the Museum of Fine 
Arts, are a notable addition to this educational work and are designed to accompany 
the Japanese collection, which is one of the most complete features of the history 
room. These stories have been exceedingly popular with groups of children from set- 
tlement houses, who have visited the museum during the summer. 
The courtesy of these gentlemen and of several others, all of whom gave their serv- 
ices, enabled the museum to provide for the young people speakers of unusual ability 
and also to furnish the scientists with eager and stimulating audiences. 
The institution is incorporated, the board of trustees containing representatives of 
the State and city boards of education, the teaching force and park department of 
Boston, in addition to persons of leisure who have time to devote to the details of 
developing the museum. Its support is derived from membership dues, and a plan 
is now under way for securing an endowment fund. 
Tn the final analysis, the value of such an institution must be determined by the 
attitude of the child public toward it. This one has been adopted by the juvenile 
population of Boston. The average daily attendance is upwards of 200, that of Satur- 
day afternoons from 500 to 1,000. Dozens of young people plan to inspect it weekly, 
bringing contributions to it and noticing all new installations, while a few evidently 
consider that day lost which does not allow them an hour or more ‘“‘helping” to arrange 
flower tables, feed the turtles, and act as guides for visitors. It was one of these lads 
who responded to the question, ‘‘How long does it take you to walk over here from 
your home??? with “Oh, I don’t walk, I run all the way!” 
It may confidently be expected that the number of children’s 
museums will increase in the near future, and that corresponding 
success will be attained in many parts of the country. 
SPECIAL MUSEUMS. 
While the essentially public museums are the most conspicuously 
successful in educational work, it must not be overlooked that there 
are a considerable number of museums devoted to special technical 
subjects, like medicine, usually not open to the public, and having 
no elaborate organization, but containing much valuable material 
which is abundantly utilized in technical education and research.

  510 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The importance of visual instruction as expressed in museum ex- 
hibitions has been recognized in several special educational move- 
ments. The central feature of the highly organized antituberculosis 
campaign was a traveling museum, which was shown first at the 
American Museum of Natural History and subsequently in many 
cities throughout the country. A more recent illustration is the 
special exhibition conducted within the past year by the Museum of 
Safety in New York. These exhibitions are of a nature intermediate 
between the permanent museum and the temporary exposition: In 
their transient feature they resemble the latter, but their definiteness 
of purpose, discriminating selection of material, and instructiveness 
of labeling partake more of the nature of the museum. 
The educational value of some of these exhibitions has been very 
great, and has demonstrated the desirability of reorganization into 
permanent museums. Thus the desirability of permanent civic and 
social museums has been shown by the many successful exhibits deal- 
ing with municipal government, hygiene, industrial problems, civic 
betterment, etc. Museums of this character were discussed in a 
comprehensive paper read before the Milwaukee-Chicago convention 
of the American Association of Museums by Mr. Edward L. Bur- 
chard, of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy.t The 
chief function of such museums would be the education of the rising 
generation. 
VOCATIONAL LABORATORIES. 
Dr. Hector Alliot, curator of the Southwest Museum, at Los 
Angeles, reports that he is installing in the new building of the mu- 
seum free voluntary vocational laboratories for children over 14 years 
old, and for all others of mature years desirous of studying ethnology, 
zoology, conchology, entomology, botany, mineralogy, and tech- 
nology. 
This is but another illustration of the broad conception some of the 
newer museums have of their function, Such experiments will be 
watched with interest. 
CONCLUSION. 
The educational function of museums, both within the buildings 
and in various forms of extension work, is developing with marked 
enthusiasm by museum workers and is attracting increased interest 
and cooperation from school officials and the general public. The 
past year has seen concerted action by a number of museums for the 
more effective educational use of their material. It has been marked 
by the organization of the N. W. Harris Public School Extension at 
the Field Museum of Natural History in Clitcago, by a remarkably

rapid development of the Children’s Museum in Boston, and by the 
completion of the $400,000 new building of the Toledo Museum of 
Art as the crowning achievement of a brief. 10 years of growth. It 
has emphasized the value of museums of culture in university in- 
struction, and it has seen museum extension work more thoroughly 
and effectively organized than ever before. The increasing educa- 
tional work of art museums is especially interesting. 
For a proper appreciation of the present status of American 
museums in educational work, it must be remembered that the great 
bulk of this work is accomplished by museums receiving their mainte- 
nance chiefly from city governments and from private contributions. 
In other words, the most significant educational work is accom- 
plished by approximately one-quarter of the museums of the country, 
while fully half of the museums are in an inactive or moribund state. 
It is important to determine whether the inevitable development of 
the educational function of museums will be accomplished by the 
reorganization and revivification of these inactive museums cr wheth- 
er they must be replaced with new museums. The American Asso- 
ciation of Museums has appointed a special commission for museum 
cooperation for the purpose of investigating this problem, with a 
view to promoting higher efficiency and closer cooperation among 
existing museums and assisting in the organization and development 
of new museums. 
Since this report was completed, the Newark Museum Association 
has published a paper on The Educational Value of Museums, by 
Louise Connolly, with an introduction by J.C. Dana. This paper is 
based on personal visits by Miss Connolly to many museums and on 
a study of the Directory of American Museums, the Proceedings of 
the American Association of Museums, the Museums Journal, and 
other literature. It is one of the most illuminating studies of this 
subject available, and will be of interest alike to museum workers 
and to school authorities.

INTRODUCTION. 
The present movement in education which is briefly described 
by the term ‘“‘survey’’ has not come upon our activities in a sud- 
den manner. It holds in part historical connection with the more 
recent tendencies which endeavor to ‘‘commission,” ‘rate,’ and 
“standardize” various features in educational activity and provisions 
for educational organization. 
The most interesting exhibition of the popular interest in educa- 
tion has been manifested in the city and State commissions which 
have been created for various purposes. Probably the earliest 
instance of this type of activity is to be found in the Educational 
Commission of the City of Chicago, which presented its report in 
1897. It was a commission of nine members, appointed by the 
mayor in such a way as to represent the city council, the board of 
education, and the outside public. Its primary object was ‘to 
utilize all that is good in the present system, to discard all that is 
defective, and to employ new methods when needed.” The work 
of this commission stood in stately isolation until the middle of the 
last decade, when, in the city of Cleveland, a study was made by 
the educational committee (1906) which had been appointed by the 
board of education to inquire into the government, supervision, and 
course of study of the Cleveland public schools. 
STATE COMMISSIONS. 
It is chiefly, however, among the States that the commission move- 
ment has been most widely extended. It may be said to have begun 
in 1905 when the Legislature of Massachusetts organized a com- 
mission of nine members for the purpose of pee eeeite “the needs

for education in the different trades of skill and especially in the 
various industries of the Commonwealth,” ‘how far the needs are 
met by existing institutions,’ and to consider ‘““what new forms of 
educational effort may be advisable.” During the next five years 
the various, particular, and general educational problems were 
committed to investigations to be conducted by educational com- 
missions in the following States: Arkansas (1910), Colorado (1910), 
Connecticut (1907), Delaware (1909), Idaho (1909), Illinois (1907), 
Indiana (1911), Iowa (1907), Kansas, Kentucky (1908), Maine 
(1909), Maryland (1909), Michigan (1909), Montana, Nebraska 
(1908), North Dakota (1907), New Jersey (1908), Oregon (1909), 
Pennsylvania (1907), South Carolina (1910), Texas (1909), Utah 
(1909), Vermont (1909), Virginia (1908), Washington (1907), West 
Virginia (1909), Wisconsin (1909). By 1908 the effort to secure the 
benefits of this method of consideration of pressing educational 
problems had reached such magnitude that the United States Com- 
missioner of Education in his introduction to the Report of the 
Commissioner of Education (vol. 1, pp. 3-6) attaches to it ranking 
importance in his analysis of the achievements of the year. 
THE SURVEY MOVEMENT. 
Beginning with the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 
the year ending June 30, 1907, one may find another anticipation 
of, if not a preparation for, the survey movement as it has developed 
in more recent years. In this report (vol. 2, ch. 19, pp. 523-541) 
there appears a special survey of the material in the most recent 
collections of the bureau which is intended to be an introduction to 
the statistical papers. In his treatment of this material Prof. 
Edward L. Thorndike continues— 
to show in some ‘measure what these statistics reveal that is of interest and significance; 
first, to all intelligent citizens; second, to the half million men and women who are 
engaged in the work of teaching; and, third, to those teachers, clergymen, statesmen, 
and other students of education who lead public opinion, and should preserve expert 
knowledge. 
The topics presented in this chapter include: What the statistics 
reveal; the facts of the educational census of 1907 and the changes 
within recent years; types and variations in American education; 
and educational relations. In the next year’s report (1908) (vol. 2, 
pp. 1057-1075), a similar method of surveying the new material col- 
lected by the Bureau of Education was continued by Prof. George D. 
Strayer in “A summary of the statistical papers.’”’ This survey pre- 
sented the following topics: Data given in the statistical papers; 
some of the facts concerning the general summary of education sta-

-P-A-G-E-551

tistics, with special reference to tendencies which are apparent from 
a comparison of data available since 1870; and to reports and varia- 
tions in educational practice for the several States. In the report 
of 1909 (vol. 2, pp. 1327-1352) Prof. Strayer gave a statistical sum- 
mary of the year’s material and selected the following topics for 
. consideration: Review of the papers in the report; financial sta- 
tistics of city school systems; retardation and acceleration of pupils 
in city schools. Again in the report of 1910 (vol. 2, pp. vii-xxvi) 
his introductory survey considered these topics: Selection of sta- 
tistics; work of the Bureau of Education for schools and improve- 
ment of social conditions in Alaska; statistical summarization;, 
retardation and elimination of pupils; the economic status of high- 
school students; some data concerning normal school students. 
The inauguration of the present movement in educational surveys 
received, without doubt, great impetus from the various efforts to 
rate schools, which began with the work of the Carnegie Foundation 
for the Advancement of Teaching. In so far as any of the associa- 
tions of colleges and preparatory schools in the different sections of 
the country controlled the activities of their members, the practice 
of estimating educational performance, as it focalized at the point 
of entering college, had doubtless gone far to suggest the desirability 
of this practice. The policy of rating and standardizing has been 
discovered to be an excellent means of molding public opinion in its 
constructive attitude toward education. One of these last manifes- 
tations is to be found in the very recent effort to apply ‘‘the efficiency 
score card”’ in the rating of rural schools as ‘‘standard”’ or ‘‘superior,” 
as is being done in Alabama, Illinois, Oregon, West Virginia, and 
other States. 
The school survey movement, however, is the logical outcome of 
the recent discovery and development of scales and other standards 
of measurement of the educational progress of individual pupils and 
an estimation of the comparative positions which these schools and 
systems of schools occupy in any fields of study. Although many of 
the surveys that have been made were actuated by more popular 
interest and gave vent to the tension of local pressure, it is highly 
probable that the survey movement of the present decade would not 
have taken form had it not been for the norms, standards, and scales 
established during the preceding decade by investigations in teach- 
ing school subjects to children and in the administration of city and 
State systems of schools. The measurement problem and the survey 
problem in education are not identical, but there is a logical as well 
as historical connection between them. The measurement problem 
calls for a detailed and experimental analysis of the facts of a given 
order; the survey problem calls for a sympathetic and critical treat- 
ment of facts of a different order. The former takes educational   
 
-P-A-G-E-552
  516 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
activity in its elemental connections, and when thoroughly accom- 
plished, succeeds in establishing standards; the latter takes educa- 
tional activity in terms of its largest relations and endeavors to give 
significance to all its details as a part of the system. The earlier 
school surveys stand in marked contrast with later surveys, because 
the standards and scales were not available for application to the 
situation discovered in the field of the particular study. A topical 
study of the scope of the surveys reveals a steady progress in the 
important matter of utilizing conclusions of scientific investigations 
in estimating the comparative value of a system of schools. 
The complex character of both the individual and social situations 
in which education is always found is well indicated by the difficulty 
which was experienced in defining the exact character of an educa- 
tional survey. Of the score or more school surveys that have been 
made, it is found that some are primarily financial, others hygienic, 
others vocational and industrial, and some primarily educational. 
The most serviceable definition of the characteristics of a genuine 
educational inquiry will probably have to be left to the cumulative 
decisions and experiences of many different trials. 
This report on educational inquiries and surveys made up to the 
close of the year covered by this annual report presents a statement 
of the place and time, the authorization, the details of the staff, the 
situation leading to the inquiry, its method and scope, the funda- 
mental problems investigated, with a statement of the more impor- 
tant particular discoveries concerning the school or system, and the 
recommendations. No attempt is made in the present chapter to 
report on the results of the effectiveness of the surveys. 
BOISE, IDAHO. 
Upon invitation of the board of education, C. N. Kendall, superin- 
tendent of schools of Indianapolis, reported on his inspection of the 
public schools of Boise, Idaho, during one week in November, 1910. 
The report appeared in the Idaho Statesman December 18, 1910. 
The guiding principles of the investigation were— 
that the efficiency or value of a system of schools is determined by five factors: First, 
the school plant; second, the teacher; third, the course of study; fourth, the organi- 
zation of the schools; fifth, the attitude of the community. 
To these is added “the question as to what the schools are doing 
for the individual children.”” The report gives no indication of any 
statistical or other quantitative study. The surveyor was impressed 
with the general excellence of the school system. Recommendations 
were made with regard to: The addition of properly equipped play- 
grounds; library facilities for the high schools; securing greater con- 
tinuity in the teaching staff; a need of more provision for adequate
-P-A-G-E-553
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 517 
industrial and manual training; attention to physical training; sys- 
tematic medical inspection; and the addition of special teachers for 
ungraded classes of retarded pupils. In the separate pamphlet pub- 
lishing the report, the superintendent of schools announces as a 
direct result of the survey— 
the addition of seven teachers, a playground director, and a school nurse; the pur- 
chase of a 40-acre playground and athletic field; the addition of an ungraded room; 
and an increase in the salaries of elementary teachers. 
These enlargements added 25 per cent to the budget, without any 
complaint from the taxpayers. 
MONTCLAIR, N. J. 
A report on the work in the public schools of Montclair, N. J., was 
made by Prof. P. H. Hanus to the board of education in May, 1911. 
The condition leading to the survey was a desire to modernize the 
course of study, which had received no essential modification since 
1903. The scope of the inquiry included a personal investigation of 
all the schools, a comparative study of school grades, and of the age 
and grade distribution of pupils. The topics of the report are: (1) 
General survey of the schools; (2) teacher and teaching; (3) the 
program of the studies (a) of the elementary schools, (6) of the high 
schools. Four days seems to have been the time given for the per- 
sonal inspection of schools and classes. 
This inquiry was characterized by a manifest desire to present 
clearly the educational responsibilities of the board of education by 
a careful study of the ‘‘present conception of the educational oppor- 
tunities the city should offer” to its children. There is an effort, 
accordingly, to determine ‘‘the nature of the social environment of 
each school, and hence of the pupils.” The report is also character- 
ized by a statement of the difficulties and limitations of the schools, 
and not by an overemphasis of their special merits. Criticisms and 
recommendations are therefore scattered throughout the report of 21 
pages. This survey is also characterized by the utilization of the 
method of comparing what was found in the Montclair schools with 
other selected schools. The tables are as follows: 1. The distribu- 
tion of scholarship grades in the Montclair high schools; 2. The dis- 
tribution of time allotment to subjects in the elementary schools 
compared with Newton and the average of 10 American cities; 3. 
A study of retardation and elimination based upon the office records; 
4. Distribution of ages by grades; 5. Nationality according to 
grades. 
The findings and recommendations emphasize the following 
points: The hygienic and educational defects of the several school 
buildings, which seem to be many, are pointed out, including the 
need of gymnasium, playground, and school garden facilities.
-P-A-G-E-554
  518 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
While the program of elementary studies is the conventional pro- 
gram throughout the country, certain difficulties are pointed out. 
According to the report more time should be given to history and 
there should be less emphasis on grammar and arithmetic in the lower 
grades. Omissions of some topics in the subjects in the seventh 
grade, redistribution of the time allotted to literature and reading, 
elimination of the drills in reading and spelling after the sixth grade, 
and a more careful differentiation of the program in the several 
elementary schools are recommended in order to meet the educa- 
tional needs of these rather distinct social groups. The last two 
years of the program of studies should differentiate by offering 
groups of studies intended, first, for those pupils who go to work in 
the industries at an early age; second, for those who go to work 
in business houses after the elementary school is finished; and, 
third, primarily for prospective high-school pupils. The high-school 
recommendations include an extension of the scope of the instruc- 
tion by certain additions in physical science, biology, physical geog- 
raphy, geology, astronomy, agriculture, and manual and domestic 
arts, foreign languages, and commercial subjects. The program of 
studies should be so constructed as to make all the instruction 
accessible to all the pupils by means of outlining suggested schedules 
of studies which pupils might follow. 
BALTIMORE, MD. 
Asa result of ‘“‘controversies” which were ‘‘a matter of common 
knowledge,” the board of school commissioners of Baltimore, Md., 
on January 25, 1911, invited Dr. Elmer E. Brown, United States 
Commissioner of Education, “(to organize a commission of three 
disinterested and competent persons to investigate and report upon 
the system of instruction now in force in the public schools of Balti- 
more City.” The commission as organized included, in addition to 
the United States Commissioner of Education, Dr. E. P. Cubberley, 
of Leland Stanford Junior University, California; Supt. C. N. Ken- 
dall, of Indianapolis, Ind.; and Dr. H. Updegraff and Mr. M. B. 
Hillegas, of the United States Bureau of Education, as assistants. 
The well-arranged and fully indexed report (112 pp.) was pub- 
lished as Bulletin 1911, No. 4, Whole No. 450, of the United States 
Bureau of Education. 
The time devoted to personal examinations and inquiries in Balti- 
more was the month of March. The two following months were 
occupied by the treatment of this material by the historical and 
comparative methods of study which were employed in the prepa- 
ration of the report. The aim of the investigation was to study the 
Baltimore elementary system as a whole, excluding the secondary
-P-A-G-E-555
  
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 519 
system and for the most part the special problems of the colored 
schools: While attention was paid to the historical development 
of the system and to a detailed analysis of the administrative func- 
tions, the teaching staff, and the courses of study, the most striking 
feature of the survey was the comparison which it made of the Balti- 
more findings with other larger cities. The report consists of five 
chapters. Chapter I details the organization and methods of the 
inquiry. Chapter II forms a history of the Baltimore system, in- 
cluding its social, legal, and financial features. Chapter III (44 
pp-.), the body of the report, gives detailed consideration to the fol- 
lowing topics: (a) System of supervision; (6) the teaching force and 
its training; (c) the elementary school curriculum. Chapter IV 
considers the school plant and the attendance, health, and discipline 
of pupils. Chapter V brings together the educational views and 
suggestions. The descriptive material of the report is well supported 
by 25 tables, 13 figures, and 2 analytical charts. 
According to the census of 1910, Baltimore was the seventh of the 
13 larger cities in the country having a population of over 350,000, 
thus occupying a middle point in this list of 13. The population 
basis of comparison is utilized throughout the study. The total 
expense of the schools was $3.32 per capita of population (1908), 
Baltimore thus ranking next to the last of the 13 cities. School 
expenses were 24 per cent of total city expenses (1908), Baltimore 
ranking ninth in this respect. For every dollar spent on police 
Baltimore was spending $1.47 for schools, ranking eleventh. 
In carrying on the general and special services in all municipal 
affairs it was found that Baltimore expended $13.29 per capita, 
ranking eleventh in this particular also. Its per capita cost of total 
expense of elementary schools, based on enrollment, was $18.71, 
which ranked it the lowest on the list. The same situation obtained 
in the per capita cost of salaries in the elementary schools, which was 
$13.95. 
In the study of the training and instruction in the elementary day 
school, which takes up more than one-third of the report, it was found 
that one of the most pressing needs of the schools of Baltimore was 
a very material increase in the supervisory force. 
It is recommended that there be an increase in the number of assistant superintend- 
ents in the staff of special supervisors, the creation of a staff of primary school super- 
visors, and that in all elementary schools having 20 or more teachers with all of the 
grades represented all of the time of the principal should be devoted to supervision. 
Tho preparation of the teaching force was criticised, and it was 
recommended that there be secured ‘‘more academic and broader 
scholarship, as well as professional attainments on the part of teach- 
ers,’ and that ‘‘increased attention be given to securing teachers 
 
-P-A-G-E-556
    520 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
who have had training and experience outside of the schools of Balti- 
more.” The serious condition of the schools was traced in large part 
to the ‘‘decidedly low” salaries paid to elementary teachers. In 
spite of the absence of a definite time allotment for the various sub- 
jects in the course of study, it was found that in practice such an 
allotment is made. This practice receives the unqualified approval 
of the commission, because it is in agreement with the prevailing 
practice elsewhere. A detailed study is made of the following sub- 
jects: English, mathematics, geography, nature study, drawing, 
physiology and hygiene, handwork, and industrial subjects. The 
prevailing practice in the teaching method receives criticism because 
“not enough use is made of the principle of apperception.”” The sub- 
sidiary topics making up Chapters IV and V are presented, as it were, 
in passing, and do not enter into a vital part of the inquiry. 
The summary of its findings and recommendations is presented in 
the report (pp. 8-15). It is found that the system shows elements 
both of strength and weakness, although its conditions have changed 
for the better since the adoption of the charter of 1898, under which 
the schools are being improved. Emphasis is placed upon the fact 
that the administration of a system of schools must be directed 
“toward the interests of the whole community quite apart from pri- 
vate and factional interests.’’ It is recommended that the expendi- 
tures for schools should at least be brought approximately to the level 
of other cities of the same population. While finding much to criti- 
cise, the inquiry resulted ‘‘in an opinion favorable” regarding the 
system. Special endeavor is made to keep entirely clear of the 
recent controversies which seemed to have checked the forward 
movement in the improvement of the system. It is recommended 
that the system of organization of the elementary schools which 
‘provides for supervision by vertical divisions” be supplemented by 
an increased amount of ‘‘horizontal supervision in the case of special 
subjects.” The difficulties of administration due to the charter pro- 
visions under which teachers have permanent tenure of their positions 
receives extended attention. The commission regarded ‘‘promo- 
tional examinations as a proper and serviceable method looking to 
the improvement of a body of teachers, many of whom are below a 
reasonable standard for the present day as regards general and pro- 
fessional education.’ While the elementary course of study was 
regarded as moderately conservative, it was found to compare favor- 
ably with that of other large cities and is especially commended 
because of its general policy of cooperation with the teachers in its 
elaboration. The objections to coeducation were found to be a 
purely local situation. The unsatisfactory condition of many of the 
schoolhouses was a final fault which should be remedied.

BOSTON, MASS. 
On October 7, 1911, the finance commission of the city of Boston 
presented its report on the Boston school system which had been 
made in response to the request of Mayor John F. Fitzgerald. The 
invitation was— 
to conduct such an inquiry into the methods of the school and schoolhouse depart- 
ments and the results attained as shall either satisfy the public mind of the need of 
these increased expenditures or suggest a specific policy of retrenchment. 
The request for this investigation was made March 17, 1910. 
Twenty-seven additional questions were submitted by the mayor to 
the commission between the date of the request for the school inves- 
tigation and April 1, 1911, the majority of which related to matters 
outside the school departments. This accounts for the unexpected 
delay in the completion of ‘‘a task of such magnitude as the investi- 
gation of the public schools.” 
The report presents a study of the historical survey of the develop- 
ment of the present system of schools, both educational and financial. 
It adopts a comparative method of studying its administration with 
that in the leading cities in the United States, the school year of 1909 
having been used as the period for investigation. The report (229 pp.) 
is presented in five parts, as follows: (1) Introductory; (2)develop- 
ment and growth of the schools; (3) financial review; (4) comparison 
with other cities; (5) conclusions and recommendations of the com- 
mission. It includes 15 statistical tables, 13 of which exhibit com- 
parison with other cities; and three appendices, consisting of special 
reports on the Boston Normal School, the Mechanic Arts High School, 
and on salaries of elementary-school teachers. 
The bulk of the report (pp. 10-99) offered a detailed study of the 
historical development, and especially of the recent growth of the 
public schools, so as to have full information of the conditions under 
which the increasing cost was made necessary. The critical in- 
vestigation of the development from 1898 to 1911 resulted on the 
whole in a justification of the educational features of the system. 
1. No thoroughly satisfactory comparisons of costs can be made between the Boston 
school system and those of other cities, because of the difference in the methods of 
school accounting, in the presentation of school data, and in school conditions. So 
far as such comparisons can be made, however, they are on the whole favorable to 
Boston. 
2. Boston’s schools have reached their present condition under the guidance of 
those wise counselors whose aim has been the development of a well-ordered system 
of centralized authority in which the school committee should legislate upon matters 
of general policy, while the details of administration should be cared for by paid 
officials trained in educational and business affairs. 
3. The administration of the school committee, both on the educational and busi- 
ness sides, is entitled to the full confidence of the community. At no time in the 
history of the schools have they been conducted in a more intelligent or economical
-P-A-G-E-558
    522 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
manner than at present. In the matter of getting a dollar’s worth of value for every 
dollar spent the school department contrasts very favorably with most other de- 
partments of the city. In fact, other departments-might well study this department 
with a view to imitating it in regard to scales of salary, absence of unnecessary em- 
ployees, economical methods of purchase, intelligent schemes of supervision and 
organization, merit system of promotion and exclusion of politics from appointments. 
The school department is not perfect in these respects, but when the other depart- 
ments are brought to the same level, or nearly to the same level, the city will have 
made an enormous step in advance. 
4, There is very little opportunity for retrenchment in school expenditures. 
Although the amount expended annually is large, the purposes for which the money 
is spent are definitely fixed by statute or by schedule, or by the actual necessities of 
the situation; for example: 
(a) Salaries of instructors, janitors, and subordinates are established upon carefully 
prepared schedules, which can not in justice be reduced. To meet them, there is 
required each year more than four-fifths of the total appropriations. Salaries of 
officials are in addition, and an analysis shows that none of En eee is excessive. 
- (b) Pensions, the cost of physical education, of nurses, and of repairs are the sub- 
jects of special statutes, and the amounts authorized are not too large. 
(c) Fuel, light, and power are necessities, which the finance commission believes 
are being provided economically. 
(d) Books are also necessities, in the purchase of which there seems to be no practical 
way to effect material economies. 
¢) Trust funds can not be touched, except for their own definite purposes. 
f f) Allthat remains is the item of incidentals, which includes supplies of all kinds 
other than books. This amounts to only about 3 per cent of the total school expenses, 
and any material reduction would not only be insignificant in amount, but harmful 
to the school system. The only just criticism that can be made here is that the financial 
needs of the schools have sometimes compelled a too great economy in this direction. 
5. The large expenditures of recent years are due to an attempt to supply the defi- 
ciencies of previous years and to meet real needs. In response to popular demands 
many experiments have been made and are being made which have not yet fully 
shown their worth. Some of these experiments may fail; but all progress comes 
through experiment. There is nothing which is being done which is not worth serious 
consideration and a fair trial. 
6. The introduction of advisory committees is excellent, if not carried too far. 
These advisory committees are not elected by or in any way responsible to the people; 
they are quite large, and are made up of busy men, whose early interest sometimes 
wanes, and the real control falls into the hands of a few energetic enthusiasts. The 
responsibility of final decision in all matters must rest with the school committee, 
and in weighing the advice given the question of how far the entire advisory com- 
mittee has taken part in the matter should be considered. The history of the non- 
elected primary-school committee from 1818 to 1854, and its controversy with the 
elected school committee which created it, is a warning against the dangers that may 
arise in this direction. 
The commission recommends: 
1. That the names attached to the positions of auditor and business agent be trans- 
ferred one to the other, so that each office shall have a name which properly describes 
it, and that the present confusion of duties may be avoided. 
2. That the publication of two reports, one by the business agent and one by the 
auditor, be discontinued, and that there be substituted therefor a single report on 
school finances, which may be prepared by the two officials in cooperation, or may 
contain reports from each, but which shall contain no duplication of material. 
3. That the schools be given jurisdiction over licenses of all minors, of whatever 
age, who attend school.
-P-A-G-E-559
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 523 
4. That the board of superintendents and other highly paid officials be allowed 
sufficient clerical assistance whenever it is required in the discharge of their duties. 
5. That clerical assistants to the principals be appointed in the elementary schools. 
6. That books be not allowed in the schools after they have been removed from the 
authorized lists; nor after they have become unduly worn or unclean. 
7. That every care be taken to exclude incompetent teachers from the service; 
and to that end that a more complete and thorough system of visitation of schools and 
teachers be introduced, possibly through an enlargement and extension of the de- 
partmené under the supervisor of substitutes. 
8. That the policy of reducing the quota of pupils to teachers in the high and ele- 
mentary schools be continued, and that still further reductions be made. 
9. That the existing policy of permitting the use of school buildings for other than 
school purposes be extended as funds become available. 
10. That, if necessary, the legislature be asked to grant a larger appropriation for 
school purposes. This can readily be done without materially raising the tax rate, 
if reasonable economies so often recommended by the finance commission be intro- 
duced in other municipal departments. Waste due to political methods in other de- 
partments should not be allowed to absorb the money needed by the child, 
EAST ORANGE, N. J. 
On December 12, 1911, Prof. Ernest C. Moore, Yale University, 
presented to the special committee of the board of education to 
investigate the educational efficiency of the schools of East Orange, 
N. J., his report on the study of the schools of that city, which he 
made during 10 weeks’ time. The examination was to be made “in 
any manner he deemed best,” and his report was to be prepared 
“without consultation with the committee.” The object of the 
inquiry was to pronounce upon “the educational efficiency” of the 
East Orange schools. The method adopted was that of personal 
visitation in the schools, conferences with members of the staff, and 
comparative studies with schools in other cities. The inquiry recog- 
nized that there is ‘“‘no single test by which a system of schools may 
be judged.” A few of the conditions which produce efficiency were 
studied and led to the detailed consideration of the following topics: 
I. The historical sketch of the schoel system; II. The community 
and. efficiency of the schools; III. The board of education and the 
efficiency of the schools; TV. Cost as related to the efficiency of 
the schools; V. A general survey of the schools and their efficiency; 
VI. The teachers and their work; VII. A new course of study; 
VIL. The high school. An interesting feature of the inquiry was the 
examination of ‘all the pupils in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades in the four fundamental principles of arithmetic, English 
composition, writing, and spelling.” Special attention was given to 
the high-school situation, because it was believed that any defects in 
the elementary schools would be apt to appear very clearly under 
the strain of the “transition” which pupils make in passing to the 
secondary teachers. The report includes 19 statistical tables. In 
making the 29 recommendations which are presented throughout the    
-P-A-G-E-560
  
  524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
report and summarized at the close, the aim was to estimate the work 
of the system by comparing it with the best school practice in the 
cities of similar size and conditions and to apply, so far as possible, 
the “principles of scientific management.” 
The surveyor’s summary of recommendations is as follows: 
In the case of the entire system it is specified: 
1. That a systematic effort be made to secure a more active cooperation on the part 
of parents who have children in the schools. + 
2. That there be a more thorough systematization of the work of the board of edu- 
cation, the superintendent of schools, and the other officers of the system, such as 
shall specify the functions and responsibilities of each. 
With respect to elementary schools it is recommended: 
3. That changes needed to insure greater protection against fire be made. 
4, That ventilation of buildings be improved. 
5. That additional ground be added where most needed and that more library 
books, dictionaries, and encyclopedias be provided where they are needed. 
6. That kindergarten children attend but one session. 
7. That the school day for first and second grade children be made as short as pos- 
sible consistent with the requirements of the school law. 
8. That the hours of required home study be greatly reduced. 
9. That emphasis be shifted from an examination system of schools to a system 
which uses examinations as mere incidental features of its work. That formal ex- 
aminations be given at the end of each term and that all students be required to take 
them. 
10. That regular reports on the standing of pupils be sent to their parents twice a 
year and irregular ones whenever they are necessary. 
11. That the authority of supervisors of instruction in special subjects be strictly 
defined. 
12.. That principals be not required to teach so much, and thus be left more free for 
their work of supervision. 
13. That meetings be held for the discussion of recent contributions to the literature 
of education. 
14. That a systematic effort be made to further reduce the number of over-age 
pupils in the several grades. 
15. That teachers do more individual work with backward children, and, if possible, 
that another ungraded room be opened for irregular pupils. 
16. That an effort be made to secure greater permanence in the teaching staff by 
raising the salary of teachers. 
17. That a new course of study be framed. Some changes which should be made 
are suggested. 
18. That standards of quality be raised and standards of quantity be lowered. 
19. That teachers do less and pupils do more in the daily work of the schools. 
The situation regarding the high schools led to the following 
recommendations: 
20. That a librarian be appointed at the high school and all needed books be 
supplied. z 
21. That all the shops needed for good technical work be equipped as soon as funds 
are available. 
22. That a gymnasium, preferably an open-air one, be equipped at once. 
23. That a male physician be detailed to make the health examinations of boys at 
the high school and that the physical directors make such independent examinations 
as they need to make to carry on their work to advantage.
-P-A-G-E-561
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 525 
24, That formal examinations be required only at the end of each term and that 
all students take them; that regular reports be sent home twice each year, irregular 
ones whenever necessary; that after repeated failures students be put into a lower 
class. 
25. That the practice of having students return in the afternoon to do work which 
should have been done in the morning be abolished and that teachers arrange to hold 
regular office hours for the convenience of students who may wish to consult them. 
26. That a systematic effort be made to cut down the number of failures in high- 
school work; that the chasm between the elementary and high schools be bridged. 
27. That a six-year high-school course be established and that provision be made 
so that pupils who have finished six years of elementary school work may then elect 
either to take a six-year high-school course or instruction in a vocational course, which 
should be established, or go on in an eight-grade elementary school as at present. 
28. That provision be made for vocational assistance. 
29. That high-school students be required to give up membership in all academic 
secret societies and that the student organizations of the high school be built up. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MD. 
The department of church and country life of the board of home 
missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America 
has undertaken several sociological surveys to the end of advancing 
its own particular interests. In 1912 it published its report of the 
special study which was made of Montgomery County, Md., at the 
invitation of the Montgomery County country life committee. Two 
investigators, Mr. E. S. Eastman and Mr. H. N. Morse, were in the 
field from January to April. The survey included a special study of 
the schools, which was designed to be complete and accurate. Its 
plans were perfected through the assistance, among others, of Assisant 
Secretary of Agriculture W. M. Hayes, E. B. Wood, county superin- 
tendent of schools, and A. C. Monahan, of the United States Bureau of 
Education. The report (120 pp.) is well prepared, and includes 2 
maps, 10 diagrams, 26 tables, and many pictures. 
The topics include: Location and topography; economic conditions 
and resources; the business of farming; population; social needs; 
social welfare and organizations; recreation; Sandy Spring neighbor- 
hood; educational conditions; religious conditions and activities; and 
concludes with suggestions and recommendations concerning eco- 
nomic and educational conditions. The educational section (pp. 
66-89) constitutes about one-fifth of the entire report. A fuller 
report of the educational survey was published by the Bureau of 
Education as Bulletin No. 32, 1913, Educational Survey of Montgom- 
ery County, Md. 
A statement of the facts respecting the schools of the county 
includes a description of the county school system of Maryland, the 
detailed enumeration of the schools for the white and for the colored 
children, the material equipment (including grounds), the teaching 
force, the curriculum, the school budget, patrons, the education of 
adults, and the private schools and colleges in the county.
-P-A-G-E-562
  526 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
The educational recommendations approve strongly of the county 
system of organization, since “under no other form of organization 
such rapid development has taken place in rural school advance,” 
with the exception of efficient township organization in certain 
thickly settled sections of the county. The weakness of the system 
is most apparent in the amount of supervision of the teachers, which 
is left entirely to the county superintendent. The employment of 
three assistant superintendents for this work is definitely recom- 
mended. The course of study is found to be conservative in its 
traditional use of the common branches. It therefore needs a read- 
justment so that it ‘will be more closely correlated with the life 
and interests of the community.” Especial attention is called to 
the need of instruction in elementary agriculture, domestic science, 
manual training, music, and drawing. The entire curriculum should 
be taught in terms of these subjects. The number of schools is 
found to be too great, and, in the interest of efficiency and economy, 
consolidation of schools is recommended on the ratio of one school 
for every 15 square miles. In certain sections this area might be 
increased to 25 square miles. This plan of consolidation would 
reduce the overabundance of small elementary schools. The schools 
for negro children ‘‘are relatively inefficient, as compared with the 
white schools, * * * and are poorly housed, equipped, and 
supported.” Tables 18-24, inclusive, in the appendix give the 
enrollment of the white and colored schools by grades; the teaching 
of special subjects; the distribution of school expenditures; and the 
sources of school money.* 
VERMONT: SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
Soon after the establishment in 1908 of a department of pedagogy 
at Middlebury College, Vermont, the college recognized— 
the necessity of a more intimate knowledge of conditions in the high schools and 
academies of Vermont, their special needs.and problems, in order toa clearer under- 
standing of its mission in helping these schools to be more efficient means in serving 
their constituents. 
  
1 Mention may be made of seven other “‘rural” or ‘‘rural life” surveys made by the department cf 
church and country life of the board of home missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States 
of America, Dr. Warren H. Wilson, superintendent, and Miss Anna B. Taft, secretary: 
a, A Rural Survey in Missouri (Adair, Sullivan, and Knox Counties), E. F. Eastman and A. T. 
Boisen, (no date); 
b. A Rural Survey in Tennessee (Gibson County), A. T. Boisen, 1911; 
c. A Rural Survey in Arkansas (Benton County), J. O. Ashenhurst, 1912-13; 
d. Ohio Rural Life Surveys: (1) Northwestern Ohio (Seneca, Hancock, Allen, and Defiance Counties), 
R. A. Felton, field director, 1912, 1913; (2) Southeastern Ohio(Washington, Morgan, Athens, Vinton, 
‘Lawrence, and Adams Counties), R. A. Felton, 1912, 1913; (3) Southwestern Ohio (Darke, Mont- 
gomery, Preble, and Butler Counties), Dr. Paul L. Vogt, professor of sociology, Miami University, 
April, 1913; (4) Greene and Clermont Counties, Dr. Paul L. Vogt, March, 1914. 
‘These surveys follow in general the scheme detailed in the Montgomery County, Md., report, in which 
tural school conditions are one of the several economic and social phases of life surveyed. The four Ohio 
surveys were made in part during the Ohio State survey, and the data were treated accordingly.
-P-A-G-E-563
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. Saw. 
Accordingly, Prof. R. McFarland, professor of secondary education, 
conducted an inquiry through a personal visitation extending over a 
period of four months, from October 1, 1911, to February 1, 1912. In 
making the visitation and inspection, the inquirer followed the form 
used by the inspector ef high schools in the State of Maine. The 
scope of the inquiry included 54 high schools, 16 academies, 2 normal 
schools, the industrial school, and the State agricultural school. This 
represented 88 per cent of the teaching staff and 77 per cent of the 
secondary school system of the State. The classroom work of 209 
teachers in 296 recitations was observed. 
The chief topics of inquiry included physical conditions, such as 
building, grounds, heating, lighting, sanitation, janitor work, venti- 
lation, equipment in library and laboratory, teaching staff, the amount 
of education and professional training, experience in teaching, sub- 
jects taught and salaries, the observation of recitations, the organiza- 
tion of the high schools, the attendance of students, the courses of 
study, and a group of miscellaneous items including working spirit of 
school, management, discipline, spirit of community, and deficiencies 
in preparation of the entering class. The report (43 pp.) was pub- 
lished by the college in May, 1912. 
The chief discovery of this inquiry into the conditions of high 
schools and academies in Vermont was “the need of complete reor- 
ganization of the system.” To this end the following suggestions were 
made: 
1, That the work of the State department of education be extended more com- 
pletely into the field of secondary education. 
2. That the State require inspection of high schools and a satisfactory conformation 
of approved schools to a minimum standard. 
3. That a more detailed system of records and reports for schools be developed, that 
a cumulative record of every pupil be kept in every school and that approved schools 
take inventories of library equipment, laboratory supplies, and other school property 
annually, and furnish duplicate copies of the same to the department of education. 
4, That approved schools possess a minimum laboratory equipment for each of the 
major and one of the minor sciences offered in its course. 
5. That approved schools possess standard lists of books for each course offered in 
his 5 
eae syllabi and manuals for the teacher’s guidance be furnished to the high 
schools by the department of education. 
7. That certification of teachers entering secondary school service be based on higher 
academic and professional attainments. 
8. That enriched courses of study be provided for both the regular four-year high 
school and prospective six-year high schools. 
9. That the school year be increased to 40 weeks for approved high schools and to 
36 weeks for eight years for elementary schools. In the latter case it would result in 
the saving of a year of the pupil’s time over the present practice of having nine years 
of 32 weeks each. 
10. That six-year high schools be established wherever practicable, these schools to 
continue the work of six-year elementary schools that have 36 weeks in the school year.   
 
-P-A-G-E-564
528 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
11. That more careful provision be made for the inspection of the heating, light- 
ing, sanitation, and ventilation of school buildings. 
12. That the high schools in the smaller communities which show a spirit of liberal 
support of schools be encouraged by special State appropriations. 
SYRACUSE, N. Y. 
In May, 1912, a report on the public schools, made by Horace L. 
Brittain, of the training school for public service conducted by the 
Bureau of Municipal Research in New York City, was submitted to 
the associated charities of Syracuse. The report presented 19 “sig- 
nificant facts disclosed by the school survey,” and detailed 22 “con- 
structive suggestions for correcting the defects noted in the preceding 
significant facts.’ Seven schools were visited and the office arrange- 
ments observed. Among the findings, emphasis was placed upon 
school grounds, sanitary, hygienic, and esthetic conditions of 
school buildings and rooms, overcrowding, nonattendance, nonpro- 
motion, low salaries, and inadequate records for gathering over-age 
elimination and physical and mental defects. In eight particulars 
Syracuse is credited with having “the germs of several advanced 
movements.’ The printed statement of the report lists four things 
which have been done relating to systems of records, over-age account- 
ing, dry sweeping, and playgrounds. 
GREENWICH, CONN. 
At the town meeting of Greenwich, Conn., on December 9, 1911, 
the joint report of the special committee and the town school com- 
mittee, as to the needs of the town in the matter of school accommo- 
dations, was adopted. Owing to ‘an increase during the previous 
seven years of more than 50 per cent of the number of enumerated 
children of school age,” the problem of school accommodation had 
become very acute. The situation was one calling for relief, and 
the investigation was devoted to a study of this particular problem. 
In June, 1912, an educational exhibit was held, in which were 
presented the results of the school investigation which had been con- 
ducted by the committee in cooperation with Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, 
of the Russell Sage Foundation. A report of this investigation is 
found in The Book of the Educational Exhibit. of Greenwich, Conn., 
and in the address on ‘‘Greenwich schools from an outside stand- 
point,” by Dr. Ayres, delivered June 15, at the closing session of the 
exhibit. The report is a brief, but striking, presentation of the con- 
ditions which were found. By the use of pictures, diagrams, and 
charts, the peculiar state of affairs in this town was convincingly pre- 
sented. It was found, first, that there was no real school system, 
that only ‘‘a school conglomeration’’ existed; second, that Green- 
wich is the second richest town in America; third, that it had been 
maintaining a ‘“‘penurious policy toward its public schools * * *

that is little short of appalling.”’” The main points include the inade- 
quate and bad conditions of the school plant, school sites, over- 
crowding and air space, fire protection, cellars, lighting, vermin, and 
toilets. The school needs that were pointed out include: 
I. A bigger, better school budget, based on a generous bond issue and designed to 
care for future growth as well as present necessities. 
II. A modern and adequate school plant, providing a seat for every pupil. 
III. A permanent school policy and an intelligent public sentiment that shall 
demand, as the inalienable right of each child, pure air, sufficient warmth for comfort, 
uncontaminated water, lighting that does not ruin eyesight, protection from the perils 
of fire, school locations not dangerous to health, and decent toilets. 
IV. Consolidation of rural schools with transportation of pupils to the more efficient 
and less expensive graded schools. 
Vy. A truly democratic aim in Greenwich education, an aim that shall reach every 
child and the whole of every child, an aim that shall be as much concerned about the 
progress of every child as it is about its presence, and as much concerned about its 
health as it is about its head. 
WISCONSIN RURAL SCHOOLS. 
In August, 1912, the training school for public service of the New 
York Bureau of Municipal Research made its ‘Preliminary report on 
conditions and needs of rural schools in Wisconsin,” containing the 
results of field study reported through the Wisconsin State board of 
public affairs, which conducted the study. The scope of the inquiry 
included— 
a general examination of conditions in 27 counties in widely separated portions of the 
State, and a more detailed investigation of conditions in 131 schools in 13 counties. 
The investigators were S. G. Lindholm, A. N. Farmer, and H. L. 
Brittain. F. S. Staley, field agent of the State board of public 
affairs, gathered most of the facts about rural-school accounting. 
The report (92 pp.) is divided into the following seven parts: 
Factors which make for progress in rural schools; lax methods of 
controlling school expenditures; sanitary and educational conditions 
of rural schools; some serious defects of county supervision; some 
serious defects of State supervision; contrast between State super- 
vision of State graded schools and State supervision of rural schools; 
suggested administrative and legislative remedies. The method of 
exposition used in the report details specific statements in such a 
way that it is difficult to summarize them. In presenting the mate- 
rial, 66 rubrics under special headings were used. It appears that 
emphasis was placed upon the primitive conditions of the rural 
schools and certain aspects of maladministration which were disclosed. 
The 15 specific recommendations included the following: 
1. The election of county boards of education at the general school election. 
. 2. Specific conditions under which State aid should be given to county boards of 
education to assist in the proper maintenance of the office of county superintendent.

3. The appointment of inspectors to insure the proper teaching of agriculture and 
domestic economics. 
4. The encouragement of the introduction of contests in these two subjects, and the 
promotion by free scholarships of the training of teachers of agriculture and domestic 
economics. 
5. The addition of farm accounting, medical inspection, more agriculture, and 
methods of keeping records and acceunts in the curriculum of the county training 
schools. 
6. Raising the qualifications for obtaining the teacher’s certificate. 
7. A revision of the State Manual. : 
8. Increasing the staff of school inspectors. 
9. A closer cooperation. between the schools and circulating libraries. 
10. The readjustment of school-district laws so as to insure the education of all 
children of school age. 
11. Wider publicity of school facts. 
12. A supervision of the use of school money. 
13. An increase in State aid and State supervision of rural schools which should be 
classified in four groups for the purposes of subvention and inspection. 
WESTCHESTER COUNTY, N. Y. 
An interesting instance of the manifestation of the survey spirit 
is to be found in “a study of local school conditions” by Prof. Alex- 
ander J. Inglis, of Rutgers College, on the school reports in Westches- 
ter County, which was made during the summer of 1912, under the 
auspices of the Westchester County research bureau. School condi- 
tions were not studied, since the work was conducted chiefly during 
the vacation time. 
It was hoped, however, that by an examination of the previous 
records of the various schools and superintendency districts, there 
should be shown the efficiency of the schools in respect to the follow- 
ing particulars: 
1, As to how far the compulsory attendance laws of New York 
State are carried out. 
2. As to how rapidly or how slowly progress is made through the 
grades by those who attend the schools. 
38. As to how capable the schools are in the matter of carrying all 
the students all the way through the scheduled courses of study 
4. As to the total cost, to the taxpayer, of the school system, and 
the comparative cost per pupil in the various districts. 
The report (23 pp., appendix 6 pp.) emphasizes the importance of 
school reports and proper publicity being given to them for the 
benefit of taxpayers. Detailed rubrics presenting ‘the elements of 
efficiency which should be reported” center upon attendance, continu- 
ation, curriculum, and economy. The accessible records of the entire 
county were examined so as to show the rules and procedure by which 
the rich material in school registers may be collected and treated so
-P-A-G-E-567
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 531 
as to be made to yield the most desirable information respecting the 
activities in the school system. Formulas are worked out and illus- 
trated by tables in such a way that the study becomes a contribution 
to the material on school records for administrative purposes. 
THE FORTY-EIGHT STATES. 
In December, 1912, the division of education of the Russell Sage 
Foundation published ‘A Comparative Study of the Public School 
Systems in the Forty-eight States.’’ The purpose of the study was 
to make— 
available to legislators, school workers, and others having at heart the interest in 
public education, salient facts concerning school conditions in all the States. 
The study (33 pp.) comprises 11 tables, 12 diagrams, and 4 maps. 
The statistical material was based, so far as possible, on data pub- 
lished in the Report of the United States Commissioner of Education 
for 1911. The figures— 
were derived from official sources and every care exercised to insure their accu- 
racy. * * * The object of the work is to render available to each State the experi- 
ence of all. 
The general method was to follow the lead of comparative columns 
in such a way as to establish on the basis of the ‘10 tests of efficiency” 
the approximate rank of each of the 48 States in 1910. The 10 tests 
of efficiency adopted were: The number of children enrolled in school; 
the value of public school property; the average annual expenditure 
per child; the number of school days of attendance by each pupil 
enrolled; the length of the school year; the average attendance; the 
amount of school expenditure compared with wealth; the daily cost 
of schooling a child; the number of students in high schools; and the 
annual salary of teachers. 
The topics presented in the tables, diagrams, and maps are as fol- 
lows: Children in school and out; half a billion a year for schools; 
investment in school plant; expenditure per child of school age; days 
of schooling per year if each child got his share; how long a year and 
how much attendance; compulsory-attendance legislation; what they 
have and what they spend; the daily cost per child attending; school 
mortality and survival; workers and wages; our army of illiterates; 
schoolhouse construction legislation; textbook legislation; medical 
inspection legislation. 
By a simple, yet ingenious device, a final chart was tabulated in 
which each of the 48 States was given its ranking position under each 
of the 10 tests of efficiency, as determined by the data selected which 
its official departments had made public.

  532 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
ATLANTA, GA. 
In December, 1912, Mr. S. G. Lindholm, of the New York Bureau 
of Municipal Research, presented his report of the survey of the 
department of education of the city of Atlanta, which was made for 
the committee of municipal research of the Atlanta Chamber of 
Commerce. Four days’ time was given to the examination of the 
city’s department of education. The findings are represented under 
the following different headings: Evidence of progress noted; weak- 
nesses in the present administration; defects in administrative 
records; recommendations; expenditures. This study emphasized 
“the importance of the record and publicity side of school work,” 
because only through such ‘‘controlling records”’ can the satisfactory 
promotion of education be secured. 
The report presents 21 ‘‘tentative constructive suggestions for 
correcting conditions noted in Atlanta’s schools during a short field 
survey.” Many of these enumerate from four to seven minor points, 
making the recommendations fairly exhaustive. They include among 
other items the following: The reduction of possible dangers from 
fire; importance of all forms of sanitary conditions; the installation 
of continuous record cards; the adoption of uniform financial records; 
taking an immediate school census; organizing the quality of class- 
room instruction; a fact basis of attendance, school property, etc., 
for the annual budget estimates; the importance of school play- 
grounds and the provision of adequate play space; the appointment 
of an assistant to the superintendent, who shall make continuous 
tests of the classroom efficiency of teachers; a wider use of the public- 
school plant; and the strengthening of public-school sentiment 
through the school board and the chamber of commerce. 
BOISE, IDAHO. 
Two years after the inquiry by Supt. Kendall, a second study of 
the public schools of Boise, Idaho, was made by Prof. Edward ©. 
Elliott, of the University of Wisconsin; Prof. Charles H. Judd, of 
the University of Chicago; and Prof. George D. Strayer, of Columbia 
University; and published as The Expert Survey of the Public- 
School System of Boise, Idaho. This report of 31 pages includes a 
special 4-page report on instruction, by Prof. Edward C. Elliott, 
based upon two days’ investigation of the schools. The scope of 
the examination included the course of study, the methods of super- 
vision, the character of the teaching staff, the distribution and 
progress of children throughout the grades, the material and equip- 
ment, and the expenditures involved in the conduct of the system. 
Most of the necessary material was available in the office records. 
Where additional facts were needed, they were secured through the
-P-A-G-E-569
   SCHOOL SURVEYS. 533 
school officers or personal inspection. The study was greatly facili- 
tated through the cooperation of the local officials. 
The findings and recommendations of the committee are briefly 
summarized as follows: 
1. As to the course of study: This has been arranged on a comprehensive basis with 
proper attention to fundamentals and with a commendable effort to adapt the instruc- 
tion in the schools to the practical demands of modern community life. 
2. The supervisory staff is organized in accordance with the practice prevailing in 
the most progressive cities of the United States. There is evidence of complete 
cooperation between the supervisors and the teachers. Further cooperation between 
the several supervisors of the elementary schools and the high school is suggested. 
3. As to the teaching staff: A high standard of qualification has been maintained 
for the teaching staff. In the matter of selection, salary, and tenure of teaching, 
the present practices represent an enlightened and progressive school policy. 
4, As to the classification and progress of children through the school system: By 
comparison with 318 other cities in the United States there is definite evidence that 
the problem of the proper classification of children as to over-age is being successfully 
handled;, that adequate provision has been made to permit children of unusual 
ability to advance rapidly; that pupils are retained in school to an extent that is 
equaled by very few cities. 
5. As to the school plant: This is in'a highly satisfactory condition. The present 
policy of the school authorities as to the selection of sites, the construction, repair, 
and care of school buildings, and the provision for play parks is approved. 
6. As to school expenditures: On the basis of a comparison with 37 selected cities, 
it is found that: (a) Owing to the high qualifications of teachers and the variety of 
school activities, Boise ranks fairly high in the cost of elementary education; (b) owing 
to careful management, the cost of high-school education in Boise is less than in 
half of the other cities; (c) owing to the very large percentage of children in the high 
school, Boise devotes to the high school a relatively large proportion of all the money 
spent for public education; (d) a larger part than is customary of the money available 
for public education is devoted to paying for instruction and a smaller part for main- 
tenance and operation of the plant. 
7. As to community cooperation: The community and the school system cooperate 
in a most commendable manner. The school officials enjoy the general confidence 
of the community and receive its undivided support in their efforts to develop the 
school system to the highest possible degree of effectiveness. 
The specific recommendations were as follows: 
I. That the school day, the school week, and the school year be lengthened, in 
order better to adapt the course of study and to utilize completely the school plant, 
II. That the eighth grade be eliminated. 
Ill. That the high-school course of instruction be extended by giving advanced 
courses ordinarily given in the first years of college. 
IV. That the work of the supervisory staff be developed by (a) continuing and 
changing exhibits of school work, (6) demonstration lessons, (c) the cooperation of 
teachers in the making of courses of study. 
V. That a systematic record of teachers as to training, experience, appointment, 
promotion, and performance be instituted. 
VI. That special classes for slow and backward children be established. 
VII. That a system of cumulative records of pupils be instituted.

  534 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
BRIDGEPORT, CONN. 
On February 20, 1913, Supt. James H. Van Sickle, of Springfield, 
Mass., presented to the special committee on investigation of the school 
system his report on the condition and needs of the Bridgeport schools. 
In conducting the investigation, for the results of which he assumed 
“full responsibility for every portion,” he was assisted in parts of the 
investigation named by the following persons: Dr. Leonard P. Ayres— 
The expenditures for schools compared with those of other cities; 
Dr. Andrew W. Edson—City normal school; Dr. Henry S. West— 
The high-school situation; Mr. Wilbur F. Gordy—History in the 
grades and high school; Mr. Egbert E. MacNary—Industrial condi- 
tions; Mr. Edwin Hebden—Arithmetic work in the grades; and Mr. 
Edward H. Webster—Language work in the grades. 
The report (129 pp.) deals with the following topics: The school 
board, the financial support of the school system, distribution of 
pupils in the schools, proposed changes in organization, the city 
normal school, the high school, the industries of Bridgeport, history, 
English, arithmetic. Fifteen tables, seven figures, and seven dia- 
grams, with a number of minor tabulations, contribute to the expo- 
sition of the method and results of the investigation. This inquiry 
is marked because of the evident concentration of its studies on the 
teaching aspects of the school system. 
The findings are summarized in 67 statements arranged under 
seven headings at the end of the report (pp. 124-129), while the rec- 
ommendations with preliminary comments, under nine headings, are 
stated at the beginning (pp. 5-10). The former give a fairly com- 
plete view of the features of the school system, and are as follows: 
Financial Support of the School System: 
1. How much education and how good an education a community actually gets for 
its children depends, first, on how much money it spends; and, second, on whether 
or not it uses each dollar appropriated so as to get the best and largest educational 
return. 
2. Bridgeport spends annually for public schools more than a third of a million 
dollars received from local taxes, State funds, and tuition fees. 
3. Bridgeport spends $26.81 each year for the education of each school child, while 
the average for 11 other cities of similar size is $41.13. To put the Bridgeport schools 
on a par with those of the average city of like population would cost about $200,000 
additional per year. 
4. Bridgeport teachers receive lower salaries and teach larger classes than do these 
of any other city compared, which means that Bridgeport children receive cheaper 
teaching and less of it than the children of the other cities. 
5. Bridgeport spends less per child for every separate item of school expenditure 
than does the average city of like size, which means that Bridgeport children get a 
smaller quantity or a lower quality of every sort of educational opportunity than do the 
children of the other cities. 
6. Bridgeport citizens spend less per capita for city support than do those of any 
other city of similar size save one, but they spend less for their public schools than do 
the citizens of any other city compared. 
 
-P-A-G-E-571
        SCHOOL SURVEYS. 535 
7. The particular items in which the Bridgeport expenditures are most deficient, 
when compared with those of other cities, are the support of the business office of the 
board of education, the purchase of stationery and supplies, the payment of janitors, 
the support of the superintendent’s office, and the purchase of textbooks. 
8. Among the 168 towns and cities of Connecticut, Bridgeport ranks second, third, 
and fourth in seven comparisons of educational resources, and one hundred and fifty- 
third and one hundred and fifty-fourth in two comparisons of educational expenditures. 
Differentiation of Functions, Supervision, and Organization: 
1. All nominations of teachers should be made by the superintendent of schools. 
The board’s function here is to accept or reject. 
2. The supervision is notably insufficient in amount. Employ an assistant superin- 
tendent and at least one supervisor of primary work, and two assistant supervisors of 
drawing and handwork. 
3. Employ a stenographer and an additional clerk trained in statistical methods to 
conserve the time of the superintendent. 
4. Conserve the time of principals for supervision by relieving them of the book- 
keeping incident to the penny-savings system as now conducted. 
5. Carry further and make more systematic the grouping of upper grammar grades 
in centrally located buildings, and provide for differentiation of work in accordance 
with the needs of different groups of pupils. Conduct the instruction of these classes 
on the departmental plan. 
6. The schoolrooms are overcrowded, and they lack adequate teaching equipment. 
7. There are no rooms available in which to organize special classes for foreign-born, 
backward, and other exceptional children. 
8. The city now needs 32 additional rooms to take care of ordinary classes. To 
provide these rooms at once, and in addition provide for further needs, involves too 
great a charge upon the resources of a single year. Future generations may properly 
be allowed to share the cost of improvements as permanent as schoolhouses. 
9. According to generally accepted standards, too few children in the elementary 
grades are making either rapid or normal progress. Both retardation and elimination 
are excessive. In the fifth grade 59 per cent of the pupils are over age, and 51 per cent 
of all pupils enrolled have left school before reaching the sixth grade. 
10. The schools are strong in drill processes, less strong in reasoning. 
11. It is questionable whether formal examinations should play so prominent a part 
in the promotion of pupils as they appear to do. 
12. The discipline of the schools is superior and the spirit of the teaching force not- 
ably good. 
13. A higher maximum salary for teachers, if awarded strictly on the basis of merit 
and not merely on length of service, would be a wise investment. 
The City Normal School: 
1, The normal school is seriously handicapped by lack of facilities of every kind. 
It needs more rooms, more teachers, more books and apparatus, and niore opportuni- 
ties for observation work and practice teaching. 
2. The entrance requirements are too easy. 
3. The local normal school should not furnish more than two-thirds of the teachers 
appointed annually. 
The High School: 
1. Many of the obvious weaknesses of the school on the educational side are direct 
consequences of the unsatisfactory physical conditions under which the work is being 
conducted. 
2. The discipline of the school is good. 
3. Too little money is expended on the school to give the boys and girls the educa- 
tional experiences to which they are entitled.
-P-A-G-E-572
  536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
4. Develop the present commercial course into a coherent four-year course and 
offer a short clerkship course. 
5. Greek is being taken by so few pupils that its retention involves an extravagant 
use of teacher time in view of the other needs of the school. 
6. Provide a two-year course in Latin open to pupils not going to college. 
7. Provide an industriai department with a full four-year industrial course and a 
full four-year domestic-science course. Provide shorter courses for boys and girls 
who will leave at the age of 16. 
8. In cooperation with the bureau for granting work permits, arrange for vocational 
guidance. 
9. In the new high-school building provision should be made for the industrial 
department. 
10. The shops should be strictly industrial, both as to the arrangement of their 
equipment and the type of work done in them. 
Industrial Education—Guiding Principles: 
1. There is a certain minimum of general education which every individual ought 
to have in order that he may be an intelligent citizen and get a reasonable amount of 
satisfaction out of life. 
2. It is unreasonable to suppose that this necessary minimum of training can be 
given in less than six years of schooling. 
3. No essential part of this general education should be sacrificed in order to include 
training for industrial efficiency. 
4. After the general education has been taken care of, there should be provided 
for the boys in the last two or three years of the elementary school opportunities for 
training in a number of lines of practical work for the purpose of developing broad 
industrial intelligence, under the guidance of competent teachers, and to assist in 
the choosing of a life work. 
5. General education for girls should be supplemented in the last two or three years 
of the elementary school by opportunities corresponding to those proposed for boys 
and by practical training in cooking, sewing, dressmaking, millinery, marketing, 
keeping of household accounts, sanitation, and hygiene, for the purpose of helping them 
‘to an understanding of the principles of home making. 
6. After the completion of the general education, there should be provided oppor- 
tunities for practical industrial courses, closely related to the activities of the com- 
munity, open to those boys and girls who elect to take them, which will increase the 
general industrial intelligence and efficiency of those who must become wage earners 
at the earliest possible time. 
7. The methods and processes employed in industrial courses should be organized 
about the making of useful projects, rather than abstract exercises which result in a 
mere waste of material of scrap. 
8. The products resulting from the industrial activities of the school shops, while 
useful, should not be such as to involve unfair competition with the industries of the 
communities. 
9. So far as practicable, the products of the school shop may be those classes of 
articles of equipment and supplies required for use in the school system itself, and 
articles which are not produced in the community. 
10. The different lines of industrial work should be taught by teachers who are 
themselves skilled workers in the processes to be taught. 
11. The programs of the industrial courses should be based on a study of the require- 
ments of the pupils to be taught. Careful experimentation in various cities seems to 
have demonstrated that a six-hour day produces the most efficient results for pupils 
of 14 to 16 years of age. 
12. The classes Should be small enough to make efficient instruction possible in 
complete processes from raw materials to finished product. 
 
-P-A-G-E-573
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 537 
18. The industrial courses should be controlled, under the authority and direction 
of the board of education, by advisory committees which should contain equal repre- 
sentation of wage earners and employers in the industries concerned. 
14. The board of education should employ a trained expert to organize and direct 
the entire scheme of manual training, household training, and industrial courses, and 
give him sufficient freedom to develop the work. 
15. Nothing should be done that will result in diminishing the facilities and oppor- 
tunities now existing for those boys and girls who desire to continue in a course of 
general education in order to prepare for high school, college, technical or professional 
school, etc. Rather, these facilities should be extended and improved in every way 
possible, and made available for an increasing number of individuals. The school 
system must provide opportunities for all boys and girls who are qualified, and have 
the ambition, to pursue higher courses in professional training that are equal in every 
respect to those provided for industrial education. 
16. A careful study should be made of local conditions, and a modest beginning 
made in those directions where the needs seem to be most immediate and pressing, 
subsequent expansion being based on continued study and experimentation. 
17. Provision should be made of opportunities for supplemental instruction in 
general education, or industrial education, or both, for workers already engaged in 
the industries. 
Course of Study, Geography, History, Arithmetic, ete.: 
1. If the directions in the course of study were expanded into a syllabus of each 
subject, and the requirements under each grade stated under subject headings rather 
than by pages in the textbooks, it would have added usefulness. 
2. The division of the time allotted to given studies between study and recitation 
has much to commend it. 
3. The work in geography deserves special commendation. 
4, The work in history and citizenship ought to receive the same earnest attention 
that has made the work in geography so satisfactory. 
5. In arithmetic the emphasis is rightly placed on fundamental operations and 
intelligent solution of problems. Bridgeport pupils who complete the sixth grade 
take high rank in this subject. 
6. It would be well to make a careful study of the effect of the relatively high 
requirements in arithmetic upon promotion, particularly in the lower grades. 
English: 
1. The work in English lacks unity. Spelling, punctuation, and technical grammar 
are taught as ends in themselves, not as aids to self-expression. 
2. The course of study in English is indefinite and general. Technical grammar is 
given more time than composition. 
3. Reading is taught in a uniform manner. throughout the system. The method 
used is, for the greater part, based upon a knowledge and use of phonetics. Objective 
teaching is thus neglected. The same texts are used in the schools composed of 
foreigners as in those attended by Americans. 
4. There is little uniformity in the teaching of oral composition. This work, 
however, is admirably done in some schools. 
5. Little emphasis is given to plan work. As a result the compositions often show 
an illogical arrangement of thoughts and a slight feeling for the relative value of ideas. 
6. The penmanship, as a whole, is fairly satisfactory. 
7. There is no course in English literature and composition offered in the normal 
school. e 
8. The work in each grade should be unified with English as a basis. Spelling, 
punctuation, phonetics, and technical grammar should always be taught as aids to 
self-expression, not as an end in themselves. 
   
-P-A-G-E-574
  - 538 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
9. Revise the course of study in English, giving definite and detailed directions for 
the teaching of composition. Give more emphasis to composition teaching, less to 
technical grammar. 
10. Give language lessons preparatory to reading. Depend less upon the pho- 
netics and more upon connecting the printed text with the thought to be conveyed 
by the reader. Use in the schools composed: almost entirely of doris texts 
expressly prepared for the language training of such children. 
11. Emphasize oral composition. Train the children, in all work, to talk in para- 
graph units. Use this oral work as an immediate eae ad for written composition. 
12. Have the children make outlines before attempting any oral and written com- 
position work. This should develop a logical arrangement of thought and a greater 
feeling for the relative value of ideas. 
13. A course in English literature and composition should be offered in the normal 
school to give the pupil-teachers a broad, thorough training in English. Such a 
course would enable them later to do original and progressive work in the grades. 
ST. PAUL, MINN. 
On March 4, 1913, Mr. A. N. Farmer presented his full report of 
“a six-day survey,’ made by the Bureau of Municipal Research of 
New York City at the request of the committee of thirty re need of 
St. Paul’s public schools, conducted in the preceding month. The 
scope of the inquiry was limited to the following four questions: 
Is the central office organization adequate? 
Are the financial records adequate? 
Are the educational records adequate? 
Is the teaching observed in 40 classes efficient? 
The full report was published in the local newspapers. The report 
on classroom instruction in St. Paul’s elementary schools forms 16 
pages (pp. 17-32) of a separate bulletin on the Waterbury and St. 
Paul inquiries in the series of Help-Your-School Surveys. Observa- 
tions as to classroom instruction were made in music, reading, 
language and composition, grammar, spelling, arithmetic, geography, 
and history. The findings were as follows: 
In 23 of the 54 classes visited the instruction was excellent: 8 in reading; 5 in 
geography and history; 4 in arithmetic; 2 in music; 1 in manners, phonics, language; 
and 1 kindergarten class. 
In 31 of the 54 classes the teachers showed the need for helpful and sympathetic 
supervision; 12 in reading; 7 in arithmetic; 4 in grammar; 4 in geography and history; 
2 in language; 1 in spelling; and 1 in drawing. 
Of 31 teachers whose work showed the need for supervision and direction, 24 pro- 
tested that they were not to blame for existing conditions, and raised objections to 
(a) the textbooks supplied for reading classes and the lack of supplementary material; 
(6) the failure to require systematic instruction in phonics; (c) the course of study in 
grammar and the course of study in spelling; (d) the textbook and course of study in 
arithmetic. 
In at least 30 of 54 classes visited the subject matter of the textbooks was dull, 
deadening, and without interest to pupils. 
In 45 of 54 classes, teachers took a moment or two to open windows and gave pupils 
a sharp gymnastic drill. The beneficial results were evident.

  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 539 
In two rooms some children could reach the floor with their feet when sitting. In 
not a single room visited were seats properly adjusted to all pupils. 
The finish of walls in all buildings visited was a dark green. This decreased the 
light, especially in rooms where the lighting area of windows was far too small to 
properly light the rooms. 
In six of eight buildings it was found that children clean all erasers and blackboards, 
The pounding together of erasers is unhealthful and insanitary, and results in chil- 
dren’s breathing not a little of the chalk dust. 
In 30 rooms blackboards were found in a most untidy condition, partly due to poor 
cleaning and partly to negligence and carelessness in erasing written work. 
In but 6 out of 38 recitations in which the use of blackboards was necessary to get 
the best results were the blackboards used. In two rooms most of the blackboard was 
so covered up it could not be used. In one room the principal explained that he 
did not like to insist on clearing the boards because it would hurt the teacher’s 
feelings. 
The records showed that since September, 1912, and up to February 14, 1913, every 
school in the city had been visited by the superintendent once and a second visit had 
been made to most schools. In all, over 100 visits had been made. The record shows 
unusual energy in visiting on the part of a superintendent. 
In two of the buildings visited meetings of principal and all teachers are held 
regularly and are made the occasions for carefully going over school problems that all 
teachers are interested in, Meetings with groups of teachers having common problems 
are held as frequently as needed, and ‘“‘experience” meetings are held every six 
weeks, when each teacher relates facts that show defects in instruction and discipline, 
These are considered and discussed. Frequent conferences with individual teachers 
are held by the principal to work over special problems. 
WATERBURY, CONN. 
A three-day survey in February, 1913, was made of the Waterbury 
schools by Dr. Horace L. Brittain, of the New York City Bureau of 
Municipal Research. 
It was included at the request of a committee of business men as 
part of an investigation of the organization and business procedure 
of all city departments—financial methods, departments of police, 
fire, health, charities, water parks, public works, public library, 
clerks, inspector of buildings, etc.—which was submitted by the 
bureau April 16, 1913. The summary appeared in the local papers, 
and is reprinted in the pamphlet referred to under St. Paul (pp. 2-16). 
The summary is presented under four divisions: Conditions favor- 
able to efficiency; defective conditions easily corrected by slight 
improvements in administration herewith suggested; defective con- 
ditions easily corrected with suggestions for reorganization for which 
Statutory enactment is necessary; defective conditions easily cor- 
"rected but requiring increased appropriation, with constructive 
‘suggestions. The first of these topics details observations made on 
administration, construction and sanitation, textbooks and course 
,of study, and outside cooperation.

  540 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
NEW YORK CITY. 
The most extensive and notable school survey is that which was 
made of the schools of New York City. Few have realized that this 
survey was planned and authorized before the first study mentioned 
in this list was undertaken. Its conception, progress, and results 
are therefore most important. The initial resolution establishing 
the committee on school inquiry was adopted by the board of esti- 
mate and apportionment on October 26, 1910. Owing to the magni- 
tude of the undertaking, the report on the educational aspects of the 
inquiry, which was begun on June 1, 1911, was not submitted by 
Prof. Hanus until July 1, 1912. Owing also to various uncertain- 
ties incidental to the progress of the whole undertaking, the final 
report of the committee was not made until May 29, 1913. How- 
ever, the Goodnow-Howe report was submitted on May 31, 1913; 
the Baskerville-Winslow on July 1, 1913; the joint Armstrong-Knox 
report on July 24, 1913. 
The origin of the inquiry is to be found in the difficulties, extending 
over several years, encountered in adjusting the estimates of the 
board of education for additional sites, buildings, and teachers. 
The report states: 
During the budget hearings of October, 1910, it became evident that the board of 
education did not have proper evidence at hand to show the need for funds requested 
in the budget estimate and had not formulated the budget requests with any well- 
coordinated program in mind. Accordingly, the board of estimate and apportion- 
ment adopted the following resolution: 
“Resolved, That a committee of three members of the board of estimate be appointed 
by the mayor to conduct an inquiry into the organization, equipment, and methods, 
both financial and educational, of the department of education, including such plans 
and proposals as may have been formulated or may be under consideration by the 
board of education for extending and developing its educational activities, and that 
for this purpose the committee be authorized to associate with it such experts within 
and without the government of the city of New York as may assist it in the conduct 
of this inquiry and in the formulation of recommendations of this board, and that it 
be further authorized to employ such assistants as it may find necessary for the pur- 
poses of this inquiry.” 
The committee on school inquiry included John Purroy Mitchel, 
president of the board of aldermen; William A. Prendergast, comp- 
troller; and Cyrus C. Miller, president of the Borough of The Bronx, 
Prof. Paul H. Hanus, of Harvard University, was engaged to take 
general charge of the educational aspects of the inquiry. He was 
given the privilege of nominating his own assistants, all of whom 
received the approval of the committee. These 11 specialists, with 
the field work assigned to each, were as follows: 
Frank P. Bachman, assistant superintendent of schools, Cleveland, Ohio—Statis- 
tical studies pertaining to the need of elementary school-teachers, promotions, and 
part-time intermediate schools; Edward C. Elliott, professor of education, University 
of Wisconsin—Organization and methods of the supervisory staff, including the board

of superintendents, district superintendents, directors of special branches, board of 
examiners; Frank M. McMurry, professor of elementary education, Teachers College, 
Columbia University—Teachers and teaching in the elementary schools, together with 
the supervision of their schools by the principals, and elementary school course of 
study; Jesse D. Burke, director of the Bureau of Municipal Research, Philadelphia— 
Compulsory attendance service; Herman Schneider, dean of the college of engineer- 
ing, University of Cincinnati—Vocational schools; Frank W. Ballou, director of school 
affiliation and assistant professor of education, University of Cincinnati—High schools, 
organization and administration; Ernest C. Moore, professor of education, Yale Uni- 
versity—Board of education and local school boards; Calvin O. Davis, assistant 
professor of education, University of Michigan, and inspector of high schools—High- 
school courses of study (except commercial courses); Frank V. Thompson, assistant 
superintendent of schools, Boston, Mass.—High school of commerce, commercial high 
school, and commercial courses in high schools; Henry H. Goddard, director depart- 
ment of psychological research, New Jersey Training School for Feeble-Minded Boys 
and Girls—Ungraded classes; Stuart A. Courtis, head of department of science and 
mathematics, Detroit Home and Day School, Detroit—The Courtis tests in arithmetic 
for about 30,000 children in the 4A-8B grades of the elementary schools and in at 
least one high school. 
The committee’s work included also an inquiry into the condition 
of the school plant and the business system and accounts of the 
board of education. The following were the specialists and their 
respective studies: 
William H. West, chartered accountant—Organization of the office of the secretary, 
and the organization and work of the bureau of audit and accounts, department of 
education; Marvyn Scudder, accountant—Investigation of complaints and the bureau 
of supplies of the board of education; E. W. Stewart, accountant—Janitorial com- 
pensation, and accounting methods of the bureau of supplies; W. A. Averill, inves- 
tigator of the Bureau of Municipal Research—Organization and filing methods of the 
office of the city superintendent and board of associate city superintendents; Charles 
G. Armstrong, consulting engineer—The condition and efficiency of public-school 
buildings; Dr. Frederic C. Howe, director of the People’s Institute—The degree of 
utilization of the school buildings and plants; Prof. Charles Baskerville and Prof. 
C. E. H. Winslow, of the College of the City of New York—The air of New York City 
schools; joint investigation by Charles G. Armstrong and Francis J. Armstrong, con- 
sulting engineers, and William J. Knox, chemical engineer—The quality of air sup- 
plied to classrooms, and on the Baskerville-Winslow report; Charles G. Armstrong 
and Francis J. Armstrong—Delays in the location, design, and construction of New 
York public schools. 
The committee on inquiry filed with the board of estimate and 
apportionment on October 1, 1912, a special report stating the reasons 
for recommending the rejection of the report of Ernest C. Moore 
(vol. 3,.457-604).!. In lieu of this report the committee secured the 
services of the following specialists on the subjects named: 
Frank J. Goodnow, professor of administrative law, Columbia University, and 
Frederic ©. Howe, director of the People’s Institute—Joint report on the organization, 
status, and proceedings of the department of education, city of New York. 
  
1 With the omission of the last chapter, the rejected report was printed in the (NV. Y) City Record. It 
has been published in full, with the title “How New York City Administers its Schools: A Constructive 
Study,” World Book Co., 1913, as the first volume of the School Efficiency Series, edited by Prof. Hanus,

542 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The final and complete report of all the investigations under the 
committee of school inquiry was published in 1913. It comprises 
three volumes aggregating 2,573 pages. The total number of days’ 
work on both the educational and the business and administrative 
branches aggregated 6,567.37 days. The total cost of the investiga- 
tions was $95,131. (Including items not listed in the report (vol. 1, 
p. 64), it is said the final cost aggregated about $125,000.) 
The method and scope of the educational investigation as summa- 
rized by Prof. Hanus (vol. 1, pp. 132-133) were based upon the follow- 
ing principles, stated in the plan adopted and approved by the com- 
mittee on July 10, 1912: 
1. The scope of the inquiry as a whole, and in its details, must be restricted to what 
is reasonable to expect can be accomplished in the time and with the staff at our dis- 
posal, (This principle does not exclude, however, the definition or statement of 
problems to be solved by further investigation. Such problems are, indeed, peren- 
nial; and the report states many of them and suggests the procedure for their progres- 
sive solution). 
2. Within the limits thus set we should endeavor to obtain as satisfactory answers as 
possible to the following questions: 
(a) What instruction does the public school system of New York City provide, and 
is this instruction commensurate with the educational needs of the city in respect to 
(1) scope (2) quality (3) adjustment to individual needs (4) adjustment to social (in- 
cluding vocational) needs? 
(6) (1) Do the technical administration and supervision show professional insight 
and helpful leadership within and without the school system? (2) Do they actively 
encourage and promote the professional growth and practical efficiency of the teaching 
force? 
(c) Is the admission of competent and otherwise satisfactory new members of the 
teaching and supervisory staff properly safeguarded? 
(d) Are the general organization and administration of the school system such as to 
promote the satisfactory discharge of the city’s educational responsibility by the 
: board of education and the local school boards? 
(e) Further and in general: (1) Do initiative and cooperation under leadership, or 
do their opposites—passive conformity to instruction from above on the part of teachers, 
bureaucratic and chiefly authoritative control by the supervisory staff, and purely 
authoritative or arbitrary general direction and control by the board of education— 
prevail throughout the school system, and are the results of educational experience so 
gathered and used as to become effective guides for future effort? (2) Is there satis- 
factory provision for disinterested and adequate appraisal of results achieved, includ- 
ing experimental tests, to confirm or refute educational opinion within and without 
the school system? 
As stated in the introduction to the report, the purpose of the inquiry was construc- 
tive throughout. We have not failed to appreciate the merits of the school system, 
and they are many; but since our chief purpose was constructive criticism, we have 
devoted ourselves more particularly to such defects as we have been able to point out, 
and to suggestions and recommendations for removing or minimizing them. 
The method of the inquiry has been statistical, inspectorial (personal inspection by 
members of the stafi), comparative (comparisons of New York City’s schools and school 
system with those of other cities), and experimental so far as reliable experimental or 
scientific methods are available in education and could be employed; and we have 
 
-P-A-G-E-579
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 543 
made much use of conferences with officials and members of the teaching and super- 
visory staff. 
This method throughout aimed to ascertain the facts we needed for the purpose in 
hand, and to verify the facts and conclusions based on them so far as our time and 
opportunity permitted. We have been particularly careful not to make statements 
unsupported by facts where facts were needed; and we consistently objected, in spite 
of considerable pressure from without during the first months of the inquiry, to issue 
statements of findings, because we had not yet done all we could to assure ourselves of 
their validity. Moreover, we had no interest in setting forth defects in the school 
system until we were ready to make the constructive suggestions that we aimed at, 
and such suggestions (recommendations) could only be ready near or at the end of-our 
work. 
Our method also aimed at the cooperation of officers of the board of education and of 
the supervisory and teaching force in getting facts and in reaching and verifying con- 
clusions; and, as stated in the introduction to the report, it is a pleasure to say that the 
attitude of the entire staff was, throughout the period of the inquiry, courteous, re- 
sponsive, and helpful. 
The scope of both the educational and administrative investi- 
gations is briefly indicated above in the list of special topics and 
problems assigned to the specialists, respectively. The findings and 
recommendations are extensively distributed throughout the entire 
report. In their most condensed statements these aggregate 175 
pages, including the summary of Prof. Hanus ‘‘in the report as a 
whole.” 
The committee on school inquiry itself{— 
summarized the main conclusions and constructive suggestions upon which its inves- 
tigators are in general accord. In presenting this summary the committee wishes it 
clearly understood that it is not in a position to pass final judgment upon the worth of 
those recommendations which deal with problems requiring treatment at the hands of 
those qualified by academic training and practical experience. They are listed herein 
in their logical order and in brief and conclusive form. All the suggestions which deal 
mainly with educational matters have financial significance. The more obvious facts 
of financial import are pointed out by the committee under the appropriate heads. 
1. The course of study in all schools should be organized around human problems 
and made simple and elastic enough to permit of differentiation to meet the needs of 
different nationalities and groups. 
2. The content of the course of study should be made as practical as possible, and 
special attention should be given to the development of commercial, industrial, and 
vocational subjects, emphasizing the larger and more important aspects of industrial 
and commercial activities. 
3. The board of education should take necessary steps to effect the gradual elimina- 
tion of teachers of special branches. 
4, Each school as a neighborhood center should ally itself with neighborhood inter- 
ests and take cognizance of local needs. 
5. The board of education should make a careful investigation to ascertain whether 
cosmopolitan or composite high schools offering several different courses of study, or, 
small high schools with differentiated curricula, should be developed. 
6. The board of education through the proposed bureau of investigation and ap- 
praisal or other bureau, should establish a fact basis for its educational, administrative, 
and financial work. 
   
-P-A-G-E-580
544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
7. The board of education’s attendance department should adjust its work so as to 
maintain discipline and control school attendance without resorting to police methods 
in checking truancy. 
8. The educational administrative work of the department of education should be 
reorganized. 
9. The board of education should carefully supervise the operation of heating and 
ventilating systems installed in the different public school buildings. 
10. A comprehensive plan should be worked out for the wider use of school build- 
ings for purposes of recreation, for public assemblage, and for civic and social gatherings. 
11. The different administrative departments and bureaus of the department of 
education should be reorganized. 
12. The accounting system of the board of education should be so adjusted as to 
make possible the fullest segregation of disbursement accounts along functional lines 
properly correlated with allied statistics, and their publication at least quarterly. 
13. The board of education should provide for the collection and tabulation of all 
current data needed in order to enable it to know in advance what additional seating 
capacity is actually required throughout the city. : 
14, The permanent census board should be utilized by the board of education and 
should eventually be transferred to the board of education. 
15. The board of education should be reorganized and its membership reduced from. 
46 to 8, with 16 votes as now distributed in the board of estimate and apportionment.!   
1A digest of the New York schoolinquiry was submitted to the New York Board of Education on July 17, 
1913, by the Bureau of Municipal Research. In the printed report of this material (84 pp.) a summary of 
the findings and recommendations is offered. For the educational part of the survey this includes: 
20 rediscoveries for New York’s public schools, by the school inquiry and school board. 
70 features of the New York schools were praised by 12 investigators. 
57 defects were found in the method of examining and rating teachers and principals. 
20 defects were found in the wasting of time of superintendents. 
58 defects were found in the activity and supervision of elementary teachers. 
10 defects were found in the age-grade reports. 
59 defects were found in the reports on nonpromotion. 8 defects were found in the method used in estimating elementary teachers needed. 
21 defects were found in the handling of truancy. 
24 defects were found in the ungraded classes for feeble-minded. 
28 defects were found in the teaching of arithmetic. 
47 defects were found in the administration of high schools. 
13. defects were found in the high-school course of study. 
24 defects made commercial courses ineffective. 
15 defects were found in trade and night schools. 
27 defects were found in the methods of running buildings. 15 defects were found in the method of building construction. 
7 defects were found in overheating in some schools. 
221 recommendations are noted, of which— 
55 clearly require additional money. 
22 are intended to save money. 137 per se neither add nor save money. 
7 require State legislation. 38 further investigations were said to be necessary by 10 of the investigators. 
35 subjects, not covered by the school inquiry were reported as suggested for investigation by teachers, 
principals, and parents through the school edition of The Globe. 
Similar treatment of the Goodnow-Howe report presents the following: 
19 features in the administration, legal and financial, were praised. 139 defects in the organization were pointed out as needing correction. 61 recommendations were named in this report, of which— 15 clearly required additional money. 28 neither directly add nor save money, but are intended to increase efficiency. 
7 were intended to save money. 11 require State legislation. 
On September 1, 1914, a committee of eight district superintendents, of which William L. Ettinger was 
chairman and Joseph 8. Taylor secretary, published “The reply of the association of district superinten- 
dents of New York to certain findings and recommendations of Prof. Frank N. McMurry and Prof. Edward 
C. Elliott” (116 pp.). This committee summarizes its discussion and reply in 29 statements (pp. 11-17), 
concluding with this statement: “The whole inquiry with reference to the teaching and supervision of 
elementary schools is a set of opinions backed by guesses and assumptions.”

NEWBURGH, N. Y. 
In June, 1913, the department of surveys and exhibits of the 
Russell Sage Foundation made its “Report of limited investigations 
of social conditions in Newburgh, N. Y.’’ These were undertaken 
at the request of the citizens and conducted under the general 
direction of Zenas L. Potter. Nine features of the civic life and 
organization were studied as follows: Public schools, public health, 
housing, delinquency, public library, recreation, charities, industrial 
conditions, and municipal administration. In the report (104 pp.) the 
section on public schools comprises 16 pages (5-20). As the purpose 
of the general survey was constructive, the attention given to the 
schools sought to find as much good as possible. The opportunities 
for improvement in the schools were found to be as follows: 
1. Improvement of the physical provisions for children in the way of lighting, air 
space, ventilation, cloak rooms, toilet facilities, and fire protection in old buildings. 
2. Placing the detailed work of school administration more largely in the hands of 
the superintendent. 
3. More frequent and adequate advising with the teachers regarding textbooks, 
changes in the curriculum, daily and term programs, etc., and at the same time, 
more thorough oversight of their work. 
4. Increasing teachers’ salaries, and adopting better methods for their selection 
and promotion, and for studying and improving their efficiency. 
5. Making continuous studies of school efficiency for the purpose of locating and 
correcting weaknesses in the system. 
6. Making special provision for mentally and physically abnormal children. 
7. Establishing evening schools for foreigners and others who need special 
opportunities. 
8. Greater provision for the physical training of children. 
9. Opening school buildings out of school hours for wider civic and social uses. 
The study, while confessedly limited, uses to advantage the com- 
parative method of presenting certain features of the Newburgh 
schools with those of cities of approximately the same size. 
GRAFTON, W. VA. 
At the request of the board of education of Grafton, W. Va., 
a study of its schools and their supervision was made by Prof. J. N. 
Deahl, of West Virginia University, Supt. Joseph Rosier, of the 
Fairmont city schools, and Supt. Otis G. Wilson, of the Elkins city 
schools. The arrangement for the survey was made in April and 
the report was presented June 14, 1913. The report (29 pp.) was 
published as ‘‘The report of the survey of the Grafton city schools, 
by the West Virginia State department of free schools.” The aim of 
the survey was suggestive rather than final with respect to utilizing 
the school funds in such a way as to provide for the city’s needs to 
the best advantage. 
The points studied included the following: The educational 
needs of the community from an industrial standpoint; the profes- 
73226°—xp 1914—vor 1——35  
-P-A-G-E-582
546 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
sional training and equipment of the teachers in service; the course 
of study followed in the schools; the methods of teaching; the 
possibilities of consolidation of departments and grades; the assign- 
ment of teachers and size of class; high-school equipment; current 
expenses; and the purchase of supplies. 
This study of schools is especially interesting because it was 
focused on local needs; as in the Bridgeport study, emphasis was 
placed on the industrial needs of the community. In addition to 
recommending the cooperative industrial courses and the formation 
of night classes for the children employed in factories, the results 
of the study suggested that the organization of grades below the 
high school be modified to make the average size class per teacher 
between 30 and 40 pupils. The economy thus practiced would pro- 
vide for the addition of instruction in manual training and domestic 
science. It was also found that too much time was given to the 
formal study of arithmetic, geography, nature study, history, and 
physiology. The following time allotments in the sixth and seventh 
grades were suggested: 
1, Language (including reading, writing, spelling, composition, English grammar, 
and literature), one-fourth. 
2. Mathematics (including arithmetic, oral and mental), one-eighth. 
8. Elementary science (including nature study, physiology, hygiene, and geog- 
raphy), three-sixteenths. 
4, History (including civil government, biography, and history proper), one-eighth. 
5, Miscellaneous exercises (including music, drawing, industrial training, physical 
exercises, and recesses for games), five-sixteenths. 
The high-school situation leads to the following recommendations: 
1. Of the 16 units necessary for graduation, English should be required. Beyond 
this there should be only a reasonable grouping of studies, such as two majors of not 
fewer than three units each and three minors of not fewer than’two units each. 
2. In English the amount of technical grammar and language study should be 
reduced and the history of literature should be omitted except for a reasonable under- 
standing of the selections studied by the pupils. 
3. In mathematics a more modern text should be used in algebra and a briefer text 
in geometry. Plane geometry should doubtless be offered for those in the high school 
who desire it. In the eighth grade the elements of algebra without a textbook should 
be taught in connection with the arithmetic. This can be done so as to improve the 
latter and serve as a basis for further study of mathematics in the high schools. 
4, The commercial studies should be bookkeeping, shorthand, and typewriting. 
Aminimum speed test should be fixed in stenography for those who take it. Sopho- 
more standing should be required for admission to these studies. 
5. The high school should offer mechanical drawing, for which preparation should be 
made in the grades with free-hand drawing. 
6. Home economics for girls (including domestic science, etc.) and manual training 
for boys (consisting of wood and metal work) should be provided for in the high school, 
7. The city has an opportunity to do cooperative work of shop and school, thus 
opening the possibilities of secondary education to many boys who are now not receiv- 
ing this benefit. 
8. There are both educational advantages and economy in furnishing free textbooks.

SCHOOL SURVEYS. 547 
UPPER PENINSULA, MICH. 
An early instance of a cooperative school survey is to be found 
in the report of the bureau of research of the Upper Peninsula (Mich.) 
Educational Association, presented September 1, 19138. By resolu- 
tion on October 4, 1912, the association established a bureau of 
research, to consist of a committee of five and a permanent secretary, 
who is Prof. Gilbert L. Brown, Northern State Normal, Marquette, 
Mich. President James H. Kaye, of the same normal school, was 
made chairman. The committee and secretary serve without pay, 
but an appropriation of $200 was made to meet necessary printing, 
postage, and other expenses. The resolution directed— 
That the work of the bureau for the ensuing year be to make an educational survey 
of the Upper Peninsula to discover the problems, with a view to solving these problems. 
Speaking generally, the teachers, superintendents, and commissioners cooperated 
admirably with the bureau in making the survey; 1,412 teachers, 24 superintendents, 
and 7 commissioners reported. Although only 7 commissioners returned their special 
reports, complete or partial returns were received from 12 of the 15 counties, exclusive 
of cities and villages. 
The bureau experienced considerable difficulty in studying the reports received 
from some of the teachers, because of omissions or inaccuracies. 
The report (48 pp.) is presented in three parts: Rural schools; 
city schools; high schools. The topics of Part I are: Preparation of 
the teacher; distribution of pupils per teacher; the distribution of 
the pupils of the rural schools among the grades; nationality; equip- 
ment and method; manual subjects in the rural schools. The topics 
of Part II are: Preparation of the teacher; the number of pupils per 
teacher; relative amount of time devoted to the different groups 
of subjects; subject matter in the elementary grades; equipment and 
method; nationalities; manual subjects in city and village schools; 
some of the newer problems in education. Part III presents: Require- 
ments for high-school graduation and length of service of teachers. 
It is found that the average length of time men and women follow 
the profession of teaching in the northern Peninsula is seven years; 
the period is considerably greater in the cities and villages than in 
the rural districts. 
Although suggestions are offered for the possible solution of a 
few of the more important problems, no definite recommendations are 
made. Among these suggestions are the following: 
The greatest need of the rural schools is such an organization into a system as will 
make supervision effective. 
The minimum preparation of the teachers should be two years in addition to high- 
school graduation. 
City and rural schools alike need to examine the course of study more critically 
and eliminate all that will not have a vital place in the life of the child. 
English should be taught through a utilization of all school subjects as a basis, rather 
than through literature. 
Greater emphasis in geography, arithmetic, physics, and nature study should be 
placed on actual processes and observation.

    548 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The Upper Peninsula has accomplished but very little in ‘‘the socialization of the 
community: through the school as a center,’’ and wider use of the school plant is sug- 
gested. 
The committee recommended that this report be followed up by a study of ‘the 
educational systems of the Upper Peninsula from the economic and social standpoints.” 
PORTLAND, OREG. 
On November 1, 1913, there was submitted to the taxpayers’ com- 
mittee the report of the survey of the public school system of School 
District No. 1, Multnomah County, Oreg. (city of Portiand). The 
study was authorized at the regular annual meeting of the voters of 
the district held on December 27, 1912. The aim and scope of the 
investigation appear in a preamble of the resolution appropriating 
$7,500 to meet the expenses of the investigation: 
It is of the utmost importance that the public schools should be kept at the highest 
point of efficiency, [and] it is hereby declared to be the sense of this meeting that a full 
and complete survey be made of the public school system of this district, comprising: 
1. The location, type, character, and condition of existing schoolhouses, and the 
estimated cost and type of future buildings; 
2. Of the organization and methods of administration; 
8. Of the form and manner of instruction; 
4, The courses of study and the quality of the textbooks; 
5. The extent and need of playgrounds and gymnasiums; 
6. The development of domestic science, manual training, trade, agricultural, and 
horticultural schools; 
7. The salaries of teachers and other employees; 
8. The method and system of accounting; 
9. The form of organization and the examination of the school laws of the State as 
applied in this district; 
10. Of the average cost per pupil in comparison with other cities; and 
11. Of the scientific method of raising the required revenue, either by direct taxa- 
tion or the issuance of bonds, or both. 
The survey staff was organized by the director, each member study- 
ing the topics named herewith: 
Director Ellwood P. Cubberley, professor of education, Leland Stanford Junior Uni- 
versity—Organization, administration, teaching force, costs; Fletcher B. Dresslar, 
professor of education, Peabody College for Teachers—Schoolhouse construction, sani- 
tation; Edward ©. Elliott, professor of education, University of Wisconsin—A ttend- 
ance, census reports; J. H. Francis, superintendent of schools, Los Angeles—Vocational 
and special education; Frank E. Spaulding, superintendent of schools, Newton, 
Mass.—Courses of instruction; Lewis M. Terman, associate professor of education, 
Leland Stanford Junior University—Health supervision, physical training; William 
R. Tanner, graduate student, Leland Stanford Junior University, assistant for statis- 
tical work. 
The field work conducted by the different members of the survey 
staff and under the constant direction of the director extended from 
April 6 until the first week in June, 1913. The formulation of the 
report occupied the months of June and July, the letter of transmissal 
to the chairman of the taxpayers’ committee bearing date August 20, 
1913. :

The report is presented precisely as it came from the authors, the understanding 
from the first having been that it would be submitted without editing, adding, or sup- 
pressing. 
In view of the time limit which made it impossible to visit every 
school and every teacher, the material was gathered chiefly by a 
study of ‘‘selected schools, typical of the different educational con- 
ditions found,” or, ‘‘of type forms of instruction.’’ The aim of the 
report was in no sense critical. 
On the contrary, we have tried, instead, to outline a constructive program for the 
improvement and development of your school system, and have used criticisms only 
as a basis upon which to build. Such criticisms as are made, too, it is hoped will not 
be taken as personal by anyone, as they describe a condition rather than individuals. 
In particular we do not wish the report to be taken in any sense as a personal criti- 
cism of the outgoing superintendent or of the board of school directors, as we feel that 
the city owes much to the very faithful services of both. Your school system, despite 
its defects, is still above the average in worth. 
The report (317 pp.) covers the following topics, arranged in the

550 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Because of its remarkable growth, Portland offers exceptional 
opportunities for bringing to light interesting data respecting the 
situation in city school systems as they occur in the newer as con- 
trasted with the older cities in the United States. The comparative 
method employed places Portland in a group of 37 cities whose range 
of population extended from 100,253 to 347,469 in 1910, Portland 
being the twenty-third in rank, with a population of 207,214. The 
estimate of the population shows Portland to have a preponderance 
of males and of unmarried people. It ranks second in the first 
| instance and thirty-sixth in the second. It has the lowest percentage 
of children in the population, ranking thirty-seventh of all the cities. 
In the matter of assessed and real wealth per capita, it ranks third 
from the top of the list. In the real rate of taxation for the mainte- 
nance of all city departments, including schools, it ranks second 
from the bottom of the list. It ranks nineteenth in the proportion 
of its city expenditure for education, which is $4.29 per capita of the 
total population. It ranks thirty-sixth in the cost for schools for 
each person in the total population 15 years of age or over, the 
amount being $5.28; and thirty-first in the cost for schools for each 
adult male, the amount being $10. With this unusually favorable 
showing from the financial point of view, Portland is in a position to 
maintain a more efficient system of education than was found by 
the survey staff. 
The findings and recommendations are stated in final form in the 
publication “The suggested law for the management of the school 
district.” Several of the chapters, such as 7, 9, and 11, are extended 
suggestions detailing at length all the features of what Portland might 
undertake. In other phases of the report, findings and reeommenda- 
tions are stated in detail, as “‘The 12 good rules of action on the 
selection of teachers” and “The 10 right principles of action on the 
tenure of teachers,” in chapter 3; and “The suggested plan for fixing 
the salary for teachers on a basis of merit and efficiency,” in chap- 
ter 5. 
The chief characteristics of the present system of elementary and 
secondary education are found to be those of— 
a rigidly prescribed mechanical system of instruction, organization, and administra- 
tion, poorly adapted both to the needs of the children and youth to be educated, 
and to the community to be provided with efficiently trained service. This mechan- 
ical system shows itself universally in the course of study, in the scheme of promo- 
tional examination, in the spirit and method of instruction, in the classrooms, in 
the attitude of principals, teachers, and pupils in the grammar grades. 
The following recommendations are made for a program adapted 
to local needs: 
An adequate educational program for the community must be based on the indi- 
vidual needs of the boys and girls to be educated, and the community needs for 
service.
-P-A-G-E-587
  
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 551 
Such a program does not cali for individual instruction to any considerable extent; 
it does call for the grouping of pupils into schools and classes in accordance with 
similarity of needs. 
Seven factors must be considered in determining adequate grouping of pupils for 
instruction: Maturity, most readily but only roughly indicated by age; knowledge 
and ability to learn and to do; probable time to be devoted to schooling; natural 
capacity and interest; command of the English language; marked defects, abnor- 
malities and subnormalities, physical and mental; and sex. 
The significance of age: Children under 6 are educable, and suitable provision 
should be made for them; children of a greater age range than 3 or 4 years can not 
be advantageously instructed in classes together (and) 10 per cent of the pupils in 
the elementary grades in Portland need reclassification on account of age alone; 
“over-age” is the resultant of one or more of a large number of diverse causes; all 
over-age pupils should be studied and suitable treatment applied; it is still more 
important to anticipate and prevent the development of over age pupils. 
As all public instruction should be designed to fit the recipient of it for largest 
usefulness, the time available for such instruction must be an important factor in 
determining what that instruction shall be. 
Ignorance of the English language is a handicap that calls for separate classification. 
and special instruction. 
Markedly abnormal and subnormal children should be segregated, both in their own 
interest and in the interest of normal children. 
The school population falls into four large fairly distinct groups, best represented 
under the names of the types of education best suited to the respective group needs: 
The kindergarten group; the elementary group; the intermediate group; and the 
secondary group. 
Courses of study must change. constantly to meet the ever-changing needs of pupils 
and to fit for the ever-varying service that society demands. 
Promotion must be based not on what a pupil has learned but on what he needs 
to learn. 
In vocational and practical education arts the following changes 
are recommended: 
Primary manual arts should be introduced into the first, second, and third grades, 
and the work in manual training in the upper grades made much less formal. 
Cooking should be introduced in the sixth, not later than the seventh, grade. 
The elementary course in sewing should be modified to include more garment 
making and less exercise work. 
The work in music and the training of the powers of expression need much ampli- 
fication. 
The board of school directors should assume full financial and educational respon- 
sibility for school gardening and place the work under an efficient supervisor, with 
sufficient help to carry it out. 
Five or more intermediate schools should be organized to cover the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth grade work. 
If the intermediate school plan is not adopted, freehand drawing in the seventh 
and eighth grades should specialize, to meet the needs of girls, in costume designing, 
home decorating and furnishing, pottery, and leather and metal work; and mechan- 
ical drawing should be offered to boys. The drawing in the high schools needs 
redirection and additional facilities for work. 
Vocational work for girls should receive a much greater expenditure of time, thought, 
and money than it now does. 
A vocational-guidance director should be appointed.  
-P-A-G-E-588
  552 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The commercial courses in the high schools need reorganizing and in particular 
need to be much more closely connected with the business life of the city. 
There should be a first-class agricultural high school, well provided for practical 
instruction. 
The Portland School of Trades should be merged into a technical high school, 
retaining the trade courses. 
The needed reorganizations and expansions of the school system 
are specified as follows: 
1. That the school system be reorganized, to secure greater educational efficiency, 
into the following units: Kindergarten, one year; elementary schools, six years; 
intermediate schools, three years; and high schools, five years (three or four years 
now; five ultimately). This can be made a truly American system, fitted to meet the 
social, professional, industrial, and commercial needs of American boys and girls. 
2. That ungraded rooms should be established in connection with each elementary 
school of any, size, to afford the necessary provision for the exceptional children in 
the school. 
3. Four or five special or truant schools for boys, irregular in their studies, habits, 
and deportment, should be established, graduating their boys into a central special 
manual school, from which they should be admitted to one of the high schools. 
4, The vacation-school system should be gradually enlarged and extended, and 
changed somewhat in type. The playgrounds should be closely connected with such 
school work. 
5. The night-school work should be enlarged, enriched, and materially extended 
in scope, and its purpose in part changed. 
6. The school day should be extended, and Saturday forenoon included for voca- 
tional work in grammar schools, carrying the seventh and eighth grades, and in the 
intermediate schools and in the high schools. 
7. Two special art schools, one for intermediate and one for high-school pupils, 
should be established. 
8. There should be established at least two, and gradually a number more, of neigh- 
borhood schools, to meet the peculiar needs of certain centers within the city. 
9. A school for the instruction of janitors should be added, standards for the work 
established, and a wage scale based on efficiency established. 
Medical inspection should be placed under the supervision of a full-time physician 
as chief director, aided by two full-time and two half-time physicians, one full-time 
dentist, and seven additional full-time nurses. Annual tests of vision and hearing 
should be made. Playgrounds should be increased in number and size, and a few 
open-air schools should be established at once. Mentally peculiar and defective 
children should be studied by psychologists. The more important aspects of the 
hygiene of instruction should receive attention. 
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN. 
Because of its specific recommendations which in part suggest a 
reorganization of the schools, mention should be made of “A yoca- 
tional survey of Minneapolis” which was published in 1913 by the 
Minneapolis Teachers’ Club. The commission of 18 “persons well 
known in the city, and representatives of differing interests,” even- 
tually depended upon the Minneapolis Teachers’ Club and the board 
of directors of Unity House for the completion of the inquiry. The 
completeness and accuracy of the report are regarded as due to the 
work of Misses Lydia Herrick and Emily Child.
-P-A-G-E-589
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 553 
The report (90 pages) includes 13 tables and other statistical mate- 
rial presenting school and industrial data concerning a group of 352 
children between the ages of 14 and 16 years who left school in 1907 
or 1908. 
The recommendations were as follows: 
1. That as rapidly as would be economical the schools be organized on the ‘‘six- 
three-and-three” plan, beginning differentiated courses in the B7 grade. These 
courses should follow three broad lines leading: (1) Toward the academic courses in 
high schools; (2) toward the commercial courses or directly to business; and (3) toward 
manual training in high school, or directly to manufacturing and mechanical pursuits. 
2. That preparation for-the trades can be best and most economically given in 
continuation schools, in which the instruction shall be closely related to working 
conditions, while the necessary skill shall be gained in actual work under the usual 
commercial conditions. 
3. That the membership of the Thomas Arnold School be enlarged to include all 
boys who have reached the age of 15 and have not yet reached the seventh grade. 
And that a similar school be organized for girls. 
4, That a department of vocational guidance be organized. It should attempt the 
following work: First, a survey of the business and industries of the city, giving accu- 
rate and complete information regarding the wages, hours of labor, chances of promo- 
tion, sanitation, and moral conditions of each occupation. Second, a survey to 
indicate clearly the value of the present courses of instruction in high school, not only 
the industrial and commercial courses, but every course in our schools; in this should 
be included a comparison with the product of business colleges and other schools, and 
the opinions of employers regarding the qualifications of the young persons in their 
employ. Third, vocational guidance, which shall assist a child with his parent to 
find his proper place at work; establish a bureau of information for employers and 
those seeking employment; at its discretion, within the law, issue all labor permits 
and have general oversight of the boys and girls at work. 
5. That aset of records be kept of each pupil, giving a complete account of his home 
conditions, his physical condition, and his mental and emotional characteristics, upon 
which information may be based a judgment concerning his future occupation. 
6. That as an adjunct to the board of education an advisory commission of 15 mem- 
bers, composed of employees, employers, and educators be established, whose duty 
it shall be to report changes in the demands of business and industry, and to advise 
modifications of the course of study to meet these new demands. 
7. That a law should be enacted, making it mandatory that a boy shall be either 
in school or at work up to his eighteenth year, and that the department of vocational 
guidance be charged with the duty of enforcing such a provision. 
8. That a school census be taken of the city, the purpose being that all children 
of school age shall be in school, and that the board of education may have the benefit 
of this information in planning for the future of the city’s school system. 
9. That an age-grade census of all pupils in school be taken, to determine where 
retardation is taking place; this should be followed by a study of conditions in order 
to remove the causes of retardation. 
STATE OF OHIO. 
The most extensive school survey conducted on the cooperative 
plan is that which was reported in January, 1914, to the governor of 
Ohio by the Ohio State school survey commission. On February 
   
-P-A-G-E-590
    554 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
26, 1913, the General Assembly of Ohio passed an act authorizing 
the governor— 
to appoint a commission of three members to make a survey of the public schools, the 
normal schools, and the agricultural schools of the State, and the State administration 
of the same, to determine with what efficiency they are being conducted, and to report 
to the governor with recommendations. Such report shall be transmitted by the 
governor to the present General Assembly of Ohio. 
An appropriation of $10,000 was made to meet the necessary 
expenses of the members of this unpaid commission which included 
M. Edith Campbell, William L. Allendorf, and Oliver J. Thatcher, 
chairman. The commission secured (without cost to the State) 
Horace L. Brittain, of the New York training school for public service 
of the Municipal Research Bureau, as director of the survey. The 
commission began its work March 12, 1913, and presented its report 
the following January. : 
The extent of the cooperation in the survey is indicated by the fact 
that— 
An intensive study of 659 rural village schools in 88 counties and an extensive study 
of 9,000 schoolrooms in 395 school systems [were] participated in by 44 professors in 
professional schools for the training of teachers and 116 students in these institutions, 
most of whom had had experience in rural tchool teaching, 395 superintendents of 
schools, and other school men and women, and 9,000 teachers who supplied information 
to the commission. 
In addition many persons— 
participated in conferences and round-table discussions in which the constructive 
suggestions of the commission were submitted to close criticism. 
The cooperative character of the enterprise is still further indi- 
cated by the 12 forms used in the field survey of schools and a number 
of questionnaires sent to individuals, such as auditors, superintend- 
ents of schools, and teachers at teachers’ institutes. (Appendix B, 
pp. 306-352.) 
The topics included in the survey as presented in the report (352 
pp.) and treated in the 22 chapters, most of which close with ‘con- 
structive suggestions,” were as follows: 
Administration of the office of State superintendent; school supervision; certification 
of teachers; the academic training, experience, and tenure of office of teachers now in 
service; the professional training of teachers; classroom instruction; equipment of 
elementary schools; the physical plant; the care of the health of pupils; records and 
reports; slow progress, over-age, and nonpromotion; township, village, and special 
district high schools; living conditions of teacher; outside cooperation with rural 
schools; general community conditions; local administration of school law; special and 
village districts compared with township districts from which they are cut; rural 
boards of education; consolidation and centralization of schools; State aid to common 
schools; and standardization of schools rather than of pupils and students.
-P-A-G-E-591
        SCHOOL SURVEYS. 555 
The report concludes with the following résumé: 
The work of the office of the State superintendent of public instruction is ham- 
pered by lack of room, necessary equipment, and adequate inspectorial and clerical 
force. The superintendent himself is forced to devote a large part of his time to 
office detail. 
The department should be provided at once with more space (it now has but three 
rooms, two of these very small), more equipment for filing and preserving records, 
and more office force, so that the State superintendent of public instruction can 
devote his time to larger matters of policy. 
Many rural districts and some village districts are inadequately supervised. 
A system of State-wide and as nearly as possible full-time supervision should be 
inaugurated, providing for combined county and district supervision applying to all 
school districts outside the cities. 
The present method of certifying teachers is too cumbersome and puts a premium on 
ability to pass written examinations. 
Many grades of certificates should be abolished and every candidate for teacher’s 
license should be required to pass a classroom test. 
Large numbers of teachers in rural, village, and small city districts have no pro- 
fessional training and even no academic training above the high school. 
A State-aided system of teacher training in connection with first-grade high schools 
in rural and village districts should be established. Summer schools for teachers 
should be standardized and increased in number. Teachers’ institutes, wherever 
retained, should be reorganized and strengthened. 
Much good instruction was observed in all grades of schools, but in many and widely 
separated districts the need of careful supervision was very evident. 
Many schools were deficient in necessary academic and hygienic equipment. This 
was not always due to lack of funds, as neighboring districts of similar financial stand- 
ing often differed widely as to amount and character of equipment. 
Many schools, particularly rural schools, are in insanitary condition. In many 
cases privies, especially in some township districts, are in a disgraceful condition. 
Ideal condition as to cleanliness in one district may exist side by side with exactly 
opposite conditions in a neighboring district. 
All schools should be compelled to come up to a decent standard of cleanliness and 
academic and hygienic equipment. 
Good examples of ventilation, heating, and lighting are found in all grades of schools, 
but undesirable conditions are widspread. 
The salaries of teachers are inadequate in many schools, particularly in rural dis- 
tricts. Other living conditions are often not of a nature to tend toward length of 
service in the profession. 
Outside cooperation with public schools is comparatively rare and except in the 
cities, the social use of buildings is infrequent, although there are some outstanding 
examples of social center work in rural communities. 
A widespread revival of the use of school buildings as community meeting places 
is demanded in the interest of the social life of rural communities. Such a revival 
would go far toward, on the one hand solving the problem of retaining good teachers 
in rural districts, and on the other increasing the interest of patrons of rural schools. 
Many rural boards of education are breaking school laws by non-enforcement of the 
compulsory-atiendance law, by refusing to pay teachers for janitor service and attend- 
ance at institutes, and by maintaining school for less than 32 weeks pér year. 
Boards of education should be compelled to obey all State laws on pain of non- 
participation in State funds. 
Too many exceedingly small schools are maintained in the State. Such schools 
are always expensive and in the main inefficient.
-P-A-G-E-592
  556 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Consolidation and centralization should be encouraged whenever practicable. 
Wherever the one-room school is the most practicable—and this is often the case—it 
should be the best possible one-room school. A good one-room school may be made 
efficient and is always better than a poor or fair graded school. 
No schools, except high schools, are effectively standardized. 
All schools should be standardized, and the graduates of lower schools should be 
eligible for admission to a higher school without State examinations. Institutions 
should be standardized rather than students or pupils. All standardization should 
be concerned with the quality as well as with the quantity of work done, and the 
greatest freedom should be allowed each individual school to develop its individuality 
along the line of service to its community. 
STATE OF VERMONT. 
The report of “the first survey that has ever been made of all of 
the educational facilities in a State’? was published February 15, 
1914, by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 
in “A Study of Education in Vermont” (Bulletin No. 7, Parts I and II, 
214 pp.). This study was made at the request of the educational 
commission which was authorized by a joint resolution of the Legisla- 
ture of Vermont November 19, 1912, as follows: 
That a commission of nine persons, at least two of whom shall be experts in or 
engaged in educational work, shall be appointed by the governor to inquire into the 
entire educational system and condition of this State. This commission shall report 
at the earliest possible date on the several rights, duties, and obligations of the Univer- 
sity of Vermont and State Agricultural College, Middlebury College, and Norwich 
University, with such recommendations as will prevent unnecessary duplication 
and consequent financial waste. 
That as soon as practicable after reporting on the institutions of higher learning 
hereinbefore referred to, the said commission shall recommend, by bill or otherwise, 
such reorganization of our public elementary and secondary schools, in adjustment 
to the entire educational system of the State, as will promote the ends of unity, har- 
mony, economy, and efficiency. 
On February 24, 1913, the commission invited the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for the Advancement of Teaching to conduct the investigations. 
“Six months to a study in the field and an equal time to the examina- 
tion and presentation of the records and suggestions”’ were given under 
the direction of President Henry S. Pritchett, by 12 members of the 
staff of the foundation and the following eee who investigated 
the topics named: 
Edward ©, Elliott, University of Wisconsin—The normal schools and the State 
system of administration and expenditure; Milo B. Hillegas, Teachers’ College, 
Columbia University—Elementary schools; William §. Learned, Harvard Univer- 
sity—Secondary schools (the reports of the last two are signed by each, respectively, 
and these reports form ‘the backbone of the educational inquiry”); Edward H. 
Farrington, University of Wisconsin—The agricultural college; Nathaniel B. Potter, 
Columbia University—Medical school; George R. Olshausen, United States Bureau 
of Standards—The three engineering schools; Miss L. E. Stearnes, Wisconsin Free 
Library—Library facilities in relation to the public schools; and William Leslie, 
public accountant.—The scope of the system of accounts and financial statements.

The features of the study appear in the topical arrangement of the 
report, which is as follows: 
Parr I. Mernops anp Resutrs. 
1. The reason for the inquiry; 2. The method of the inquiry; 3. Conclusions and 
recommendations. 
Part II. Description anp Discussion. 
1. The State of Vermont; 2. The existing educational system; 3. The elementary 
schools; 4. The secondary schools; 5. The training of teachers; 6. Vocational schools; 
7. Records and accounts; 8. The financial support of the public-school system; 9. 
The reorganization of the agencies for administration; 10. The Vermont colleges and 
their relations to the State; 11. The University of Vermont; 12. Middlebury College; 
13. Norwich University; 14. The history of Vermont subsidies to higher education; 
15. The outlook for higher education in Vermont; 16: Program of reorganization. 
It was assumed that all conclusions, recommendations, and pro- 
posals for legislation belonged entirely to the educational commission 
and not to the individuals who were engaged in making the study. 
In the course of the presentation of the essential facts that were 
discovered, the study led to certain conclusions, which were resolved 
in the following recommendations: 
1. The recognition by the State of the reorganization of elementary and secondary 
education, including vocational training, as its immediate and supreme duty. 
2. The organization of the office of a commissioner of education upon a basis com~ 
petent to furnish expert supervision for the public-school system. This involves a 
small lay board serving without salary, and salaries for educational experts of a charac- 
ter to secure the ablest men and women. The details of this organization are given in 
Section IX of Part IT. 
3. The problem of revision of the course of study, the establishment of agencies for 
training teachers, and other administrative details to be worked out by this board 
and its experts. 
4. The State Agricultural College to receive a larger proportion of the generous 
annual appropriation to the State from the Federal Government and to be developed 
along lines calculated to make a fruitful connection between the agricultural college 
and the industries of farming, dairying, gardening, stock and poultry raising, and 
fruit culture. 
5. Subsidies to higher education should cease, the [three] colleges being pes a 
reasonable time in which to rearrange their budgets. 
The report concludes with a suggested program of reorganization 
which defines general policies, measures for legislative enactment, 
the administrative policy of the State board of education as regards 
elementary, secondary, and vocational schools, and supervision, 
training, and certification of teachers. 
PUBLIC SCHOOL i88B, MANHATTAN, NEW YORK CITY. 
On February 21, 1914, the New York Bureau of Municipal Research 
published a 35-page bulletin containing typical extracts from a report 
made at the request of Principal Edward Mandel upon the adminis- 
tration and activities of his school for 2,500 boys, Public School 188B, 
Manhattan.

  558 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The data were secured during a 12-day study of this school by 
Mr. A. N. Farmer, of the training school for public service, aided 
by 12 students. 
Each of the 59 rooms was visited at least twice; 45 hours were spent in actual 
inspection of classroom work, methods of discipline, and inspection; over 40 hours 
were spent in questioning the principal and teachers; 75 homes were visited; 25 
boys were questioned in detail; 773 special language papers written by seventh and 
eighth grades were studied; stenographic reports of 18 recitations on all subjects were 
analyzed; test arithmetic questions were given to 1,480 pupils in grades 5A-8B. A 
two-day field study of the extra-curriculum activities of teachers was based on inter- 
views with eight teachers and the principal. 
Numerous diagrams, sketches, and other devices were used to pre- 
sent the findings, which are arranged under the following headings: 
How the school is governed; flexible grading and grouping; stretch- 
ing an “inelastic” curriculum; testing classroom instruction; notes 
on typical recitations; spelling misfits; peculiar idioms in language 
papers; how reading was taught; how arithmetic was taught; one 
geography lesson; pupils needing attention because of nonpromo 
tion or late entrance; conferences with teachers; parents’ meetings; 
decorations; ungraded classes; extra-curriculum activities; athletics; 
clubs; after-school jobs for boys; what pupils want to be; home study; 
discipline; medical examination and treatment; suggestions for im- 
proving the physical conditions. The bulletin includes a statement 
by Principal Mandel for the General Education Board as to how his 
school used this report. 
BUTTE, MONT. 
That later surveys would benefit by the experiences of the earlier 
inquiries is a matter of normal expectancy. This improvement is 
noticeable in a few of the later studies mentioned above, and espe- 
cially in the report of a survey of the school system of Butte, Mont., 
which was submitted to the board of school trustees June 2, 1914. 
On May 5, 1914, the board adopted the following resolution: 
That a survey be made of the schools of school district No. 1, by Dr. George D. 
Strayer, of Teachers College, Columbia University, New-York City; Dr. Ellwood 
Cubberley, head of the department of education, Leland Stanford University; and 
Dr. Frank P. Bachman, of New York City, and two assistants. Such survey to com- 
mence as soon as practicable, and there is hereby appropriated and set aside from 
the general fund of the said school district the sum of four thousand ($4,000) dollars 
to pay the expense of said survey and for the cost of a report from the said persons 
to the board of education as to the conditions of the said schools. 
The two assistants associated with the commission were William 
T. Bawden, managing editor of Vocational Education,! and F. J. 
Kelly, director of the training school, State Normal College, Em- 
poria, Kans.

SCHOOL SURVEYS. 559 
One of the interesting conditions of the inquiry, the time allowed 
for which was four weeks, was the following recommendation of the 
board’s committee on teachers and school management: 
Tf such a survey is made of the Butte schools, we hereby resolve to publish the 
results in full and to abide by the recommendations of the experts, wherever possible. 
At the beginning of the work of the commission it was also agreed: 
That it was the purpose of the survey to acquaint the board of school trustees and 
the citizens of Butte with the conditions as they exist in the public-school system, 
with respect to the school plant and its equipment, the methods of administration 
and supervision of the schools, the instruction and courses of study, the training, 
tenure, and present efficiency of the teaching corps, and the classification, progress, 
and achievements of children in the school system, together with such recommenda- 
tions as might seem to them to be justified in the light of the facts which they might 
be able to collect or observations which they might make. 
The method of procedure of the commission included conferences 
with the superintendent, the board of school trustees, and all teach- 
ers of the school system. Careful effort was made “not to express 
any opinion concerning any individual teacher or other employee of 
the board of school trustees.” 
Further interest of the public in the course of the survey was 
manifested in the invitation to the commission to attend meetings 
of the local labor council, the teachers’ union, city parents’ associa- 
tion, woman’s club, and chamber of commerce. The main object of 
the survey was to suggest “possibilities for improving the opportu- 
nities of the children in the public schools of Butte.” 
Accordingly, all the schools in the city’s jurisdiction, except in the 
rural section, were visited by one or more of the commission. The 
study is of special interest, because it brings forward an emphasis 
upon the teaching side of the system and makes definite contribu- 
tions toward improvements in administrative details. 
The report (163 pages, including appendix) covers the following 
topics: 
Introduction. 
Part I. The Instructional Problem.—l. The classification and progress of pupils. 
2. The quality of instruction. 3. The courses of study. 4. The achievements of 
pupils. 5. Supervision of instruction. 6. Adaptation of the schools to com- 
munity needs. 
Part II. The Administrative Problem.—7. The administration of the schools. 8. 
Selection, training, tenure, and salaries of teachers. 9. School buildings and 
equipment. 10. Census,-records, and reports. 11. Costs and financial records. 
Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations. 
Tables and figures aid in presenting the data studied. The report 
is characterized by the list of eight record and report forms which are 
recommended for adoption by the system. 
In the absence of adequate records, both financial and statistical, 
the commission found it impossible to state with any degree of accu-
-P-A-G-E-596
  560 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
racy the position the Butte schools occupy in comparison with other 
cities in the United States. Much time was spent in trying to work 
out such comparisons, but the effort was finally abandoned. With a 
population of 39,165 in 1910, it was found that only 28.5 per cent 
were of native parents, while 32.9 per cent were foreign born, and 37.3 
per cent were native born with one or both parents foreign born, 
six-tenths of 1 per cent were negroes. The effects of a large number of 
non-English-speaking children upon the school system were noted by 
the commission. The predominant age in Butte is between 25 and 
44 years; 15.1 per cent of the whole population is between the ages 
5 and 14 years, as compared with 17.4 per cent for the United States. 
This relatively small proportion of children of school age * * * should enable 
Butte to provide much better educational advantages for its children than can be 
provided by the average city. 
Owing to defects in the school census, it was found that only an 
approximation could be made of from 75 to 79 per cent of the chil- 
dren between the ages of 6 and 14 years and a few of other ages who 
were reached by the public schools. 
In studying the quality of instruction (Ch. II), the commission 
fixed the following standards for judging the work of teachers in 
terms of the social efficiency aim of education. These standards 
specify ‘‘The degree to which certain qualities are developed in 
children which enable them to contribute to the common good.” 
These are as follows: 
1. Sympathy or responsiveness to social needs. 2. Intelligence, or ability to think 
straight with respect to those issues which involve all members of the community. 
3. The habit of acting for the common good. 
It was found in the system as a whole that teaching had been over- 
emphasizing drills as a classroom procedure. Instead of developing 
the abilities of children to express themselves and to think, the 
teaching had been altogether too much cramming of facts, further 
evidence of which was found in the nature and importance attached 
to the stated examinations. 
Possibly the greatest need of the school system, from the standpoint 
of instruction, is to be found in a change in the nature of the examina- 
tions and in the work of the teachers which will result in an emphasis 
on thinking, rather than remembering. 
The report is interesting on account of the attempt made to measure 
the achievements of pupils by an application of some of the more 
recent standards and scales in spelling, English composition, hand- 
writing, and the fundamental operations in arithmetic. In spelling, 
the Ayres lists of 10 words each for the second to the eighth grades, 
inclusive, were utilized. The Ayres average for schools in 22 cities is 
70 per cent. The Butte average is 80.3 per cent. These data fur-
-P-A-G-E-597
  
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 561 
nish ‘‘evidence of the efficient drill work done throughout the 
system.” The Hillegas scale was used for the measurement of 
English compositions written by children in the fourth to eighth 
grade, inclusive. The results showed that in composition work the 
Butte children were low in comparison with certain classes in other 
parts of the country. It was found that ‘‘there is relatively little 
growth from one grade to the next, the median score being raised less 
than 2 points from the fourth to eighth grade.” 
The Thorndike scale for the measurement of handwriting was used 
in measuring the achievements of the pupils above the first grade. 
It was found that there is a ‘‘rather singular irregularity in the prog- 
ress made, from grade to grade,” there being a very wide range of 
abilities exhibited. The Courtis tests were used in the four funda- 
mental operations and the Stone problems in reasoning for measuring 
the work in a number of classes selected at random from 5B to 8A 
classes. It was found that in comparison with median scores made 
by children in Detroit, Boston, and a group of smaller cities, the 
results in Butte in the fundamentals are very satisfactory. The 
Butte children are a little low in addition, about equal in subtraction, 
and high in multiplication and division. In the reasoning problems 
the results showed ‘‘a lack of clear thinking.”’ 
The recommendations are appropriately distributed throughout 
the report and among them may be mentioned the following: 
1. To meet the problems of over age special classes and a summer elementary school 
should be established. 
2, A reorganization of the courses of study and a change in the type of examination 
are recommended in order to decrease the number of nonpromotions. 
3. Because of the overemphasis on drill work and the neglect of work involving 
thinking, more careful supervision and more adequate professional training should be 
secured. 
4, There should be established an intermediate school of three years for children 
who have completed the sixth grade. 
5. In order to adapt the schools to the community needs, the commission recom- 
mended that the following should be established: Kindergartens; special classes 
for non-English-speaking children as well as backward children; wider use of the 
school plant; greater opportunity for play and recreation, and more adequate health 
supervision. 
6. To improve the state of inadequate professional training, a summer school should 
be opened in Butte for teachers, all of whom should be required to attend this school 
or some other recognized summer school and be paid a month’s additional salary for 
such attendance; and also the maximum salary increases should be based upon the 
securing of additional professional training. 
7. Various features of the school buildings and equipment are presented for im- 
provement, including reference to the work of the janitors who should be given such 
training as will insure more satisfactory service. 
8. Special forms, including school census book and card census-file report, attend- 
ance and scholarship, reports on attendance, and a standard financial report.

COST OF SURVEYS. 
An educational survey project is at once confronted with the 
question of cost. In the absence of readily available information as 
to the outlays required in the above inquiries, Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, 
of the division of education, Russell Sage Foundation, has kindly 
furnished the following statement regarding the cost of about two- 
fifths of the surveys: 
Montclair, N.J., $500; Baltimore, Md., $2,000; East Orange, N. J., $1,000; Bridge- 
port, Conn., $1,000; Waterbury, Conn., $126.89; New York City, from $95,000 to 
$125,000, depending on the inclusion or omission of different items; Greenwich, Conn., 
survey and exhibit, $2,500; Portland, Oreg., $7,500; State of Ohio, $10,000; State of 
Vermont, $10,000.

CHAPTER XXV. 
AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 
WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO HIGH SCHOOLS. 
By James Manoney, 
Special Collaborator; Master, Head of English Department, South Boston High School, Boston, Mass. 
Contents.—Evaluation of the surveys—The spirit of American citizenship—The viewpoint of the Republic 
as revealed in the surveys—American spirit in high-school administration and program of studies— 
The high-school problems—The balance sheet. 
EVALUATION OF THE SURVEYS.! 
It is more than a coincidence that the scientific evaluation of 
railroads and scientific accountancy, as well as educational surveying, 
should have made extraordinary progress in the last 10 years. They 
all have a common origin. Indifference and the pride of waste 
are giving way to thought for the future and a determination 
to know just how we stand. This surely is a wholesome thing. 
Keen vision and searching analysis are probing every phase of public 
life. The spirit of America is awake. With renewed conviction of 
her mission in the world, she looks for facts, and seeks to square her 
conduct with her conscience. 
Of all the fields of public service, of most concern to her is the state 
and conduct of her schools. In their efficiency lies her destiny. And 
of all the schools, the high schools, for the past five years, have been 
of keenest interest—subject of highest hope and of sharpest censure; 
eldest of all the schools, yet, with new life, growing by leaps and 
bounds, changing their plan and purpose, and seeking greater scope 
for action. What must she think of them? 
The thought has been anticipated; here are scores of surveys 
ready to her hand; for a decade trained investigators have been 
“taking stock,” and casting school accounts. Widely scattered 
towns and rural districts, great cities and entire States, have felt 
  
1 There is some difference of opinion as to what a “survey” is, but for the purposes of this chapter the 
following definition has been adopted: : 
An educational survey is a formal attempt, with a constructive purpose, to ascertain essential facts in regard to a 
school, @ system of schools, or @ series of systems. 
“Strict construction” might reduce the list, but a fair interpretation will admit that even the slighter 
surveys have made some contribution to our knowledge of school conditions, and all have been of distinct 
local service. See bibliography, p. 592. 
563

    564 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the surveyor’s probe. The aggregate should give some adequate 
general notion of the value of the schools. 
The slightest examination will reveal, however, that these surveys 
are not only of very unequal value, but that each was made to solve 
a distinctly local and special problem. How can the Nation find in 
them material for her balance sheet? How appraise their findings? 
How cast equality between the debits and the credits? What test, 
what common standard can be found? 
That standard must be found in the law of growth in organic life: 
whatever brings an increment to the vital principle within is of value, 
and to that degree; all else is waste, and tends to disease and death. 
What, then, is the vital principle of the Republic? Fortunately for 
us, it is clear to all men; it has been dominant in her history; it is 
basic in her Constitution and her law. 
I. She asserts the supreme value of every human personality, 
and therefore guarantees the right of every citizen to ‘‘life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness.” 
II. To secure that right, she grants him a full share in the exercise 
of sovereignty. 
III. In order that each citizen may understand the meaning of 
that imperial right, and its necessary dangers from human selfish- 
ness, passion, and ignorance, and exercise the right with a just 
regard for the equal rights of all, she insists on universal education 
as the condition of her own existence—the first nation to stake her 
existence on a single principle, and that, a spiritual conception of 
humanity, a sovereign standard. 
Hence the primal need of constructive civic education, producing 
in the youth thoughts and habits that will secure— 
A. Individual power of self-support, self-reliance, self-control; 
B. Habitual cooperation for social integrity and common welfare; 
C. Love and the spirit of sacrifice for the Republic, to secure her 
power and honor. 
These qualities concenter in the ideals of home, of country, and 
(Washington and Lincoln said) of God; and fuse into unity in the 
spirit of American citizenship. 
CITIZENSHIP AND THE SURVEYS. 
What say the surveys? 
I. Is this spirit embodied in the general aim of all high-school work ? 
II. Does it inspire all activities of the entire school staff (a) In 
the business administration of the schools? (b) In the teaching and 
supervising of the schools? 
III. Are the studies and courses used as means of its realization ? 
IV. Are adequate civic habits the purpose and result of it all? 
Have the surveyors had this civic point of view, or have their 
eyes been fixed on purely local needs and purposes ?

No graph can with fairness be attempted, because of the varia- 
tion in aim and the wide range in quality exhibited in the various 
surveys; but the citations will in general reveal the common trend; 
and further, the failure of citations will reveal the limitations. Where 
the surveys fail, the special authors and the experience of teachers— 
especially of the National Education Association in its plan for 
reorganization—may serve. 
THE VIEWPOINT OF THE REPUBLIC, AS REVEALED IN THE SURVEYS. 
It (secondary education) should lift the general level of intelligence, character, and 
efficiency—it aims to reach the “‘masses” as well as the ‘‘classes.”,—New York, Vol. 
I, 159.1 
Democracy is the organic expression of high average intelligence and character.— 
Syracuse, 19. 
Should we be astonished at incompetency and corruption, at bossism and machine 
politics in American ‘local government * * * Should there not be * * * 
systematic instruction in the essential principles of democracy?—Ibid., 25. 
A mere intellectual understanding of what good government re- 
quires is of slight concern to a corrupt or wholly selfish man; as is in- 
dicated by the same survey, the need is for correct habits of doing 
duties, in private and in public life——Syracuse, 20. 
A high degree of intelligence, patriotism, integrity, and morality on the part of 
every voter * * * is necessary to insure continuance of that government and the 
prosperity and happiness of the people.—North Dakota, 21. 
Specific education for citizenship is needed.—Chicago (1894), 176. 
AMERICAN SPIRIT IN HIGH-SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AND PROGRAM 
: OF STUDIES. 
The school board.—Does the school board, which directly repre- 
sents the people, exercise its authority so that the spirit of American 
citizenship is fostered in the high schools and the needs of American 
life and American citizenship are subserved; and does it render a full 
account of its work to the people, so that they may be progressively 
informed regarding school questions, and may be the better prepared 
for the maintenance of true school interests? It is surely important 
that the source of authority in the schools should truly represent the 
spirit of American citizenship, in service and responsibility. 
A note of warning is sounded regarding danger from selfish com- 
binations to control the schools.—(Baltimore, 8, 9; Sacramento, 24; 
Portland, 16.) 
How can these dangers be avoided? How can the right kind of 
board be secured? Should the board be appointed or elected? 
Should it be large or small? Education and politics can not be 
mixed; but the responsibility is on the people. Many authorities

-P-A-G-E-602
ee ee ee ee 
566 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
prove that the board should be small, independent, elected at large, 
and should serve without pay.—(Sacramento, 18-24; Chicago, xiii.) 
This inquiry has reemphasized that the public school is a great engine of democracy 
and as such should not be dominated by any one class.—New York, Vol. I, 17. 
The way to get a higher type of school committeemen is to throw all administrative 
duties and detail work upon the superintendent, and thereby make it possible for 
the board to do all its legitimate business at a meeting lasting only an hour and a 
half, once in two weeks.—Portland, 16. 
This leaves the board free alike from the strong personal pulls and influences and 
the petty details of school administration, with time to devote to the larger problems 
of its work.—Ibid, 25. 
The question at once arises: ‘‘Why not abolish the board, and 
leave all the problems to the superintendent?’ If he, as an expert, 
is needed to solve the smaller problems, why should not he, with 
greater reason, be given authority to solve the larger problems? 
But consider this: If the school board members, independent 
citizens of the community, can not escape politics, petty or great, 
how can one man, a subordinate, endowed with authority over the 
fortunes of many thousands of people and vast financial interests, 
escape politics? Is it, in fact, good American doctrine to try to 
escape ‘‘politics” in American life? Should not ‘‘politics” be met 
and conquered in the open? Is not the problem one of putting the 
burden more directly upon the people, and then, by reports and 
discussion of results, leading them to a fuller understanding of the 
facts, and a sense of their duties and responsibilities in the schools? 
It can not be that the surveyors intend that the superintendent 
should build up an independent ‘‘machine,” for Portland adds (21): 
“Whenever the board comes to feel that he (the superintendent) 
does not come up to the position which has been created, they should 
call for his resignation.” 
But how can the members of the board do their duty in behalf of 
the people, and in bebalf of the superintendent, and the schools as 
well, if they simply have a feeling in the matter? Why should they 
not know, and how can they know, in regard to all essential acis of 
the superintendent, unless they possess first-hand information in 
regard to all material facts on which he bases his judgment? And 
how can they obtain such knowledge about a great school system 
unless they spend more than an hour and a half once in two weeks? 
Why should not a man who is worthy of representing the people 
take time to become familiar with the data upon which the superin- 
tendent bases his judgment in all essential matters; spend some time 
in seeing the schools with his own eyes; encourage his fellow-citizens, 
the parents, to do likewise, so that all may have a clearer under- 
standing of how things actually are in the schools? Public knowledge  
-P-A-G-E-603
  
CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS, 567 
and public opinion are wholesome in every phase of American life; 
they are the safeguards of public service. 
Similar views, regarding the need of leaving administrative matters 
to the superintendent, are expressed by Springfield, 13; Upper 
Peninsula, Michigan (1914), 39; Boston Finance Commission 
(1911-1913); Newburgh, 10; Philadelphia, 59; East Orange, 62; San 
Mateo, 23; New York, Vol. III, 195. 
The initiative, in appointments of teachers, should be left with the superintendent; 
but the board has the right to disapprove.—Bridgeport, 11, 12. 
The superintendent should be the thinking and constructive leader of the schools, 
and failure to be that is sufficient ground for his removal.—Butte, 113. 
The chief duty of the board is to appoint a competent staff and then hold it respon- 
sible for technical and executive functions, and it learns about the performance of 
these functions by receiving reports from the staff. It should discuss and criticise 
those reports, and should render a clear and accurate report to the people.—New York, 
Vol. I, 191. 
The New York final report goes further and asserts that the great 
questions of educational policy should not be solely solved by the so- 
called educational expert. These are questions about which tho 
opinions of specialists in other fields and of the laymen are of great 
value. They are, furthermore, questions that should be solved in 
the light of the public opinion, existing among the people of the city, 
which is represented by the board of education. (New York, Vol. 
I, 191; Vol. III, 31.) 
Perhaps it is the belief that the people of municipalities do not take 
pains to consider the qualifications of school-board members to attend 
to such duties that leads Waterbury to suggest the questions which 
should be answered in regard to school-board candidates, as to whether 
they have the requisite interest, intelligence, and ability to attend to 
such important affairs. kak 13.) 
Upper Peninsula, Michigan, adds that they should have children 
attending the schools; that they should be broad-minded and con- 
scientious. These statements show confidence in the people and a 
belief that they can be educated to an appreciation of the needs of the 
schools. 
Lincoln assumed that the people were fundamentally honest and 
capable of intelligent action on all important matters. That the 
people can be so educated and can understand is assumed by Prof. 
Hanus in his article on ‘Significance of school surveys.’ In regard 
to the efficiency of school boards, he asks this general question: 
“Ts there complete accountability of the board of education to the 
people for the work done and the money expended under its direc- 
tion? That is, is there (a) a system of clear, adequate incontestable 
and accessible records of the educational results, Paes   
1 School Review Monographs, No. 5. 
 
-P-A-G-E-604
  568 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
achieved (furnished by the staff to the approval of the board) for the 
information of the staff, the board, and the people; and (6) a similar 
system of records covering the business affairs and financial accounts 
for the same purpose ?”’ 
The people should choose a few high-class men for the board, who will call open 
meetings and help the various elements of the people to express their needs and form- 
ulate their wishes.—South Bend, 208. 
Since superintendents are put in charge of the entire systeim of 
schools in the larger towns and cities of the country, it is essential 
that the school boards should know how they exercise their power, 
and whether it is in accordance with fundamental American principles. 
A. BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, 
School boards, superintendents, business agents, architects, ete.—While 
the purpose of schools is to afford instruction for the children, it is 
obvious that there is a strictly business side to education. Buildings 
have to be constructed, equipped, cared for; grounds have to be 
provided, salaries of teachers and other officials looked out for; but 
here, as in the department of scholastic administration, we must 
strive to ascertain whether all is planned to facilitate training for 
citizenship; whether all the work is done with a spirit of economy and 
efficiency, from the standpoint of society and of city, State, and 
Nation. Many of the surveys were organized especially to ascertain 
the answers to these questions, and nearly all the surveys have given 
some contribution to the business questions of education. They 
have considered: 
Financial management, judged by a double scale: (1) Local, inter- 
departmental comparisons, i. e., in relation to wealth, taxation, 
population, etc.; (2) interurban and inter-State comparisons, all 
interpreted from the standpoint of needs and actual results; the 
elimination of waste; and the fixing of responsibility (Portland, 
57; Vermont, 140 et seq.; 2d Boise, 15; Newton (1912, 1913); Spring- 
field, 92; Sacramento, 25; Grafton, 27; Boston Finance Com., 
100, 129; Comparative Study of Public School Systems in 48 States, 
entire; San Francisco, 8 et seq.; Newburgh, 97; Bridgeport, 12 et 
seq.; Philadelphia, 56.) 
School buildings and equipment.—School buildings—(1) Location; 
(2) cost; (3) construction; (4) interior arrangement; (5) equipment; 
(6) grounds; (7) care; all interpreted from the standpoint of school 
and civic use. 
At the present time our Kansas communities are spending relatively too much 
money on material equipment, and neglecting to secure the type of teachers who will 
render the grade of service needed.—_Survey of Kansas High Schools, 38. 
The site selected for a school building should be a safe distance from noisy factories, 
lumber mills, or any similar disturbances.—Portland, 229.

Nine schools have reported as having no apparatus.—Ohio, 17; 8 Rural School, 
Maryland, 6. 
Schoolroom decoration.—Sufficient attention has not been given 
to this topic in the past. Slight thought is needed to recognize the 
fact that not only may the school buildings be made pleasanter 
places for pupils and teachers by the proper decoration of the rooms, 
but the decorations themselves may be utilized for silent inspiration 
for social and patriotic ideals—(East Orange, 19, 20; Ohio, 161; 
Rural Illinois, 12, 20.) 
One feature of good school decoration, i. e., proper tinting of the 
walls, has, until recently, received scant attention, and even to-day 
many school buildings give proof of lack of knowledge in this regard. 
Tinting of the walls is not only needed for esthetic reasons, but for 
hygienic reasons as well, e. g., bad tinting is an injury to the eye.— 
(Ohio, 162; Pennsylvania State Educational Association, 30; Water- 
bury, 5; San Francisco, 40; Rural Wisconsin, 26; Montgomery

justment.—(New York, Vol. I, 40; Greenwich, 8.) 
Ventilation should be properly attended to.—(Ohio, 299.) 
Thirty cubic feet of fresh air per minute for each pupil should be provided.—(Penn- 
sylvania State Educational Association, 30.) 
Poor ventilation unfits children for learning.—(Ibid, 84.) 
Only two of the teachers showed practical evidence of understanding the im- 
portance of good ventilation (Rural Maryland (Ms.), 2; Rural School Hygiene, 
Pennsylvania, 8, 16; Waterbury, 14; San Francisco, 40.) 
Not taught or attended to properly.—(Rural Wisconsin, 29; New York, Vol. I, 
40, 41.) 
In this connection, it seems an oversight on the part of the surveyors 
that the topics of noise and dust should have received such slight 
attention. Physicians and sociologists have, for many years, realized 
the importance of those two topics. 
The general subject of janitors and care of school buildings has 
received special attention in the following: Portland, 21, 24, 209;

B, SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. 
The superintendent.—That superintendents are not always qualified 
for their positions is asserted by Kansas Survey of High Schools, 37, 
“at the present time our superintendents are less adequately prepared 
for their work than the teachers who are working under them.” 
That the right kind of superintendent is of great value is emphasized 
in the above citation and also in the following: Baltimore, 107; 
Atlanta, 23; Vermont, 70; Louisville (1912-13); Chicago, 37. 
He needs, however, a sufficient staff of assistants to attend to the 
great burden of detail in his work.—(Ohio, 29; New York, Vol. III, 
205.) 
It is an enlightened and progressive policy to give the superintendent complete con- 
trol over nominations, assignments, and promotions of teachers.—(2d Boise, 8.) 
It is the superintendent who gives character and tone to the school system.—(Port- 
land, 21.) 
The Boston Finance Commission (1911), 15, declares that there is 
no danger of autocratic and dictatorial management from the super- 
intendent’s office. That the superintendent may make mistakes in 
his office, Rural Colorado, 57, intimates and says that as the teacher 
is the most important factor in the school, the superintendent’s mis- 
take is fatal if he selects unwisely; and Prof. E. C. Elliott, in New York 
(Vol. IT), 362, says it is possible that the power of superintendents 
may not be used solely for the benefit of the schools: 
The assumption by those in authority of attitudes other than of such encouragement 
and expectation means the maintenance of a system for the sake of system, and not 
as a means to effective education of children. * * * We find that the board of 
superintendents has become beaurocratic and nonprogressive-—(New York, Vol. 1, 
183. 
os the superintendent is in general charge of the system, it is fair to assume that 
he will formulate its aims. ‘The tap root of effective teaching is to know what one 
is after ; the lack of this has been the greatest weakness.’’—(South Bend, 188.) 
One (person) ought never to assume to prescribe the content and character of the 
educational process to be applied to each of 43,000 young people.—(Portland, 137.) 
The supreme motive of superintendents must be to work for the 
school.
-P-A-G-E-607
CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS, 571 
The best superintendents are so busy getting things done that one never hears them 
find fault with directors or teachers, or parents or taxpayers, * * * hence the 
supreme test of the superintendent's efficiency is found in his ability to create genuine 
sentiment in favor of good schools.—(Pennsylvania State Educational Association, 87.) 
Little attention is paid in the surveys to the need of care in the 
selection of superintendents and the need of greatest consideration in 
regard to their qualifications; as to whether their spirit is truly 
American, their nature sympathetic, their insight unusual, their power 
of leadership and their capacity to induce cooperation great, and their 
sense of justice strong and practical. Yet it is clear that, if they fail 
to possess these qualities, the system over which they preside can not 
conspicuously manifest those qualities. As the teacher, so is the 
school; but it may be with equal truth said: As the superintendent, 
so is the school system. 
Principal.—What the superintendent i is to the whole school system, | | 
it is evident that the principal is to a particular school. 
Principals have sometimes been appointed because of improper 
influence, according to Pittsburgh Gist, 267, and New York, Vol. II, 
303. 
An impartial observer is at once struck by a characteristic attitude of mind on the 
part of principals that concentrate their attention on simply “holding the job.”— 
(New York, Vol. II, 303.) * 
Principals should share in the actual teaching of the school.—(Montclair, 9; Com 
mittee of Ten, 54.) 
They should be able to show how to teach.—(Butte, 97.) 
The chief function of a principal issupervision.—(Kansas Survey of High Schools, 25.) | 
It is the duty of the principal, therefore, to surround the teacher with such an atmos- 
phere as will encourage her to think her own thoughts and to express them frankly; 
that is, to be her normal self; also to impress upon her that he is ever watchful of her 
provision for self-expression among her pupils.—(New York, Vol. I, 335.) 
Principals and teachers should be allowed a fair measure of home rule.—(New 
York, Vol. I, 39.) 
Here again, in regard to principals, one is struck by the slight 
attention that is paid in the surveys to the need of care in the selec- 
tion of principals and the need ofa proper system of promotion 
according to merit.' 
The teachers —What sort of teachers are needed to induce social 
and civic habits? 
The teacher must be of high personal character, honest, sincere, 
and clean-minded, and really devoted to the ideal of our nation. Hf 
he is not, how can he induce those qualities in his students? 
Is the danger of having teachers of low minds and unclean habits 
and inferior character associate with adolescent children fully appre-   
1 Po correct the present “manifest defect” in tho appointment of persons to executive or administra- 
tive positions, certain rules are proposed by the “Survey of Chicago Public Schools, 1914,” which has 
just appeared.  
-P-A-G-E-608
    
572 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
hended and safeguards taken? Is there no danger of ‘‘politics” 
within the schools from such types of teachers ? 
Teaching is the work of spiritual radiation.—(East Orange, 11.) 
If the ideals of the teacher are low, the pupils suffer—(Upper Peninsula (Mich.), 
1914, 4, 7.) 
The teaching and the teacher are regarded as the central factors 
in educational efficiency. How the teacher’s personality reacts upon 
the developing personalities of the pupils, calling forth their latent 
powers, and inspiring them to high accomplishments and worthy 
living, has been a matter of careful observation and record, as noted 
in the Ohio survey. 
Not much instruction, either secular or religious, can be given without a well- 
equipped teacher, whose personality, learning, and moral and religious life appeal to 
those under her care.—(Ohio, XXVI.) 
But are those things insisted on in the hiring and in the promotion 
of teachers ? 
Are the teachers expert in the laws of adolescent growth, and are 
they skilled in culture of adolescent talents, through insight, sym- 
pathy, kindness, and affection? Do they visit the homes, that they 
may the better understand their pupils? 
Any system of education, however perfect mechanically, is worthless unless the 
teacher comes in direct personal contact with the pupil * * *, Any system 
which tends to make the work of teaching impersonal * * * must fail in an 
educational way.—(East Orange.) 
Teachers should have good will toward pupils.—(Bridgeport, 55.) 
The qualities of insight, sympathy, kindness, earnestness, tact, 
and patience receive scant attention in the surveys, though they are 
well enumerated in Prof. E. C. Elliott’s standards of efficiency, as 
quoted in Reply of Superintendents, pp. 32-342 
Special training, health, strength, vigor, enthusiasm, and ambition 
are surely needed by the teacher if he is to impress pupils efficiently. 
Other things being equal, the person with the special training is the best teacher.— 
(Pennsylvania State Education Association, 13.) 
College training is especially favored in the same authority. That 
there may be a danger, however, from too much local talent is indi- 
cated in Springfield, 64. 
Everything possible should be done to make them healthy, vigorous, and joyous a3 
becomes those whose work is with children and who as public officials of the State 
must be held responsible as guardians of the public health.—(Pennsylvania Rural 
Hygiene, 9; Cleveland (1906), 61.) 
What executive and social capacity should the teacher possess ? 
The teachers must possess initiative.—(South Bend, 188.) 
They must be capable of cooperation.—(Bridgeport, 5.)

CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. oe 
What should be the civic status of the teachers? Should they be 
regarded as servants, or as citizens with abbreviated rights? Should 
they live in the community in which they teach and seek to become 
leaders in it? 
We believe that a teacher has a right to be a citizen and a patriot; that to be less than 
either or both is to be a ‘‘mere teacher,’’ and that a mere teacher is to be less than a 
full-statured man or woman.—(Georgia Club.) 
Our young American citizenship should be trained by American citizens, and all 
teachers should have the rights and duties of citizens—(President Joseph Swain, 
National Education Association, St. Paul, July, 1914.) 
The teacher whose work counts is he ‘‘who isa leader and who understands commu- 
nity life.”"—(Committee of Fifteen, Wisconsin State, 25.) 
Does it make any difference whether the teacher lives in the community where she 
teaches * * *? Do not these questions have a direct bearing on the possibility of 
the teacher’s being a leader in the community?—(Ohio, XX VI.) 
The Georgia Club holds as an ideal the teacher who reads and thinks, observes and 
serves his community far beyond the walls of his schoolroom; who claims and exer- 
cises part and lot in the life of his community as a citizen, as well as a teacher; who 
owns his own home, drives his teachings down deep, and shares in the task of com- 
munity upkeep and upbuilding.—(Georgia Club, 17.) 
Teachers would have to study children as they have never done before. The envi- 
ronment must be known, too; and that necessitates visits to the homes.—(Minneap- 
olis, 68.) 
East Orange does not care sufficiently for its teachers.—(East Orange, 11.) 
Surely the work which the teachers do is of sufficient importance to the community 
to cause it to be solicitous for their well-being, and to provide every opportunity for 
its teachers to live as full and rich a social life as is open to any class of its people — 
(Ibid., 11.) 
School assignments.—What shall we say of the conservation of the 
teacher’s powers and fairness in the assignments; pupil-hours; 
diversity of subject and class; time and opportunity to study chil- 
dren? Surely there are limits or norms.* 
Large number is no excuse for machine methods.—(Portland, 137.) 
There is no question but that the teachers in the high schools are to-day required to 
teach altogether too many periods per week.—(Portland, 129.) 
High-school principals and teachers are engaged in teaching subjects rather than in 
educating the youth of the city.—(Ibid., 134.) 
A halt should be called on excessive requirements of the teacher.—(Cleveland (1906), 
61.) 
Of 139 reporting, 102 (high-school teachers) were occupied from 30 to 40 periods per 
week.—(Ohio, 18.) 
That teachers may teach youth rather than subjects it is necessary that they be 
allowed time to study sympathetically the youth they are to teach.—(Portland, 129.) 
Small classes recommended.—(Cohasset, 2.) 
What of a teacher’s freedom in her work ? 
Obedience in teachers is a virtue; just as they expect obedience from their pupils, 
so they must obey their principals and other official superiors.—(Reply of the Superin- 
tendents, 53.) 
  
1 Ballou: High School Organization (New York). 
 
-P-A-G-E-610
  574 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Authority must be definitely placed, and must be respected and 
obeyed, yet schools are agencies to assist in organic and civic growth; 
and in that the teacher’s function is the only one that is fundamental, 
and needless interference with that is fatal to the system. 
It is unnecessary to say that the teacher is the most important factor in secondary 
education.—(Kansas Survey of High Schools, 38.) 
This impression was further confirmed by the report of the committee on hearings 
held in April of this year, relating to cases of 17 teachers against whom charges of 
incompetency had been made by principals. Some of these charges seemed almost 
trivial.—(Portland, 35.) 
“Freedom, freedom for personal influence and for the unfolding of 
personal power, is the thing for which we must strive above all else,” 
says Paulsen, the greatest of the historians of education.' 
The general course in New York City is unwisely and unjustly inflexible. There 
is need for much decentralized authority in its administration, and the delegation of 
greater powers to those who are finally to interpret and apply the curriculum.—(New 
York, Vol. II, 278.) 
The teacher must have a sense of freedom in her work; else how can she have 
“‘initiative’’ and inspire her children to plan and think and act for themselves? The 
absence of this spirit in the daily course of work leaves a school, perhaps, uniform, 
but un-American, and worthless in our life.—(New York, Vol. I, 223.) 
Conditions most favorable for good aftertraining are those which force teachers away 
from mere routine and stimulate them to do their own thinking. —(Bridgeport, 6; 
Portland, 129.) ; 
As for the teacher’s tendencies to disobedience: 
As far as I have been able to observe, everybody is conscientiously and willingly 
doing about as good work as he knows how.—(South Bend, 119.) 
The teacher must haye self-activity, otherwise her ‘‘ teaching’ consists simply “of 
assigning pages, hearing lessons, and recording ‘marks.’ ’’—(Vermont, 80, 96; Spring- 
field, 111. 
All the oe appeared to be in the possession of the greatest freedom in the con- 
duct of their work. There was also every evidence of a desire to cooperate in any 
effort calculated to improve their own work. They constantly welcomed any effort 
to assist them.—(2d Boise, 25.) 
How do practices in regard to tenure and promotion affect the 
work of teachers? 
That changing of teachers is bad is indicated in East Orange, 19; 
Rural Pennsylvania, 19; Three Counties in Alabama, 81; Ist Boise, 
2; Annapolis, Md., Bulletin 2, p. 7; Grafton, 123. 
Permanent tenure frees teachers from the ‘‘disturbing uncertain- 
ties of annual election,” according to 2d Boise (8), but an absolutely 
fixed tenure is bad for all concerned (Portland, 46 et seq.); and 
Cleveland, (79), reminds that ‘‘Promotion should be merited; any 
other basis is a dishonest basis.” 
Of course, dishonesty in the management of a system poisons the 
system and the teacher’s mind—the source of efficiency in the schools;   
1 Hdheren Schulen, p. 28.

CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 575 
produces lack of confidence, suspicion, toadyism, cliques, and favorit- 
ism, in the atmosphere of which good work is impossible. A plan of 
merit promotion is outlined in Sacramento, 118, and Cohasset, 3. 
Salaries and “ equal pay.” —Nearly all the surveys insist that the 
teachers’ salaries are too low, and that a fair salary is necessary if the 
teacher is to be in good condition physically and mentally for her 
work; she must be able to command the decencies and some of the 
comforts of life, and have her mind free from worry for her future. 
As for “equal pay,’”’ the New York superintendent’s report (1913), 
page 226, says that it “surely eliminated men from the teaching corps.” 
More men are needed in high schools. (Chicago, 98.) 
Since the official contact of teachers with their superiors may be 
so vital or so injurious, what is to be said of the nature of super- 
vision ? 
Supervision of teachers. 
vision:   
Duties of those charged with super- 
1. Demonstration of methods. 
2. Criticism of instruction given by teachers. 
8. Securing of the participation of teachers in the development of supervisory 
and administrative policies. 
4. The measurement of achievement of pupils.—(Butte, 97.) 
It is a mistake to think that anyone can inspect our naa schools.—( Kansas 
Survey of High Schools, 14.) 
The system seemed to be suffering from too many rules and too little personal 
initiative. * * * The overdirection seemed in a way to be stifling the growth 
of those in it and in part paralyzing their impulses to individual action.—(Port- 
land, 28.) 
A good supervisory organization always places a positive premium on the develop- 
ment of those personal and professional qualities which give tone and character to a 
school. It encourages a judicious use of personal liberty in action and stimulates 
thinking and personal growth by placing responsibility and encouraging initiative. 
Especially in the high school does it place a premium on intelligent departures from 
uniform procedure.—(Ibid, 31.) 
Supervision is a complex task.—(Vermont, 74; 107.) 
It aims to establish and maintain for the individual teacher and the individual 
pupil standards of worth and attainment.—(New York, Vol. II, 320.) 
Cooperation under leadership is the fundamental principle of effective supervision— 
(New York, Vol. I, 182; Prof. Hanus, Preface to Dr. Elliott’s School Supervision 
(N, Y.) Sch. Eff. Series. ) 
oo. is need of constructive supervision. —(Springfield, 66.) 
The majority of the principals seem lacking in the essentials of a good and helpful 
leader. By this we mean the ability to improve and develop teachers as teachers; 
to encourage and aid them in their particular work; to advise them as to better ways 
and methods and to inspire them with confidence and to enthuse them for the work 
of instruction.—(Portland, 35.) 
To be such a leader a principal should know the details of all phases of the school 
work as well or better than do his teachers; he ought to be able to take their classes 
from them and teach them as well or better than they can; and in methods of work 
and reasons for doing things he ought to be distinctly their leader.—(Ibid., 35.) 
The number of supervisors may be insufficient.—(Baltimore County, Md., 59.) 
   
-P-A-G-E-612
576 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Large numbers of children to be educated demand correspondingly large numbers 
of teachers for the task. Only let each teacher bear the responsibility and exercise 
the intelligence worthy of a real teacher and the individuality of the child, who is 
lin asystem of 100,000 pupils, may be as fully respected and as adequately treated as 
though he were 1 in asystem of 100 pupils. The progressive withdrawal from teachers 
and principals, as their numbers increase, of opportunity and responsibility for the 
exercise of worthy educational intelligence, and the corresponding increased assump- 
tion of responsibility by central authority as the knowledge for the exercise of it 
decreases, is indeed a prevalent, but none the less a mistaken practice, without 
justification or merit.—(Portland, 138.) 
It ought to be the superintendent’s chief business to read, study, observe, think, 
plan, advise, and lead.—(Portland, 37.) 
Teachers * * * are constantly gathering practical experience which would be 
valuable to the administrative authorities. Consequently their advice may often be 
advantageously sought.—(Newburgh, 11.) 
THE HIGH-SCHOOL PROBLEMS. 
Let us-strive to ascertain the contour and dimensions of this high- 
school undertaking. 
To care for hundreds of thousands of boys and girls, of every blood, 
nature; and disposition; all different, all alive, all changing, sentient, 
sensitive creatures, growing rapidly with the new-born emotions and 
thoughts of manhood and womanhood in the making, and yet to 
awaken and develop, in each one, common qualities for our civil 
life—that is the creative task of the high school. The public, the 
social, the national needs must be regarded, but the glory of our 
State consists in the fact that the individual’s need and interest are 
also sacred. 
The individual’s need and interest should determine studies and 
methods. 
The policy of treating every boy and girl according to individual needs seems so 
profoundly reasonable that it is hard to believe that any other policy could be obviously 
and deliberately pursued. Yet, it is a most obvious fact that until recently almost 
everywhere, and still prevailingly, the policy is not to find out what children as indi- 
viduals need and then to supply that, but to determine on the things to be done—sub- 
jects to be taught, methods of instruction, plans of organization, and administration— 
and to let children adapt themselves as they can to these predetermined requirements, 
or abandon their education.—(Newton (1913), 15, 16.) 
Perhaps the greatest, educational question of modern times is how may the public- 
school system be organized and the schools conducted so as to aid in the discovery 
of the special talents of the youth of the land, develop these talents in the highest 
degree possible, and turn them to social account.—(Illinois (1907), 4.) 
I know now that he would have been interested in the agricultural school, but I 
was always talking dentist to him then.—(Parent’s statement, quoted in Minneapolis, 
21.) 
In this connection nothing has been said of the most important of all principles in 
successful teaching—individual instruction.—(Ogden (Ms.), 3; 1st Boise, 1.) 
Other nations have the same problem, evidently.
-P-A-G-E-613
  
CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS, 677 
A. Matthias, member of German State ministry of education,! says: 
Ever since 1892 the authorities have declared again and again that they would be 
glad to see the curricula handled in a liberal spirit. Intelligent and enterprising 
directors and keen, self-reliant groups of teachers have done their part to avoid the 
strait-jacket, but in vain. * * * Schools have not seldom taken on the aspect 
of factories, where forever the same threads were spun and all work seemed a burden 
instead of a joy. 
What is the proper application of these facts and considerations ? 
COURSES OF THE HIGH SCHOOL, 
While individual instruction must ever be the ideal in American 
schools, human society, as well as school life itself, imposes certain 
limitations upon ideal individual aims. 
Articulation of high schools makes necessary certain adjustments: 
(a) With the elementary schools in order to bridge the present gap 
between them and the high schools; (6) with colleges and professional 
schools; (c) with the business and industrial world. How can these 
adjustments be made? 
The six-year high school.—Can we discover what it is in the teaching 
or administration of our schools that causes the work to lack indi- 
vidual quality, to be mechanical and unproductive? 
How can we secure individual instruction? Can it be that the 
lack of it is due to ignorance or disregard of the nature of adolescence, 
to disregard of the practical needs of the children, and to too great 
dependence on college entrance requirements ? 
The program of studies takes little account of those who leave school at the early 
age of 14 or who go to work. (Montclair, 20.) 
“On the other hand, much that is attempted in the first year 
of the high school, when students have reached the age of adolescence, 
can be done very much better at ages of 12 and 13,” says East Orange, 
57, 58 (see also 63-64); and adds its testimony in favor of beginning 
high-school studies in the grammar schools. This is the view ex- 
pressed in Newton, 1913, which says that it is the ‘‘pupil’s need,” 
not the “quality or quantity of his work in elementary schools,” that 
should be regarded in admitting him to high school; and again in 
the high school his work should be arranged according to his needs. 
This view is favored by Harrisburg, 13; San Mateo (Ms.), 71; 
Ogden (Ms.); San Francisco, 60; Richmond Synopsis, 23, 26; Connec- 
ticut (1907-1909), 67-68; Baltimore, 49; New York, Vol. I, 148, 
463 et seq.; Minneapolis, 7; 2d Boise, 5; Portland, 196 et seq.; Nutley, 
17; Kansas, 29. 
The six-year plan is advocated also by Springfield, 117-122, as 
being desirable there, and as being successful in Berkeley and Los

Angeles, Cal.; Grafton, S. Dak.; Columbus, Ohio; Cokate, Minn.; 
Chicago, Ill.; Neodesha, Kans.; and Concord, N. H. Another able 
discussion of the plan’ is given in Vermont (Bulletin 7), 96-99. 
Admitting that the junior and senior high schools are still in the 
experimental stage, and that there may still be some question as to 
whether they will afford the greatest help in the production of civic 
talents and habits or not, this much is certain, that it is during the 
years of adolescence that each human being is recreated physically, 
morally, and mentally, that bones grow, social powers and affections 
are developed, that ideals take form and luster, the bent of the will 
is given—in a word, that the foundations of character are laid. This 
is the time in which the true teacher by personal quality, by sym- 
pathy and insight, can do a work of lasting value for the youth and 
for the Republic; and the school administration, by assisting, can 
render splendid public service. 
The chief thing is a desire to work. In Kerschensteiner’s words: 
“Tt is as a rule a matter of indifference what form educative work 
takes. The important thing is honest, earnest work.” 
“Local needs * * * fresh intellectual and spiritual needs” must both be con- 
sidered. (See General Education Board, 95,96.) 
But the child’s interest needs to be aroused for this purpose, and an unyielding 
curriculum may not arouse interest.—(Portland, 129.) 
Tt also prevents development of powers of judgment.—(New York, Vol. II, 278.) 
The teachers then, i. e., with an unyielding curriculum, teach subjects and not 
pupils.—(Leavenworth (Ms.), XI.) 
Elective work.—The best authorities approve a certain amount of 
elective work (Ogden, 7). It is admitted, however, that election 
should be accompanied by advice. (Ibid, 8.) 
When a pupil is not getting benefit from a study he should be allowed to change, 
declares Grafton 9, 10, but certainly not so that he will cultivate 
“whim” power instead of will power. 
The school program must cover: 
(a) The school arts—reading, writing, arithmetic. 
(6) Language and literature (modern and ancient). 
(c) History, government, and economies, 
(d) Art (pictorial and plastic, constructive art and music). 
(ce) Mathematics. i 
(f) Natural science. 
(g) Manual arts and domestic arts. 
(h) Physical education, including physical training and athletics. 
(i) Vocational guidance.—(Prof. Hanus, in New York, Vol. I, 136.) 
Now, which of these studies and courses should a high school 
student select ? 
The first and most important thing for a child in early adolescence is to become in- 
terested in something that will call out his best qualities and powers and develop his 
staying habits.—(Portland, 194.)

CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS, 579 
Where high-school students have once answered the question of their life work, 
then does school life become real, earnest, and studious. Concentration is impossi- 
ble as long as that question remains unanswered. —(Nutley, 17.) 
But in general, it seems an unreasonable thing to expect an imma- 
ture child to know what his life work is to be. His school record, 
the judgment of his teachers, ought to be of importance both for 
him and for his parents.in the selection of his studies. The chief 
advantage of the high school consists in the fact that it gives the 
pupil some chance for greater maturity, wider vision, and better 
self-knowledge before plunging into the occupations, whether ‘‘en- 
ervating’ or ‘‘energizing.” Meantime the student will exhibit 
tastes and interests, and surely these should be regarded in the making 
of his program, and in the continuance of it. 
If the high school would train the boys and girls so that they would be ready to go 
after something with assurance, then they could settle such things as wages when they 
go to work.—(Minneapolis, 11.) 
English, and especially oral English, is essential in ail programs; 
it is most potent in developing interest and personal power, clearness 
of thought, and is especially the means for moral and social training. 
This is emphasized in Bridgeport, 92, 120; East Orange, 55; New 
York, Vol. II, 285, 293; Montclair, 22; Indust. Com., Md., 16; 
Vermont (Bulletin 7), 85, 100, 101. 
But standards in English are needed.—(2d Boise, 26.) 
Dramatization is helpful.—(Leavenworth (Ms.).) 
Debating clubs give interest and power.—(Counties Ala., 136.) 
Teachers ought to be able to use good English.—(City School 
Supervision, 107.) 
Poor quality of instruction in English is noted in the Ohio State 
survey. 
The old Committee of Ten! declared that every teacher of every de- 
partment should feel responsible for the use of good English on the 
part of his pupils.   Teachers of science and shop practice need to teach English.—(Gary, 44.) 
History, civics, and economics.—‘‘ Knowledge of civics is not the 
most pressing need of our schools; the first and most pressing need 
is the exercise of civic virtues,” according to Kerschensteiner, Edu- 
cation for Citizenship, 97. 
But the student should give at least one year’s attention to a study 
of the government of city, State, and Nation, according to the state- 
ment in Portland, 161. 
Citizens who do not understand public questions imperil the welfare of the State 
and Nation.—(Rural School Commission, North Dakota, 13.) 
History and civics should receive adequate time.—(Montclair, 14.) 
  
1P. 21,
-P-A-G-E-616
    580 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Only 3.2 per cent of school time is devoted to civics.—(Ohio, 13.) 
Knowledge of civics and history is necessary for good citizenship,—(Industrial 
Commission, Md., 17; Syracuse, 37.) 
Local history should receive especial attention.—(Baltimore, 84; Bridgeport, 128.) 
Pupils should learn to appreciate and feel the spirit of history.—(Butte, 56.) 
In Modern Educational Theory it has been common to define the aim of education 
in terms of social efficiency. * * * These qualities may be expressed as follows: 
(1) Sympathy, or responsiveness to social needs. 
(2) Intelligence or ability to think straight with respect to those issues which 
involve all members of the community. 
(3) Habit of acting for common good.—(Butte, 37.) 
This is the age when the community ideal is uppermost.—(Nutley, 16.) 
But a spirit of confidence, cooperation, and good will in the atmos- 
phere of the school itself are certainly quite as influential as a knowl- 
edge of community needs. When sympathy and a spirit of coopera- 
tion are once developed in the child, a knowledge of social needs 
will add a social quality to his character.—(South Bend, 119.) 
In short, the schools are developing a social consciousness that leads them to measure 
their efficiency in terms of social service.—(Emporia, 259.) 
It would seem that much of our trouble between labor and capital 
might be avoided by a deeper knowledge of social conditions; and 
if ‘‘social consciousness’’ and especially social good will really enter 
the child’s being, it is not probable that they will fail him in his man- 
hood. 
Latin, Greek, Algebra, and Geometry.—It is an odd fact that while 
the renaissance and revival of learning began with a revived interest 
in Greek and Latin authors, at the present time practically most of the 
ills that education is heir to are ascribed to these so-called dead lan- 
guages. Around their tombs fierce battles have been fought, and the 
contest is not wholly decided yet, but it must be admitted that the 
trend of the surveys is against them. 
To-day Latin, algebra, and higher mathematics can no longer be foisted upon thou- 
sands of unwilling high school and normal school and college students merely in the 
name of an alleged culture.-—(New Orleans (D. 8S. Hill), 56.) 
The result is that many small high schools provide Latin to an extent out of all pro- 
portion to the resources of the school.—Connecticut Board of Education (1907-1909). 
Education in the high schools of New York is declared to be too scholastic; Latin, 
mathematics, etc., being required of all—(New York, Vol. I, 163.) 
The Vermont report describes the injury done by the classical 
college program in the Vermont educational system.! 
Most students not going to college should not be allowed to take Latin.—(East 
Orange, 55.) 
I do not intend to disparage the educational value of the classical course for those 
pupils who obviously profit by it.—(Montclair, 24.) 
The old curriculum of Latin, Greek, and mathematics still has its unique place for a 
few students with interest and time to follow them to fruition (New Orleans 
(Hill), 55.)   
1P, 82, et seq.
-P-A-G-E-617
  
CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 581 
Yet teachers of Latin, if we are to judge by the National Education 
Association plan for reorganization of secondary schools, believe that 
Latin still has a place in the general course for efficiency, and Ver- 
mont, 83, seems to hint that it might produce better effects if the 
teachers of it were better prepared. 
Science has revolutionized modern life and must vitally affect all 
school procedure. 
The modern mind turns persistently to those studies which look toward the con- 
quest of life and of nature; and the place of science in school programs is certain.— 
(Vermont, 102.) 
And especially those phases of it which direct the thoughts toward the needs of the 
home and the farm.—(Portland, 186; Vermont, passim.) 
Vocational education.—The severest criticisms of the high schools 
have been that they do not fit the students for their life work, and, 
during the last five years especially, tremendous stress has been 
placed on the importance of fitting the child to take his place among 
the workers of the world, beginning with the report of the Massa- 
chusetts Commission on Industrial Education in 1907. 
Every girl, in addition also to her general education, should know the various arts 
of practical housekeeping.—(Syracuse, 29.) 
The school should do its part to induct the child into the life about him, instead of 
diverting him from it; * * * the school should induct the child into industrial 
and economic life far enough so that his education will serve as a vocational aid.— 
(New York, Vol. I., 57.) 
Vocational education is a local not a general issue. It must be adapted, in its 
content and method, as well as in its organization and administration, to the social, 
industrial, and educational condition of the community.—(Synopsis, Richmond, 5.) 
That special schools were needed for this purpose was stated in 
1907 by the Massachusetts industrial commission, 32-33, which 
insisted that those schools, in order to protect their aims, would have 
to be established as independent schools. 
The desire for such schools was expressed in Cleveland, 1906 (p. 5). 
As the average boy must earn his living by manual dexterity, such training is a 
necessity.—(Ibid, 41.) 
It was but natural that the storm and stress for technical education 
should lead to some exaggeration in statement and in plan and a 
reaction from this again should lead to a just review, which includes 
a consideration for the youth as a human being as well as an industrial 
agent. 
Have less mechanical work and more work which will develop individuality. — 
(Upper Peninsula, 1914, 5.) 
The fundamental idea in the normal development of children is self-activity — 
(New York, Vol. I., 135.) 
Does the trade or shop call only for quick fingers, keen eyes, and strong backs? 
If so, some new machine will displace these; the industrial education of the American 
citizen must also involve that training of the will and mind together, that character 
is the result.—(Portland, 87, 90, 91.)  
-P-A-G-E-618
582 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The hard fact that many children must begin to earn their living 
as soon as the law will permit, makes necessary special consideration 
for such pupils. Part time instruction and continuation schools are 
designed to prevent them from being submerged in the ranks of the 
unskilled. 
The new interest in industrial education has led to a closer inspec- 
tion of shops and factories to determine their degree of suitability for 
youthful laborers. A classification of industrial occupations into 
“energizing” and ‘‘enervating” has led to the thought of rendering 
especial educational assistance to the unfortunates who have fallen 
into the latter classification. 
We are putting the brains into the machine and into the management office and 
making the workman a purely automatic adjunct.—(New York, Vol. IT., 767.) 
The school appeals strongly to that class of young people who are so industrially and 
commercially inclined that they leave school and accept positions where little skill 
is required at meager salaries.—(Columbus, Ga., 14.) 
Industrial training should have a higher aim than manual dexterity 
or purely special technical skill. 
Integrity, honesty, discipline, sound health, fair dealing, respect for others’ rights— 
these have come from the courageous assumption of one’s burden of work, and the 
opposites of these are the results of the desire to dodge the burden. So we have the 
natural law of work, the substance of which is this: Work, and you will reach a higher 
mental development; cease to work, and you will degenerate.—(New York, Vol. II, 
766. 
iS for this purpose the school and shop can work together.—(New York, Vol. I, 23.) 
There is danger from premature specialization in the case of ado- 
lescent children. 
It is therefore clear that the secondary school should not aim to determine a child’s 
vocation definitely, or fit him for a certain calling.—(New York, Vol. I, 56.) 
Yet when it is practically certain what calling a child is to follow, 
it is the part of common sense to give him definite assistance; and 
even if the child’s permanent interest is not determined, practical 
trade instruction may be the best means of assisting him to know his 
own mind, and in any case he may well be the gainer by the train- 
ing. This is emphasized in 2d Boise, 4; East Orange, 63; Atlanta, 
23; Rochester (1911-1913), 110; Butte, 91; Rural Tennessee, 48; 
South Bend, 138. 
Whether a child isto become a mechanic or a captain of industry, 
he should, in either case, be taught to learn how to work and to 
respect labor.   The dignity of labor is and should always be the big plank in the platform of every 
. child’s education.—(Ogden, 6; 2d Boise, 4.) 
Agriculiural education.—What can the high schools do to help meet 
our agricultural needs?
-P-A-G-E-619
  CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS, 583 
Strong agricultural courses should be established as a part of a State-wide system.— 
(Ohio, 156; 1st Boise, 4.) 
The teaching of agriculture is of such surpassing importance to the welfare of Ver- 
mont that a defense of it is unnecessary.—(Vermont, 89.) 
The school should offer a good course, or two courses, in agriculture, not primarily 
as technical training, but, like the courses in manual arts recommended below, 
primarily to give insight and develop interest in an industry of fundamental im- 
portance—whereby society keeps itself going —(Montclair, 26.) 
Boys leave the farms because they think farming of less interest than trading. 
* * * Except in some parts of Indiana and Ohio, the schools are organized for the 
express purpose of robbing the farm of the best boys and peopling the cities with 
lawyers and ministers and merchants’ clerks.—(Rural Life Survey, 15th Conference 
for Education of the South, 93.) : 
Interest in farm life should be encouraged by all means. 
It is clearly necessary to make farm life more attractive for young people, to give 
them a fair measure of recreation and healthful social life——(Rural Missouri, 41.) 
The corn clubs and the corn-growing contests help to this end.—(Rural Wisconsin, 
11.) 
The most effective form of instruction in vocational subjects is that which is being 
carried on by the United States Department of Agriculture in the work of boys’ and 
girls’ clubs.—(Three Counties, Ala., 125.) 
In the spring, the children should be encouraged to plan home gardens and be given 
credit in some way for the work.—(Ibid, 133.) 
Prizes for home gardens.—(2d Boise, 23.) 
School garden meetings.—(Portland, 17.) 
Not only is home garden work vauable in itself; it gives training in the higher 
mental qualities. ‘‘It requires foresight, since the crop planted in the spring will 
not be harvested until late summer or fall.’’—(South Bend, 153.) 
Value of home garden training recognized.—(San Mateo (Ms.), 37.) 
In this connection the statement may be made that home gardening for food is the 
most practical and necessary form of nature study.—(Porto Rico, 17; Montclair, 7, 8; 
Three Counties, Ala., 107.) 
The high-school courses should differentiate into the cultural high, the commercial 
high, the agricultural and the industrial high school.—(Virginia Education Com., 15.) 
Commercial education as now taught in the high schools is inade- 
quate. 
Our commercial education at present trains only for the “‘enervating” occupations 
of commerce, corresponding in a rough way to the automatic work ofindustry, * * * 
As a consequence, the higher type of individual, the energetic, forceful, and ambi- 
tious boy or girl, does not pursue a commercial education.—(New York, Vol. I, 816; 
New York, Vol. II, 43.) 
Music has social and patriotic values which should be utilized. 
Training in music may have social and patriotic value, as well as esthetic.—(Three 
Counties, Ala., 136-137.) 
Music should receive more attention in the high schools.—(East Orange, 55; Port- 
land, 177; 56th Rochester Rept., 309; Montgomery County, Md., 38.) 
Sex hygiene.—Healthy-minded people realize that adolescents 
should have their minds drawn away from subjects of sex to ideals 
of service; and appropriate motor activities should be cultivated, if
-P-A-G-E-620
  584 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
stunted or perverted children are not to be the product of the high 
schools. 
Question. Do you believe sex hygiene should be taught in the schools? Why? 
Ilow? 
Answers. Yes, 92. No, 175. 
No; parents should teach these truths; teachers are not qualified. Imagination 
and morals might be corrupted. 
Yes; parents dislike to talk on such matters; * * * children get their informa- 
tion on the streets.—(Upper Peninsula, Mich. (1914), 6.) 
The answers to the fifth question indicate that patrons of the school are not ready, 
as yet, to have sex hygiene taught in the public schools.—(Upper Peninsula, Mich. 
1914), 11. 
: a ais of its teaching requires further and deep consideration—(N. Y. 
Supt.’s Rept. (1913), 252.) 
Preparation for college—Whatever the effect of the college en- 
trance requirements may have been upon the high schools, the fact is 
a large number of high-school pupils go to high school to prepare for 
college. It was this fact which led the president of Harvard 
University to modify the entrance requirements at that institution. 
This is a reversal of the old procedure, when the high school based 
its curriculum entirely on college requirements. It seems but rea- 
sonable that those who are fitting students for college should defi- 
nitely strive to adjust their courses to the college needs. This point 
is well made in Montclair (26) and New Orleans (55). 
What college courses are vocational in the broader sense is brought 
out in East Orange, 63. 
Promotion of pupils.—The adjustment of school to scholastic and 
vocational needs makes necessary consideration of the topic of pro- 
motions and records. ‘ 
A complete set of records should be kept for each pupil.—(Minneapolis, 7.) 
For over 10 years Waterbury has had in use an excellent system of continuous 
record cards for pupils in the schools, excellent in that (a) by the use of individual 
cards the complete record can be moved from school to school as easily as the boy; 
(6) the things the superintendent, board members, and taxpayers ought to know 
about the children are there on the card.—(Waterbury, 3.) 
They should offer the school history of each pupil.—(New York, Vol. I, 88.) 
Such cards are needed for promotion of pupils.—(Atlanta, 23, 32.) 
There is danger lest the teacher should promote pupils, whether they deserve pro- 
motion or not.—(Montclair, 9.) 
Yet Portland (165) says that promotion of pupils must be deter- 
mined not by what they have learned, but by what they need to 
learn. But the schools of the United States are hardly prepared to 
discard the estimates that are known as ‘‘marks,” and even if the 
Portland plan should be adopted, it might be as difficult to ascertain 
their ‘‘needs” as to ascertain their “learning.” This brings up the 
topic of— 
 
-P-A-G-E-621
  
CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS, 585 
Standards and tests.—The Hillegas scale for composition, the Ayres 
scale for handwriting, and the Courtis tests in arithmetic have 
received special recognition in the surveys. The Thorndike scale is 
recommended in Leavenworth (Ms.), VII, X, and a bureau of effi- 
ciency is authorized (Rochester, 113); such a bureau is advocated in 
South Bend, 112; Atlanta, 33; Ohio, 30. 
Neither the professional reader nor the lay reader needs to be told that there are 
very few established standards whereby the efficiency of educational activities may 
be measured, and that accepted methods of studying such activities are, for the most 
part, yet to be found. The science of education is as yet in its beginning.—(Prof. 
Hanus, New York, Vol. I, 128.) 
PURPOSES AND RESULTS OF HIGH-SCHOOL ADOLESCENT TRAINING, 
What are the specific, personal, social, and patriotic powers that 
our youth should possess? Do our high schools produce these quali- 
ties? Qualities that make for— 
A. Individual welfare: Health, strength of body, mind, and will; 
self-respect, self-reliance, self-activity, interest, ambition, 
forethought, initiative, industry, thrift, thoroughness, re- 
sourcefulness. 
B. Home and social welfare: Affection, modesty, clean-mindedness, 
good will, confidence, truthfulness, honesty, honor, good man- 
ners, punctuality. 
C. National welfare: Loyalty, self-sacrifice, love of liberty, respect 
for authority, law, and order; sense of justice, ambition, 
leadership. 
What are the means of discipline for violation of the moral code? 
Citizenship and its virtues are very real and definite things; they 
can not be secured without definite aims and appropriate means 
taken, whether those means be direct or indirect, for in this case the 
by-products are the chief products. ‘Nations, like individuals, must 
know their own minds and take appropriate means to attain their 
objects.” + 
These aims are clearly spiritual and can be developed (a) only by 
persons of high character and (6) with clear aims and by definite 
methods; (c) by uniform public-spirited policy on the part of all 
teachers, boards, and administrative officers. It is undoubtedly 
best that the student should not in general know the purpose of the 
methods taken, and in general the aims may not be obvious; but 
none the less, the aims and methods should be very much alive. 
The tap-root of effective teaching is to know in specific terms what one is after.— 
South Bend, 188.)

tion of Secondary Education. Branson: The Georgia Club. Sadler: English Surveys and Moral Educa- 
tion.
-P-A-G-E-622
    586 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The need for moral training is declared in nearly all the surveys 
and with an insistence that leads one to the belief that the practical 
need of it is great. In S. Minnesota (51) it is charged that town high 
schools cause spread of immoral influences. 
It (the high school) must meet the call of organized society for the constant addition 
to its ranks of those who by their training can raise yet higher its social standards in 
moral, ethical, civil, and esthetic affairs.—(56th Rochester Report, 248.) 
Manners and morals must, of course, be taught in every lesson, but they should also 
receive separate attention.—(East Orange, 50.) 
Definite tests are suggested in Atlanta (35), and the general dictum 
that ‘“‘boys and girls must be taught to see the value of correct moral 
conduct and character” is given specific attention in the following: 
Grafton, 11; Minneapolis, 67; Massachusetts Industrial Commission 
(1907), 59; Upper Peninsula (Mich.) (1914), 5; South Bend, 35; 
Vermont, Bulletin No. 7, 96-97; San Francisco, 12; Boston Finance 
Commission (1911), 7; Virginia Educational Commission, 16; Leaven- 
worth (Ms.), 10; New York, Vol. I, 135. 
None of these indicate just how the high schools are to raise the 
moral tone. Certainly it can not be accomplished by requiring 
adolescent youths to sit still for five hours per day. That the moral 
spirit and the moral atmosphere of schools are much more potent 
than talk about morals is emphasized in Ohio, 68; Montclair, 9; 
Grafton, 9; and 2d Boise, 25. 
A. PERSONAL POWERS, 
That there should be definite training to produce health, strength, 
and activity of body and mind is recognized by many surveyors; but 
the statements in regard to training of the will are generally vague 
or missing. Yet character depends on the training of the will, and 
will power is especially susceptible to training during adolescence. 
The following imply that the training of the mind in high schools 
has been mechanical and stupid, e. g., the mere assigning of lessons 
and “‘hearing”’ them, with, very often, the ‘‘suggestive question”’ on 
the teacher’s part: Pennsylvania State Educational Association, 85; 
East Orange, 44; Cleveland, 19; Springfield, 68, 79, 111; Butte, 40, 
42,79, 111; Bridgeport, 6, 7,55; East Orange, 38; Rural Wisconsin, 
53; Leavenworth (Ms.), 8; Ohio, 68. 
Pupils should be trained to reason. They should be required to 
think out problems. 
The progress of our democracy depends in the last analysis upon the power of the 
individual citizen to think for himself.—(Butte, 39.) 
Knowledge or information can never be thought of as anything more than the raw 
material of thinking.—(Ibid, 39.) 
The lack of power to think consecutively is due in large measure to assigning too 
many subjects, hurrying over them and doing nothing well.—(Portland, 192.)
-P-A-G-E-623
  
CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 587 
What attention is paid to the qualities which indicate individual 
power—self-respect, self-activity, self-reliance, self-control ? 
Work which will develop individuality is emphasized in Cleve- 
land (1906), 16; New Orleans (D. S. Hill), 15; Upper Peninsula 
(Mich.) (1914), 5; Emporia, 256; New York, Vol. I, 135. 
Motivation and transforming the play impulse into the work impulse.—(Gary, 35.) 
Real things to be made by the children.—{ Bridgeport, 66.) 
To go after something.—(Portland, 18.) 
The schools in Baltimore or elsewhere are worth all they cost in giving multitudes of 
children those habits of self-control.—( Baltimore, 101.) 
The basis of this method is proper coordination between the child’s mind and body; 
in a word, rational self-control.—(New York, Vol. I, 57, 135.) 
Four standards for determining the efficiency of New York ele- 
mentary schools in regard to these qualities are given: (1) Motives; 
(2) values; (3) reasoning; (4) initiative. (New York, Vol. I, 231.) 
These are, of course, fundamental; and any system that really lacks 
them is fatally deficient. 
Interest, initiative, and ambition. What note is taken of the pupil’s 
capacity for these? 
Teachers should assign problems to discover those traits.—(Butte, 40.) 
Examples of Lincoln and Washington influential—(Bridgeport, 79-80.) 
Pupils helping each other; brass band; English—(Gary, 27, 9.) 
Energizing work.—(New York, Vol. IT, 768.) ‘ 
Oral English.—(East Orange, 55; New York Superintendent’s Report, 1914, 28.) 
Something that will call out his best powers.—(Portland, 191.) 
Supplying motives (e. g., higher careers of employment).—(Grafton, 6; Springfield, 
128.) 
Boys’ and girls’ farm clubs.—(General Education Board, 98.) 
Forethought, industry, thrift, thoroughness, andskill? Arethescholars 
required to be through their work and to be planning ahead? 
Collecting necessary information for solution of their problems.—(Butte, 40.) 
Doing school chores.—(Springfield, 137.) 
Respect for work, needed.—(15th Conference for Education in the South, 93.) 
Keeping schools running all the time, so as to adjust them to needs of pupils.—

Resourcefulness and responsibility are essential in American life. 
An obligation to do something to produce something in the world.—_(Emporia, 
Kansas School Magazine, Sept., 1913, p. 258.) 
Thus while ambition is stressed, the sense of obligation (viz, to self) 
is slighted. There seems thus, in general, an incomplete recognition 
of the possibility and need of training the will power. . 
B, WHAT TRAINING IS GIVEN IN THE SOCIAL VIRTUES? 
Are the aims and methods of securing them definitely set forth? 
Purposes should not be set forth in vague, general terms.—(South Bend, 190.) 
What thought is there of modesty, clean-mindedness, and clean conduct? 
Personal purity and the sanctity and value of the family relations are the source of 
sane community life. —(Pittsburgh ‘‘Gist,’’ 237.) 
Personal hygiene.—(Richmond Synopsis, 27.) 
Are not right conduct, sanity, and purity quite as important to the nation as reading 
and ciphering?—(Syracuse, 36.) 
What of truthfulness, honesty, and honor? Are they absolutely re- 
quired? Or, are falsehood and cheating passed with little comment? 
The boy who learns to do honest work is quite likely to become an honest man; and 
we must teach them to do right by doing right by them, and teach them morality by 
example.—(Syracuse, 15.) 
Truthfulness and honor are, of course, covered under the general 
term ‘‘morality,’”’ but they are distinct qualities in themselves, and 
are therefore distinct ends. The word ‘‘honor’’ does not seem to 
occur in the surveys. 
What of helpfulness (e. g., in chores, work), good manners, and punc- 
tuality? Are the pupils required to work, to have good manners? 
And is it regarded as a serious offense to be late without good cause? 
Effective part in the occupation and life of the community.—(Portland, 95; 2d 
Boise, 26.) 
These virtues are punctuality and regularity, ete-—(Pennsylvania State Educa- 
tional Association, 78.) 
The children are acquiring habits of courtesy and consideration.—(East Orange, 
39. ) C. WHAT TRAINING FOR PATRIOTISM? 
What do the surveys say of love of country, love of law and order, 
obedience, loyalty, and self-sacrifice? Are the students trained in these 
necessary virtues? 
The schools are the people’s schools, and the State’s, established for the perfecting 
of citizenship. Good citizenship must be the chief product of the common schools.— 
(Cleveland (1906), 23.) 
Is this too good to be true?—that is, securing the loyalty and affection of every boy 
and girl, father and mother in the community.—(Ohio, 155.) 
From the ages of 14 to 21 they seem to disregard established institutions and to 
break the bonds of the home, the school, and the church.—(Rural Indiana, 13.) 
To what extent have they developed better citizens? Isn’t it true that the younger 
generation knows less about government affairs than the old timers?—(8. Minne- 
sota, 50.)

CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS, 589 
High schools needed in the South to help in solving political difficulties.—(Gen- 
eral Education Board, 95.) 
The personality of the teacher valuable in securing regard for order.—(Spring- 
field, 71.) 
Forty-seven schools do not have a United States flag. —(Montgomery, Md., 30.) 
Need of definite training to secure virtues of patriotism, and a recognition of the 
fact that it is spiritual work.—(New York, Vol. I, 135.) 
Justice and self sacrifice as definite aims appear lacking in the sur- 
veys, as do also motives for ambition and leadership; but what 
could a nation accomplish if its people quite lacked the spirit of these 
virtues ? 
The treatment of the subject of obedience is slight, and leads us 
to consider the general topic of— 
D, DISCIPLINE FOR SERIOUS MORAL OFFENSES. 
What discipline or procedure is recommended for lying, stealing, 
cheating, disobedience, immorality, truancy? Do the schools rec- 
ognize conscience? Do they train the sense of right and wrong, and 
give appropriate sanctions ? 
Together with the instruction public éducation offers, it should therefore insist 
throughout on discipline that is wise, kindly, and firm, including appropriate pun- 
ishment when it is needed—a discipline that insists on progressive conformity of 
conduct to insight, including habits of steady application and reasonable achieve- 
ment.—(New York, Vol. I, 135.) 
This is a wise and well-balanced statement, but definite procedure 
in regard to ‘‘appropriate punishment’’ for flagrant violations of 
good conduct is certainly of importance to the State, whose duty it 
is to maintain law and order. 
We believe that in the principal should be lodged the power of temporary suspen- 
sion of a pupil.—(Cleveland 1906, 21.) 
Protection of the morals of the school is of consequence, even if 
exclusion of a pupil is necessary. But that is an extreme step; yet 
the tone of the adolescent school and the value of all the instruction 
is determined by the way in which those cases of discipline are han- 
dled. A principal without the capacity for moral judgment and 
decision is a menace to society. 
Consider the moral atmosphere of a school in which the following 
is true: 
Lack of discipline was a matter of grave concern which many teachers felt they 
were unable to cope with under present by-laws and present conditions.—(New 
York, Vol. I, 60.) 
Should it appear that the schools do not foster respect for law and 
order, they would forfeit their right to exist. 
As for truancy, mention is made in New York, Vol. I, 94, of a day 
school for truants; and a suggestion is made that district superin- 
tendents might be empowered to give judicial hearings.— (New York, 
Vol. I, 34.) 
   
-P-A-G-E-626
    590 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
And a recommendation is made that for elementary schools, cor- 
poral punishment for unruly pupils should be inflicted.—(Ibid.) 
In the high schools the problem, when occasion arises, is more 
serious because of the greater maturity of the students; and without 
adequate treatment, anarchy exists. There is but little mention in 
the surveys of these graver offenses and their proper treatment, but 
experienced teachers know that cases of them arise in all high schools, 
and, however few they may be, their importance and their practical 
influence in a school of adolescents is out of all proportion to their 
number. Strikes and riots in schools, which are at times reported 
in the press, are more spectacular, but surely not more serious. 
Juvenile courts.—In certain places there are juvenile courts to deal 
with the more serious cases. 
There is need of such courts.—(Scranton, 29.) 
Discontinued and replaced by action against parents in magistrates’ courts.—(New 
York superintendent’s Report (1913), 270.) 
It would save time if all reports of truancy were telephoned to the superintendent’s 
office.—(Newburgh, 16.) 
Four or five truant schools recommended for Portland, Oreg.—(Portland, 209.) 
It seems a brutal, un-American thing to try an adolescent criminal 
in a criminal court for adults. While the student must obey, and 
as an experienced teacher once said, ‘‘It is the child’s right to be 
compelled to obey,” the American spirit demands that he should 
have deeper hold on the principle of obedience to law. In this con- 
nection there is much interest in plans for— 
Student self-government.—Some form of it now found in all New 
York high schools.—(New York, Vol. I, 86-87. Similar experiments 
in high schools of Washington, D. C., and elsewhere; see also accounts 
of George Junior Republic.) 
Cooperation with the home.—Prevention instead of punishment 
should be the aim. A more intimate acquaintance with the districts 
and the home might forestall many a violation of the rules: 
Paradise Alley, a breeding place for physical and moral disease, that can not be 
counteracted by medical inspection of the schools, or lesson in civics.—(Greenwich, 9.) 
Your committee is informed that some children attend high schools without break- 
fast.—(Cleveland (1906), 63.) 
The home and school should be brought into the closest relation possible-—(Com- 
mittee of Fifteen, Wisconsin State, 28.) 
It is certain that many habits are not formed in the child because the home and 
school do not cooperate to establish them.—(Upper Peninsula (Mich.) (1914), 7; 
“Recreation,’’ Springfield, 23.) 
Lack of home influence is bad.—(San Francisco, 16.) 
Parents’ association and mothers’ club may be of very great help, 
according to Rural Colorado, 82; 2d Boise, 23; Rural Illinois, 12; 
San Francisco, 46; Emporia, 258-259; Baltimore, 106; East Orange, 
62.
-P-A-G-E-627
  CITIZENSHIP IN THE EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 591 
Parents ought to more carefully supervise their children outside of school hours.— 
(Upper Peninsula (Mich.) (1914), 5.) 
Home and school should cooperate to stop or supervise ‘‘social” affairs —(Spring- 
field, p. 42.) 
Secret societies.—These should be prohibited, according to Roches- 
ter report (1913), 117; Upper Peninsula (Mich.) (1914), 37; East 
Orange, 64. 5 
Principals and teachers to be discharged for failure to report existence of secret 
societies—(New York School Report (1913), 217.) 
We also beg leave to intimate to parents that social festivities not infrequently prove 
to be disintegrating to scholastic purposes and methods.—(Cleveland, 22.) 
Superintend all societies. Students should be required to give up membership 
in secret societies.—(East Orange, 64.) 
Religious training —Through organizations of parents it may be 
possible to secure greater stimulus for the religious training of 
adolescent children, especially in the danger period. The need of 
such training has received scant attention, save in the rural sur- 
veys.—(Rural Illinois, 15; Upper Peninsula (Mich.) (1914), 4; 
Syracuse, 36.) 
Segregation of the sexes. —What are its advantages? What its 
disadvantages ? 
Segregation may at times be needed.—(Baltimore, 90.) 
In high schools of commerce, segregation raises attendance of boys.—(New York, 
Vol. II, 35.) 
Segregation not due to prejudice against coeducation, but to give each pupil that 
which he needs most.—(Gary, 14.) 
Play and recreation.—A right use of the instinct for play, generally 
strong in adolescence, may prove a most powerful means of whole- 
some education and a method for prevention of vicious tendencies. 
The surveys have given ample attention to this topic.—(See Green- 
wich, 9; Portland, 271, 221; 2d Boise, 12; Cleveland, 55; Atlanta, 
25, 34, 64; Upper Peninsula (Mich.) (1914), 5; ‘‘Recreation,’’ Spring- 
field, entire; Maryland Industrial Commission, 15; Pittsburgh, Gist 
306; Ohio, 16; Rural Illinois, 8-9-10; Rural Pennsylvania, 15 and 
19.) 
Systematic attention to way that pupils spend evenings and vaca- 
tions is necessary for good products in character.—(Rural Illinois, 
9; Gary, 16, 17; Cleveland, 53.) 
Knowledge of child’s life work also a strong means of prevention.— 
(Nutley, 17.) 
THE BALANCE SHEET. 
Among the chief items (estimated for 1914) in the public ledger 
under the caption “‘High-School Education,” is this: ‘‘Debit—For 
the training of 1,250,000 children in 12,000 buildings by 60,000 
teachers, $60,000,000.”
-P-A-G-E-628
  592 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
The items of the credit column are incomplete and ‘‘ Expectations” 
are entered as security. 
But it must be noted that, at the present rate of increase, in six or 
seven years the above figures will be doubled. That fact indicates 
that the American people are giving their confidence, as well as their 
money and their children, to those schools, and if the spirit and 
ability of the teachers, superintendents, and school boards will rise 
to the opportunity, a splendid era of progress for our public high 
schools is at hand.

CHAPTER XXVI. 
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Compiled by J. O. Knott, Editorial Division, Bureau of Education. 
ContENTs.—General survey—Roman Catholic parish schools—The Lutheran parochial schools—Presby- 
terian Church schools—The schools of the Mormon Church—Denominational schools for Indians— 
‘The church and negro education. 
Of the approximately 100,000,000 people in the United States—ex- 
clusive of Alaska and the insular possessions—about 40 per cent are 
reported as church communicants. This estimate of communicants 
does not include the nearly 2,500,000 Jews in the country, prac- 
tically all of whom are affiliated with some synagogue. 
The Jews in this country conduct only five parochial schools, with 
an enrollment of less than 1,000 pupils, these out of a total population 
of school age amounting to about 500,000. AI of these five schools 
are located in New York City, in some of the most congested districts 
inhabited by immigrants who have arrived in this country only re- 
cently. The Jews, however, have an extensive equipment for religious 
instruction which is given to children attending the public schools 
of the country after public school hours. Their distinctive religious 
schools are fully described in the Report of the Commissioner of 
Education, 1913.4 
The total Roman Catholic membership in the United States is 
about 16,000,000.2_ An extended notice of the parochial or parish 
schools of this church first appeared in the commissioner’s report for 
1888-89. Since then, from time to time, reports from these schools 
similar to the one given in this issue have appeared. 
The total Lutheran communion in our country is reckoned at about 
2,400,000. The parochial schools of this denomination were first 
noted briefly in the commissioner’s report for 1904.4. The schools 
were given a special chapter in the report of 1913,° and a brief state- 
ment also appears this year. 
The total Mormon Church membership is given as 356,000. An 
extended description of these schools appeared in the report of 1913,° 
and a brief report appears again this year.

  598 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. © 
The 22,000,000 church communicants remaining, representing the 
bulk of the numerous Protestant denominations in the United States, 
are doing considerable educational work—much of it of nonsectarian 
sort—that does not find a place in any of the bureau’s publications. 
For example, the annual sum expended in 1912-13 for current ex- 
penses on private and higher education for negroes in the United 
States amounted to about $4,000,000. Of this sum, the church 
boards gave approximately one-half. The bulk of this $2,000,000 
was given by churches whose work is not reported except in the rec- 
ords of the several denominations. 
An attempt, therefore, is made in this chapter to embody the edu- 
cational efforts of the church as a whole by including not only what 
the distinctive parochial schools are doing, but also any other specific 
work not elsewhere reported by this bureau that adds to the sum of 
attempts to educate the people. 
As there are about 186 different religious denominations in the 
United States, ranging in numbers from a few hundred to over 
16,000,000, the reports given in this chapter are necessarily inéom- 
plete and cover work done mainly by the larger church boards. 
The work of the Young Men’s Christian Association was fully set 
forth in last year’s report.! The work of the association, with special 
reference to immigrant education, is given in some detail this year in 
chapter 20, p. 444. 
The work of the churches in behalf of immigrants is given also in 
chapter 20, p. 446, and will not this year receive further notice. 
  
ROMAN CATHOLIC PARISH SCHOOLS. 
By Rev, Patrick J. McCormick, Instructor in Education, Catholic University, Washington, D. C. 
In the school year 1913-14 the Catholic parish school system in 
the United States maintained about the same ratio of growth as in 
the previous year. With the unusual increase of 913,827 in the 
Catholic population figures, due to the complete statistics of the 
Ruthenian Greek Catholics, which were gathered that year for the 
first time, the schools increased 147 and the pupils 69,098 over the 
numbers reported for the previous year. The total of schools in all 
the dioceses of the country was 5,403 and the total of pupils 1,429,859, 
as compared with 5,256 schools and 1,360,761 pupils in 1912-13. 
(See Table 2.) 
No material changes in administration are to be noted. The per- 
sonnel of the supervisory officers has been affected by the appoint- 
ment of the Rev. Augustine F. Hickey, S. T. L., as supervisor of 
schools in the archdiocese of Boston, in place of the Rev. George A.   
1 Rep. Commis. Ed., 1913, ch. 26, p. 573.

Lyons; and by the appointment of the Rev. Hugo Tell, O. S. B., as 
superintendent of schools in the diocese of Crookston, in place of the 
Rev. Gerald Speilman, O. S. B. In the diocese of Columbus the 
Rev. John P. Curran has become an associate superintendent, with 
the Rev. John J. Murphy. No assistant superintendent was that 
year recorded for the diocese of Buffalo. In some dioceses, e. g., 
Trenton, N. J., the school boards were reorganized, and in some 
others slight numerical changes were reported in the membership of 
the boards. (See Table 1.) 
The high-school movement continues to spread. Each year brings 
new evidence of the value of parish high schools in completing the 
Catholic system, and an indication of the general satisfaction over 
this growth may be had in the resolution adopted at the Baltimore 
convention of the American Federation of Catholic Societies, held 
September 28-October 1: 
We note with satisfaction the multiplication of Catholic high schools, academies, 
and colleges, the ever-increasing attendance of these institutions, and give our 
heartiest encouragement to the whole Catholic educational movement. 
The opening of the St. Regis High School, New York, in connection 
with St. Ignatius Church, and under the care of the Jesuit fathers, 
may be cited as a notable example for the year. 
The process of standardization of high schools through affiliation 
with the Catholic University of America resulted in the addition of 
23 institutions to the accredited list during 1913-14. The affiliated 
high schools reached the number 70. They are distributed over 21 
States as follows: Alabama, 1; California, 3; Colorado, 2; Connecti- 
cut, 1; Georgia, 2; Illinois, 3; Indiana, 1; Iowa, 1; Kentucky, 3; 
Massachusetts, 4; Michigan, 2; Minnesota, 1; Missouri, 2; New 
York, 3; Ohio, 17; Oregon, 1; Pennsylvania, 6; Tennessee, 1; Texas, 
10; Washington, 1; Wisconsin, 4. 
There should also be noted an increase in the facilities for the im- 
provement of teachers in service by the extension of the summer 
school movement under university auspices. As in the previous 
year, summer sessions for teachers were held at Marquette University, 
Milwaukee, Wis.; De Paul University, Chicago, Ill.; Creighton Uni- 
versity, Omaha, Nebr.; and the Catholic University of America, 
Washington, D. C. The last named, being the summer session of 
Sisters College, opened at the close of the school year an extension 
in Dubuque, Iowa, which enrolled 236 students, of whom 221 were 
teaching sisters. 
Tables 1 and 2 are based on data supplied by the Official Catholic 
Directory, published annually by P. J. Kenedy & Sons, N. Y.

THE LUTHERAN PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 
By W. H. T, Dau, Professor, Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Mo. 
Since the last report the Lutheran parochial school of the country 
has made some gains, but has also suffered losses. The work of 
training teachers at the various seminaries, indeed, goes on with 
unabated zeal. The beautiful seminary of the Missouri Synod, 
which was reported in a previous account, suffered the loss by fire 
of its administration building three months after its dedication. 
This building has now been replaced. To the large school of St. 
Paul’s congregation at Fort Wayne a high-school grade has been 
added, and a school of about the same dimensions has been erected 
by Holy Cross congregation at St. Louis. 
The latest published statistics available on the status of Lutheran 
parochial schools (January, 1914) credit the Mississippi Synod, one 
of the synods which have become federated in the United Synod in 
the South, with 1 school, 2 teachers, and 119 pupils. The United 
Synod in the South had not reported any schools heretofore. This 
synod now numbers 69,603 baptized and 50,819 communicant 
members. 
However, from the oldest of the general bodies of the American 
Lutheran Church, the General Synod, the parochial school has now   
 
-P-A-G-E-640
    604 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
entirely disappeared. The only one of the component parts of this 
synod, the Wartburg Synod (German), which was credited with 30 
parochial schools, 2 teachers, and 500 pupils, does not now report 
any teachers, schools, or pupils.t 
The present membership of the General Council is 766,623 bap- 
tized and 493,279 communicant members. In this body there has 
been an increase of schools and pupils, but a decrease of teachers. 
The present figures are 593 schools, 690 teachers, and 26,067 pupils. | 
Distributed among the various synods composing this general 
body, these totals divide, as follows: Ministerium of Pennsylvania, 13 
schools, 22 teachers, 2,120 pupils; Ministerium of New York, 77 
schools, 41 teachers, 3,295 pupils; Swedish Augustana Synod, 446 
schools, 598 teachers, 18,927 pupils; Synod of Canada, 37> schools, | 
22 teachers, 810 pupils; Manitoba Synod, 16 schools and 728 pupils; 
Pacific Synod, 3 schools and 118 pupils; Synod of New York and 
New England, 1 school, 7 teachers, 69 pupils. Two synods in this 
body, the Synod of Canada and the Manitoba Synod, operate out- 
side of the United States. Deducting the figures with which these 
bodies have been credited, we obtain the following totals for the 
General Council: 540 schools, 668 teachers, 24,529 pupils. In other 
words, the parochial school as regards schools and teachers has lost 
ground in the United States territory of the General Council, but has 
gained slightly in pupils. 
The most significant changes in the synods belonging to the Gen- 
eral Council and operating in the United States are in the oldest 
Lutheran Synod in America, the Ministerium of Pennsylvania, which 
has lost 23 schools, 53 teachers, and 50 pupils. The probable ex- 
planation is that schools which were taught by pastors in this body 
have been abandoned or have not been counted. The Ministerium 
of New York, since the last report, lost 7 schools, 4 teachers, 176 
pupils. However, there was a gain of 2 schools, 4 teachers, 325 
pupils in the Swedish Augustana Synod. The Pacific Synod gained 
1 school and 83 pupils, but lost its 2 teachers. The Synod of New 
York and New England lost 2 schools, 12 teachers, 74 pupils. 
Of the 14 independent Lutheran bodies, now numbering 1,083,141 
baptized and 672,150 communicant members, only the Icelandic 
Synod makes no report on parochial schools. The totals for the re- 
maining 13 bodies have changed since the last report from 2,644 to 
1,426 schools, from 1,524 to 1,986 teachers, and from 97,868 to 
78,981 pupils. As in the last report, these figures include schools 
which some of the bodies operate in Canada, together with pastors 
who serve as teachers. It has been impossible to eliminate these 
features from the totals. There is a loss, then, in the independent   
1 This might be due to an oversight on the part of the reporting officer, but the report from this body 
is compleie on all other points,
-P-A-G-E-641
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 605 
Lutheran synods of 1,218 schools and of 18,887 pupils, while there 
is a gain of 462 teachers. This gain is explained chiefly by the fact 
that the Norwegian Synod, from which there were only estimated 
figures (200 teachers) available at the time of the last report, now 
reports 527 teachers. The other changes, except in the number of 
schools, are probably due to more accurate counting. 
The gains and losses just noted are distributed among the various 
independent synods, as follows: 
The Ohio Synod has increased from 265 to 285 schools, from 116 
to 122 teachers, and from 9,354 to 9,708 pupils. In this synod there 
is still a strong German element; in fact, the synod is German. 
Conditions in the German Buffalo, the Norwegian Hielson, and 
the German Texas Synod remain unchanged. 
Hauge’s Norwegian Synod has increased from 181 to 185 schools, 
but remained stationary in the number of pupils. 
The German Iowa Synod has decreased from 731 to 500 schools 
and from 11,910 to 11,448 pupils, but has increased its 34 teachers 
by one. 
In the Danish Lutheran Church the number of schools and pupils 
remains the same, but the number of teachers has dropped from 96 
to 52. 
The German Immanuel Synod has increased from 7 to 11 schools, 
from 7 to 11 teachers, and from 160 to 702 pupils. 
The Finnish Suomi Synod has increased from 47 to 49 schools, 
from 52 to 53 teachers, but decreased from 2,537 to 2,175 pupils. 
The United Norwegian Synod fails to report the number of its 
schools. In the last report it was credited with 1,000 schools. Its 
number of teachers has decreased from 987 to 941 and its number 
of pupils from 50,584 to 36,500. 
The United Danish Church has had its 111 schools reduced to 89. 
The number of its teachers and pupils is not given in the new report. 
The Norwegian Lutheran Free Church has had an increase all 
along the line from 118 to 185 schools, from 210 to 220 teachers, and 
from 9,575 to 9,700 pupils. 
The insufficient and incomplete statistics available from the inde- 
pendent synods prove very disturbing in any effort to arrive at an 
adequate estimate of the present strength of the Lutheran parochial 
schools of the country. The omission of the number of schools from 
the report of the United Norwegian Church is especially annoying. 
Plainly the 941 teachers in this body must have schools that they 
teach, and the 36,500 pupils in this body must have schools that 
they attend. This omission has cut down the number of schools 
1,000. It is necessary to bear this in mind when the new averages. 
are given and, in general, when one tries to form an opinion of what

  606 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the Lutherans are actually achieving at the present time in their 
parochial school work. 
In the synods composing the Synodical Conference there has been 
an increase in schools, teachers, and pupils. 
In the Missouri Synod, which now numbers 949,771 baptized or 
575,299 communicant members, the number of schools has increased 
from 2,216 to 2,259, of male teachers from 1,069 to 1,097, of female 
teachers from 252 to 274, and of pastors serving as teachers from 
1,166 to 1,192. Hence the teaching force in this body has risen from 
2,487 to 2,563. The number of pupils has increased from 94,167 to 
96,287. 
The 290 schools and 32,825 pupils of the Wisconsin Synod have 
increased to 318 schools and 35,875 pupils. The number of teachers 
(118) has remained the same. This body now numbers 190,217 bap- 
tized or 175,624 communicant members. 
The Minnesota Synod, which now numbers 97,271 baptized and 
48,114 communicant members, has reduced its 155 schools by 1. 
The number of its teachers (26) has remained the same, while the 
number of its pupils has increased from 15,940 to 16,121. 
The District Synod of Michigan, now numbering 21,673 baptized 
and 15,514 communicant members, reports the old number of schools, 
75, but has increased its teachers from 7 to 9 and its pupils from 2,933 
to 3,021. 
In the District Synod of Nebraska, with a baptized membership of 
20,105 and a communicant membership of 11,108, the increases are 
as follows: Schools, from 25 to 30; teachers, from 4 to 5; pupils, from 
995 to 1,085. 
The baptized membership of the Slovak Synod at present is 20,285 
and its communicant membership 15,631. This synod reports the 
same number of schools (25) as in the last report, but has added 2 
teachers (in the last report there were none), and its 1,530 pupils 
have increased to 8,821. 
For the entire Synodical Conference the present totals are 2,861 
schools, 2,723 teachers, including pastors who teach school, and 
154,210 pupils. The increases are 75 schools, 55 teachers (not count- 
ing pastors teaching school), and 5,820 pupils. 
The grand total for the Lutheran Church in the United States is 
4,881 schools, a decrease of 1,002 schools, including the omission in 
the report from the United Norwegian Church, 3,825 teachers, an 
increase of 67, and 259,467 pupils, a decrease of 13,447. 
The baptized membership of the Lutheran Church in the United 
States is now given at 3,638,951 (increase of 105,541), and the com- 
municant membership at 2,376,769 (increase of 59,592). The differ- 
ence between these two figures, 1,262,182 (increase of 46,159), shows 
approximately the number of Lutheran children from infancy to the
-P-A-G-E-643
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 607 
age of their admission to communion, about the age of 14 or 15. 
Accordingly the 259,467 pupils of the Lutheran parochial schools 
represent 20.55 per cent of the child population of the Lutheran 
Church, a loss of 1.89 per cent. In other words, out of 100 Lutheran 
children 20 aitend a parochial school, while 80, including infants and 
children up to the age of 6, do not. 
For the various general bodies these averages are: United Synod 
in the South, 0.63 per cent; General Council, 9.53 per cent; inde- 
pendent synods, 19.21 per cent; Synodical Conference, 33.66 per cent. 
  
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH SCHOOLS. 
By Marshall ©. Allaben, Superintendent, School Department, Board of Home Missions of the Presbyte- 
rian Church, 
A complete account of the educational work of the Presbyterian _ 
Church would include the tasks committed to its board of educa- 
tion (for ministerial students) and to its college board. The present 
report has to do with the church’s schools for children in the primary 
and secondary schools maintained and administered, save in rare 
instances, by the woman’s board of home missions, and established 
only among exceptional populations shut out by some barrier of race, 
language, or environment from ordinary means of education. 
The school curriculum keeps in view the development of commu- 
nity leadership, with the belief that the spiritual, industrial, and 
cultural phases of education are all essential to this end. The general 
program emphasizes vocational training, although from lack of 
facilities this part of the work has not yet reached the high standard 
set for it. 
Mission day-school work began in 1877, soon to be supplemented 
by boarding schools in which the pupils could be continuously under 
Christian influence and training. 
A frequent result of mission school work is a general awakening of 
intelligence that raises the standards of the community, thus leading 
to the development of the public school and the consequent discon- 
tinuance of the mission day school. Efforts are then concentrated 
upon boarding school or community work. The desire is to cooperate 
with the public-school authorities, and when for reasons given above 
the mission school is withdrawn the community service continued by 
the board is planned to supplement the regular work of the public 
school. 
Alaska.—Presbyterian work in Alaska is represented by the Shel- 
don Jackson School at Sitka, with its six well-equipped buildings, 
providing an all-round Christian education for Alaskan youth of all 
tribes. The course of study covers eight grades, including systematic 
Bible instruction. There are departments of domestic science, do- 
mestic art, carpentry and boat building, electric and machine work.
-P-A-G-E-644
  608 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Indians.—Instruction for Indians now centers in the boarding 
schools. These are at Tucson, Ariz., for Pimas and Papagos; at 
Wolf Point, Mont., for Assinoboines-Sioux; at Dwight and Elm 
Spring, Okla., for Cherokees; at Ganado, Ariz., for Navajos; and at 
North Fork, Cal., for Mono girls. Excepting the one last named, 
these schools are coeducational. The training school at Dwight is 
the only one with high-school work. 
Mexican-Americans.—Day schools in the isolated New Mexico 
plazas supply a crying need, and from them the more ambitious pupils 
enter the Menaul boarding school, for boys, at Albuquerque, or the 
Allison-James, for girls, at Santa Fe. Graduates from these schools 
become leaders among their own people as citizens or home makers. 
In Colorado there are two other plaza schools, and at Los Angeles, 
Cal., a boarding school for Spanish-American girls. 
Utah.—Some day schools of former days in Utah have been with- 
drawn. Of the four now maintained, the academy at Ferron is 
the most promising. Many day pupils are enrolled in the two 
boarding academies erected at strategic points. New Jersey Acad- 
emy, for girls, is far north in the Cache Valley; Wasatch Academy 
(coeducational), at Mount Pleasant, near the center of the State, 
has been recently enlarged and developed, providing for about 100 
boarders. 
Mountain field—We have 2 boarding schools in Kentucky, 5 day 
schools and 1 boarding school in Tennessee, and 1 boarding school 
(for girls only) in the Coal River Valley, W. Va. In North Carolina 
our school work has extended over 35 years, reaching farther back 
each year into the mountain coves and isolated places. It is repre- 
sented now by 7 boarding schools, several rural day schools having 
been recently discontinued or transferred to another department of 
home mission work. One of these boarding schools, the Normal and 
Collegiate Institute, Asheville, N. C., as the school of the highest 
grade in the system, had students during the past year from all but 
one of the other boarding schools for girls, and at least 70 pupils 
connected with other mountain boarding or day schools. Of 346 
normal and collegiate graduates within 21 years, 240 have become 
teachers. 
Porto Rico and Cuba.—Nine day schools in Porto Rico and Cuba, 
enrolling about 900 pupils, are the outcome of work begun at the 
close of the Spanish-American War. In several places there is a 
gradual transference of emphasis from the day school to industrial 
and community work. 
Immigrant communities—The Presbyterian schools in immigrant 
communities are on a different basis from others, the work being 
administered locally, although the funds pass through the hands of

the board. Organized effort for Slavs, Bohemians, Hungarians, and 
other foreigners has been recorded, but the day school and com- 
munity work are so blended that they can not well be differentiated 
in a brief report.

THE SCHOOLS OF THE MORMON CHURCH. 
By Horace H. Cummings, General Superintendent, Latter-day Saints Schools, 
The academies of the Latter-day Saints are all high schools, and 
nearly all of them give a four years’ course parallel with that pro- 
vided for the State high schools. The teachers must have a college 
degree or equivalent education, and the textbooks used are in most 
cases the same as those of the respective States in which the schools 
are located. To be graduated, a student must have at least 15 units 
of credit, each one representing at least 7,200 minutes of class reci- 
tation with appropriate preparation, but in most cases 8,200 minutes 
of class work are required. Two hours of laboratory work equal one 
hour of recitation. Most of the schools offer courses in manual train- 
ing, agriculture, domestic science, domestic art, and commercial 
work, besides the regular high-school subjects usually given. Three 
of the schools are doing college work. 
To meet the needs of the church of the Latter-day Saints, all the 
schools giving a full four years’ high-school course include work in 
education, and all of the college work is similarly directed. The 
church has so many educational organizations, whose teachers are 
volunteers, that a vast number of teachers are required. 
The Latter-day Saints’ schools were never in better condition than 
during the year 1913-14. The following table of statistics will give 
an idea of the nature and extent of the work:

DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS FOR INDIANS. 
By C. F. Hauke, Second Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs. 
The attached statement gives the mission schools on Indian reser- 
vations under the control of the various denominations, and the total 
enrollment of each denomination, as shown by the records of the 
Indian Office. This list does not represent all the work done by the 
different denominations and societies interested in Indians, however; 
it is estimated that there are probably as many more schools not 
shown in the records of the office. The Indian Office is glad to receive 
the assistance of any religious denomination in the education of Indian 
children, and wherever Indians are receiving all necessary attention 
from such sources the office does not request reports from them.

  THE CHURCH AND NEGRO EDUCATION. 
There are four general agencies that are sustaining, and to more 
or less extent supervising, negro higher education and secondary 
schools, viz, the Federal Government, the State governments, the 
several educational funds which are giving financial assistance, and 
the boards and societies of religious denominations. 
According to the Negro Year Book ! for 1914-15, there are in the 
United States about 427 negro schools other than elementary public 
schools and public high schools, or those in any sense under Govern- 
ment and State control. Of these, 57 are put down as colleges and 
universities—all but 3 of which are avowedly denominational. Of 
the 16 institutions for negro women only, all but 3 are credited to 
some denomination. There are 354 normal, industrial, and private 
  
1 Negro Year Book for 1914-15, by Monroe N. Work.
-P-A-G-E-649
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 613 
schools, all but 80 of which are denominational. Many of the negro 
schools catalogued as nonsectarian are largely aided by the various 
religious bodies. 
Of the estimated $2,000,000 spent during 1912-13 on negro edu- 
cation, statistics show that the Methodist Episcopal Church gave 
$412,303; the Congregational Church, through the American Mis- 
sionary Association, gave $298,371; the Presbyterian churches, 
$248,106; the Baptist churches, $84,022; and the Protestant Episco- 
pal Church, $68,501. The remaining estimated $888,697 is divided 
mainly among the following denominations: The Roman Catholics, 
the Colored Baptist Association, the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church, the Disciples of Christ, the Colored Methodist Episcopal 
Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church South, the Lutheran 
Church, the Society of Friends, and the Seventh-day Adventists. 
As typical church organizations doing extensive work among 
negroes, the following are given: The American Missionary Associa- 
tion (Congregational) has 65 schools (31 of them given as elementary), 
12,097 students, $1,310,542 invested in school plants, and a perma- 
nent endowment fund of $2,016,861.1 The Freedmen’s Aid Society 
(Methodist Episcopal) has 22 schools (none given as elementary), 
6,588 students, $1,457,476 invested in school plants, and an endow- 
ment of $291,646. The American Baptist Home Mission Board has 
24 schools (none put down as elementary), 7,351 students, $1,261,000 
invested in school plants, with $436,340 in permanent endowment. 
The Board of Missions for Freedmen (Presbyterian) has 136 schools 
(112 given as elementary), 16,427 students, $939,200 invested in 
school plants, and $205,202 in permanent endowment.? 
The secretaries of the various church boards at their semiannual 
meeting in Washington, D. C.,° laid definite plans for the future in 
the following particulars: As far as possible there would be in future 
no duplications between private and public schools; sham education 
would not be condoned, and the various negro schools would be 
standardized; the denominations would act in concert in preventing 
schools under different denominational control from occupying the 
same territory. It was agreed among the representatives of the 
several churches of the conference that where two schools were un- 
necessary in the same section, the weaker would withdraw in favor 
of the stronger, or take some department of the school and thus 
work in harmony with the body controlling the school.

NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION? 
The fifty-second annual convention of the National Education 
Association was held at St. Paul, Minn., July 4-11, 1914. The presi- 
dential address of the year was delivered by Joseph Swain, president 
of Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, his subject being ‘‘The relation 
of the teacher to American citizenship.’’ The address was a plea for 
making the teacher more influential and more efficient by elevating 
his calling to the dignity of a profession. He advocated a living wage 
for teachers, a system of retirement allowances, a sabbatical year’s 
leave of absence for travel for teachers in the lower schools, and more 
positions as superintendents, principals, and boards of control for 
women engaged in teaching. President Swain’s address was followed 
by a paper entitled ‘‘The responsibility of American educators in the 
solution of America’s oriental problem,’’ by Sidney L. Gulick, pro- 
fessor in Doshisha University and lecturer in Imperial University at 
Kyoto, Japan. Mrs. Lois K. Mathews, of the University of Wiscon- 
sin, spoke on ‘‘Training women for social responsibility” by directly 
teaching in the colleges the necessity of social service and by devel- 
oping a sense of social responsibility. An active discussion took place 
on the subject of teachers’ salaries and pensions, which was partici- 
pated in by President Charles W. Dabney, University of Cincinnati; 
Grace C. Strachan, of Brooklyn, N. Y.; and Walter I. Hamilton, of 
Boston, Mass. The committee on teachers’ salaries and the cost of 
living, through its chairman, Joseph Swain, announced that its report

this year had been published by the U. S. Bureau of Education as 
Bulletin No. 16, 1914, under the title ‘‘Tangible Rewards of Teach- 
ing.” The committee also presented a supplementary report on ‘‘The 
public school teacher and the standard of living,’ prepared by Scott 
Nearing, of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Nearing said: 
There is probably no group of the population which is harder pressed by the nec- 
essary cost of living than are the school teachers. Teachers are unable to make pro- 
vision for exigencies. Their salaries are not sufficient to enable them to save adequate 
sums against ill health and old age. Beitsaid, by way of explanation, that ill health 
is alarmingly prevalent among school teachers. z 
He urged teachers as a body ‘‘to face the issue squarely, discover 
the cost of a fair standard of living, and insist that the teaching pro- 
fession receive salaries high enough to enable them to pay for that 
standard.”’ 
The general topic of principles and aims of education enlisted the 
attention of educators at the fourth session. President Alexander 
Meiklejohn, of Amherst College, Mass., read a paper on ‘The purpose 
of the liberal college,” in which he explained its function, its place in 
a complete system of education, and its vocational as well as general 
educational efficiency. 
At the fifth session, which was devoted to a discussion of the gen- 
eral topic, ‘‘Education in a democracy,” Dr. P. P. Claxton, United 
States Commissioner of Education, spoke on ‘‘Organization of edu- 
cation for democracy.” 
Edward A. Ross, of the University of Wisconsin, read a paper on 
‘‘Education for social service,’ in which he said that ‘‘the social 
service that is supreme is not some bit of charitable work, but the 
following of one’s calling as a service, not as an exploit.” 
At the closing session interesting addresses were delivered on the 
needs of the public schools. John W. Cook, of De Kalb, IIL, dis- 
cussed the professionally prepared teachers without whom no true 
progress can be made, and urged the multiplication of professional 
schools of pedagogy. President L. D. Harvey, of Stout Institute, 
Wis., spoke on ‘‘Systematic education for those pupils leaving school 
toosoon.” He deplored the condition of the children who leave school 
at the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades without a complete foundation 
in the three R’s and without hope of attaining any marketable knowl- 
edge or industrial skill. 
Great interest was manifested in the various departments, particu- 
larly in that devoted to vocational education. The committee on 
vocational education and vocational guidance, through its chairman, 
Robert J. Fuller, of North Attleboro, Mass., reported the result of its 
labors regarding the preparation of a terminology in vocational edu- 
cation. Arthur L. Williston, president of the department, delivered 
 
-P-A-G-E-653
  EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 617 
an address entitled “Should manual training and technical high 
schools abandon their general and college preparatory aims and 
become efficient secondary schools of applied science?’ To make 
the typical practical arts high school into an efficient secondary school 
of applied science, he advocated the following essential changes: (1) 
Elimination of all foreign languages; (2) confining the instruction 
almost exclusively to the laboratory method; (3) only such boys to 
be admitted to the school as have some reasonable likelihood of enter- 
ing occupations directly or indirectly related to industry after they 
leave the school; (4) lengthening the school day in order to provide 
time for new types of laboratory work and more constructive drawing 
and design; (5) one recitation and one double laboratory period 
every day during the entire four years for applied science and its 
applications to the various branches of industry. At least a double 
period every day should be devoted to shop practice and drawing, 
and in the latter part of the course, even more time for constructive 
drawing and genuine design. English, history, economics, and pure 
and applied mathematics should occupy the balance of the time. 
Mr. Williston laid emphasis on applied science and the applied science 
laboratory as the backbone of the school curriculum. 
DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, 
The department of superintendence of the National Education As- 
sociation, together with its 16 affiliated societies, convened in Rich- 
mond, Va., February 23-28, 1914. The meeting was distinguished 
by the spirit of scientific investigation, which was displayed in the 
papers presented for consideration. David Snedden and William C. 
Bagley discussed the subject of ‘Fundamental distinctions between 
liberal and vocational education” in papers that represent notable 
contributions to the current vocational problem. 
The subjects of school and shop work, the apprentice schools of the 
Santa Fe Railway System, and trade schools were discussed. The 
report of the committee on “Economy of time in education”? was 
rendered by the chairman, Harry B. Wilson, of Topeka, Kans. The 
report urged the testing out of various plans for economizing time 
as they may come to the attention of those in administrative positions. 
Walter A. Jessup, of the State University of Iowa, presented a paper 
illustrated with graphic statistics, on “Economy of time in arith- 
metic,” in which he called attention to the strong disposition ‘to 
favor increased emphasis on the application of arithmetic to the 
social and economic conditions of the day, such as saving and 
loaning of money, taxation, public expenditures, life insurance, etc.” 
Elwood P. Cubberley, of Leland Stanford Junior University, and 
Edward C. Elliott, of the University of Wisconsin, presented a 
 
-P-A-G-E-654
618 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
joint paper on “Rural school administration,’ which recommended 
radical changes in rural schools. They said: 
This will involve a county unit of organization, administration, and finances; the 
election of a lay county board of education, analogous to a city board of education, to 
select the experts and to determine the larger questions of policy and procedure; the 
substitution of an appointed for an elected superintendent, and the reorganization of 
the county administrative office along the lines of the best city adminstrative expe- 
rience; a redirection of the instruction to meet modern educational needs; and the 
training of a body of teachers for rural work who can and will render community as 
well as educational service. 
They thought that counties refusing to place their school systems 
on a proper educational fundation should be penalized by ‘‘a reduc- 
tion of the apportionment of State funds to no more than would be 
demanded for the same educational facilities now provided if 
regrouped under a proper educational reorganization.” 
At the closing session, Wallace Buttrick, secretary of ‘the General 
Education Board, New York City, described the work of the board. 
Resolutions were passed indorsing the movement to establish and 
sustain vocational schools for pupils over 14 years of age, likewise 
the founding of continuation schools for boys and girls between the 
ages of 14 and 18 years who have entered vocational life. It was 
recommended that attendance upon such continuation schools be 
made compulsory for boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16. 
It was urged that every rural school should provide a home, includ- 
ing a small farm, for the teacher. The importance of the proper 
teaching of sex hygiene was emphasized, the ideal place for impart- 
ing such instruction being the home. ‘‘If instruction in sex hygiene 
is to be given in school at all it should be given not to classes but to 
individuals, and by teachers specially qualified for such work.”   
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION, 
The National Council of Education at its meeting in Richmond, 
Va., February 23-24, 1914, discussed the topic of ‘‘Health problems 
in the American public schools,” under two heads: (1) Plans for 
promoting improvement in the sanitation of rural schools; (2) 
Supervision and care of personal health of pupils in rural schools. 
The report of the committee on ‘‘Tests and standards of efficiency 
in schools and schools systems—A brief statement concerning the 
purpose, nature, and conduct of school surveys” was made by the 
chairman, George D. Strayer, of Teachers College, Columbia Uni- 
versity, New York City. 
The topic of sex hygiene was fully treated at this meeting. Edu- 
cational surveys also received attention. 
At the meeting of the council in St. Paul, Minn., July 4-8, 1914, 
the problem of ‘‘Cooperating forces for the improvement of rural 
 
-P-A-G-E-655
     EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 619 
school conditions” was presented. The topics of ‘‘Superintendent 
problems”’; ‘‘Harmonizing vocational and cultural education’; and 
“Heonomy of time in education” were considered. Arthur H. Cham- 
berlain, of California, made a strong plea for the substitution of the 
county for the district unit in country schools and a change in the 
manner of electing superintendents. Supt. John W. Carr, of Bayonne, 
N. J., dwelt on the need of a more efficient standard for the superin- 
tendency and of better methods of supervision, pointing to more 
scientific programs of study, exact measurements of teaching results, 
and a higher educational standard. He said there was little induce- 
ment for a person to prepare thoroughly for the position of city 
superintendent if the tenure was insecure. 
NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF EDUCATION. 
The National Society for the Study of Education met at Richmond, 
Va., February 23, 1914, on which occasion there was an animated 
discussion of the thirteenth yearbook of the organization, which 
dealt with problems concerning the high schools. The title of this 
yearbook is ‘‘Some Aspects of High-School Instruction and Adminis- 
tration.” The first paper, entitled ‘‘Reconstructed mathematics,” 
by H. C. Morrison, State superintendent of schools of New Hampshire, 
was discussed by David Snedden, commissioner of education for 
Massachusetts, and P. Johnson, of the Woodward High School, 
Cincinnati, Ohio. Supt. Morrison thought that the traditional round 
of mathematics in the high school must be revised both as ‘‘to organ- 
ization and content, and adapted to the known nature of the ado- 
lescent and to the social purpose of the high school as that purpose is 
increasingly revealed by modern conditions.” 
The second paper by E. R. Breslich, of the University High School, 
University of Chicago, entitled ‘‘Supervised study as a means of 
providing supplementary individual instruction,” was discussed by 
C. H. Judd, director of the school of education, University of Chicago; 
and by J. S. Brown, superintendent of the Township High School, 
Joliet, Il. Mr. Breslich discussed the various plans that have been 
proposed and tried out to provide individual instruction to supple- 
ment class instruction, and the efforts made to give pupils assistance 
while they are studying and training them in habits of study. He 
said that one of the best means to attain both of these ends was the 
provision of organized periods of study, for the purpose of supervising 
individual pupils who are studying silently. He described the ex- 
periments that have been organized during the past 25 years to 
provide for individual differences during class instruction, such as 
the Pueblo plan, the Batavia scheme, etc. 
The concluding paper, entitled ‘‘North central high schools,” by 
Walter A. Jessup, of the State University of Iowa, and L. D. Coffman, 
    
-P-A-G-E-656
   
     
620 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
of the University of Illinois, was discussed by the latter. The results 
of the investigation are summarized as follows: 
1. Standards determined by definition are not uniformly applied in practice. 
2. The problem of administering a system of schools varies in complexity according 
to the size of the commuuity, the enrollment of the school, the size of the classes, the 
number of classes, and the character of the teacher. 
3. The number of recitations and the potential flexibility of the curriculum and 
variety of appeals afforded in a given type of schools increase in direct ratio to the 
size of the community represented. 
4. Feminization increases as the amount of executive work decreases. 
5. Expectancy as expressed in salaries and tenure increases with the size of the 
place. 
6. Professionalization in teaching rests at present with the more experienced 
teachers in the larger places. 
H. L. Smith, superintendent of schools, Bloomington, Ind., read a 
paper on ‘“The organization of school surveys in towns and cities,” 
in anticipation of the yearbook in preparation by the same author. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGIATE ALUMN. 
The thirty-second general meeting of the Association of Collegiate 
Alumnz was held in Philadelphia April 13-17, 1914. May Treat 
Morrison, president, delivered an address on the history and policies 
of the association, with an outlook into the future, in which she 
spoke of the expediency of organizing an academic group within the 
association. Among the numerous resolutions offered was one 
indorsing the efforts of the Richmond branch of the Southern Asso- 
ciation of College Women, and the men and women residents of Vir- 
ginia, to establish a coordinate college for women at the University 
of Virginia. 
At the conference of deans of women held at Bryn Mawr, Pa., 
April 14, 1914, the general opinion was expressed that extra cur- 
riculum activities constitute an important part of student life, but in 
order that they may not be carried to such excess that health and 
academic work suffer therefrom, the following suggestions were 
offered as to methods of restricting them: 
(a) The point system, either as carried out by the students themselves or enforced 
by the faculty. (6) The basing of eligibility for any office on the record of the pre- 
vious semester and the number of hours and grade of work carried on at the time. 
(c) The estimating of various extra curriculum activities in terms of academic hours 
with a view to keeping the combined total of curriculum and extra-curriculum hours 
within a definite limit. (d) The possible elimination of many existing organizations 
which seem to have no definite value to either the university or the student. (e) The 
limiting of the purely social activities to certain days and hours. 
ASSOCIATION OF HISTORY TEACHERS OF THE MIDDLE STATES AND 
MARYLAND. 
A conference of the Association of History Teachers of the Middle 
States and Maryland was held at Albany, N. Y., on November 29,
-P-A-G-E-657
      
   
      
            EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 621 
1913. J. Lynn Barnard presented a timely paper on ‘‘The teaching 
of civics in the elementary schools,’ in which he explained the 
method of teaching civics in the Practice School, of Philadelphia. 
He said: 
Civics is itself a life—a growth—a point of view—democracy in the making. This 
means, first, that the work in civics must be given adequate time in the school cur- 
riculum; and, second, that the work must be continuous and cumulative, throughout 
the first eight years of school life. 
James Sullivan, of the Boys’ High School, Brooklyn, N. Y., spoke 
on ‘‘Civics in the high school and training for citizenship,” and 
Charles A. Beard, of Columbia University, on ‘Training for citizen- 
ship.” Interesting discussions followed these papers. Resolutions 
were adopted regarding the teaching of civics in elementary and 
secondary schools and colleges. Concerning the elementary and 
secondary schools, it was urged that means be found for the actual 
participation of the students in civic activities. Visits to courts and 
public buildings are not sufficient; students ‘‘should do something 
to help, either as individuals or through civic associations.”’ It was 
also urged that the association should provide methods to secure 
separate examinations for United States history and civics. Exam- 
ination questions in civics should require something besides a knowl- 
edge of the machinery of government. As regards colleges, actual 
research in political science should be undertaken; and participation 
in public activities should be more extended and on a higher plane. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF THE 
SOUTHERN STATES. 
The nineteenth annual meeting of the Association of Colleges and 
Secondary Schools of the Southern States was held at Knoxville, 
Tenn., November 6-7, 1913. The general theme of the first day was 
“The status of the vocational subjects,” discussed under the follow- 
ing heads: (a) ‘‘Their disciplinary value,’ by J. J. Foster, of the 
University of Alabama; (b) ‘(In the rural schools,” by N. W. Walker, 
of the University of North Carolina; (c) ‘‘In the city schools,’ by 
Harry Clark, University of Tennessee; and (d) “Their standardiza- 
tion and acceptance for admission to college,’ by W. H. Hand, of 
South Carolina. These papers evidenced a remarkable development 
of vocational subjects in our schools. J. L. Henderson, of the Uni- 
versity of Texas, delivered an address on ‘‘Changes in college entrance 
requirements,” which considered especially changes in obedience to 
religious, social, and economic demands. After an interesting his- 
torical résumé of the subject, he said: 
The experiences of the past 40 years have settled one question: The colleges can not 
successfully resist the demand for the acceptance of new subjects. Then what atti- 
tude shall they assume in the matter? They must do for the new subject just what
-P-A-G-E-658
  622 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
they have done for the older ones; they must assist in the development and standardi- 
zation of the vocational work. The work in the new subjects may be improved in 
four ways: (1) By providing adequately trained teachers; (2) by aiding the schools 
in the organization of courses of study; (3) by suggestion of suitable equipment; and 
(4) by careful inspection of the work. 
A number of excellent papers were read at the second day’s sessions, 
among them being ‘‘What may this association do for institutions 
further advanced than secondary schools, but not. doing full college 
work?’ by George W. Lay, of Raleigh, N. C. After considerable 
discussion, the executive committee was directed to take the whole 
theme under advisement and prepare a report upon the subject. 
The report of the commission on accredited schools was read by 
the chairman, Joseph S. Stewart, of the University of Georgia. The 
commission decided not to make— 
any recommendations this year as to changes in the content of the several units now 
in general use. As recommended at the Spartanburg meeting, the vocational subjects 
have been listed and space provided on the official blanks for reporting the same. In 
listing these the commission was guided somewhat by the action of the North Central 
Association’s definitions of these subjects. These standards can be found in the North 
Central Reports. The commission recommends that not more than 4 such voca- 
tional units out of 14 or 15 required for entrance be accepted for any one student 
by the colleges of the Southern association. 
Papers of interest were read by Charles G. Maphis, of the Uni- 
versity of Virginia, on ‘A decade of growth in secondary education 
in the Southern States’; and by Elizabeth A. Colton, of Meredith 
College, on “‘The approximate value of recent degrees of Southern 
colleges.” 
CATHOLIC EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The eleventh annual meeting of the Catholic Educational Associa- 
tion was held at Atlantic City, N. J., June 29 to July 2, 1914. Very 
Rev. James A. Burns, Ph. D., president of Holy Cross College, 
Washington, D. C., spoke on the ‘Correlation and the teaching of 
religion,’ declaring that it remained for Herbart “to sum up and 
translate the psychological facts and laws of association for the 
teacher, in his theory of apperception, of which the most important 
practical principle is, probably, that of the correlation of studies.” 
He remarked that the Catholic ideal, in regard to religious instruction 
in the school, is in perfect harmony with this elementary law of 
association, as laid down by psychologists, and elaborated and given 
pedagogical application by Herbart. The correlation of religion 
with all other topics of the curriculum was the particular theme of 
his discourse. 
In an address on liberal education, Very Rev. Augustine Stocker, 
O. S. B., protested against “the fallacy of measuring the value of an 
educational curriculum by its relation to immediate practical results 
or by the multitude of studies it comprises.” He said that general 
 
-P-A-G-E-659
  
EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 623 
culture should come before specialized studies, thereby freeing the 
mind of the specialist from narrowness. Extensive scientific study, 
he thought, ought to suppose an A. B. degree with all it implies; 
there were many far-seeing educators, both in the Catholic Church 
and out of it, who with Prof. Miinsterberg, would denominate many 
modern school-reforms ‘school deteriorations.” 
Brother John B. Nichol, 8. M., of St. Michael’s School, Brooklyn, 
N. Y., discussed the subject of ‘Present-day tendencies in edu- 
cation,”’ the most important and notable of which he classified as 
belonging to organization, to administration, to the curriculum, 
and to methods. Concerning organization, he said that the most 
noteworthy tendency is indicated in the efforts to distribute the 
time allotments for elementary and secondary studies; in adminis- 
tration of school systems, the most pronounced tendency is the 
centralization of control in both city and rural schools; in the curric- 
ulum, the tendency toward vocational education; and as regards 
methods, the tendency toward psychological pedagogy. 
The Rev. Albert Muntsch, S. J., of St. Louis University, presented 
an interesting paper on “The relation of vocational to nonvocational 
courses,’ which was discussed at length by Brother G. Philip, F. S. 
C., and Brother Bernardine. Brother J. A. Waldron, S. M., dis- 
cussed ‘The organization of a diocesan school system”; and Sister 
Margaret Mary, Order of Mercy, ‘‘The advantages of a central 
Catholic high school.” 
In the college department of the association an address of wel- 
come was made by Very Rev. Joseph F. Green, O. S. A., who dis- 
cussed legislation that attempts ‘to curtail or utterly deny liberty 
of education.” He deprecated the efforts of educational foundations, 
financed by private interests, to have the State and National Goy- 
ernments ‘exercise paternal supervision over all things educational.” 
The chairman of the language and literature section, Rev. F. P. 
Donnelly, S. J., made a brief but interesting report, in which he 
declared that the classical languages are still the most effective 
instruments for developing the faculties of man and imparting a 
liberal education. He believed, however, that enthusiastic and 
practical instruction in English should accompany the study of the 
classics. It was his opinion that language study should form the 
principal subject of the college and high school. 
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF INSTRUCTION. 
The eighty-third annual meeting of the American Institute of In- 
struction was held in Cambridge, Mass., July 1-3, 1914. Many 
notable addresses were made dealing with vital questions in edu- 
cation. David Snedden, commissioner of education of Massachu- 
setts, presented an able paper on “Problems of elementary educa-  
-P-A-G-E-660
  624 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
tion,’ in which he drew a comparison between the education of 
to-day with that of a generation ago. He emphasized some of the 
definite problems which should be made “a matter of attack” by 
educators generally under the following heads: (1) Definition of 
the aims of certain subjects—history, geography, elementary science, 
drawing, grammar, and manual arts in elementary schools; (2) the 
organization of definite units of instruction; (3) distinction between 
learning for the sake of doing and learning for the sake of apprecia- 
tion; (4) distinction between upper and lower grade work. In 
regard to the first, he said that instead of well-defined aims we 
have a variety of guesses or aspirations as to what educational 
values should result from such studies. 
H.C. Morrison, State superintendent of New Hampshire, spoke 
on ‘Problems of secondary education.” He stated that the pro- 
gram of every secondary school in the New England States should 
be planned with regard to— 
the needs of the community in which it is placed. It ought to be able to serve 
that community by ministering in its laboratories and shops to the whole common 
life of the community, and it ought with equal devotion to be the center of the whole 
higher life of the town. 
The ‘Problems of rural schools’? was discussed by Mason S. 
Stone, superintendent of education of Vermont. James F. Hosic, 
of Chicago, in his paper on “Waste in education,” said that effi- 
ciency engineers are needed in education quite as much as in build- 
ing. Frank W. Ballou presented a paper on ‘The significance of 
educational measurement,’’ in which he declared that the movement 
for measuring the results in education is but one phase of a larger 
movement for increased efficiency in all departments of human 
endeavor. He said that a new science of education was being 
erected upon these investigations. 
James E. Peabody, of the Morris High School, New York City, in an 
able paper, dwelt on the “Relation of biology to human welfare,” 
emphasizing in particular the sex question. Robert O. Small, of the 
Massachusetts State Board of Education, in an address on the influ- 
ence of vocational education upon the conventional curriculum, said 
that in education there were to be considered the cultural aim, the 
social aim, and the vocational aim. Vocational education will con- 
tribute to the regular schools by vitalizing the programs in those par- 
ticulars which aim to make the pupil self-supporting; by correlating 
the teaching with political, industrial, and commercial conditions; 
and by demonstrating the fact that there are sources of culture in 
vocational instruction too little recognized by regular school programs. 
Arthur W. Dunn, of the United States Bureau of Education, dis-

Many excellent papers were read and discussed in the various 
conferences on special topics. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE— 
SECTION L. 
The educational section of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science met in Philadelphia in December, 1914. Prof. 
Paul Hanus, of Harvard University, presided. The regular program 
was devoted to educational measurement and the exceptional child. 
Sessions were also held with the American Psychological Association 
and with the American Federation of Science and Mathematical 
Teachers. Dr. P. P. Claxton, as retiring vice president, delivered 
an address on ‘‘The American rural school,” in which he advocated 
a very large increase in the average length of school term and a 
nearer approach to equality in length of term in all such schools. He 
emphasized higher standards of preparation for rural school teachers, 
because they have more difficult tasks to perform and consequently 
require more thorough and comprehensive preparation for their duties 
than city teachers. Among the papers read were ‘ Educational 
research—the functions of a department of educational investigation 
and measurement in a city school system,’ by Frank W. Ballou; 
“The selection and training of the exceptionally able child,’ by 
David S. Hill; ‘The training of teachers for exceptional children,” 
by Lightner Witmer; and “The cost of teaching exceptional chil- 
dren,”’ by Leonard P. Ayres. 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION. 
The fourth annual convention of the National League of Compul- 
sory Education was held in Detroit, Mich., November 20-21, 1914. 
William L. Bodine, of Chicago, delivered the presidential address. 
James B. Quinn, of St. Louis, Mo., read a paper on ‘Following up 
children who work, and the problem of vocational guidance.” He 
rehearsed the vocational methods in vogue in various parts of the 
country, dwelling particularly on what was being accomplished in the 
city of St. Louis. Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, of Chicago, presented a 
paper on “The opportunities of modern education,” in which she 
emphasized prevocational work. W. 8S. Deffenbaugh, of the United 
States Bureau of Education, spoke on the ‘‘ Value of cooperating with 
the United States Bureau of Education, in collecting statistics,” in 
which he briefly summarized the history, organization and work of 
the bureau, and dwelt on the advantages of cooperating with it.

  626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. | 
The Bureau of Education, he said, gives wider publicity to a study 
than apy organization not Governmental can possibly do. Very little 
has been accomplished in studying the multifarious problems con- 
nected with the enforcement of the compulsory education laws; and 
the few investigations that have been undertaken have not been dis- 
tributed free to compulsory attendance officers and to city and county 
superintendents. 
The subject of the ‘‘Minimum educational and age qualifications 
for employment permits’ was treated by Supt. Charles E. Chadsey, 
of Detroit, Mich. He remarked that it was the duty of compulsory 
education officials to spread the doctrine that all training is radically 
insufficient until the eighth grade is reached. Paul Kreuzpointner, 
of Altoona, Pa., discussing the ‘‘Unconsidered factors in industrial 
education,’’ said that what mostly concerns us to-day in the United 
States is to discover a social-economic basis upon which the millions 
of industrial workers can— 
rest securely and contentedly with justice to their rights as citizens, so as not to 
endanger the stability of our institutions and the peace and order of public life. 
Industrial education is much more a social-economic problem, an ethical problem 
in training for intelligent citizenship, than it is a problem in training in the manipu- 
lation of tools, however valuable and necessary this is. 
H. R. Pestalozzi, of Milwaukee, Wis., made an address on ‘‘ Where 
shall our work begin and where shall it end?” speaking from the 
viewpoint of a truant officer. 
Resolutions were passed advocating uniform and adequate birth- 
registration laws; the establishment and maintenance of a perma- 
nent census bureau in every city of the United States; and in favor 
of the unit system of control of industrial education rather than the 
dual system. 
CONFERENCE ON THE EDUCATION OF BACKWARD, TRUANT, DELIN- 
QUENT, AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
The tenth annual conference on the education of backward, truant, 
delinquent, and dependent children was held in Buffalo, N. Y., 
August 26-28, 1913. The first session was opened by Elmer L. 
Coffeen, of Westboro, Mass., who spoke on ‘‘The correlation of 
school and trade work.” The second session, held conjointly with 
the National Probation Association, developed an interesting gen- 
eral discussion on the problems of delinquent and defective children. 
At the fourth session, Lewis M. Terman, of Leland Stanford Uni- 
versity, made an address on ‘‘Special characteristics of the Binet- 
Simon test,’’ which dealt with the psychological principles under- 
lying the Binet-Simon scale. At the fifth session, a paper on “A 
State’s program for the defectives” was read by Alexander Johnson, 
 
-P-A-G-E-663
  EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 627 
of the Training School at Vineland, N. J. Many interesting photo- 
graphs of feeble-minded children were presented to illustrate the 
author’s theme. Mr. Johnson remarked that one of the very best 
kinds of work for the feeble-minded, especially the boys, is to clear 
and subdue waste land. He spoke of the work accomplished at the 
Vineland school. The subject of ‘‘Mothers’ pensions” was treated 
at the sixth session by Robert W. Hebbard, of New York; and at 
the closing session the “Care of delinquent girls as to discipline and 
vocational training”? was ably presented by Mrs. Amy F. Everall, of 
Lancaster, Mass., who thought that vocational training in its tech- 
nical sense has no real place with young or mentally or morally 
weak girls. She said: ‘‘It is only efficient where girls are mature and 
have fundamental grounding in education.” ‘‘Sex hygiene in its 
relation to vocational training and the defective delinquent’? was 
discussed by Mrs. E. A. Whitney, of Washington, D. C. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL ACCOUNTING OFFICERS. 
The third annual convention of the National Association of School 
Accounting Officers was held in Memphis, Tenn., May 19-21, 1914. 
The subject of ‘School accounting from the standpoint of the needs 
of the Bureau of Education’? was discussed by Dr. P. P. Claxton, 
who dwelt upon the responsibility which devolves upon boards of 
school control for the economical and scientific expenditure of public 
funds in the administration of public schools. He spoke of the 
Bureau of Education and its methods of compiling statistics; and 
its dependency upon the association for much of the information 
published in its reports. Henry R. M. Cook, of New York, president 
of the association, delivered an address entitled ‘‘Some school 
affairs,” in which he discussed teachers’ pensions and other problems 
of school administration. An instructive paper on ‘‘Standard units 
of school measurements” was read by George W. Gerwig, of Pitts- 
burgh, Pa. The concluding address of the convention was delivered 
by Charles P. Mason, of St. Louis, Mo., on ‘‘Preparation of the 
budget,” in which he gave an exposition of the budgets of the States 
and municipalities as well as boards of education. He made a com- 
parison of methods and procedure between American and European 
municipalities, with regard to the passing and administering of the 
budget. 
GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD. 
The General Education Board, the functions of which comprise 
the advancement of practical farming and the development of a 
system of public high schools in the Southern States, likewise the 
promotion of higher education throughout the United States, has,
-P-A-G-E-664
    628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
since its foundation in 1902, rendered annual statements of its 
activities to the United States Department of the Interior, brief 
extracts from which have been regularly published in the year- 
books of the Bureau of Education. These statements have been, 
for the most part, financial in character. No report of an elaborate 
nature has been issued in past years, owing to the fact that the board 
considered its enterprises to be experimental; it desired to avoid 
premature expositions regarding the scope and outcome of its labors. 
However, after something more than a decade, the board in February, 
1915, published a volume of 240 pages, giving a complete account of 
its activities, from its inception in the year 1902 up to June 30, 1914. 
The General Education Board, founded by John D. Rockefeller, 
was incorporated by act of Congress, January 12, 1903. The charter 
set forth the general purpose of the corporation as ‘‘the promotion 
of education within the United States of America, without distinction 
of race, sex, or creed.” As the report says: 
This broad object was specifically stated to include the power to establish or endow 
elementary or primary schools, industrial schools, technical schools, normal schools, 
training schools for teachers, or schools of any grade, or higher institutions of learning; 
to cooperate with associations engaged in educational work; to donate property or 
money to any such association; to collect educational statistics and information; to 
publish and distribute documents and reports; and in general to do and perform all 
things necessary or convenient for the promotion of the object of the corporation: 
The report gives an interesting résumé of the work of the Peabody 
education fund, the John F. Slater fund, and the Southern Education 
Board in upbuilding education in the South since the War. It cites 
the fact that— 
neither they nor the General Education Board ever possessed or sought authority; 
they have simply had such influence as has resulted from public confidence in their 
disinterested devotion, sympathy, and intelligence. More flexible than govern- 
mental bureaus, less restricted in their choice of agents and advisers, more continuous 
in policy, these organizations have for years devoted themselves to furthering educa- 
tional plans which represent the consensus of the best judgment obtainable. 
Prior to the actual incorporation, Mr. Rockefeller gave $1,000,000 
to the General Education Board, stipulating that the principal be 
used in promoting the educational interests of the people of the 
Southern States, and that it be expended during a period of 10 years. 
The first permanent endowment of $10,000,000 was received June 
30, 1905, and was designed to furnish an income— 
to be distributed to, or used for the benefit of, such institutions of learning, at such 
times, in such amounts, for such purposes, and under such conditions, or employed 
in such other ways as the board may deem best adapted to promote a comprehensive 
system of higher education in the United States. 
In February, 1907, Mr. Rockefeller made a further gift of 
$32,000,000; on July 7, 1909, an additional benefaction of $10,000,000. 
Besides the above-mentioned sums, the board received on April 17,
-P-A-G-E-665
  EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 629 
1905, the sum of $200,000 from Miss Anna T. Jeanes for the assist- 
ance of the negro rural schools in the South. 
The resources of the board at the present time are estimated at 
$33,939,156.89, of which $30,918,063.80 constitutes a general en- 
dowment fund and $3,021,093.09 a reserve fund. The gross income 
from these funds for 1913-14 was $2,417,079.62; the Anna T. 
Jeanes fund yielded a gross income of $9,231.64. 
The appropriations of the board up to June 30, 1914, have been as 
follows: Colleges and universities, $10,582,591.80; medical schools, 
$2,670,874.11; negro colleges and schools, $699,781.13; miscella- 
neous schools, $159,991.02; professors of secondary education, 
$242,861.09; Southern Education Board, $97,126.23; rural school 
agents (both races), $104,443.18; farm demonstration work—South 
(including boys’ and girls’ clubs), $925,750; farm demonstration 
work—Maine and New Hampshire (including boys’ and girls’ clubs), 
$50,876.45; rural organization service, $37,166.66; educational con- 
ferences, $18,108.23; administrative expenses, $304,794.99; total, 
$15,894,364.89. 
A considerable part of the report is devoted to farm demonstration 
work in the South. Unfavorable economic conditions have been 
responsible for much rural poverty. ‘It was obvious,” says the 
report, “that the General Education Board could render no sub- 
stantial educational service to the South until the farmers of the 
South could provide themselves with larger incomes.” A lack of 
scientific knowledge of agriculture was apparent, and the board there- 
fore determined to undertake the task of educating the farmer, on the 
theory that, if he could be substantially assisted, he would gladly and 
more liberally support better schools. An extensive investigation was 
made as to the most efficient means of conveying to the average agri- 
culturist of the South, in his manhood, the most efficient known meth- 
ods of intelligent farming. This inquiry resulted in the extension of 
the so-called cooperative farm demonstration movement. The sery- 
ices of Dr. Seaman A. Knapp were engaged. Dr. Knapp knew that 
through seed selection and intensive farming the productivity of lands 
could be immensely increased. In farming communities that had 
been afflicted with the boll weevil he undertook to propagate his 
methods by actual demonstrations of their value. He sought to teach 
farmers not only how to raise cotton and corn, but how “to conduct 
farming as a business, how to ascertain the cost of a crop, how to find 
out whether they were making or losing money.” The boys’ and 
girls’ corn and canning clubs were outgrowths of the demonstration 
idea. ‘The Southern club movements,” says the report, ‘may con- 
tain the germ of the solution of the vocational problem in the rural 
districts.” The remarkable work of the United States Department 
of Agriculture in the agricultural uplift of the South is commented on. 
 
-P-A-G-E-666
    630 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The appropriations of the General Education Board in connection 
with the secondary educational movement of the South totaled 
$242,861.09. 
An interesting part of the report is devoted to colleges and uni- 
versities. It is illustrated with graphic statistics. The attention of 
the board as regards the question of higher education has been con- 
centrated on what is ordinarily known as “the department or 
faculty of arts and sciences—the core of the American college or 
university.”’ Only within the year 1914 has it undertaken to deal 
with one of the professional schools, viz, medicine. The sum of 
$1,500,000, named the “‘ William H. Welch endowment for clinical 
education and research,’ was appropriated to further clinical teach- 
ing at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., where it was 
proposed to organize the main clinical departments of medicine, 
surgery, and pediatrics on the full-time or university basis. The 
board has also cooperated with Washington University, St. Louis, 
Mo., appropriating $750,000 toward $1,500,000 for the endowment of 
university departments in medicine, surgery, and pediatrics. The 
sum of $500,000 was given to Yale University medical department 
toward the reorganization of the main clinical departments on the 
full-time basis. The board authorized the expenditure of not exceed- 
ing $45,000 during the current year for the salaries and expenses of 
rural education agents in 11 Southern States, and resolved further to 
extend similar offers to selected States in the North, East, and West. 
It is the duty of such agents to assist in making complete and dis- 
passionate surveys of rural education in their respective States, in- 
cluding laws, organization, finance, equipment, teaching force, and 
methods, etc., cooperating with other organizations and agencies and 
working under the direction of the State departments of education. 
The General Education Board has made appropriations to negro 
colleges and universities as follows: Atlanta University, $8,000; 
Florida Baptist Academy, $13,000; Fisk University, $70,000; Lane 
College, $7,000; Livingstone College, $12,000; Shaw University, 
$18,000; Virginia Union University, $11,500; total, $140,000. Speak-" 
ing of the higher education, the report says: 
A higher education ought to be furnished to capable negro men and women; but the 
mere attempt to deliver the traditional college curriculum to the negro does not con- 
stitute a higher education. His own needs, environment, capacity, and opportunity 
should be fully studied, and college curricula should be framed in the light of the facts 
thus elicited. Moreover, these curricula should all be regarded as experimental. 
Concentration on a reduced number of institutions is urged.

REPORT OF SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
Ann Arzor, Micu., August 31, 1914. 
Sir: Complying with the provisions of section 4 of the act of 
incorporation of the National Education Association by Congress, 
approved June 30, 1906, the following is submitted as an annual 
report: 
An office is maintained in the city of Washington at 662 E Street 
NE., in accordance with section 8 of the act of incorporation, but 
the association owns no property, real or personal, in the city of 
Washington. 
The personal property of the association is largely in the form of 
volumes of proceedings, pamphlets, reprints, and office furniture, 
worth about $12,000, all of which is in the custody of the secretary, 
in Ann Arbor, Mich., where the business of the association is 
transacted. 
The association has a permanent invested fund, referred to in 
section 7 of the act of incorporation, which is in charge of the board 
of trustees. This fund at the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1914, 
amounted to $188,000. The net revenue from this fund amounted 
to $7,444.08, which was transferred to the treasury of the association 
for current expenses. 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1914, the total receipts from 
all sources, including balance at the beginning, were $32,343.15; the 
total expenses were $32,194.45; the balance in the treasury June 30, 
1914, was $148.70. 
The chief sources of revenue are membership fees, proceeds of sale 
of volumes and reports, and income from the invested fund. 
The chief items of expense are the printing and distribution of the 
annual volumes, the maintenance of the secretary’s office, and the 
expense of preparing for and conducting the annual convention. 
The usual appropriations for educational investigations were made 
at the time of the convention, which was held in St. Paul, Minn., 
July 4-11, 1914. The registered attendance was 6,548. 
The geiteal sessions and the sessions of the departments were well 
attended, and the programs presented were of the usual standard of 
excellence. 
The following general officers were elected for the ensuing year: 
President, David Starr Jordan, of Stanford University, Cal.; vice 
president, Joseph Swain, of Swarthmore, Pa.; treasurer, Grace M. 
Shepherd, of Boise, Idaho. 
The executive committee for the ensuing year will be constituted 
as follows: President, David Starr Jordan, chancellor of Leland 
Stanford Junior University, Stanford University, Cal.; first vice  
-P-A-G-E-668

president, Joseph Swain, president of Swarthmore College, Swarth- 
more, Pa.; treasurer, Grace M. Shepherd, State superintendent of 
public instruction, Boise, Idaho; chairman of trustees, Carroll G. 
Pearse, president of Milwaukee State Normal School, Milwaukee, 
Wis.; member by election, George B. Cook, State superintendent of 
y public instruction, Little Rock, Ark. 
The board of trustees for the ensuing year will be as follows: 
Chairman, Carroll G. Pearse, president of Milwaukee State Normal 
School, Milwaukee, Wis.; secretary, James Y. Joyner, State superin- 
| tendent of public instruction, Raleigh, N. C.; Robert J. Aley, presi- 
. dent of University of Maine, Orono, Me.; James M. Greenwood, 
Kansas City, Mo.; David Star Jordan, chancellor of Leland Stanford 
Junior University, Stanford University, Cal. 
In addition to the regular publications of the association, we 
desire to acknowledge the courtesy extended by the Bureau of Edu- 
cation in printing the following reports of our committees as a part of 
its series of bulletins: The report of the committee on standards and 
, tests for measuring the efficiency of schools or systems of schools, as 
) Bulletin No. 18, 1913; the report of the committee on economy of 
time in education, as Bulletin No. 38, 1913; preliminary report of 
the commission on the reorganization of secondary education, as 
Bulletin No. 41, 1913; and the report of the committee on teachers’ 
salaries and cost of living, as Bulletin No. 16, 1914, entitled ‘Tangible 
rewards of teaching.”

EDUCATION OF NATIVES OF ALASKA. 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1914, the field force of the 
Bureau of Education in Alaska consisted of 5 superintendents, 
1 assistant superintendent, 97 teachers, 9 physicians, 9 nurses, and 
3 hospital attendants. Seventy schools were maintained, with an 
enrolment of 3,666 and an average attendance of 1,991. 
In addition to performing the various duties included in the routine 
of their work, the employees of the Bureau of Education in Alaska 
must sometimes meet emergencies that do not confront school super- 
intendents and teachers in the United States. This was especially 
the case during the fiscal year 1913-14. On October 5 and 6, 1913, 
the town of Nome, with its adjacent coast, was visited by a severe 
storm that resulted in destruction of property and loss of life. Im- 
mediate action for the relief of the stricken natives was taken by 
Mr. Walter C. Shields, superintendent of schools in the northwestern 
district, assisted by the teachers. Subsequently a congressional 
resolution placed at the disposal of the Secretary of the Interior 
for the relief of those thus rendered destitute the sum of $2,455.52, 
the balance remaining of an appropriation made in 1912 to relieve 
suffering caused by the eruption of Mount Katmai, a volcano in 
southwestern Alaska. Of the sum thus appropriated, $1,500 was set 
aside for the relief of Eskimos and $955.52 for the relief of white 
persons, to be expended through the special disbursing agent of the 
Bureau of Education at Nome, under the direction of the superin- 
tendent of the northwestern district. 
In November, 1913, information was received of the prevalence 
of an epidemic of measles and of consequent destitution among 
the natives of Kodiak Island, Afognak Island, and of the Cook Inlet 
region, in southwestern Alaska. At the request of the Interior 
Department, the Treasury Department sent the revenue cutter 
Tahoma from Seattle to the stricken district, carrying an officer of the 
633 
    
-P-A-G-E-670
  6384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Public Health Service, medicines, disinfectants, and about 2 tons 
of food supplies furnished by the American Red Cross upon the 
request of the Bureau of Education. Dr. L. W. Jenkins, of the 
Public Health Service, and Dr. H. O. Schaleben, superintendent of 
schools in the southwestern district, visited the villages in which 
the disease prevailed, and, with the cooperation of the teachers, 
extended medical relief to the sufferers, and after the outbreak had 
been checked fumigated all infected places. Owing to these vigor- 
ous measures the deaths were kept down to about 80. The effects 
of the epidemic were especially felt in the village of Seldovia, where 
it was necessary for the teacher to distribute food to the famishing 
people for some weeks after the disease had disappeared. 
During the winter of 1913-14 an outbreak of infantile paralysis 
occurred at Tanana and its vicinity, also at Crossjacket, in the upper 
Yukon district. In the absence of a physician of the Bureau of 
Education, the commanding officer at Fort Gibbon kindly allowed one 
of the nurses of the Hospital Corps of the Army to assist Mr. George 
E. Boulter, superintendent of schools in the upper Yukon district, in 
maintaining quarantine and in taking other action necessary for the 
suppression of the disease. This epidemic was the cause of many 
deaths among the natives, and left several natives incurably 
paralyzed. 
In the spring of 1914 the breaking up of the ice in the Yukon River 
caused a serious flood at Circle City, which inundated the native 
village and did considerable damage to the school building. 
Tuberculosis, pneumonia, rheumatism, and venereal diseases 
prevail to an alarming extent in many of the native villages. Investi- 
gations conducted by Passed Asst. Surg. Emil Krulish, detailed for 
service in Alaska, show that at least 15 per cent of the native popula- 
tion of Alaska is infected with tuberculosis in its varying forms, both 
active and latent, while in 7 per cent it is present in its active stages. 
As knowledge of health conditions among the natives of Alaska 
becomes more definite, the need for larger funds for medical relief 
becomes more urgent. The endeavors of the bureau to secure from 
Congress a specific appropriation for the support of an adequate 
medical service in Alaska have not yet met with success. In order 
to meet the imperative demands of the medical work, it has been 
necessary from time to time to increase the amount taken from the 
education fund. To provide the additional money demanded by the 
medical work, six of the schools in the smaller villages, with a popula- 
tion of approximately 800, had to be closed, at the beginning of the 
fiscal year. With the sole uplifting agency thus removed, there is 
danger that these villages will drift back to the deplorable conditions 
that prevailed before the schools were established. 
 
-P-A-G-E-671
        EDUCATION OF NATIVES OF ALASKA, 635 
Of the appropriation for the education of natives of Alaska for 
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1914, more than $36,000 was used in 
employing nine physicians and nine nurses; in maintaining improvised 
hospitals at Nulato, Kotzebue, and Kanakanak; in payments under 
contracts with St. Ann’s Hospital at Juneau, with the Good Samaritan 
Hospital at Valdez, with the Holy Cross Hospital at Nome, and with 
the Fairhaven Hospital at Candle, for the treatment of natives who 
are destitute; also, as heretofore, in furnishing the teachers of the 
United States public schools with medicines and medical books in 
order to enable them to treat minor ailments. 
The act of May 17, 1884, providing a civil government for Alaska, 
stipulated that the natives should not be disturbed in the possession 
of any land used or occupied by them. However, with the influx 
of white men the village sites, hunting grounds, and fishing waters 
frequented by the natives from time immemorial have often been 
invaded, native settlements exploited by unscrupulous traders, and 
the pristine health and vigor of the natives sapped by the white 
man’s diseases and by the white man’s liquor. To protect the 
natives, the Bureau of Education has adopted the policy of requesting 
the reservation by Executive order, now, before Alaska becomes 
more thickly settled by white immigrants, of carefully selected tracts 
to which large numbers of natives can be attracted, and within 
which, secure from the intrusions of unscrupulous white men, the 
natives can obtain fish and game and conduct their own industrial 
and commercial enterprises. To the humanitarian reasons supporting 
this policy are added the practical considerations that within such 
reservations the Bureau of Education can concentrate its work, and 
more effectively and economically influence a larger number of natives 
than it can reach in the small and widely separated villages. Such 
reservations have been made of Annette Island, of St. Lawrence 
Island, and of tracts of land at Hydaburg, Klawock, Fort Yukon, 
Klukwan, Port Gravina, Fish Bay, Long Bay, and on the banks of 
the Kobuk River. : 
Formerly it was possible for the Eskimos on the shores of Bering 
Sea and the Arctic Ocean and in other remote regions of Alaska to 
dispose of their valuable furs, ivory, and whalebone only to the local 
traders, with the result that the natives usually received low prices 
for their commodities and were constantly in debt to the local traders. 
Availing themselves of the parcels-post service and of the increased 
opportunities to send freight, many Eskimos who have been educated 
in the schools now forward packages of fox, lynx, and mink skins, 
and ivory and whalebone to the office of the Alaska Division in Seattle, 
which, through the Seattle Fur Sales Agency, sells the furs at public 
auction, in accordance with the rules governing such sales, with the
-P-A-G-E-672
   
   636 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
result that many natives are now receiving full value for their goods. 
The proceeds of all sales are sent to the individual natives, applied 
to the settlement of their accounts with the Seattle merchants, or 
placed to their credit in savings banks, as requested, and detailed 
account is kept of all transactions. The net proceeds of the furs, 
ivory, and whalebone thus sold in Seattle for the natives during the 
fiscal year ended June-30, 1914, was $4,615.90. 
The captain of the vessel which for the past seven years has made 
the annual delivery of supplies to settlements along the Arctic coast 
of Alaska has carried many tons of food supplies, packages of clothing, 
and household goods, purchased with the proceeds of the sale of furs 
and other commodities sent out by the natives during the previous 
summer. All transactions in connection with these sales, purchases, 
and shipments have hitherto been carried on under the general over- 
sight of the chief of the Alaska Division of the Bureau of Education, 
acting as a private individual. This philanthropic action, inaugu- 
rated as an emergency measure, has now received official sanction 
by the Department of the Interior and has been made part of the 
official duties of the chief of the Alaska Division, who is under bond 
for the faithful performance of the same. 
During the summer of 1913 the natives of Tatitlek, under the 
instruction and supervision of the teacher, conducted a successful 
experiment in salting and exporting salmon bellies. The Bureau of 
Education provided the fishing equipment, including a drag seine 
and two gill nets, and a wholesale dealer in salt fish in Seattle fur- 
nished the salt and barrels and guaranteed the natives stipulated 
prices for the various species of salmon. This industry was continued 
during 1914, and 165 barrels of salted salmon bellies were exported 
during the season. 
The waters of Alaska teem with fish, and throughout its vast area 
wild berries grow in profusion. In the native villages, according to 
the ancient practice, the fish for winter use are either dried in the 
sun, crudely smoked, or buried in the earth, while the berries are 
preserved in oil. In order to replace these primitive methods, during 
the summer of 1914 steam-pressure home-canning outfits for use in 
preserving fish and meat, as well as berries and vegetables, were 
sent to Mountain Village, on the Yukon River, and to Klukwan and 
Metlakahtla, in southeastern Alaska. It is hoped that many natives 
will buy such outfits; their general use can not fail to have a bene- 
ficial effect upon the health of the native communities. 
The Bureau of Education fosters the establishment of cooperative 
enterprises owned and managed by the natives themselves. That 
the natives can, under proper supervision, successfully conduct 
their own enterprises has been demonstrated at Hydaburg, Klawock,  
-P-A-G-E-673
  EDUCATION OF NATIVES OF ALASKA, 637 
Atka, and St. Lawrence Island, where cooperative stores have been 
in operation for some years. In their own cooperative stores the 
natives secure articles of food, clothing, and furniture at equitable 
prices, and the shareholders divide among themselves the profits 
which would otherwise go to a middleman. 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
The imperative necessity for adequate and special provision by 
congressional appropriation for the medical relief of the Eskimos, 
Indians, Aleuts, and other natives of Alaska can not be too strongly 
urged. Year after year this matter has been brought to the attention 
of Congress, without success. As an emergency measure, dictated 
by the absolute necessity for action, part of the education appropria- 
tion continues to be used for the checking of disease in the native 
communities. Three school buildings have been remodeled for use as 
improvised hospitals, a few physicians and nurses have been employed, 
and the teachers have been supplied with simple remedies to enable 
them to treat minor ailments. This makeshift arrangement should 
be replaced by an adequate medical service such as has been repeatedly 
recommended by the Bureau of Education in the estimates submitted 
to Congress. 
One of the greatest difficulties with which those responsible for the 
work of the Bureau of Education have to contend is the fact that the 
congressional appropriation for the support of this work is usually 
not available until the end of August. With the exception of its 
southern coast, all of Alaska is icebound for eight months of the year. 
It is only during July, August, and September that supplies can be 
delivered at places in the interior of Alaska and on the shores of 
Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. In order to insure delivery before 
those regions are again closed by ice, supplies should leave Seattle 
not later than June 1 of each year. It is therefore recommended that 
the estimates for the support of the work of the Bureau of Education 
in Alaska be taken out of the sundry civil bill and included in the 
urgent deficiency bill. 
It is recommended that the appropriations for the support of the 
Alaska school service and of the Alaska reindeer service be made 
reimbursable, as is the case with regard to several of the appropria- 
tions for the support of the Indian Service in the States. Some of 
the school gardens produce vegetables in excess of immediate needs. 
It is probable that the surplus product of these gardens, also the 
baskets and other native work done in connection with the school 
service, could be made productive of considerable income. By the 
sale of meat and hides the reindeer service could probably be made 
self-supporting.  
-P-A-G-E-674
  638 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
THE REINDEER SERVICE. 
The reports from the reindeer stations for the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 1914, show a total of 57,872 reindeer distributed among 65 
herds. Of the 57,872 reindeer, 37,828, or 66 per cent, were owned 
by 980 natives; 4,113, or 7 per cent, were owned by the United 
States; 5,924, or 10 per cent, were owned by missions; and 10,007, 
or 17 per cent, were owned by Lapps. The total income of the 
natives from the reindeer industry during the fiscal year, exclusive of 
the meat and hides used by the natives themselves, was $77,934. The 
total, 57,872, is a net inerease of 22 per cent during the fiscal year, 
notwithstanding the fact that nearly 6,000 reindeer were killed for 
meat and skins during the year. 
No deterioration in the herds on account of inbreeding has been 
noted. On the contrary, the chief of the Alaska Division maintains 
that the reindeer now in Alaska are larger animals than those which 
comprised the original stock imported from Siberia, that Alaska 
affords a better range than Siberia, and that the climate is better 
adapted to the reindeer industry. The herds in Alaska average more 
than 700 reindeer each, so that the danger of inbreeding can not be 
serious. The introduction of wild caribou into some of the herds has 
increased the size of the reindeer in those herds. 
The greatest menace to the reindeer industry are the fires, usually 
started in the neighborhood of mining camps, which sometimes cause 
the wanton destruction of vast stretches of valuable grazing lands. 
The reindeer industry is now extending from the mainland to the 
outlying islands. During August, 1914, upon the request of the De- 
partment of the Interior, the Revenue cutter Manning conveyed a 
herd of 40 reindeer from Ugashik, on the Alaska Peninsula, to Atka, 
aremote island in the Aleutian chain, where it will be a valuable factor 
in alleviating the deplorable conditions which have hitherto prevailed 
upon that desolate island. The extension of the reindeer industry 
into southeast Alaska was begun by the shipment to Metlakahtla, on 
Annette Island, of 8 reindeer from the herd in the vicinity of Nome. 
The Bureau of Education is distributing the reindeer as rapidly as 
the natives can be trained to individual ownership, the policy being to 
encourage independence and initiative among the native population. 
The distribution of reindeer is in charge of the United States school- 
teachers, and it is expected that the Government will distribute all its 
reindeer within the next four years. 
In August, 1911, 40 reindeer were delivered to the Department 
of Commerce for use in stocking St. Paul and St. George Islands; in 
June, 1914, the number of reindeer on those islands had increased 
to 133, of which 75 were on St. Paul and 58 on St. George. 
By Executive order the Aleutian Islands have been set aside as a 
reservation under the Department of Agriculture and the Depart-
-P-A-G-E-675
THE SCHOOLS OF HAWAIL. 639 
ment of Commerce for the conservation of fish and fur-bearing ani- 
mals, and for the raising of reindeer. In compliance with the request 
of the Department of Agriculture, 55 reindeer were delivered to that 
department during September, 1913, from one of the herds of the De- 
partment of the Interior on the Alaska Peninsula, of which 19 were 
landed on Amaknak Island and 36 on Umnak Island, of the Aleutian 
chain. 
Hitherto no special endeavor has been made to foster the exporta- 
tion of reindeer meat from Alaska, in view of the fact that most of the 
reindeer butchered have been required to supply the local markets in 
Alaska. It appears that such exportation is now desirable. The last 
steamer to leave Nome before the close of navigation by ice brought to 
Seattle 25 carcasses of reindeer. These were placed on sale in Seat- 
tle, retailing at from 20 to 35 cents per pound. The chief of the 
Alaska Division also brought from Nome 3 carcasses to be distribu- 
ted among the five transcontinental railway lines running out of 
Seattle, in order that reindeer meat might be given a trial on the din- 
ing cars, with a view to securing for the natives contracts for the de- 
livery of reindeer meat each season. 
Soon after the inception of the reindeer enterprise certain Lapps 
were brought from Lapland to Alaska and employed by the Bureau: of 
Education as instructors of the Eskimos in the care and management 
of the reindeer, each Lapp receiving a certain number of reindeer in 
payment for his services. During the summer of 1914 a company, 
organized at Nome, purchased about 1,200 reindeer from one of these 
Lapps. This company intends to purchase other herds now owned 
by Lapps, and to engage in the exportation of reindeer meat on a large 
scale. 
THE SCHOOLS OF HAWAII. 
The unusual racial situation that complicates the task of educa- 
tion in Hawaii may be seen.from the following: There are in the 
Territory 6,377 native Hawaiians in the public schools and 1,737 in 
the private schools. The Japanese in the public schools number 
10,329, with 1,179 in the private schools; while the Chinese have 
2,638 in the public and 974 in the private schools. Of Portuguese 
the public schools have 4,329, and the private schools 1,071. The 
public schools have also 920 Spanish pupils and 717 Porto Ricans. 
There are only 635 American pupils in the public schools, but there 
are 768 in the private schools. There are of British, Germans, 
Russians, and Filipinos in the public schools about an equal number, 
not over 200 of each nationality. 
The total of 33,288 pupils of various nationalities, distributed out 
of all proportion among the native population, presents, therefore, a 
problem for the Hawaiian public schools not equaled by another 
section under the jurisdiction of the United States.  
-P-A-G-E-676

640 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
In the 168 public schools in the Territory there are 571 female and 
142 male teachers. Of the 26,990 pupils enrolled in the public 
schools, the average attendance reaches 25,019. The island of Oahu, 
which has the largest number of pupils, 10,659, has a record of 
10,576 as the average attendance. 
The total number of pupils in all Hawaiian schools for the year 
amounts to 33,288, an increase of only 350 as compared with an 
increase of 3,029 last year. The public-school pupils, who number 
this year 26,990, increased 1,359 over last year; while the private- 
school pupils, now numbering only 6,298, show a loss of 1,009 in 
comparison with last year. 
The Japanese still furnish the largest number of pupils, totaling 
11,508 for the year; but the increase is but 518 as against 1,692 last 
year. The Portuguese pupils come next in representation with 5,400 
in all schools, but this is 97 less than reported a year ago. On the 
other hand the part-Hawaiians, who numbered less than the Hawaiians 
in previous reports, this year take the third place, outnumbering the 
latter by 216. The percentage of part-Hawaiian pupils in the Terri- 
tory for 1914 is 12.51 of the total enrollment in all schools. 
As to teachers in both the public and private schools of the Terri- 
tory, by far the largest number of any nationality are Americans. 
There are 290 of these in the public and 221 in the private schools of 
the islands. There are 176 part-Hawaiian public-school teachers. 
: There are also 68 Portuguese and 30 Chinese. The total public- 
school teaching force is 713.

In his report for 1913-14, Gov. W. F. Frear declares: 
The Territory of Hawaii has been distinctly and generously a supporter of education 
in practical forms and also of what may be termed advanced theories of pedagogical 
and ethical types, and the tendency has been to magnify these latter. A point has 
been reached where there must be a reaction in favor of sound, rational education, 
if the Territory of Hawaii is to find support in the vocations it has to offer its children 
after such preparation. The department of public instruction has been directed to 
use all its wisdom and effort to bring about sound, not theoretical, education, and it 
is making the effort.

Canal Zone during the year 1913-14. The present requirements 
for appointments to positions are as follows: 
No applicant will be considered who is not an American citizen; who is more than 
45 years of age; who has not completed a regular four-year high-school or academy 
course; who has not had two years’ training in a standard normal school or college; 
and two years’ successful experience, certified to by at least three persons engaged in 
educational work and having personal knowledge of the applicant and her work as a 
teacher. High-school teachers must have four years’ college or university training, 
in place of the two years’ college or normal training required for grade teachers. 
Medical inspection of schools was continued during the year. 
The record of inspection of white pupils with respect to eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, and teeth shows that out of a total of 894 children 
examined, 352, or 39.4 per cent, were found defective, and 39 were 
treated. 
On May 22 the chief health officer issued the following instructions 
to district physicians regarding medical inspection of schools: 
Hereafter please make an inspection, at least once each month, of all the public 
schools in your district and report thereon, in writing, to this office on the last day of 
the month. 
The inspection of the school building should be with reference to its sanitary con- 
dition, and should cover cleanliness of water-closets, lavatories, receptacles for holding 
drinking water, the question of individual drinking cups, overcrowding, condition of 
playgrounds, and anything else that may be of interest. 
The inspection of the pupils should not interfere with their work and should be 
made with particular reference to the presence of contagious diseases, etc. 
Any insanitary condition should be brought at once to the attention of the principal 
of the school, and if not corrected it should be taken up with this office. 
Copies of this circular were furnished to all teachers. 
At the request of the chief health officer, and in order to enable the 
district physicians to keep a check on the fever cases in their respec- 
tive districts, the following direction was issued to all teachers on 
June 5: 
No pupil absent from school on account of sickness shall be readmitted to school 
without a certificate from the district physician. 
During the year a public schools athletic league was formed in the 
white schools, with the cooperation of the Y. M. C. A. clubhouse 
officials. The first annual meet of the league was held on Friday 
evening, June 12, in the clubhouses at Balboa, Corozal, Empire, 
Gatun, and Cristobal. The meet was won by the Corozal school. 
There were 198 participants, 99 boys and 99 girls. Each participant 
was given a certificate signed by the superintendent of clubhouses, 
the president and the secretary of the league, and the superintendent 
of schools. 
The Canal Zone high school, as organized at the close of the year, 
consisted of the main high school at Ancon and the branch high school 
for first and second year pupils at Gatun.

EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 
GENERAL STATEMENT. 
Briefly stated, the problem which the government of the Philip- 
pines must face is, first, to give the great mass of the population a 
primary education; second, to give an intermediate education to 
those who will constitute the substantial middle class of the country; 
and third, to provide secondary and higher instruction for those who 
are to assume leadership in thought and action. 
It is the aim to give the great mass of the population elementary 
instruction in reading and writing; in sufficient arithmetic for simple 
business transactions; in home and world geography; in the simple 
rules of sanitation; in good manners and right conduct; in physical 
training to a point where they can bear effectively the increasing 
burden which civilization lays upon mankind; in notions of the rights 
and duties of citizens; and in a certain amount of industrial work to 
promote industry and general efficiency. 
There is at present in the Philippines a genuine enthusiasm for 
education. This is largely a product of the work of the last 13 years. 
In the early days there was, of course, a small class of people who 
realized the benefits of education and were anxious to have their 
children avail themselves of all educational opportunities, but the 
general desire for education among the masses did not exist. Nat- 
urally all, including those who realized the benefits of an education, 
were more or less suspicious of a system which violated so many of 
their preconceived notions. In many sections of the country the   
 
-P-A-G-E-680
  644 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
‘upper class kept their children away until the schools had proved 
their value. As soon as a considerable number of pupils passed from 
the primary into the intermediate and then into the secondary grades, 
however, the people saw evidence of progress, and schools gradually 
became popular with this more influential element. 
One of the greatest factors in popularizing the public schools was 
the introduction of athletic sports. Athletics has served not only 
to increase the regularity of attendance, but also to reduce the amount 
of tardiness, which at the beginning was appalling. 
The feeling that earlier operated against the public schools later 
operated in their favor; the movement for independence a few years 
ago gave the people the impression that time spent in the public 
schools was wasted, since independence would bring an entire change 
in the conduct of affairs. In later years there has been a feeling that 
the granting of independence is contingent upon education, and that 
the public schools offer the sure way of achieving this end. This is 
reflected in the attitude of a considerable number of men who prefer 
to send their own children to private schools, but who nevertheless 
support the public schools to the best of their ability. 
ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE. 
The allotment made by the Hon. W. Cameron Forbes, while gov- 
ernor general of the Philippines, of the sum of $75,000 for the estab- 
lishment and maintenance of 1,000 additional primary schools and 
the passage of Act No. 2288, appropriating the sum of $87,500 to 
complete the sum of $162,500 necessary for the maintenance of these 
schools, made it possible to increase the attendance in the public 
schools during the current year by more than 100,000. 
For September, 1914, the monthly enrollment was 525,959. Of 
this total monthly enrollment, 486,511 were in the primary grades, 
33,579 in the intermediate grades, and 5,869 in the secondary grades. 
Of this monthly enrollment, 23,695 boys and 9,820 girls were enrolled 
in the last year of the primary course; 6,020 boys and 1,580 girls 
were enrolled in the last year of the intermediate course; and 465 
boys and 77 girls were studying in the last year of the secondary 
course. The number of schools has been increased from 2,934 in 
the month of March, 1913, to 4,304 for the month of September, 1913, 
an increase of 1,370. 
INDUSTRIAL INSTRUCTION. 
The industrial instruction started by the Philippine bureau of 
education almost from its beginning, and systematized four years ago, 
has become a powerful element in the development of the country. 
It is believed that this instruction will increase the industrial efficiency 
of the people and create an educated class in sympathetic touch with
-P-A-G-E-681
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 645 
labor and the development of the country. To appreciate the 
present-day attitude of the educated class and to realize how much 
progress has been made in the last 13 years, it is only necessary to 
recall the early days, when a clerk would feel insulted if asked to carry 
a book or close a window; when a large part of the pupils came to 
school with servants carrying books and umbrellas; and when Ameri- 
can teachers were told by prominent Filipinos that the carrying of a 
box or suitcase would lead to loss of social prestige. 
The Philippine bureau of education has made special effort to 
standardize the various lines of handicraft work, and to this end has 
sent to the field a series of about 130 designs containing illustrations 
and explicit working directions for the making of such articles. The 
success in discovering new industrial materials and in extending the 
application of those formerly known has gone on apace. 
The results achieved thus far have been the inauguration of an 
industrial system and its acceptance by the people and teachers; the 
working out of industrial courses adapted to the needs of the people 
and to the utilizing of materials indigenous to the country; a better 
appreciation of the character and extent of local industries; the 
gathering of a mass of material dealing with the situation, and its 
issuance to the field in the form of texts, bulletins, and The Philippine 
Craftsman. The commercial side of the situation has been kept in 
view from the beginning, though the purpose is not, nor has it been, 
to exploit in any way the productive capacity of pupils. The pur- 
pose is rather to train them to become useful citizens and at the same 
time to develop in them a keener realization of the industrial needs 
and possibilities of their country. This program will be continued 
with special reference to specializing in the further use of materials 
and designs distinctive of the Philippines. 
Agricultural education has been extended into the intermediate 
grades by means of a special type of intermediate school. Practical 
agricultural education, including the study of agricultural texts in 
connection with daily field work, and of academic subjects, is given 
in the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades. In connection with this course 
in farming, there is offered, where practicable, a special course for 
girls in housekeeping and household arts. 
These farm schools are concerned with developing model 10-hectare 
farms. At present eight such schools are being conducted, at the 
following places: 
Batac Farm School, Batac, Locos Norte. 
Ballesteros Farm School, Ballesteros, Cagayan. 
San Carlos Farm School, San Carlos, Pangasinan. 
Batangas Farm School, Batangas, Batangas. 
Iba Farm School, Iba, Zambales. 
Guinobatan Farm School, Guinobatan, Albay. 
Indang Farm School, Indang, Cavite.   
 
-P-A-G-E-682
  
  646 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Reports show an enrollment of 1,339 pupils in these schools. It is 
expected that the extension work will continue as rapidly as the nec- 
essary financial assistance can be secured until there is at least one 
farm school in each province. 
THE CORN CAMPAIGN. 
During the school year 1912-13 the Philippine bureau of education 
conducted a corn campaign which directly aimed to encourage the 
people in the growing of corn, by teaching them how to use it, and 
especially by furnishing them recipes for the many good, wholesome 
things which can be made economically from it. Over 43,500 boys 
are enrolled in the present campaign. 
A corn display was made in Manila at the 1913 carnival as a part 
of the bureau of education exhibit. The prize-winning ears of corn 
in each provincial contest were submitted, and from these the insular 
winners were chosen. This was the first corn exhibit held in the 
Orient. Besides the display of corn, various dishes made from corn 
were served; hand corn mills and other improved machinery were 
shown, and posters and placards giving facts relating to the work were 
in evidence. 
TEACHERS. 
When American teachers were first employed for the Philippine 
service, the idea of the authorities seemed to be that they would be 
teachers of English in schools taught and managed by Filipinos. The 
American teacher was to have a classroom to which pupils would 
come at stated periods for instruction in English. It was found, 
however, that there was no adequate supply of native teachers quali- 
fied to handle instruction either in English or Spanish, and as a result 
American teachers were compelled to assume charge of the school and 
begin the instruction of young Filipino men and women ambitious to 
become teachers. As soon as a small number of these teachers was 
developed they were sent out to teach, and the supervising system 
was gradually evolved. At first all supervising teachers were Ameri- 
cans, but gradually the best-qualified Filipinos were assigned as super- 
vising teachers, and the number has been constantly increased. 
It has been the policy of the Philippine bureau of education to lay 
an increasing amount of responsibility upon the Filipino teacher. 
As a result, where five years ago there were 70 Filipino and 390 
American supervising teachers, there are tq-day 124 Filipino super- 
vising teachers and 185 American. Moreover, there are a number of 
Filipinos assigned to work which is at least equal in importance and 
responsibility to that of the supervising teachers. There are now 29 
Filipino provincial industrial supervisors, and this number will be 
constantly increased. There are at present 120 intermediate schools
-P-A-G-E-683
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 647 
with Filipino principals. Five years ago there were 208 Filipino and 
866 American teachers engaged in intermediate instruction; at the 
present time there are 430 Filipinos and 148 Americans. Primary 
instruction, except in a very few classes where special work is carried 
on, is entirely in the hands of Filipinos. 
INSULAR SCHOOLS. 
The School of Household Industries—The establishment of the 
School of Household Industries was made possible by an appro- 
priation of $50,000 under the provisions of Act 2110. The purpose 
of this school is to train adult women in lace making and embroidery, 
with a view to their returning to their respective towns to form 
industrial centers for carrying out these industries. The course of 
study covers a period of eight months, and to date 250 have been 
graduated from the school. 
The Philippine School of Arts and Trades.—Work on the plans for 
the new building for the Philippine School of Arts and Trades is 
nearing completion. Until the buildings are ready for occupancy, 
little expansion can be made in the work of this school. It is impos- 
sible at present to accommodate the applicants for admission. 
During one month the attendance was over 600. 
The Philippine School of Commerce.—The work of the Philippine 
School of Commerce continues to progress satisfactorily. During 
the month of December 308 pupils were in attendance. In the 
commercial night school conducted for the accommodation of young 
men and women who are employed during the day there were 
enrolled for the month of December 249 pupils. For administrative 
purposes this school is under the direction of the superintendent of 
city schools. It is supported from insular funds. 
The Oentral Luzon Agricultural School—The Central Luzon 
Agricultural School, an insular school located at Munoz, Nueva Ecija, 
has made very marked progress during the last six months. On 
a reservation comprising 657 hectares has been built up an institu- 
tion which promises to become the model for future work. It is 
not only a school, but an industrial community, where every oppor- 
tunity is given to the pupils to participate in the practical problems 
of everyday life. Field and garden crops are grown, buildings, 
roads, irrigation and drainage systems are constructed, and the 
affairs of the school are so arranged as to approximate conditions 
which will be encountered when the pupils take up their life work 
as citizens of the country. 
The Nautical School.—The oldest educational institution to come 
under the supervision of the Philippine bureau of education was the 
Philippine Nautical School, which was first established in Manila 
in 1839. It was continued under the American régime until 1907.  
-P-A-G-E-684
    648 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The school was finally closed owing to dissatisfaction arising from 
its indefinite status and the uncertainty of appropriations for its 
support. Since the closing of this school there has been from time 
to time a demand for its reestablishment. Accordingly, on the 
recommendation of the shipowners’ association, the secretary of 
public instruction instructed the director of education, in the latter 
part of 1912, to open a nautical class in connection with the Philip- 
pine School of Arts and Trades. 
OTHER EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 
The public schools as a civic factor.—Public schools have made a 
notable contribution to the body politic of the islands. Probably 
of the 240,000 voters of the present time not more than 99,000 are 
qualified as electors because of education. Of this number there is 
a considerable percentage that claims an education in English as 
meeting the requirements. During the school year 1912-13 the 
primary course was completed by 10,938 boys and 4,102 girls. As 
soon as these boys are of age, they should be qualified as voters, 
and this number is bound to increase very rapidly from year to year. 
Ciwico-educational lectures.—Act 1829 provided that the director 
of education should make arrangements to have municipal teachers 
throughout the islands deliver annual series of civico-educational 
lectures. Accordingly, lectures have been given on the rights and 
duties of citizens, the prevention of diseases, rice, coconuts, corn, 
the housing of the public schools, and coconut beetles. Generally 
these lectures are given in connection with some musical or literary 
entertainment, which serves to attract the people of the community. 
In addition to the lectures by teachers, lectures are often delivered 
on subjects of interest by leading citizens of the community. During 
the school year 1912-13 it is estimated that a half million people 
heard one or more of these lectures. 
The Philippine Bureau of Education as a publicity medium.—It 
was early recognized by the authorities of the government that the 
bureau of education was in a position to circulate useful information 
among the people on any subject of importance. The Philippine 
bureau of education, as an agent for the bureau of lands, has dis- 
seminated information relative to the homestead laws. It has 
assisted the bureau of posts in familiarizing the people generally 
with the organization and benefits of the postal savings bank. It 
has assisted the bureau of public works in teaching the value and 
importance of good roads, and at various times, acting under the 
direction of superior authority, it has taught in the public schools 
facts that should be generally known to the people of the country. 
The disposition of the Filipino people to give attention to the lessons 
learned by their children in school has made it comparatively easy 
for the bureau of education to do the work successfully.
-P-A-G-E-685
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 649 
The athletic program of the bureau of education.—The athletic 
program of the bureau of education has been most effective. Atten- 
tion has been given not only to specialized forms of athletics, in 
which only a small percentage can take part to advantage, but also 
to a system of group games in which every normal boy and girl can 
without difficulty take part. It is believed that at the present 
time fully. 80 per cent of all the pupils enrolled are receiving instruc- 
tion in athletics and physical training in one way or another. The 
influence of this campaign has extended far beyond the public 
schools, and one rarely finds a back lot not filled with children 
playing games which they have learned directly or indirectly from 
the public schools. Filipinos have become generally devoted to 
wholesome sport. There is a noticeable physical development on 
every hand, and the moral influence of clean, healthy sports is to 
be seen everywhere. The rank and file of the people follow these 
sports with the greatest interest and enthusiasm, and this desire 
to excel in play is extending itself day by day to other local interests. 
Village improvement societies and instruction in civics.—The 
Philippine bureau of education has since its organization given 
particular attention to instruction in the rights and duties of citi- 
zens of the Philippine Islands. A fairly satisfactory text has been 
secured for use in the intermediate grades, and outlines have been 
prepared covering the work in civics in the primary grades. At the 
beginning of the school year 1913-14 a very definite outline on this 
subject was issued for distribution to all the schools of the islands, 
The organization of village improvement societies in the various 
schools has been encouraged for a number of years. These societies 
discuss many questions of local interest, including roads, sanitation, 
drainage, public buildings, etc. 
THE EXTENT OF ENGLISH SPEECH IN THE PHILIPPINES. 
It is difficult to estimate with any degree of exactness the amount 
of English spoken in the Philippines. It is safe to say, however, 
that the knowledge of English is far more general than the knowl- 
edge of Spanish. 
Reference to the reports of the director of. civil service shows 
that 7,755 applicants took examinations in English and 954 in 
Spanish during the fiscal year ending July 1, 1913. Of those taking 
the examinations in English 23 per cent passed, and of those taking 
the examination in Spanish 19 per cent qualified. Five years ago 
the number taking the examination in English was 4,223, and in 
Spanish 1,975, while in the year ending July 1, 1904, 2,443 were 
examined in English and 3,011 in Spanish. The Spanish applicants 
are in most cases men either educated in private schools or educated 
prior to the American occupation, whereas those examined in English 
are almost entirely the product of the public schools.

    650 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS, ACQUISITION OF SITES, ETC. 
The authorities of the Philippine bureau of education were com- 
pelled to give early attention to the question of housing public 
schools.. The schools inherited from the Spanish régime a number 
of old school buildings of medieval type. 
A few special plans were made and school buildings constructed, 
but progress was not satisfactory until 1909, when Act No. 1914 
was passed. This act provided that the preparation and approval 
of plans for buildings to be constructed under the terms of the 
Gabaldon Act should be under the direction of the secretary of 
public instruction. The secretary of public instruction immediately 
authorized the formation of a buildings division in the bureau of 
education and the preparation of plans for buildings which could 
be constructed with the limited funds at the command of the govern- 
ment. With the advice and assistance of the consulting architect 
this division prepared plans for standard one-story school buildings 
of reinforced concrete, with iron roofs, and timber of satisfactory 
grade. A series of plans were made providing for buildings of 
from 1 to 20 rooms. These plans were so framed that the construc- 
tion of additional rooms is possible without destroying the symmetry 
of the building. During 1910 these plans were perfected, and 
arrangements were made for the construction of a large number 
of buildings. 
Since that time the progress in construction of permanent build- 
ings has been very encouraging. There has been a demand from 
every quarter for insular assistance, and the number of buildings 
has been limited only by the amount of money at the disposition of 
this bureau. 
Since the passage of the Gabaldon Act in 1907, permanent concrete 
school buildings to the number of 306 have been erected, containing 
780 rooms; 26 were constructed during the six months ending 
December 31, 1913. There are at present in possession of the 
various branches of the government 618 permanent school buildings, 
representing 3,252 rooms. 
There are now in possession of the Philippine bureau of education, 
all in usable condition, 26 trade school and manual training buildings 
of permanent type, 22 provincial high schools, and 3 dormitories 
“for girls. 
TEXTBOOKS AND PUBLICATIONS. 
When the schools were opened after the American occupation of 
the Philippines the English textbooks which were particularly 
adapted to school work in the United States were found unsuitable 
for use in this country. It was therefore necessary to give early 
attention to the preparation of textbooks adapted to use in the 
Philippines.
-P-A-G-E-687
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 651 
At the present time all of the books used in the primary and 
intermediate grades, with the exception of music books and supple- 
mentary readers, have been prepared expressly for use in Philippine 
schools. In the high schools some of the texts have been prepared 
particularly for Philippine use. 
The Philippine Craftsman, an industrial magazine published by 
the bureau of education, has had a very favorable reception. The 
first number appeared in July, 1912, and the magazine is now in the 
second volume. Its place in the public-school system is important. 
Through this medium is communicated to the field industrial notes 
and methods which it would be difficult to distribute to the entire 
field promptly without preparing special bulletins or texts. 
The various publications of the bureau of education have received 
very favorable mention not only from educators in the United 
States, but from other parts of the world, particularly the oriental 
countries and dependencies, where conditions are similar to those 
found in the Philippines. It is therefore probable that the effects of 
the school work in the Philippines will later be reflected somewhat in 
the system evolved in surrounding countries. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK AMONG THE NONCHRISTIAN PEOPLES. 
The appropriations of the Philippine Commission have made 
possible the prosecution of school work among the peoples living 
within the so-called non-Christian Provinces of the Mountain 
Province, Nueva Vizcaya, and Agusan. Living outside the so- 
called non-Christian Provinces is a considerable number of non- 
Christians, among some of whom educational work has been done. 
School work among the non-Christians living in Christian Provinces 
is carried on by means of direct’ allotments from the appropriation of 
the bureau of education and with such assistance as the Provinces 
may give from the non-Christian inhabitant fund at their disposition. 
Educational work among the Tinguianes has been most successful 
from the start. The best known of the schools for these people is 
located at Lagangilang, Ilocos Sur, and the instruction is largely in- 
dustrial in nature. Several attempts have been made to extend the 
public-school system to the Negritos. The results have not usually 
justified the expenditure.

    FRANK RUSSELL WHITE. 
By the death of Director Frank Russell White on August 17, 1913, 
the Philippine bureau of education particularly, and the Philippine 
government in general, suffered an irreparable loss. 
Mr. White was one of the pioneers in the educational work of the 
Philippines. He was appointed a teacher on May 15, 1901, and 
arrived in Manila on the transport Sheridan on June 22, 1901. On 
October 1 of the same year he was promoted to the position of deputy 
superintendent of the Province of Tarlac, and on November 1, 1902, 
was made division superintendent of schools for Tarlac. He remained 
in this position until February 5, 1903, when he was transferred to 
the division superintendency of the Province of Antique. Before he 
took over the work of that division, however, he was brought into the 
general office of the bureau (Mar. 7, 1903) and appointed assistant to 
the general superintendent of education. On October 26, 1905, he 
became the second assistant director of education, and was appointed 
to direct the school work of the Philippines as director of education 
on December 1, 1909. 
The record of the last 12 years of Mr. White’s life forms an interest- 
ing and important chapter in the annals of the bureau of education 
and its work. To his conscientious efforts may be largely attributed 
the phenomenal growth and high efficiency of the school system of 
the Philippines. Few men associated with this Government have 
reflected greater credit upon their country.

CHAPTER XXIX. 
EDUCATION IN CANADA! 
By Anna Toitman Smita, 
Specialist in Foreign Educational Systems. 
ConTENTS.—General activity—Salient particulars in the record of individual Provinces: Ontario, Quebec, 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, the western Provinces—The bilingual question— 
Appropriation for agricultural education—Summarized statistics. 
GENERAL ACTIVITY. 
The current record of education in the Canadian Provinces shows a 
continuance of general efforts for the increase and improvement of 
elementary schools, and the rise of new activities. The latter have 
been stimulated by an appropriation of $10,000,000 from the consol- 
idated revenue fund of Canada, to be paid out during the period of 
10 years beginning with the year ending March 31, 1914. This fund 
is to aid farming industry by instruction in agriculture, including 
work to be carried on by veterinary colleges. 
The report of the royal commission on industrial training and tech- 
nical education, appointed in 1910, was not completed until the cur- 
rent year; the recommendations called for an annual appropriation 
of $3,000,000 for a period of 10 years to be paid into a Dominion devel- 
opment fund; 75 per cent of this is to go to the Provinces direct, on 
a per capita basis and the remaining 25 per cent to be retained for 
expenses through a central Dominion board. The fund is intended 
to aid all phases of industrial work, including agriculture, manufac- 
turing, household science, etc. The commission advised also that 
a fund not less than $350,000 a year should be created for the encour- 
agement of— 
handiwork, drawing, domestic science, etc., in elementary schools in the different 
Provinces. This large scheme, which was carefully worked out in detail by the com- 
mission, has been under advisement during the year.” 
  
1 Asin previous years, the chapters in this report dealing with education in foreign countries have been 
prepared under the general direction of the specialist in foreign educational systems from official reports 
and correspondence, and with the assistance of various collaborators, who are specified in connection with 
their several contributions. 
‘The Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1913 brought the survey of education in foreign coun- 
tries to the close of that year. On account of the European war, educational measures that were pend- 
ing at the close of 1913, and plans formulated at the opening of the current year, have been deferred or sus- 
pended, and the interchange of information from official and private sources seriously interrupted. In 
respect therefore to the great nations involved in the conflict, the present survey covers only the seven 
months from January to August 1, 1914. In a measure, also, this is true of all other nations affected by 
this untoward event. The same cause has interfered with the usual course of events in the far eastern 
nations, but on account of their distance information obtained from them seldom relates to the current 
year.

  656 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Current discussions and experiments with regard to elementary 
education are indicated in the main by the recommendations of the 
royal commission cited above. The provincial authorities are already 
making provision for the new subjects, but there is need of larger 
resources to give the general equipment and the teachers required 
by the extension. Everywhere the provision of schools keeps pace 
with the demand. This work absorbs the chief energies of the newer 
Provinces of the west, all of which are lavish in their appropriations 
for securing sites, putting up schoolhouses, and securing teachers by 
the offer of salaries greater than those paid in more settled communi- 
ties. 
The extent of the educational provision is shown by tabulated sta- 
tistics at the end of this section. The following statements relate to 
salient features of the year’s record in the individual Provinces: 
SALIENT PARTICULARS IN THE RECORD OF INDIVIDUAL PROVINCES. 
Ontario.—The Province of Ontario has taken the lead in the pro- 
vision of continuation schools, and in connection with them the matter 
of vocational training has become urgent. In his recent report 
Mr. Mills, inspector of continuation schools, observes that they are now 
firmly established as a part of the educational system of Ontario, and 
that they take the young people at the very moment when it is 
desirable to give them vocational training. On this subject he says, 
“the public conscience is alive to the necessity for and the justice of 
this work.” In tracing the progress of the movement for vocational 
training, Mr. Mills observes that in cities and towns it has resulted 
in the introduction of manual training and domestic economy into 
the ordinary schools, to be followed later by technical schools and 
evening classes that give practical instruction to persons engaged 
during the day. With respect to the conditions favorable to this 
work in large centers of population, he says: 
Among business men and employees active and intelligent leadership may readily 
be found; the money necessary to provide the accommodation, equipment, and sala- 
ries is more easily obtained; the people to be served are within easy reach of the school; 
and the return to both employer and employee is more apparent in a better and cheaper 
article and in an increase in the daily wage. 
* * * * * * * 
The problem becomes more difficult, and up to the present time very little has been 
done toward reaching the young men and women with any course in agriculture or 
domestic economy. No matter where one goes in Canada or the Northern States much 
is heard of what is being done toward introducing agriculture, manual training, and 
domestic science into the rural public schools, but when these methods are examined 
they are found to have little promise and to depend on the individuality of some 
enthusiastic teacher. So far as the teaching of agriculture in the rural schools is con- 
cerned, it can, in my opinion, never hope to accomplish more than has been accom- 
plished by the courses in manual training and domestic science established some 
years ago in the public schools of large urban centers. However, as these manual
-P-A-G-E-693
EDUCATION IN CANADA, 657 
training and domestic science classes in urban centers were the forerunners of, and pre- 
pared the way for, the present technical schools and evening industrial classes, so the 
present agricultural work that is being done in the rural schools may be, and no doubt 
is, preparing the way for schools that will reach the corresponding class of young men 
and women in rural and small urban districts, and provide for them courses in agri- 
culture and household science that will better prepare them for the work of the farm 
and the home. 
In discussing possible plans Mr. Mills refers to the example of 
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, and other States of the United States, 
and the plan of traveling teachers adopted in Ireland, but he concludes 
that for Ontario it would be best to— 
establish schools in one or more centers in each township for the express purpose of 
giving the young men and women instruction in agriculture and household science, 
and seek to make these schools centers of social life; such schools to be regarded as 
part of the public school system. 
Quebec.—In a survey of movements in the Province of Quebec 
it is important to keep in mind the dual character of the public- 
school system. It is organized in two divisions—one comprising the 
Roman Catholic schools, the other the Protestant schools. The two 
divisions are under the general supervision of a common superin- 
tendent, but their affairs are directed by separate committees of the 
council of public instruction, styled, respectively, the Catholic com- 
mittee and the Protestant committee. The majority of all schools, 
colleges, and universities—viz, 5,925, in a total of 6,856—belong to 
the Catholic division. 
The increase in the number of normal schools pertaining to the 
Catholic division, and their adaptations to present demands, are 
features of special interest in the current record of the Province. 
The opening of two new normal schools in 1913 leaves but one 
diocese wanting in such provision. In his latest report the superin- 
tendent of public instruction mentions the spacious normal school 
completed in Montreal, by the Sisters of the Congregation, at a cost 
to the Government of $225,000, and another built for the same order 
at St. Pascal, Kamouraska. The latter is a normal school of house- 
hold science. The oldest school of household science and agricul- 
ture in Canada—that of Roberval, Lake St. John—has also received 
the recommendation of the Catholic committee for its elevation to 
the rank of normal school of household science and agriculture. It 
possesses a well-cultivated farm and has achieved distinction as a 
center of practical education. 
The establishment of Macdonald College at St. Anne de Bellevue, 
near Montreal, has given to the Province of Quebec one of the most 
important centers for the professional education of teachers in the 
world. The college, which was founded, equipped, and endowed by 
Sir William C. Macdonald, is incorporated with McGill University.

Its purposes are twofold—the advancement of education by research 
and investigation, and the dissemination of knowledge, with par- 
ticular regard to both the needs of rural districts and the effective 
training of teachers, especially those who will work in the rural 
schools. The college property comprises 561 acres and has been 
divided into four main areas, viz: (1) The campus, with lawn, 
school garden, and recreation fields for men and women; (2) experi- 
mental grounds, with plats for illustration and research in grains, 
grasses, and other farm crops; (3) the small cultures farm, for horti- 
culture and poultry keeping; and (4) the live-stock farm, extending 
to 387 acres. The college is organized in three sections: The school 
of agriculture, the school of teachers, and the school of household 
science. All students of the school for teachers are required to sign 
a pledge to teach three years in the Province. 
During the year an important forward step has been taken in the 
enactment of legislation by which students in the schools of agricul- 
ture and household science may secure rural-school diplomas by tak- 
ing a brief course of professional training. 
The recent affiliation of several teaching orders with Laval Uni- 
versity assures for certain of their schools the service of teachers 
having a high order of academic training. Under this arrangement 
the members of the orders have a university diploma which is re- 
garded as a full equivalent for the provincial diploma, from which 
they are exempted. 
New Brunswick.—The superintendent of education for New Bruns- 
wick calls attention to the slight decrease in the number of candi- 
dates for admission to the normal school, and also to the fact that 
the number of men seeking to enter the teaching service is diminish- 
ing, and expresses the fear that the Provinces may very soon be 
suffering froma dearth of teachers. Among the causes assigned for 
these conditions are the increasing opportunities for young men in 
agricultural pursuits and for young women in business offices. At 
the same time there is a steady tendency on the part of the best 
teachers to go west, with the expectation of obtaining larger sala- 
ries. Several school boards have met the difficulty by substantial 
increases in the salaries of teachers. New Brunswick has been suc- 
cessful in exciting an interest in school gardening. Reports from 23 
districts in different counties show a flourishing condition of gardens 
in connection with their schools. 
Nova Scotia.—The Provincial Normal College of Nova Scotia, 
situated at Truro, has gained wide reputation under the direction 
of Principal Soloan, who has brought about important relations 
between the college and the Truro School of Domestic Science and 
the Provincial Agricultural College. The college, however, is in
-P-A-G-E-695
  EDUCATION IN CANADA. 659 
pressing need of enlarged accommodations for its students and also 
for the uses of the domestic science department. 
A rural science school is conducted during July and August by 
the united faculties of the agricultural and normal college. The 
attendance in the summer session of 1913 was 90, and at the close 
21 full diplomas and 55 certificates of partial preparation were issued. 
This means— 
that some 70 or more schools than heretofore will be making an effort to establish 
school and home gardening as a basis for studying nature phenomena and elementary 
agriculture and for interpreting and appreciating neglected aspects of rural life. 
Nova Scotia has a well-organized system of technical education 
under the general supervision of Mr. Frederic H. Sexton, who is 
the principal of the Technical College. This institution has an 
excellent laboratory for the benefit of students in mining engineer- 
ing and is contributing information of great practical value in the 
building of good roads in the Province. Five colleges are affiliated 
with it, a summer school of surveying is maintained, and local schools 
of coal mining and engineering and evening technical schools, con- 
ducted under the general supervision of the principal of the Tech- 
nical College, are reported from six centers. Classes for the training 
of young women in needlework, household economy, and home deco- 
ration are held in several of these centers. 
Prince Edward Island, the smallest of the maritime Provinces, has 
recently taken a forward step by a marked improvement in teachers’ 
salaries, which has inspired them with new hope and ambition. This 
spirit was reflected by a very large attendance in the teachers’ 
association. At the annual meeting of 1913, out of a total of 583 
teachers in the service, 398 were registered. Resolutions were passed 
thanking the Government for the increase in salaries and also for 
providing the summer school. The Acadian teachers of this Pro- 
vince have a separate association, which also had a very large attend- 
ance in the meeting of 1913. This association has exercised a great 
influence in promoting the correct use and pronunciation of the French 
language. 
Summer school of science.—The Atlantic Provinces of Canada have 
combined in the support of a summer school of science, which held its 
twenty-seventh annual session at Halifax, Nova Scotia, July 8 to 
29,1913. At this meeting 225 members were enrolled as follows: 
Nova Scotia, 133; New Brunswick, 78; P. E. Island, 6; Quebec, 2; 
United States, 6. During the session four hours each morning were 
devoted to class work under able specialists; the afternoons, devoted 
to laboratory and field work; the evenings were given over to lectures 
and entertainments. 
The students at this summer school are encouraged and stimulated 
by the large number of scholarships offered for competition through
-P-A-G-E-696
  660 s EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the liberality of public-spirited friends of the enterprise. During the 
present year 68 scholarships were available—two of $50 each, three 
of $25 each, twenty-four of $20 each; the remainder range in value 
from $5 to $15 each. The receipts of the school for the session 
amounted to $2,042, of which $200 was granted by the Government 
of Nova Scotia, $100 by New Brunswick, $50 by Prince Edward 
Island, and $300 from the Halifax school board. The enrollment 
fees amounted to $1,035. The president of the association for the 
current year is Mr. S. A. Starrat, of Roxbury, Mass. 
The Western Provinces of Canada, while presenting differences in 
natural resources that affect educational progress, are alike in their 
possession of productive lands and their consequent attraction for 
farmers. A continued stream of settlers pours into this section, the 
aggregate for the calendar year 1913 being 412,955, of whom nearly 
one-third were farmers or farm laborers and another third general 
laborers. While the rural population grows at a rapid rate, cities 
and towns develop with equal rapidity and become thriving centers 
of manufactures and trade; demands for the appliances of modern 
life, such as sanitary systems, good roads, good schools, rise faster 
than they can be met. Under such conditions school systems may 
reach high development in urban centers, while the provision of 
schools and teachers can not keep pace with the spreading rural 
population. The salient particulars in the current reports of educa- 
tion in the chief cities fairly indicate, therefore, the spirit of progress 
throughout the western Provinces. 
Vancouver, the largest city of British Columbia, has a population 
of 200,000, or more than one-third the entire population of the 
Province (502,000). During the last year the course of instruction 
in the high school was extended to include forge-work and tinsmith- 
work. The interest thus excited is indicated by the fact that a class 
of 32 boys who were unable to take the work in class time, on account 
of the pressure of preparation for the university matriculation examin- 
ation, voluntarily engaged in the shopwork after school hours. In 
three large night classes instruction in physical training was given 
to 130 day-school teachers. Of this number, 111 secured certificates 
of qualification as teachers of physical culture, under the terms of 
the Strathcona trust, at the examination by the militia department, 
25 graduating with honors. 
The service of medical school inspection employs one medical health 
officer, with an assistant and four nurses. 
The Legislature of British Columbia has set apart 2,000,000 acres 
of land as an endowment for a provincial university, a site for which 
has been chosen in Vancouver. The total expenditure on education 
for 1912-13 was $4,658,894; in 1911, $2,641,522.
-P-A-G-E-697
EDUCATION IN CANADA. 661 
Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, has a population of 136,035, 
or about 30 per cent of the entire population of the Province. This 
city has been noted for its ample educational provision, and during 
the past year extended its facilities by the establishment of two 
technical high schools comprising academic courses of instruction 
with industrial and technical branches. By the upward expansion 
of courses of instruction in three intermediate schools of the Province, 
the number of high schools has been increased to 13, and in addition 
there are six collegiate departments which prepare students for the 
university. 
The capital city is the site of the University of Manitoba, founded 
in 1877 and registering at present 500 students, and an agricultural 
college which has nearly 400 students. 
Alberta and Saskatchewan, both organized as independent Pro- 
vinces in 1905, have large excess of rural population, but cities are 
rapidly growing and are well provided with facilities for education. 
Municipal efforts have been expended chiefly in providing school 
buildings and in securing teachers; at present the latter are neces- 
sarily drawn largely from the older Provinces. At the same time 
local normal schools have been established and well equipped for 
providing teachers in the future. The University of Alberta, organ- 
ized in 1907, has nearly 500 students, many of whom will become 
teachers in the secondary schools of the Province. The University 
of Saskatchewan dates from the same year (1907). 
THE BILINGUAL QUESTION. 
The question of bilingual instruction is one of great interest in the 
western Provinces on account of the mixture of populations. During 
the current year Manitoba has been greatly agitated over this question, 
which also is in a measure involved with that of denominational 
schools. A return submitted to the legislature gave the number of 
children attending mono-lingual schools in the Provinces as 64,126 
and those attending bilingual schools as 12,473. It is estimated 
that there are 145 schools for French settlers with 200 bilingual teach- 
ers, 75 German-Mennonite with about 85 teachers, and 107 Ruthe- 
nian, Polish, or Russian-German schools with 107 teachers. 
At a convention of bilingual teachers held at St. Boniface on October 
18 the French Canadians stood firmly by their bilingual schools. 
Early in the same year a provincial school trustees’ convention held 
at Winnipeg passed a resolution providing that wherever 12 scholars 
whose mother tongue is French attend a school “such pupils shall 
have instruction in French, in addition to English, provided the 
parents of said pupils shall make a request to the trustees for such 
additional instruction.”

APPROPRIATION FOR AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
The chief event of the year in respect to education in the Canadian 
Dominion was the passage of the bill already referred to, providing 
an appropriation of $10,000,000 for the encouragement of agri- 
cultural instruction. In his speech supporting this measure, Hon. 
Martin Burrell, minister of agriculture, said: 
In s0 far as this Federal Government is concerned, we have come to the conclusion 
that we can best help on this great work by freely and generously assisting the cause of 
agricultural education. If we are told that this is an innovation, we answer that it is 
the people’s money, drawn from them, and that it is not only defensible but desirable 
that such money should be spent in what we believe to be the most efficient way to 
attain the objects referred to. In choosing education or instruction asa desirable 
line which Federal expenditure should take, we are following the best methods of 
the most progressive countries. We propose to develop what we call the direct work 
of the Federal department by assisting and developing the live-stock, dairying, 
fruit-growing and other industries along lines of investigation, research, improve- 
ment in transportation, markets, and so on, but in respect of funds applied to edu- 
cation we propose to follow what may fairly be termed constitutional lines, using and 
strengthening the machinery already existing in the Provinces, or by them properly 
established. It is proposed by the bill to strengthen all lines of instructional and 
educational work. The particular form such assistance may take may vary with the 
special needs and conditions in each Province. It will embrace the increasing of 
the efliciency and equipment of our agricultural colleges; the establishment of agri- 
cultural schools, of dairy and horticultural schools, of short courses in agriculture; 
the initiation of agricultural teaching in public schools and work by traveling or 
located qualified instructors. It might well include the valuable educational work 
carried on by means of demonstration trains, the training of teachers in nature 
study, and the invaluable work{of domestic science concerned with the women and 
girls of our communities. 
The expenditure of this money is to be extended over 10 years, 
the amounts being allotted to the several Provinces yearly in propor- 
tion to their population. The plan was generally approved, and by 
the close of the year all the Provinces had accepted their allotments 
and had agreed with the Dominion departments as to forms of expen- 
diture. The sum received by each Province for the year ending 
March 31, 1914, was as follows:

EDUCATION IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN 
STATES. 
CoNTENTS.—Progress in Central America and Panama—States of South America: Introduction; educa- 
tional conditions—International relations—Exchange of students between the States—The Normal 
School of Commerce at Montevideo. 
PROGRESS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. 
All reports and advices from the States of Central America show 
increasing efforts to extend primary education. Official reports for 
1913 give for Guatemala an enrollment of 61,163 pupils in primary 
schools, an increase of nearly 4,000 since 1911; in Nicaragua the 
enrollment reported for the same year was 31,000, an increase of 
2,000 pupils in two years; for Costa Rica the enrollment was 33,084, 
as against 29,904 in 1911. In each of the States named the progress 
appears to be due to the opening of new schools where none existed 
before. 
A movement in rural education has been started in Costa Rica 
which promises important results. The experiment was begun under 
the direction of Sr. Brenes-Mesén, at present envoy extraordinary and 
minister plenipotentiary to the United States from Costa Rica, and 
formerly undersecretary of public instruction in that State. During a 
tour of investigation in the United States Sefior Brenes-Mesén was 
impressed with the instruction in community industries as carried 
out in several rural schools, and on his return to his own country, he 
started a school on the same general plan, with adaptations required 
by the different conditions of climate and productions. 
At the request of the Commissioner of Education he has prepared 
the following account of this experiment :* 
Some 4 miles, approximately, from the capital is found the school of-San Vicente, 
which, as it united certain entirely local conditions, was chosen to carry out the 
most important of the experiments. Around the building there is a small field of 
  
1 In the letter to the commissioner accompanying the report Sr. Brenes-Mesén says: “ When, two years 
ago, I had the honor to approach you to solicit a letter of introduction which opened to me all schools and 
facilitated my study of them, I had conceived the plan ofa rural school which would solve as satisfactorily 
as possible our agricultural and social problems. My journey had for its object to investigate the means 
employed in the United States to obtain the same result, and, although I did not find a model which might 
serve definitely, I did find in exchange all the elements and all the data which would contribute to de- 
termine the bases of the experiments which I described to you and which I will try to set forth again in 
this brief report for which you have so kindly asked me.” ae
-P-A-G-E-702
  666 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
some few thousand square meters; it was destined for a garden and orchard in the care 
of the girls. About one-half a kilometer’s distance from the building a field of 2 
hectares was devoted to agricultural experiments. From the very first moment one 
of the conditions desired was obtained—the collaboration of those living near the 
school district in the work of the school children. Because, as they were informed of 
the purpose which was sought—a result which was obtained in a conference that took 
place with the members of the school commission—their cooperation began; neigh- 
bors of the place helped the children to fence in the land, and from that time on their 
interest increased. 
The field was divided into sections, once it was clear, and they were devoted, some 
to the cultivation of the ordinary products of the locality, in two distinct classes, in 
conformity with traditional customs and in conformity with the advice of the depart- 
ment of agriculture, in order that the people might be convinced, practically, of the 
advantages and difficulties of the two proceedings; other portions were destined for 
experiments in new cultivation in the locality. In the school at San Vicente wheat 
was experimented with, and it turned out to be of excellent quality, though it is not 
cultivated on either a great or small scale in the fields of the neighborhood. 
To this work the hours of the morning were devoted; the children worked in groups 
that were responsible for the task given to them. An exact account was kept of the 
value of the work and the products according to the current market prices, and the 
value of the hours of work of the students was computed. All these calculations were 
the basis of exercises in arithmetic and geometry. The problems arose in the same 
field as the herbs and the flowers. There the pupils sang and had their education in 
physics; there they learned botany and agriculture, zoology and meteorology, ap- 
plied to life, avoiding unnecessary technicalities. The themes of conversation and 
composition were produced there without distinction of hours, but mingled with the 
life of every moment of rural activity. 
During the noon hours materials were distributed in such a way that they filled the 
idle time that had been noted in the daily work, and the partial explanations which 
had been made were completed. A preponderant position was occupied by such 
manual work as was adequate for satisfying the necessities of the school in the first 
term—repairing objects in a bad condition, constructing measures and handles, ad- 
justing floors, whitening walls, making boxes for containing the products, rope, etc. 
The girls, for their part, divided their time between work in the kitchen, sewing, 
and learning common matters, subordinating them to the necessities of their daily 
life. Some time during each week was given to gardening and some hours to making 
simple garments, after the pupils had learned to cut them, making use of measures. 
Forty children from the school, breakfasted daily in the dining hall of the school 
with the food prepared by the girls during the kitchen lesson. The purpose of this 
lesson was simply that of learning to cook with the elements used in all the farm- 
houses, in the most suitable way for safe and agreeable nourishment. The products of 
the field were divided in two groups—those which were destined for the school kitchen 
and those which were sent to be sold on the school’s account. 
Among the 40 children—boys and girls—the poorest always breakfasted in the 
school, and, alternately with them, 4 or 6 of the richest of the place, who were chosen 
during the morning according to their conduct or the accomplishment of their duties. 
A student who arrived late did not enjoy the privilege of sitting at the table with his 
companions; hence an almost perfect attendance and new resources of educational 
discipline. After the breakfast each student washed his plate and cover. 
Both the classes in sewing and in kitchen were made so interesting that several 
ladies of the place attended in order to learn what they needed to satisfy their own 
necessities. The school festivals, with the assistance of the authorities, attracted the 
neighbors, so that the school in this way was converted into a small center of popular 
culture.

Some of the girls began to be interested in barnyard fowls, and it was our intention 
to appoint others to the care of bees. At the end of the first year of this experiment, 
a cow was selected for observation, with the plan to buy it and improve its condition 
by care and nourishment so that the children might have a direct observation of the 
change produced in the animal as a consequence of the change of conditions. 
The results of this experiment lead me to the following conclusions: 
1. The ordinary rural school, a modification of the urban school, does not arouse 
the interest of rural populations, and for this reason does ‘not receive their support, 
and on the other hand the rural school, organized as an end to itself and inspired from 
the principle that the school does not prepare for life, but that it is a fragment of life 
itself, worthy of being lived in reality, is converted into a center of cultural education. 
2. Dignifying the tasks of the field is the most efficacious method of avoiding the 
depopulation of the fields. 
8. The rural school must be endowed with the greatest flexibility, to fit itself to the 
necessities of each locality, and it must not be constructed on the same pattern as a 
piece of machinery. 
4. The feeding of poor children within the school attracts the greatest consideration 
and sympathy of the rural population, and the rich people of the place feel themselves 
impelled to protect, defend, and improve it. 
5. The school farm greatly favors the extension of postscholastic culture of an eco- 
nomic and social character. 
Tt entered into my plan, collaborating with the department of agriculture, to place 
within the rural school the elements of savings banks for agricultural purposes. It 
is possible that my successor may introduce this improvement. 
The Government of Panama has adopted measures in accordance 
with a law passed by the last Congress, for the establishment of two 
agricultural schools in the State. An agronomical engineer from 
Paris, Mr. J. René Piot, has been chosen as director of one of the 
institutions, and it is understood that the other will be an American, 
if possible, who is an expert in tropical cultivation. Mr. Piot has been 
engaged in perfecting plans for the buildings and grounds for the first 
school, to be located near New Gorgona. 
It is proposed also that an agricultural experiment station shall be 
established as soon as possible. By a presidential decree issued in 
1913 a night school for adults has been opened in Panama City, in 
which instruction has been given in languages, writing, drawing, 
history, arithmetic, geography, etc., to all males over 15 years of age, 
on all week days, except Thursdays, from 7 to 9 p. m. 
A second decree issued in 1913 provides for the reform of the course 
of study in the National Institute and Normal School for Women. 
STATES OF SOUTH AMERICA. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The importance of closer relations between the United States and 
the South American countries has been emphasized by the com- 
pletion of the Panama Canal and by the changes in commercial 
relations resulting from the war in Europe. These events have also 
given impetus to the efforts in those countries for promoting pop- 
ular education, especially in its relation to industrial progress. In
-P-A-G-E-704
  668 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
many of the States these efforts are interrupted by political dis- 
turbances and are hindered by the lack of financial resources; 
in other States educational activity is steady and well supported, 
at least in particular districts and populous centers. The increase 
of population by immigration is an important factor in the de- 
velopment of several of the South American countries, notably 
Argentina, Uruguay, and certain States of Brazil. All of these have 
offered inducements to settlers in the way of favorable terms for farm 
lands, distribution of seeds, and aid in securing implements and 
stock. Many colonies of farmers and farm laborers, chiefly from 
Italy, Portugal, and Germany have been established, and these new- 
comers are eager to secure for their children education and opportu- 
nity in the New World. 
EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS. 
Theoretically every State of South America has a comprehensive 
system of education, including elementary and secondary schools and 
higher institutions. The traditional regard for the education of a 
select class has been accompanied by indifference to popular educa- 
tion; so that while secondary schools and universities have been 
supported,’ primary education for the masses has been neglected. 
At the present time, there is a general movement throughout South 
America to overcome this tendency; but the lack of comprehensive 
surveys makes it difficult to show the actual condition. In the lead-- 
ing States investigation has recently been made for the purpose of 
obtaining accurate information respecting the provision of elementary 
schools and school attendance. The most complete statement thus 
far issued covering the subject was comprised in the third census of 
Argentina. According to estimates based upon that census, the 
population of this State in 1912 was about 7,500,000, of whom 30,000 
were Indians. The new arrivals in the country during that year 
numbered 287,000 (165,662 Italians; 80,583 Spaniards). Educa- 
tional statistics for the same year show an enrollment in public 
primary schools of 666,049 pupils; in private primary schools of 
113,944, a total enrollment equivalent to 10.3 per cent of the 
population. 
Brazil has a land area greater than that of the United States, 
omitting the outlying possessions of the latter. Its estimated popu- 
lation in 1913 was 24,308,219, the average density of population 
being 5.4 per square mile; in the Federal District the density reaches 
1,359 per square mile, but of the several States only six exceed 20 
inhabitants to a square mile. The population is not only widely 
scattered in the greater part of the country, but is in a low state of

intellectual and industrial advancement, which renders the spread of 
education extremely difficult. The eastern States, however, are 
active in promoting both primary and industrial education, and the 
cities on the coast compare favorably with cities of the leading na- 
tions in the number and equipment of their public schools. 
Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, is noted for its fine school 
buildings, which are specially adapted to the tropical climate. A 
characteristic type is illustrated by the Escola Ferreira Vianna, which 
occupies a one-story building with windows opening on all sides; the 
spacious grounds afford ample room for recreation, and also for deco- 
rative plants, shrubbery, and shade trees. Jl the classrooms are 
well supplied with modern appliances, globes, maps, charts, black- 
boards, etc., and are adorned with pictures, including the portraits 
of eminent men. 
Among schools arranged for open-air classes is the Escola Campos 
Salles, which is situated in the midst of a beautiful grove, where 
noonday lunch is served to the children. 
At the head of the system of public education in Rio de Janeiro are 
two technical schools, one for boys, the other for girls; these schools 
are supplied with workshops, finely equipped drawing rooms, and all 
the needed appliances for teaching manual arts, specialized according 
to the careers open to boys and girls respectively. The girls are 
trained in dressmaking, millinery, and laundry work. A special feature 
of the technical school for boys is the military drill, which is con- 
ducted by officers detailed for that purpose. The military band of 
this school is often called to take part in competitive exercises. 
The city maintains a fine service of medical inspection for its 
schools, in which respect, however, it is fully equaled by the city of 
Sao Paulo, as well as by Buenos Aires and Montevideo in the neighbor- 
ing States. 
The statistical bureau of Chile, in its report published in 1913, 
brings the survey of the country down to December 31, 1912. The 
population at that date was 3,505,317, an increase of 256,038 above 
the total given in the census of 1907. Primary schools to the number 
of 2,947 are supported by the Government, which also subsidizes 302 
private primary schools; the enrollment in the Government schools 
in 1912 was 287,115; in subsidized primary schools, 36,577. For 
secondary education there are 78 liceos, of which 40 are for boys and 
30 for girls. There are also 44 monastery or convent schools of second- 
ary grade, which receive no aid from the State, and 79 private second- 
ary institutions aided by the State. 
The importance of commercial education is indicated by the fact 
that there are 11 institutions having this order of instruction; these 
are supported in whole or in part by the Government. The Instituto 
Superior de Comercio ranks high among schools of this class.  
-P-A-G-E-706
  670 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Provision for technical and industrial education for boys is made by 
numerous well-equipped institutions, which enrolled in 1912 a total 
of 6,368 students. In the vocational schools for girls, of correspond- 
ing grade, there were 4,414 students. 
Recently great interest has been shown in physical culture and 
manual training; it is estimated that 22,000 pupils receive instruction 
in the use of tools in the workshops annexed to public schools and 
6,500 pupils similar training in special schools. 
For higher education there is a State university at Santiago 
registering annually about 2,000 students and a Catholic university 
at the same city with about 250 students. During the current year 
the Chilean Government developed a comprehensive scheme of public 
buildings to be carried out in 10 years, at a total cost of $22,995,000. 
The work is in charge of the general inspector of architecture at 
Santiago, and includes, in addition to several important Government 
buildings, many public schoolhouses. The latter are indispensable 
for the realization of plans for increasing school attendance adopted 
by the Government in 1913. In accordance with these plans, 
appropriations for the schools have been increased, amounting in 
round numbers to $8,000,000 for the current year. 
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 
The policy of sending selected students, at Government expense, 
to complete their liberal or professional studies in foreign countries, is 
one of long standing in the States of both Central and South America. 
Preference has generally been given to French or German universities 
and technical schools, the choice having been determined partly by the 
reputation of the institutions and partly by racial and intellectual 
sympathies. The latter have been promoted by the influence of 
young men and women of wealthy families who in large numbers are 
sent to European schools and by the immediate efforts of professors 
and teachers from European countries who are found in many of the 
chief institutions of Latin America. 
For the promotion of intellectual relations with the countries 
considered, France maintains a regular organization, the “Groupe- 
ment des Universités et Grandes Ecoles de France pour Rap- 
ports avec l’Amérique Latine.” This work is conducted under 
university auspices, with aid from the Government, and is carried 
on by the exchange of professors, by publications, and by the agency 
of a permanent office in Paris which comprises a library of works 
having to do with Latin-American affairs. 
For the information of students of those countries the organization 
has prepared a manual in the Spanish language relating to the uni- 
versities and special schools of France. This publication is freely 
circulated in South and Central America.
-P-A-G-E-707
  EDUCATION IN SOUTH AMERICA, 671 
In a less formal manner a knowledge of German institutions is 
brought to the attention of the student world of South America, and 
the educational methods and system of Germany have been impressed 
upon important institutions at several centers by the employment 
of professors from that country. 
In this respect the influence of the United States upon the States 
of Latin America is comparatively small, although there appears to 
be an increasing disposition to assign students to the colleges and 
technical schools in this country. 
Apart from Government action in this matter, many parents, 
especially in Mexico and Central America, who send their sons and 
daughters abroad to finish their education, prefer schools in the 
United States. This choice is generally determined by religious 
sympathies. Catholic schools in California are particularly attractive, 
and representatives of the College of Christian Brothers, St. Louis, 
Mo., and nuns from the Convents of the Sacred Heart in that city 
and St. Charles have been successful by their personal influence in 
securing students from Mexico and other Latin States for those 
institutions. 
The following statements indicate means by which the foreign 
relations are promoted at present: 
Chile——The Pedagogic Institute at Santiago de Chile has been a 
center of German influence from its origin in 1813, when the faculty 
was largely drawn from that country. There are at present 35 Ger- 
man colleges in that Republic; the Chilean Army has German instruc- 
tors and sends a number of officers yearly to Germany for military 
instruction. 
On the occasion of the recent visit of representatives of the Boston 
Chamber of Commerce to Chile, Sr. Carrasco, chief of the commercial 
section of the department of foreign affairs, expressed the opinion 
that his Government would be willing to send a number of young 
university graduates to the United States and bear the expense of 
their journey. The plan is likely to be soon realized through the 
public spirit of a prominent Chilean, Sr. Don David Montt, resident 
in the United States, who has arranged to carry out the details of the 
scheme with the hope of bringing into closer relations the commercial 
interests of the two countries. 
Ecuador has a number of students studying the plastic arts in 
Europe, and the superior board of public instruction of Quito has 
recently issued regulations providing that each scholarship student 
of this class shall forward annually to the department of public 
instruction of Ecuador two samples of his work in the branch of art 
to which he is assigned under the contract granting him a scholar- 
ship. Examples are to be exhibited in a special section of the annual 
exposition of fine arts held in Quito August 10. Art students not 
complying with these requirements will forfeit their scholarships.
-P-A-G-E-708
  672 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The Government of Ecuador has also recently contracted for a 
French instructor to teach in the normal school at Ambato. 
Venezuela—An executive decree of September, 1909, created 
scholarship funds available for young men who are selected to pursue 
studies or research in foreign countries. As a rule selection is made 
of graduates who are prepared for advanced studies or who engage to 
pursue a specialty. Choice is made in every case of technical institu- 
tions of high repute. Within the last decade there has been an 
increase in the number of students sent to technical schools of the 
United States. In 1918, out of 13 student holders of Government 
scholarships, 9 were sent to European institutions and 4 to those of the 
United States. The amount allowed by the Venezuelan Government 
for this purpose was 58,920 bolivars ($11,371). 
Paraguay has several students in the higher art institutions of 
Italy who send to their Government periodical reports of their 
progress. 
As a result of the efforts for promoting scholastic relations between 
France and Latin America, exchanges of university professors have 
already been arranged as follows: In 1912, M. Sauvaire-Jourdan, 
professor of law at the University of Bordeaux, and Dr. Bonnet, of 
the Pasteur Institute, were sent to the University of Santiago de 
Chile. The same French professors will begin an exchange with 
the University of Buenos Aires in January, 1915. In both these 
cases the expenses of the professors are paid by the university visited. 
In exchange, lectures have been arranged for at the French universi- 
ties by professors from Santiago and Buenos Aires. An informal 
exchange has taken place between France and Brazil resulting in a 
“Course of Brazilian studies” given by lectures at the Sorbonne, and 
corresponding lectures at Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo by pro- 
fessors from France. 
INTERCHANGE OF STUDENTS BETWEEN LATIN-AMERICAN STATES, 
Peculiar interest attaches to- the exchange of students between 
neighboring States in South America. Six young girls of Brazil have 
received scholarships giving them free tuition in the normal school at 
Montevideo. Three of these scholarships were provided by the 
Government of Uruguay and the other three by the Brazilian State 
of Rio Grande do Sul. 
Preliminary measures have been taken during the present year for 
the establishment of an industrial Chilean-Argentine college to prepare 
students for industrial posts in the two countries. 
The normal schools at Santiago de Chile, at Montevideo, Uruguay, 
and at Sucre, Bolivia, are institutions of high repute to which many 
intending teachers from neighboring States go for professional training.

THE NORMAL SCHOOL OF COMMERCE, MONTEVIDEO. 
‘The importance of the Normal School of Commerce at Montevideo, 
Uruguay, as a center of influence has been greatly increased by a 
recent executive order providing for the establishment of a museum 
of manufactures as an adjunct of the college. The order is as follows:

        INTRODUCTION. 
Great Britain and Ireland form a constitutional monarchy, com- 
prising a population of 46,035,570 (estimated 1913), distributed as . 
follows: England, 36,919,339; Scotland, 4,733,700 ; Ireland, 4,382,531. 
The three divisions have independent systems of education, but all 
are aided by Parliamentary grants. The direct control of education 
rests in each division with local authorities; for the administration 
of the grants, central departments or boards have been created with 
authority to determine the conditions upon which schools and school 
managers may share in the grants.

         THE SYSTEM OF 
  EXPANSION OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
   The English system of State-aided education was limited at the 
beginning to elementary education, which still forms its main work. 
The system is based upon the Forster Act of 1870, by which the Gov- 
ernment assumed the responsibility of seeing that every child in the 
Kingdom should have access to an approved elementary school. The 
duty of establishing these schools was placed upon local authorities, 
who received grants from the Government in aid of the work upon 
specified conditions. For the administration of the grants a central 
authority (committee of council) was formed, which maintained an 
inspection of the schools in respect to the conditions upon which 
the grants were allowed. The province of the Central Government 
in this respect and the obligation of local authorities have been greatly 
: 675     
-P-A-G-E-712
   
  676 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
extended by acts passed since 1870. Special importance attaches 
to the act of 1899, creating the board of education as the central 
agency for all the educational work carried on by the Government, 
and the education act of 1902, by which the local administration of 
the system was radically changed. 
Immediately after the declaration of war the elementary education 
(war service superannuation) act, 1914, was passed. This measure 
gives the necessary authority for fulfilling a promise already made by 
the board of education that time given by a certificated teacher to 
military service or other service arising out of war will be counted 
equally with service in the schools for superannuation purposes. 
More than a thousand teachers were reported as being subject to 
the provisions of this act. : 
At the time the board of education was created, the Government 
was appropriating for the maintenance of elementary schools in 
England and Wales about £8,000,000 ($40,000,000) annually. For 
this purpose alone the annual grants have now reached about £12,- 
000,000 ($60,000,000), while at least £1,200,000 ($6,000,000) addi- 
tional are disbursed for purposes of secondary and technical educa- 
tion, which have been brought within the province of the board. 
During the same period the expenditure by local authorities for ele- 
mentary schools has risen from about £5,000,000 to £14,000,000 
($70,000,000) and they contribute an additional £2,000,000 ($10,000,- 
000) for the purpose of secondary and technical education. These 
amounts may be taken as the measure of the increase in the provision 
for the education of the industrial classes of England. This increase 
has been accompanied by a gradual breaking down of barriers between 
the State-aided elementary school system and the great body of 
private schools which formerly were limited to the children of profes- 
sional classes, the landed gentry, capitalists, etc., so that social uni- 
fication and the spread of democratic principles have been promoted 
by the natural growth of the school system established by the law 
of 1870. 
The entire amount allowed for the service of the board of education 
for the year ending March 31, 1914-15, is £15,245,621 ($74,093,818). 
This includes the additional grants specified above. 
The development fund, created by Parliamentary act of 1909, 
provides for the disbursement of £500,000 ($2,500,000) annually for 
five years ending March 31, 1915, plus such sums as may be voted by 
Parliament. The total amount guaranteed to the fund is £2,900,000 
($14,500,000) up to the end of the financial year 1914-15. The com- 
mittee appointed to administer the fund estimate £900,000 as the 
expenditure from this source for purposes of agticultural research and 
instruction up to March 31, 1916; for forestry appropriations, largely 
for research and education, £350,000.

EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 677 
SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
The elementary schools recognized for grants by the board of 
education enrolled during the present year nearly 6,150,000 pupils 
and employed 170,000 teachers. In a general survey of the year, 
the president of the board states that the provision of elementary 
schools in the country is now adequate to the demand, and in many 
respects the conduct of the schools and the manner in which the 
school authorities are providing for the general welfare of the school 
children are highly satisfactory. The weak points in the system 
upon which he dwelt are the failure of the schools to retain pupils 
after the age limit of compulsory attendance is past, and the lack of 
continuation schools. In regard to the former of these deficiencies 
Mr. Pease said: 
Out of the 600,000 children who leave our elementary schools each year, 35,000 are 
half timers, 13,000 leave under the age of 13, 176,000 leave at age of 13— on their birth- 
day or thereabouts, 336,000 leave during the age of 13, and only 40,000 remain after 
the age of 14. The fact that 176,000 leave at the age of 13 shows what an enormous 
proportion leave the very first moment they have an opportunity of doing so. Al- 
though they are to a large extent more alert than they used to be, yet they have just 
reached the age when they are capable of understanding the reasons and principles 
of what they are learning and how to apply their knowledge. 
In regard to provision for continuing the education of the young, 
the president of the board said: 
The greatest blot on our system is that the great mass of our elementary schools have 
to. submit to losing large numbers of their scholars just when a good teacher 
could do most for their mental, moral, and physical development. We have a 
continuation system which is purely voluntary and almost exclusively connected 
with evening teaching. I want to do justice to evening schools, but I would 
point out that in regard to the proportion of students under 18 in attendance at even- 
ing schools, only 5 per cent between 14 and 18 are estimated to be still in attendance 
at elementary schools, secondary schools, and other places of full-time education. Of 
the 2,391,000 left available for evening schools, only 14 per cent, or 334,000, are in 
nominal attendance during a single year. The percentage of pupils who begin at 
the beginning of the course and go on continuously is only 53, and while the aggregate 
student-hours that can be worked by juvenile students is 287,000,000, the actual is 
18,500,000. 
The local authorities are directly responsible for these evils, but 
the Government has power to hasten their correction through the 
control of grants-in-aid. 
LEGISLATION. 
Early in the year the expectation was entertained that a bill would 
be introduced providing for the large reform in education fore- 
shadowed last year by the president of the board of education and 
by Viscount Haldane, the lord chancellor. The bill was not forth- 
coming. The chief educational measure pertains to financial mat- 
ters and was embodied in the budget estimates submitted by Mr.

Pease, president of the board. His proposition was twofold; it 
called for a reorganization of the grants for specific purposes. Even- 
tually the measure was divided, and attention for the time directed 
wholly to the additional grants. The estimates for the latter received 
the royal assent July 31, and the portion of the grant for the four 
months ending December 31, namely, £515,000 ($2,503,000), be- 
came immediately available. This amount is to be applied to the 
relief of local school taxes (the ‘‘ Necessitous Areas Grant’’) and to the 
maintenance of medical inspection, medical treatment, provision of 
meals, ete. The former purpose absorbs £438,000 of the supple- 
mentary vote; the latter, the remaining £77,000, raising the entire 
amount for the medical service for the current year to £252,000 
($1,127,520). 
The ‘‘Education (provision of meals) act, 1914,” and the ‘‘Ele- 
mentary education (defective and epileptic children) act” were 
passed just upon the adjournment of Parliament. The former en- 
larges the powers of local authorities with respect to providing meals, 
at public expense, for necessitous school children, not only during 
the time the schools are in session, but in the holidays and vaca- 
tions also. Under the circumstances it has practically the character 
of an emergency war-time measure. The second act referred to 
gives the local authorities increased power in respect to the education 
of defective children. For this purpose, in extreme cases, such 
children may be removed from the control of parents who will not 
consent to have them properly trained. - 
WELFARE SERVICES. 
England affords an impressive example of the combination of cen- 
tral and local authorities in the promotion of welfare services for 
school ‘children. Like the establishment of the schools themselves, 
provision for these services rests with the local authorities, but the 
Government gives financial aid and has had great effect in unifying 
and directing the services. The report of the chief medical officer 
shows that with a single exception all the local authorities have 
established some form cf medical inspection of schools and school 
children in their areas, There are 1,097 medical officers engaged in 
this work, including 84 women and 300 specialists for the treatment 
of the eyes, ears, and teeth. Out of the total 318 authorities, 125 
are employing school nurses, 48 provide for the X-ray treatment of 
ringworms, 115 have established their own school clinics, and 300 
hospitals are used for the treatment of infantile complaints. In con- 
nection with the medical inspection, open-air schools have multi- 
plied, accommodating 945 children; schools for mothers have arisen 
as a branch of the medical work, and of 200 such schools 33 received 
during the year grants from the General Government. The pro-
-P-A-G-E-715
  
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 679 
vision of meals for necessitous children has been promoted by the 
medical inspection, which has established the fact that underfeed- 
ing is one of the chief causes of physical infirmities in children and 
of their inability to keep up with their classes. In addition to these 
services, which are intended for children attending the ordinary 
schools, the local education authorities maintain 369 special schools 
for comparatively hopeless cases, such as epileptics, the mentally 
defective, cripples, deaf and dumb children, and blind children. 
These services are very costly, and taken in connection with the 
improvement in the teaching force and in school buildings required 
by the Government, entail large expenditures upon the local authori- 
ties. Hence, the significance of the additional grants for necessi- 
tous areas—that is, areas that have reached the limit of local school 
taxes—and the grants-in-aid of the various branches of welfare work. 
THE TEACHING SERVICE. 
In a speech before the House of Commons on the budget estimates 
for the current year, Mr. Pease dwelt upon the difficulty of recruiting 
the teaching service. At least 9,000 new teachers are required 
annually to fill vacancies, but the training colleges do not send out 
half this number; in 1912 only 4,007 students passed the final exam- 
ination entitling them to the Government certificate. The number 
of young people who enter upon preparation for the training colleges 
fell from 11,018 in 1906-7 to 4,486 in 1913-14. Among the causes 
of this threatened dearth’ of teachers, the chief is the small induce- 
ment offered by the service as compared with other occupations 
that are now within reach of the same class of people. Although 
there has been a slight increase in the average salaries of teachers 
during a decade, they have not kept pace with the increased cost of 
living, and the prospects of promotion are even less than formerly. 
To these discouragements must be added the length of time required 
for preparation and the inability of parents to provide for their chil- 
dren during this time, especially when the chance of earning in other 
vocations is open to them. The deficiency of properly trained teach- 
ers affected chiefly the rural schools. Two measures are suggested 
by the president of the board of education for overcoming this evil: 
First, the increase of “maintenance allowances” by local authorities. 
This would relieve the family of the cost of a student’s living during 
the period of preparation. The second measure is the revival, in 
modified form, of the pupil-teacher system. The latter action has 
been determined upon. Mr. Pease says: 
We have revived the pupil-teacher system in rural districts, but we have done it 
in a very different way from that which formerly existed. The oid pupil-teacher 
system failed because it was frequently the hopeless case of a tired teacher instructing 
a tired pupil. This will now be avoided, because the pupil-teacher will not be  
-P-A-G-E-716
  
  680 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
allowed to count on the staff, and he may not teach more than half time. We pro- 
pose to give grants increased from £20 to £42 for pupils living outside the range of 
secondary schools; the pupils will be taught partly by head teachers and partly by 
subsidiary central classes. 
What may be called the grievance of teachers was emphasized dur- 
ing the year in an address before the National Union of Teachers, to 
be presently considered. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
The interest in the subject of teacher training is emphasized by a 
review of the history of the training colleges (normal schools) of 
England, in the current report of the board of education. This 
review covers two eras, the first extending down to 1890, prior to 
which all the State-aided training colleges were under private manage- 
ment (chiefly denominational) and were residential schools directing 
the entire life of the students during the period of training. 
In 1890 the Government agreed to recognize, for grants, day train- 
ing colleges attached to the universities, and the education act of 
1902 sanctioned the use of public funds by local authorities for the 
support of training schools; thus new types of institutions were 
brought into the field. The spirit and methods of the training were 
affected by the new institutions, and also by the demands of the times. 
These changes were reflected in the regulations (code) issued by the 
Government in 1904, which therefore marks an important stage in 
this history. Z : 
The older regulations outlined a program of secular subjects which 
was followed by all the colleges and prepared all students for the 
same official examinations. This uniformity was broken up, partly 
as a consequence of the relation established between the day train- 
ing colleges and the universities, and partly by the call for new sub- 
jects of instruction. The course of study was thenceforth modified 
in many ways to meet the needs of individual institutions and students. 
At present many of the students do not take the official examinations 
at all, but prepare for university examinations which are accepted 
by the board of education as equivalent to their own. A second 
and very important change that has taken place relates to the staff 
of the institutions. The choice of principals and teachers formerly 
rested with the managers of a college. Since 1905 the board of 
education has required that all proposals for appointment to the 
teaching staff of the colleges, including the post of principal, shall be 
submitted to it for approval, together with full details as to the qual- 
ifications. A reasonable proportion of the staff of a college must be 
university graduates, and regulations have been made to secure the 
appointment of women as principals and lecturers in colleges for 
women or in mixed colleges
-P-A-G-E-717
  
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 681 
The employment of a higher type of teachers has brought a marked 
change in the conduct of studies. Under the early system instruc- 
tion was conveyed almost entirely by lectures; for this system the 
colleges are substituting, more and more, the instruction of students 
in small classes. In this way the exercises are. more closely adapted 
to the attainments and interests of the students, free discussion dur- 
ing class hour is encouraged, and the students have time for private 
study, which was hardly possible when their time and energies were 
exhausted by transcribing and memorizing notes of lectures. 
The improvement in the conduct of studies in the training colleges 
is particularly shown in the matter of English language and litera- 
ture. The grammatical ‘‘subtleties” that formed a prominent fea- 
ture in the older examinations have been replaced by the study of 
select authors with the hope of exciting a general love of literature. 
Since 1904 the program has been extended by the addition of the 
semiprofessional subjects of physical training and hygiene. The 
official syllabus of physical exercises for public elementary schools 
has been introduced into the colleges. Expert inspectors have been 
employed to test the students’ proficiency in the syllabus, and their 
ability to teach it with success; instruction in hygiene has also been 
made compulsory for the majority of the students. 
The municipal training colleges naturally draw their students 
from a limited locality, and consequently their advantages are offset 
in a measure by the danger of ‘inbreeding.’ Some efforts have 
been made by local authorities to correct this tendency by selecting 
only a portion of their teachers from the output of their own colleges. 
A surer corrective is likely to be found in the provision for residence, 
which nearly all of the municipal colleges are taking measures to 
supply. 
The relation between day training colleges and the universities 
gave students the chance to secure a university diploma, and this 
opportunity was eagerly seized by the more ambitious, and their 
efforts were encouraged by the education department. Two orders 
of training have resulted, one based on the needs of elementary 
schools, the other animated by university purposes. Experience 
shows that while the stronger students in the day colleges fare 
better than they would have done in the old residential colleges, the 
weaker students are worse off. There are difficulties in the way 
even of those best able to work for the degrees. The university 
teaching, having been intended to provide for university students, 
is unsuited to men of lower attainments; at the same time many 
students who really are not capable of taking the higher studies 
make the endeavor, instead of increasing their imperfect knowledge 
of the subjects which they must eventually teach. Moreover, the 
degree course of a university requires a student’s undivided energies 
  i 
 
-P-A-G-E-718
  682 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
for three years; but in the case of one preparing for a teacher’s posi- 
tion, this work must be combined with professional training. Under 
these circumstances it is not possible for the intending teacher to 
compete with other university students unless he neglects subjects 
which are essential in his subsequent career as a teacher. 
Thus a contest has arisen between the claims of academic and 
unacademic subjects. The board of education discusses the diffi- 
culty, but so far has offered no remedy. The suggestion, however, 
is made that a graduate from a training college should be allowed 
to pursue a two-year course of university study after graduation. 
This is practically the arrangement in Saxony for graduate teachers 
who are admitted to Leipzig University. 
The development that has taken place in tho professional train- 
ing of teachers reacts upon the service. The more highly trained 
teachers naturally require and need increased salaries, and this 
places them beyond the reach of rural schools and even of the schools 
of small towns; indeed, in England, as elsewhere, the salary question 
is the critical one in popular education. 
ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS. 
The National Union of Teachers exerts great influence by reason 
of its large membership, which has reached 88,000, and its means of 
affecting public opinion. The union has four representatives in 
Parliament, and maintains an organ, The Schoolmaster, which is 
ably edited and strong in its advocacy of popular education. The 
annual meeting of the association was held this year at Lowestoft 
during Easter week, as usual. The president, Mr. W. B. Steer, 
assistant master of the municipal secondary school, Derby, in his 
inaugural address discussed the status of the teachers under two 
main considerations, namely, their remuneration and the unpopu- 
larity of the profession itself. He declared that “there are at least 
14,650 fully qualified teachers serving to-day in the nation’s schools 
who can not be said to be earning a living wage.” This contention 
was supported by the facts relative to the average salary of certifi- 
cated teachers, with respect to which Mr. Steer said: 
The average salary of £146 3s. ($730) which the nation pays its certified masters is 
absolutely and relatively inadequate—absolutely because it compels the teacher to 
live a narrower life both socially and mentally than is good for the influence which 
he is required to wield, and relatively because, with equal capacity, a man can secure 
a much better remuneration in other professions. And the same thing must be said 
of the average salary of £101 ($500) which the nation pays its certified mistresses. 
From a patriotic standpoint the claim of the National Union of Teachers is entirely 
wise, for the potential recruits will not enter the teaching profession until the nation 
can assure an eventual salary of at least £200 per year to every man and £160 to every 
woman who responds to the call, with higher remuneration still should their industry 
and success and the smiling face of fortune lead to promotion to the head teachership 
of a school.
-P-A-G-E-719
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 683 
Other causes for the unpopularity of the service were summed up 
as follows: 
(1) The fact that the qualities which the country demands from its teachers it does 
not hold in real esteem; (2) the belittling of the teacher’s certificate by the board of 
education itself, and by education authorities generally; (3) the lack of consistency 
in the character of the certificate from year to year; (4) the employment of unqualified 
teachers; (5) the absence of a register of qualified teachers; (6) the denial to teachers 
of a share of the control of education; (7) the control of education by men who have 
had little or no experience of the work, and frequently the poorest ideas of the aim of 
the school and the possible scope of the curriculum; (8) the consequent adoption of 
impracticable and even false standards by which teaching may be judged—standards 
not based upon generally accepted pedagogical principles, but upon the mere intui- 
tions, whims, and caprices of the reigning sphinx in office; (9) the closing of the legiti- 
mate avenues of promotion to the teacher; (10) an inordinate worship of university 
training as the sole qualification for administrative and inspectorial posts; (11) the 
division of the profession of education into water-tight compartments. 
The recent creation of a new grade of assistant inspectors, to 
which teachers are eligible, was pronounced a “grudging concession.” 
The position is not available to teachers after they are 45 years of 
age. The salary attached to the position is not high, and the age limit 
cuts out the men and, to some extent, the women whose service is 
rendered in large towns, where promotion to head teachership does 
not come until the forty-fifth birthday has passed. 
At the last meeting of the session a resolution was adopted, 
authorizing the executive to put forth all possible effort, both locally 
and nationally, to secure the adoption of a standard scale of salaries 
for certificated class teachers in primary schools. The scale de- 
manded was as follows: For provincial class teachers, men, mini- 
mum, £90 ($450); maximum, £200 ($1,000), to be attained by 
automatic increments; women, minimum, £80 ($400); maximum, 
£160 ($800), to be reached also by automatic increments. For 
metropolitan and extra metropolitan class teachers, men, minimum, 
£100 ($500); maximum, £250 ($1,250); women, minimum, £90 
($450); maximum, £200 ($1,000). - 
The resolution excited discussion because of the difference between 
the range of salaries demanded for men and women teachers, but 
all proposed modifications were rejected in view of the difficulty of 
securing men teachers. The vote in favor of the resolution was 
finally declared unanimous. 
NORTH OF ENGLAND EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE. 
The twelfth annual meeting of the north of England educational 
conference was held at Bradford January 1 to 3 of the current year, 
and was characterized, as usual, by discussions of the social bearings 
of education. The keynote of the meeting was struck at the opening 
session by Dr. Sadler, who took for his subject “The present dis- 
   
-P-A-G-E-720
    684 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
contents in English education.” The following citation from his ad- 
dress is particularly significant in view of the just complaints of the 
teaching body as voiced in the proceedings of their own association. 
Dr. Sadler said: 
So far from English teachers as a mass being at the present time disheartened about 
their work, or disillusioned with their lot, there never has been a time within living 
memory when so many of them were enthusiastic about their wozk or so willing to 
give unsparingly of the leisure of their holidays to self-training and further study. 
Holiday courses in England are hardly more than 20 years old. Year by year the 
number, the attendance at them, their success, increase. Only those whose busi- 
ness it is to watch this significant movement know how far-reaching it is, how deeply 
it is affecting the educational situation. Thronged summer gatherings, attended by 
hundreds of teachers for two or three weeks together, are now so usual as hardly to 
receive notice in the press. Again, any new contribution to educational thought 
is hailed at once with interest and eager curiosity. When Jacques-Dalcroze came 
to England a year ago the largest halls could hardly hold the number of teachers 
who wished tohearhim. IfMadame Montessori came to England (as I hope she may), 
she would have to give her lecture twice over in every town she visited. Mr. Ed- 
mond Holmes, who is the Gordon Craig of English educational literature, has an 
audience of readers upon ascale which, in his lifetime, Matthew Arnold utterly failed 
to find. Again, if you go to any experienced inspector, he can take you to schools 
in his district where there is work of high promise and originality, due to the char- 
acter or artistic power of some perhaps obscure teacher, and bearing fruit in a new 
kind of discipline among the children and in a new relation of confidence between 
the school and the home. Platform hacks talk about the chaos of English education, 
It isa cheerful chaos. It is growth, not decay, which is the cause of the conclusion. 
There are scores of private schools, even the names of which are not known to the 
wider public, which are full of a fine spirit of educational originality, combined with 
a reverent regard for the wisdom of precedent. Principal Griffiths 1 did not men- 
tion the education of girls. Yet, after all, girls are more than half the English race. 
We live in an age in which girls’ schools have for the first time in England been cre- 
ated on a national scale. What body of educational opinion is there amongst us so 
well considered, so honest, and yet so hopeful as that of the head mistresses and as- 
sistant mistresses of our secondary schools for girls? Principal Griffiths’s picture is 
like a painting by some of the Dutch masters, a little dark and gloomy; but even 
he has his high lights. He spoke with just enthusiasm of the promise and perform- 
ance of the tutorial classes organized by the universities in union with the branches 
of the Workers’ Educational Association, and with the help of local authorities and 
the Government. Perhaps by concentrating too much of his praise on this one 
feature of the educational outlook he did unwittingly a little injustice to other tend- 
encies and other movements, in their way not less encouraging. This upthrust of 
interest in the things of the mind, which is a mark of the best working-class opinion 
in England at the present time, is one of a dozen signs of hope for the future, but it 
is also a sign and an outcome and a cause of unrest. We are in for stormy weather, 
but there is something exhilarating in a storm.

What Bacon said about the planting of colonies is true of the making of an educa- 
tional system: “It is like the planting of woods. You must make your account to 
lose almost 20 years’ profit and expect your recompense in the end.””

SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
The education act of 1902 extends the obligation of local educa- 
tion authorities beyond the provision of elementary education by 
the following clause: 
The local education authority shall consider the educational needs of their area 
and take such steps as seem to them desirable, after consultation with the board of 
education, to supply or aid the supply of education other than elementary, and to 
promote the general coordination of all forms of education, and for that purpose shall 
apply all or so much as they deem necessary of the residue under section 1 of the 
local taxation (customs and excise) act, 1890, and shall carry forward for the like 
purpose any balance thereof which may remain unexpended, and may spend such 
further sums as they think fit: Provided, That the amount raised by the council of 
a county for the purpose in any year out of rates under this act shall not exceed the 
amount which would be produced by a rate of 2 pence in the pound, or such higher 
rate as the county council, with the consent of the local government board, may fix. 
  
1 Includes household expenses.

  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 687 
In accordance with this requirement, nearly all educational 
authorities in the Kingdom have taken measures to aid private 
secondary schools and bring them under public supervision, and at 
the same time they have established new schools of secondary 
character, supported entirely by public funds. The board of educa- 
tion also allows grants for schools of this class, and thus they are 
brought within the general system of State-aided education. 
The board defines a secondary school as one which— 
offers to each of its pupils a progressive course of instruction (with the requisite organi- 
zation, curriculum, teaching staff, and equipment) in the subjects necessary to a 
good general education, upon lines suitable for pupils of an age range at least as wide 
as from 12 to 17. 
The school must submit to Government inspection and must 
retain a fair proportion of its pupils for a four-year course of sec- 
ondary instruction, extending ‘“‘up to and beyond the age of 16”; 
if provision is made in the schools for pupils below the age of 12, 
this elementary work must be kept in proper relation to the main 
purpose of the school; in case there are less than 20 pupils over 
12 years of age, the school is not recognized by the board as of 
secondary grade. 
It is somewhat difficult to adapt private schools, which have 
long followed traditional courses of study, to modern demands. 
The official requirements for the grant-aided schools are explicit in 
respect to facilities for science teaching, and they offer special in- 
ducements for vocational training. The measure of success in the 
latter direction is shown by the fact that 74 of the schools report 
facilities for this order of instruction. Of these, 34 maintain courses 
of a rural or agricultural character, 25 maintain commercial courses, 
14 special courses in domestic science for girls, and 8 engineering 
courses for boys. Instruction in needlework is obligatory in all 
girls’ schools, and instruction in cookery is very general; the voca- 
tional course is defined as one “combining with these other sub- 
jects of housecraft in a course which has for its distinct object the 
preparation for general household work, whether in the home or 
under an employer.” 
According to the latest official report the number of secondary 
schools in England receiving grants was 898, including 402 controlled 
by local authorities, 424 endowed schools, 26 schools belonging to the 
Girls’ Public Day School Trust, and 46 controlled by Roman Catholic 
orders or communities. These schools enrolled 158,832 pupils 
(85,110 boys, 73,722 girls), and employed 9,126 full-time teachers and 
about 3,000 part-time instructors. The latter are generally required 
for special instruction, such as physical exercise or handicraft. 
As a condition of receiving the Government grant, a secondary 
school must provide a certain proportion of free places open to the  
-P-A-G-E-724
    688 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
class of children that attend the public elementary schools. Originally 
this requirement was 25 per cent of the accommodation in the school, 
but the proportion may be reduced under certain conditions. For 
the year under review, approximately one-fourth of the pupils 
(nearly 40,000) in the schools considered were holders of free places 
intended for pupils transferred from the public elementary schools, 
The local authorities maintain scholarships covering the tuition fees 
for such pupils and, in some cases, a living allowance, which is paid 
to the parents. In this way secondary schools, formerly limited to 
the more-favored social classes, have been brought within the reach 
of poor children of exceptional capacity. This arrangement has 
proved beneficial to individuals, although it does not satisfy the 
democratic demand for an open road for all children to the higher 
institutions. 
In addition to the secondary schools receiving grants from the 
board of education, there are private schools of this grade recognized 
as efficient, which invite inspection but do not wish to conform to the 
requirements for grants. Altogether there are about 1,000 secondary 
schools in England, with an enrollment of 179,000 pupils, in relation 
with the board of education. The statistics for Wales, in which the 
arrangements are slightly different from those in England, would 
increase the number of schools to 1,115 and the number of pupils to 
185,000. 
It should be noted, however, that the majority of private schools 
(the number is estimated at 14,000) do not come within this system at 
all. In a measure the work of these schools is systematized by the 
university examinations for individual pupils and for schools. 
The great endowed schools occupy a place in the English system 
quite distinct from that of other private schools. The former have 
always maintained close relations with Oxford and Cambridge and 
form, as it were, the preparatory stage in a complete scheme of liberal 
and professional education. 
BOY SCOUT MOVEMENT. 
The record of the year would be incomplete without reference to 
the educational features of the Boy Scout movement in England. 
This aspect of the subject was dwelt upon in a recent article, from 
which the following particulars are cited: 
The scout movement picks up a boy’s teaching just at that moment in his life when 
knowledge counts for something more than the bookishness to which he has been sub- 
jected. First of all, there is character training, to bring out perseverence, hardihood, 
pluck, and skill; when the boy is taught how to get and keep himself fit, how to assist 
his fellows in times of emergency and otherwise, how successfully to pursue some art 
er craft, how to be ready to turn his hand to anything from cooking a hunter’s stew to 
fellinga tree. In this connection Sir Robert Baden Powell has stated that ‘‘I am very 
anxious to extend the development of handicrafts among the scouts in all points of the 
country.”
-P-A-G-E-725
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 689 
In accordance with this purpose of the founder of the organization, 
increasing attention is given to the making of craftsmen, and the list 
of subjects for which badges of efficiency are awarded is declared to be 
“formidable.” The list already numbers no less than 52 handicrafts 
which call for careful attention and a satisfactory examination before 
the young scout can secure a “proficiency badge.’ It is not sur- 
prising, says the author of the article referred to— 
that employers have also begun to realize the value of the scout training and to look 
out for boys who have gone through it. The trustworthiness, the alertness of mind, 
the handiness and resource of the scout are qualities worth coveting and worth paying 
for.! 
TRADE AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
In England, as in the United States, the subject of vocational 
training engages serious attention at the present time. It is recog- 
nized in England that the agencies for this work must be adapted to 
the industrial, social, and political conditions of the country. At the 
same time every disposition is shown to profit by the experience of 
other countries which have had longer experience in this field. 
During the year an investigation of trade and technical education 
was conducted in France and Germany by Mr. J. C. Smail, repre- 
senting the London County Council. This gentleman, who is the 
organizer of the trade schools for boys in the London system, was 
accompanied by an officer of experience from the department of agri- 
cultural and technical instruction, Ireland. The report of this 
investigation deals largely with details relative to the work in the cities 
visited. Its value to Americans lies chiefly in the comparative esti- 
mate of systems on the part of its authors. 
The different ideals that direct the work in France, Germany, and 
Great Britain are contrasted in the report as follows: 
Germany aims at the building up of a great industrial nation partly by the thorough 
training of the leaders as experts, partly by the training of the middle-grade workers, 
such as draftsmen and foremen, as thoroughly accurate and careful managers, and 
partly by the training of all grades of workmen and mechanics as skilled craftsmen and 
good citizens. 
France aims at industrial excellence partly by the training of highly skilled experts 
and partly by the training of those who should become the best workmen and the best 
foremen. 5 
Britain aims at individual excellence partly by offering many avenues of training 
and many chances for willing and persevering workers to climb all sections of the 
industrial ladder. 
Each of these aims contains much good; no one of them is complete. Britain, by 
reason of its exceptional advantages, makes the most strenuous call upon its individuals 
for the advancement possible for them. 
It is necessary to bear these ideals in mind in considering any organization for 
technical education, for while these ideals have probably not been expressed, their

influence has undoubtedly been behind the progress made. The German ideal may 
be termed the long view which must eventually lead the German nation to and main- 
tain it in a foremost place as an industrial world power. The British method may be 
regarded as more philanthropic than patriotic; the ideal is admirable, but the bulk of 
the nation’s workers are not catered for by this ideal, and on the bulk of the workers 
much of the material prosperity of a nation must depend. 
The three countries named are alike in distinguishing between three 
main groups for whom vocational education must be provided. 
These groups are characterized as follows: 
(I) Lower or junior technical education for those with an elementaryeducation only, 
engaged in or about to be engaged in trades, of ages from 14 to 18—to train capable 
workmen. 
(II) Middle technical education for those with a more advanced general education, 
or for those who have already had some trade or workshop experience, of ages from 16 
upwards—to train draftsmen, designers, foremen, managers, etc. 
(III) Higher technical education for those with a thorough secondary education, 
or its equivalent, of ages from 18 upward—to train technical experts. 
It is explained that little attention was paid to the third group, 
because this has been repeatedly made prominent. With regard to 
the first and second groups the following general observation is made: 
The great development of voluntary evening technical instruction in Britain, which 
may be classed largely as middle, but partly as lower technical education, finds no 
adequate parallel in the systems of France and Germany. A considerable amount of 
work of this kind is going on, but the French and German educational experts do not 
appear to realize its possibilities, or perhaps too strongly realize its limitations. They 
accordingly look to day work as the only adequate method for imparting instruction of 
any real value and do not regard evening training as a practicable scheme by which 
individuals can gain such additional knowledge and training as will lead to their 
advancement from a lower to a higher grade on the industrial ladder. There is, 
however, evidence of a growing demand for this type of instruction in Paris and in 
Munich. 
Under the head of general conclusions the report emphasizes the 
importance of compulsory continuation schools for all youths from 
14 to 17 or 18 years of age, and the opinion is expressed that, so far 
as possible, day training schools must form a feature of the provision 
for trade training. 
It should not be inferred that England is indifferent to the increas- 
ing demand for trade and technical training, but following the usual 
custom of the country, local action precedes any endeavor to system- 
atize the work through the agency of the General Government. 
The present activities in this direction in that country can only be 
illustrated by reference to particular communities. 
The city of London affords large and varied opportunities by which 
workmen can improve their skill and technical knowledge; although 
this is chiefly provided by evening classes, many day schools have 
been organized for the same purpose, and their number is increasing. 
According to the latest reports the council maintains 17 technical 
institutions, schools of art, and day trade schools, and extends aid to
-P-A-G-E-727
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES, 691 
86 additional institutions, including 9 polytechnics, 4 domestic 
economy schools, and 2 higher institutions, namely, the Imperial 
College of Science and Technology and the technical classes of 
University College. The evening classes in these various institutions 
registered in 1912 about 35,000 students, whereas, there were less than 
4,000 in day classes. In addition to the appropriations made directly 
to these institutions, the council extends help to the students them- 
selves in the form of scholarships. The trade scholarships for boys 
generally consist of free education and a maintenance allowance of 
£6 ($30) and £15 ($75) for the second and third years. The scholar- 
ships awarded for girls are for such trades as dressmaking, laundry 
work, upholstery, etc. As a rule these scholarships are for a period 
of two years, and, in addition to free education, allow £8 as a main- 
tenance grant for the first year and £12 for the second. Attention 
is called to the importance of the consultative committees, which are 
the medium of relations between the trade schools and the tradeg 
themselves. On these committees the masters’ associations, the 
workmen’s associations, and the council are all represented. 
The measures by which provision for the day training of young 
employees is taking place in England are illustrated by. particulars 
pertaining to day classes for brass workers recently established in the 
city of Birmingham. 
Both the workmen and the employers in the brass trades—tho 
most important of the industries of this city—have shown a pro- 
gressive spirit in all their relations. This is illustrated by the 
agreement between the employers and the brass workers’ society 
for ascale of wages based upon the capacity of the workman, a graded 
scheme having been established which was first reported on October 
17, 1910. 
The agreement between employers and employed, as subsequently adopted, pro- 
vides that: 
1. The classes shall be held during the daytime from the hours of 8 to 12.30, and 2.30 
to 6, and be confined to boys in the brass and allied trades. 
2. Each pupil shall attend two half days per week. 
3. The school shall be opened each day of the week (Monday to Friday) in order 
that only a few boys may be absent at a time (say, one-fifth). 
4. It shall be available for all boys from 14 to 16 years of age. In the beginning a 
full two years’ course for boys starting under the age of 16 years may be given by 
arrangement. 
5. The wages of boys shall be paid by the employers and the brass workers’ society in 
certain proportions. The secretary of the brass workers’ society has stated that he 
would be responsible for a‘ maximum contribution of £25 ($122) per annum. 
6. The school authorities shall find teachers (whole-time teachers as far as possible), 
buildings, tools, and equipment, and also have the approving of the curriculum, 
the trade to find trade materials, models, and to assist in maintaining attendance 
and interest in the school. 
7. The majority of the management committee shall consist of representatives pro- 
posed by the manufacturers and workmen in the brass and allied trades, subject to 
confirmation by the education authority. 
8. The evening class at the technical school shall be continued, with a view to its 
becoming an advanced class for adults.  
-P-A-G-E-728
  692 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Firms interested in the brass trades have agreed to guarantee a total number of 105 
boys to attend these classes. 
The most important feature of the scheme is the contribution by employers and by 
the brass workers’ society toward the wages of the boys during the period of their 
instruction in the daytime.!

SCOTLAND. 
SCOPE OF THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. 
Universal provision for elementary education has so long existed 
in Scotland, and its importance is so generally recognized, that prog- 
ress is marked only by extensions and adaptations of the system. 
Education acts in Scotland have comprehensive scope in decided 
contrast with the piecemeal legislation of England. The latter pro- 
ceeds by filling up gaps when they threaten disaster; the former 
builds on the solid foundation of the act of 1872,which preserved the 
old parish and burgh system. The parish school fitted its foremost 
pupils for the university, and the burgh school added to this func- 
tion that of preparing young men for business careers. The educa-. 
tion act of 1872 maintained the best features of both by a compulsory 
clause, uniform for the entire country, and by distinct recognition 
of the existing secondary schools. Subsequent experience has shown 
the need of areas of school administration larger than the parish, 
while the complex demands of modern life call for new agencies of 
secondary education. The education act of 1908 extended the scope 
of school board activities, but left the parish areas as they were. At 
the same time, it provided for the increase and wider adaptations of 
the agencies of secondary education. The additional duties placed 
upon school boards by the act of 1908 emphasize the need of areas 
of local administration wider than the parishes, and as this is a 
matter affecting also the tenure and pecuniary support of teachers, 
it continues to be the end toward which efforts at new school legis- 
lation are mainly directed. These efforts, however, have had no

definite outcome during the present year. The only measure before 
Parliament affecting education in Scotland was the finance bill, 
emanating from the chancellor of the exchequer, which carried addi- 
tional grants for education in both England and Scotland. The 
extra grant available in Scotland for the four months ending Decem- 
ber 31, 1914, amounts to £71,000 ($355,000).

WELFARE ACTIVITIES. 
The welfare activities of the local school authorities include pro- 
vision for medical school inspection, for feeding necessitous school 
children, and for the vocational guidance of the young. In respect 
to these activities Scotland is affording lessons of great value to 
other countries. The second report on medical inspection issued by 
the department shows that the service is now organized throughout 
Scotland and is generally coordinated with the public health service. 
In view of exigencies arising from the European war, the depart- 
ment has issued a special circular to school boards, calling their 
attention to the extensive relief powers conferred upon them by the 
recent measure and urging that the boards, “while taking all due 
precautions against waste and needless expenditure, will make a 
liberal use of their powers under the act to meet all cases of genuine 
distress.” 
The letter further advises that school boards should work in this 
matter in close relations with all committees and public bodies 
dealing with problems of unemployment and distress in their respec- 
tive areas. 
EDINBURGH SCHEME FOR DEALING WITH CHILD NEGLECT AND 
CHILD RELIEF. 
The duties which a school board may undertake in dealing with 
cases of child neglect and necessity may be seen from the scheme 
formulated by the school board of Edinburgh. The population of   
1 Total net ordinary expenditure (excluding capital outlay) for 1911-12.
-P-A-G-E-730
  694 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
the city is 320,318, exceeded only by that of Glasgow, namely, 
775,594. With the exception of the latter, Edinburgh has to deal 
with more poverty than any other city in this division of Great 
Britain, and therefore requires a more complex scheme of relief 
operations than many. The plan adopted is applicable in all cities 
having similar conditions, and in respect to scope and method is 
suggestive for even smaller communities. Its main features are as 
follows: 
The scheme is divided into two main sections: (a) Child neglect, (6) child relief. 
As regards the former, there are seven types under which neglect is classified, viz, 
insufficient food, insufficient boots, insufficient clothing, neglect of medical treatment, 
vermin of head, vermin of body, and condition of dirt. For each of these types there 
is a procedure which has the following steps: White card of first warning, red card of 
second warning, certificate of neglect to the board, statutory notice to the parents 
and summons to the board, transmission of case to the procurator fiscal for prosecution. 
The white and red cards are issued by the head master to the parent; the certificate _ 
of neglect is signed by the head master and medical officer; and the neglectful parent, 
when summoned before the board, is given an opportunity of explaining the circum- 
stances of the neglect. 
During the year 1912-13 the number of statutory notices served upon parents 
(under section 6 of the act) for the various forms of child neglect was as follows:

Twenty-one parents were summoned before the board. In one case the parent 
was convicted at the sheriff court, and a penalty of 20s. or ten days’ imprisonment 
was imposed. 
In respect to the success of the system the Edinburgh school 
board received a series of reports from head masters, which are 
summarized as follows: 
(1) That the card system has had most beneficial effects in improving the condition 
of neglected children and in enforcing parental responsibility for neglect. 
(2) That the system of inquiry by which the cases of culpable neglect are separated 
from those of real destitution has been thorough and effective. 
(3) That the arrangements made for the supply of meals from the cooking cen- 
ter have been very satisfactory, both as regards quality of food and method of 
distribution. 
(4) That a real improvement in the condition of the children fed has been noted 
and a correspondingly increased aptitude for school work. 
(5) That the educational effect of eating meals under supervision and in satisfactory 
surroundings has been marked. 
(6) That the machinery of inquiry into cases of neglect and of earollment on the 
feeding list is somewhat slow.
-P-A-G-E-731
EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND, 695 
Commenting upon the opinions, the board in its official report 
says: 
The question of accelerating the system of inquiry is under careful consideraticn; 
but it must be borne in mind that a more rapid method of investigation might be less 
thorough and might fail in uniformity of treatment. 
Reference in some of the reports is made to the fact. that parents decline to fill 
up the schedule of application, though the children obviously require food, and the 
inference is that nothing more can be done. This is an entirely wrong conclusion. 
Cases such as these are exactly the cases for the penal side of the board’s procedure, 
and head masters should have no hesitation in so dealing with them. The act is 
explicit on the point, and it does not even lie in the option of the board to ignore cases 
of the type in question. It is hoped that all concerned will realize this aspect of the 
> duty of the education authority and take steps accordingly. 
LINK BETWEEN ELEMENTARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The relations long existing between the parish schools and the 
universities of Scotland prevented the general establishment of 
schools intermediate between the two and threw upon the universities 
a great deal of preparatory work which could not be satisfactorily 
accomplished in the parish schools. While England was rich in 
endowments for secondary education, endowments in Scotland 
prior to 1872 went chiefly to elementary education or to the uni- 
versities. Under the impulse of the education act of 1872 elementary 
schools became more and more differentiated from the higher educa- 
tion, while at the same time the universities were forced to abandon 
preparatory work. The Scotch authorities have been obliged, 
therefore, to create agencies for intermediate education and link 
them to the elementary schools on the one side and to the univer-. 
sities on the other. 
FUNDS FOR ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
The Edinburgh Merchant Company were pioneers in the field of 
secondary education. An attempt was made to turn other agencies 
in the same direction by the endowed institutions act of 1878. This 
act, however, which was permissive merely, had little effect upon 
the managers of trust funds, and hence it was followed in 1882 by 
the educational endowment act under which commissioners were 
appointed to inquire into the management of all educational endow- 
ments in Scotland, excepting those given after 1872, or those belong- 
ing to the universities or to theological institutions. The com- 
missioners were also authorized to draw up schemes for the future 
administration of the endowments falling within their inquiry and 
to pass upon schemes submitted by governing bodies. The gross 
income of the endowments dealt with by provisional orders and 
schemes under the act of 1882 is about £184,000 ($920,000) yearly. 
   
-P-A-G-E-732
  696 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
In most cases the endowments pertain to very limited areas. Three 
endowments applicable over wider areas—namely, the Dick, Milne, 
and Ferguson bequests—together with two others, limited in their 
geographical range—namely, the Highlands and Islands Educational 
Trust and the Heriot Trust, Edinburgh—have been applied directly 
to purposes of secondary education. 
The education and local taxation act of 1892 added £60,000 
($300,000) to the funds available in Scotland for promoting secondary 
education. Meanwhile the education department instituted a 
leaving-certificate examination (1888) which, in combination with 
the inspection service instituted by the department (1885), fixed a 
standard for secondary education. The certificate was accepted 
by the universities in place of their entrance examinations, and thus 
it formed a link between them and the secondary schools. The 
intermediate certificate offered subsequently has in like manner 
served to define the character of a briefer course of instruction for 
pupils entering early into business life or intending to follow special- 
jzed technical courses. 
THE CARNEGIE TRUST. 
The twelfth annual report of the Carnegie Trust for the universi- 
ties of Scotland presents a review of the operations of the fund, which 
is conducted on a larger scale than any other scheme for the endow- 
ment of higher education and research in that country. The follow- 
ing statements are from a review of the report in a contemporary 
journal: 
The annual income of the trust amounts to rather more than £100,000, and after 
defraying the expenses of administration there is left about £99,000 as the net revenue 
available for distribution under the two main heads of the scheme. Half of this 
sum is earmarked annually for the payment of students’ fees, while the other moiety 
is devoted (a) to the better equipment of the Scottish universities and colleges by 
the foundation of additional chairs and lectureships and by the provision of new 
laboratories and permanent equipment, and (6) to the endowment of research. Of 
course the equipment section of the expenditure also plays its part in the advance- 
ment of research work, as it furnishes places in which investigations can be carried 
on and also helps to provide posts for men who become directors of research in their 
various departments. It will be seen that the operations of the trustees are finan- 
cially on a grand scale; for the funds at their disposal annually represent a sum 
equivalent to about 60 per cent of the total Government grant in support of the higher 
educational institutions in England and Wales. 
In the allocation of the funds the trustees have been guided by two main considera- 
tions: First, they decided that their assistance to the four universities and their 
kindred colleges should be given under a quinquennial scheme, so that each step 
forward has been based upon the allocation of approximately helf a million sterling. 
Secondly, a general rule was laid down that the trust would not hamper its income 
by paying salaries for new posts year by year out of the annual revenue, but instead 
any new chair or lectureship is endowed fully at the start, so that its subsequent
-P-A-G-E-733
“EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 697 ° 
career entails no further draft upon the funds of the trustees. In this way each chairon 
its foundation disappears from the books of the trust, and the next quinquennial 
distribution can be devoted to entirely fresh needs. 
Through the agency of this fund, striking progress has been made 
in the provision of new laboratories and apartments as well as in the 
increase of the professor staffs. Not less striking is the arrangement 
made for the endowment of research and postgraduate study. In 
regard to this feature of the administration the article continues: 
A system of scholarships and fellowships has been founded which is supplemented 
by a series of grants in aid of research to Scottish graduates resident in Scotland; and 
this part of the trust’s work has been of equal, if not greater, importance to the Scot- 
tish university system. Thus from the time a student enters the university to the 
day he leaves Scotland he finds a helping hand extended to him should he wish to 
grasp it. 
During his undergraduate career he may obtain payment of his university fees; 
later, he may aspire to carry out researches, in which case he may apply for a scholar- 
ship or a fellowship. The research scholarships are conferred upon students on the 
recommendation of experts—usually the persons under whom the beginner in research 
will have to take his first steps in original work. Research fellowships are meant for 
men who have already accomplished something, and they are allocated on the merits 
of the work which the candidate has already published. In neither case is there any 
competitive examination, nor do the trustees bind themselves to furnish a fixed num- 
ber of scholarships or fellowships in a given year. This is one of the most desirable 
features of their policy; for, as any teacher knows, an institution may turn out, say 20 
first-class men in a given year, while in the following year only 1 or 2 may appear, so 
that the granting of a fixed number of scholarships per annum simply means that in 
some years a first-class man may not secure an appointment toa scholarship which in 
the following year will fall to the lot of a much inferior man, owing to there being a 
dearth in candidates. It should be pointed out that the trustees retain all these ap- 
pointments in their own hands, so that graduates of all the four universities are dealt 
with on equal terms. The scholarships are of the value of £100 per annum, and are 
tenable for one year with a possibility of extension or of the holder’s promotion to a 
fellowship; the fellowships are of the value of £150 per annum, and are normally ten- 
able for two years, though further renewals are possible. 
The impetus given to research under this plan is illustrated by the 
outcome in a single science, that of chemistry. It is stated that: 
In the eight years, 1903-1911, the trust appointed in this department 45 scholars, 
25 fellows, and 31 graduates. The work of these has resulted in the publication of 
more than 130 original communications to scientific journals. Now, in 1912, the con- 
tributions of the whole British chemical world to the Transactions of the Chemical So- 
ciety amounted to only double this number, 266; so that it is evident that the Carnegie 
Trust, by its encouragement of research, has indirectly in the course of eight years 
produced a series of results equal to half the annual output of the whole Empire at 
the present time. This, it must be remembered, represents only a single department 
of the trust’s activities. 
In conclusion the writer emphasizes the wisdom of the Carnegie 
trustees in laying down general rules which allow great flexibility 
and thought to the narrowing phases of rigid requirements.

IRELAND. 
THE SYSTEM OF NATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
The development of the system of education in Ireland, in common 
with that of other public affairs, has been hindered by the contest over 
the home rule bill and the expectation of a radical change in local 
administration according,to the issue of that contest. Meanwhile, 
however, the report of the commissioners of national education, who 
control the disbursement of public funds for elementary education, 
shows progress in many respects, although the absolute attendance 
upon the schools has somewhat diminished. The following statis- 
tics show fluctuations in attendance, which arise partly from improve- 
ments in the statistical method:

The national schools are chiefly denominational, but Protes- 
tants may attend Catholic schools, and vice versa, in case parents 
make no objection. The distribution of the pupils by religious de- 
nominations in 1912 was as follows:

  The early withdrawal of children from school is a special difficulty 
with which the managers have to contend. According to statistics 
showing the distribution of pupils by age, over two-thirds (68.4 per 
cent) were between the ages of 3 and 11. The number under 6 years 
of age was 15 per cent of the total. It is noticeable further that 70 
per cent of the enrolled pupils were in the first three standards or 
grades.

The teaching force employed in the schools in 1912 was composed 
as follows: Principal teachers, 7,816; assistants, 5,398; workmistresses 
and junior assistant teachers, 2,490. 
For the professional preparation of teachers there were seven 
training colleges with 1,160 students in 1912-13. The increase of 
evening schools is noticeable; in 1912-13 there were 323 in operation. 
The sums expended from Parliamentary grants and rates (local 
taxes) for the support of the schools were as follows for the years

  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
Secondary education in Ireland has been promoted through the 
agency of the intermediate education board, which disburses grants 
to schools on the basis of the number of pupils who successfully pass 
the examinations of the board. In 1912, students numbering 12,581 
(8,276 boys and 4,305 girls) presented themselves for examination, as 
compared with 12,105 in the previous year, and 8,117 in 1901. Tho 
number passed in 1912 was 7,015 (4,767 boys and 2,248 girls). In 
the last year named the grant in respect of examinations paid to 
managers of schools amounted to £50,198 ($243,962.28), besides 
prizes and bonuses to schools. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Technical education in Ireland is controlled by the Department of 
Agriculture and Technical Instruction, with the advice of a technical 
instruction board and a consultative committee. 
The department endeavors to coordinate its work with that of other 
educational authorities; in 1911-12 grants from the Parliamentary 
appropriation were paid by the department as follows:

Central institutions under the department are the Royal College 
of Science, Dublin, with 141 students (1911-12); the Metropolitan 
School of Art, with 371 pupils (1911-12); the Irish Training School of 
Domestic Economy, 29 students; the Killarney School of Housewifery, 
45 students. 
According to the latest report of the operations of this department— 
Technical instruction throughout Ireland is organized under the councils of county 
boroughs, urban districts, and counties. In urban and county schools and classes 
(1911-12) there were 45,502 young men and women studying nonagricultural subjects. 
In local examinations 365 candidates entered for science subjects, and 203 passed; 
2,634 entered in art, and 1,257 passed (1912). There is an annual grant (out of the 
department’s annual endowment fund) of £55,000 for technical education, of which 
£26,000 is allotted for technical instruction in county boroughs and £29,000 for similar 
and related purposeselsewhere. A grant of £7,000, called the ‘‘equivalent grant,” was 
made from the Ireland development grant for technical instruction, and a grant of , 
£10,500 for manual instruction and domestic economy in rural districts, and £3,000 
for classes in lace and crochet-making and other rural industries, was made by the 
agricultural board in 1911-12,

COMMON CHARACTERISTICS. 
The Scandinavian countries—Sweden, Norway, and Denmark— 
show in their school administration the signs of a common origin. 
In all three countries the Central Government exercises supreme 
control over this interest through a department or ministry of public 
instruction and ecclesiastical affairs, civil and religious authorities 
participating alike in this function. 
The established or State church in the three Kingdoms is the 
Lutheran. Full liberty of conscience is allowed, however, and the 
State has no monopoly of education. Private schools, both denomi- 
national and secular, flourish, especially in the large cities. In the 
three Kingdoms public elementary education is gratuitous and 
attendance either at public or equivalent schools compulsory for all 
children 7 to 14 years of age. 
The compulsory provisions are so thoroughly carried out and 
accord so entirely with the disposition of the people that illiteracy 
is practically obliterated from the Scandinavian countries. Accord+ 
ing to the latest statistics, the enrollment in elementary schools, 
either public or under public supervision, equals about 15 per cent 
of the population in each of the three Kingdoms considered. Den- 
mark has an excellent system of continuation schools, and similar, 
though less extended, systems have developed in Sweden and Nor- 
way. The secondary schools are under public supervision and 
largely maintained by the State or towns, so that while not entirely 
gratuitous, tuition fees are small. People’s high schools, which 
701  
-P-A-G-E-738

originated in Denmark, are maintained also in Sweden and in a 
modified form in Norway. 
The registration of students in Scandinavian universities in 1912-13 
was as follows: Sweden—State universities: Upsala, 2,419 students; 
Lund, 1,137; Stockholm (State medical faculty), 352. Private Uni- 
versity of Stockholm, 6,157; Goteborg (philosophical faculty), 235. 
Norway: University of Christiania, 1,500 students. Denmark: 
University of Copenhagen and the Polytechnic Institute, about 
4,000. 
SWEDEN. 
[Report of the Royal Committee on Elementary Education.] 
In 1906 a royal committee was appointed by the Swedish Gov- 
ernment to investigate the status of training colleges for elementary- 
school teachers and to make recommendations for their improve- 
ment. The public discussions of the work of this committee, as it 
proceeded, indicated very clearly the importance of extending the 
scope of the investigation to elementary schools themselves. Ac- 
cordingly, the number of members was increased by the addition of 
several persons of large experience in the conduct of such schools 
and the practical conditions which they must meet. In 1911 the 
committee published a voluminous report, treating of training col- 
leges for teachers, and a little later two other reports, dealing with 
the matter of supervisory boards and school inspectors. On the 
basis of these reports three Government bills were laid before the 
Riksdag in 1913.1 
The final report of the committee on elementary schools, issued 
during the current year, deals specially with the question of reforms 
required in the folkskola (primary school) and its extension by 
means of the continuation school. The main points of the report are 
as follows:? 
FOLKSKOLA. 
The attention of the committee was directed chiefly to the unsatis- 
factory condition of the elementary schools (folkskolor) in the rural 
districts, in which about 40 per cent of the children of the country 
receive their entire education. The defects of these schools are due 
chiefly to the brief school term and the number of very small schools 
in poor districts having few inhabitants. The only remedy for these 
evils, in the opinion of the committee, would be special State appro- 
priations for increasing the salaries of teachers and putting the 
schools generally upon a better basis. Mere changes in the school 
regulations and the organization of schools will not reach the evils.

EDUCATION IN SWEDEN, 703 
In regard to the general organization of the elementary schools, 
the committee recommends that a normal plan of study be adopted 
arranged for a course of seven years; that education should be com- 
pulsory for every child up to the close of the thirteenth year of age; 
that distinction be made in the school regulations between the 
obligatory subjects of instruction common to all schools and addi- 
tional subjects that may be sanctioned. 
The plan of instruction submitted by the committee is more exten- 
sive and more varied than that in use, but is intended to require 
less memorizing and dependence upon textbooks. The plan pro- 
vides for the correlation of subjects such as geography and natural 
science in a manner more interesting to the young mind than the 
original grouping has been. For the first three years, these subjects 
are comprised under the heading ‘‘hembygdskunskap” (knowledge 
of one’s own surroundings), set lessons in these subjects to be de- 
ferred to the fourth year of the course. The relation between geogra- 
phy and natural science is continued in the upper classes, and the 
teacher is advised to let the two subjects come alternately, so as to be 
mutually helpful. 
In the general plan of instruction larger place is given to hygiene, 
in order that the school may, at an earlier stage than heretofore, 
assist the child in forming healthful habits. Formal instruction in the 
subject is assigned to the sixth year of the course. Special emphasis 
is laid on the need of instructing children as to the nature and effects 
of alcoholic liquors, the harmful effects of tobacco, etc. The com- 
mittee also recommends that appropriations be made for promoting 
gymnastics in the country schools and that time be given for games 
and athletic events. The courses in religion are modified in such a 
way as to make the text of the Bible itself the foundation of early 
instruction, the teaching of the catechism being deferred to the last 
two years of the school course. 
CONTINUATION SCHOOL. 
In the opinion of the committee, the system of public instruction 
in Sweden has not kept pace with tho requirements of the economic 
and social development of the last four decades. The elementary 
school, they say, hardly reaches the ‘‘upper limit of childhood.” It 
should be extended by a school adapted to the large majority of 
pupils who, on leaving the elementary school, must devote them- 
selves to earning a livelihood. For such pupils a continuation school 
is necessary, which offers opportunity for instruction at certain 
periods of the year or at certain hours during the week, the rest of 
the time being given by the pupils to their employment. In order 
that this continuation school should be effective, it must be practical 
in aim and attendance upon it obligatory. The school should keep  
-P-A-G-E-740
a i 
704 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
in view the practical work in which the pupils are employed, or which 
is to be their future life calling, and should make this work as far 
as possible the center of its instruction; at the same time, it must be 
considered that the main end of the instruction is to “further the 
moral and mental development of the pupils and make them useful 
members of society.” 
The report emphasizes the fact that the continuation school is 
not to be a trade school in the ordinary sense, but a school which 
adopts the point of view of the trade in its instruction. This instruc- 
tion, it is said, should be “partly theoretical instruction about the 
trade; partly practical instruction in the trade.’ It is recognized, 
however, that the practical instruction can only be given when the 
school is ‘‘provided with a workshop, well arranged and equipped.” 
In preparation for a continuation school of this order, a six-year 
folkskola would suffice. 
Plans and details are given by the committee for different types 
of continuation schools; namely, schools for agricultural communi- 
ties, industrial schools in connection with the iron industry, timber 
industry, and textile industry, and continuation schools for young 
women, giving instruction in home economics, in sewing, and com- 
mercial branches. As subjects common to all continuation schools, 
the committee recommends “knowledge of industry” (arbetskun- 
skap), civil government, hygiene, and mother tongue. Of these, 
arbetskunskap is ‘‘the central subject, which gathers material from 
every side according to the nature of the practical work which is the 
object of instruction.” Where no opposition is made, instruction in 
religion should occupy a part of the time. 
In regard to the teachers of continuation schools, it is recognized 
that these will be drawn from the staff of the “folkskolor,”’ but for 
the subject arbetskunskap there should be “specially trained men.” 
In the opinion of the committee, courses for training such teachers 
should be maintained by the State.” 
As a rule, details regarding the continuation schools must be left 
to local school boards, but the committee recommends that the 
obligatory course shall include 360 hours of instruction; that the 
local authorities have the right to extend the time to a maximum 
of 540 hours; that the courses shall extend over two or three years; 
and that the minimum remuneration for a teacher shall be 2 crowns 
(53.6 cents) for each hour of service, the same to be paid by the 
State.

INVESTIGATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Following the precedent set by Sweden, the Government of Norway 
is considering measures looking to the reorganization of the public- 
school system, and as a preliminary has arranged for the investigation

of the public schools of foreign countries which, it is thought, may 
afford useful suggestions for guidance in this work. The present 
system is characterized by its special adaptations to local conditions; 
emphasis is placed in the schools upon the exercises and studies which 
promote manual skill and interest in the local environment and in- 
dustries. The need, however, of a broader education for the teachers 
of elementary schools and of more extended instruction, especially 
for the rural population, is recognized. 
THE SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION.! 
The existing system of agricultural education comprises a central 
institution and local schools. The former is the State Agricultural 
Academy at Aas, which was established in 1856 and organized in its 
present form in accordance with a law of May 22, 1897. 
THE STATE AGRICULTURAL ACADEMY. 
The aim of this institution, as stated in the law, is— 
to impart knowledge based on scientific principles for the training of agriculturists, 
silviculturists, allotters, and dairyists, as also to further scientific research in the 
fields which the academy covers. 
The academy is organized in two classes: 
(a) A common class of one year. 
(6) A vocational class, divided in the following departments: 
(1) The agricultural department, one year. 
(2) Department of allotment, one year. 
(3) Gardening, one year. 
(4) Dairying, one year. 
(5) Silviculture, two years. 
In the common class the instruction begins in the middle of August and closes June 
20 of the following year. It comprises mathematics, surveying, physics and meteor- 
ology, chemistry, mineralogy and geology, botany, zoology, study of soils, drawing, 
bookkeeping, national economy, and, for silviculturists and gardeners, silviculture 
and gardening. 
  The vocational classes include the subjects common to all branches 
of agriculture, with specialties according to the particular depart- 
ment, 
THE LOCAL (AMT) AGRICULTURAL SCHOO 
  In addition to the agricultural academy there are numerous local 
agricultural schools maintained by the amts (counties) with aid from 
the State. The first local school of this character was founded in 
1825, and the number has been steadily increasing; at the present 
time 17 of the 20 amts have one or more such institutions. They are 
conducted on the same general plan, under the supervision of the   
   1 Particulars derived from Det offentlige landbruksvaesen i Norge indtil 1914, by @. Tandberg, the direc- 
tor of agricultural education, published by Grgndahl & Sons, Christiania, 1914.

department of agriculture; the course of instruction covers one and 
one-half to two years, including practical work on the school farm, 
which is supplied by the district. The recent investigation showed 
‘that many of these schools were in a very unsatisfactory condition, 
and it is proposed that the amount of the State aid shall be increased 
and the schools brought under closer supervision and conducted in a 
more systematic manner and with greater regard to the \relation 
between scientific knowledge and its practical application to farm 
work. 
A recent departure in this local provision is that of the ‘‘movablo 
agricultural schools” for small farmers. An example is the movablo 
school established in the Nordlands Amt in 1911, offering two three- 
months courses in selected places during the winter. Naturally in this 
case the instruction can not be supplemented by farm practice. 
Norway also has several important private agricultural schools, 
among thom a winter school at Christiania, and a similar one at 
@Mrsten, founded by the young people’s association of that town; both 
of these receive aid from the State. ‘ 
MOVABLE AGRICULTURAL COURSES. 
The subject of instruction for petty farmers was brought up for 
consideration in the budget of agriculture for 1912. In presenting 
the subject the minister said: 
The matter of prime importance is to arouse the interest of the farming population; 
especially to make the petty farmers realize that scientific knowledge is of importance 
for their work. And if this is to be successful, there is no other way than to bring the 
means of instruction to their very doors; the courses must be given in every community. 
It is the same method that has been used in other countries to awaken the interest of 
the petty farmer. 
  The following plan for this new departure was outlined by the 
department of agriculture: 
Movable agricultural courses are to be arranged with a program of instruction 
especially fitted for the small farmers. As teachers for these courses men are to be 
appointed who have received special training for this work. Teachers are provided 
with material, easily packed, consisting of such things as are in use: Plants, seed for 
sowing, seed of weeds, fertilizers, models, etc. 
With this outfit they travel about in winter, or, if there is enough demand, the entire 
year, from one community to another, and conduct courses in the schoolhouses. The. = 
length of the courses is adapted to the conditions in each place. To begin with, it™~ 
will probably be necessary to limit them to one or two weeks. The instruction is” 
given in the afternoon or evening three or four hours a day. 
A course is worked out which the teacher must follow, that the time may be well 
used and the instruction not become a matter of chance. The course must give some- 
thing of evident practicability; it must, in other words, come as near home to the 
work of the farmer as possible. At the same time it must arouse interest, so that the 
listeners shall desire to have the course continued and to extend their knowledge 
further. There must be the chance to choose between different subjects of instruc- 
tion according to conditions in the community in question, but the method of instruc-     
m
-P-A-G-E-743
  EDUCATION IN DENMARK, 707 
tion should be the same everywhere. The instruction must be methodical and well 
prepared, nothing left to chance. 
For free distribution at the courses small pamphlets are printed which discuss 
useful points for the small farmer. 
The courses are made known by means of posters, announcements, and course out- 
lines, which are sent a week or two in advance to the teachers in the common schools 
with the request that they be sent home with the children. These outlines should 
be illustrated by pictures giving an idea of what will be offered, and they must be made 
interesting, so that they may tempt the reader to apply for the course. 
Admission to the courses should be free for every man or woman who has anything 
to do with agriculture or with the side branches of agriculture. It is possible that in 
order to arouse the interest of the small farmer it will be necessary at first, just as in 
Switzerland, to offer stipends. 
The expenses should be divided between the State, the amt, and the communities 
in which the courses are held. Probably the community and the amt should offer 
an equal share and the State supply the rest. The fairest plan would be that the State 
handle three-fourths of the expenses, just as it does in the present instruction in agri- 
culture. 
Stress is placed on the excellence and the fitness of the teachers for their task, for 
on them depends to a marked degree whether or not the plan shall meet with success 
and the attempt show any good results. 
PREPARATION OF TEACHERS. 
It was urged by the department that in drafting a new plan of 
study for the agricultural academy, provision should be made for 
preparing teachers for the local agricultural schools and also for the 
_movable courses; in this connection the example of Denmark was 
referred to, and in view of the time that would be required to prepare 
the new teachers of agriculture it was advised that, for the present, 
the traveling teachers, before they begin their work in Norway, 
should have opportunity to study a few months at the Danish 
schools for cottagers or at the schools for small farmers in Sweden. 
The scheme thus presented was put into operation last year, 43 
courses of instruction having been offered; the attendance was good, 
in some places reaching 200, and the traveling teachers report that 
great interest had been manifested by the farmers and that tho in- 
struction had been extremely useful. 
The arrangement is regarded as temporary, and a proposition has 
been recently presented by the department of agriculture for estab- 
lishing a-special school to prepare teachers for the work of instructing 
petty farmers and for the gradual establishment of schools for 
farmers of this class. This motion is still pending in the Storthing. 
DENMARK. 
Denmark has become an object lesson to the world by reason of 
its system of rural education and its agricultural prosperity. Every 
nation recently awakened to the importance of the subject and to the 
dangers that threaten when rural populations are ignorant and shift-   
 
-P-A-G-E-744
  108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
less has turned to Denmark for direction in the effort at rural uplift. 
The United States, although later in the movement than European 
nations, is now alive to this necessity, and in its turn ready to profit 
by this example. Obviously, the subject can not be covered in the 
brief survey of the year, but it has been very fully treated in several 
bulletins published by. the bureau.t| The most recent of these deals 
with the Danish folk high school, which has had a wonderful effect in 
enabling rural communities to hold their own against urban influence. 
To quote the author: 
Strong churches and well-organized schools in charge of devoted and well-trained 
men who are giving their lives to the work in the open country lie there as permanent 
citadels against any outside aggression. * * * Pastors and teachers have their 
share in the remarkably effective extension work emanating from the folk high schools 
and local agricultural schools, 
These activities all belong to the period after the school life has 
finished, but the schools themselves have an equal bearing upon rural 
prosperity. They not only impart instruction in the elements, but 
they train ‘young men and women for a varied rural artisanship.” 
As a result of this fortunate combination of school training and 
community exercises, the entire rural population of Denmark have 
learned to take “the right outlook on life,” and are bearing the most 
important part in the “‘social economic evolution of the country.” 
HIGHER INSTITUTIONS, 
The veterinary and agricultural college at Copenhagen has played 
an important part in promoting the remarkable development of the 
agricultural and dairy industries of the Kingdom. The Polytechnic 
Institute, situated at the capital, has recently been installed in new 
buildings, thoroughly appointed for the various branches of technical 
education. The State contributes to its support an annual appro- 
priation of 345,000 kroner ($86,200). This institute maintains close 
relations with the university, many lectures and laboratory facilities 
being common to both. , 
The culture of Denmark centers in the University of Copenhagen, 
which from the time of its foundation, 1478, has exercised great 
influence upon the intellectual life of northern Europe. Students 
who have completed the course of the gymnasia are admitted to the 
university without examination. The studies of the first year are 
the same for all students and lead to the degree of candidate of 
philosophy. After the first year the students enter upon professional 
courses according to their choice. These courses vary in duration 
from the four or five years required for the degree of master of arts

or master of science to the seven or eight years required for the 
diploma of candidate in medicine. The university is supported by 
the income of its own funds and an annual appropriation from the 
State of about 900,000 kroner ($241,000). There are no tuition fees, 
but small charges for extras are made. Between three and four 
thousand students are in annual attendance at the university and the 
Polytechnic Institute. 
In addition to the influences that have raised rural life to such a 
high level in Denmark, there is a development in respect to ideal 
interests that is extending its influences to other nations. These two 
tendencies are characterized in a contemporary journal as follows: 
NATIONAL TENDENCIES, 
Two tendencies have been chiefly dominant for a long time in Danish intellectual 
and cultural life; one is represented by the movement inspired by Grundtvig, the 
other is Brandesianism. The movement represented and led by Brandes claims the 
honor of having introduced modern European intellectual and cultural life into 
Denmark, while the movement fostered by Grundtvig is, in its origin and subsequent 
development, intensely national. While the former, which arose in the seventies, is 
a cult of the intellect, Grundtvig’s movement aimed at satisfying man as man and 
above all the yearnings of the heart, both with respect to temporal and with respect to 
eternal concerns.' 
BELGIUM AND THE NETHERLANDS. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The calamity which has overtaken Belgium in the course of the 
European war and the refuge afforded the homeless people by the 
Netherlands recalls an important period in the history of the two 
nations. From 1815 to 1830 Belgium formed with Holland the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the influence of this union is still 
seen in many customs and institutions. The similarity of the edu- 
cational systems of the two countries is very noticeable. In both, 
communal and denominational authorities have had supreme control 
over elementary schools, although the respective Governments have 
borne a large part of the cost of the schools. Both countries have also 
been distinguished by their liberal provision for industrial education 
and for the general use of those facilities by the young people of the 
working classes. 
Ample support for higher education has also been characteristic 
of the two nations, while the distinction between the schools for the 
people and those attended by the wealthier classes has been less 
pronounced than in European countries generally.

BELGIUM. 
SYSTEM OF PRIMARY EDUCATION, 
The system of primary education in Belgium was originally or- 
ganized in accordance with the education law of 1842, which was 
abrogated by the law of 1879, passed during the temporary ascen- 
dency of the Liberal Party. In 1884 the Catholic Party having re- 
gained a majority in the legislature, a new school law was passed 
which returned to the conditions established in 1842. In accordance 
with this law primary schools were established and maintained by 
communal authorities, which were authorized also to subsidize paro- 
chial schools. The communal taxes for the support of the schools 
were supplemented by State and provincial appropriations. Normal 
schools for the professional preparation of teachers for primary 
schools were either State institutions or schools under private control 
approved by the State. 
The new school law, which went into effect in May, 1914, con- 
tinued the policies embodied in the law of 1884, but included a com- 
pulsory school-attendance clause, applicable to all children from the 
ages of 6 to 14, completed. 
At tho latest date reported (1912), the enrollment in the primary 
schools was 935,377, equivalent to 12.5 per cent of the population 
(estimated at 7,500,000); there were also 277,721 children under 6 
years of age in the infant schools (coles gardiennes) and 249,121 
pupils in the public classes for adults. 
THE FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. 
Tho General Federation of Belgian Teachers has long been re- 
garded as one of the most vigorous and progressive associations of 
the kind in Europe. In its session held in March, 1914, the associa- 
tion considered, particularly, the infant schools of the Kingdom. 
The condition of these schools in the smaller communes was severely 
criticized, buildings and equipment being miserable and classes 
overcrowded; in striking contrast were the infant schools in the large 
cities. These were characterized as veritable “school gardens,” 
provided with suitable buildings, ample courts and grounds, and 
conducted by teachers expert in the art of developing young children 
by means of plays and free activities. The federation placed itself 
on record in favor of the Froebelian system for infant schools, and 
urged the increase of provision for training teachers in this system. 
Attention was called to the fact that the normal school for women 
in the city of Brussels included a section for this special work, and 
classes in the system and methods of Froebel were maintained by the 
cities of Liege, Antwerp, and Ghent. Two provincial schools for the 
training of kindergarten teachers had also been established, one in 
the Province of Hainaut and a second in the Province of Brabant.

SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Belgium was one of the first nations to depart from the medieval 
system of higher education by the provision of two orders of sec- 
ondary schools. The higher class, of which the royal athénées were 
the type, prepared students for the universities and highest technical 
schools; they numbered 35 in 1912 (20 athénées, 15 colleges), with 
8,323 students. The lower class of secondary schools were intended 
to provide advanced instruction for students who did not expect to 
enter upon the higher professions; at the same time their studies 
were so arranged that students might pass from them to the upper 
classes of the athénées. The secondary schools of this order for 
boys numbered 90 in 1912, with 19,765 students. The corresponding 
schools for girls numbered 44, with 10,104 students. Professors of 
the higher orders of secondary education were as a rule university 
men, but four normal schools were maintained for the professional 
training of teachers for the lower secondary schools. Of these, two 
for men had 52 students in 1912, and two for women 157 students. 
The secondary schools were established by the State, by communes 
with the aid of the State, or were subsidized private institutions. 
Public appropriations for secondary education amounted in 1911 
to 6,888,157 francs ($1,377,631). Of this amount the State con- 
tributed 664 per cent, the communes 32% per cent, and the Provinces 
the small balance.* 
THE UNIVERSITIES OF BELGIUM 
The University of Louvain, which was destroyed August 2, 1914, 
was founded in 1426 by John IV, Duke of Brabant, and with the 
approbation of Pope Martin V.. It was for many centuries the only 
institution of higher education in the dukedom. It was suppressed 
in 1797, and during the Napoleonic era Belgium remained without 
universities. By a decree of September 25, 1816, a university was 
reestablished at Louvain; but it was not until December, 1835, that 
it was reorganized under the Episcopal Body of Belgium; since that 
date it has been one of the chief Roman Catholic universities of 
Europe. 
The development of the University of Louvain during the last half 
of the nineteenth century was marked by the organization of special 
schools and institutes, answering to modern requirements. Among 
these should be noted the philological institute and a school for 
instruction in the Scriptures and in oriental languages, both founded 
in 1844; the latter was the beginning of the oriental school that has 
since become famous. In 1864 there was established at the uni-

et du Congo Belge for 1913, published in 1914.

versity in connection with the faculty of sciences a school of civil 
engineering, industry, and mines; in 1878 a school for the training of 
agricultural engineers was added and the new anatomic institute, now 
widely known as the Vésale Institute. A few years later provision 
for the technical professions and pursuits was increased by the erec- 
tion of a micrographic institute, an institute of practical physics, a 
higher brewing school, and a laboratory of bacteriology; the last 
named has developed into a great institute. These extensions were 
soon followed by the founding of a chair of electro-technical instruc- 
tion, and in the faculty of philosophy and letters there was organized 
a course in moral and historical sciences leading to a special doctorate, 
and in the faculty of law a practical course in economic and social sci- 
ences. During this long period the standard of instruction in the 
older faculties was well maintained, and new chairs were founded 
from time to time, so that the University of Louvain offered very 
complete facilities for acquiring the learned and technical professions. 
The scholastic organization of this ancient university, as set forth 
in the Annuaire for 1914, included the following faculties: Theology, 
law, medicine, philosophy and letters, and faculty of sciences. Ad- 
juncts of the last-named faculty are special schools of arts and manu- 
factures, civil engineering and mines, and the agronomic institute. 
The school of commercial and consular sciences is not attached to 
any one of the faculties, but has its independent organization. Under 
the stimulating direction of special professors, the student body of 
the university is organized in several associations which promote good 
comradeship and intellectual pursuits. Among these is the society 
formed in the interests of the students of the Flemish districts, a 
philosophic society under the presidency of the rector of the uni- 
versity, a philological society, and a circle for the cultivation of French 
literature. 
In 1913 the university registered 2,870 students, distributed’ as 
follows:

The University of “Dunsseli: like that of Louvain, was of private 
origin and has remained free from State control. It was founded in 
1834 and has been maintained by private subscriptions. The facul- 
ties and special schools which the university comprised, with the 
distribution of students in the same in 1912 and in 1913, were as 
follows:

The two remaining universities of Belgium, namely, the University 
of Ghent and the University of Liege, are State institutions, both 
dating back to a decree issued in 1816 by King William I, Belgium 
being at the time part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Both 
institutions were reorganized in accordance with the law of 1835, 
passed directly after the separation of Belgium from Holland. The 
development of the two State universities has been marked by large 
provision for the exact sciences and by the establishment of auxiliary 
technical schools. At Ghent the development in practical instruction 
has related chiefly to the arts and manufactures characteristic of that 
region, to architecture and engineering; while at Liege special atten- 
tion has been given to mining engineering. The two universities have 
also been equipped for training professors for secondary schools, the 
faculty of sciences at Ghent having been utilized for the preparation 
of professors of sciences, and the faculty of philosophy and letters at 
Liege for the training of professors of the classic humanities. During 
the last decade of the nineteenth century the resources of the two 
State universities were greatly increased by the erection of new build- 
ings and their equipment for scientific and technical purposes. Ghent 
was provided with an experimental institute of applied mechanics, 
institutes of hygiene, of bacteriology, and of physiology, and an exten- 
sive garden for the use of the students of natural science. Large 
subsidies were also granted by the Government for the installation 
of the electrotechnical laboratory. In like manner Liege was sup- 
plied with a chemical institute, a clinical institute, fine building for 
the faculties of philosophy and letters and law, and extensions for 
the services of physics, hygiene, and the technical faculties. Through 
the munificence of a private benefactor, Mr. Montefiore, the university 
possesses an electrotechnical institute which is not only well installed 
but has received from its founder a capital of a million francs, the 
income to be used for the maintenance of the plant and the purchase 
of new apparatus.

THE NETHERLANDS. 
  Since the separation of Belgium from the Kingdom of the Nether- 
lands the latter name has been retained as the official designation of 
Holland. The Kingdom covers an area slightly exceeding that of 
Belgium, and like the latter is densely populated. According to the 
estimates of 1910, the total population of the Netherlands was 5,898,- 
429, and the density 466 inhabitants to a square mile. The colonial 
possessions form two groups covering altogether an area of 785,000 
square miles. The chief group is that of the East Indies, including 
the rich islands of Java and Sumatra. The second group comprises 
several small islands in the West Indies, the largest being Surinam 
and Curagao. 
Primary or popular education is provided by a State-aided system 
in which schools under private management, chiefly denominational, 
bear an important part. The public schools are established by the 
communes or in case of necessity by the Government. 
The Netherlands holds high place among European nations for 
the general diffusion of knowledge and the low degree of illiteracy. 
In 1900 the record of the army recruits showed 1.4 per cent of illit- 
erates; in 1912 this had fallen to 0.8 per cent. This improvement 
over a condition which already was very satisfactory is attributed 
to the effects of the compulsory-education act passed in 1900.

The registration in the State universities in 1912-13 was as fol- 
lows: Leiden, 1,211 students; Utrecht, 1,096; Groningen, 579. The 
municipal university at Amsterdam had 1,215 students and the pri- 
vate university in that city 150. 
In addition to the schools included in the table there are many 
technical schools, and also a university of private foundation at 
Rotterdam with special equipment for the sciences relating to 
commerce. 
The expenditure by the Government for education amounts an- 
nually to about thirteen and a quarter million dollars. The com- 
munes increase this by nearly eight millions.? 
ACTIVITIES OF THE TEACHER'S ASSOCIATION. 
The Teachers’ Association of the Netherlands (Nederlandsch 
Onderwijzers-Genootschap), at Amsterdam, has maintained for the 
past four years a course of instruction in pedagogy for teachers who 
are interested in the science of education and in researches pertain- 
ing to the nature of young children and adolescents. The present 
year the association looked to the normal school at Brussels for 
assistance in carrying out its purposes with the result that Prof. 
Jonckheere was delegated for that mission by the Belgian minister 
of science and art and eventually submitted a report of the work. 
The instruction of the session was grouped around three main topics 
as follows: (1) Normal children and abnormal children; (2) scien- 
tific pedagogy; (3) pedology (facts and application). The subjects 
were treated by different professors or specialists of repute. The

INTELLECTUAL BONDS BETWEEN BELGIUM AND HOLLAND. 
Special interest attaches at this time to the sympathies and sense 
of kinship cemented between the Hollanders and their Flemish 
brothers in Belgium, through the influence of a school of Flemish 
poets and novelists which started in Belgium with the works of Guido 
Gezelle, called the Burns of Flanders, and is continued by a group 
of writers who have given very full expression to the Flemish spirit 
and aspiration. Naturally Holland is the only country outside of 
Belgium where these writings are read and understood. Dutch 
publishers compete with each other for the opportunity of publish- 
ing the works of these Flemish writers, and the most popular of all 
the song writers, Emiel Hullebroek, has delighted all Dutch lovers 
of popular music. To quote a recent article on the subject: ? 
Holland repays these beautiful gifts by sending her famous actors, Royaards and © 
Bouwmeester, to play in Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels; by sending her scholars 
to Belgium to lecture before the students of Brussels and Ghent; and every summer 
members of the university staff at Leiden give a course of holiday lectures to students 
from Belgium universities. 
This intellectual and literary intercourse and mutual appreciation has created, of 
late years, a strong feeling of what their German neighbors would call “Zusammenge- 
hérigkeit.’’ The Dutchman has begun to realize that his nation covers a wider field 
than a small area inclosed within his frontiers; the Fleming that it is not to France 
that he must look for inspiration congenial to his mind and natural talents. Both 
have conceived the possibilities of a “Greater Netherland.’’ Groot-Netherland is 
the name of a leading literary monthly, which is edited by the Dutch novelist Louis 
Couperus and his Flemish brother-in-art Cyriel Buysse. An intellectual “Groot- 
Nederland’’ is the aim they have in view.

EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 
THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
The system of public instruction in France is marked by centralized 
control, close organization, and uniform operation throughout the 
country. The chief of the system is a cabinet officer, the minister of 
public instruction and fine arts. The incumbent is naturally changed 
with every cabinet crisis, but the stability of the system is not 
seriously affected thereby, the directors of the three great depart- 
ments of the system, i. e., primary, secondary, and superior, being 
retained for long periods; even when changes occur the vacancy is 
generally filled by the logical successor of the departing officer. 
The authority of the minister of public instruction is modified 
by the advice of a superior council of education, which is formed partly 
by appointment and partly by the free choice of the professors and 
teachers in the three departments of education. Acting in advice 
with this council, the minister drafts all laws modifying the system, 
determines the programs and regulations for all classes of schools, 
and prepares the annual budget for presentation to the legislature. 
For local administration the system is divided into academies, 
17 in number, each of which comprises a university, secondary schools, 
and primary schools. At the head of each group is the rector, an 
official of great dignity, appointed by the President of the Republic 
and subordinate only to the minister. He is assisted by an academic 
council, which, like the superior council, is professional in its member- 
ship. The rector is the executive head of the university of his area. 
He has controlling authority over the secondary schools, and, 
7

718 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
nominally, also over primary schools; but the latter are under the im- 
mediate direction of inspectors (inspecteurs d’académie). 
The unit of primary school administration is the Department, a 
civil district which for educational purposes is treated as a sub- 
division of an academy. France (including Algiers) comprises 90 
Departments, which are unequally distributed among the 17 acade- 
mies. Chambéry, the smallest academy, comprises 2 Departments; 
Paris, the largest academy, 9. The Departments vary in extent and 
in population. The smallest has 101,000 inhabitants; the largest 
(Seine), four and a quarter millions. 
The expenses of primary education are met almost entirely by State 
appropriations; the proceeds of the local school tax being turned 
over to the State treasury. 
Each Department includes two normal schools (one for men and 
one for women) and the several classes of primary schools. The civil 
head of every Department is the prefect, appointed by the President 
of the Republic, and the only political official who has any authority 
over schools. His chief function in this respect is that of appointing 
the teachers of primary schools, a right which has been bitterly 
opposed for over half a century. It is restricted somewhat by the 
necessity of making the choice from a list of candidates approved 
by the academic inspector. — ; 
It will suffice here to mention only the councils, academic and 
departmental, which advise in respect to educational matters and the 
corps of primary school inspectors appointed for each Department 
and subordinate to the academic inspector. Every commune in a 
Department is required by law to establish one or more primary 
schools, according to the needs of the population. 
STATE OF PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
France belongs to the group of nations that have made adequate 
provision of primary schools, and it is further distinguished by the 
fact that almost every school is in charge of a teacher specially 
trained for the work. The inspectors of primary education are 
chosen from persons who have obtained the requisite diploma as the 
result of a competitive examination, and who have had experience 
as teachers and school directors; hence there is cordial cooperation 
between them and the teachers. Provision is also made in France 
for adult education through the union of public and private agencies 
in a work which is nation-wide in extent and in effects. 
The system of public primary education is, however, weak in two 
respects. The compulsory attendance law covers only the ages 6 to 13 
completed, with exemption for children who pass the required exam- 
ination at 12 years of age; there is no general provision for continuing 
the formal education of the mass of children beyond that period. 
 
-P-A-G-E-755
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 719 
The salaries of teachers are also inadequate, and out of all proportion 
to their needs and the increased cost of living. For the last half 
decade these conditions have been the subject of great solicitude 
on the part of the administrative and legislative bodies responsible 
for popular education. They are conditions not peculiar to France, 
but of peculiar urgency in that country because of its political 
organization and the changing conditions of its industrial life. 
THE TEACHING FORCE. 
The teaching force of the primary school comprises stagiaires, or 
probationary teachers, and titulaires, or teachers with full appoint- 
ments. The latter are divided into five classes, with ascending scale 
of salaries from the fifth to the first class. The law determines the 
percentage of the entire number allowed for each class. 
Teachers may be retired with pension at the age of 60 years if they 
have been in the service 30 years. Advancement from one grade in 
the salary scale to the next depends upon the vacancies that exist, 
and the latter are largely determined by the number of teachers who 
reach the age of retirement. 
The most urgent problem in respect to primary schools is that of 
teachers’ salaries. They are not only inadequate, but they are below 
the scale that is paid in other branches of the civil service requiring 
much less preparation than the teaching service. Further, on 
account of the system of promotion, teachers entering the service 
must wait a long time before they have any hopo of reaching the 
better-paying positions. The difficulty has become acute; rural 
teachers have been particularly dissatisfied, and the number of can- 
didates for admission to the departmental normal schools has fallen 
off. During the current year the Chamber of Deputies voted an 
amount for teachers’ salaries that would have made general promo- 
tions possible, but these estimates were reduced in the Senate, and 
the emergencies of the war prevented any further effort in this direc- 
tion. The status of the teachers remains, therefore, as it was fixed 
by the financial Jaw of 1905. The salaries actually in effect for the 
latest year reported (1912), exclusive of cities having 150,000 inhabit- 
ants or more, were as follows:

Additional allowances were, for masters of the sixth class, 200 
franes ($40) in lieu of residence; for masters of the first class, 400 
francs ($80) in lieu of residence. 
An important measure adopted by the Chamber of Deputies during 
the year provided for the transfer of the appointing power from the 
prefects of Departments to the academic rectors. In a review of this 
action, M. Buisson recalls that in 1850, when the law was passed giving 
the prefects the right to appoint teachers, the action met with intense 
opposition. It was explained, however, that it was intended at the 
time to save the teaching force from socialists and reactionary ele- 
ments and would not be in operation more than six months; but it 
has been maintained for over 60 years, with the single modification 
introduced by the education law of 1886, which limited the choice of 
the prefect by the approval of the academic inspector. The new 
measure, as it passed the Chamber of Deputies, provided that all 
deliberations affecting the positions of teachers should be conducted _ 
in a committee consisting of the academic inspector, the primary 
inspectors, and representatives of the normal and primary schools of 
the particular department. 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
Leaders of all parties in France are agreed that the provision of 
continuation schools is an-urgent need. Without them France must 
fall to a low plane as regards popular intelligence and commercial and 
industrial efficiency. The work of adult education, carried forward 
mainly by the unselfish efforts of elementary teachers, does not reach 
children just free from school, and even in its application to adults it 
falls short of adequate results, from the want of unified direction and 
close organization. Measures for prolonging the term of compulsory 
school attendance and appropriating funds for the establishment of 
continuation schools have been taken up annually by the legislature 
for nearly a decade, but no effective action in this matter has resulted. 
The present premier of France, M. Viviani, championed the cause 
last year during his brief term as minister of public instruction, but 
was forced to admit that the time was not ripe for action in the 
matter. He was not able even to secure a small appropriation, 
35,600 francs ($7,120), for the purpose of carrying on an active cam- 
paign, under official auspices, in behalf of the cause and of coordinat- 
ing and directing the work of private agencies in this field of endeavor. 
THE EDUCATION OF ADULTS, 
The twentieth report on the work of popular education, submitted | 
to the minister of public instruction by M. Edouard Petit, covers 
the year ending June, 1914. The work was hindered during the year 
by the severe winter, social disturbances, and the call for all young

service (law of 1913). In the evening classes the attendance of young 
men fell off, and the loss was not entirely made up by the increase 
in the number of young women. The number attending different 
courses of instruction for adults was 54,493 (for young men, 32,159; 
young women, 22,334); the number attending popular lectures was 
61,027. 
To this important work 83,339 teachers, men and women, and 
15,442 persons not connected with the schools freely gave their 
services. The expenditures were met chiefly by private subscrip- 
tions and municipal appropriations, the latter amounting to $315,814. 
The State contributed about $200,000, of which $13,140 was accorded 
to teachers as indemnities or rewards. 
The Musée Pédagogique and the Ligue de l’Enseignement have 
large collections of magic lantern views, which have been distributed 
all over the country for use in classes and lectures. The popularity 
of these fixed views, however, is declining before the superior attrac- 
tions of motion pictures, and the ligue is now considering the means 
of supplying the latter for the classes and lectures. 
Included in this general movement are the following social welfare 
activities: 
Mutualités Scolaires (mutual aid societies), numbering 4,666, with 
870,094 members, of whom 477,775 were schoolboys and the remain- 
der girls. This organization maintains a campaign in favor of pre- 
ventive hygiene. Tho Paris branches united during the year to 
send sickly children included in the organization to an open-air 
school at Montigny-sur-Loing. Other branches devoted part of 
their funds to sending weak and delicate children to vacation colonies 
in the country. 
Petites A. (associations of former pupils): These associations, which 
are recreative in their aim, numbered 7,042. They organize excur- 
sions and trips, engage in sports, and form companies for physical 
training, and also classes for moral and civic instruction. 
Patronages Scolaires, which number 2,878, are local societies 
pledged to look after the welfare of the children of their respective 
communities. 
STATISTICAL SUMMARY. 
For the last year reported (1911-12) the department of primary 
education comprised 3,986 infant schools (écoles maternelles, for 
children 5 to 6 years of age) with 8,693 teachers and 620,561 pupils; 
82,787 primary schools (for children 6 to 13 years), with 158,367 
teachers (men 66,146, women 92,221) and an enrollment of 5,682,352, 
equivalent to 14.6 per cent of the population. Clerical schools 
formed only a small per cent of the total provision; private secular

schools numbered 12,945, employed 35,618 teachers, a little more than 
one-fifth the total number, and enrolled 1,007,743 pupils, or a little 
less than one-fifth the total. 
Included in the total enrollment were 102,687 pupils (51,057 boys, 
51,630 girls) in higher primary schools or advanced classes (cours 
complémentaires). These higher grade schools may retain pupils 
up to 15 years of age; for admission, candidates must have obtained 
the certificate of primary students. The schools are not vocational, 
but offer special courses in drawing, manual work, and elementary 
science. They must be distinguished from the ‘‘écoles profes- 
sionnelles,” that is, schools of commerce and industry of the samo 
grade but under different administration. These enrolled the same 
year 15,000 students. Thus, altogether, about 118,000 young people - 
of the industrial classes were continuing their studies in schools 
comparable with the upper grades and the junior high schools of the 
United States. Inthe organization of the French system, the normal 
schools for training elementary teachers are included in the depart- 
ment of primary education. The total number of primary, normal 
schools is 166 (84 for men, 82 for women). Their enrollment in 
1912-13 was 9,588 (4,629 men, 4,959 women). The current expendi- 
ture for primary education is very nearly met by the State appro- 
priation, which amounted in 1913 to 225,000,000 franes ($45,000,000). 
The State also contributed 10,000,000 francs ($2,000,000) toward the 
construction of school buildings. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
CURRENT MOVEMENTS. 
In considering the current record of secondary education in France, 
it is important to keep in mind two characteristics: First, the com- 
plete separation of secondary schools, lycées, and colleges, from pri- 
mary schools; second, the organization of the secondary schools in 
two cycles, the first comprising four years, the second three years. 
In regard to the first condition, it should be recalled that recent 
efforts have been directed to unifying the courses of primary and sec- 
ondary studies, and with a certain measure of success; as a rule, how- 
ever, children of the class who go to the primary schools never expect 
to enter the State lycées or even the local colleges, which are of a lower 
grade. 2 
The programs of secondary education adopted in 1902 provided for 
parallel sections, as follows: In the first cycle, two sections for the 
first two years, one with Latin, the other without; in the fourth and 
third classes a third section with Greek. The second cycle comprises 
four sections; namely, section A, termed the Latin and Greek sec- 
tion; section B, Latin; section C, Latin and sciences; section D,
-P-A-G-E-759
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 723 
sciences and modern languages. Three of these sections, it will bo 
seen, preserve the study of Latin—make it in fact the center of their 
instruction, and may, therefore, properly be regarded as classical 
sections. The relative strength of these sections has great signifi- 
cance in respect to the present state of secondary education in 
France which, above all other countries, preserves the classical spirit. 
The enrollment in tho three sections with Latin and in tho section 
without Latin for five successive years is shown in the following 
table:

The official regulations not only prescribe the program to be fol- 
lowed, but determine the amount of time to be allowed for each sub- 
ject. Attention was called in the commissioner’s report for 1912 to 
changes in the distribution of time which went into effect October, 
1913. These were brought about by the common agreement of teach- 
ers, parents, and physicians, and they provided for a reduction in the 
number of recitation hours and in the number of different subjects 
between which the time of the pupil was divided and his attention 
distributed. By the union of allied subjects it was found possible to 
arrange so that in the earlier years a pupil might remain longer under 
the direction of one master whose essential task it should be to teach 
him to study; as the pupil grows older he may well be left more to 
his own personal efforts. In the group of language studies new 
emphasis was given to the pursuit of Latin as a means of perfecting 
the student in his native tongue; an endeavor was also made to pre- 
vent further decline in the study of Greek by creating a classical 
division in which this language should be obligatory. The effect of 
these changes can not yet be determined; they indicate, however, the 
careful scrutiny of secondary education, which is regarded as the 
chief formative influence in national life. 
QUESTIONS DISCUSSED AT THE CONGRESS OF PROFESSORS. 
The tenth congress of the national federation of professors in the 
lyeées for boys, and of the teaching corps in those for girls, held its 
annual meeting in Paris at the Lycée Louis le Grand, beginning April  
-P-A-G-E-760
  
  724 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
17 of the present year. The president of the federation in his opening 
address reported the partial success of the efforts of a committee on 
salaries appointed at the meeting of 1913. This was indicated by a 
decree issued September 6 providing for the more rapid advancement 
of professors, and thus increasing their chances for the higher salaries. 
The state of national finances precluded action on the plan for a gen- 
eral advance in the salaries of all positions. The discussion of the 
salary question was continued during the current meeting, but without 
resulting in any additional propositions. 
Second only in importanee to the salary question was that of the 
reorganization of secondary education for girls. In the original 
scheme of study for these institutions no effort was made to duplicate 
the program of lycées for boys, the distinctive character of the former 
being determined by reference to the careers, social and industrial, 
upon which young women were likely to enter. The opening of 
higher teaching positions and other professional careers to women has 
greatly increased the number who desire university training with the 
opportunity of securing diplomas ; but since the lycées for girls did not 
prepare students for admission to the universities, these ambitious 
young women were obliged to make their preparation by private 
tuition. In order to correct this injustice it was determined in 1909 
to open a special course in a few lycées for girls similar to that of the 
lyeées for boys, and, like the latter, preparing for the bachelor’s 
diploma. This action and the continued demand for larger provision 
for the education of women have led to the current movement for 
reorganizing the scheme of secondary education for girls. In the 
discussion before the federation the question of a model scheme for 
the education of girls was considered from every standpoint and 
elicited a variety of opinions; but it was universally agreed that full 
provision should be made for placing girls on an equality with boys 
in respect to admission to the universities. Differences of opinion 
arose in respect to the best way of accomplishing this end, while at 
the same time preserving the adaptation of the courses of instruction 
to the needs of the majority of young women. The commission 
finally adopted a proposition offered by Prof. Suran, of the Lycée 
Marseille, as follows: The program of studies for the lycées for girls 
should cover seven years. After the close of the first year it should 
be organized in two parallel sections up to the end of the sixth year. 
One of these sections should lead to the diploma of studies ereated for 
this class of institutions; the other to the first part of the examination 
for the bachelor’s degree; the seventh year should be given to prepa- 
ration for the second or final part of that examination. This resolu- 
tion embodies the prevailing opinions in France, at the present time, 
with respect to the conduct of higher education for women. It is to 
be differentiated from that of boys, but with full opportunity for those

THE UNIVERSITIES. 
The universities of France are State institutions, depending 
chiefly upon annual appropriations from the public treasury for 
their maintenance. The measure of autonomy conferred upon them 
by the law of 1896 has had the effect of stimulating their individual 
activities and of drawing support from local sources. At the begin- 
ning of the present year the prospect of the universities as regards 
increased income and vigorous action was extremely promising, but 
the catastrophe of war has indefinitely postponed the realization of 
the hopes then exacted, and at present, when professors and students 
are in the heat of the conflict and the life of the nation threatened, 
it is only possible to indicate the direction in which progress was 
expected by reference to measures proposed and recent develop- 
ments. 
FINANCIAL NEEDS. 
The need of more liberal appropriations for the universities was 
urged upon the attention of the Senate in the current session by the 
chairman of the budget committee, M. Lintilhac, who called particular 
attention to what he termed the ‘‘sad and humiliating condition of 
the laboratories.”’ He recalled that not long since an eminent pro-  
-P-A-G-E-762
    726 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
fessor at the Collége de France, renowned for his researches into the 
causes of diabetes, which had been taken up with great enthusiasm by 
scientists of other countries, had been obliged to discontinue his 
work for want of necessary support. Another professor of the 
Collége de France, the fame of whose researches had attracted 
students from Chile, had only ‘‘an old shed” in which to receive 
them. The dilapidated walls were repaired at their own expense, 
and the electrical apparatus necessary for continuing the researches 
was bought by the professor with the aid of the foreign students. 
Even the faculty of sciences of tho new Sorbonne has its laboratories 
either in the basement, where the light is poor, or in the upper story 
of the building which is reached only by climbing long flights of 
stairs. 
NEW EQUIPMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS. > 
This depressing view was relieved by the prospect of immediate 
constructions for which the necessary sites and funds have already 
been secured. Most important among the extensions for the Uni- 
versity of Paris is the Institute of Radium for which the university 
and the Pasteur Institute have furnished 680,000 francs ($136,000), 
in addition to the site furnished by the university alone. The 
radium institute will be organized in two parts, one devoted to 
scientific researches and placed under the direction of Madam Curie 
and her successors in the chair of physics named for Pierre Curie. 
The other devoted to medical researches under tho direction of the 
Pasteur Institute. Tho building will occupy a portion of a large 
area on which the new institute of chemistry is under construction, 
and two other buildings which have been proposed, namely, one 
devoted to the history of art, the other to geographical science. 
The University of Paris has recently received gifts and bequests, 
which, although small from the American standpoint, are large from 
that of France. A review of progress since 1905 shows donations 
between that year and 1910 amounting to 1,620,000 frances; since the 
latter year the university has received two legacies of 2,500,000 franes 
each, and two from the same donor, the Marquise Arconati-Visconti, 
of 500,000 franes each, to be employed in the best interests of the 
university. Individual faculties have also been favored, especially 
the faculties of medicine and science; the former by a capital sum 
of 200,000 franes ($50,000), the income of which is to be employed in 
researches in bacteriology and pathologic anatomy. 
DEPARTMENTAL UNIVERSITIES. 
Among departmental universities that have had important ad- 
ditions to their buildings are the following: Lille, which has just 
taken possession of its new library and of a mining museum. The 
university is arranging also for am annex to the faculty of medicine,
-P-A-G-E-763
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 727 
comprising a laboratory and clinical service of hygiene. This will be 
installed in an ancient convent and equipped by the Department du 
Nord. 
At Lyon, the faculty of medicine will soon have at its command a 
new city hospital of the highest type, intended to be a model in 
organization and appointments. 
At Nancy, an institute of physics and an institute of applied 
mechanics have been recently installed and equipped for practical 
work; institutes of aviation and geology are nearing completion. In 
connection with the faculty of medicine, a dental school, the first of 
its order in France, has been installed and fully equipped. 
Rennes has become the object of unusual local interest and liber- 
ality, and without expense to the State treasury has been recently 
enriched by new buildings and appointments for a school of medicine. 
Students at Rennes have an advantage from tho fact that tho uni- 
versity library, the municipal library, and the collections of municipal 
archives are all situated om the same grounds. A similar concen- 
tration is noticeable at Toulouse, where the university library, and 
the historic art collections are housed in close proximity to each 
other. 
SCHOLASTIC EXTENSIONS. 
In addition to the increase in material resources should be noted 
extensions of the curricula of the universities through the foundation 
of new chairs and provision for auxiliary courses of instruction. At 
Paris these extensions are naturally most varied, as befits its wide 
scope, but even here special tendencies are noticeable. The depart- 
mental universities are purposely developing specialties that pertain 
to their local or traditional interests. These tendencies are illustrated 
by the following examples: PARIS. 
  
Faculty of law.—Course in penal science, by professors of the 
faculties of law and of medicine; courses in adminsitration and 
finances, given by members of the faculty, aided by an inspector of 
finances, and other officials. Course leads to a certificate; course in 
colonial legislation raised to the rank of a chair in 1909. 
Faculty of sciences.—Course in applied chemistry raised to a chair 
in 1908 by means of a donation of 100,000 franes ($20,000) from the 
Society Solvay & Co. and 28,000 franes ($5,600) from the syndicate 
of chemical products, Paris. 
Faculty of letters—On account of the suppression of the State 
faculty of Protestant theology, the courses in history, which it com- 
prised, have been transferred to the Paris faculty of letters. There 
has also been great extension of the courses in modern European 
languages with subdivisions under special professors.
-P-A-G-E-764
  728 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
DEPARTMENTS. 
Provision for new and extended courses of instruction in geography 
has been made since 1905 at Bordeaux, Clermont, Grenoble, and 
Rennes. 
The following are notable examples of provision for specialties per- 
taining to local industries or interests: 
At Besangon a course of instruction in chronometry; at Clermont 
a school of industrial chemistry annexed to the university; at Gre- 
noble an institute of commercial instruction; at Lille, Caen, and 
Toulouse special courses in the history of local art and antiquities 
have been organized. Lyon has given great extension to the study 
of the Orient, including languages, social and political institutions. 
A noticeable feature of the provision for linguistic studies is the 
organization of courses of instruction and research in phonetics at 
Grenoble and Lille. This subject has assumed such importance in 
connection with researches into the origin of language that the 
University of Paris has created an institute of phonetics common to 
the faculties of letters, of sciences, and of medicine. 
The following tables summarize information pertaining to the 
universities and professional schools of university grade for the

Of the women students included in the total, more than half, i. e., 
2,197 (1,120 French, 1,077 foreign) were at the University of Paris. 
Universities registering more than 100 women: Aix-Marseille, 112 (2 
foreign); Bordeaux, 190 (174 French, 16 foreign); Grenoble, 308 (94 
French, 214 foreign); Montpellier, 220 (77 French, 148 foreign); 
Nancy, 156 (53 French, 103 foreign); Toulouse, 182 (120 French, 
62 foreign). 
The following special schools of university rank are also under the 
minister of public instruction: 
. Collége de France (appropriation, statistics for 1912, $118,302); 
Museum of Natural History (appropriation, $251,858); Practical 
School of High Studies [Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes] (State 
appropriation, $75,232); Superior Normal School (appropriation, 
$55,385), reunited to the University of Paris by a ministerial decree, 
November 1, 1904; School of Archives [Ecole Nationale des Chartes] 
(appropriation, $16,500); School of Oriental Languages (appropria- 
tion, $35,050); French School of Archeology at Rome (appropria- 
tion, $16,000); French School at Athens (appropriation, $24,600); 
Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts (appropriation, $84,052). 
The University of Paris is the central body in a group of higher 
institutions devoted to letters and science. The number of such 
schools under the minister of public instruction has been recently 
increased by institutions founded by private benefactions, namely, 
the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, the Collége Libre des Sciences 
Sociales, the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Sociales, and the Keole de 
Journalisme, all founded within the decade by private benefactions. 
Paris is also the city of the most important private university in 
France, which includes a faculty of Catholic theology; a private 
faculty of Protestant theology was also established after the sepa- 
ration of church and state was accomplished. °The liberal provision 
for higher education at the capital is increased by technical schools

  PRIVATE AND MUNICIPAL ACTIVITIES. 
The progress of elementary schools and of the higher institutions 
for liberal education in France depends largely upon legislative 
action, which is more or less involved with the political situation at 
“any given time. There is, however, a wide field of educational en- 
deavor that is independent of Government action. Special training 
for the industrial arts and for commercial business is promoted 
chiefly by private societies and individuals, aided by municipal 
authorities and often by the Government itself. Every city in France 
is a center of such activities, which date, practically, from the revo- 
lution of 1830, that gave the direction of public affairs to men dis- 
tinguished for business enterprise and specially fitted to exploit the 
material resources of the country and to apply the resources of 
science and new motive powers to the use of industry and trade. 
The Polytechnic Association, formed in 1830, and the Philotechnic, 
which dates from 1848, made the education of the artisan classes 
their chief object. Both societies were in time recognized by special 
decree as of public utility, and they are still actively engaged in pro- 
moting the education of artisans and clerks. This movement has 
been greatly extended by the trade unions or syndicates of workmen 
which are not only centers of political and economic agitation, but 
of support for a high order of art and craft education. The combi- 
nation of these various forces and their fruitful results are strikingly 
illustrated by the provision for industrial and commercial educa- 
tion in the city of Lyon, which is described in the following report: 
COMMERCIAL AND TRADE TRAINING IN LYON.! 
Industrial and mercantile education taught in day schools and in night schools has 
been perfected to a rare degree in the city of Lyon. Instruction in nearly every

department of technical and theoretical learning is given by professionals, and, where 
practicable, by men actually engaged in the particular vocations they teach. Para- 
mount importance is naturally attached to industries peculiar to Lyon, such as various 
branches of the silk trade, but there are indeed few lines of wage-earning employment 
that are completely omitted. This is the more worthy of attention as the institutions 
in question are poor business investments from the standpoint of pecuniary return. 
In fact, many of the schools would be forced to close were it not for subsidies from the 
French Government, the local chamber of commerce, and the municipality, as well 
as gifts from successful graduates and other interested friends. 
A local organization known as the Society for Professional Instruction, or in French 
Société d’Enseignement Professionnel, has united the various schools into what might 
be termed a large and loosely connected business university. This organization is 
partly municipal, and men of eminence are among its members of honor, beginning 
with the President of France. The number of students attending the courses of this 
society has ever since its foundation some 50 years ago averaged about 5,000, and, 
altogether, a quarter of a million students have received instruction. At present 
some 8,000 students are being instructed. Strikes tend to lower the attendance, 
though one might believe that during periods of idleness the workman would be will- 
ing to employ his time at these special schools. There are 84 courses for men, 83 for 
women, and 17 for men and women together. The average age of the students is 18, 
with a tendency ever since its foundation to decrease. A library of 6,400 volumes 
is at the disposal of the students and has branches in different parts of the city to 
facilitate distribution. 
Consideriag the thoroughness of the instruction, the wide range of subjects, and 
the accessibility to the courses of study, it is extraordinary that the tuition fee for 
six months is only 3 francs ($0.579). Even this amount would not be required had 
the society not found that the attention and diligence of the student are enhanced 
by the payment of this minimum sum, thus eliminating any idea of charity. Men 
who are serving their term in the army are admitted at half this price. To aid these, 
as well as the others, who are nearly all wage earners during the day or students in 
other schools, the hours of instruction are from 7.30 to 10 p. m. and on Sunday morn- 
ings. 
Tn stimulating class spirit and spurring the ambition of the individual students 
by considering their wants and aspirations before everything else, these schools are 
only equaled by the universities of the United States. Twenty students are sufficient 
to open a course, and of ali the courses offered very few are not given. By vote of 
the students a number of courses can be held over the summer when the schools are 
ordinarily closed. Last year 56 courses were thus prolonged. 
The budget of the Société d’Enseignement Professionnel is interesting in many 
ways. The following figures are for 1911-12, the last year for which statistics have 
been issued:

An occasional deficit is balanced from an available reserve fund of 68,224.50 francs 
($13,167.33). During the past year the expenses were higher than they have ever 
been before, the cause assigned being the increased cost of living. At an expenditure 
of about 18 francs ($3.47) per caput, a year’s instruction in an average of three thor- 
oughly well-conducted courses is given to 6,000 or 7,000 students. This is done by 
lowering as much as possible all general expenses, while fully paying the teachers 
for their work. Many of the rooms and houses in which the courses are held are lent 
to the society by the municipality and the public institutions in Lyon. In certain 
courses the students are taken through factories and allowed minute examination 
of all processes. The governmental aerodrome is open to those who take the course 
on aviation. Local automobile works are glad to demonstrate their various methods 
to students seeking mechanical instruction. The printing presses of the daily press 
of Lyon, as well as shoe factories, chocolate factories, textile mills, and many other 
industrial establishments, contribute largely to practical training. No better com- 
mendation of these schools can be asked than the fact that nearly every business 
man in Lyon has been an attendant himself or is connected directly or indirectly 
with the institution. Fora few of these courses—weaving, tailoring, foreign languages, 
for example—an extra fee, in some cases as high as 15 francs ($2.90), is asked. The 
society is conducted by an administrative council and a president named by the 
council. This body is composed of 82 members and is elected in certain general 
assemblies at which the attendance of all the members of the society, as well as of 
the professors, is requested. Each year one of these assemblies elects one-fourth of 
the council, and the work to be done during the year is prescribed, financial matters 
gone over, and all necessary projects carefully discussed. In this manner an insti- 
tution is managed to whieh Lyon owes much of its prestige as a commercial and 
manufacturing city. 
Highly useful among other institutions in Lyon is the so-called Martiniére, founded 
and endowed by Gen. Claude Martin over acentury ago. Since then various contribu- 
tions of 1,000 to 2,500,000 francs ($193 to $482,500) have swelled the originalfund. The 
annual running expenses last published amounted to 265,479.64 francs ($51,237.57). 
Under the authority of the French Government this school is administered by a com- 
mission of seven members. The mayor of Lyon is the president, and the members are 
chosen by the municipal council and appointed by the minister of commerce. The 
institution comprises a school for boys and one for girls, respectively called School for 
the Sciences and Industrial Arts of Lyon and Professional and Housework School of 
Lyon. Both schools are gratuitous, though the books and other necessary supplies 
for instruction must be furnished by the students. The price for these ranges be- 
tween 6 and 12 francs ($1.16 and $2.32) per annum. The School for Sciences and 
Industrial Arts has from 500 to 600 students. It may be termed a secondary technical 
school, giving instruction in many branches of industry and commerce. The com- 
plete course takes four years, After the third year the students are divided into 
two distinct sections, commercial or industrial. The examinations at the end of the 
fourth year take place before a special jury. Diplomas of first and second class are 
given to the higher-grade students on leaving; the first-class diplomas of the indus-

trial section qualify holders for the admission examinations to the National Schools 
of Arts and Professions. The administration of the school and the director are active 
in obtaining situations for graduating students. The school year begins in October 
and lasts to the 14th of July. No one is admitted during the year or allowed to make 
two years of study in one year, except in special cases after absence on account of 
sickness, and only when sanctioned by the administrative council. A limited number 
of students whose parents so desire may take a fifth year of instruction, with permis- 
sion of the directors. Students must be children of parents who are both French. 
Successful candidates are admitted directly into one of the four-year courses, according 
to the grade reached in the examinations, which are given twice a year, June and 
September, with permission, in case of failure in the first, to try again in the later 
examination. A gratuitous and voluntary course, preparatory for the examinations, 
is given in the summer months. Application for admission must be made by parents 
or their representatives. 
There has been an average attendance of 300 students in the Professional and House- 
work School. The complete courses take three years, and students are only admitted 
after an examination. The general housework instruction is given to all students, 
but the professional teaching differs according to the classes. In the morning the 
students of the same year work together in the courses of general instruction. In the 
afternoon the sections are separated and put into a regular workshop, made to follow 
as nearly as possible actual conditions of the vocation chosen. There are three 
sections of professional instruction: Commerce, dressmaking and sewing, and em- 
broidery. On entrance, students are asked to select one of these three branches. 
No one is allowed to pursue one of the general courses without at the same time attend- 
ing one of the three sections of practical instruction. Upon completion of the third 
year the students are given diplomas, first and second class. Care is taken to secure 
good positions for successful graduates. 
A colonial instruction school has been organized by the chamber of commerce and 
most of the courses are given in the commerce building. The object is to instruct 
students in all things absolutely necessary to life in French possessions over seas. 
After two years of attentive study, money prizes are awarded, which enable meri- 
torious students to make trips to the colonies themselves, The chamber pledges itself 
to give such employment as it disposes of in the colonies. The candidates must pass 
arigid entrance examination to attend these courses and a similarly searching exam- 
ination on leaving. The entrance fee is returned to these students. A second group 
of students is authorized to take lessons in modern languages not given in the colonial 
course, such as English, Spanish, and Italian, at an outside school of languages, free 
of cost. Students under 16 are not admitted. Another group admitted without 
examination, but required to take at least two courses, have a right to a ‘‘certificate 
of assiduity ” and to the free lessons at the language school, in case the first group does 
not take all the vacancies. The sum of 5 francs ($0.965) is asked as an entrance fee. 
Provision is made for a third group, ‘‘free listeners.” The courses are nearly all held 
at night. They include tropical hygiene, history and geography of the colonies, 
Chinese (first year), Chinese (second year), sericulture, economics and legislation, 
manners and customs of the Far East, Arabic (first year), and Arabic (second year). 
It is in the colonial school-that many of the future employees of the Government are 
prepared, and instruction in such subjects as sericulture tends to spread Lyon’s home 
industry in silk to the colonies. This institution, of comparatively recent origin, is 
becoming more generally known, and is increasing steadily in numbers and impor- 
tance, as the inducements to enter are more attractive every year. 
The Superior School of Commerce at Lyon ranks high among the business schools 
of France. It is assisted by the municipality, the chamber of commerce, and local 
organizations. It is divided into two sections: (1) General commerce and banking, 
and (2) silk weaving and other textile industries. As this gives a very thorough busi-
-P-A-G-E-770
  134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
ness instruction, the price of tuition is high, but does not exceed 910 francs ($175.63) 
a year. Students are taken.as boarders at the price of 130 to 150 francs ($25.09 to 
$28.95) amonth. The minimum age is 16. Foreign students are admitted at higher 
rates. To obtain a graduation certificate, an examination after a two years’ course 
is necessary in the banking division, but not in silk weaving. Prizes, some as high 
as 2,500 francs ($482.50), are granted, for purposes of travel, to those who have shown 
themselves particularly deserving. Among the administrative careers it may be 
noted that half of the vacant places for vice consuls of France are open to graduates 
of the Superior Schools of Commerce. Employment is given in the administration 
bureaus of the ministries of commerce and labor, of finance, and of the colonies, and 
in other special governmental work. It also prepares for the examinations of the 
Bank of France and the Credit Foncier, and the commercial sections of mines and 
railways. The school takes great care in finding employment for its graduates, in 
which itis helped by the old graduates. In its entirely separate weaving department 
no admission examination is required. Theoretical and practical instruction is given 
to those who desire to belong to the silk, cotton, or linen industry in any of its branches. 
Here, asin all the other departments of this institution, most of the hours of the morn- 
ing and of the afternoon are taken up with study. Weaving rooms with electric looms, 
a filature, and room for hand weaving are supplied among other aids to instruction. 
Students may choose from two lines of instruction; one is very complete, taking two 
years, comprising, outside of the theory and practice of weaving, useful accessory 
courses; the other requires only one year’s study, but covers only the theory and 
practice of weaving. 
An important addition to the facilities for commercial education offered by the 
city of Lyon was made last year when the University of Lyon, with the assistance 
of the chamber of commerce, established the Lyonnaise Institute of Economic and 
Political Sciences. The education given by the university has been largely shaped, 
up to the present time, to fit the needs of those studying for a professional career, and 
none of the courses in the university proper was deemed by its authorities to be ofa 
sufficiently broad and general character to adapt itself to the different administrative, 
industrial, commercial, and financial careers open to the young man who wished to 
enter banking, insurance, the consular service, or political life. The Lyonnaise 
Institute of Economic and Political Sciences affords a short and complete commercial 
education. Students may take the required two years’ course in the institute at the 
same time that they follow the regular university courses, if they so desire. It is not 
necessary, however, to be a student at the university or to have any certificates or 
diplomas in order to enter this commercial school. The institute is organized in two 
sections, economic and political, respectively, both of which are of two years’ duration. 
Diplomas are given to those who are successful in passing the required examinations. 
The total cost of either course of this special practical training amounts to 380 francs 
($73.34). A general idea of the studies covered by this institution may be had from 
the following subjects treated: Political economy; financial, industrial, and commer- 
cial law; economic and colonial geography; hygiene; diplomatic usage and modern 
history; international law; practical studies in accounting, banking, insurance, and 
the diplomatic and consular careers. To these may also be added the study of foreign 
languages. The courses are open to those coming from abroad as well as to French 
students. 
A progressive spirit in public and private enterprise is everywhere manifest in 
Lyon in affording the best facilities for livelihood-producing education. The response 
shown by the students in attendance and application, whether in the day or night 
schools, in taking advantage of the exceptional opportunities is prompt and sure. 
The combined efforts of donors, teachers, and pupils have accordingly given results 
in the upward swing of local commerce and trade that may well command serious 
consideration.

EDUCATION IN SWITZERLAND. 135 
SWITZERLAND. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Public education in Switzerland, as regards its administration and 
its operations, has been fully described in recent publications of this 
-office.t It will suffice to recall here that it is provided for by cantonal 
‘systems developed in accordance with a clause of the federal consti- 
tution which requires every one of the 25 Cantons “‘to provide sufli- 
“cient elementary education” free to all children without prejudice to 
“freedom. of faith and conscience.” With this restriction, every 
Canton has entire management of its schools. This independence is 
indivated by the varied organization of the several systems, some of 
~which reflect French influences; others, German and Italian influences; 
but in all there is evident & common purpose, namely, to develop 
every order of ability among the people and to afford adequate 
preparation for every calling, professional or industrial, that may be 
exercised in the Republic. 
The independent control of education thus guaranteed is jealously 
guarded by the local governments; at the same time the need of 
federal aid in this work has been recognized, and in 1902 an amend- 
ment to the constitution was authorized by popular vote which 
established the obligation of the Federal Government to subsidize 
primary schools. The right of cantonal control was reaffirmed in the 
amendment. The amount of the federal subsidy is fixed at the uni- 
form rate of 60 centimes (12 cents) per capita of the population, 
excepting in eight Cantons, in which, by reason of special difficulties, 
the rate is increased by 20 centimes (4 cents). This subsidy, which 
in 1913 amounted to 2,000,000 francs ($386,000), has aided greatly 
in equalizing the ashisal provision of the country. 
The military system adopted in 1875 provided for oe exam- 
inations, and these have fostered education by exciting keen rivalry 
among the Cantons in respect to the success of their youth in the tests.   
  THE FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
The Polytechnic Institute at Zurich is the only federal institution 
in the Republic. It is one of the most important and highly equipped 
schools of that order in the world, and no expense is spared to keep 
its equipment fully up to date. In standards it is of the same grade 
as the universities, and a candidate for admission must have the 
certificat de maturité, that is, a diploma of a Swiss middle school, or 
submit to an examination. Students who do not desire to follow a 
prescribed courso leading to the final certificate are admitted as

irregular or special students, but even these must pass an entrance 
examination for admission to the specialized technical divisions. 
Many men of mature years and settled pursuits desire to avail them- 
selves of the lecture and laboratory facilities of the institution, and 
for these, special arrangements are made. The institution comprises: 
School of architecture; engineering school; mechanico-technical 
school; school of chemical technology; agricultural and forestry 
division; and three general sections—(1) school of special teachers in 
mathematical and science subjects; (2) general philosophy and State 
economy division; (3) military science division. 
The course of instruction in the several schools is arranged for 
three and one-half or four years; students who complete the course 
which they may select receive a leaving certificate showing the averago 
mark obtained during the course, both in the obligatory subjects and 
in optional subjects, and attesting success in the final examination. 
The fees for the various courses are low, inscriptions and entrance 
fees together amounting to 20 francs ($4); the yearly school fees to 
150 franes ($30); also fees for use of library and laboratory apparatus 
ranging from 5 francs ($1) to 75 francs ($15). The annual term com- 
prises two semesters, one opening April 15 and the other October 15. 
The appropriation for the institute from the federal treasury, in 1913, 
was 1,170,810 francs ($234,162).

EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES, 1914. 
The opening of the year 1914 was marked in Germany by public 
ceremonies and festivities commemorating a century of national 
life and progress. In these activities the educational world, through 
its numerous associations and journals, bore a prominent part, 
reviewing those achievements which had given the nation a sense 
of leadership in education and in science. This position had been 
freely conceded by other nations, as indicated by commissions 
recently sent to Germany from the United States, from Canada, 
Australia, and Sweden, to study the conduct of schools and higher 
institutions, their administration and the secrets of their efficiency. 
In the early summer of the current year a company of teachers from 
the United States sailed for Germany to study the system which has 
revolutionized the school system of Munich; experts sent in 1913, 
by the London County Council, to examine trade and technical 
education on the Continent, recognized in the German system ‘‘the 
long view” which must eventually lead that nation ‘‘to a foremost 
place as an industrial world power’; France has repeatedly paid 
tribute to the excellence of scientific education in Germany, and at 
the beginning of the year M. Viviani, in his brief term as minister of 
public instruction, used the example of the University of Leipzig 
in support of his plea for the endowment of a chair of Arabic in the 
University of Paris, as a measure both of commercial and diplo- 
matic wisdom. 
COMPLETENESS OF THE SCHOOL PROVISION. 
Abundant proof of the completeness of the school provision in 
Germany and of the vigor with which educational affairs are admin- 
istered is furnished by the latest statistical summary, which brings 
73226°—xp 1914—vor 1——47 . 737
-P-A-G-E-774
  738 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the record down to 1912, showing progress by half decades from 1901 
to 1911, inclusive. In a nation where educational provision is fully 
adequate to the demands and compulsory education laws are univer- 
sal and vigorously enforced, more frequent surveys are not needed. 
It is certain that under normal conditions school places will be found 
for all children, temporary provision being made wherever the growth 
of population makes it necessary. On the basis of increase in the 
five years 1906 to 1911, the elementary and middle schools of Ger- 
many, corresponding to the public schools of the United States, 
enrolled in 1914 about 11,100,000 pupils, which was a little more 
than 16 per cent of the population. As the compulsory provisions 
cover the full period of the elementary school, it follows that this 
large proportion of the people receive eight, or at least seven, years’ 
schooling. The compulsory provision has been generally extended 
to attendance upon continuation schools; hence additional train- 
ing is insured for all boys and a large proportion of girls for brief 
terms extending over two or three years. The ordinary schools and 
the continuation schools are invariably in charge of trained teachers. 
In this manner the doctrine of efficiency is applied to the child 
population. 
Above and apart from the schools for the people (Volksschulen and 
Mittelschulen) are the Gymnasia and Realschulen leading up to the 
universities and highest technical schools. These form together a 
complete system of liberal education and specialized training for 
the learned and technical professions. The preeminence of Ger- 
many in educational matters has been chiefly due to the splendid 
organization of all divisions of this system. This feature has not, 
however, obscured its weak points, which are admitted by the 
Germans themselves. 
CURRENT CRITICISMS. 
The growth of the Social Democratic Party has brought the ele- 
mentary school, the Volksschule, or the school of the people, under 
severe criticism. Complaint is made of the overcrowding, of the 
division of the schools by social classes and sectarian creeds, and the 
exclusion of elementary teachers from the cultural schools. Detailed 
statistics reveal an alarming proportion of retarded pupils. This is 
charged both to overcrowding and to the want of an understanding 
of children’s abilities or needs. Official reports show that in the 
largest cities of Prussia, where organization is at its best, only 45 per 
cent of the children in the elementary schools reach the eighth grade; 
of the remainder many never get beyond the fourth grade. Leipzig 
boasts that the average size of classes in its schools has been reduced 
to 40 pupils; nevertheless even in Leipzig 25 per cent do not reach 
the highest class. The question is raised whether this is a deficiency
-P-A-G-E-775
  GERMANY. 739 
in the children or in the instruction; it is agitated by the associations 
of teachers, and is the subject of solicitude on the part of the educa- 
tional authorities as shown by the large numbers of auxiliary teachers 
employed, and the formation of special classes to assist backward 
pupils. Auxiliary classes (Hilfsklassen) to the number of 1,800, with 
40,000 pupils, are reported in 300 cities. 
The advocates of the ‘‘Einheit” school, a common elementary school 
for all children, based on the doctrine of equal regard for both their 
active powers and receptive attitudes, see in it the one agent that may 
correct all serious evils of the present system; but schools of this type 
increase in numbers slowly, so that they do not affect the general 
situation. The most important movement in popular education per- 
tains to the increase and more varied adaptations of continuation 
schools. These are either general schools for making up deficiencies 
in the elementary branches or they are trade schools intended to 
increase the skill and earning capacity of their pupils. The latter 
react upon the elementary schools both by reason of their sifting 
process and their industrial bearings. 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
School legislation moves very slowly in the German States, and 
new laws are seldom enacted, but ministerial orders and regulations 
issued by local authorities have all the force of law. The extension 
of compulsory attendance requirements to continuation schools and 
the training of teachers for those schools have been the subjects of 
the most important recent regulations. The ministerial order for 
Prussia authorizing the larger towns to adopt by-laws making attend- 
ance upon continuation schools compulsory was extended last year 
to smaller towns and rural districts in seven provinces of the King- 
dom. A measure was also adopted in Hamburg making attendance 
upon industrial continuation schools compulsory for all males under 
18 years of age and above the legal school age. 
The minister of commerce, who is charged in Prussia with the 
interests of continuation schools, has recently issued a new plan of 
study for them which distinguishes more carefully between the 
schools for general instruction and the industrial schools and defines 
more exactly the character of the latter. 
The new school regulations for Bavaria, which went into effect 
January 1 of the present year, make decided changes in the school 
classification. They are introduced by provisions of the school law 
with respect to compulsory education as follows: ‘‘The period of 
compulsory attendance at schools begins at the end of the sixth year 
and lasts 10 years. Of. these, in the ordinary way, 7 are spent at the 
elementary school and 3 at the continuation school.” In the latter 
clause the words ‘‘elementary” and ‘‘continuation” are substituted
-P-A-G-E-776
  740 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
for ‘‘week-day” and ‘‘Sunday” in the original law. The expression 
“in the ordinary way” is understood to exclude those boys who are 
attending a higher school which prepares for the universities or tech- 
nical high schools. 
The new regulations divide the continuation schools into general 
continuation schools (Volksfortbildungsschule) and vocational con- 
tinuation schools (Berufsfortbildungsschule). A special request 
must be made to the responsible minister for permission to establish 
a school of the latter type. It must be shown that there is a sufficient 
number of young people needing the school before the request can be 
granted. Attention is called to the fact that the number of hours 
required in the old Sunday schools, i. e., 60 to 80 in a year, is increased 
to 140 under the new arrangements. Objections have arisen from 
the fact that the general continuation school is made an annex to 
the elementary school, which brings it under clerical control. In 
Munich this difficulty will not be of much importance, as under Dr. 
Kerschensteiner’s direction a comprehensive system of municipal 
vocational schools already exists. 
With regard to special features of the continuation schools of 
Munich, a recent report says: 
The particular contribution which Munich has made to the development of the 
continuation school movement consists in adding to the lists of theoretical and aca- 
demic subjects a course in actual shop practice within the school itself, instead of 
turning over to the masters the entire work of instruction in the mechanics of their 
trade. In the opinion of the Munich authorities this actual technical training within 
the school is necessary not only to give the apprentices a more comprehensive view of 
their trade than the masters are likely to give, but also to add zest and significance to 
the instruction in the theoretical subjects. The ranks of the journeymen and the 
masters in industry are recruited from apprentice boys of the special industrial con- 
tinuation schools. There is for these boys, however, no opening into the higher 
institutions of learning, nor into the learned professions. 
Girls who do not at the age of 10 elect to go into a middle school or at the age of 13 
into a preparatory school leading to a teachers’ seminary must attend the elementary 
school until the age of 14. If they do not then elect to enter one of the voluntary 
schools for training in commercial or industrial subjects or in household economics, 
they are obliged to attend a continuation school for theoretical instruction for three 
hours a week until they are 16 years old. In all schools, whether for boys or girls, 
instruction in religion is required of all pupils to the age of 16. 
The authorities of Munich have made plans for a considerable extension of the 
continuation school work for girls. As soon as funds are available the entire system 
will be put upon a basis similar to that already established for boys. Upon leaving 
the elementary school at the age of 14, girls will then be obliged to elect whether they 
will attend a commercial, an industrial, or a household economics course. 
The boys who go through the elementary and- the continuation schools are now 
barred, except in unusual cases, from gaining the privilege of the one-year military 
service and also from securing these advantages of a higher education which are so 
freely open to the boys from the middle schools. It is apparent that there is a great 
social barrier between the two classes of boys. To break down this barrier and to 
open the door of opportunity to all boys alike, without reference to the wealth or the
-P-A-G-E-777
  GERMANY. 741 
social prestige of their parents, is the immediate aim of Dr. Kerschensteiner, the 
Munich superintendent, and of other other men of like mind. They are proposing 
the establishment of a school for industrial education where boys may qualify for the 
one-year military privilege, where they may receive a kind of training that will fit 
them for efficient work in the industrial field, and where they will be accorded as 
much social respect as is accorded to the boys of any other kind of school. Further- 
more, it is hoped that this type of school may ultimately be allowed to send its boys 
into the institutions for the higher education. According to the best German opinion, 
if such a school can be established, it will help to improve social conditions in several 
ways, perhaps most of all by attracting to industry many boys who now enter learned 
professions on account of the superior esteem in which these professions are held. 
Munich has at present 54 special continuation courses (Fachschulen) 
for boys, each representing a separate trade, and 11 continuation 
schools for general education centered around manual work. The 
number of pupils in these schools during the last year was 10,916, 
instructed in 428 classes. 
Fees charged in the classes are very low, the maximum for a 
Bavarian being about 50 cents a month, for which he may attend 
10 or more hours each week. The cost of the organization of the 
continuation schools in Munich is estimated in round numbers at 
$400,000, including cost of buildings. 
Although compulsion has been found necessary, endeavors are 
made to win the employers to the support of the schools by an appeal 
to their own interest. Periodical displays of the work are made 
which enable employers to see the importance of the instruction, and 
expert teachers are employed, who command their confidence. It is 
advised that every trade school shall have a directive board on which 
employers shall be represented, and they are also urged to make use 
of the vocational bureaus in choosing their young employees. The 
youth in training realizes the importance of the opportunity, because 
he is constantly reminded that he can not secure recognition as a quali- 
fied workman until he has submitted a sample of his work to be passed 
upon by a committee of the masterworkmen of the trade which he 
intends to enter. While the trade school separates the youth of the 
laboring classes into industrial groups, the sense of their community 
relations is developed by the lessons in citizenship (Biirgerkunde) 
which are common to all the schools. Thus every effort is put forth 
to establish close relations between the continuation trade schools 
and the living conditions into which the young workmen must enter. 
The continuation schools of Munich are in organic relation with the 
elementary schools; in Berlin they have been established independ- 
ently, and the compulsory principle was not applied to them until 
1906. One marked distinction between the trade continuation 
schools of the two cities pertains to the practical work. The trade 
schools in Munich are all equipped with workshops; whereas in Berlin   
1 From report by Dr. Gosling, of Cincinnati, member of the company sent from the United States to 
study the schools of Munich,
-P-A-G-E-778
  142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the trade training has been left to the employers, and the continuation 
schools have been limited to theoretic instruction. Experience indi- 
cates the superiority of the Munich system, and a movement for sup- 
plying the trade schools of Berlin with workshops has been started by 
the employers themselves. It is insisted, however, that distinction 
must be preserved between the school workshop (Schulwerkstatt) 
and the regular trade shop (Lehrwerkstatt). 
Berlin, with its 2,171,000 inhabitants (exclusive of the suburbs), 
maintains 10 continuation schools under the compulsory attendance 
law. These comprise 978 classes, with a total attendance in 1912 of 
34,319 pupils. Of the number, 355 classes with 13,725 pupils were 
for unskilled workers. The annual expenditure for these schools 
amounts to about $200,000, not including payment of loans and 
interest. The entire sum is supplied by the city. 
In 1912 there were 26,621 continuation schools in the German Em- 
pire, with an attendance of 1,342,825 pupils. Of the total number of 
schools, there were 16,535, with an enrollment of 591,516 (350,238 
boys, 241,278 girls) for general instruction. The remaining number 
were specialized trade schools, including 461 industrial schools for 
girls, with 32,406 pupils. 
TEACHER TRAINING. 
The desire for university opportunities on the part of teachers of 
elementary schools has gained official recognition in Saxony and in 
Bavaria. This success gives new impetus to the efforts of Prussian 
teachers in the same direction. They urge that the severe training 
required for admission to the position of teacher is not inferior in 
discipline to the Gymnasium course, and that at the same time it 
prepares student teachers for higher cultural studies pertaining to 
their profession. Their efforts are strengthened by the purpose of 
political and socialistic leaders to break down caste distinctions in the 
Kingdom. The question of the professional training of teachers, 
therefore, is related to one of the deepest movements of the age. 
The main requirements for elementary teachers are the same in all 
the German States. They comprise a preparatory course of two or 
three years, to which the pupil is admitted at 14 or 15 years of age, 
and which may be given in a separate school, as in Prussia, or in a 
department of the training seminary, as in Saxony. The student 
enters the seminary (normal school) at the age of 17 for three years 
of intensive work covering the history and theory of pedagogy, com- 
bined with practical teaching under the critical observation of the 
seminary director or a member of the faculty. Periodical examina- 
tions determine the student’s continuance in the seminary, and at the 
end of three years he is subject to a final examination which entitles 
him to a provisional certificate. Thus equipped, he begins his career
-P-A-G-E-779
  
  GERMANY. 743 
usually in an ungraded country school; after two to five years’ 
experience he is admitted to a second official examination. Its 
object is to ascertain whether or not the provisional teacher has 
acquired practical skill, and a deeper knowledge of educational prin- 
ciples. It gives the candidate also a chance to be tested in any 
subjects in which he was weak at the previous examination and thus 
to improve his position. This second examination comprises the 
following: 
(A) Written: 
(1) A subject of school management. 
(2) A religious or ethical subject. 
(3) A secular subject of instruction. 
(B) Practical teaching of a selected subject. 
(C) Oral examination in history, theory, and methods of education. 
This examination opens the way to higher posts in the elementary 
schools and to the position of assistant teacher in a Mittelschule. 
It follows that during the probationary term of service the German 
teacher has a great incentive to intellectual and professional develop- 
ment, and in every German State agencies have been provided for 
meeting this need. District libraries, educational museums, classes 
maintained by teachers’ associations, and vacation courses at the 
universities, all conduce to this end. This private study during the 
pressure of work increases the discontent of teachers at their exclusion 
from the universities, which would enable them to secure the coveted 
prize of a diploma. The special courses for teachers held at the uni- 
versities carry no sanction of this kind; even the privileges accorded 
at Leipzig and the universities of Bavaria are only within the reach 
of graduates from the normal schools who have passed their proba- 
tionary term as teachers and gained distinction in all their examina- 
tions. Practically the elementary school and the elementary school 
teacher do not come within the currents of influence that flow from 
the higher institutions. 
THE GERMAN TEACHERS’ MEETING AT KIEL. 
The annual meeting of the federated associations of German 
teachers (Deutsche Lehrerversammlung) was held in the city of 
Kiel, at Whitsuntide, 1914. 
The reported speeches of Dr. Seyfert are particularly interesting 
to Americans, because of their democratic tone, and because of their 
bearing upon the views of Dr. Kerschensteiner, which have had such 
a wide influence in the United States. Having come up through the 
common schools of his country to, the position of seminary director, 
the former is now known as the strongest exponent, in the German 
Teachers’ Association, of the idea of making pedagogy an independ- 
ent science.
-P-A-G-E-780
  
  744 — EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Dr. Seyfert began his discussion by asking the question: ‘Is there 
such a thing as a science of pedagogy?’’ The Bavarian University, 
in 1908, had declared, he said, that there is no such thing as an isolated 
science of pedagogy. This not only expresses the sentiment of 
German universities as a whole, said the speaker, but influences 
German scholarship to such an extent that those who are educated 
at the universities hear and know little about pedagogy. Further- 
more, this sentiment has hitherto kept the universities from estab- 
lishing chairs of pedagogy in connection with their other work. 
The day demands a deepening and widening of the education of the 
teacher, said Dr. Seyfert. Summing up this phase of the subject he 
said: 
The German Teachers’ Association and the science of pedagogy go hand in hand. 
Science is not a child to be left to stand alone. Science demands life; it works in 
connection with life and into life. * * * Pedagogy as a science must have life 
through which to realize itself. The German Teachers’ Association wishes to be 
scientific in all it does, and as a consequence asks to have its work put where it belongs. 
It would class pedagogy as a science and would place in our universities chairs of 
pedagogy. 
Dr. Seyfert combated the idea that the deepening and widening 
of the culture of teachers would cause them to lose sympathy with 
the common people. ‘‘If it is sarcastically asked,’ says Dr. Seyfert, 
“what has science to do with teaching children their A B C’s, or 
beating into their heads the multiplication tables?” the reply is that 
Germany has nothing to fear because its common-school teachers 
become cultured. He declared: 
What I contend for is that when the young teacher comes from the seminary he 
will take with him the capacity for working scientifically. Full scientific knowledge 
we can not give him; but we can give him the trend and spirit of scientific work, so 
that he can utilize it in all he does. Such a person, if forced to work without further 
help from any institution of learning, can now do so to advantage by using libraries, 
the scientific courses maintained by this association, and by taking advantage of our 
teachers’ institutes. 
After thespeech by Dr. Seyfert the association passed, unanimously, 
the following resolutions: 
The assembly of German teachers maintains the necessity of regarding the science 
of pedagogy as the center of the education of the teacher; and that pedagogy as an 
independent science should be known and acknowledged; furthermore, that pedagogic 
study be made accessible to teachers of all schools. 
The assembly regards the purpose of the German teachers’ association to be— 
1. An aid in pedagogic inquiry and in publishing the results of the work of teachers. 
2. To suggest and to organize pedagogic scientific work among the teachers them- 
selves, 
The aim of pedagogic efforts in the German Teachers’ Association should not be to 
form a union of persons of like pedagogic sympathies and convictions, but to lead to 
the participation of all the members of the association in pedagogic life.

THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The German system of public instruction owes its distinction 
mainly to the secondary schools, in which the directive classes of the 
nation are educated. The conviction, however, has been growing 
that the course of study and the methods characteristic of these 
schools do not accord with sound pedagogic principles and that they 
are detrimental to the health of the pupils. Complaint is made of 
the deadening ‘‘barracklike’’ drill, overcrowded programs, and the 
excessive emphasis upon classical studies. Notwithstanding the solid 
strength of the system, two innovations have resisted opposition and 
gained Government recognition. 
The normal secondary schools are of three types—the Gymnasium, 
the Realgymnasium, and the Oberrealschule—all of which are organ- 
ized in nine classes covering the ages 9 to 18 years. The three types 
are in a sense equal, as their graduates are admitted to the universi- 
ties on the same terms, excepting that those from the Oberrealschule 
are not prepared for the faculties of theology and philology. The 
“reform schools’’ differ from the normal types in respect to the 
language programs, as will be seen from the following statements: 
In the Gymnasium the pupils are required to take four foreign lan- 
guages: Latin, nine years; French, seven years; Greek, six years; 
Hebrew or English, three years. 
In the Realgymnasium three foreign languages are required: Latin, 
nine years; French, seven years; and English, six years. 
In the Oberrealschule two foreign languages are required: French, 
nine years, and English, six years. 
The ‘‘reformed Gymnasia’’ follow either the ‘‘Frankfurter system”’ 
or the ‘‘Altonaer system.’’ The distinction between the two is not 
great. Both differ from the normal Gymnasia in the plan of lan- 
guage studies. They start with French in the Sexta or lowest class. 
In the Frankfurter.system, at Untertertia, or lower third class, a 
division takes place into Gymnasium and Realgymnasium. For the 
former, Latin begins at Untertertia and Greek at Untersecunda 
(lower second). For the Realgymnasium, Latin also begins at 
Untertertia and English takes the place of Greek in Untersecunda. 
In the Altonaer system French begins at Sexta and English at 
Quarta. At Untertertia there is a division into the Realgymnasium 
with Latin and the Oberrealschule with French and English con- 
tinued throughout the remaining five years. 
These reform secondary schools have all the advantages of the 
normal types. At the end of the sixth year their pupils receive the 
certificate which allows the possessor to serve as an ‘‘Hinjihrig- 
Freiwilliger,” that is, as a volunteer for one year in the troop which 
he chooses, and at the completion of the nine years’ course the pupil
-P-A-G-E-782
   
    746 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
is admitted to the ‘‘Abiturienten-Examen,’’ which admits to the 
universities. | 
The secondary schools which have only a six years’ course also 
carry for their pupils the advantage of the one-year volunteer service. 
The latest statistics, which pertain to the year 1911, give a total 
of 306,426 students in the three classes of secondary schools having 
the full course of nine years. Of this total, 53 per cent were in the 
Gymnasia, or classical schools, and 47 per cent in the Realschulen. 
In the schools having only a course of six years a very large propor- 
tion of students, viz, 92 per cent, were in the two classes of Real- 
schulen. 
A very recent analysis of the statistics gives the number of the 
reform institutions as 184; of these, 158 are found in the several 
classes of Realschulen, which number altogether 1,082 institutions; 
of the Gymnasia and Progymnasia, numbering 605, only 26 follow 
the reform programs." 
SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR GIRLS. 
Secondary education for girls continues to excite earnest discus- 
sion in Germany, and more particularly in Prussia, where girls are 
not admitted to the secondary schools for boys, as they are in several 
German States. The higher schools for girls in Prussia, as organized 
under the regulations of 1908, do not offer the same courses of 
instruction as the secondary schools for boys (Gymnasia and Real- 
schulen), or, in other words, they do not prepare directly for admis- 
sion to the universities which were opened to women in 1908, the 
year of the so-called reform of the higher girls’ schools. 
Under the existing regulations the course of study for the “higher 
girls’ school’’ proper covers 10 years, of which 3 years are prepara- 
tory. After completing the full course, the student may enter upon 
any one of three courses known as Studienstalten, which lead to the 
Reifepriifung- Thus after 13 years’ study, including the prepara- 
tory course, pursued under great difficulties, as against the 12 years 
covered by the Vorschule and the Gymnasium for boys, a young 
woman may finish preparation for the university. Dissatisfaction 
with the condition is increased by the advanced requirements for 
the teachers of the higher girls’ schools. The associations of women 
wage a vigorous campaign against these unjust discriminations, in 
which they are supported by liberal-minded men. It is generally _ 
admitted that the reform of the higher girls’ school started by the 
regulations of 1908 must end in giving the women of Prussia equal 
scholastic opportunities with the men.

HIGHER EDUCATION. 
As this chapter goes to press announcement is received of the 
opening ceremony of the new university at Frankfort on the Main, 
which took place October 18, 1914. Although this event is later 
than the period covered by the present survey, it is the culmination 
of plans which took definite shape in 1912 and were so far advanced. 
at the beginning of the current year that it was expected students 
would be admitted for the summer term. : 
The total registration at the 121 German universities in the sum- 
mer semester of 1913 was 60,346 and at the 8 higher technical schools 
16,418 students. 
AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 
SYSTEM OF GENERAL EDUCATION. 
The educational system of the two divisions of the Austro-Hun- 
garian Monarchy, although distinct from each other, present many 
similar features. In both divisions of the country the progress of 
education, particularly as related to the masses of the people, is too 
involved with political and racial conditions for the full application 
of the principles embodied in the school law. The standards of sec- 
ondary and university education are practically the same as those of 
Germany, and systems of industrial and technical education are well 
developed in both divisions of the monarchy. 
ILLITERACY. 
Elementary education is compulsory by law in the two divisions 
of the dual monarchy. Nevertheless the degree of illiteracy is high 
in both. In Austria this appears to be largely the result of lax 
administration, and efforts have recently been made to increase 
school attendance in this Empire, or rather to correct the evils of 
irregular attendance and early withdrawal. In respect to the mere 
matter of school enrollment, the record is not bad, as compared with 
other countries. Thus in 1911 the enrollment in elementary schools 
was very nearly 16 per cent (15.9) of the population and 92 per cent 
of the children of school age (6 to 14). The ratio of illiterates to the 
population above 10 years of age ranges, however, from 60 in every 
1,000 inhabitants in the principal Provinces up to 736 in 1,000, 
reported for Dalmatia. These conditions are attributed to the indif- 
ference of local authorities, and the demand has become urgent that 
the State shall establish a vigorous supervision over clementary 
schools and at the same time assist the poorer districts by large 
appropriations for support.
-P-A-G-E-784
  748 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
As regards Hungary, the charge is made that the Magyars, the 
dominant race, while freely supporting higher education, are indiffer- 
ent to the education of the people, and further, that they exclude 
other races in the Kingdom from their full share in the educational 
provisions. The latter charge is apparently confirmed by official 
statistics. For instance, in 1911 there were 59 Magyar students in 
secondary schools (Gymnasia and Realschulen) for every 10,000 of 
that race. On the contrary the Roumanians, who in their own 
Kingdom are ambitious scholars, had only 14 students in the second- 
ary schools for every 10,000 of their people. Equal disparity is 
noticeable in other secondary and higher institutions, not only as 
regards the Roumanians, but all non-Magyar races within the borders 
of the Kingdom. 
Without considering further the bearing of these statistics, it is 
significant that the Hungarian census for 1910 gave 43.6 per cent of 
the population as illiterate. It should, however, be observed that 
the ratio had declined below that shown in the two preceding cen- 
suses; namely, 47.7 per cent, census of 1900; 54.5 per cent, census of 
1890. 
STATISTICS. 
From the statistics given below, it appears that the enrollment in 
elementary schools in Austria for the latest year, 1911-12, was equiva- 
lent to 16 per cent of the population (28,324,940, census of 1910). 
The corresponding statistics for Hungary give an enrollment in pri- 
mary schools in 1911-12 of 14 per cent of the population (20,886,487, 
census of 1910).

INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL TRAINING IN AUSTRIA. 
CENTRAL AGENCIES, 
Austria was one of the first countries in Europe to recognize the 
importance of the higher orders of technical instruction, the Royal 
Technical High School, established at Prague in 1806, and that of 
Vienna, established in 1815, being the oldest institutions of the class 
in Central Europe, and on the entire Continent preceded only by 
the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, created at Paris in 1794. 
The organization of ‘‘Realschulen,” or secondary schools having 
special reference to the preparation of young men for practical life, 
had been already authorized (1804); so that Austria was committed 
to the movement of modern education early in the nineteenth cen- 
tury. The downward extension of the movement, as measured by 
the number of secondary technical schools and industrial continuation 
schools, has been somewhat slower than in the neighboring nations 
of Germany and Switzerland. The difference is partly due to the 
more highly centralized control, with less local initiative, character- 
istic of Austria, and partly to the differences in race and language 
and industrial developments in different parts of the Empire. Under 
the system of centralized control, however, some important agencies 
have developed which are exceedingly helpful to all communities and 
to schools which provide either technical or industrial training. 
The ministry of public works, which has charge of industrial 
schools, maintains a bureau of school apparatus and equipments which 
in its practical effects is the most important of the central agencies.
-P-A-G-E-786
ee ee 
750 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Experts are employed by the bureau to examine all materials sub- 
mitted and test their utility for school use. The bureau itself also 
manufactures new apparatus, stimulates educational institutions to 
do the same by offering prizes for the approved products, provides 
traveling exhibits of apparatus and supplies, and organizes lecture 
courses on industrial subjects. 
School supplies are obtained for the bureau by purchase of models 
submitted for prizes and by the manufacture carried on at the bureau 
and in the workshops or studios of the State schools. The latter are 
under obligation to cooperate in the production of material for the 
bureau, so far as may be possible without interfering with their 
ordinary work. 
The activities of the bureau of apparatus and supplies are specialized 
through subdivisions as follows: Art-trades department; textile 
department; department for continuation schools; chemical-technical 
department; and an institution for teaching and investigating the 
graphic arts. 
The remaining central institutions include: The Austrian Museum 
of Art and Industry, with two affiliated industrial art schools; the 
Technological Industrial Museum, noted for the admirable classifica- 
tion of its specialized collections; and a group of institutions for 
teaching and research pertaining to leading industries—leather indus- 
try, art embroidery, lace work, basketmaking, and patternmaking. 
All the central institutions furnish models that are loaned upon 
application to State schools in different parts of the country, and 
the visits of teachers to these institutions is encouraged often by 
appropriations to defray their expenses. 
STATE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. 
The State industrial schools (Staatsgewerbeschulen) were created 
by decree of 1875. They comprise general industrial schools (Die 
allgemeine gewerbliche Schulen) and special schools for certain 
industries (Fachschulen). They number at present 16, of which the 
principal are 2 at Vienna and 1 at each of the following cities: Salz- 
burg, Gratz, Trieste, Innsbruck, and Prague. The school at Gratz, 
which may be taken as typical, has about 40 teachers and 300 
students. It comprises— 
I. School for overseers (Werkmeisterschule), with an industrial construction 
division having special schools for building industries, in the narrow sense, 
for carpenters, stonemasons, joiners, and for ironworkers, and also art-indus- 
trial division, with special schools, as follows: 
(a) School for decorative painters. 
(6) School for ceramics, for modelers, for pottery painting, etc. 
(c) School for wood industries, turners, cabinetmakers, wood carvers, etc. 
(d) For metal industries, chasers, engravers, decorative ironworkers. 
II. Special course for art embroidery. 
(The preceding are all both summer and winter subjects.) 
III. Drawing and modeling, in summer only.

APPRENTICE SCHOOLS OF HUNGARY. 
The system of industrial and technical education in Hungary 
comprises apprentice schools under the department of education 
and higher technical or trade schools under the department of 
commerce. 
The apprentice schools are either general or special in character. 
An important feature of the former is the course of “readings” 
intended to give the pupil knowledge of his own and other countries 
and to impart a sense of his duties and his relation to his environ- 
ment. The scope of the “readings” is shown by the following topics 
from the official syllabus: “Industrial life; geography, Hungarian 
history and legislation; public hygiene; political economy; physics; 
chemistry and technology. The character of these “readings” may 
be illustrated by the full outline under industrial life, which is as 
follows: 
Extracts from the lives of celebrated manufacturers, exhibiting the qualities 
demanded in a manufacturer (love of work, exactitude, honesty, sobriety, the spirit 
of economy, purity of morals, respect for the law, patriotism, a conciliatory character, 
the duties of the apprentice toward his master or guardian, rules of good behavior in 
the family, the school, and in public life). 
For each of the three years of the course the instructions empha- 
size the importance of selections from Hungarian literature bearing 
on the historical and geographical subjects. 
The remaining subjects of instruction in the apprentice schools 
pertain to the industries for which the students are preparing. The 
schools are maintained by a special tax, limited to 2 per cent of the 
school tax, and where this is not enough the deficiency is made good 
by State subsidies, disbursed by the minister of education. The 
school sessions cover seven hours a week, of which three fall on 
Sunday; trade apprentices are obliged to attend, and factory pro- 
prietors and masters of shops, etc., are liable to fines of 50 florins 
($22) for failure to send their apprentices to these schools. 
TRADE AND TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
The trade and technical schools are under the general direction 
of the ministry of commerce, and are distinguished from the appren- 
tice schools by a higher order of technical training and the higher 
attainment of their teachers. These must be graduates from the 
division of the polytechnic school—i. e., the engineering department, 
the department of architecture, or the department of practical 
chemistry, corresponding to the speciality over which the teacher 
may be placed. 
Many of the teachers are sent to schools in other countries for at 
least a year at the expense of the State or else they enter the univer-  
-P-A-G-E-788
  
  752 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
sity for studies relating to their specialties. In general, each teacher 
has three or four years of academic work, supplemented by a year of 
travel in foreign lands. 
The trade and technical schools pertain to many industries, includ- 
ing those for women, and hence differ widely with respect to the 
technical courses which they offer, although all include the same 
general instruction. This comprises— 
Hungarian, and its form in business and industry; arithmetic and geometry, with 
their applications; physics and chemistry, treated in a very general way, but experi- 
mentally illustrated; writing; industrial accountancy, dealing with the principles 
of cost, sale, profit and loss systems of bookkeeping as applied to industries. 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
Commercial education has received every encouragement in Hun- 
gary, which depends largely for its progress upon inland trade. 
The constant activity in this direction is illustrated by recent efforts 
to extend trade to the new Kingdom of Albania. For this purpose 
an exposition of articles manufactured in Hungary was opened at 
Valona, Albania, under the charge of the Hungarian Commercial 
Museum. In connection with the display, small booklets were dis- 
tributed describing, in the French and Albanian languages, all the 
samples, representing 220 different manufactures. The importance 
attached to this enterprise was indicated by the fact that Dr. Julius 
Kovacs, the director of the commercial museum, personally super- 
intended the arrangements of the exposition in Albania. An excur- 
sion of the leading business men of Albania to Budapest was also 
arranged, and every effort made to induce them to establish close 
relations with Hungarian manufacturers."

EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN SPAIN. 
The most stirring events in the recent history of Spain have arisen 
from the educational conflicts between progressive leaders and their 
political opponents. The latter have been weakened in the contest 
by the pressure of industrial needs, and gradually Government sup- 
port has been secured for reforms in the organization and conduct of 
primary schools throughout the Kingdom. The important feature 
of the new policies is the larger control of primary education assumed 
by the State. This action began by the creation of a ministry of 
education in 1900; in 1902 the State took over the payment: of 
teachers’ salaries, and provided also for the erection of school build- 
ings in cities or districts neglecting this duty; in 1909 a law was 
passed increasing the authority of the State in respect to the appoint- 
ment of teachers and the internal conduct of schools. Finally, in 
1911, a decree was passed creating the office of general director of 
primary education in the ministry. This office was committed to 
Dr. Altamira, widely known by his historic writings and his practical 
conduct of a university extension movement in the interests of artisans 
and laborers. 
The recent withdrawal of Sefior Altamira from the directorship of 
primary education has been the occasion for a review of the work 
accomplished during the three years of his administration. The 
interests of the teachers were his first concern, and he was successful 
in securing for them a general increase in salaries, more secure tenure, 
and promotion at fixed intervals. At the same time, he raised the 
standards of the service by the reorganization of the normal school 
programs, the creation of special courses of instruction for teachers 
in the service, and traveling scholarships for the purpose of enabling 
teachers to profit by tours of observation in foreign countries. Under 
his administration, the service of school inspection was placed on a 
higher plane as regards the qualifications of candidates, and a corps 
of inspectresses added to the force. Sixty circulating libraries for

154 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
the use of teachers were established, and finally primary education 
was made free by the suppression of school fees. The efforts of Dr. 
Altamira extended beyond the strictly educational features of the 
service; medical school inspection was extended and placed upon a 
firmer basis and provision made for school colonies for the benefit of 
delicate children. 
The reforms authorized by law have necessitated substantial 
increase in the public appropriation for primary education. In 1909 
the budget of the ministry of public instruction amounted to 
52,351,374 pesetas ($10,103,815); in 1911 this total was increased by 
6,173,212 pesetas ($1,191,430), and by successive increases the 
budget for 1913 reached the total of 62,711,373.06 pesetas 
($12,103,295). The greater part of this appropriation, and espe- 
cially of the increase, was applied to primary education. 
The effect of these efforts has been felt beyond the province of the 
schools; in many cities courses of instruction for adults have been 
held. with excellent results, which appear from the decline of illiter- 
acy. In 1900 statisties showed that 42 per cent of the population 
were unable to read and write. Recent military statistics give 35 
per cent as the ratio of illiteracy among the recruits. 
Great interest is also shown in provision for the education of women, 
an interest growing out of the successful operations of the well- 
known Institute for Girls, at Madrid. This institute is the out- 
growth of a mission school founded at Santander by the agency of 
Rev. William H. Gulick and his wife. The plan of a higher non- 
sectarian school for girls gradually took shape, and, without interfer- 
ence with the missionary work, was carried into effect at the capital 
city through the indefatigable efforts of Mrs. Gulick, supported by 
American philanthropy. The institute is under the general man- 
agement of a board of directors in the United States, and in 1912 was 
moved to the present site, on which a commodious building had been 
erected. The opening ceremonies in its new home took the form of 
a memorial service for its foundress, who died just at the completion 
of this last effort in behalf of the enterprise. 
Under the direction of Miss Susan D. Huntington, a graduate of 
Wellesley College, who had been connected with the work during 
Mrs. Gulick’s administration, the institute has fully sustained its 
efficiency and influence as an educational center. 
In close relation with the educational movement are the efforts for 
the improvement of agriculture and commercial affairs. The Govern- 
ment is taking an important part in the former by the establishment 
of experimental stations, where improved processes of agriculture 
are demonstrated for the benefit of the farming population. The 
commercial development is promoted, more generally, by munici- 
pal action. There is also a noticeable increase of provision for

EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN ITALY. 755 
scientific education. in the higher institutions, so that, both from the 
educational and industrial standpoint, Spain seems to be entering 
upon a new era of progress and prosperity. 
PORTUGAL, 
Portugal has entered with some vigor upon the effort to make 
adequate provision ef primary schools and to enforce the compulsory 
clause of the school law. For the latter purpose a special decree 
was issued by the Provisional Government under date of March 29, 
1911. Measures have also been adopted looking to the improve- 
ment of normal schools and the development of science courses in 
the universities. It need hardly be said that. the disturbed condi- 
tions of the country have not been favorable to the progress of these 
reforms. 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN ITALY. 
Recent educational progress in. Italy has been marked, as in Spain, 
by the increased activity of the Central Government in the province 
of primary education. In view of the fact. that the compulsory pro- 
vision of the education law was nullified in large parts of southern 
Italy by the want. of schoolhouses, an act was passed in. 1906 pledging 
18,000,000 lire ($3,600,000) for new buildings; in 1912-13 the 
appropriation for primary education was raised to 56,000,000 lire 
($10,800,000), which was more than double the corresponding sum 
for 1911. It was provided in the act confirming the increased appro- 
priation that four-fifths of the amount should be used to secure 
additional teachers and to raise the salaries of those in the service. 
A direct. effort to overcome illiteracy was made by an act of June 
4, 1911, transferring the control of primary schools to provincial 
authorities in the case of communes reporting more than 25 per cent 
of illiterates in their population. The actual result of these succes- 
sive measures can not be shown until the issuing of the next quin- 
quennial report, which should bring the data down to 1912-13. 
From current advices, however, it is certain that large gains have 
been. made in the number of schools and in their efficiency. 
Striking phases of the current. educational movement are the 
efforts to overcome adult illiteracy, and to prepare intending emi- 
grants for the unforeseen exigencies of travel and of the strange con- 
ditions in foreign lands. This latter enterprise, developed under the 
auspices of the commissioner of emigration, is one of the most impor- 
tant welfare activities of the present age.’

RURAL SCHOOLS FOR THE ROMAN CAMPAGNA, 
The provision of rural schools for the laborers of the great estates 
in the Roman Campagna is an enterprise of great interest in the 
midst of unusual conditions which are described as follows by a 
recent writer: : 
The laborers on the great estates of the Roman Campagna have been less in touch 
with the general movement of progress going on around them than those of almost any 
other part of Italy. Itisindeed difficult to realize the extreme loneliness of Campagna 
life; its primitive conditions are almost incredible unless one has had experience of 
them, and the railways and tram lines which cross the great plain in all directions still 
leave wide tracts of country untouched. There are very few permanent inhabitants 
in the Campagna, as malaria, until recent times, rendered it uninhabitable for several 
months of the year; although with the reclamation and improvement of the land the 
number of fixed settlers is increasing, the bulk of the labor is still performed by com- 
panies of guitti, as these peasants are called, who come down from their native villages 
in the Latian or Abruzzi Mountains every autumn, fix their temporary quarters in 
those hamlets of curiously shaped straw huts which may still be seen round the various 
casali or farmhouses, and return home in the summer. One result of this migratory 
existence is that the school system, which has been so much developed in Italy during 
the last decades, had just missed the Campagna guitti; for, while schools have been 
opened in their own native villages, they can not avail themselves of these facilities, 
as they are at home only in summer time when the schools are closed, and in the 
Campagna itself the municipality of Rome, under whose jurisdiction they dwell, does 
not provide for them save in a few cases, as they are not natives of the commune. 
Communications with Rome are generally too difficult for the laborers to be able to 
send their children to the city schools, and, moreover, each settlement is so small and 
so temporary that it would have been impossible to provide them all with regular 
municipal schools. The hut villages are fast disappearing and their place is being 
taken by more solid dwellings of brick or concrete, but the temporary nature of Cam- 
pagna farming has not passed away, and while it survives, the difficulty of providing 
the laborers with schooling remains. 
The effort to provide instruction for this migratory population was 
undertaken by a group of philanthropic persons who succeeded the 
first year (1906) in establishing four schools. Teachers were secured 
from the staff of the Roman elementary schools who, with great self- 
sacrifice, devoted Sundays and two or three evenings a week to the 
experiment. 
To quote again from the article referred to: 
The interest of public opinion in the scheme was gradually awakened; money was 
contributed by the State, the municipality of Rome, and private subscribers; and 
‘the number of schools and pupils increased year by year. Several of the landlords 
and farmers, especially the latter, were won over and made to realize that they could 
get better and more intelligent labor from educated peasants than from the wholly 
ignorant; a few, indeed, such as the lessees of Prince Borghese’s estate at Pantano 
Borghese, became quite enthusiastic over the work and granted every facility to the com- 
mittee and the teachers. In some villages special huts were erected in the same style 
as those inhabited by the guitti, but more solidly built and better kept, serving thus 
also as object lessons; or else wooden ‘‘docker” pavilions were set up, provided with 
all the necessary school furniture, and with wide shutters which when open enable

persons outside to follow the lessons as well as those within; in one or two spots disused 
railway cars were turned into classrooms. It also became possible to pay the teachers 
better, although the fees given were by no means proportionate to the great hardship 
entailed. It was very necessary that the Campagna schools should be easily shifted. 
from one spot to another, so as to follow the constantly shifting population, and in this 
the committee was successful. In one case a school changed its quarters four times 
in the course of a year, and every annual report mentions one or more schools as having 
been closed because there was no longer any population to provide for. In one Cam- 
pagna village, Colle di Fuori, below Rocca Priora, in the Alban Hills, which is inhab- 
ited by a fixed population who migrated years ago from Capranica, above Palestrina, 
and is better built than the others, a permanent schoolhouse of brick has been erected, 
most of the money and the labor being supplied by the peasants themselves. The 
building, which is surmounted by a small belfry for summoning the children to 
school and decorated by a frieze by a Roman artist, was inaugurated last year with 
great solemnity, a number of persons from Rome having been invited to attend the 
ceremony s0 as to arouse their interest in the committee’s work. 
In 1912, the number of schools had increased to 43, with 1,280 
pupils, and it was intended to open 58 schools during the winter of 
1913-14. Better arrangements have been made for conveying 
teachers to and from Rome, motor-car service having been estab- 
lished by the committee, by means of which the teachers are brought 
out in the morning or at the opening of schools and returned to their 
homes at the close. Naturally the teachers who engage in the service 
are among the most vigorous and enterprising in the city, and in 
addition to the usual subjects, they instruct in singing, nature study, 
notions of moral principles, hygiene, and cleanliness. The interest 
of parents is excited, and they are often to be seen seated beside the 
children going through the simpler lessons. Where there is no 
school, the parents demand that one should be opened. They look 
upon the committee and the teachers as their friends and advisers, 
and thus the whole character of Campagna life and agriculture is 
being transformed through the agency of the rural schools.t 
SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Italy is abundantly supplied with secondary schools, universities, 
and higher technical schools. Indeed, owing to local independence 
and ambition in this matter, the country suffers from an excess of 
institutions, which would be strengthened by reduction in some 
instances and closer coordination in others. 
The 21 universities include 17 which bear the designation ‘‘royal”’ 
and receive State subsid 4 are private foundations, that is, relig- 
ious institutions authorized by the civil powers. Repeated efforts 
have been made to reduce the number of royal or State universities, 
which exceed both the needs and the resources of the nation. As a

758 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
consequence, a few vigorous universities are found in the same class 
with a number of struggling institutions that are quite unable to 
maintain university standards and prestige. The condition has been 
the subject. of much discussion in the legislature, but.so far without 
result. Meanwhile, complaints have arisen that. the standards of 
secondary education are depressed as a consequence of the competi- 
tion for students on the part of the universities. These problems 
occupy at present the attention of the scholastic world and the opinion 
is generally expressed that their agitation is the preliminary to im- 
portant reforms in secondary and higher education. 
GREECE. 
At the breaking out. of the Balkan war, Greece had just entered 
upon. educational enterprises of great. promise. The awakened inter- 
est: in child welfare was indicated by the measures for enforcing the 
compulsory provisions of the education law, and by the passage of a 
bill (Session. of 1911-12) forbidding the employment of children under 
12 years of age in mills, factories, building operations, ete., and regu- 
lating the conditions under which children between 10 and 12 years 
of age might be employed by parents or guardians in harmless domes- 
tic industries. Women’s organizations were active in promoting 
these measures, as well as in plans for rural improvement, which were 
engaging public attention. Equal interest was shown in the move~ 
ment. for the higher education of women, having partieular regard 
to the growing demand for women teachers. 
The territorial changes and general disturbance due to the Balkan 
wars have hindered. the regular course of internal improvement in alk 
the countries. involved in the conflicts. In the case of Greece, how- 
ever, enlarged responsibilities are giving new motives for the renewal 
of efforts at social reform temporarily interrupted. 
The National University, at Athens, in the winter semester 1912-13 
registered 2,800 students and reported for that year expenditures 
amounting to $137,450. The Technical High School enrolled the 
same session 300 students and had an income equivalent to $400,000. 
The relations between the two institutions are very intimate, the’ 
same professors often conducting classes in both. 
THE BALKAN NATIONS. 
The nations that were combined together in 1912 in war against 
Turkey (first Balkan war) had new boundaries settled by the Treaty 
of London, which bears date May 30, 1913; Albania was recognized 
 
-P-A-G-E-795

as a distinct, principality, with a king nominated by the powers and 
accepted by the Albanians. Immediately war broke out among the 
allies (second Balkan war), which changed the new boundary lines 
(Treaty of Bucharest, signed Aug. 10, 1913). 
The latest information that has been received relative to the sys- 
tems of education in these countries was given in the Report of the 
Commissioner of Education for 1912 (Vol. I, pp. 575-577). Univer- 
sity statistics of later date are as follows:

TURKEY. 
At the close of the first Balkan war, Turkey retained only a narrow 
strip of territory on the European side of the Bosphorus, which was 
slightly extended as a result of the subsequent conflict between the 
allies. Convinced of the need of internal reforms, the attention of 
the Government was turned’ to the Asiatic Provinces, which com- 
prise an area exceeding 700,000 square miles, with a population of — 
more than 20,000,000, as against an area of 9,900 square miles 
and a population of 2,250,000 in the European division. For the 
development of the Asiatic territory, important plans were made, 
involving a loan of $155,000,000 in France in return for valuable 
concessions granted to French capitalists interested in the construc- 
tion of railways through some of the richest mining and agricultural 
regions. Other concessions were secured by German companies 
for irrigation works and by French companies for the improvement 
of ports. These projects for material development were accom- 
panied by measures for the reform of schools and for promoting sani- 
tary conditions in the chief cities. 
At Constantinople extensive improvements were undertaken, the 
buildings under contract at the beginning of 1914 including several 
- new schoolhouses. Similar activities were reported from the cities 
of Asia Minor. 
In regard to modern education, the dependence must necessarily 
be for some time upon foreign missionary agencies. The principal .

institutions under foreign auspices in the Turkish Empire were 
described in the previous Report of the Commissioner of Education.t 
They include, at Constantinople, Robert College and the American 
College for Girls, founded and maintained by Americans; and the 
Syrian Protestant College and the Catholic University of St. Joseph, 
which are centers of modern knowledge and liberal ideas at Beirut.

EXTENT AND POPULATION OF THE EMPIRE. 
The Russian Empire covers one-seventh of the land area of the 
globe and in 1912 comprised a population of 171,060,000, (estimates 
of the Central Statistical Commission). Russia in Europe, with an 
area less than one-fourth the total, has more than four-fifths of the 
population. The different divisions of European Russia vary in 
density of population from 1.4 to 419 inhabitants to a square mile, the 
average density being 69.2. The density of the Asiatic division of the 
Empire is only 4.1 inhabitants per square mile. Of the entire popu- 
lation more than half (92,000,000) are Slavs. Lithuanians number 
about 3,000,000, and other Aryans bring the total to 100,300,000. 
The Jews, who have played a very important part in the destinies of 
the Empire, number only 5,070,000; the Ural Altains comprise 
17,660,000, and the remainder are distributed between several races. 
Religion, which has been a determining factor in education through- 
out the Empire, has made for diversity rather than unity among the 
people. The established religion of the Empire is the Greco-Russian, 
officially called the Orthodox faith. The adherents of this church 
form 70 per cent of the entire population, Mohammedans follow with 
10.8 per cent, Roman Catholics 9 per cent, Protestants 5 per cent, and 
Jews 4 per cent. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
Under the conditions mentioned, the endeavor to establish a system 
of public instruction in Russia presents difficulties surpassing those 
that are encountered in any other nation of Europe. According to 
the most favorable estimates, the enrollment in elementary schools 
is only 34 per cent of the population, which is far below the propor- 
tion in other European nations, the range being from 14 to 18 per 
cent in the countries where elementary education is generally diffused. 
Finland, which differs entirely from the rest of the Russian Empire in 
respect to education and social progress, is not included in the 
present consideration.

SECONDARY AND HIGHER INSTITUTIONS. 
In Russia, as in other countries, education is more generally dif- 
fused in the cities than in the rural areas, and it is naturally more 
extended in scope, as the cities enjoy the direct influence of higher 
institutions. The student body who receive liberal or special educa- 
tion in the universities and higher technical schools rival those of the 
most advanced nations. Language, literature, science, and art are 
pursued with intense and passionate ardor by the intellectual classes. 
The following statement gives the enrollment in secondary and 
higher institutions at the lastest date reported: 
The secondary schools of Russia comprise several classes of insti- 
tutions under different authorities, those pertaining to the ministry 
of public instruction having the same classification as the correspond- 
ing schools of Germany. The latest official statistics, bearing date 
January 1, 1911, give a total of 124,555 pupils in the gymnasia and 
progymnasia for boys, and 67,230 in the ‘‘real schools.” The corre- 
sponding schools for girls, which offer generally a special course for 
teachers, enrolled at that time 259,079 pupils. The students in the 
secondary schools under other authorities enrolled 123,207 boys and 
50,761 girls, making a total enrollment in secondary schools of 624,832 
pupils, of whom 314,992 were boys. At the same time there was an 
estimated attendance at special schools for the blind, deaf and dumb, 
and in private schools, chiefly denominational, of about 816,000 pupils. 
Thus it appears that in 1911 there were 7,312,000 pupils in the primary 
and secondary schools of Russia (Finland not included). 
The 10 universities of Russia registered 36,147 students in 1912, 
and the six higher technical institutions about 10,000 students. 
APPROPRIATIONS FOR EDUCATION FOR 1911 AND 1912. 
The State appropriations for education in 1911 were as follows: 
Ministry of public instruction, 91,694,204 rubles ($47,222,410); other 
ministries for the support of schools, 13,269,204 rubles ($6,833 ,640)— 
total, 104,563,204 rubles ($56,056,050). The corresponding amounts 
for 1912 were: Ministry of public instruction, 114,436,072 rubles 
 
-P-A-G-E-799
  
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 763 
($58,934,577); other ministries, 17,289,039 rubles ($8,903,855)— 
. total, 131,725,111 rubles ($67,838,432). For elementary schools 
alone the ministry of public instruction in 1911 expended 46,083,000 
rubles, and the Holy Synod about 15,000,000, making a total of 
61,083,000 rubles ($31,457,745). The budget estimates for 1913 
included for educational purposes a total of 162,638,975 rubles 
($83,759,072), of which 67 per cent was assigned to the ministry of 
public instruction. 
MOVEMENTS AFFECTING THE PEASANT CLASS. 
The peasants, who form 75 per cent of the population of Russia, 
present both to sociologists and psychologists problems of absorbing 
interest. This vast body of the people have scarcely yet been 
touched by the agencies of formal education. At the same time by 
reason of their numbers and the economic importance of agriculture, 
the development of the peasants is a matter of great significance. 
Tts necessity was recognized by all thoughtful leaders in 1861, when 
serfdom was abolished, and it is emphasized by the agrarian revolu- 
tions that have marked the recent internal conflicts in the Empire. 
Hence the most important educational movements in Russia during 
the last few years are those directly relating to the peasantry. 
In the movement for the uplift of the rural population Russia is 
brought into the current of social progress which has spread through- 
out the civilized world; but in Russia the movement takes a direc- 
tion peculiar to that country. Everywhere else schools have been 
centers and effective agents in this movement, but in Russia the 
schools are wanting. Nor could the deficiency be overcome at once. 
A measure providing for universal compulsory education, debated 
in the first and second Dumas and adopted by the latter, was over- 
tuled as premature.!| The establishment of schools goes on, how- 
ever, and in some regions quite rapidly, through the action of local 
authorities and private individuals, philanthropists, landed proprie- 
tors, and captains of industry, moved by liberal impulses or economic 
forethought. 
In the absence of adequate provision for even elementary instruc- 
tion, the intellectual awakening of the peasant class has been pro- 
moted by political and social agitations. The reality and the outcome 
of these agitations are manifest in the internal upheavals that fol- 
lowed close upon the war with Japan, in the activities of the first and 
the second Duma, and in the peasant uprisings that have marked 
the revolutionary conflicts of the present decade. Apart from their 
excitation of individual minds, these upheavals have resulted in dis- 
tinct efforts at the reform of rural life and industry. All such efforts 
have, primarily, political and social aims rather than intellectual and

moral enlightenment; while these ulterior purposes do not belong to 
the present consideration, they should be mentioned, because at any 
moment they may interfere with the measures that are directly edu- 
cational, and prevent the results which from the standpoint of 
American experience would naturally be expected. It should also 
be considered that these measures are not national in their extent, 
but limited to particular communes or governments. 
Notwithstanding these restrictions, great significance attaches to 
the educational endeavors in behalf of the rural population, which are 
illustrated by the following examples drawn from authentic sources. 
GOVERNMENT AID FOR PEASANT FARMERS.! 
Among the poorer and more backward peasants the primitive wooden plow is still 
in use, and wooden harrows are often met with. In central Russia rye is cut with 
sickles; other cereal crops, as a rule, with scythes. Flails are used throughout the 
country, except in the south, where thrashing is done by means of stones dragged by 
horses, etc. 
Agricultural machinery was only introduced a few years ago, but is becoming 
popular, especially in the south and in western Siberia, where land is abundant and 
the peasants are well-to-do. 
The Government has organized experiment stations in various sections of the 
country, while the zemstvo offers assistance to the peasants through special instruc- 
tors and agronomists. 
AIDS TO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE CAUCASUS.” 
Considerable progress has been made in all branches of agriculture during recent 
years, and several important steps were taken in 1913 for its improvement. One of 
these was the appointment by the viceroy of the Caucasus, of a commission of lead- 
ing agriculturists who are to be assisted by Government specialists in all branches of 
agriculture. This commission is to assist communal and public bodies in dealing 
with agricultural questions and in promoting rural industries under the direction 
of the board of agriculture. The zemstvo agricultural organizations, under the 
guidance of provincial agriculturists, are to furnish advice to the farmers; district 
agriculturists, assisted by special instructors, are to attend to the needs of the various 
districts; and agricultural stations are to be established. 
It was recommended that meetings be held under the presidency of the provincial 
governors to discuss agricultural projects. A permanent agricultural commission 
has been proposed under ‘the presidency of the chief of the agricultural section of 
the Caucasus, to consist of representatives from the Tiflis botanical garden, the Cau- 
casus sericulture station, the board of agriculture, the zemstvo section of the offices 
of the viceroy, and other bodies. Projects for agricultural education include an 
agricultural section in the Tiflis Polytechnic Institute, special intermediate schools 
for agricultural instruction, and courses in agriculture in the elementary schools. 
The Caucasus board of agriculture granted about $500,000 in 1913 for the promo- 
tion of rural industries, an amount considerably larger than that granted in 1912. 
Of the total, $300,000 was set aside for research, $35,000 for agricultural organizations, 
$10,000 for the improvement of live stock, and $20,000 for general measures, such as 
exhibitions, meetings, statistics, and the destruction of harmful insects, : 
An important innovation was the establishment in September of a refrigerator-car 
service from different points in the Caucasus, as well as from Turkestan, for the con- 
veyance of fresh fruit and vegetables to northern Russia.

TOBACCO CROP AND PRICES—DEVELOPMENT OF TEA INDUSTRY.! 
The tobacco crop in the Caucasus in 1913 is estimated to have been between 14,000 
and 15,000 tons. The quality was better and prices from 30 to 50 per cent higher 
than in 1912. Prices for the Trebizond variety ranged from 14 to 26 cents a pound, 
and of the Samsun varieties from 20 to 50 centsa pound, The crop in Kuban Province 
amounted to only 4,800 tons, or about half the ordinary crop; but the quality and 
prices were good, the latter ranging from 6 to 17 cents a pound, or 30 to 50 per cent 
higher than in 1912. The crop in the Sukhum district was about 6,000 tons, a little 
less than in 1912. 
The greater part of the tobacco exported went to Egypt and the remainder to Ger- 
many, France, England, and the United States. Continental and Egyptian inter- 
ests are purchasing tobacco for manufacture abroad. 
The tea crop for 1913 was fairly good. The yield of raw leaf was 1,174,000 pounds 
and of manufactured tea 271,000 pounds, as compared with 999,000 and 242,000 
pounds, respectively, in 1912. In 1913 several acres were added to the area already 
under tea belonging to the imperial domains at Tchakva, and tea growing is becom- 
ing more general among private individuals. The agricultural society at Batum 
has decided to construct a tea factory just outside the town, to which tea that is 
grown in the surrounding districts will be brought for curing. The National Gov- 
ernment is assisting the tea industry by distributing plants and seeds in the tea-grow- 
ing zone and has granted $7,725 for construction work in connection with the factory. 
Funds have also been assigned for the tea factory that is under construction at 
Ozurgeti and an instructor has been appointed to manage the factory and instruct 
the rural population in the art of cultivating tea. 
Considerable attention is paid to public education in the Caucasus, and there was 
an increase during the year in the number of schools of all classes. Steps were also 
taken toward making attendance compulsory. One of the most interesting measures 
taken was an attempt to establish in the Government of Erivan two movable summer 
schools for the nomad tribes. Summer employment was also introduced in eight 
elementary schools of the Kutais government and in two schools of the Black Sea 
government. 
A site has been selected for the new polytechnic institute at Tiflis, and the building 
is to be erected in the near future. It has been decided to organize the institute in 
four sections—agricultural, chemical, mechanical, and economic. The building of 
the Caucasian museum and public library at Tiflis is in process of erection, and its 
completion is expected in 1914. It is of four stories and is to cost about $200,000. 
ENCOURAGEMENT TO PEASANT INDUSTRIES. 
In addition to the cultivation of the soil the peasants practice 
industrial arts which are utilized for their economic betterment. 
This is done largely through their local organization, which is con- 
trolled by a communal assembly (mir), composed of the householders 
of the community. These assemblies elect members to the dis- 
trict and provincial assemblies (zemstvos), and they have indirect 
representation in the Duma. The peasants also have special courts, 
which in certain matters have the right to follow local usages. It is 
true that the action of the communal assemblies and of the courts 
may be overruled by Government officials; but in spite of this 
restriction, the communal administration affords a center of coopera- 
tive action in respect to local matters.

    766 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
The important fact in respeet to the long-established peasant 
industries is the recent endeavor on the part ef provincial assemblies 
(@emstves) and the Central Government to organize and aid them. 
The first systematic effort in this direction was made by the Moscow 
zemstvo, which opened a museum in Moscow for the exhibit. of the 
products of these industries in 1885, and in 1888 organized a special 
commission to direct and extend the work. The help given is in the 
form of raw material, of instruction in the ways of finishing the 
articles manufactured, and of arrangements for facilitating the sale 
of the articles. This example was rapidly followed by other zemstvos, 
and in 1910 there were 34 governments that had organized. workshops 
for training the peasants and arranged for permanent. exhibitions and 
for the supply of the raw material to the peasant workers (koustari). 
The part of the Central Government in promoting this work is 
described as follows by the authority above quoted: 
The interests of the koustarnui industry are intrusted to the department of rural. 
economy and statistics of the ministry of agriculture. This department employs a 
special staff of experts in different branches of koustarnui work, has 12 technical 
schools managed by State instructors, lends money on long credit, subsidizes kous- 
tarnui stores and workshops, publishes albums of drawing and designs, organizes 
exhibitions, and helps to maintain the St. Petersburg Koustarnui Museum, started by 
the Government in 1900. Besides this, when the State gives orders for koustarnui 
goods, the department acts as intermediary between the zemstvos and the respective 
Government institutions, and further affords financial aid in exporting the products 
abroad. During the last five years the treasury has contributed over 3,300,000 rubles 
for the development of koustar (cottage) industries, the estimates for 1913 being 
1,647,000 rubles. 
With respect to these industries a well-known authority says: 
The position of the peasant in Russia, his well-being or his poverty, is largely due to 
the existence of the organized peasant industries. Far from being the most poverty- 
stricken agricultural class of Europe, his economic condition will stand comparison, 
within certain well-defined limits, with that of the tillers of the soil of the greater part 
of the continent. The natural tendencies of the great Russian people have made the 
existence of this organized industry possible. More than any other people they have 
the instinct for cooperative working, an instinct which has resulted in, and been 
fostered by, the institutions of the mir in the villages, and of the artel, or temporary 
voluntary associations of workmen, outside them. 
The most recent investigations seem to show that there are more than 8,000,000 of the 
inhabitants of European Russia whose time is shared between agriculture and some 
form of industrial handicraft, meaning by this term the production of some sort of 
merchandise for sale, not for use in the family of the producer; and about 4,000,000 or 
thereabouts whose whole time is engaged in handicrafts and small machine industries 
not grouped in the modern factory system. Where the wares produced are desirable 
and salable, the concomitant advantage of a healthy home life to the producer is a 
national asset. 
The number of these villages is almost unlimited, and as arule only 
one industry is pursued in each village; different provinces have 
become celebrated for the skill of the people in industries of the same 
general character, such as textile, industrial, metal working, pottery, 
etc.

REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
The report of the minister of public instruction in Japan brings the 
record of education in that Empire to the close of 1913, with compara- 
tive tables showing progress in the half decade. 
The system is marked by complete provision for primary educa- 
tion, thorough preparation of the teachers, and the high qualifications 
required for supervisory officers. The central department maintains 
close relations with the schools by means of annual conferences at the 
capital, to which selected teachers are called from every district, and 
by frequent conferences of the local inspectors. At these gatherings 
opinions and experiences are interchanged, instruction imparted, and 
new plans unfolded, and the delegates return to their duties with new 
enthusiasms and ideals. : 
In the provinces of secondary and higher education great care is 
exercised to limit the number of institutions, whether general or 
special in character, to the actual needs of the country, and to bring 
each institution to a high degree of efficiency. Quality rather than 
quantity is the aim. 
The minister urges special, efforts at moral and ethical instruction 
in every class of schools, primary, higher, and special, and empha- 
sizes the need by a letter from the Emperor, as follows: 
As the building up of a vigorous nation can only be effected through the diffusion of 
general education, those who are engaged in that effort should ever be assiduous and 
painstaking. 
Special attention is called in the report to recent extensions or 
changes in the official regulations for different classes of schools. In 
the higher primary schools, courses in manual training, agriculture, 
and commerce have been made obligatory, all pupils being obliged to 
take one or other of the subjects named. English, which was for- 
merly treated as an independent subject. has been included in the 
767

commercial course, with a view of making the instruction more 
practical. : 
The salaries of teachers have been raised and special rank con- 
ferred upon meritorious principals who have been over 20 years 
regular teachers of elementary schools. 
In the high schools for girls a course in household management has 
been substituted for the special art course, and authority given to 
establish high schools for girls which provide only an industrial course 
suited to their wants. In the regulations for normal schools, a course 
in ethics has been extended and strengthened. In the instructions 
pertaining to technical education, as well as to university education, 
new emphasis is placed upon the training of character, and provision 
has been made for increasing the equipment of all the higher institu- 
_tions. 
The following table summarizes the statistical data respecting 
schools and higher institutions for the years specified:

The expenditure for public schools of all grades below the univer- 
sities in 1911-12 amounted to 79,692,983 yen ($39,687,105), an 
increase of 3,000,000 yen over the preceding year. The appropria- 
tions for universities are included in the expenditures for the depart- 
ment of education, which amounted to an additional 10,448,331 yen 
($5,203,258). 
MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 
The system of modern education in China, ordered by imperial 
decree of September 5, 1905, has been continued by the Republic. 
The early efforts in this direction pertained chiefly to the establish-
-P-A-G-E-805
  
MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA, 769 
ment of higher institutions. The present minister of education 
places main stress on elementary schools and the training of teachers 
for their service, and, as a rule, the governors of the different Prov- 
inces seem to be giving hearty support to his plans. It is difficult, 
however, to form a clear idea of the progress in establishing the 
modern system, on account of the vast extent and local organiza- 
tion of the country, which consists of 18 Provinces having inde- 
pendent authority in respect to education, and comprising an area 
of one and one-half million square miles, with a population exceeding 
three hundred million. 
INSTITUTIONS UNDER PUBLIC CONTROL. 
Recent official statements give a total of 34 colleges, i. e., law, 
technical, etc., and six higher normal schools, established in various 
capital cities. The Peking Government University, an ancient 
literary high school, was organized as a modern institution about 
four years ago. The Government has agreed also to recognize the 
diplomas of the Union Medical College, founded at Peking by British 
missionaries. In the Province of Chihli a university has been estab- 
lished at Tientsin, and at Pao Ting-fu an Anglo-Chinese college. 
TSING HUA COLLEGE. 
One of the most important Government institutions is the Tsing 
Hua College, an outcome of the indemnity fund returned to China 
by the United States, amounting to $10,785,286. As a consequence 
of this liberal action, it was announced by the Government of China 
that— 
from the year when the return of the indemnity begins, 100 students shall be sent 
to America every year for four years, so that 400 students may be in America by the 
fourth year. From the fifth year and throughout the period of the indemnity pay- 
ments, a minimum of 50 students will be sent each year. 
Regulations were at once drawn up in accordance with this 
decision which, among other things, provided that ‘the Board of 
Foreign Affairs should be responsible for the establishment of a train- 
ing school in China and the appointment of the superintendent of 
students in America.” Specific directions for the choice of these 
students and their distribution in the United States were issued by 
the board, and plans were at once adopted for the establishment of 
a training school at Peking to prepare students for their work in the 
United States. This is the function of the Tsing Hua College, which 
is named from the beautiful estate selected for its site. 
The college was opened in 1911, but the revolution interrupted its 
work, and it was not until the spring of 1912 that operations were 
definitely resumed. The affairs of the college are administered by a 
73226°—xp 1914—vor 1——49
-P-A-G-E-806
  770 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
board, of which the president is Mr. Tsur Ye-Tsung, who has the 
degree of A. B. from Yale University and of M. A. from the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin. The dean of the institution is Mr. Chao Guo- 
Tsai, also a Wisconsin graduate. Of the eight remaining members 
of the administrative board, two are graduates of American uni- 
versities. 
The college is organized in two departments. The faculty of the 
Chinese department comprises 9 professors; the faculty of the West- 
ern department comprises 20 English professors, of whom 19 are 
American graduates, from leading institutions of this country; 2 of 
the number have also degrees from European universities; 1 is a 
native of China, holding the degree of A. B. (in education) from the 
University of Wisconsin and of M. A. in sociology from the Univer- 
sity of Chicago. The teaching corps includes, also, 7 instructors who 
are natives of China and graduates of foreign universities. 
The candidates for admission come from the various Provinces, the 
number from each Province being determined by the amount of the 
Boxer indemnity that falls to its share. The course of study in the 
middle school covers four years and leads to a certificate which 
admits the holder to the high school; the latter also has a four-year 
course. Students who complete this successfully receive a diploma, 
and may then be sent to the United States to pursue advanced 
studies under rules in force for a period of five years. The high- 
school graduates of 1913 numbered 43, and the class of 1914 had 34 
students. 
THE SCHOOL OF CONSERVANCY ENGINEERING. 
Under date of October 9, 1914, a presidential mandate was issued 
relative to the opening of a school of conservancy engineering in 
accordance with the advice of the minister of agriculture and com- 
merce. A fund equal to $20,000 was set aside for this purpose. 
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 
The educational movement is promoted by provincial educational 
associations, of which the Kiangsu Association may be taken as a 
type. It was organized in 1906 with headquarters at Shanghai, was 
sanctioned by the Chinese Emperor, and has been continued under 
the Republic with a revised constitution and rules. 
The unification of the educational work of the Provinces has been 
promoted by conferences of the local educational societies and by a 
national convention called by the Kiangsu Association. This con- 
vention, the first of its kind in China, met in 1911 in the office at 
Shanghai and included delegates from 11 Provinces. 
The general purposes of the association are furthered by the pub- 
lication of a monthly educational magazine which has very wide cir- 
 
-P-A-G-E-807
  
MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 771 
culation, and by bulletins, treating in a practical way of school 
problems. The association also maintains a ‘‘single grade’’ teachers’ 
institute which is modeled after a very successful institute of the same 
character in Japan. 4 
The school committee of the association was authorized by the 
Kiangsu provincial legislature to undertake the examination and 
approval of textbooks suitable for the modern schools. This work 
was begun in 1912; and in February, 1913, a report approving 55 
out of 180 textbooks examined was submitted, and the books were 
subsequently authorized for use by the civil governor of the Province. 
INSTITUTIONS UNDER FOREIGN AUSPICES. 
The International Institute of China was established at Shanghai 
about 20 years ago, for the purpose of promoting the general welfare 
of the country—moral, material, and political. It received imperial 
sanction in 1909, and under the present Government has increased 
its influence. 
The work of the institute is organized in four sections: Commer- 
cial, educational, religious, and the woman’s section. The funds for 
its support are derived from private sources. The director in chief 
is Dr. Gilbert Reid, who is assisted by an advisory committee and an 
executive committee, comprising both native and foreign members of 
distinction. 
The educational work of the institute is carried on chiefly through 
the medium of conferences and the museum. The latter comprises 
Chinese exhibits intended to illustrate the peaceful arts of the 
country. 
The conferences are arranged for by the different sections of the 
institute and relate to the specialties promoted by each section. 
Among the educational conferences held during 1913 was a series on 
national heroes, also two addresses relating to constitutional govern- 
ment, an address on education and religion by Dr. W. H. Faunce, 
president of Brown University, an address on the Hongkong Univer- 
sity by its president, Sir Charles Eliot, and one on social legislation 
by Prof. Henderson, of the University of Chicago. 
The woman’s section of the institute works in intimate relation 
with the Ladies’ International Club, and is specially engaged in pro- 
moting the advancement of women and the welfare of children. 
YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. 
China has proved a favorable field for the activities of the Young 
Men’s Christian Association, which is contributing in many ways to 
promote the modern educational movement. The work of the asso-

ciation is directed by a national committee, on which all the local 
associations in the country are represented. The headquarters of 
this committee are at Shanghai, where it will soon occupy a building 
of its own. 
In a recent survey of its operations the national committee empha- 
sizes the following particulars: 
The successful work of the Shanghai Young Men’s Christian Association in estab- 
lishing and maintaining a day school and an evening school with a total enrollment 
of over a thousand students demonstrates once more the eagerness of boys and young 
men for knowledge and culture. Through the medium of these schools the associa- 
tion comes into touch with the future leaders of the country along the various walks 
of life. Not only they themselves come within the Christian atmosphere of the 
association, but through them their homes are also reached. 
Among the agencies for popular education maintained by the asso- 
ciation, mentioned in the survey, are correspondence classes, vacation 
schools, general welfare work, and university extension carried on 
by lectures, exhibits, exhibition cars, etc. 
The great interest manifested by the Chinese people in scientific 
lectures has led to somewhat extensive provision for illustrating topics, 
both by pictures and apparatus.* 
  . MISSION SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. 
Catholic and Protestant mission schools and colleges are found 
at all principal ports and many interior cities of China. A recent 
report of these schools gives the following summary:

CHINESE INDEMNITY STUDENTS. 
According to the Chinese Educational Mission, there were 250 
Chinese students in the United States in 1914 maintained from the 
indemnity fund:

INDIA. 
THE SIXTH QUINQUENNIAL REVIEW. 
The endeavor to establish systems of modern education in India 
is a work of great magnitude, extending over an area of more than a 
million square miles, pertaining to a population of 225 millions, and 
maintained, at present, at an annual expenditure of 254 million 
dollars. ' 
The sixth quinquennial review of education in British India, just 
issued, covers in detail the period 1907-1912, and in a brief intro- 
ductory statement outlines the educational policy of the Government. 
The spirit with which the new era opens was expressed in the reply 
of the British King to the address of the Calcutta University in 1912, 
during his visit to his eastern empire. On this occasion His Majesty 
said: 
It is my wish that there may be spread over the land a network of schools and 
colleges, from which will go forth loyal and manly and useful citizens, able to hold 
their own in industries and agriculture and all the vocations in life. And it is my 
wish, too, that the homes of my Indian subjects may be brightened and their labor

    74 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
sweetened by the spread of knowledge with all that follows in its train—a higher level 
of thought, of comfort, and of health. It is through education that my wish will be 
fulfilled, and the cause of education in India will ever be very close to my heart. 
The principal departure in the general administration of the system 
is the appropriation of large grants from imperial revenues to assist 
the several Provinces in the development of their systems of educa- 
tion. These funds are to be managed in the spirit of economy, but 
without any purpose of centralizing control of the systems or 
establishing ‘a superficial uniformity.” The cardinal principles of 
the policy to be pursued, as set forth in the report, are, briefly, the 
steady raising of the standard of existing institutions; the direction 
of primary and secondary education to more practical ends than 
heretofore, by means of ‘‘manual training, gardening, outdoor ob- 
servation, practical teaching of geography, school excursions, organ- 
ized tours of instruction”; “ provision for higher studies and research 
in India, so that Indian students may possess every facility for higher 
work without having to go abroad.” It is agreed by the General 
Government and the provincial governments that the time has not 
come when the-principle of compulsory education can be applied: in 
India, or elementary education be made entirely free. Local govern- 
ments are urged to extend free elementary education among the 
poorer and more backward sections of the population. More than 
this is not possible at present. 
The hope is expressed that in the near future at least 91,000 pri- 
mary public schools for boys will be added to the 100,000 now in 
operation, and the number of their pupils, which is at present four 
and one-half millions, doubled. Vernacular continuation schools, 
which prepare pupils for entrance to more advanced studies that do 
not demand acquaintance with a foreign language, have increased 
during the last decade from 2,135 to 2,666, and the number of their 
pupils from 177,000 to 257,000. ‘The report dwells upon the impor- 
tance of the schools of this class, and urges that an advanced vernacu- 
lar course shall be provided at selected centers to prepare students 
for teaching in these continuation schools. Attention is called to the 
fact that— 
in some Provinces special classes have been opened in secondary English schools for 
scholars who have been through the whole course at a vernacular continuation school, 
in order to enable them to make up ground in English. There is much experience to 
the effect that scholars who have been through a complete vernacular course are excep- 
tionally efficient mentally. 
The number of girls under instruction has doubled in a decade and 
is now about 870,000. Although this number is insignificant in pro- 
portion to the female population, there are indications in many areas 
“of a swiftly growing demand for a more extensive education of 
girls.”’

While placing great stress upon the importance and extension of 
primary education, the report deals comprehensively with the higher 
institutions, and emphasizes the need of technical education. In this: 
connection, attention is called to the system of scholarships tenable 
in Europe and America. This system, it is agreed, is still on trial, 
and its recognized disadvantages furnish new motives for increasing 
the facilities for technical instruction in the Provinces. Attention is 
called to the Indian Institute of Science, established at Bangalore 
through the generosity of the Tata family, seconded by liberal aid 
from the Government of India and the Maharaja of Mysore. The 
institution was thrown open to pupils in 1911. The establishment 
of a Technological Institute at Cawnpore for the chemistry of sugar 
manufacture and leather, for textiles and for acids and alkalis, has 
been sanctioned, and funds have been appropriated for the purpose. 
The following tables summarize salient particulars respecting the 
different classes of institutions comprised in the systems with which 
the report deals: "

PROGRESS IN EGYPT. 
The advance of modern education in Africa necessarily follows the 
course of European colonization and commercial developments. 
Under French rule Algeria has become a separate division of the 
French system, conforming to it so far as possible in the organization 
of schools and scholastic standards. 
In Egypt modern education is the product of missionary enter- 
prise and of the efforts of the two European powers, France and 
England, that have exercised chief influence in the government. In 
respect to internal developments and the organization of schools the 
country has made remarkable progress since the British influence 
became supreme. The ancient village schools have been developed 
by State aid, and the Government supports 30 model primary schools 
which prepare students for admission to minor posts in the civil 
service. In the chief cities secondary schools, organized under 
Government auspices, offer a four years’ course preparing students 
for admission to intermediate civil posts and also to the colleges of 
law, medicine, and engineering at Cairo. These higher colleges and 
the secondary schools are largely staffed by English teachers. Schools 
of commerce and engineering are numerous, and compare favorably 
with European institutions of the same order. An important phase 
of the recent development is the increased provision made for the 
education of girls and the interest in this effort excited among the 
native population. 
Plans for the endowment and organization of a Christian university 
at Cairo, Egypt, have been recently formed in the United States and 
a board of trustees appointed to work out the details of the institu- 
tion. At a preliminary meeting of this board, held in New York, 
December 1, 1914, the Rev. Dr. J. R. McClurkin, pastor of the 
Shadyside United Presbyterian Church of Pittsburgh, was elected 
president. The scholastic organization as outlined at the meeting 
includes a collegiate department and a graduate school with courses 
in Arabic literature and history, Islamic theology and criticism, 
biblical archeology, political science, education, Christian apolo- 
getics, agriculture, engineering, law, and journalism. It was an- 
nounced by the trustees that subscriptions to the amount of $200,000 
had been obtained and that measures were in progress for raising the 
fund to $2,000,000. The university will not be sectarian. It is 
intended to draw students not only from schools in Egypt, but from 
the entire Moslem world.

THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA, 777 
THE COAST REGIONS. 
The coast regions of Africa, both on the eastern and western bor- 
ders, are comprised in what have been termed ‘spheres of influence,” 
chiefly French or German. In all the French divisions, schools have 
been established at the centers of administration. The island of 
Madagascar, on the eastern coast of Africa, which has been a French 
colony since i896, has a complete system of education, gratuitous 
and compulsory as regards the elementary stage. 
THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA, 
The Union of South Africa was constituted by an,act of 1909, 
which became effective May 31, 1910. Each of the four colonies 
comprised in this federation had a system of education well developed 
before the union, and the independence of these separate systems 
was guaranteed by the act, for a period of five years. Meanwhile, 
the entire subject was committed to a commission of investigation 
in order that measures, which might be adopted at the close of that 
period, should be determined in full view of the needs and possibili- 
ties of the separate provinces. The principal points in the report of 
the commission were presented in the annual report of this bureau 
for 1912 (Vol. I, pp. 602-604). 
The effect of the union has been to stimulate educational activity 
in all the provinces, and as regards the white population, the pro- 
vision of schools compares favorably with that in European countries 
generally.' 
One of the most important problems resting upon the present 
Government is that of the training and education of the native races 
and the colored people, including the children of mixed parentage. 
Peculiar difficulties are experienced from the fact that separate schools 
must be maintained for the white and colored children, and a third 
class for the contingent of East Indians in the several colonies. At 
present, while Government schools are maintained for the non- 
European children, the chief dependence for their instruction is upon 
mission schools. 
The twenty-sixth annual conference of the South African Teach- 
ers’ Association was held at Graaff-Reinet in June of the present 
year. The address of the president, Mr. C. A. Organ, was a forceful 
appeal for the establishment of continuation schools, with compul- 
sory attendance provisions. The interesting fact was brought out 
in this address that compulsory school attendance has been estab- 
lished for the ages 7 to 14, unless exemption is secured by passing

an examination in the studies of the fourth grade. From the ages 
of 17 to 21, boys are obliged to serve in the Active Citizens Force 
(Defense Act). This leaves the period from 14 to 17 free from all 
restraints of general discipline or professional guidance, the period 
when compulsory continuation schools are expected to do their effec- 
tive work. 
Mr. Organ urged that the upper limit exemption for children in 
the day schools should be raised to the age of 15; that continuation 
schools should be gradually provided for boys and girls and placed 
under the central department; and that statutory power should be 
given local authorities to enforce attendance from the age of 15 to 17. 
The institutions of higher education under the central department 
include the University of the Cape of Good Hope, which is an exam- 
ining body, a group of seven colleges which prepare students for uni- 
versity degrees, and the South African School of Mines and Technology, 
situated at Johannesburg. A special commission was appointed to 
consider the needs and interests of higher education, and the current 
year has been marked by the issue of the report of that body. . This 
document gives a detailed history of the inception and growth of 
the colleges and outlines a scheme for their federation in two groups, 
affiliated respectively to two universities, one in the south and the 
other in the north. These institutions, if the scheme is adopted, 
will take the place of the existing university at Cape Town.

EDUCATION IN AUSTRALASIA. 
  
ConTENTS.—The Commonwealth of Australia: Current activities—Medical inspection of schools—See- 
ondary education. New Zealand: Evidence of progress—Statistical summary. 
AUSTRALIA. 
CURRENT ACTIVITIES. 
In accordance with the constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Australia, adopted July 9, 1900, education remains as it was prior to 
that event, under the independent control of the individual States. 
Nevertheless, the union has had the effect of exciting friendly emula- 
tion in respect to public provision for education, while efforts in this 
direction during the past decade have been greatly stimulated by the 
increased influence of the Labor Party both in political and social 
affairs. 
The reports of commissions recently appointed in New South 
Wales and in the neighboring colony of New Zealand, to investigate 
education in foreign countries and advise as to needed reforms at 
home, excited attention throughout Australia, and have already 
resulted in laws or practical measures for the improvement of the 
school systems. Current educational movements in Australia, there- 
fore, as set forth in official reports, offer many points of interest. 
Among important recent developments are those pertaining to ad- 
ministrative services. In Victoria the education act of 1910 provided 
for a council of education, acting as an advisory board to the minister. 
In accordance with the advice of the council a system of inspection 
of registered ‘private schools was adopted the present year. All the 
important private schools are registered, by reason of the privilege 
accorded to their teachers of securing a place on the State list, if they 
have obtained State certificates. This they generally do, as it enables 
them to offer pupils as candidates for public scholarships. In this 
way Victoria preserves the “liberty of teaching,” while at the same 
time guarding against the increase of irresponsible teachers. 
In South Australia “boards of advice” have been founded in the 
school districts, half the members of which are elected by the parents. 
Thus the lively interest of citizens is awakened in the school condi- 
tions and at the same time cordial sympathies grow up between them 
and the officers and teachers engaged in the work. Current reports 
779
-P-A-G-E-816
    780 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
abound in illustrations of the practical activities of these boards. 
Their attention is drawn to details that generally escape a purely 
official board. The chairman of one district board names the follow- 
ing among many conditions that have been reported for attention: 
Need of new piping for the cooking stove in the teacher’s residence and 
for the heating stove in the classroom; the provision of a room for 
the private use of the head teacher; the action of a head teacher in 
inducing the parents of the school children to contribute half the cost 
toward installing wire doors and screens for windows, thus preventing 
flies from entering the classroom; the want of sanitary conditions, 
especially in the outbuildings of the school. 
By the extension of the upper age limit of compulsory attendance 
from 12 to 14 years of age in Queensland (act of 1910), the period has 
been made uniform (ages 6 to 14) in all the States, excepting Western 
Australia and Tasmania, where it is 7 to 13. The necessity of enforc- 
ing the compulsory laws has led to various expedients for reaching 
school children in country districts. Among these expedients are 
house-to-house schools and itinerant teachers, conveyance of children 
to central schools, and subsidized private or home schools. The 
compulsory laws are in a measure also the cause of the general dispo- 
sition to improve school buildings. The current reports contain many 
illustrations showing in contrast the old buildings and the modern 
ones by which they are replaced. This change is taking place not in 
cities only, but in rural districts as well. Among new types of school 
buildings in New South Wales are portable classrooms, which are built 
in sections and erected temporarily to relieve congestion in large 
schools, and buildings for small country schools in exceptionally hot 
districts, specially designed with verandas on all sides but the south, 
The compulsory requirements have stimulated movements for 
extending elementary education by means of higher classes and con- 
tinuation schools to which is imparted a vocational tendency. 
The evening schools in New South Wales were recently organized 
as vocational schools with a two years’ course, and placed under the 
charge of Mr. S. H. Smith, who is known both in Europe and America 
as an authority on this subject. In his report for 1913, Mr. Smith 
states that, out of a total of 5,829 pupils, only 373 completed the 
course, and of these more than one-half came from one school. He 
regards the results as disappointing, but expresses the hope of 
improvement in the future, in view of the increased efforts to keep 
the pupils for the full term and also from the fact that a large pro- 
portion of the pupils recently enrolled have come directly from day- 
school classes. He says: 
It is easier to get in touch, for his educational good, with the lad who has just left 
day school than with one who has just become subject to the contaminating influences 
of street companionship for three or four months. 
 
-P-A-G-E-817
AUSTRALIA, 781 
In his opinion, however, there is only one effective solution of the 
problem; namely, that of compulsory attendance upon the continua- 
tion school. He urges that— 
The State should step in to regulate the relation of the youth to his employer (just 
as, in an earlier epoch, trade guilds regulated the relationship of apprentice and 
master), by forbidding the employment of young people for such hours as shall make 
it impracticable for them to continue their education. * * * To the Parliament 
of the neighboring State of Queensland belongs credit of passing the first Australian 
compulsory continuation school attendance act. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS. 
Every State of the Commonwealth has provided for the medical 
inspection and supervision of children attending public schools; the 
majority have organized a special service for this matter in the 
education department. 
The work was begun in Tasmania in 1906 with the examination of 
1,200 children attending schools in the town of Hobart. Individual 
examinations of school children have since been made on a more or 
less extensive scale in the different States, and Australia, therefore, 
has an accumulated mass of records which are of value to experts in 
vital statistics as well as to directors of health service. In Western 
Australia by an act of 1911, medical school inspection was committed 
to officers of the health department; in South Australia provision 
was made in the estimates of 1913 for a special force, comprising a 
physician, a dentist, and two trained nurses to be employed entirely 
in the schools. 
With respect to this service, the minister of public instruction in 
New South Wales, in his latest report, says: 
One of the most important educational developments during 1913 was the reorganiza- 
tion of the scheme of school medical inspection, so as to embrace every pupil in the 
State whose parents desired such medical inspection of their children. Toward the 
middle of the year it was decided to dispense with the services of the part-time doctors 
previcusly employed by the department and to increase the medical staff so as to 
permit every pupil attending the public schools being examined at least twice during 
school life, that is, between the agesof6and 14. Later in the year medical inspection 
was extended to such private schvols as made application. With few exceptions, all 
school pupils in the State will now be subjected to medical inspection. Itis estimated 
that, approximately, out of 310,000 children attending school, 300,000 will be sub- 
jected to medical inspection. The medical staff of the department is now a self- 
contained branch, under the control of Dr. C. S. Willis, and the staff consists of 10 
doctors and 5 nurses. 
A bacteriological laboratory was established for this department in 
1913, and it was proposed to institute a traveling hospital during the 
present year, in order that medical treatment may be extended to 
pupils in outlying districts that are beyond the reach of either hospital 
or doctor, and to establish a central dental clinic at which county and 
city Pe may receive needed treatment.
-P-A-G-E-818
  782 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
Among auxiliary agencies growing out of the medical service are 
systematic courses of instruction in anatomy, physiology, and hygiene 
given at the Women’s Training College, Sydney; the following up of 
particular cases by nurses at the homes of children; and lectures to 
the senior girls in public schools on the care of children, home nursing, 
hygiene, etc. Similar extensions of the service are reported from 
Victoria and Queensland. . 
An important outcome of the medical service is the increased regard 
to conditions that promote health. This is indicated by the provision 
of open-air schools, city playgrounds for children, and camp schools 
for city boys. 
The minister of public instruction for Victoria reports that two 
open-air pavilions have already been constructed and two others are 
in course of erection, all at different centers. A site has also been 
purchased for an open-air school at Blackburn, intended for underfed 
children. They will be selected from the poorer industrial suburbs 
and recommended for admission by medical officers. 
At Hobart, Tasmania, two open-air classrooms were opened in 
1913. The minister of education says with respect to them: 
The cost is less than one-third of the ordinary classroom. The buildings are of 
wood and, in other States, both teachers and pupils have expressed a preference for 
the open-air school over the more solid structure, both for winter and summer use. 
The side walls are built up to a height of 3 feet 6 inches and are fitted with canvas 
slides working on ball bearings; these can be easily opened or closed at will. Should 
the building prove too cold for winter use, it will be utilized as a weather shed. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
While primary education and university education are under 
Government control in all the States of Australia, secondary schools 
have been largely left to private agencies. There is, however, a 
noticeable tendency in all the States to extend Government super- 
vision to schools of this class and to bring them within the reach of 
the people at large by means of scholarship funds. Interesting experi- 
ments in this department of education are reported as follows: In 
New South Wales a leaving examination has been instituted to mark 
the completion of the four years’ secondary course. In connection 
with this measure the university amendment act of 1912 provided 
for the allotment of the university senate in 1913 of 100 “exhibitions” 
to be awarded on the results of the leaving certificate examination. 
The examination was held November 24, 1913, and the successful 
students took up their university studies at the beginning of the fall 
termin 1914. This event marks the “definite linking up of the public 
school system with the university.” 
In Victoria the continuation schools have been converted into dis- 
trict high schools, and with the agricultural high schools offer very
-P-A-G-E-819
  
AUSTRALIA, 783 
complete provision for the continued education of children in the 
rural districts. The official course of study for these schools is 
arranged for a period of four years, which may be extended if neces- 
sary. For the first two years the pupils pursue the same studies, 
except those at the industrial schools. At the end of the two years 
the common course is replaced by four special courses, as follows: 
(1) A preparatory professional course for pupils intending to proceed to university 
studies, to enter the teaching profession, or to obtain a sound general education; 
(2) an agricultural course to be taken in agricultural high schools; (3) a commercial 
course for pupils desirous of entering upon commercial pursuits; and (4) a domestic 
arts course, designed to give girls a thorcugh training in domestic duties and in the 
“management of the home, as well as a good general education. 
For admission to the high schools pupils must be not less than 12 
years of age and must possess the qualifying certificate showing 
completion of the primary course; a declaration must also be made 
by the parents of candidates to the effect that they will keep their 
children in school through the four years of the course. 
In Queensland an important experiment was inaugurated in 1912 
when free high schools were opened in six centers. The curriculum 
for the schools, prepared in consultation with university professors, 
comprises three courses of study, each of four years’ duration. The 
general course will lead up to the university; the two remaining 
courses are characterized as commercial and domestic, the latter 
having special reference to the needs of young women. Queensland 
also makes provision for free secondary education by subsidies to 
private “grammar schools,’ supplemented by district scholarships. 
Under this arrangement each one of the 10 grammar schools offers 
free education for 50 pupils and submits to Government inspection. 
The free high schools were established in centers not provided with 
grammar schools, but the demand for similar provision has become 
general, and is persistently urged in Brisbane. As a consequence the 
question of secondary education and its relation to the State is vig- 
oronsly discussed. The secretary for education expresses the opinion 
that at present the Government is not prepared to meet the necessary 
expenditure for the general provision of free high schools. 
In Tasmania arrangements have been made by which pupils in the 
primary schools who pass a required test may be admitted to the 
high school without payment of fees; the minister of education advises 
that scholarship funds carrying a living allowance be provided as a 
means of bringing the opportunity thus offered within the roach of 
promising pupils in the country schools who, without such aid, could 
not continue their education.  
-P-A-G-E-820
    784 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914, 
NEW ZEALAND. 
EVIDENCES OF PROGRESS. 
The latest report of the minister of education shows that New 
Zealand is maintaining in every respect the high standards and the 
progressive spirit that have long characterized the educational work 
of that colony. The enrollment in public primary schools for 1913 
was 169,492, an increase of 3.5 per cent over the previous year and - 
equivalent to 16.3 per cent of the population, exclusive of aborigines. 
On this enrollment an average attendance of 89.2 per cent was main- 
tained, which places New Zealand in the very first rank in respect to 
this important particular. The enrollment in private primary schools 
and lower departments of secondary schools would raise the total 
enrollment to 17.7 per cent of the population and would not materially 
lower the ratio of attendance, since the private schools are also under 
State inspection and receive subsidies from the public treasury based 
upon the inspectors’ reports. 
With regard to the public schools, it is noticeable that a compara- 
tively large proportion of the pupils reach the sixth grade. The 
compulsory school age is from 7 to 14, but children can be admitted 
into school at 5 years of age. The statistics show that the largest 
proportion of the pupils attending school at any given time are 8 or 
9 years of age. For 1913, the attendance of children.of the former age 
was 20,269, nearly all of whom were either in standards 1 or 2; but 
the total number in the fifth standard was 15,435, and in the sixth 
standard 10,373, the latter being about half the number in the second 
standard. Not only is the compulsory law well enforced, but children 
under 14 can not get exemption from school attendance unless they 
are able to pass certain examinations; hence there is every induce- 
ment for them to remain in school, whether they are pupils of public 
or private institutions. 
From tables showing the number of pupils to a teacher in the 
several grades of the primary schools, it appears that in the lowest 
grade (preparatory or infants) each teacher has a little over 9 pupils; 
in grades 2 and 8 (single-teacher schools), 23 pupils; grades 4 to 10 
(two or more teachers), 33.8 pupils; grades 7 to 10 (over 200, with 
six or more teachers), 47.6; in all schools, 32.8. In these estimates 
two pupil teachers are counted as equivalent to one adult teacher. It 
is believed that the new scale of staffing adopted by the education 
act of 1914 will tend to diminish still further the evil of overcrowded 
classes. 
Children who live remote from schools are furnished with convey- 
ance at public expense, either by rail, by water, or by carriage road, 
and where this means fails, children are boarded at public expense near

the school. The amount paid by the State to education boards for 
these purposes in 1913-14 was £18,837 ($94,185). 
Attention is called to the fact that in 1913, of 5,190 teachers em- 
ployed, 963 were men and 3,227 women. In thesmallest rural schools 
(1 to 15 pupils) the proportion was 349 women to 100 men. On this 
subject the report says: 
The large proportion of female teachers to males in schools of 1 to 15 pupils is 
readily explained, the maximum salary (£120) in these schools being too small to 
attract male teachers. It may be fairly argued, perhaps, that in districts not too 
remote women are more suitable than men for small schools of this type. Thereis, 
at all events, a sufficient number of other positions to absorb all the men in the pro- 
fession at present. 
Medical inspection of schools and school children was established 
in 1912 under the joint control of the education department and the 
department of public health. Fourmedical inspectors were appointed, 
one being stationed at each of the four chief centers of the colony. 
The system of inspection adopted at the outset has proved satisfac- 
tory, and, for the present at least, it is not thought necessary to 
examine each child more than twice, or at the most three times, 
in the course of his primary school life, except in cases of suspected 
or proved abnormality. Regular inspection is made of the children 
averaging 10 to 11 years of age. As a rule, this is done by the medical 
inspector in any school on the first day of his visit; on the second 
day he examines special cases from other classes brought under his 
notice by the head teacher or selected by himself. 
Instruction in the medical inspection of children is given to the 
students of the training colleges (normal schools), and, as opportunity 
occurs, to teachers already at work in the schools; so that in course of 
time the detection of certain physical defects in the scholars will not 
be left to the experts. 
Figures compiled from the weights and heights of some fifteen 
thousand children returned by school teachers last year seem to 
indicate that the average New Zealand child is heavier and taller 
than the average English child of the same age. 
The medical inspectors also report on the schools in respect of the 
lighting, heating, ventilation, cleanliness, etc., and there are many 
instances in which suggested improvements involving no expendi- 
ture have been effected. Emphasis is placed on the value of fresh 
air, and teachers are encouraged to teach out of doors or in open 
shelters whenever it is possible. 
The expenditure on medical inspection for the financial year ended 
March 31, 1914, was £4,183. 
The report shows a steady increase in the provision for manual 
and technical instruction in the colony. Of the elementary schools, 
70 per cent have equipment for these branches, including in the 
73226°—rp 1914—vor 1——50  
-P-A-G-E-822
  786 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1914. 
higher standards woodwork, cookery, laundry work, and dress- 
making for girls. Classes in these subjects are managed on the cen- 
tral system and by special instructors. In the larger centers, manual- 
training schools are provided, to which the classes come from the 
regular schools. In the smaller centers the training is given in 
rooms assigned for the purpose in one of the regular school buildings. 
Attention is called to the great interest manifested in instruction on 
subjects bearing upon home life. The want of properly trained 
teachers for the domestic subjects, noted in previous reports, has 
been nearly overcome as a result of the establishment of full courses 
in home science at the Otago University and the provision, by the 
Government, of special scholarship funds to students desiring to 
avail themselves of the opportunity. 
In the rural districts there is noticeable increase in the number of 
schools providing instruction relating to rural occupations. In the 
ease of 10 out of 13 education districts, this.work is supervised by 
itinerant teachers having a special knowledge of agriculture. The 
course of instruction includes both experimental and observational 
work, and in some districts elementary dairy work. This movement 
is fostered by school committees, agricultural and rural associations, 
and members of the farming communities generally. In addition to 
several prizes offered for competition, contributions in money to the 
value of about $2,500 were made to education boards during the year. 
The Government doubles every such contribution. Practical in- 
struction of the same general nature as that given in the elementary 
schools is extended to the secondary schools receiving Government 
grants. 
The Government gives liberal support to classes and schools for 
special technical instruction, apportioning its bounty to the amount 
contributed locally for the same purpose. 
In addition to the provision of centers for technical instruction, 
the colony has six completely organized technical colleges, including 
the Dunedin School of Art, which is maintained in the interests of 
industries requiring the work of artists as well as that of skilled 
artisans. 
New Zealand has been very active in promoting the education of 
the native population. For the year under review there were 107 
native schools, in which 4,000 children of both sexes were instructed, 
and the ratio of average attendance to enrollment was maintained at 
85.7 per cent. The attendance of native pupils at secondary and 
mission schools would raise to 5,182 the number of Maori children 
receiving the benefits of English education. 
The policy of fostering secondary education by subsidies to private 
schools and by scholarship funds, enabling promising pupils of 
limited means to prolong their education, is continued. In 1913 there
-P-A-G-E-823

were 30 secondary schools, with 4,592 nonpaying students in a total 
enrollment of 5,803. The following tables indicate the present scope 
of the system under Government supervision and its extension during 
the half decade, 1908-1913:

According to information received from Dr. Mark Cohen, editor of 
the Dunedin Evening Star, one of the most notable events of the 
present year in New Zealand was the retirement on pension of Mr. 
George Hogben, who for many years filled the important post of 
inspector general of schools. In recognition of his invaluable services 
the Order of the Companionship of St. Michael and St. George was 
conferred upon him at the beginning of the year by the King of 
England. Among the reforms accomplished through the influence

and efforts of Mr. Hogben are noted the adoption of the liberal school 
of salaries for teachers, the establishment of the teachers’ superannua- 
tion fund, more flexible grading and freedom of classification, increased 
provision for the training of teachers, extension of technical educa- 
tion, the adoption of free secondary education, provision for physical 
training and medical inspection of school children, and the intro- 
duction of a special rural course of instruction in the district high 
schools.

CHAPTER XXXIX. 
EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 
ConTrn?s.—Educational itineraries through States of South America—The Fourth International Con- 
ference on the Blind—Notable events at Oxford and Edinburgh—The Napier celebration. 
ITINERARY FOR CULTURAL PURPOSES. 
During the year an itinerary was arranged by the Pan American 
Division of the Association for International Conciliation, intended to 
promote closer intellectual relations between the United States and 
the States visited. The party, which was in charge of Dr. Harry 
Erwin Bard, director of the division, consisted of 11 men, all of whom 
had paid special attention to history and economics, and were famil- 
iar with the Spanish language. With three exceptions, they had, also, 
acquired appreciation of Spanish conditions by previous residence 
either in South America, Spain, or among Spanish-speaking people 
in the United States, and thus were insured a cordial reception in the 
different States visited. It was everywhere recognized by the hosts 
in South America that the purpose in view could best be promoted 
by the study of educational and social institutions. Consequently, 
the visitors were shown all classes of schools from the most elemen- 
tary to the highest, as well as asylums, hospitals, business houses, 
theaters, art museums, etc., in order that they might observe all 
characteristic agencies for the promotion either of knowledge or social 
welfare. 
The itinerary occupied the time from May 30 to August 11, or 74 
days, 44 of which werespentat sea. It extended from Rio de Janeiro, 
on the eastern coast of South America, to Santiago de Chile, on the 
west, and included every city of note on both coasts. On account of 
the many centers of interest visited, it has been impossible for mem- 
bers of the party to do more than record their general impressions. 
Everywhere they were struck with the fine buildings provided for 
schools and other public institutions, the equipments of the higher 
scientific schools, and the extensive plants for technical and agri- 
cultural instruction. In several cities their attention was called to 
provision for welfare activities which engage the efforts of local 
authorities as well as those of private philanthropy. Special mention 
is made in their reports of the Maternity Hospital de Climerio de 
Oliveira, at Bahia, Brazil, which is managed in clcse relation with the 
789
-P-A-G-E-826
790 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
  medical school of that city; the Hotel for Immigrants, at Buenos 
Aires, which is under Government supervision, and the Hospital of 
San Salvador and the Providencia Home for Orphans, both at 
Santiago de Chile. 
Although the main object of this carefully planned visit was kept 
in view, its economic. bearings were not entirely overlooked. One 
member of the party had been specially charged to observe the 
conditions affecting trade relations with the United States, and their 
bearing upon courses of instruction in the high schools of this country. 
Tn a brief report on this subject he says: 
The most important conclusion of our visit is the great value and importance of the 
study of Spanish in our high schools, and, as soon as possible, in our elementary schools. 
The 100,000,000 people of the United States will have more and more to do with the 
80,000,000 people in Spanish America in business, science, arts, literature, and poli- 
tics. The opening of the Panama Canal and the great European war have tended to 
bring the two great peoples much closer together. They are looking to us for credits 
in the financial world, manufactured articles, raw products, machinery, books, just as 
they have looked in the past for political examples. 
They have been reaching out toward us much more than we toward them. They 
offer their high-school pupils English for three or more years in Brazil, Argentina, and 
Chile. They send an increasingly larger percentage of their best students to continue 
their education in the United States. They everywhere teach more of the history and 
geography of the United States than we teach of Spanish America, so that the average 
Latin American is not so ignorant of the United States as we are of hiscountry. What 
has been said of Spanish applies also to the study of Portuguese—the mother tongue 
of 20,000,000 Brazilians. * * * Along with this knowledge of Spanish there must 
be training in geography, history, manners, customs, literature, and art of our Latin 
American brethren. 
When a person knows these he will be in an appreciative and sympathetic attitude. 
He will then be muy simpatico.' 
STUDENT ITINERARY IN SOUTH AMERICA. 
Among the events of international importance which the outbreak 
of war in Europe caused to be indefinitely postponed was the fourth 
international congress of American students, called at Santiago, Chile, 
for the first week in September. For many reasons it seemed desirable 
that the delegation of young men from the United States to this 
congress should be selected with great care. The Commissioner of 
Education was accordingly asked to interest himself in the matter, 
and a fund for traveling expenses was subscribed by the Carnegie - 
Endowment for International Peace and placed in his hands. 
Of six selected candidates ? five accepted the appointment and had 
started on their journey when news of the postponement of the con- 
1 Report made to the board of education of New York City by William T. Morrey, president of the high- 
school teachers’ association. 
2 The six delegates selected were as follows: Mr. Arthur C. Burch, of Northwestern University; 
Mr. Nemours H. Clement, of Tulane University of Louisiana; Mr. Joseph F. Gunster, of the Catholic 
University of America; Mr. John Heath, of Leland Stanford Junior University; Mr. Wendell E. Phillips, 
of Cornell University; Mr. Adelbert F. Smithers, of Columbia University.

ITINERARY FOR CULTURAL PURPOSES. 791 
gress was received at Washington. Tour of the delegates were beyond 
immediate communication at the time, and it was decided to forward 
them instructions to proceed on a tour of observation with the general 
purpose of promoting fraternal relations with student bodies in the 
centers visited. 
The three delegates who received their new instructions at Monte- 
video subsequently forwarded to the Commissioner of Education a 
report, from which the following particulars are derived: 
Owing to difficulties occasioned by the European war, the fourth international 
congress of American students which was to have been held in Santiago, Chile, during 
September, has been postponed, probably until April of next year. We were unable 
even to reach Chile, because of the complete demoralization of transportation facilities 
during the time in question. The news of the postponement did not reach us until 
our arrival at Montevideo, where we were received by the director of the Oficina Inter- 
nacional Universitaria Americana and invited to remain as their guests. We gladly 
accepted, and throughout our stay in the progressive Uruguayan capital we were 
accorded the most distinguished hospitality and courtesy, even the President of the 
Republic and the minister of foreign affairs being so kind as to receive us. In Buenos 
Aires and La Plata our reception was also of the utmost cordiality, on the part of the 
university students personally and through their organizations; on the part of the 
educational authorities; and on the part of the American residents. The unflagging 
attentions of the students especially made it possible for us to become well acquainted. 
with the university life, organizations, and current questions of interest. * * * 
In Rio de Janeiro, our last stopping place, the shortness of our stay prevented us 
from accomplishing all that we wished, but as far as we could go we encountered the 
same hospitality and courtesy and the same desire to cooperate that was evident 
everywhere else. 
The cordial attentions everywhere extended to the delegates were 
interpreted by them as indicating a general belief that the present is 
a time of great importance for future relations with the United States. 
On this point the report says: 
In the three countries that we visited there is a general realization of the fact that 
the present is the opportunity of the United States in South America. Furthermore, 
there is a feeling of expectation that the United States will take advantage of that 
opportunity. Some action, more or less vague, but of prime importance, on the part 
of our country is awaited, and even those who fear it rather than hope for it, consider 
it inevitable. The people are prepared materially and psychologically for a great 
development of the intellectual, social, and commercial relations between the two 
Americas, and a great number are even anxious to lend it their aid. 
With regard to unfriendly feeling toward the United States the 
delegates say: 
The exact extent of that feeling can not be measured in a short stay, least of all by 
those in contact with the whole-hearted cordiality and good fellowship that surrounded 
us, but nevertheless its existence is undisputed. Quite obviously, this unfriendliness 
to the United States is not evenly distributed and is far from universal, especially 
among the thinking classes; but those few who are unfriendly have deep-rooted 
antipathies and they play skillfully upon student patriotism and popular prejudice. 
* * * All depend for the success of their pleas on the suspicious fear of the possible 
imperialism of a stronger neighbor and on the dislike attendant upon that fear. 
   
-P-A-G-E-828
792 EDUCATION REPORT, 1914. 
  Among the causes of these suspicions and apprehensions are noted 
the prevailing ignorance in the United States as to South American 
conditions, indifference to their social amenities and national achieve- 
ments; and the widely distributed misinterpretations of the Pan 
American policy of the Government of the United States. 
The report dwells at length on the means of correcting the false 
notions on the part of the different peoples interested, which in 
South America should aim “‘to destroy a misconception,” and in the 
United States ‘‘to create a positive impression.” 
Among the means suggested for accomplishing this purpose the 
report emphasizes the following: 
1. The establishment of a publicity bureau whose task shall be the popular dis- 
semination of information through the newspapers and the general monthly peri- 
odicals, * * * It could carry on the same propaganda of education, with an even 
wider audience, by means of well-prepared, well-chosen motion-picture films. 
2. The exchange of professors and students. Since these students should not 
only learn from the country to which they go, but also teach it concerning the country 
from which they proceed, they should preferably be what we term ‘‘graduate 
students.” 
3. General courses on Latin America in schools and universities and especially 
the teaching of Spanish and Portuguese as two of the great modern languages of cul- 
ture and not merely as commercial subjects to be studied in conjunction with book- 
keeping and stenography, as is often done. Least of all should they be placed among 
the ‘‘extra” languages for which no credit is given. 
4, The exchange of student periodicals. While our undergraduate newspapers 
and magazines could not receive anything similar in return, they would serve to 
illustrate phases of our college life which have practically no counterpart in 
Latin America, The professional school reviews, on the other hand, would have 
many excellent magazines with which to exchange. * * * In South America the 
Oficina Internacional Universitaria Americana would be the ideal center for such 
work, and its directors have expressed to us their hearty desire to cooperate in any 
movement for its accomplishment. * * * 
5. The translation of university catalogues and prospectuses in terms intelligible 
to the country in which they are to be distributed. 
6. Cooperation with the Oficina Internacional Universitaria Americana, This 
headquarters of the international American student federation was established at 
Montevideo and was placed under the management of the Uruguayan University 
men by vote of the Second Pan American Congress of Students, held in Buenos Aires 
in 1910. Its scope was broadened hy the third congress, which took place in Lima 
in 1912, and a fixed sum to be paid annually for its maintenance by all the Govern- 
ments represented was decided upon. * * * Because of the high character and 
standing of those who have been and are connected with its management, the Oficina 
enjoys considerable prestige and, among other privileges, has been granted the postal 
and telegraph frank by several countries. Under its present able directors especially, 
it affords boundless opportunities for developing friendly intercourse among the 
students of the United States and the students of Latin America. 
The report closes with special mention of officials and educators 
whose kindness and hospitality made the trip both agreeable and 
instructive. The list, which is extensive, includes the diplomatic 
and consular representatives of the United States in the different
-P-A-G-E-829

countries visited, the student federation at Rio de Janeiro and 
La Plata, representatives of the Young Men’s Christian Associations 
at all the cities visited, and the officers of the Oficina Internacional 
Universitaria Americana at Montevideo. 
The report is signed by Mr. Adelbert F. Smithers, delegate repre- 
senting Columbia University, New York, and Mr. Wendell E. Phil- 
lips, representing Cornell University. 
CONFERENCE ON THE BLIND. 
The Fourth International Conference on the Blind was held in 
London June 18 to 24. High officials of the state and church were 
included among its officers, and the arrangements for delegates were 
in charge of a very efficient executive committee. 
The subject of the conference was illustrated by an exposition, 
including articles made by the blind, books, apparatus, etc., for their 
use, objects of historical interest, and representations of various 
handicrafts in which the blind are employed. Many entertainments 
were given in the interest of visitors, including a garden party at the 
Royal Normal College for the Blind, Upper Norwood; a play by a 
blind author performed by blind actors; organ recitals and concerts 
by blind musicians. 
A full report of the conference, with the exhibition catalogue, was 
published for gratuitous distribution to subscribers.' 
NOTABLE EVENTS AT OXFORD AND EDINBURGH. 
At the septenary celebration of the birth of Roger Bacon and the 
tercentenary celebration of the invention of logarithms, the Bureau 
of Education was represented by Prof. David Eugene Smith, of 
Teachers College, Columbia University, who has submitted the follow- 
ing reports of those notable events: 
THE BACON SEPTENARY CELEBRATION. 
The Bacon celebration was held at Oxford on June 10, 1914, and was attended by a 
number of distinguished scholars from various leading countries. A statue of Bacon, 
the work of the English sculptor, Mr. Hope-Pinker, was presented to the university 
on behalf of the delegates and visitors by Sir Archibald Geikie, F. R. S., and was 
accepted by Lord Curzon, chancellor of the university. An oration was then delivered 
in Latin by Prof. A. D. Godley. Following these exercises a luncheon was given to 
the delegates at Merton College and in the afternoon a garden party was given in the 
grounds of Wadham College. 
One of the most interesting features of the celebration was the noteworthy exhibit 
cf Bacon manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, This was prepared under the super- 
vision of Mr. Madan, Bodley’s librarian, who was very attentive to the interests of 
the visiting delegates. 
  
1 Additional congresses which had been announced for the summer and fall were given up on account 
of the war. Among the number was the Fourth International Congress on Home Education, which was 
to have been held at Philadelphia, Sept. 22-29.

THE NAPIER CELEBRATION. 
The Napier celebration of the three hundredth anniversary of the invention of 
logarithms was held at Edinburgh on July 24-28, 1914. Over 300 visitors attended 
the meetings, including delegates from all parts of the world. The ceremonies opened 
under the presidency of the lord provost of Edinburgh, and an address was delivered 
by Lord Moulton, one of England’s best-known jurists. Lord Moulton applied his 
great legal talent in tracing out, from Napier’s works, the probable reason for preparing 
only a logarithmic table of sines, and his probable methods of computing. Brief 
addresses of an impromptu character were delivered by four of the delegates, Profs. 
Andoyer and D’Ocagne of Paris, Smith of New York, and Bauschinger of Strassburg. 
On Saturday morning, July 25, the first session was held under the presidency of 
Prof. Hobson, of Cambridge. The presidents of the subsequent sessions were Prof. 
Smith of New York, Dr. J. W. L. Glaisher of Cambridge, and Maj. P. A. MacMahon of 
London. A list of the papers read at the various sessions and the names of their 
authors is appended. 
On Friday evening a reception was given by the lord provost and council of Edin- 
burgh, followed by a concert. On Saturday afternoon a garden party was held at the 
ancient seat of the Napier family, Merchiston Castle, the visitors being permitted to 
see the room in which Napier ‘worked out the first logarithms. An informal reception 
was given on Saturday evening by the committee in charge of the celebration, and a 
farewell reception was given on Monday afternoon by the Royal Society of Edin- 
burgh. A special memorial service was held at St. Giles’s Cathedral on Sunday. 
Among the interesting features of the celebration was an exhibit of Napieriana and 
of calculating machines and devices of various kinds, an elaborate catalogue of which 
was prepared by Mr. E. M. Horsburgh. 
LIST OF PAPERS READ AT THE SESSIONS OF THE NAPIER CELEBRATION.

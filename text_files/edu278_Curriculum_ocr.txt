PREFACE 
Srvce the opening of the twentieth century, the evolu- 
tion of our social order has been proceeding with great and 
ever-accelerating rapidity. Simple conditions have been 
growing complex. Small institutions have been growing 
large. Increased specialization has been multiplying human 
interdependencies and the consequent need of coérdinating 
effort. Democracy is increasing within the Nation; and 
growing throughout the world. All classes are aspiring to a 
full human opportunity. Never before have civilization and 
humanization advanced so swiftly. 
As the world presses eagerly fotwhird toward the accom- 
plishment of new things, education also must advance no less 
swiftly. It must provide the intelligence and the aspirations 
necessary for the advance; and for stability and consistency 
in holding the gains. Education must take a pace set, not by 
itself, but by social progress. 
/The present program of public education was mainly for-\ 
mulated during the simpler conditions of the nineteenth cen- | 
? tury. In details it has been improved. In fundamentals it is - 
not greatly different. A program never designed for the 
present day has been inherited. 
Any inherited system, good for its time, when held to 
after its day, hampers social progress. It is not enough that 
the system, fundamentally unchanged in plan and purpose, 
be improved in details. In education this has been done in 
conspicuous degree. Our schools to-day are better than ever 
before. Teachers are better trained. Supervision is more ade- 
quate. Buildings and equipment are enormously improved. 
Effective methods are being introduced, and time is being

economized. Improvements are visible on every hand. And 
yet to do the nineteenth-century task better than it was then 
done is not necessarily to do the twentieth-century task. 
New duties lie before us. And these require new methods, 
new materials, new vision. The old education, except as it 
conferred the tools of knowledge, was mainly devoted to 
filling the memory with facts. The new age is more in need 
of facts than the old}‘and”6f more facts; and it must find 
more effective methods of teaching them. But there are 
now other functions. (Education is now to develop.a type 
of wisdom that can grow only out of~participation-in. the 
living experiences of men, and never out of mere memoriza- 
tion of verbal statements of facts!) It must, therefore, train 
thought and judgment in Gomnection with actual life- 
situations, a task distinctly different from the cloistral ac- 
tivities of the past. It is also to develop the good-will, the 
spirit of service, the social valuations, sympathies, and atti- 
tudes of mind necessary for effective group-action where 
specialization has created endless interdependency. It has 
the function of training every citizen, man or woman, not 
for knowledge about citizenship, but for proficiency in 
citizenship; not for knowledge about hygiene, but for pro- 
ficiency in maintaining robust health; not for a mere knowl- 
edge of abstract science, but for proficiency in the use of 
ideas in the control of practical situations. Most of these 
are new tasks. In connection with each, much is now be- 
ing done in all progressive school systems; but most of 
them yet are but partially developed. We have been de- 
veloping knowledge, not function; the power to reproduce 
facts, rather than the powers to think and feel and will and 
act in vital relation to the world’s life. Now we must look to 
these latter things as well. 
Our task in this volume is to point out some of the new 
duties. We are to show why education must now under- 4
-P-A-G-E-5
  PREFACE Vv 
take tasks that until recently were not considered needful; 
why new methods, new materials, and new types of experi- 
ence must be employed. We here try to develop a point of 
view that seems to be needed by practical school men and 
women as they make the educational adjustments now de- 
manded by social conditions; and needed also by scientific 
workers who are seeking to define with accuracy the ob- 
jectives of education. It is the feeling of the writer that in 
the social reconstructions of the post-war years that lie 
just ahead of us, education is to be called upon to bear a 
hitherto undreamed-of burden of responsibility; and to 
undertake unaccustomed labors. To present some of the 
theory needed for the curriculum labors of this new age 
has been ‘the task herein attempted. 
This is a first book in a field that until recently has been 
too little cultivated. For a long time, we have been develop- 
ing the theory of educational method, both general and 
special; and we have required teachers and supervisors to 
be thoroughly cognizant of it. Recently, however, we have 
discerned that there is a theory of curriculum-formulation 
that is no less extensive and involved than that of method; 
and that it is just as much needed by teachers and super- 
visors. To know what to do is as important as to know how 
to do it. This volume, therefore, is designed for teacher- 
training institutions as an introductory textbook in the 
theory of the curriculum; and for reading circles in the train- 
ing of teachers in service. It is hoped also that it may 
assist the general reader who is interested in noting recent 
educational tendencies,

THE CURRICULUM 
CHAPTER I 
TWO LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE 
Current discussion of education reveals the presence in 
the field of two antagonistic schools of educational thought. 
On the one hand are those who look primarily to the sub- 
' jective results: the enriched mind, quickened appreciations, 
refined sensibilities, discipline, culture. To them the end 
\ of education is the ability to live rather than the practical 
“ability to_produce/ For them most of education is to be mo- 
tivated by interest in the educational experiences themselves, 
without particular solicitude at the moment as to the prac- 
tical use or uselessness of those experiences. If they expand 
and unfold the potential nature of the individual, therein 
lies their justification. The full unfoldment of one’s powers 
is the primordial preparation for practical life. 
On the other hand there are those who hold that educa- 
fi m. is to look primarily and consciously to efficient prac- 
{ ti ction in a practical world. The individual is edu- 
| cal gee perform efficiently the labors of his calling; 
| who can effectively cotperate with his fellows in social and 
| civic affairs; who can keep his bodily powers at a high level 
| of efficiency; who is prepared to participate in proper range 
\ of desirable leisure occupations; who can effectively bring 
\his children to full-orbed manhood and womanhood; and 
\who can carry on all his social relations with his fellows in 
an agreeable and effective manner. Education is consciously 
to prepare for these things.
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 THE CURRICULUM 
The controversy involves practically every field of train- 
ing. For example, the advocates of _cu culture would have 
science studied because it is a rich and vil Vitalizing field of hu- 
man thought. They would have the student live abundantly 
within the wide fields of his chemistry or biology or physics 
without at the time any great regard for the practical use or 
uselessness of the particular facts met with. If the experience 
is vivifying, if it satisfies intellectual cravings, therein is to 
be found its sufficient excuse. They assume that enough of 
the scientific facts, principles, and habits of mind acquired 
will be of use afterwards to justify the teaching from a purely 
utilitarian point of view. In fact, they assert that these things 
can be better mastered when studied as “science for science’ 
sake” than when narrowed down to practical science for the 
work’s sake. 
The utilitarians, on the other hand, would have science 
studied in order that the facts may be put to work by farm- 
ers in their farming, by mechanics in their shops, and va- 
riously in the fields of manufacturing, mining, cooking, san- 
itation, etc. They would have an accurate survey made of 
the science-needs of each social class; and to each they would 
teach only the facts needed; only those that are to be put 
to work. In an age of efficiency and economy they would 
seek definitely to eliminate the useless and the wasteful. 
To cover the broad fields of the sciences without regard to 
the functioning value of the particular facts is a blunder- 
buss method in an age that demands the accuracy of the 
rifle. It is to waste time and energy and money that are 
needed elsewhere. It is to force upon unwilling students 
things that can be justified upon no practical grounds. 
A social study like history or literature the culture-advo- 
cates conceive to be chiefly a means of lifting the curtain 
upon human experience in all lands and ages. It gives the 
pupil an opportunity to view and to mingle vicariously in
-P-A-G-E-13
  TWO LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE 6 
the age-long varied pageant of world-wide human life. The 
pupil’s business is simply to look upon this pageant as he 
would view a play at the theater. The experience is in itself 
a satisfying mode of living, enriching his consciousness, ex- 
panding the fields of his imagination, refining his apprecia- 
tions. When in his reading he beholds the “glory that was 
Greece and the splendour that was Rome,” the epics of 
Homer or the dramas of Shakespeare, he need not concern 
himself with the application of that experience in the per- 
formance of his practical duties. On the other hand, the 
utilitarians tell us that we would better eliminate ancient 
history and the older literatures. These deal with a world 
that is dead, a civilization that is mouldered, with govern- 
ments that are now obsolete, with manners and customs and 
languages that are altogether impracticable in this modern 
age. In their judgment, in so far as we need history at all, it 
should be modern history drawn for the purpose of throwing 
light upon current practical problems of industry, commerce, 
and citizenship. The facts should be gathered in definite re- 
lation to the problems and not be mere blunderbuss history 
that aims at nothing in particular. And as for literature, they 
say, it would best be that which reveals the world of to-day: 
the present natures of men and women; present-day social 
problems and human reactions; current modes of thought; 
existing conditions in the fields of commerce, industry, 
sanitation, civic relationships, and recreational life; not 
classics, but current literature. 
The controversy is particularly marked in the matter of 
foreign languages. Ancient languages do not function in 
the lives of men, say the utilitarians: therefore they should 
be cast out. For the vast majority, even the modern lan- 
guages do not function. What does not appear in the lives 
of the people has no reason to appear in the education of the 
people. The argument is plausible, convincing; and yet the
-P-A-G-E-14
6 THE CURRICULUM 
foreign-language advocate is not convinced. He asserts 
that important matters are lost sight of; that there are more 
things in human life than practical action, however efficient; 
that living itself is worth while; that it is the end of education; 
and that the various utilities are but to provide the means. 
He looks to a self-realization, to a humanism, to a world of 
satisfactions that lie above and beyond the mere means to 
be used in attaining those high ends. He accuses our prac- 
tical age of aiming at a life for man that is too narrow, 
barren, mechanical, materialistic. 
Now, which side is right? Doubtless both are right. It is 
like asking the question, “Which shall the tree produce, the 
flower or the fruit?” It must produce both or it will not 
perform its full function. We have here simply to do with 
two levels of functioning, two levels of educational expe- 
riences, both of which are essential to fullness of growth, 
efficiency of action, and completeness of character. Both are 
good, both are necessary; one precedes the other. One is ex- 
perience upon the play-level: the other experience upon the 
work-level. One is action driven by spontaneous interest: 
the other, by derived interest. One is the luxuriation of the 
subjective life which has a value for objective experience 
even though one be not conscious of the values at the time. 
The other looks to the conscious shaping and control of the 
objective world; but requires for maximum effectiveness the 
background of subjective life provided by the other. 
The culture-people are not wrong in demanding an edu- 
cation that looks to the widening of vision, the deepening 
of the general understanding, the actualizing of one’s poten- 
tial powers, the full-orbed expansion and maintenance of 
the personality, the harnessing-up of native interests, the 
development of enthusiasms and ideals; or briefly, the full 
humanization of the individual. They cannot too much 
insist.  
-P-A-G-E-15
  , TWO LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE 7 
The practical-minded people are not wrong in affirming 
that man’s life consists, and must consist, largely in the 
performance of responsible duties; that these are to be ca- 
pably performed; that responsibilities are to be efficiently 
absolved; that there is need of technical accuracy, depend- 
ableness, industry, persistence, right habits, skill, practical 
knowledge, physical and moral fiber, and adherence to duty 
whether it be pleasant or painful; and that these results are 
not to be sufficiently achieved without education of the 
practical work-type. Upon these things they cannot too 
much insist. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
CHAPTER II 
EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE UPON THE PLAY-LEVEL 
Recent psychology tells us that man has a long period of 
childhood and youth in order that he may play. He plays, 
not because he is young, but he is long young in order that 
he may play; and thus through active experience secure his 
education. Play i is Nature’s active mode of education. 
Shall a boy unfold his physical powers so that he can 
run with speed and endurance, or throw accurately or fight 
with strength and skill, or exert himself long hours without 
undue fatigue? Nature provides that in his play he shall run 
and throw and fight and otherwise exert himself; and thus 
make actual his potential powers. Physical play is Nature’s 
physical education. Shall the boy develop the social abilities 
necessary for full codperation with the members of his social 
group? Nature provides instinctive tendency to participate 
in group-plays, social games, conversation, etc., which de- 
velop his social nature, fix his social habits, and cement so- 
cial solidarity.” Social play is Nature’s active method of 
social education. Shall the boy possess an unspecialized 
mechanical ability of a type that is even more needful to- 
day than in the age when man’s nature was shaped? Fortu- 
nately, here again we find the strong constructive and oper- 
ative play-instincts which drive boys to make and operate 
things. Give a normal-minded boy a rich opportunity to’ 
make things and to “‘make them go,” — and one has then 
only to leave him alone with his opportunity. Nature’s 
method of education will do the rest. Shall he be observant 
of men and affairs about him? Shall he fill his mind concern- 
ing the things with which he is to be concerned throughout
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE PLAY-LEVEL 9 
life? Shall he acquire and maintain masses of knowledge 
through the possession of an inquiring disposition? Again 
Nature has provided the deep-lying and powerful mental- 
play instinct of curiosity, the intellectual appetite, the desire 
to know. The boy is made watchful of everything that 
goes on about him, especially the actions of men. Thus he 
learns and thus he continues to learn throughout life. 
Mental play is Nature’s active method of filling the mind 
with information. 
(Since education is so largely a matter of learning things, 
let us first take up this topic of mental play as the basis of 
intellectual education. )One observes men and their affairs, 
the things of one’s environment, and the natural phenomena 
by which one is surrounded, simply as a mode of living. 
Through such observation he is continuously gathering facts 
through all of his waking hours; and without question as to 
the use or uselessness of the information. He makes no 
attempt to observe merely the things that can be of practical 
service in his personal affairs. He lives most fully who keeps 
himself awake to everything before him and who sees all 
in due relation and proportion even though most of it has 
no visible relation to his practical affairs. 
Not only does he observe directly, but he listens with 
msuming interest to the stories of things which he has 
not seen. Most of the gossip of the daily papers relates to 
things with which he has no immediate concern. And yet 
he reads and learns, and feels that if he does not do so he 
does not fully live. The avidity with which he absorbs the 
news or the eager curiosity with which gossips delve into 
the affairs of the neighborhood show the universality and 
the intensity of this hunger after knowledge, even of useless 
type. One drinks endlessly at this fountain without ever 
so much as raising the question whether the knowledge so 
obtained is or can ever be of any use. Like breathing, one
-P-A-G-E-18
10 THE CURRICULUM 
feels it to be a natural portion of living which requires no 
justification. 
Learning things because of curiosity without reference to 
the use of that knowledge is really one of the largest normal 
activities of man. Knowledge-getting because of curiosity 
is analogous to food-getting because of hunger. One wants 
the food when hungry whether he knows anything about 
its functional value or not. The hunger is Nature’s way of 
ascribing value to things that the man needs. Equally, the 
healthy mind wants to know the things that appeal to the 
mental appetite without care at the time as to their prac- 
tical application. This knowledge-hunger is Nature’s 
method of ascribing value to the things that the man needs 
— when he is too immature or too stupid to know what he 
needs. Such strong and continuing instincts impel only to 
things that are on the whole useful and necessary. 
It is play; but it has its values. Although most things 
observed have no visible relation to his immediate affairs, 
yet everything in the community is related to everything 
else in subtle, intangible, and usually unknown ways. Each 
individual is the center of a vortex of influences. He needs 
an understanding of the total life of the community in order 
that he may adjust his actions to the factors of the situation 
as a whole. His current information concerning appar- 
ently useless things really gives him fullness of vision of the 
total pageant of community life of which he forms a part. 
This fullness of vision is necessary for understanding; for 
valuations; and right social attitudes. 
While traveling to my work in the Orient, some years ago, 
I had occasion to observe a portion of the educational ex- 
periences of two boys about twelve years of age. The ship 
on which we were traveling stopped for a day or two at each 
of a number of ports: Hongkong, Shanghai, Nagasaki, Kobe, 
Yokohama, etc. Scarcely had the ship come to anchor when  
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE PLAY-LEVEL i 
the boys were off and away on an exploring expedition. For 
them it was a region strange and new. There was no assign- 
ment of anything for them to learn; they were not sent; 
they were not going ashore to get information so that they 
might recite upon it at night; it was not a thing upon which 
they were later to be examined. Simply a rich field of experi- 
ence opened before them and they eagerly embraced their 
opportunities and went forth to partake to the full. It was 
simply play-experience resulting from their intellectual 
hungers. During the day they visited as many different 
portions of the city as their time and their means of loco- 
motion would permit. They looked into the residences of 
rich and poor, into the shops, amusement places, religious 
temples, soldiers’ barracks, streets and alleys, the condi- 
tions of life among the well-to-do and among the poor, etc. 
They came back to the ship at night with rich stores of 
experience and full to overflowing with information. It 
required no effort on the part of the adult members of their 
party to secure extended and enthusiastic verbal reports. 
The boys were living. They were not simply memorizing 
facts. It was all upon the play-level; and yet they were se- 
curing the best possible type of education. Had it been made 
a work-task for them with definite program and time allot- 
ments, with reports that had to be put up in specified form 
and with examinations to see that nothing had been over- 
looked, —would they have left the ship? And in what mood? 
This experience of the two boys seems to indicate the kind 
of intellectual play-experience needed throughout the fields 
of education. In the same way, impelled only by curiosity 
and the play-motive, following the leadings of interest, 
children and youth should, it appears, wander through 
every important field of human knowledge and human 
experience. Without any particular consciousness of the se- 
rious values or purposes of the learning, they should thus
-P-A-G-E-20
12 THE CURRICULUM 
lay a wide and secure foundation of understanding of all 
important aspects of reality. So far as possible, this should 
be by observation. But one’s horizon is narrow, and most 
of this world lies beyond, and stretches backward through 
history. Most is to be explored vicariously in imagination 
on the basis of the reports of others. For this, pupils need 
books that vividly reconstruct the experiences of others. 
There is a great wealth of geographical readings, espe- 
cially travels, which present a vivid reconstruction of life in 
other lands. As children travel, for example, in their read- 
ings with Peary to the North Pole, or with Amundsen and 
Scott to the South Pole, their experiences will bring them 
to appreciate the nature of the polar regions almost as clearly 
as if they had been there in the flesh. Let them travel in 
spirit with Livingstone and Stanley and Roosevelt into the 
heart of Africa and they will have an appreciation of the 
nature of Central Africa that they can obtain in no other 
way. Let them travel with Captain Cook and Darwin and 
Stevenson through the South Seas, with Dana in his voyage 
around the “Horn,” with Tyndall and Jordan in the Alps, 
with John Muir and Enos Mills in the Rockies, with George 
Kennan in Siberia, etc., — let them thus travel vicariously 
through the various lands and regions of the earth, and they 
will come to have a full appreciation of the nature of the 
world. In the reading of literature with geographical back- 
ground like Captains Courageous, Heidi, Kim, The Iron 
Trail, The Lumberman, etc., children are permitted further 
to relive the lives of peoples in various lands and under 
various conditions; and thus through living acquire under- 
standing. These geographical readings should aim, not at 
information, but at experience. Like the two boys roaming 
through the cities merely as a mode of living, the children 
in our schools should roam through the wide earth in the 
pages of their reading merely as a satisfying mode of living.
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE PLAY-LEVEL 13 
The more unsophisticated, the less they are conscious of 
the serious values, the more they simply follow interest, 
probably the better will be the experience for education. 
History presents another rich and endless field for explo- 
| ration upon the play-level. This children should read for 
the sake of their interest in the human story, in the anec- 
dotes, the biographies, the struggles, the adventures, and 
all.of the other things that appeal to childhood and youth. 
Thus they should become acquainted with all the family 
of nations. They should participate in the historical experi- 
ences of all important countries for the same type of delight 
that actuated the boys in exploring the foreign cities. They 
need not know at the time the values of this experience in 
developing large-group consciousness, national and plane- 
tary sympathies and understandings, the bases of civic 
judgment, or the solid foundations of any “Federation of 
the World” which we may ever produce. 
The teacher must see the serious ends in order to adjust 
conditions, to control motives, and to guide. But children 
should not be greatly conscious of the growth-ends of play- 
experience. The play-spirit is a skittish thing that tends to 
take flight when it sees itself harnessed up and set to pro- 
saic productive labors. On this level it is enough for the 
children that the historical reconstructions be true, vivid, 
interesting, voluminous, and: rapidly read; that the experi- 
ence be a satisfying mode of living, like going to a play, or 
reading an exciting story. On this level it should not be con- 
scious learning of facts, —for the reason that we want more 
learning than can be accomplished that way; and other things 
equally valuable that cannot be accomplished that way at all. 
One has a natural interest, not only in the affairs of men, 
but also in the things and forces with which men are sur- 
rounded and with which they must deal: the phenomena of 
nature, the fields of science. Give healthy-minded children
-P-A-G-E-22
  4 THE CURRICULUM 
a full opportunity to indulge in the playful manipulation of 
toys, tools, machines, appliances, and materials that involve 
mechanical principles; the making and operation of electrical 
devices; the manipulation of sound-producing apparatus and 
instruments; of lenses; projection apparatus; photographic 
apparatus; experimentation with the chemical elements; 
exploring geological formations; keeping pets; visiting the 
Zoo, the Aviary, the Aquarium, or the plant conserva- 
tory; observing plants and animals in their native haunts 
and habitats;— give the unspoiled child proper oppor- 
tunities at these things and he asks no better fun. He 
brings to them the same eager intellectual desires to know 
that inspire the trained scientist who delights in scientific 
“Imowledge for its own sake.” Let the child, therefore, 
explore the world of reality as widely and deeply as he can 
be enabled to get at it; and when he has reached the limita- 
tions imposed by conditions, let him read the stories of 
insect life, of flowers, birds, bees, rocks, stars, animals wild 
and tame, electricity and its applications, chemistry and its 
wonders, mechanics and inventions, light and sound and 
heat, and all the rest. Naturally he will explore according 
to his maturity. Much of this can be accomplished in the 
elementary schools — more than school people have usually 
thought possible. Still more of it should come in the high 
school. Probably the scientific interest is no stronger in the 
high school than in the elementary; simply pupils are capable 
of seeing wider and deeper relations. It is probable that the 
science experience of the elementary level should cover a 
wide range. Then upon the high-school level they will 
simply go into greater detail and attain the higher levels of 
generality. After one is familiar with the concrete details, 
the tracing-out of general relationships and discovering the 
natural organization of the field are among the normal 
intellectual delights, 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE PLAY-LEVEL 15 
Neither the laboratory nor reading experiences upon this 
level need be functional in the consciousness of the children 
any more than the daily newspaper or one’s observations 
out of a car window. The experience is not to be so sys- 
tematized that the spontaneous play-spirit is destroyed. 
here is not to be too much teaching. What the children 
crave and need is experience. 'The school’s main task is to 
supply opportunities that are so varied and attractive that, 
like the two boys when they arrived at a port, pupils will 
want to plunge in and to enjoy the opportunities that are 
laced before them. 
All of these preliminary studies or experiences, whether 
geographical, historical, literary, or scientific, like children’s 
play in general need to be rich in details, full of human 
color, infinitely varied, touched lightly and then left behind, 
taken up as prompted by interest not by logic, superficial, 
repetitious, and loosely organized. There is need of move- 
ment, irregularity, caprice, variety, and incessant interplay 
of all the factors that compose the human spirit. For such 
are the ways of childhood; and even of youth and adulthood 
in the hours of their freedom. 
Enough has been said to illustrate the nature of educa- 
tional experience upon the play-level in fields that involve 
a large intellectual element: but there are other kinds of 
play. The usual manual training shop is a play-shop, and 
the kitchen a play-kitchen. The experiences in the main are 
but a liberation of the constructive and operative play- 
instincts. And upon the early or preliminary levels of one’s 
education this is as it should be. For where the equipment 
is such as to permit diversity of experience with tools, 
machines, materials, and processes, there is nothing so 
good as play-experience for laying the solid foundations for 
the later industrial studies. 
‘ {it is generally conceded nowadays that the best type of
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 THE CURRICULUM 
physical training is the liberation of the physical play- 
impulses of children.) Systematic gymnastics and calisthen- 
ics are being discarded and in their stead we are introducing 
a great variety of indoor and outdoor games, sports, 
rhythmic dances, folk-dances, hiking expeditions, etc., of 
the types in which well-trained children and youth indulge 
in the hours of their freedom. We are making this change, 
not because it is easier to manage or less expensive or more 
economical of time, for it is none of these things; but rather 
because physical experience upon the play-level is a more 
effective kind of physical education than spiritless mechan- 
ized physical exercises at word of command from which the 
play-spirit is absent. 
The social training likewise that we are introducing ‘into 
our schools is mainly upon the play-level. It is accomplished 
in connection with the plays and games, the social clubs, 
the dancing, the civic leagues, the Boy Scouts and the 
Camp-Fire Girls movements, and the general social life of 
the school. The greater the spontaneity, other things equal, 
the greater the values. 
To say that portions of serious education are to be on the 
order of play no longer shocks a practical-minded people 
as it once did. Our biology, psychology, and sociology have 
recently shown us the serious values of play and the vital 
function it has always performed and must perform in hu- 
man life. For whatever the field of man’s activity, it is this 
that lays the foundation for the serious, specialized matters 
that are to come later. It is man’s basic training, and in the 
present world of infinite complexity, demanding world-wide 
vision and sympathies, it needs to be full, rich, and extensive. 
We are also coming to recognize the value of harnessing 
up the play-motive when we wish strenuous exertion. It does 
not mean lack of effort; rather intensification of effort. A 
boy will play till he drops from fatigue, and do it all volun-
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE PLAY-LEVEL Wv 
tarily for the love of the cause. He will not voluntarily do 
that in his work, where the play-spirit is omitted. It is the 
boys or girls who enter with the greatest zest into the ac- 
tions of men as reconstructed in their histories, who take 
sides in the struggles, and who are warmed by their sympa- 
thetic and vicarious participation in the historical actions, 
who have most historical experience and get the greatest 
good from their history. It is the boy who wants to win in 
the spelling match who will manfully master the entire spell- 
ing book as a part of the game. The pupil who sees his mathe- 
matics as a series of interesting puzzles and games, is the one 
who will come nearest to conquering every difficulty that 
shows its head. The thing that one enjoys is the thing at 
which one will strain every nerve. Given a healthy play- 
motive and the right opportunity, it is like a high-power 
engine and a straight track ahead. 
We find here a partial answer to the contention that edu- 
cation on the basis of interest results in softness and flabbi- 
ness. Really it is the one who finds his educational pre- 
scriptions pieces of drudgery who most tries to evade them, 
consciously or unconsciously; and who consequently suf- 
fers from softness and flabbiness. The boys on the ath- 
letic fields who most enjoy their opportunities are the ones 
who most often over-develop physically; and later suffer 
therefrom. Interest-driven exercise is not only efficacious 
for developing fiber, but it must even be guarded against 
because of its over-efficacy where conditions are specially 
favorable. It is no less true in the intellectual realm. Find 
the student in mathematics or physics or Latin who has the 
best general command over the subject, who sees relations 
in clearest perspective, who has least intellectual flabbiness, 
— it is always one who delights in his studies in that field; 
one who loves the subject “for its own sake.” It is never the 
one for whom the experience is drudgery.

  CHAPTER III 
EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE UPON THE WORK-LEVEL 
Aurnouas play has its place in the process, education 
aims at preparation for the serious duties of life: one’s calling, 
the care of one’s health, civic codperations and regulation, 
bringin, up ) one’s uildren, keeping o1 el Ss language i in good 
form, et ‘ete. Educational experience upon the work-lével-is 
intended to prepare consciously for the efficient performance 
of these and all other serious duties, By work in this chapter 
we refer not merely to one’s calling, but to all of one’s 
responsible activities. 
Even one’s play has ends that are as serious as those of 
one’s work, for they are the same ends; but the relations are 
different. Although one may be unconscious at the time of 
the serious values of his play, Nature is thereby aiming 
definitely at his physical upbuilding, his mental expansion, 
and his social development. Neither the play-instincts nor 
the pleasures thereby occasioned are given as purposeless 
luxuries. The pleasure is not an end; it is a lure. It is a prim- 
itive method of impelling serious developmental activities 
where the intellect cannot be depended upon to direct the 
work. It is serious activity impelled by instinct; whereas 
work is serious activity impelled by ideas. The play is short- 
sighted; even blind in the face of modern conditions. Work 
when fully developed is far-sighted, clear-sighted, fully con- 
scious of ends and means. The accompanying diagram may 
assist in showing the identity of play and work ends, and 
also the differences in relationships. 
The figure shows four things, A, B, C, and D, all obviously 
involved in the preparation for, and performance of, re-

sponsible activities. Play is conscious of only the first; but 
this really looks to the second; the second is involved in the 
third; and the third then produces the fourth. As indicated

by following the arrows, the play, without the individual’s 
knowing it, is leading him toward the fruits of serious labors. 
But since he does not see the ends, there is no feeling of 
responsibility. 
Work-activity differs in that it looks consciously to all of 
the factors. It is conscious primarily of the fruits of the 
labors. Here is where the fundamental interest lies. This 
casts a derived interest back over the other factors since they 
are prerequisites. ‘The worker, while in training, has a 
double interest in the work-activities: the primary one is due 
to the fact that they produce the fruits that he is after; the 
secondary, that they further develop his powers to act, 
lifting them to higher levels of efficiency. He is then inter- 
ested in the general exercise of the play-level, not because 
of the pleasures thereby derived, but because of its value 
in developing the powers to think and act. 
The diagram shows the place in the total scheme of the 
two levels of educational experience. A represents experi- 
ences of the play-level; C those of the work-level. Both are 
factors in developing the individual’s work-powers. A comes
-P-A-G-E-28
  
20 THE CURRICULUM 
earlier and lays the foundations; and may continue through- 
out life alongside or mingled with the work for maintaining 
the foundations. C comes only after one has come to feel 
actual responsibility for serious results. It is not to be some- 
thing like work; it must be actual work. 
It must be observed that the work-level actually differen- 
tiates into two, because of the two types of fruits to be 
derived from the work-experiences. One may perform the 
work-activities (C) for the sake of the ultimate results (D) 
without consciousness of the educational effects (B). On the 
other hand, one may, from felt responsibility for final re- 
sults and consciousness of inferiority of his powers, perform 
the work-activities for the sake of the developmental re- 
sults (B) alone. These are as genuinely the fruits of the 
labors as the ultimate objective results. There cannot be 
felt responsibility, however, for these developmental work- 
results except as it is derived from a feeling of responsibility 
for securing the ultimate results. 
Whether _the work-experiences, therefore, look toward sub- 
jective or objective fruits, both interests and responsibilities 
relate primarily to the objective; and only in derived form to the 
subjective. The strength of the derived interests and responsi- 
bilities is determined by the strength of the primary ones.4Even. 
when. the developmental results are the things primarily sought 
by teachers in directing education, the students must be aiming 
primarily at the objective results, and only secondarily at the 
prerequisite developmental ones. 
An awakening education is everywhere coming to realize 
the need of work-activities as the only possible normal method 
of preparing for the work of the world. In the occupational 
field, we are developing schools and courses for trades, 
commerce, household occupations, agriculture, mining, etc., 
in special schools, continuation schools, and in general high 
schools. In the more progressive of these, there is every-
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE WORK-LEVEL 21 
where attempt to perform a real portion of the world’s work 
as the means of training. This may be accomplished by 
transferring a portion of the community’s occupational 
activities to the schools and having the work done there; 
or by distributing the students throughout the community, 
where they can find their work-experiences in those situa- 
tions provided by the work-activities of the adult world. 
Both plans are used. On the one hand, vocational activ- 
ities are being transferred to the schools, and the work done 
there under regular shop conditions involving genuine 
responsibility. Thus the boys in the shops, instead of the 
old-type manual training exercises, are engaged in manufac- 
turing school equipment, furniture, farming implements, 
playground apparatus, articles needed for Red Cross work 
and for community poor-relief, laboratory apparatus, electri- 
cal appliances for home use, etc. They are also in places 
doing actual community printing, milk-testing, seed-testing, 
repair-work on furniture, tools, machines and automobiles, 
cement construction, building portable houses, garages, 
gymnasiums, playground pavilions, etc. The girls, instead 
of formal cooking exercises, are nowadays more and more 
put to preparation of the daily school luncheon, home can- 
ning and preserving, sometimes doing baking for home use, 
or even for the general market. And their sewing is the mak- 
ing of actual garments. 
Sinceit is often difficult to transfer actual work-activities to 
the schools, another method is for the students to go out into 
the community where the work is being carried on by the 
adult world and there to share in the labors for training 
purposes. Although difficult enough to arrange and man- 
age, this is often the easier method of the two because of the 
frequent practical impossibility of transferring the actual 
responsibility to the schools. As a result of this recognition 
we are substituting home gardening for training purposes
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 THE CURRICULUM 
for the old ineffective school gardening; the home-project 
type of agriculture for the school farm; and part-time work 
in shops, stores, offices, etc., for mere drill exercises in school 
shops and commercial rooms. 
In training for citizenship, also, practical activities are 
being introduced. Pupils are helping to make the city clean, 
sanitary, and beautiful; to care for the city’s trees and shrub- 
bery; to prevent flies and mosquitoes; to protect the birds 
and to destroy noxious insects. They are engaged in making 
things for school or community use. Boy Scouts at times 
patrol dangerous street-crossings morning and afternoon to 
protect the little children going to and from school. School 
civic organizations are making local surveys of community 
conditions for responsible report to the authorities or to 
adult civic organizations. 
For practical hygienic training, pupils are often made re- 
sponsible for some portion of the school ventilation, building 
cleanliness and sanitation, the regulation of temperature, 
humidity, and sunlight. Through the school medical depart- 
ment and through giving credit for home work, children are 
stimulated to outside practical hygienic activities: home 
ventilation and sanitation, cleansing the teeth, rational 
choice of foods, regulation of sleeping conditions and hours, 
adjustment of exercise to needs, care of the eyes, etc. 
In the pupil’s language, also, we are introducing the work- 
motive of felt responsibility. Pupils are brought to aim at 
social results that for attainment require a correct and ef- « 
fective type of language. This compels them to see their 
language as a work-activity employed for getting results. 
Responsibility for ends then impels them to watchfulness and 
effort in organizing their thought, in paragraph and sen- 
tence construction, in choice of words, pronunciation, spell- 
ing, handwriting, ete. They are given the opportunities in 
problem-solving, oral reports, written reports, letters, news
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE WORK-LEVEL 23 
items, communications to civic organizations, applications 
for position, debates, social-club activities, etc. 
But after enumerating all of these things we must con- 
fess that professional vision is far in advance of professional 
practice. For really, except for the language field, taking 
schools the country over, there is not much training experi- 
ence of genuine work-type, the criterion being felt respon- 
sibility for serious results. Even trade-school experiences are 
most often exercises in isolation from the world’s actual work. 
Far more is this the case with courses bearing vocational 
names in the general schools; and with training for citizen- 
ship, hygiene, and sanitation. The list of things being done 
somewhere in the country is very long; but it is a rare school 
system that has found a ‘way so to share in community work- 
responsibility as to secure a sufficient portion of actual work- 
experience for training purposes. 
There is insufficient realization of the need or the legit- 
imacy for public education of actual work-experiences. 
Even yet our schools appear to be well-named from the old 
Greek word schole, meaning leisure. In the main, education 
in grammar grades, high school, and college of liberal arts 
— we except the mastery of the school arts in the elementary 
school and the training in professional and technical schools 
— is yet a life of leisure. Teachers are often able to prevent 
students’ enjoying it; but that does not make the activity 
an organic portion of the world’s work, which is set aside for 
training youth in the processes of that work. 
In technological and professional schools we have long 
recognized the need of work-activities. Young physicians 
in training are helpers in hospitals; engineering students have 
field and shop work; agricultural students, work on the 
school farm; but even in these schools the amount of work- 
experience is usually felt to be inadequate. This is revealed 
by such a movement as that in the University of Cincinnati,
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 THE CURRICULUM 
where the students in mechanical engineering have been given 
opportunity to work half-time in manufacturing establish- 
ments of the city, bearing actual responsibilities and receiv- 
ing wages for their work. This is to provide work-experience 
that is genuine in character and adequate in quantity. 
The need of work for training has long been understood 
by the skilled trades. The apprenticeship system trained 
through experiences of the work-type. The recent agita- 
tion for vocational training in public schools is due, not to a 
new need, but to new conditions. The apprenticeship sys- 
tem, never very efficient, has broken down in the face of 
complicated conditions. Public education is coming to the 
rescue. But even though we organize schools for the purpose, 
‘we must no less than in the old days include actual work- 
experience. Indeed, we must now have a greater quantity 
of responsible work than was provided by the old apprentice- 
ship system, because of the greater present complexity 
of work and of the higher levels of efficiency to be reached. 
And it must be not less real than the old. 
Finding work-experience for training presented no diffi- 
culty to the apprenticeship system. It had little else to pro- 
vide. But that is just the thing that has been most absent 
from public education. Schools have been places of leisure 
occupations; not places where the world’s work is being per- 
formed. They can provide any amount of experience on the 
play-level. But they are not in command of the world’s 
work-activities, whether production, distribution, civic regu- 
lation, community sanitation, or other. In their traditional 
form they are therefore not in a position to provide much 
training on the work-level. Hence, education requires a pro- 
found transformation before it is able to take adequate care 
of work-experience as training for work. Schools must be- 
come sharers in the world’s work of every kind by way of 
finding the only possible training opportunities. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE WORK-LEVEL 25 
way even in kindergarten and primary grades. The expan- 
sion of the pupils’ understanding of ends and means will be 
gradual up through the grades. It ought to be fairly full by 
é later years of the high school — in spite of present usual 
practices to the contrary. It is not unreasonable to sup- 
pose that it should be dominant on the college level — again 
in spite of current contrary practices. The academic tend- 
ency has been to delay educational activities of the work- 
type. They have been withheld from college students until 
the professional schools have been reached; and from most 
high-school students until they reach technical schools, or 
the school of the world’s work. This is the way of ease and 
economy; but the world is rapidly coming to think it a 
mistake.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE PLACE OF IDEAS IN WORK-EXPERIENCE 
Even the crude activities of the past were directed by 
ideas. The farmer in his fields, the machinist at his lathe, 
the housewife at her cooking, the citizen in arriving at judg- 
ments of public affairs, or in staving off disease, —.all con- 
sidered the conditions before them, and applied the means 
and processes that appeared to them the most rational. But 
they lacked accurate scientific knowledge of the factors in- 
volved. The ideas that they put to work were crude; and 
that is why their labors were crude and inefficient. The 
thought or subjective part of the work is the work essen- 
tially. One indispensable thing for making work efficient is 
a full supply of accurate scientific information concerning 
all the factors. The second thing is a correct performance of 
the ideational portion of the practical work. Let us begin 
with the latter and call it 
The antecedent performance 
( The practical performance of any task divides itself natu- 
rally into two parts. First, there is the planning of the 
work: making decisions as to exact objectives and as to the 
specific materials and processes to be employed. This task 
involves performance in imagination of the entire labor from 
incipiency to finished product. It involves marshaling all 
of one’s science relative to both objectives and processes; 
and drawing plans as dictated by the science. One must also 
test out in imagination each step in the series to see that 
everything fits into everything else, and that there is no 
contradiction, interference, or other obstacle. 
Any complete task will serve to illustrate. Let us take
-P-A-G-E-35
  PLACE OF IDEAS IN WORK-EXPERIENCE 7 
the case of the boy in the machine-shop who sets out to con- 
struct a gas-engine. He first constructs it in his imagination. 
This antecedent construction involves all of the parts, sizes, 
designs, and relations. In this way, without any risk or 
waste of materials, he may construct it over and over again, 
to see that there are no mistakes, no interference of parts, 
and no insurmountable difficulties. He may construct it in 
many ways, using different designs, sizes of parts, or pro- 
portions; and he may test out each design in order to deter- 
mine the working plan that seems best. For these antece- 
dent labors, he must mobilize all of his science and put it 
to work both in the planning and the testing. His thought 
may be concentrated into a few hours or distributed over 
months. But when this antecedent construction and testing 
are satisfactorily accomplished and decision made, the more 
fundamental portion of the work is done: There remains 
the objectification of his plans. This is not mere mechan- 
ical registration of his decisions. Back of his hands, his 
thought is still busy directing, guiding, and supervising. 
His hands are the tools of his intellect. Such manual labors, 
before being mechanized into habit, —a later process, — 
are essentially intellectual labors. 
This must be emphasized because of the frequent tend- 
ency in the training to commit one or the other of two 
fundamental errors. One is to leave out a large portion of 
the ideational element, by giving ready-made plans to the 
students which they are simply to follow: shop-manuals, 
books of recipes, blue-print plans, ready-made patterns, 
detailed directions. In such case pupils may get practically 
no vision of the controlling science, and are not even put- 
ting second-hand ideas to work. They may get nothing 
more than ideas of mechanical manipulation without any 
insight into the reasons for the processes. As training 
experience, it is barren and ineffective. |
-P-A-G-E-36
    28 THE CURRICULUM 
The opposite error is the attempt to teach the science 
without any relation to the work-situations. This no more 
than the other is putting ideas to work; it is therefore not 
intellectual work-experience. It may accomplish much as 
intellectual play. Practical experience proves that it lays a 
good foundation for later actual work-training, — as where 
the man trained in “pure” science goes into practical in- 
dustry, and rapidly gets his next level of training. We do 
not deny that the play-level provides an excellent founda- 
tion for training of the work-type; we have everywhere 
affirmed it. But it is not training on the work-level. And 
in the degree in which the latter is necessary, the experience 
is incomplete, inefficient, unfocused, fails to provide work- 
valuations, work-habits, attitudes, and sense of responsi- 
bility. As a method of training for serious duties, it too is 
ineffective. : 
We must point out an important difference between the 
antecedent or subjective performance of the act and the 
later objective performance. In the former, one draws on 
all his ideas that are in any way related to the task in hand. 
If he has abundant ideas and a fertile imagination, he may 
be brought into contact with about every important thing 
in the field. He comes to know the science and properly to 
value it, as he thus chooses the things that can serve his 
purposes and rejects those that are of no service. The plan- 
ning, the antecedent performance of the task, is, therefore, 
from an educational point of view, the most important 
part of it. But it cannot have vitality for education unless 
it is really antecedent to intended action; unless it is an 
organic portion of a total act of which the outward perform- 
ance is but the culminating portion. 
On the other hand, after decisions are made, plans drawn, 
and only execution remaining, then one’s mental life is 
much narrowed. It is concerned intensively with the one
-P-A-G-E-37
PLACE OF IDEAS IN WORK-EXPERIENCE 29 
design that has been decided upon, the one set of materials 
and methods. This culminating activity has many educa- 
tional values: it gives motive and substantiality to the whole 
process; it gives depth to one’s understanding and appreci- 
ations; it confers operative skill. But it cannot be compared 
with the antecedent labors for giving width of intellectual 
vision. 
The pupil must, therefore, not be robbed of the_antecedent 
performance _by- having-the-finished-plans~preseribed by the 
teacher or by a class manual. 
The antecedent performance possesses another important 
value. Novices will not acquire a sense of responsibility 
unless they are forced to take the initiative, to make plans 
and decisions for themselves, and to bear the responsibility 
of making the plans successful. But with novices, this in- 
volves mistakes, waste of materials, and losses. Since pen- 
alty alone can enforce responsibility, and since loss is the 
normal penalty of mistakes, serious waste appears to be the 
price of initiative and responsibility, — if they are to be 
real, and not merely make-believe. 
We have a way out of the difficulty as we distinguish be- 
tween antecedent and culminating performance; and as we 
develop educational technique appropriate to the two. 
Full and complete initiative can be given : 
cedent performance of the action. Then, “before the steps 
planned are actually taken, they can be reviewed, step by 
step, as frequently as necessary by the student by way of 
seeing that no mistake is involved. Plans can be taken up 
in class discussion, and tried out in the critical testing imagi- 
nation of teacher and pupils. Serious defects will thus be 
discovered. Mistakes can be seen before they are made 
actual. Losses can be realized, and the penalty enforced in 
imagination sufficiently to restrain wrong action. As a 
matter of fact, this is the way Nature enforces her penalties 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
    30 THE CURRICULUM 
most of the time in the case of the successful man. He is 
successful because he anticipates mistakes and corrects 
them before they are made. The unsuccessful man is the 
one of narrower vision and duller imagination who does 
not see his mistakes until he is injured or crushed beneath , 
them. “Experience is the best teacher.” But experience in : 
anticipating mistakes and correcting them before they are 
made is a better teacher than loss and injury. The plan 
demands full development of the technique of antecedent 
performance. 
The technical information 
On the work-level, the task to be performed is central; 
and the science is organized about it. A boy, for example, 
in the school shop wishes to construct and operate a tele- 
graphic apparatus. This ambition will serve as the center 
of the science training. He will be motivated to gather 
information concerning batteries, wiring, electro-magnets, 
making and breaking of circuits, ete. He will learn just the 
things that he needs for the task in hand; and nothing more 
at the time. Through using his ideas in the planning and in 
the actual construction he comes to realize the full signifi- 
cance of the various facts. The derived interest aroused is 
for most individuals more potent than the native interest 
in the abstract science facts and principles. For this reason 
the knowledge is more effectively driven home and remem- 
bered. 
There is a strong drift in public education toward this 
project-method of organization. The school corn clubs, for 
example, assemble all possible information relative to the 
growth of corn and use it for the control of practical pro- 
cedure. Children engaged in an anti-mosquito campaign 
assemble just the entomological, bacteriological, and other 
information needed in their labors, rejecting for the moment
-P-A-G-E-39
  PLACE OF IDEAS IN WORK-EXPERIENCE 31 
all irrelevant scientific information. The tree-protecting 
league gathers all possible facts concerning the species of 
trees attacked by insects, fungi, etc., together with the 
scientific information needed for combating the destructive 
influences. They reject for the time all botanical or ento- 
mological information that has no bearing on the problem 
in hand. In weeding out the grammatical mistakes made 
by children in their speech, the grammatical information is 
assembled that relates to the specific mistakes found; all 
other grammatical facts are passed by as irrelevant. In 
brief, one learns the things needed for directing action in 
connection with the situations in which the action is to take 
place, and just previous to the drawing-up of the plans. 
Gnly under such circumstances can knowledge properly 
reveal its significance, be rightly focused upon human 
affairs, or be normally assimilated. Knowing and doing 
should grow up together. 
In spite of these virtues, the project-method as a mode of 
teaching science is not always in good repute. This is not 
due to any inherent defect in the method — when it is 
complete. It is by far the most complicated method; and 
differs most from familiar traditional ones. It is not, there- 
fore, surprising that teachers often develop an incomplete 
and ineffective form of the method. Whenever a training 
task involves practical performance, this is so visible, 
tangible, and solid to sense that it often comes to be con- 
ceived as being the whole thing. The teacher attempts to 
get the pupils in the most economical and expeditious way 
to perform the practical actions by way of securing the re- 
sults. The teachers, therefore, often do the thinking, draw 
up the plans, and prescribe procedure for the students. This 
is exceedingly common in sewing-rooms, kitchens, and shops. 
So far as the pupils’ experience is concerned, the intellectual 
element is largely dropped out. In such case the pupils do 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  82 THE CURRICULUM 
not themselves perform the most vital portion of the work. 
The part given over to them does not require that they 
master the science involved for the sake of planning and 
self-guidance. , * 
The technique of the project-method requires that in the 
teaching the major attention be given to what we have 
called the antecedent performance rather than to the 
objective or culminating performance. It also requires that 
the antecedent activities be performed by the students. 
In the use of this method the necessary ideas are to be 
got from at least three places. To make the matters clear 
let us resume our illustration of the gas-engine: — 
1. In the first place, the boy, motivated by intention to 
make the engine, will observe such engines in as great vari- 
ety as available. For fullness of understanding, he should 
operate them, and see the workings of the parts. He should 
take them to pieces, and reassemble them. This experience 
brings him into direct contact with all the science realities 
involved — the first vital step in learning science. After he 
has thus experienced the realities, he is prepared to isolate 
them, verbalize them, and appreciate quantitative rela- 
tions. The situation does not contain all that he needs for 
these latter purposes, and certainly not enough for full 
scientific generalizations; but the things it contains he needs 
as part of the total process. 
2. In the second place, he will read descriptions, pictures, 
drawings, and diagrams of engines that he has not seen, by 
way of extending his vision of possibility. If he can have 
direct access to-two or three types of actual engines, he will 
have an apperception-alphabet that will enable him easily 
and quickly through reading to examine another ten or 
twenty types. It would be well in such case to begin with 
the historically earliest and simplest types, noting both the 
structures and the science involved; then to trace the  
-P-A-G-E-41
  PLACE OF IDEAS IN WORK-EXPERIENCE 33 
changes that have been made by way of improvement and 
of adaptation to special needs, and reasons for these changes. 
When this experience is added, he is provided with a better 
basis for generalizations. But probably even this is not 
enough. ‘ 
8. For illustrating the third step, let us isolate the single 
feature of the ignition system. Instead of further widening 
his understanding of the electrical science involved by look- 
ing to still more engines, — there is a limit beyond which 
little or nothing new appears, — he might look off and view 
the wide field of electricity in general and its applications 
in general. He is still motivated, let us say, by his project 
of developing an improved type of .ignition system. He 
reads a full treatise on electricity and its applications. Where 
his apperception is defective, he tries things out in the labo- 
ratory. But, though taking a full survey of the “pure” 
science, he is only sorting over the possibilities of the field, 
locating suggestions, trying to find the ideas that he can 
put to work. This pure-science overview is the ultimate 
level of project-science experience. 
While in a sense this is “‘pure”’ science, it is very different 
from the usual non-functional type. Here the primary 
thing in the student’s consciousness is the project, the piece 
of work to be done; not the satisfaction of intellectual inter- 
ests. He examines every fact and principle in relation to 
his practical problem, and not merely as a field of intel- 
lectual sight-seeing. The two types of experience differ as 
play differs from work.

  CHAPTER V 
WHERE EDUCATION CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED 
Epucavionan experiences must take place where they 
can be normal. Frequently this is not at the schools. 
The nature of the problem can be made clear by illustra- 
tions of varying character. Let us take first the case of the 
training of girls in sewing. The practical activities will 
transfer to the schools with ease. The continuing need of 
garments and other household necessities involving needle- 
work gives rise to the normal responsibilities. While the 
activities may take place in the individual homes, the 
teacher going about from home to home to supervise it, the 
plan is not administratively economical. The schools can 
easily provide the simple appliances needed. The materials 
can be carried to the schools as easily as books, and the 
practical labors performed there as normally as at home. 
When tasks can be so transferred without loss of normal 
responsibility, this is administratively desirable. 
The training in home cooking will not transfer with any 
such ease. Food materials are bulky, and not easily carried 
to the school for the work, nor easily returned to the homes. 
They are perishable, easily subject to contamination in 
transit, and often should be served as soon as preparation 
is complete. Most of the practical activities therefore must 
take place in the home kitchen, not in the school kitchen. 
For supervising it, teachers need to be in intimate contact 
with the homes. A few such cooking tasks can be trans- 
ferred to the schools at times, as for example, certain special 
baking, a portion of the canning, preserving, jelly-making, 
etc. These can occasionally be performed at the school and 
the product then returned to the homes of the girls.
-P-A-G-E-43
  
WHERE EDUCATION CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED 35 
Owing to the difficulty of providing normal responsibili- 
ties, and therefore normal training conditions, many 
schools at present are using a substitute. The preparation 
of the school luncheon is used to provide responsible train- 
ing conditions. The girls in relays provide daily one or two 
dishes for the luncheon. In other cases they prepare lunch- 
eons for the teachers, regularly or occasionally. In a few 
schools they even go so far as to provide an entire noonday 
meal each day including a dozen or more dishes, served 
cafeteria-fashion for several hundred students. When a 
needed activity will not transfer, it is thus possible occa- 
sionally to find a sufficient substitute that is not mere make- 
believe. 
Recognition of the necessity of normal responsibility as 
a factor of educational situations is a relatively recent devel- 
opment. Not many years ago it was felt, for example, that 
training in gardening could be given in our little school 
gardens. Recently it has been discovered that in so far as 
the school garden omits normal responsibility for securing 
actual results that are to be used in serious ways, it is but a 
play-garden. As such it is of value for preliminary training 
of the play-type. It can introduce the subject and give 
some beginning ideas as to gardening; and it can serve for 
demonstration and experimental procedure; but it is in- 
sufficient for serious training. It is being discovered that 
gardening responsibility transfers to the school only with 
great difficulty, and that therefore the training should take 
place in the home gardens with the teacher going about. 
from home to home to supervise the work. The training 
needs to be taken care of where the work can be normal, not 
where it may be most convenient for teachers. 
Formerly we thought we could train machinists and car- 
penters in our high-school manual-training shops. Now we 
see that our shops of the usual type provide play-situations, 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
36 THE CURRICULUM 
not work-situations. The constructive instinct is strong in 
boys, and whether in school or not their play inclines them 
to constructive activities. The usual school shop offers’ 
these instincts a favorable outlet. This is of large value. 
Constructive play, distributed from kindergarten to high 
school, is a highly profitable training of the preliminary 
type. It introduces novices to the field of serious mechanical 
occupations. It can carry them but a portion of the way, 
however. After such introduction the thing needed is re- 
sponsible work, where the boy can participate in serious 
mechanical activities, under actual working conditions. 
The practical responsible aspects of shop training will 
transfer to the schools under present conditions only with 
great difficulty. It is scarcely possible to organize in any 
sufficient way at our schools actual machine-shop produc- 
tion or the actual building of houses. At the school only 
preliminary, laboratory, and demonstration portions can _ 
be taken care of. The culminating portions of the educative 
process are to be found out in the world of responsible in- 
dustry. To that must the students be sent for the later 
levels of their mechanical training. 
Our schools have tried to train for health by imparting 
textbook and lecture information concerning matters of 
anatomy, physiology, and hygiene. If the children got the 
facts in mind well enough to recite and pass the examina- 
tions, they were considered educated. Application of the 
information has been looked upon as a thing to be done by 
the pupils only after the examination has attested the com- 
pleteness of their education. The application has been looked 
upon as being in no sense a part of the training process; 
certainly not a part of the school’s responsibility. Recently 
we are becoming better informed. We are discovering that 
the application of the information is the culminating process 
of education; that without the processes in which the knowl-  
-P-A-G-E-45
  WHERE EDUCATION CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED 87 
edge is put to work, education is only half done. We are 
coming to see that education in hygiene is accomplished, 
not in the moments of acquiring the preliminary technical 
information at the school, but in the moments of using that 
information in the control of conduct; and in the recurring 
moments of such actual use of knowledge while health habits are 
being fixed. The training is accomplished as one puts his 
ideas to work in the ventilation of his sleeping-room; in his 
choice of food; in caring for his teeth; in keeping up his mus- 
cular strength and tone, in work and play; in evading 
bacterial infection; and in the countless other matters in 
which he is called upon to act. 
Most of these hygienic training activities will not transfer 
to the school. The training has to be accomplished where 
the activity can take place normally. The school can give 
necessary antecedent information; it can aid students in 
forming judgments as to what to do; it can through teachers 
and school nurses codperate with parents in stimulating 
and supervising the activities of the students; but in most 
cases the self-directed activities that round out and fix the 
training cannot be transferred to the schools. The home- 
visiting health-nurse in continual contact with the home 
situations in which the pupils live is the one ideally situated 
for supervising the culminating aspects of the training. 
When in later chapters we look at the responsible activi- 
ties involved in training for citizenship, for leisure occupa- 
tions, for parenthood, for religion, for social intercommuni- 
cation, etc., we shall discover that in most fields of training 
there are some of the culminating activities that transfer 
to the schools with entire ease; that there are others which 
transfer with difficulty; and that there are still others which 
will not transfer at all. It will be found, too, that the rela- 
tive value of any aspect of training is in no wise related to 
the place where it has to be carried on. Very mauy activi-
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 THE CURRICULUM 
ties most urgently needed can be transferred to the schools 
only with great difficulty, or not at all. Education is no less 
imperative, however, simply because of this difficulty or 
impossibility of transfer. Our profession must find ways of 
going out to the activities that cannot be brought to the 
schools. This is now being done in part-time work, in giving 
credit for home activities, and in school-club work of various 
kinds. 
A good example comes from Iowa. The bulletin of the 
Iowa Home-Work School-Credit Club enumerates three 
hundred and thirty home activities of wide diversity for 
which credit is given. It is unfortunate that space precludes 
the presentation of the entire list; but the following table 
shows the number of activities of each class for which credit 
is given: —

WHERE EDUCATION CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED 39 
Naturally such non-transferable activities require direc- 
tion and supervision. Much of this is to be taken care of at 
the school building in the antecedent planning for the activi- 
ties. This involves the previous mastery of the necessary 
information. So far as possible the children will do their 
own planning and thus know what they are about. If the 
antecedent portions of the activity are fully taken care of, 
the need of personal supervision is greatly diminished. But 
pupils need leadership and encouragement. While parents 
here have a part to perform, the major responsibility rests 
upon the teachers. It demands that they mingle in the 
community life and come into contact with their pupils 
while the latter are securing their educative experiences. 
As teachers educate for efficient performance of life’s affairs, 
they must be a portion of the active world of affairs. In the 
degree in which the experience itself cannot be transferred 
to the classroom, in this degree the teacher himself cannot 
be placed within a classroom for directing the work. 
The part-time school or course is another practical recog- 
nition of the fact that, where normal experience cannot be 
transferred to the school, the children must be sent to the 
places where such normal experience can be had. In such 
well-known examples as those of Cincinnati or Fitchburg, 
the boys in the shop courses spend one half of the school 
year in the classes, laboratories, and shops of the high schools 
and the other half of the school year in the shops of the 
city, doing real work for wages under shop foremen. The 
plan is worked out by having two boys assigned to one job 
in the shop. Each boy works a week in the shop and a week 
in the school alternately. When one is in the shop the 
other is in the school; both are in the shop on Saturdays. 
This part-time activity can be indefinitely extended; and: 
the extension is at present being actually and rapidly made. 
The young men in the shops of high schools and industrial  
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 THE CURRICULUM 
schools are being used by the educational authorities of 
certain cities in taking care of the repairs upon school build- 
ings and school equipment, under the direction of responsi- 
ble repair foremen. In a technical high school recently vis- 
ited, the boys in the agricultural class had contracted with 
the fruit-growers of the region roundabout to care for the 
orchards for a certain price per year. They went out Satur- 
days, holidays, vacations, and did the spraying, pruning, 
cultivation, harvesting, etc., under the conditions of normal 
responsibility. Arrangements are being made in many 
places whereby students in typewriting, bookkeeping, sales- 
manship, advertising, window-dressing, etc., work for a few 
hours per week or certain weeks during the year on part- 
time work within commercial establishments. 
We discover here a further administrative reason for 
making clear distinction between the antecedent portion 
and the objective portion of practical action. The planning 
and all the preparation incident thereto can in practically 
all cases be most economically and effectively taken care 
of at the schools. The actual putting of ideas to work under 
responsible conditions must be accomplished in the diverse 
and scattered situations where those conditions obtain. 
Administratively this actual accomplishment often presents 
difficult problems. In the degree, however, in which the 
antecedent portion has been adequately performed, these 
difficulties are minimized. The novices when they go out 
find themselves prepared to put the right ideas to work; 
to do the things with confidence; to do them correctly; and 
with little supervision. The world knows how to use that 
kind of ability.

CHAPTER VI 
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN CURRICULUM-MAKING 
Tue technique of curriculum-making along scientific lines 
has been but little developed. The controlling purposes of 
education have not been sufficiently particularized. We 
have aimed at a vague culture, an ill-defined discipline, a 
nebulous harmonious development of the individual, an 
indefinite moral character-building, an unparticularized 
social efficiency, or, often enough nothing more than escape 
from a life of work. Often there are no controlling purposes; 
the momentum of the educational machine keeps it running. 
So long as objectives are but vague guesses, or not even 
that, there can be no demand for anything but vague 
guesses as to means and procedure. But the era of content- 
ment with large, undefined purposes is rapidly passing. An 
age of science is demanding exactness and particularity. 
The technique of scientific method is at present being 
developed for every important aspect of education. Experi- 
mental laboratories and schools are discovering accurate 
methods of measuring and evaluating different types of 
educational processes. Bureaus of educational measure- 
ment are discovering scientific methods of analyzing results, 
of diagnosing specific situations, and of prescribing remedies. 
Scientific method is being applied to the fields of budget- 
making, child-accounting, systems of grading and promo- 
tion, etc. 
The curriculum, however, is a primordial factor. If it is 
wrongly drawn up on the basis merely of guess and personal 
opinion, all of the science in the world applied to the factors 
above enumerated will not make the work efficient. The 
scientific task preceding all others is the determination of 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 THE CURRICULUM 
the curriculum. For this we need a scientific technique. At 
present this is being rapidly developed in connection with 
various fields of training. 
, The central theory is simple. Human life, however varied, 
msists in the performance of specific activities. Education 
that prepares for life is one that prepares definitely and 
adequately for these specific activities. However numerous 
. and diverse they may be for any social class, they can be dis- 
covered. This requires only that one go out into the world 
of affairs and discover the particulars‘of which these affairs 
consist. These will show the abilities, attitudes, habits, 
Appreciations, and forms of knowledge that men need. 
Vv _ These will be the objectives of the curriculum. They will 
be numerous, definite, and particularized. The curriculum 
will then be that series of experiences which children and 
youth must have by way of attaining those objectives. 
, ( The word curriculum is Latin for a racé-course, or the race 
itself, — a place of deeds, or a series of deeds. As applied 
| to education, it is that series of things which children and 
| | youth must do and experience by way of developing abilities 
| to do the things well that make up the affairs of adult life; 
\and to be in all respects what adults should be. 
The developmental experiences exist upon two levels. On 
the one hand, there is the general experience of living the 
community life, without thought of the training values. In 
this way, through participation, one gets much of his edu- 
cation for participation in community life.; In many things 
this provides most of the training; and irrall essential things, 
much of it. But in all fields, this incidental or undirected 
developmental experience leaves the training imperfect. It 
is necessary, therefore, to supplement it with the conscious 
directed training of systematized education. The first level 
we shall call undirected training; and the second, directed 
training.
-P-A-G-E-51
  CURRICULUM-MAKING 43 
1) it is the entire range of experiences, both undirected and} 
directed, concerned in unfolding the abilities of the indi; 
idual; or (2) it is the series of consciously directed training 
experiences that the schools use for completing and per- 
fecting the unfoldment. Our profession uses the term usu- 
ally in the latter sense. But as education is coming more 
and more to be seen as a thing of experiences, and as the 
work- and play-experiences of the general community life 
are being more and more utilized, the line of demarcation 
between directed and undirected training experience is 
rapidly disappearing. Education must be concerned with 
both, even though it does not direct both. 
When the curriculum is defined as including both di- 
rected and undirected experiences, then its objectives are 
the total range of human abilities, habits, systems of knowl- 
edge, etc., that one should possess. These will be discovered 
by analytic survey. The curriculum-discoverer will first be 
an analyst of human nature and of human affairs. His 
task at this point is not at all concerned with “the studies,” 
— later he will draw up appropriate studies as means, but 
_he will not analyze the tools to be used in a piece of work 
V as a mode of discovering the objectives of that work. His 
’ first task rather, in ascertaining the education appropriate 
for any special class, is to discover the total range of habits, 
skills, abilities, forms of thought, valuations, ambitions, 
etc.,. that its members need for the effective performance 
of their vocational labors; likewise, the total range needed 
for their civic activities; their health activities; their recrea- 
tions; their language; their parental, religious, and general 
social activities. The program of analysis will be no narrow 
one. It will be wide as life itself. As it thus finds all the 
things that make up the mosaic of full-formed human life, 
it discovers the full range of educational objectives. (« The curriculum may, therefore, be defined in two ways} 
( 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 THE CURRICULUM 
Notwithstanding the fact that many of these objectives 
are attained without conscious effort, the curriculum-dis- 
coverer must have all of them before him for his labors. 
Even though the scholastic curriculum will not find it 
necessary to aim at all of them, it is the function of educa- 
tion to see that all of them are attained. Only as he looks 
to the entire series can he discover the ones that require 
conscious effort. He will be content to let as much as pos- 
sible be taken care of through undirected experiences. In- 
deed he will strive for such conditions that a maximum 
amount of the training can be so taken care of. 
The curriculum of the schools will aim at those objectives 
that are not sufficiently attained as a result of the general un- 
directed experience. This is to recognize that the total range 
of specific educational objectives breaks up into two sets: 
one, those arrived at through one’s general experiences 
without his taking thought as to the training; the other, 
those that are imperfectly or not.at all attained through 
such. general experience. The latter are revealed, and dis- 
tinguished from the former, by the presence of ‘imperfec- 
tions, errors, short-comings. Like the symptoms of disease, 
these point unerringly to those objectives that require the 
systematized labors of directed training. Deficiencies point 
to the ends of conscious education. As the specific objec- 
tives upon which education is to be focused are thus pointed 
out, we are shown where the curriculum of the directed 
training is to be developed. 
Let us illustrate. One of the most important things in 
which one is to be trained is the effective use of the mother- 
tengue. It is possible to analyze one’s language activities 
and find all of the things one must do in effectively and 
) correctly using it. Each of these things then becomes an 
objective of the training. But it is not necessary consciously 
to train for each of them. Let an individual grow up in a
-P-A-G-E-53
CURRICULUM-MAKING 45 
cultivated language-atmosphere, and he will learn to do, 
and be sufficiently practiced in doing, most of them, without 
any directed training. Here and there he will make mis- 
takes. Each mistake is a call for directed training. 
The curriculum of the directed training is to be discovered in 
the shortcomings of individuals after they have had all that can 
be given by the undirected training. 
This principle is recognized in the recent work of many 
investigators as to the curriculum of grammar. One of the 
earliest studies was that of Professor Charters. Under his 
direction, the teachers of Kansas City undertook to dis- 
cover the errors made by pupils in their oral and written 
language. For the oral errors the teachers carried notebooks 
for five days of one week and jotted down every grammatical 
error which they heard made by any pupil at any time dur- 
ing the day. For the errors in writing they examined the 
written work of the pupils for a period of three weeks. They 
discovered twenty-one types of errors in the oral speech 
and twenty-seven types in the written. The oral errors 
in the order of their frequency were as follows: —

Each error discovered is a symptom of grammatical igno- 
rance, wrong habit, imperfect valuation, or careless attitude 
toward one’s language. The nature of the deficiency points 
to the abilities and dispositions that are to be developed in 
the child by way of bringing about the use of the correct 
forms. (Each grammatical shortcoming discovered, there- 
fore, points to a needed objective of education. It points 
to a development of knowledge or attitude which the gen- 
eral undirected language experience has not sufficiently 
accomplished; and which must therefore be consciously 
undertaken by the oe 
Scientific method must consider both levels of the gram- 
mar curriculum. One task is to provide at the school as 
much as possible of a cultivated language-atmosphere in 
which the children can live and receive unconscious train- 
ing. This is really the task of major importance, and pro- 
vides the type of experience that should accomplish an ever- 
increasing proportion of the training. The other task is to 
make children conscious of their errors, to teach the gram- 
mar needed for correction or prevention, and to bring the 
children to put their grammatical knowledge to work in 
eliminating the errors. In proportion as the other type of 
experience is increased, this conscious training will play a 
diminishing réle.
-P-A-G-E-55
  CURRICULUM-MAKING 47 
‘In the spelling field, Ayres, Jones, Cook and O’Shea, and 
pthers have been tabulating the words that children and 
adults use in writing letters, reports, compositions, ete. In 
this way they have been discovering the. particularized 
objectives of training in spelling. But words are of unequal 
difficulty. Most are learned in the course of the reading and 
writing experience of the children without much conscious 
attention to the spelling. But here and there are words 
that are not so learned. Investigations, therefore, lay spe- 
cial emphasis’upon the words that are misspelled. Each 
misspelled word reveals a directed-curriculum task. Here, 
_ as in the grammar, error is the symptom of training need; 
and the complete error-list points unerringly to the curricu- 
lum of conscious training. 
In the vocational field, and on the technical side only, 
Indianapolis has provided an excellent example of method 
of discovering the objectives of training. Investigators, 
without pre-suppositions as to content of vocational curricu- 
lum, set out to discover the major occupations of the city, 
the processes to be performed in each, and the knowledge, 
habits and skills needed for effective work. They talked 
with expert workmen; and observed the work-processes. 
, In their report, for each occupation, they present: (1) a list 
of tools and machines with which a workman must be skill- 
ful; (2) a list of the materials used in the work with which 
' workers need to be familiar; (8) a list of items of general 
knowledge needed concerning jobs and processes; (4) the 
kinds of mathematical operations actually employed in the 
work; (5) the items or portions of science needed for control 
of processes; (6) the elements of drawing and design actu- 
ally used in the work; (7) the characteristics of the English 
needed where language is vitally involved in one’s work, as 
in commercial occupations; (8) elements of hygiene needed 
for keeping one’s self up to the physical standards demanded 
by the work; and (9) the needed facts of economics. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 THE CURRICULUM 
Many of the things listed in such a survey are learned 
through incidental experience. Others cannot be sufficiently 
learned in this way. It is by putting the workers to work, 
whether adolescent or adult, and by noting the kinds of 
shortcomings and mistakes that show themselves when 
training is absent or deficient, that we can discover the 
curriculum tasks for directed vocational education. 
The objectives of education are not to be discovered within 
just any kind or quality of human affairs. Occupational, 
civic, sanitary, or other activity may be poorly performed 
and productive of only meager results. At the other end of 
the scale are types of activity that are as well performed as 
it is in human nature to perform them, and which are abun- 
dantly fruitful in good results. Education is established 
upon the presumption that human activities exist upon 
different levels of quality or efficiency; that performance of 
low character is not good; that it can be eliminated through 
training; and that only the best or at least the best attain- 
able is good enough. Whether in agriculture, building- 
trades, housekeeping, commerce, civic regulation, sanitation, 
or any other, education presumes that the best that is prac- 
ticable is what ought to be. Education is to keep its feet 
squarely upon the earth; but this does not require that it 
aim lower than the highest that is practicable. 
Let us take a concrete illustration. The curriculum- 
discoverer wishes, for example, to draw up a course of train- 
ing in agriculture. He will go out into the practical world of 
agriculture as the only place that can reveal the objectives 
of agricultural education. He will start out without pre- 
judgment as to the specific objectives. All that he needs for 
the work is pencil, notebook, and a discerning intelligence. 
He will observe the work of farmers; he will talk with them 
about all aspects of their work; and he mill read reliable 
accounts which give insight into their activities. From these
-P-A-G-E-57
  CURRICULUM-MAKING 49 
sources he will discover the particular things that the 
farmers do in carrying on each piece of work; the specific 
knowledge which the farmers employ in planning and per- 
forming each specific task; the kinds of judgments at which 
they must arrive; the types of problems they must solve; 
the habits and skills demanded by the tasks; the attitudes 
of mind, appreciations, valuations, ambitions, and desires, 
which motivate and exercise general control. 
Facts upon all of these matters can be obtained from a 
survey of any agricultural region, however primitive or 
backward. But primitive agriculture is the thing which 
exists without any education. It is the thing education is 
to eliminate. The curriculum-discoverer, therefore, will not 
investigate just any agricultural situation. He will go to the L 
farms that are most productive and most successful from 
every legitimate point of view. These will often be’ experi- 
mental or demonstration farms which represent what is 
practicable for the community, but which may not be » ~~ 
typical of actual practices in that community. Where such 
general practices are inferior, agricultural education is to 
aim not at what is but at what ought to be. 
When the farming practices are already upon a high plane, 
education has but a single function: it is to hand over these 
practices unchanged to the members of the new generation. } 
Where the practices of a region are primitive or back- 4 
ward, education has a double function to perform. It is not 
only to hand over to the new generation a proficiency that 
is equal to that of their fathers, but it is also to lift the pro- 
ficiency of the sons to a height much beyond that of their 
fathers. Within such a region, therefore, agricultural edu- 
cation has the additional function of serving as the funda- 
mental social agency of agricultural progress. 
What we have said concerning agriculture is generally 
applicable throughout the occupational world. For discov-

ering the objectives for a training course in bricklaying one 
will analyze not the activities of bricklayers in general, but 
those where bricklaying has been carried to its highest 
practicable level of efficiency, — as this efficiency is judged 
on the basis of all legitimate standards. Education will aim, 
not at average bricklayers, but at the best types of brick- 
layers. 
When stated in broad outline, the general principle is 
obvious. In practical application, it presents difficulties. 
Men do not agree as to the characteristics of the most desir- 
able types of work. The employers of the bricklayers will 
be inclined to use maximum productiveness as the criterion 
of superior work; and unquestioning obedience to orders 
and contentment with any kind of hours, wages, and work- 
ing conditions as proper mental attitudes. The employees 
will judge otherwise as to some of the factors. The employ- 
ers will invite the curriculum-discoverer to investigate situa- 
tions where productiveness in proportion to costs is greatest; 
the employees, where the total welfare of the worker is con- 
sidered alongside of the factor of productiveness. Both sides 
‘ will agree that education should aim at the best and that 
scientific investigations as to objectives should seek to 
discover the characteristics of only the best. They disagree 
as to what is the best, and therefore where the investigations 
are to be made. 
The general principle of finding the scholastic curriculum 
in the shortcomings of children and men is quite obvious 
and entirely familiar to teachers in its application to the 
curriculum of spelling, grammar, and other subjects that 
result in objective performance, such as pronunciation, 
drawing, music, computation, etc. It is not so clearin con- 
nection with the highly complex subjects of history, litera- 
ture, geography, etc. What are the social shortcomings 
that are to be eliminated through a study of these social

subjects? Our ideas are yet so vague, in most cases, that 
we can scarcely be said to have objectives. The first task 
of the scientific curriculum-maker is the discovery of those 
v social deficiencies that result from a lack of historical, ‘liter- 
ary, and geographical experiences. Each deficiency found is 
a call for directed training; it points to an objective that is 
to be set up for the conscious training. The nature of the 
objectives will point to the curriculum materials to be se- 
lected for these subjects. A major obstacle is lack of agree- 
ment as to what constitutes social deficiency. There is how- 
ever no justification for scholastic training a any kind except 
as a gap exists between the training of general experience 
and the training that ought to be accomplished. 
Society agrees sufficiently well as to many social short- 
comings. Education needs to assemble them in as accurate 
and particularized a form as possible. “hey can then be 
used as the social symptoms which point to the objectives 
of history, literature, geograghy, economics, and other social 
studies. Society will disagree as to many suggested deficien- 
cies, A program can be scientific, however, without being 
completg. The thousand spelling words presented by Mr. 
Ayres is a good list notwithstanding the fact that it presents 
not more than a quarter of the words needed. It is a secure 
beginning that can be completed by further studies. In the 
same way in our social training, we shall do very well if we 
can set up a quarter of the desirable objectives. That would 
be a great advance over none at all, as at present; and would 
provide the nucleus, the technique, and the vision of possi- 
bilities, necessary for gradually rounding out the list. 
The principle involves us in similar difficulties in its appli- 
cation to civic, moral, vocational, sanitational, recreational, 
and ‘parental education. It is, equally valid, however, in 
connection with each of these (Only as we agree upon what 
ought to be in each of these difficult fields, can we know at

what the training should aim. Only as we list the errors and 
shortcomings of human performance in each of the fields 
can we know what to include and to emphasize in the 
directed curriculum of the schools. )

PURPOSES OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING 
Wir only occasional exceptions, each of the twenty 
million children now in the public schools of America will in 
time be obliged to earn his living. The schools should, 
therefore, deal with every normal child and youth on the 
theory that, when adulthood is reached, he must earn his 
living. Each is to be a producer to the extent that he con- 
sumes. 
In any survey of civilized conditions the most obvious 
thing is that men and women must work; that to their call- 
ings they must devote a major portion of their time and 
energy. They find Nature very parsimonious with her sup- 
plies of food, clothing, fuel, shelter; more illiberal still in 
supplying books, pianos, theaters, railroad and steamship 
tickets, church pews, and college courses. Nature supplies 
only the crudest raw materials. The rest must be created 
by human labor. 
Were man content with what Nature supplies, he would 
not be man, but only an exceptionally intelligent animal 
species. But he has not been content. He has manfully 
taken raw Nature in hand and through heavy labor con- 
trolled it and shaped it to his high human purposes. Thus 
he has laid the foundations of his civilization; won his 
measure of freedom from stern biological necessity; and 
thus alone can he hold his gains. Through productive toil 
he has won his leisure, his surplus energies, and the means 
for his art, his literature, sports, travel, science, religion. 
Occupational labors clearly represent the basic service to 
humanity, the most fundamental social service. In a day 
   
-P-A-G-E-64
    56 THE CURRICULUM 
when the watchword of the world’s humanitarian religion 
is “social service,” it is well to note that the most solid 
and never-relaxing portions of this service are the labors 
of farmer and merchant, plumber and carpenter, housewife 
and seamstress, miner and engineer, physician, teacher, and 
journalist, and the rest of the valiant army of men and 
women who labor. 
Those who object to vocational education in public schools 
because manual labor is sordid and unclean, should note 
that its frequent unloveliness is due, not to the fact that men 
work, but to the conditions of their labor. Insanitary shops, 
factories, and mines sap the physical vitality of the workers. 
Their inertia, ignorance, and inefficiency result in too long 
a work-day and a too-extended deadly mechanical monot- 
ony. They live usually within a narrow mental and social 
horizon. There is a great dearth of humanizing influences, 
companionships, and associations; and owing to this absence 
of uplifting influences and opportunities, they all too often 
tend to vicious and destructive animal pleasures. Too often 
they are compelled to live in crowded, unwholesome houses; 
are too often ill-fed, ill-clad, and uncleanly of habit; and 
have wagés that permit little better even if they should 
desire and attempt a higher standard of living. The frequent 
ugliness of labor conditions is sufficiently evident. 
The undesirable conditions are debasing, even destruc- 
tive. Their malign influence year after year does degrade or 
even destroy the laborer. After long exposure to them, his 
character cannot usually be of socially desirable type. Men 
should, however, clear the scales from their eyes, and see 
that while the maleficent influences may be the usual con- 
comitants of labor, they are not necessary concomitants. 
Each is really a foe to right labor; a demonstrable obstacle 
to efficiency. 
: { The purpose of occupational education is the removal through

  PURPOSES OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING 57 
general enlightenment of the injurious or destructive labor 
conditions. To admit that much of labor is debased and 
debasing is not an excuse for faltering before the task of voca- 
tional training. It is the very reason for manfully undertak- 
ing it. It is the presence of imperfections in the labor field 
that justify the ameliorative labors of education. As in the 
field of language, where there are no imperfections, there is 
no reason for.training in grammar. The more mistakes there 
are, the more the reasons for education. In the same way 
in the labor field, the greater the number of imperfections, 
the greater is the need of vigorous occupational education. 
In objection to the social-service doctrine of labor, it may 
be urged that vocations are and ought to be individualistic. 
It must be admitted, however, that there are some voca- 
tional classes upon whom does rest the moral obligations of 
social service. The physician, for example, supported by a 
given community is expected to serve that community to 
the best of his ability. He will respond to calls for service 
at any hour and under all conditions. Not his convenience, 
but theirs, is to be served. He must respond to the call of 
the poor who cannot pay with the same promptness and 
good-will that he extends to the call of the well-to-do. He 
must keep inviolate all information professionally confided 
to his care. In these matters the ethics of the medical voca- 
tion is clearly social. The work is recognized as social serv- 
ice. The physician’s measure of honor is the greater because 
it is so. 
Most professional service is of analogous type. And it is 
these social-service vocations that we regard as the highest. 
Men of the largest intelligence and ambitions regard them 
as the ones most desirable. To develop an ethics of social 
service about a calling does not deprive it of honor or desir- 
ability. On the contrary, it is thereby exalted. 
These professional labors are not the only ones about
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 THE CURRICULUM 
which public opinion is weaving systems of social ethics, 
We hear much nowadays of “public-service ” corporations. 
The phrase is one of recent coinage. Until within a few 
years corporations were expected to serve the stockholders 
and directors. Now we have faced them the other way. 
They are to serve the public. A railroad company, for 
example, can no longer fix the qualities, rates, or conditions 
of service in ways dictated solely by self-interest. These 
are fixed in the interests of efficient public service. Manu- 
facturers of foodstuffs and of clothing are no longer wholly 
free to follow the dictates of individual self-interest in the 
choice of the raw materials, the labeling of the product, the 
labor conditions under which produced, or, in extreme cases, 
even prices, when self-interest runs counter to community 
welfare. Where the two interests conflict, the public interest 
is coming to be dominant. The old plan was to “charge all 
that the traffic would bear.” In other words, there was to 
be a maximum of social extortion for a minimum of social 
service. The new situation reverses the terms. Its aim is a 
maximum of social service for a minimum of social expen- 
diture. 
This weaving of a social ethics about vocational groups 
proceeds with almost disconcerting rapidity. Many are 
finding it difficult to readjust their systems of ideas fast 
enough to keep pace with social changes. But the move- 
ment appears to be the irresistible movement of civilization. 
Many vocations, hitherto self-centered and materialistic, 
are being humanized, socialized, and lifted into a purer 
atmosphere. Bankers, manufacturers, and railroad officials, 
for example, in recognizing and absolving their recently dis- 
cerned social responsibilities, are taking places in social 
esteem formerly reserved only for the few so-called “learned” 
professions. 
Far less clear is this movement of the public conscious-
-P-A-G-E-67
  PURPOSES OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING 59 
ness as regards the work of the farmer, the small merchant, 
the housekeeper, the artisan, the factory-worker, and the 
unskilled laborer. It is easy to see that these classes serve 
the general welfare as fully and as fundamentally as the 
other elasses mentioned above; but their labors are not yet 
so fully recognized as community service. Their labors are 
looked upon as simply self-seeking modes of making a liv- 
ing. The difference in the social-service situation is not a 
difference of reality, but only one of social understanding 
and recognition. The farmer, for example, performs an 
indispensable community service in supplying the original 
elements of food and clothing. His service is not less high 
than that of the physician simply because he ministers to 
the bodily side of man. The physician also ministers to the 
bodily welfare; and in a less fundamental way. We can do 
without the labors of the physician most of the time; but 
the services of the farmer extend to every day of our lives. 
His labors are fully as strenuous, involve as long hours, and 
require as great disregard of physical discomforts. 
Recognition of the social-service position of the farmer, 
although inadequate as yet, is developing visibly and rap- 
idly. The general public is coming to see that many of its 
ills are due to inadequate service received at the hands of 
the men on the farms. The public is coming to scrutinize 
the service of the farmer, and to point out, through public 
opinion and legislation, ways in which he may better serve 
the general welfare; as in the handling of milk, the tuber- 
culin test of cattle, etc. Only a few regulations of this type 
have yet been extended to the farmer’s work. In general his 
social responsibilities are yet unrecognized. Whether the 
soil socially entrusted to his care shall bring forth twenty or 
one hundred bushels to the acre is altogether an affair of his 
own, and in no wise an affair of the rest of the men and 
women whom that land must feed. He is in the position of  
-P-A-G-E-68
60 THE CURRICULUM 
the street-car company that runs cars or not just as the 
company pleases without regard to the general welfare; or 
of the physician who responds or not to a call for help 
according to his own personal desires. The countless sug- 
gestions made nowadays by bankers, merchants, packing- 
house directors, grain-dealers, ultimate consumers, etc., to 
“educate ”’ the farmer so as to bring about better and bigger 
crops of all kinds, to keep him and his family healthy, happy, 
and efficient, and to keep the sons upon the farm, are indi- 
cations of a growing recognition of the indispensable social- 
service aspect of the farmer’s work. In spite of any desires 
on his part, a social ethics is being woven about the farmer’s 
work in the public consciousness. 
Responsibility is not all on one side, however. In serving 
all other groups efficiently, the farmer puts upon all of them 
the responsibility of serving his interests equally in return. 
He must have opportunities for himself and family for self- 
realization as full as those accorded to the groups which he 
serves. Current discussions of rural education, churches, 
social opportunities, rural surveys, etc., indicate a rapidly 
growing realization of these return social responsibilities. 
In developing this recognition of mutual obligation, the 
farmer loses nothing: he gains much. It means improved 
material conditions, a widened mental and social horizon, 
more numerous social contacts and opportunities, and 
heightened social esteem. His measure of honor and of 
reward must be in proportion to the general consciousness 
of his measure of service. 
It should be mentioned here that the development of a 
social ethics about any vocation is perhaps always done 
by those who receive the service, not by those who perform it. 
Food manufacturers are not the ones who pointed out the 
community-service aspect of their labors, and the result- 
ing obligations of purity, honesty of label, and full weight.
-P-A-G-E-69
  PURPOSES OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING 61 
Recognition of their obligations had to be forced upon them 
by those to whom they owed their responsibilities. This is 
equally true of railroads and municipal-service corporations, 
of journalists and Congressmen, of teachers and clergymen, 
judges and physicians. An occupational class does not of 
itself develop its own social ethics. This must be done by 
the general public, and perhaps always in the face of oppo- 
sition from the class that is being socially assimilated. The 
superintendent of schools in a large city recently stated that 
after fifty years of service within the city as teacher, princi~ 
pal, and superintendent, he had never known a progres- 
sive educational movement to be proposed that was not op- 
posed in the beginning by the majority of the teachers. If 
such is the case with an occupational group already so en- 
lightened as teachers, and already so imbued with the spirit 
and traditions of service, much more may initial oppositions 
be expected of social groups which are in less close contact 
with enlightenment, and which have not yet the social 
momentum of tradition. 
Social service does not mean self-renunciation. Self- 
interest cannot be eliminated. It is the steam that runs the 
whole machine. It has always been and must always be the 
mainspring of human action. It must be noted, however, 
that, on the one hand, there is a narrow, ignorant, materi- 
alistic self-interest; and on the other, an enlightened, hu- 
manistic self-interest characterized by wide social vision, 
which recognizes that individual welfare at its highest comes 
only through general community welfare at its highest. 
The growing zeal for the vocational education of all 
classes, shown by clear-sighted men and women whose 
primary interest is general human welfare, is closely related 
to this changed and still rapidly changing attitude toward 
all useful vocations. They see that every useful calling is 
not only in itself social service, but that it is coming to be so
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 THE CURRICULUM 
recognized; and that it is being more and more given its 
proper measure of social reward and honor. 
This is solving a problem hitherto insoluble, although our 
schools pretended to solve it by an impossible method. A 
certain few occupations, the professional and the mana- 
gerial, have been looked upon as possessing an ethical su- 
periority to commercial, mechanical, agricultural, or house- 
hold occupations. It has been felt that in the professions 
men can live honorable, worthy social lives, while in the other 
callings men are of necessity sordid-minded, self-seeking, and 
generally more or less debased. It has been felt that edu- 
cation must close the gates of full opportunity to no child. 
The only gates of full opportunity are those that open 
toward the professions. These are the ones, therefore, that 
are to be held open to every child — these and no others. 
To start him toward anything else is to deprive him irrevoca- 
bly and forever of the opportunity of full-statured, socially- 
honored manhood. The result has been that we have of- 
fered pre-professional training to all pupils. And we have 
refrained from recommending to students that they prepare 
for the so-called “lower” occupations. In this attitude 
teachers have been honest and high-minded. They have 
felt that only the best was good enough for their pupils. 
Their highest service, they have felt, has been to help their 
pupils to the highest. 
While honest and well-intentioned, the plan is incredibly 
shortsighted. The doors of opportunity are not opened to 
our twenty million children and youth in any such easy way. 
If all of them should take advantage of the opportunities 
and fit themselves to enter upon professional or managerial 
labors, they would find, when they reached the world of 
affairs, that there are positions of this type for less than 
ten per cent of them. More than ninety per cent would 
after fruitless preparation be compelled to enter the ranks
-P-A-G-E-71
  PURPOSES OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING 63 
of tradesmen, merchants, miners, farmers, factory opera- 
tives, etc. Nearly all would be turned back into the so- 
called “lower” vocations. Our people must be given credit 
for seeing the fallacy of the plan. The withdrawal of pupils 
of adolescent grades, of which we hear so much lament, 
appears to be indicative of a certain amount of common 
sense. Men see that the plan only pretends to offer high 
opportunity to all; it does not really do so. If every man and 
woman were a college graduate, the useful labors of the 
world would still have to be performed. Productive labor 
is not to be escaped by shunting everybody into the pro- 
fessions. ; 
So long as equally useful vocations have been so unequally 
honored and rewarded, and so long as labor conditions 
have offered such unequal opportunities for self-realization, 
this educational problem has been insoluble. The solution is 
coming, not through the impossible plan of lifting all 
people into the professions, but through lifting all vocations 
to the social level of the professions. The process is making 
the door to any useful vocation a door of opportunity. 
The objectives of occupational training 
In the imperfections of the occupational world, one finds 
the call for directed vocational training. 
If all occupational affairs were efficiently and harmoniously 
conducted by the present adult generation, education would 
have but a simple task to perform. It would be nothing 
more than to hand over to the members of the rising genera- 
tion the fully developed occupational heritage of the pres- 
ent generation. Educators would make a survey of actual 
occupational conditions by way of finding the particular 
objectives for which the young people are to be trained, 
It would be easy to discover demonstrable objectives ac- 
cepted by everybody, because they would be already actual 
in the world of affairs.

64 THE CURRICULUM 
Unfortunately, the present world of occupation is not of 
the type described. Affairs in general are managed neither 
| efficiently nor harmoniously. Asa matter of fact, the ad- 
vocates of most vocational training are often chiefly inter- 
| ested in raising the labors of agriculture, mechanical trades, 
| commerce, etc., to higher levels of efficiency. They are in- 
terested not so much in the education of youth as in the 
improvement of the work in the world of practical affairs, 
The improved education of the worker is simply a means of 
bringing about this result. 
Education under the circumstances has, therefore, a 
double task to perform: (1) to act as a primary agency of 
social progress, lifting the occupational world to a higher 
and more desirable level; (2) to do this by educating the 
rising generation so that they will perform their occupational 
functions in a manner greatly superior to that of their’ 
fathers. The task is to develop in the rising generation, not 
merely the degree of proficiency found in the world about 
them, but to carry them much beyond; to look, not merely. 
to the actual practices, but rather to those that ought to be. 
It is so to train them that the occupational mistakes, weak- 
nesses, imperfections, maladjustments, etc., that now appear 
so numerously in the occupational situations of their fathers 
shall be as fully as practicable eliminated in that more har- 
monious and more efficient occupational regime that they 
are to establish and maintain. 
Since the training is for the purpose of eliminating the 
various undesirable weaknesses, obviously one of the first 
tasks of education is to discover what these are. This at 
present is a baffling and in part an impossible task because 
of the vagueness of our knowledge as to what ought to be. 
Large portions of the occupational realm have not yet been 
sufficiently explored by scientific investigators. These un- 
explored regions constitute fields of great disagreement on  
-P-A-G-E-73
  PURPOSES OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING 65 
the part of differently situated interested parties. A list of 
occupational weaknesses drawn up by an employers’ asso- 
ciation will differ in essential particulars from one drawn 
up by a labor organization. A group of social or civic 
workers will prepare a list that will differ in important 
respects from either. 
Educators meet here with a grave difficulty. Thecorrection 
of grammatical or spelling errors, for example, has no impor- 
tant economic results. Property distributions are not af- 
fected. Men do not, therefore, greatly care what the list 
of grammatical or spelling weaknesses may be that are to 
be corrected by the training in our schools. They give little 
heed to our lists, however complete they may be. But in the 
occupational field, property is affected. An undesirable oc- 
cupational condition very frequently gives increased profits 
to one group and does harm to a second. It is, therefore, 
considered good and desirable by one and evil by the other. 
Each side develops a special economic theory. One justifies, 
the other condemns. Public education, however, must train 
the individuals of both groups for the occupational and eco- 
nomic things that ought to be. We cannot employ two sys- 
tems of thought in the drawing-up of the training; and each 
side forbids our using that of the other. And in the face 
of such a blocked situation, each side demands of the schools 
that something adequate be done. 
Apparently the only practicable thing for the present is 
to assemble that quite considerable list of occupational de- 
ficiencies upon which all sides can now agree sufficiently for 
getting a program under way. This can be only a partial 
program; but it can provide a common ground of under- 
standing which can be gradually extended until in time it 
embraces the whole field. 
A long list of occupational deficiencies can be obtained 
from the Report of the United States Commission on In-

dustrial Relations. This commission visited all portions of 
the country and secured testimony from representatives of 
eighty-two labor organizations; thirty-six employers’ asso- 
ciations; one hundred and thirteen firms and corporations; 
thirty-eight civil organizations; and fifty public institu- 
tions. Naturally witnesses of different types did not agree 
as to occupational maladjustments, or remedial measures. 
But education cannot wait till the world has settled all its 
differences. We must secure a list of deficiencies that can 
be agreed upon by at least a majority of citizens. In the 
following brief list we present a mingled sample of occu- 
pational deficiencies and maladjustments as reported to the 
commission by employers, employees, and social workers; 
or as implied in their testimony.?   Occupational deficiencies

. Inefficiency of managerial officials in organization, admin- 
istration, and direction of work. 
. Dearth of high ideals and standards of workmanship. 
. The misunderstanding and misvaluation on the part of each 
other of both labor and capital; the lack of mutual confidence; 
the class prejudices. 
_ 5. The failure of workmen to appreciate the superior power of 
intelligence over force in the correction of social and eco-

6. Inaccessibility of facts concerning the various occupational 
fields to many or most interested parties. 
%. Violence in labor troubles: lockouts, strikes, black lists, 
boycotts, use of provokers, spies, and gunmen, sabotage, 
“soldiering,” etc.

who are then thrown upon the scrap-heap because of the

‘When we examine reports of vocational surveys to see 
to what extent they have discovered the serious occupational 
difficulties that are to be met by better occupational edu- 
cation, we are disappointed in finding that many of them 
have discovered little beyond the technical inefficiency of 
the worker. The program of training which they recom- 
mend, therefore, is too often but. training for technical 
efficiency. This cannot be too much emphasized. But tech- 
nical inefficiency is but one of many shortcomings; and from 
an educational point of view, it presents the simpler prob- 
lems. Some of those on the wider social level are education; 
ally more baffling and will require more extended and elab- 
orate educational treatment. 
In such a list of occupational weaknesses we can dis- 
cover the objectives of occupational education. The pur- 
pose is so to train men and women that the weaknesses will 
not appear. Occupational education will seek to develop 
those abilities, dispositions, bodies of knowledge, types of 
skill, social attitudes and valuations, etc., the possession of 
which negative or prevent these and other technical and 
social deficiencies. 
More and more schools are recognized as the agencies of 
social progress. Where deficiencies are discovered in any 
aspect of social life, schools are being called upon to over- 
come and prevent. For example, let agricultural production 
fall short of needs and of what experiment stations show to 
be easily possible, and business men, Congressmen, and all 
others interested set up a great clamor for agricultural edu- 
cation, Millions of dollars are then voted and agricultural

courses introduced into land-grant colleges, high schools, 
continuation schools, extension systems, etc. There is pro- 
vision for long courses, short courses, and brief institute 
opportunities. County agents are appointed to lead and 
supervise. The practical men are very much convinced that 
education is the way to bring social progress. Let factory 
production be inefficient, and business men call in no un- 
certain tones for industrial education. Where commercial 
and clerical work is not well done, the call is for commercial 
and clerical education. When figures show the extent of 
physical defects, illness, and premature deaths, there is a 
demand for efficient health training in our schools. When 
our young men in large numbers are found to be physically 
unfit for military duty, there is widespread demand for 
military training in our high schools that will prevent our 
being caught unprepared. When traffic accidents grow com- 
mon on our crowded streets, the ery goes up for “Safety- 
First” training in our schools. When a generation appears 
that seems insufficiently to value money and tends to squan- 
der it, the call is for teaching “Thrift” in our schools. And 
so it goes. Practical business men are the first to call on the 
aid of the schools, and thus to recognize their fundamental 
position as agencies of social progress. 
As agencies of social progress, schools should give efficient 
service. And efficient service, we are nowadays coming to 
know, is service directed, not by guess or whim or special 
self-interest, but by science. To be efficient, schools are not 
to wait till somebody guesses that a certain type of social 
progress is desirable, or until it is prompted by desires of 
larger personal profits, or of avoidance of paying damages. 
Scientific management demands prevision — accurate pre- 
vision. It demands understanding that sees all factors in 
true and balanced relation without any distortion due to 
claims or oppositions of special interests. This means that
-P-A-G-E-78

scientific survey and analysis of human needs must be the 
method of discovering the objectives of the training that is 
demanded, not by individuals, but by the conditions of 
society. Such surveys will demand only what is practicable. 
But they will look to human conditions from no partial 
angle. In a democracy they will look impartially to all 
things that promote the total human welfare. They will be 
disproportionately interested in no special class, whether 
high or low, rich or poor, cultured or uncultured; but with- 
out prejudice or partiality will look equally to all.
-P-A-G-E-79
  CHAPTER VII 
SPECIALIZED TECHNICAL TRAINING 
Sprcrauizep technical training aims at a productiveness 
far beyond that of a pre-scientific generation. The efficient 
farmer, for example, in terms of proved standards, is one 
that raises, not one hundred bushels of potatoes to the acre, 
which is about the average, but rather two hundred to five 
hundred bushels. The efficient cotton-planter raises, not 
the average three eighths of a bale to the acre, but one full 
bale. The efficient bricklayer lays three hundred and fifty 
bricks per hour, instead of the usual one hundred and fifty. 
The efficient machinist in cutting steel turns out, not, as in 
the recent past, his ten units of product per day, but rather 
his forty, sixty, or one hundred units. 
This setting forward the standards of accomplishment is 
not chimerical. Scientific industry has proved its entire 
feasibility. It is to be done through the application of science 
to labor. It is the next step in the increase of productive- 
ness. Labor-saving machinery has been able to double, 
quadruple, or even at times to multiply the product a 
hundred-fold without increasing human labor. We are now 
being told that through the application of science to indus- 
try an equal further gain may be made. 
Each occupation is to be analyzed into the tasks that make 
it up; each task into the factors that require control. The 
science needed for the regulation of each factor is then to be 
assembled, and placed in secure control of every work- 
situation. The science is in control when it dominates the 
consciousness of the worker. He must think each factor in 
terms of the science of that factor. His planning consists of 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
aR a ce au RN ct ae a GE Ten STE es TE Sa oh SG: 
12 THE CURRICULUM 
putting his science-ideas to work. Thus he predetermines 
and foresees maximum results before a stroke of the work 
is done. 
Along with the primary matter of technical intelligence 
there is the secondary matter of operative skill. In some 
occupations, as, for example, stenography or telegraphy, 
the amount of practice needed for skill is large; and requires 
more time and effort than the technical information. But 
in general the large educational tasks relate to developing 
understanding rather than operative skill. 
The work of the farmer affords a good illustration. Rais- 
ing a crop of corn, for example, presents the problem of 
controlling a large number of independently variable fac- 
tors: soil ingredients, lime, nitrates, phosphates, sand, clay, 
moisture, soil oxygen, weeds, quality of seeds, temperature, 
light, plant parasites, and a number of others. For each 
factor in a given situation there is one optimum degree of 
strength; if its influence is either too weak or too strong, the 
crop is lessened. He must see each factor in its separate 
working in order to control it. Most of them are invisible 
or indistinguishable to the eye of sense; they are to be seen 
only by the inner eye of technical agricultural science. The 
trained farmer has this inner light and this inner vision. 
He can see and control the factors so as to secure his sixty 
or one hundred bushels per acre, while his unseeing rule-of- 
thumb neighbor secures only his twenty-five or forty 
bushels. The difference is not mainly due toa greater amount 
of. manual labor or of operative skill; but to the ability to 
see the conditions requiring control and a knowledge of the 
adjustments that are best under the conditions. 
After the trained farmer has examined all the factors that 
enter into a given situation, and has drawn up his plans, 
naturally he must have the operative skill for performing 
the processes: the ploughing, harrowing, cultivation, har-  
-P-A-G-E-81
  SPECIALIZED TECHNICAL TRAINING %3 
vesting, storing, etc. Some practice is required; but this 
presents no large problem. 
We have not been sufficiently accustomed to think of 
science as the source of maximum occupational productive- 
ness. We have, for example, ordinarily thought of efficiency 
on the part of a machinist or a plumber as mainly a matter 
of general intelligence and manual dexterity. There must 
be skill of eye and hand, as we have phrased it. There must 
be operative skill. We have given insufficient thought to 
the intellectual elements. 
Technical efficiency in a surgeon is very differently con- 
ceived. He, too, must possess great operative skill. Hand 
and eye must be as thoroughly trained as in the case of the 
mechanic — even more so. But back of the hand and guid- 
ing it, and back of the eye giving it vision, there must be 
fullness of technical knowledge. With the surgeon, skill of 
hand and eye is mainly a matter of intellectual discernment. 
The case of the surgeon exhibits the two factors of tech- 
nical efficiency in proper balance and relation. The mechanic, 
as popularly conceived, represents an incomplete stage in 
the development of technical efficiency. Trained to strength 
and dexterity on the operative side, and this alone, he has 
had but one side of the training he needs, and the less funda- 
mental side. He lacks the thought-materials in terms of 
which to think the factors of his work-situations. Without 
this he lacks power to see his work on anything but a rule- 
of-thumb level, or to know that there can be any other level. 
His great need also is a knowledge of technical science back 
of the hand for guiding it, and back of the eye for giving it 
vision. For the tradesman as well as the surgeon, effective 
operative performance must in the long run be mainly a 
matter of scientific discernment. 
In all parts of the occupational world to-day, rapid change 
is the rule. Workmen everywhere are being confronted
-P-A-G-E-82

1% THE CURRICULUM 
with new tasks and new conditions. In the presence of a new 
and strange work-situation, the technically untrained work- 
man does one of three things: (1) he blindly applies his rule- 
of-thumb procedure, trusting that it will work well enough. | 
Generally it is inefficient, and sometimes wholly unwork- — 
able. (2) He guesses at an adaptation that will meet the | 
| new conditions. Scientific studies have proved that there | 
are incalculably more ways of going wrong than right. 
He therefore usually guesses wrong; and the work is in- 
efficient, or a failure. (3) He is nonplussed by the situation. : 
He cannot make even a plausible guess. 
Not one of the three things that he can do is usually the 
right thing. And for him in his intellectual blindness there 
is no fourth possibility. He finds himself caught hopelessly 
unprepared. He can act only as directed by others; and 
usually only inefficiently. The condition of feudal servitude 
in which he works is the necessary result of his ignorance. 
And in his rewards he can reap only the fruits of ignorance 
and inefficiency. In his work he can never have any proper 
human opportunity; never possess the full-grown man’s 
independent outlook and ability. And what is more, out- 
side of his work, because of his inefficiency, he never can 
have any full human opportunity. In general, — and the 
conception is becoming more accurately defined each year, 
— one can have only in proportion as one earns. Unfitted 
to produce the means required for life upon a proper human- 
istic level, he never can attain it. His ignorance largely shuts 
him out both from work and from life. 
On the other hand, the technically trained individual is 
not perplexed by new occupational situations. He does not 
have to guess. He does not mechanically apply blind habit. 
And the reason is simple. The new situations that he meets 
are not new in the elements that compose them. He sees 
within them the same familiar factors, only differently bal-
-P-A-G-E-83
SPECIALIZED TECHNICAL TRAINING 1 
anced and arranged, with which he has been dealing all the 
time. He simply takes the measure of the factors in their 
new forms and goes on applying the same science. In his 
work he can feel himself a full-grown man; and with the 
fruits of his efficient labors, he can provide for himself and 
his family a full human opportunity. 
There is another closely related matter. The education 
which comes in youth must consider the technical intelli- 
gence needed for a lifetime. But a large proportion of the 
science needed in most fields is yet undiscovered. And natu- 
rally this portion of it cannot be now taught. But many of 
the things needed by those now entering upon their work 
will be discovered within a few years. If they are not to be 
left behind and cast upon the scrap-heap at an untimely 
age, they must keep abreast of discoveries and inventions 
relative to their specialty. For the technically untrained 
individual such progress is impossible. Lacking the main 
body of science, he has no apperceptive basis for appre- 
hending new developments, nor any vital interest in them. 
Inferior position or the scrap-heap is his inevitable portion. 
The technically trained individual is prepared to make the 
additions, the emendations, and otherwise to keep abreast 
of his science. He alone can value it. He will keep up with 
it as it appears in his technical journals; assimilate it with- 
out effort; and put it to practical use. While the schools 
cannot teach the undiscovered, yet they can provide the 
conditions that later will automatically take care of the 
matter. 
The technical training is here treated briefly because 
many of its aspects were presented in chapters mI-v. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
CHAPTER IX 
THE SPECIALIZED TRAINING OF GROUP-WORKERS 
Tue day of independent tradesmen and of other disasso- 
ciated workers is past or rapidly passing. In their places 
we have great factories, department stores, public-service 
corporations, railroad systems, school systems, hospitals, 
ecclesiastical organizations, building-construction com- 
panies, mining companies, etc. The productive capacity of 
specialized individuals in a codperative labor-group is much 
greater than that of the same individuals working independ- 
ently. They turn out a larger product, a better product, 
and at a reduced cost. Because of the greater efficiency it is 
probable that the movement will continue until it embraces 
most occupational fields. Education’s larger problem of 
technical training relates, therefore, not to the training of 
the independent specialist, but rather to the specialized 
training of associated workers. 
We can make the educational problem clear with an illus- 
tration or two. In the old days a shoemaker was master of 
his entire craft. He took the original order, prepared the 
leather, designed the shoe and each of its parts, cut each 
piece, did the sewing, the finishing, and finally the selling. 
For efficiency he had to have a command over all of the 
technical factors. At the present time, however, one man 
cuts out the sole; a second cuts the parts for the upper; a 
third, the lining; a fourth man sews the top to the vamp; a 
fifth sews on the toe-cap; a sixth gashes the insole prepara- 
tory to sewing it to the vamp; and so the process continues, 
the shoe passing down the line of several dozen workmen 
before it reaches the last one who places the finished shoes 
in the box ready for shipment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  SPECIALIZED TRAINING OF GROUP-WORKERS %% 
In this factory situation it is the manager who controls 
everything. Like the old-time shoemaker he has command 
of the technical information, makes all the necessary judg- 
. ments, and operates his man-and-steel machine in such a 
way as to perform all the processes. The one difference is 
that he uses a more elaborate set of tools and has devised a 
complicated machine that uses all of them at once. The men 
along the line are but fingers and wheels and levers in one 
large shoemaking machine. So far as their function is con- 
cerned, they are scarcely men at all. Had the manager all 
the inventions that he would like, he would have a machine 
into which he could feed the leather at one end, and out of 
which he could receive the finished product, ready boxed 
for shipment at the other, — about such an arrangement 
as wealready have in the production of our large newspapers, 
As a matter of fact, he has just that kind of a machine, 
though not yet perfected. The men scattered along the line 
are there temporarily to supply flexible fingers of flesh until 
cheaper and more skillful fingers of steel can be invented 
to fill the gaps, and the machine thereby completed, 
Lest it be thought that all tendency to mechanization of 
the workers is to be found only in the field of material pro- 
duction, let us note a case upon the professional level: that 
of teachers. One finds in a large city building a line of highly 
specialized teachers, each performing, as in the factory, a 
small portion of the total task. The first teacher in line 
receives the original raw material in the kindergarten and 
performs the first process. It is then taken by the I-B pri- 
mary teacher for a half-year. She passes it on to the I-A 
primary teacher, who gives to it her half-year of effort. 
And so the product in more and more finished form is passed 
down the long line of specialists. In the later years of de- 
partmental teaching, the tasks are more minutely specialized 
and the material passes through many hands. |
-P-A-G-E-86
iy ae ee ee ee oe 
8 THE CURRICULUM 
Now, here, as in the shoe factory, the things aimed at are 
the finished products, and the labors from beginning to end 
must all aim at the same products. But since each teacher 
performs but a fragment of the total process, the results of 
which usually do not greatly resemble the ultimate objec- 
tives, it follows that somebody whose vision is single for the 
final product and who sees all the steps to be taken must 
think for the whole organization and direct the steps. Super- 
intendent and principal, therefore, lay out the courses of 
study, choose the books, supplies, and equipment, and direct 
the methods. The supervisory brain, so to speak, does the 
thinking for the whole organization; the teachers are but 
hands and voices to this brain. 
This feudal theory tends at present to be strong wherever 
organization develops — whether in factory or school, rail- 
road or hospital, department store or ecclesiastical organ- 
ization. It appears to demand specialized technical training 
for the five or ten per cent who lead and think and plan; 
but for the vast majority only such little training as they 
need for skill in routine labor. The less they trouble their 
superiors by thinking and insisting upon being heard, the 
better for all. 
This feudal theory is being supplanted rather rapidly by 
a democratic theory. Let us resume our two illustrations 
by way of explaining its basic conceptions. Instead of its 
being the manager of the shoe factory who takes the place of 
the original independent tradesmen, it is the total group who 
takes his place. In the school field, it is not the superintend- 
ent or principal who takes the place of the general teacher 
of a century ago, but it is the total group. It is not the mana- 
ger, the superintendent, or other head of an organization 
who is to do the thinking that goes into the work; it is rather 
the ertire associated group. Managers and superintendents 
are those who have specialized in leadership. They are gen<

eralists; while the individual workers are specialists. Where 
all are made intelligent as to the group-labors, the sum of 
the knowledge of the specialists added to that of the gener- 
alists is greater than that of the generalists alone; and this 
aggregate is a more effective directive agency. And as work- 
ers are changed from industrial serfs to freemen with minds 
and rights to think and with responsibility resting upon them 
for thought and suggestions, they are filled with a new 
spirit. Recognized as men, they become men; act like men; 
and the curve of their operative efficiency mounts rapidly 
upward. 
The accompanying diagram will show the relations within 
the school organization; and is typical of right relations in

all organizations. Over all the group, specialists as well as 
generalists, is the science that should control in taking every 
step. Both must read it. But it isnot tobe read in books

  80 THE CURRICULUM 
of abstractions; however valuable they may be as helps. It 
is to be read within the practical situations where they work; 
and by those in contact with the actualities in their details. 
Some things can be seen most clearly by the generalist; 
other things most clearly by the specialist. As indicated 
by the width of the bars, the generalist will see everything 
equally in balanced relation, his function being interpreter 
and cotrdinator for the whole. But every part of the work 
is vitally related to every other part. The specialist cannot 
see his duties if he looks to them alone without regarding the 
labors of the whole organization. He can rightly see any 
task only as he sees it as a part of the whole organization- 
task. As shown by the width of the bars, he will have a fuller 
understanding than the principal in his special field; but he 
must also have an understanding of the whole field that is 
much like that of the principal, except as to its complete- 
ness. Each teacher is, so far as possible, to be his own co- 
ordinator. Otherwise there can be no efficiency in organi- 
zation labors. The principal cannot be always at the elbow 
of every teacher dictating every codrdinating adjustment. 
It is educational science that must preside at every teacher’s 
desk and do the dictating. The teacher is, therefore, to be 
a specialist in one thing and a generalist in all. Having oper- 
ative skill in one thing, he needs nothing more than the gen- 
eralist’s skill in the others. He needs éo think all, but not to 
do all. For his thinking he needs to be trained in the work of 
the entire organization; for operative skill, he needs to be 
drilled and practiced only in the special tasks required of him. 
An orchestra provides us with a perfect illustration. The 
conductor is a generalist; but every individual player must 
also be a generalist, or he cannot be a perfect specialist. He 
must think the whole piece, his consciousness must move as 
the full current of the total music, in order rightly to place 
his special part. The kettle-drummer, for example, must
-P-A-G-E-89
  SPECIALIZED TRAINING OF GROUP-WORKERS 81 
strike at exactly the right instant, with the right degree of 
loudness, and with his instrument properly attuned. Con- 
ductor and music-score are necessary helps to his thinking; 
but they alone cannot determine any one of the three 
enumerated elements with exactness. He needs to be trained 
on the conscious side to the whole of the music rightly to play 
his part. But on the operative side he may be skillful with 
but the one instrument. 
The two illustrations are taken from fields where it is 
admitted that the specialized workers must be generalists 
in thought in order efficiently to codrdinate their speci- 
alties. Not so obvious is the need in the case of factory, rail- 
road, or large department store. Recently, however, in all 
these types of organization, schools are being voluntarily 
established in which specialists are not only trained for 
their specialties, but also to an understanding of the whole 
in order rightly to understand each specialty. This move- 
ment shows promise of abundant growth. Industrial and 
commercial organizations are becoming conscious of the 
interdependencies of all the parts, and of the subtle and in- 
finitely numerous ways in which inefficiency or maladapta- 
tion in one portion affects all the rest. They are realizing the 
consequent need on the part of each to see and continually 
to think the whole in order rightly to think one’s own part. 
As the science is developed in terms of which to do all the 
necessary thinking, what is now obvious in the case of the 
school or the orchestra will become equally obvious in the 
case of all group-labors. 
Enough has been said to indicate the curriculum solu- 
tion. On the thought side, workers are to be taught as 
though they were to work in all parts of the organization. 
This will mean not only full intellectual studies relating to 
all aspects of the work, and systematic observation of all; 
but also some opportunity to work in all portions of the field,
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 THE CURRICULUM 
To work means to bear participative responsibility of some 
kind, which will differ according to the nature of the work. 
Sometimes he will work at a thing quickly learned on the 
operative side, or one requiring no special operative skill; 
in such case he may well bear full responsibility. In other 
cases, involving specialized skill which requires long prep- 
aration, he may serve as a helper to the skilled operative so 
as to bear enough responsibility for acquiring the generalist’s 
necessary insight and appreciation. 
So far as public education takes care of this training, it 
may leave the individual on the semi-specialized level, — a 
generalist within some broad occupational field. Carried 
thus far his training is practically complete. Usually the 
final specialization will be left until the individual is em- 
ployed in the occupation itself. Understanding the whole, 
he will quickly master his specialty. But it cannot usually 
take place in any school. It usually must take place in the 
occupational situation where he is to work, as directed by 
technical specialists employed for the purpose. 
Occupational education must concern itself largely with 
the preparation of workmen and managers for right mental 
attitudes toward the work. The general technical intelligence 
referred to must constitute much of the basis for these right 
mental attitudes. The manager as a generalist among 
trained specialists actually does but a small portion of the 
total group-task. But seeing the whole and thinking the 
whole, as he does his small part, he feels himself doing the 
whole. Just so it is with the fully enlightened specialized 
worker. Let him as he works at his minute task have a clear 
intellectual vision of the total group-task. With his discern- 
ment of interdependencies, and of the way his labor is con- 
cerned in and supports all the rest, he too feels his power and 
his responsibility to extend outwards to the farthest limits 
of the group-labors. In his consciousness, the specialist may
-P-A-G-E-91
“ieee ee gs es ee 
SPECIALIZED TRAINING OF GROUP-WORKERS 83 | 
feel himself a master about as fully as the generalist. The main 
difference between the laggard specialist as a slave and the 
vigorous specialist as a master is in having or not having the 
intellectual vision of the work as a whole. The one feels his 
personality and his responsibility to be as small as his petty 
task. To the other, both are greatly magnified since his 
vision of the group-labors becomes his vision of his own 
labors. 
At Beverly, Massachusetts, in their part-time shop school, 
where they are training machinists for the United Shoe 
Machinery Company, they have equipped a small shop with 
all the kinds of machines used in the large factory. As the 
boys are trained, they pass from machine to machine so as 
to become proficient in the entire range of labor to be found 
within the large factory. In both school and factory, they 
are bringing each of the workmen to a full understanding of 
all of the labors performed in the shop. This same width of 
industrial training is attempted in all well-developed in- 
dustrial schools. Apprenticeship contracts usually specify 
that the boy shall be moved about from one kind of work to 
another so as to have an opportunity to master all of the 
processes. 
Under the so-called “Taylor System ”’ of scientific manage- 
ment, all the thinking is done by specialized officials in the 
“planning-room.” Decisions are there made as to what is to 
be done every hour during the day by every man in the 
shop. Instructions are typewritten, and sent out to the 
workmen. The latter are not expected to do any thinking or 
judging or deciding; this is all done for them; they are only 
to obey orders. 
This system is looked upon by many factory managers 
as the most perfect that has yet been devised. It puts science 
in the saddle. Yet the system is not popular. Where it is 
tried, it is frequently abandoned. It usually breaks down,  
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 THE CURRICULUM 
we are told, because most labors are so complicated that 
the planning-room cannot foresee all contingencies; and 
therefore cannot make provision for all necessary codrdina- 
tions. It takes responsibility for thought and initiative off 
the men. When instructions are deficient or obscure, work 
has to stop until further orders are received. Where instruc- 
tions to different workmen are contradictory, the plan gives 
them no power to adjust matters. The relative failure of the 
Taylor System seems to result from insufficient attempt to 
enlist the intelligence and initiative of the men. The system 
claims that both managers and men are working under the 
control of science; yet, as a matter of fact, this science is 
mostly visible only to the management; and is little or not 
at all visible to the men. They see only the orders. The sys- 
tem represents a halfway step, however, toward actual and 
inevitable scientific management. Science rules in the 
planning-room; it must also rule in the consciousnesses of 
the workmen. 
The human element 
Recently there has been an awakening on the part of 
leaders of organized industry as to the far-reaching signifi- 
cance of the human element. The independent tradesman 
did not have to manage men; he had no such problem. It 
has arisen with organization, where men work in groups, 
and where the generalist must be in part the director — 
at least the leader — of the specialists; where he must play 
upon them and through them as does the conductor of an 
orchestra. 
Of large occupational organizations, it is education that 
has most fully recognized the need of taking into account 
the human element. In a school system, for example, the 
pupils are the ultimate workers. Using the terminology of 
the factory, the teachers rank as foremen. It is their busi-

ness not to do the work that educates, but to get it done by 
the pupils. In doing this, they must know the pupils: know 
their varying mental capacities, their interests, their apti- 
tudes and abilities, their states of health, and their social 
milieu. ‘They must know how to arouse interest; how to 
motivate them from within; how to adjust the conditions 
of the work to child-nature; how to keep up an abundant 
physical vitality in the children; and how to employ com- 
munity influences for vital stimulation of the pupils. 
Now come the leaders of scientific management in industry 
and commerce and proclaim their recognition of the human 
factor as a great and revolutionizing discovery. ‘ Superin- 
tendents and foremen in factories must know their men, 
their psychology, aptitudes, interests, motivating influ- 
ences, etc., so as to be able to stimulate them to the greatest 
desirable degree of productivity. It has been found that 
arbitrary driving will not work with men any more than 
with pupils. The driving force must lie within the will of the 
worker. The foreman must adjust conditions of work, wages, 
factory sanitation and comforts, opportunities of promo- 
tion, of social recognition, etc., so that this inner driving 
force will awaken naturally and of itself within the worker. 
The foreman must be able to read the nature and needs of his 
men as fully as the teacher reads his pupils. He needs to be 
proficient in practical psychology, practical sociology, 
industrial hygiene and sanitation, and other human studies 
that are at the same time technical studies for him. 
In the relations of foremen, managers, etc., to their men, 
the greatest single source of codrdination is a large ground of 
common understanding, community of thought, and mutual 
confidence in the motives actuating both sides. Where all 
are informed as to the controlling science, where all have 
access to all the facts relative to the economic and other vital 
affairs of the group, in ways otherwhere specified, these
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 THE CURRICULUM 
grounds of mutual confidence and understanding are se- 
curely laid. In the bitter antagonisms of labor and capital, 
the need is being voiced by both sides. One of our well- 
known captains of industry is reported recently to have said: 
If capital and labor do not get together in the right spirit, the 
future of America is doomed. If they do not come to see that the 
interests of each are inseparably bound up with the interests of 
the other, and that each must be mutually recognized and re- 
spected, then capital’s resources are doomed, just as the workers’ 
prosperity is doomed. 
One cannot exist without the codperation of the other. To drive 
this stupendous fact home to each of these two forces, to make 
each know that it is but the complementary force of the other, and 
not an antagonistic force, is the most vital problem before the 
United States to-day. 
Let the officers of this company understand that there is never 
to be another strike in our company, that every man is to be 
treated as a partner and not as an enemy or an underling. .. . 
Now, to be partners, to codperate intelligently and effec- 
tively, to be able mutually to recognize and respect the inter- 
dependent interests of the other, etc., — these things imply 
that all must have access to the same body of facts; and that 
all have the trained powers of mind necessary for rightly 
interpreting and judging of those facts. As yet, taking the 
industrial world in general, neither of these things has been 
provided for. And so long as this is the case, industrial 
antagonisms, occasionally flaring forth into actual warfare, 
will and must continue. But just as the industrial leaders 
are now calling on the schools for remedying technical 
weaknesses on the side of labor processes, so they must like- 
wise depend upon the schools to provide much of the train- 
ing needed for those other weaknesses on the side of the 
human factor. Neither side is now consciously trained for 
mutual understanding. Both sides are equally in need of ex- 
tended training, that has community of thought, and outlook, 
and valuations, as its conscious purpose.

  CHAPTER X 
SOCIAL ASPECTS OF OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 
One hears much nowadays concerning “occupational 
efficiency.” But the term may refer to either of two widely 
different conceptions. One may take the short and narrow 
view, and conceive the term as meaning only “high material 
productiveness.”” The degree of efficiency in such case is to 
be measured by the amount of economic product. Beyond 
this, it does not go. It leaves the product in the hands of 
the producer without further inquiry. 
On the other hand, the term may refer to “high efficiency 
in the promotion of the general human welfare.” The degree 
of efficiency is to be measured by the quantity of human 
service. Whereas the narrow view looks at the material 
product as the finished product, this humanistic view sees 
the finished product only within those human results that 
arise from the use of the economic product. The latter is a 
means; not an end. Not unnaturally this is the view that is 
coming to be preferred by the world at large. Even though 
labor because of great technical knowledge and skill may 
turn out a large product, if that product falls into only a 
few hands where it is selfishly misused so as to produce or 
to permit continuing human ill-fare instead of welfare, then 
the occupation cannot be looked upon as efficient in any 
desirable way. In terms of human service, it is inefficient. 
Efficient management of the social factors is as vital as 
technical efficiency. The economic mechanism is to be 
operated by society in general for the sake of maximum 
human service. This task is immeasurably more compli- 
cated than operating a lathe or a locomotive or raising a crop 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  88 THE CURRICULUM 
of corn. If technical training is needed for the latter, cer- 
tainly then technical training of all people for the effective 
operation of our vast economic mechanism is much more 
needed. 
Division of labor has created the problem. To see this, 
let one first think of our country civilized as at present and 
producing as much as possible of the things used to-day — 
but without any division of labor. Within such a situation 
vocational education would be highly desirable. But it 
would be only for technical information and skill. There 
would be no need for training in the social aspects of occu- 
pation because there would be no social aspects. Production 
would be wholly individualistic; and distribution non- 
existent. Each worker would receive in proportion as he 
produced — neither more nor less. Each would have in pro- 
portion as he earned. There would be no economic mechan- 
ism to be operated by society; and consequently no need of 
community training in the technique of operation. 
But specialization of labor has introduced social inter- 
dependency. Each produces one thing; and this not for 
himself alone, but for all the group. In return each receives 
from the others that portion of their product which they 
have produced for him. The obverse side of division of labor 
is the organic interdependence of the group. The individu- 
alistic situation disappears in proportion as specialization 
appears. In the degree in which the group is divided for the 
performance of specialized labors, it must be united for any 
effective codperative distribution of the fruits of those labors. 
Without the latter, the purpose of the divided labor is 
defeated. 
This coUperation of specialists demands general under- 
standing on the part of all as to the common ends; of the 
means of attaining them; and a disposition to obey the | 
social dictates. It seems that each member of society needs
-P-A-G-E-97
  OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 89 
to be informed as to the total occupational situation: the 
working conditions that are supplied to all classes of special- 
ized workers; the relation of these to right standards; the 
productivity of the various occupations; the distribution of 
the products; the nature and mode of operation of the eco- 
nomic mechanism necessary for accomplishing all of the 
social purposes. And along with information, he also needs 
social attitudes and valuations. The social studies of our 
schools, the history, geography, literature, economics, etc., 
have the large and inadequately recognized task of develop- 
ing both information and attitudes. The ends demand a 
program of large proportions that has been mostly unrecog- 
nized and unattempted. 
The conception that the labors of an industry are to be 
supervised by those who are served is really as old as indus- 
try itself. It was formerly done by the consumer’s accept- 
ance or rejection of the product. If it did not suit him, he 
went elsewhere. This plan is operative still. But industries 
have grown large and complex. Competition is eliminated 
through price agreements, or division of the field. Often 
one cannot now go elsewhere for supplying his needs. Proc- 
esses and products have grown so complicated that he can 
no longer judge of quality of commodities or justice of 
prices. He cannot know whether he ought to go elsewhere 
or not. Should he do so, being unable to distinguish the 
better from the worse, he still cannot know whether he is 
improving matters. Men are coming to see that a kind of 
intelligence and a mode of supervision of the services of 
others that worked well in a simpler economic age can no 
longer serve our purposes. New conditions demand new 
methods. 
Public-service labors are coming to be supervised by the 
public through public-service commissioners, committees 
of city councils, the United States Interstate Commerce
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 THE CURRICULUM 
Commission, etc. These representatives of the public keep 
a continuous oversight over quality, quantity, costs of serv- 
ice, etc. Year by year this community supervision is aug- 
mented and strengthened; and freedom to serve or not as 
dictated by self-interest is diminished. Each year sees the 
extension of this supervision to hitherto unsupervised occu- 
pational fields. For some time it has been accepted as a 
matter of course, in the case of railroads, express companies, 
telegraph and telephone companies, city traction, gas, and 
electrical supply companies, the work of plumbers as regards 
sanitation, of carpenters and electricians as regards fire 
protection, etc. More recently the supervision is being 
extended to food and drug manufacture and distribution, 
the milk-supply, packing-house industries, the handling of 
perishable foods, etc. 
But all useful specialized labors are public-service labors. 
It becomes ever more difficult to draw any line of division 
between industries that are to be socially supervised and 
those that are to be left only to the control of individual 
self-interest. The logical end of the process is the extension 
of social supervision to all that serve and the suppression 
of all that do not serve. And all social movements set 
strongly in that direction. Where done wisely and justly, 
its influence is salutary both to industry and general com- 
munity. 
Whether the supervision does good or harm to the occu- 
pations, and thus to the community itself, depends upon the 
quantity of sympathetic occupational enlightenment em- 
ployed by the public in the supervision. Where present in 
sufficient degree, a community can maintain a high charac- 
ter of service while keeping costs on a level that is just to all 
concerned. On the other hand, ignorant or mercenary super- 
vision can diminish or destroy the power of an industry for 
service, and thus do harm both to industry and community.
-P-A-G-E-99
  OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 91 
To require of a railroad, for example, a high character of 
service, but at the same time to keep the rates so low that 
necessary expenses cannot be met, may injure or destroy 
the service that the supervision is intended to improve. 
The supervision at bottom must be performed by the men 
and women of the general community. They may delegate 
legislative and executive action so far as these are required. 
But they must first know what they want their representa- 
tives to accomplish before they can delegate the responsibili- 
ties; or check up the work to see that the right things are 
done. There must be informed public opinion and right 
community attitudes and valuations. While this community 
mind may partly control through governmental mechanism, 
in the main it doubtless must act directly in influencing the 
acts of its specialized members. When all members of an 
industry know what is expected of it, and when they know 
that the public knows, and that the public will be instantly 
aware of any missteps that they may make, — this is the 
situation that crystallizes into “social conscience.” It is 
this that will supervise and exercise social control. One can 
appreciate the relations by noting the analogous “grammar 
conscience.” It is not necessary to employ legal machinery 
for enforcing the laws of grammar. To know what is right 
usage, and to know that one’s associates will instantly 
detect and silently condemn any deviations therefrom, is 
enough to hold the well-informed individual pretty close 
to the straight and narrow paths of grammar. In the same 
way it is public knowledge of an occupation that through 
public opinion must directly and indirectly supervise that 
occupation. And education must confer the necessary en- 
lightenment, social attitudes, and occupational conscience. 
The acceptance-rejection method of supervision of early 
days was of a democratic type. Everybody knew products, 
processes, and social relationships sufficiently to supervise;
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 THE CURRICULUM 
and on the basis of this knowledge, through accepting or 
rejecting the products everybody was continually engaged 
in the task of supervision. Each did it for himself, however. 
Special training was not needed. Codperative and system- 
atic methods of diffusing the necessary intelligence were 
not needed. In one fundamental aspect that was a day of 
industrial democracy. Except as labor was purely individual, 
each served all, and all supervised each. The present is 
asking nothing more. It is asking only for new methods 
that can be as effective for present-day conditions as the 
older methods were for the old days. One of the major 
differences must be in the mode of diffusing the necessary 
enlightenment. As much as in the old days, all need now to 
understand products, processes, and occupational relation- 
ships. But the knowledge cannot be picked up incidentally. 
What could formerly be well enough done without the help 
of the schools can no longer be accomplished in any such 
unsystematic and incidental way. A school task always 
arises when the incidental method breaks down in the face 
of complicated conditions. The economic revolution of the 
past few decades has in this manner created an educational 
task of gigantic proportions. 
One has but to examine the newer courses of study and 
textbooks to note the growing realization of this task. 
Industrial Studies of the United States, Commercial Geography, 
Industrial History, Makers of Many Things, Wheat-Growing 
in Canada, United States, and the Argentine, How the World 
is Fed, Clothed, and Housed, Diggers in the Earth, The Farmer 
and his Friends, The Book of Wheat, Book of Cotton, Book of 
Corn, The Story of Sugar, Story of Oil, Leather Manufacture, 
—such occupational books are rapidly finding place in 
schools everywhere. The movement indicates a realization 
of the need of enlightenment as the basis of occupational 
adjustment in a democracy.

Geography divides the world up into a few grand divi- 
sions; these grand divisions into several score countries and 
states; and then presents the situation in each country one 
after the other. In the same way, in acquiring an under- 
standing of the world of occupations, we may well divide 
it into nine grand divisions; divide the latter into several 
score occupational fields; and then present studies of the 
important ones. As in the geography, it is possible to group 
related divisions, and study many cognate occupations at 
one time. Much can be done on the basis of type-studies, 
where a single occupation studied intensively can be used 
to reveal the situation in several similar fields. It is also 
possible to view and study the whole occupational realm at 
once by considering single aspects one after the other; as 
for example, wages, hours of labor, seasonal fluctuations, 
profits, desirability of different vocations from a hygienic 
point of view, social desirability of different occupations, 
etc. When these methods of attacking the problem are 
   
-P-A-G-E-102

  THE CURRICULUM 
considered, it is not so formidable as may at first sight 
appear. 
What are the things that people need to know for super- 
vision of occupational groups? Let us here mention seven 
things: — 
1. 
2. They need definite knowledge of the human needs that 
are to be ministered to by the different occupations. 
They must know definitely the character of occupa- 
tional service required for meeting the needs fully and 
without waste. 
. They must know the extent to which any occupational 
group is actually delivering the required character of 
service. 
. They must know what material and other facilities are 
needed by each occupation for performing service of 
the kind required. 
. They need to know the extent to which the community 
is actually providing the needed facilities. 
. They need a knowledge of technical processes only suf- 
ficient for understanding the findings of inspectorial 
experts concerning the efficiency, economy, and general 
social effectiveness of occupational services. 
. They need full appreciation and understanding of 
the dependence of group upon group. It is this vision 
of interdependence, of common membership within 
a common group, which creates those sympathetic 
attitudes necessary for considerateness in the super- 
vision. 
Naturally it is not meant that memories shall be stored 
with great masses of recallable facts relative to all of these 
things; or that the educational task is any such memoriza- 
tion. Man has no such memory-capacity. And more seri- 
ous educational malpractice can scarcely be imagined. 
The things which the public needs to know about each  
-P-A-G-E-103
OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 95 
occupation has a counterpart in the things that the spe- 
cialized workers need to know for willing and intelligent ac- 
quiescence in the supervision. This represents a vital por- 
tion of specialized vocational training, treatment of which 
was deferred because of its intimate relation to the super- 
visory problem. 
The specialized workers need a more detailed knowledge 
than society in general concerning their own occupation 
along the seven following lines: — 
UB 
2. 
38. 
7 Full knowledge of the human needs which their occu- 
pation is to serve. 
Specialized knowledge of the character of service which 
they are to render. 
The extent to which they are actually rendering such 
service. 
. Accurate knowledge of what they must demand from 
the general public in order that they may have the 
facilities needed for effective service. 
. Accurate knowledge of the extent to which they are 
being supplied with the needed facilities. 
. Such full knowledge of technical processes and of 
results secured by their group that they can adjudge 
the justice of the findings of community inspectorial 
experts; and accept them when just, and correct them 
when unjust. 
Full and specialized understanding of the dependence 
of their group upon the social whole; and of the total 
community upon their group. This consciousness of 
sharing a common lot, and of requiring reciprocal sup- 
port, lies at the root of willing submission to the gen- 
eral mandates and of willing service on the part of those 
supervised. It is this which shows the specialized work- 
ers that the road of self-interest and the road of service 
are one and the same.
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 THE CURRICULUM 
When both general public and occupational specialists 
have these types of information, the intelligence-basis will 
be laid for effective social control in this difficult field. Each 
side has rights; and each has duties. The knowledge re- 
ferred to permits a clear definition of both rights and duties 
by all interested parties. It also lays a broad foundation 
of common understanding upon which all can meet in the 
current adjustment of conflicting claims. For it must be kept 
in mind, as we shall hereafter discuss, that the push and pull 
of specialized groups, in which each tends to exaggerate 
its services and its rights, are inevitable. Social tensions and 
strains, requiring constant and ever-renewed adjustment, 
are inherent in the nature of the life-process, whether phy- 
siological, biological, or social. Intelligence cannot obliter- 
ate them but it can control. The stronger they are, the 
greater is the indication of life and of power. But also the 
greater is the need of social education. 
Enlightenment alone can bring genuine industrial democ- 
racy. An examination of the factors shows the futility of 
much of the controversy as to the best type of economic 
mechanism. We have public ownership and codperative 
management in some of our occupational fields, such as pub- 
lic education, letter and parcel transportation, fire pro- 
tection, street and road construction and maintenance, etc. 
We leave to private ownership and volunteer management 
most of our industries, believing that on the whole this is 
best. But as a matter of fact whether the labors are of one 
type or of the other, the thing needed and wanted is service. 
The kinds of enlightenment needed for social supervision of 
both types are exactly the same. Where society is intro- 
ducing and developing effective supervision, the methods 
are scarcely affected by the question whether the indus- 
try is publicly or privately owned, — i.e., whether by a few 
stockholders, or by the many stockholders of a total com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  
OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 97 
munity. Either plan is good or bad according to the way it 
is managed. With enlightened social supervision, effective 
service can be secured under either plan. But without en- 
lightened supervision, effective service can result from 
neither. Not the mechanism, but the intelligence, is the prin- 
cipal thing. 
Before education can proceed, it must have the facts con- 
cerning the various occupations. At present many of the 
necessary facts are inaccessible. Secrecy in the interest of 
individual ends rather than publicity in the interest of 
the public weal is the rule, not the exception. As a nation 
we have not yet come to value enlightenment as the basis 
of democracy. But the light is nowadays being turned into 
all sorts of places. Occupational surveys are being made. 
Official public-service bodies are accumulating facts for 
their purposes, to many of which publicity is being per- 
mitted. In proportion as an industry is performing actual 
public service, it is always glad to have it known; and since 
the quantity increases year by year, the quantity of volun- 
tary publicity increases also. When an industrial group is 
particularly anxious to prevent publicity, more and more 
the public is coming to suspect that there is exactly where 
publicity is needed. 
Enlightened business men are coming to understand the 
publicity implications of social interdependence. The salu- 
tary attitude of the business world was recently well ex- 
pressed by Mr. E. H. Gary, chairman of the United States 
Steel Corporation, in an address before a business conven- 
tion, for which he took as a theme the Biblical quotation: 
“For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to 
himself.”” Among other things he said: “In the last decade 
there has been a pronounced change in the attitude of large 
business interests concerning the disclosure of facts and 
figures to the general public. Many now voluntarily and 
 
-P-A-G-E-106

without the requirement of law make regular and complete 
reports so that any one interested may know the results 
of the business and the general policy of the company.” Mr. 
Gary suggested a publicity tribunal which would serve the 
interests both of the business world and of the general pub- 
lic. “There is abundant evidence,” he continued, “that at 
present the great general public is willing to meet halfway 
the individual or corporation in the consideration of all 
| questions that affect private or public interests.” The move- 
| ment is unmistakable. Facts are becoming accessible. The 
use of such facts for the development of general_enlighten- 
| ment is becoming possible. 
Surveys may discover the facts. But the organization of 
the materials for teaching purposes presents educational 
problems of great complexity. The direct fact-learning and 
recitation method, with which our profession is so familiar, 
is too primitive and inefficient for so large a task. Let us 
indicate some of the better ways that are being introduced 
into progressive school systems. 
Each occupation is to be seen and vitally understood as 
a group of men at work. One learns the labors of a group by 
entering into their labors; by performing them actually; 
by performing them in play; by entering into them sympa- 
thetically through observation; by imaginative participa- 
tion as they are reconstructed in well-written history, geog- 
raphy, literature, biography, etc. It is not by learning 
abstract verbal facts about a group, but rather by doing 
in one way or another what that group does that one comes 
really to understand it. The doing lays the interest-basis 
necessary for fact-accumulation and assimilation; and for 
right valuations and attitudes. Education must proceed 
by the active route not because we are aiming at fewer facts 
than formerly but because we must aim at far more; and 
must therefore employ effective methods.

1. Concrete occupational activities 
Professor James, in his delightful essay, On a Certain 
Blindness in Human Beings, makes clear that one can un- 
derstand and realize the experiences that make up the lives 
of others only as one has participated actually or sympa- 
thetically in those experiences. The detached and unmoved 
onlooker remains blind to the actual significance of life 
about him. Life must be lived in order to be known. “The 
right way of seeing each other’s work” requires that we en- 
ter sympathetically and vividly into the occupational ex- 
perience of others. The first step is to do the kind of work 
that they do. 
Boys are given courses in woodworking in our schools, 
not because they are to become cabinet-makers or car- 
penters, but because they need an understanding of the hard 
and unyielding nature of the materials used in woodworking 
vocations; and a feeling of the arduous and monotonous toil 
necessary for shaping the materials into finished products. 
The woodworking is to give him the alphabet of experience 
in one wide field of human vocation. Its purpose is to open 
an experiential window out upon the world through which 
he can rightly see its labors. 
For the same reason we give many practical activities: 
metal-working, leather-work, printing, bookbinding, arts 
and crafts, cooking, sewing, embroidery, millinery, school 
gardening, weaving, rug-making, dyeing, painting, varnish- 
ing, pattern-making, pottery work, poultry care, laundry 
work, banking, buying and selling, practical accounting, 
and others. These activities give to boys and girls a sense 
of reality as to the nature of labor and of the materials used 
in the labor. The development of this sense of reality is one 
of the most urgent of necessities, especially for boys and 
girls who grow up in our cities. When our population was

mostly agricultural, the boy on the farm with hoe and rake 
and plough cultivated the fields; with axe and saw, he pro- 
vided fuel for the family, built and mended fences, bins, 
barns, and other farm structures. He pitched the hay, husked 
the corn, cut the feed, milked the cows, in all weathers, heat 
and cold and storm. Thus he secured his necessary sense 
of reality; his understanding of the hard and unyielding na- 
ture of the material world that lies at the basis of economic 
industry. The girl in sewing, cooking, mending, washing 
dishes, laundry, general housekeeping, canning and pre- 
serving, in helping with the poultry, the gardening, etc., was 
equally favored. They were well-trained in the Great 
School. 
But to-day in our towns and cities the boy has no spade 
or hoe, no axe or saw, no coal-hod, nor any other oppor- 
tunity for performing a portion of the world’s labor, and 
thereby acquiring a sanifying sense of reality. Except for his 
sports, perhaps, there is no call for him ever really to exert 
himself in any strenuous manner. The world moves visually 
before him; but on the vocational side, it is largely but a 
picture world like the motion picture on the screen. He sees 
men digging on our streets, but unless he has himself wielded 
the heavy tools of labor, and felt the burden that such men 
bear, he has not the experiential alphabet for understand- 
ing or appreciating the things that pass before his eyes. 
The deeper things of the situation are to be seen, not with 
the eyes, but with the sympathetic vision that has grown 
up out of like experience. Without this he may see the ex- 
ternals; he cannot, however, see the labor itself. Like one 
born blind who cannot know color, he is doomed to remain 
blind to the nature of actual realities. 
Since the purpose of the practical activities is the opening 
of experiential windows out over the diverse occupational 
fields, obviously the range of activities should be as wide as 
conditions permit.
-P-A-G-E-109
OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 101 
There should be work with wood — pine, oak, poplar, 
spruce, fir, hemlock, birch, maple, walnut, ash, cedar, ma- 
hogany, seasoned and unseasoned, straight and crooked, 
hard and soft, sapwood and heartwood, large rough work 
and fine accurate work. In connection with this naturally 
comes work with paints, oils, varnishes, stains, shellacs, 
alcohols, pumice, sandpaper, and other finishing materials. 
There should be work with metals — iron, steel, copper, 
brass, tin, aluminum, nickel, silver, alloys, wire, sheet metal, 
forgings, castings. Pupils should become acquainted with 
metals in the form of ores and compounds. - They should 
have an opportunity to reduce them, to refine them, to 
mould them in the foundry, and to shape them in the mak- 
ing of practical things. 
There should be work involving the application of elec- 
tricity to practical affairs — electric bells, wiring, toasters, 
cookers, irons, electric lighting, the telephone, the telegraph, 
clock controls, electro-plating, cells, dynamos, motors, with 
construction of these things. 
There should be work in printing, composition, typeset- 
ting, presswork, copper-plate-making, applied art and de- 
sign, bookbinding, cover-ornamentation, printing of bills, 
accounts, recipes, programs, invitations, supplementary 
material for classes, and the like. Closely related to this 
is cardboard construction, box-making, blotter-pads, desk- 
pads, ete. 
There should also be work involving leather — the mak- 
ing of bags, purses, portfolios, bil]-books, coverings of many 
kinds of balls, belts, satchels, suit-cases, trunks, handles, 
harness, upholstery, etc. All important kinds of leather 
should be used, as well as imitation leathers. Various kinds 
of dressings, finishings, preservatives should be employed. 
There should be work with clay and allied earth products, 
plaster of paris, cement, porcelain, glass; the actual making
-P-A-G-E-110
102 THE CURRICULUM 
of brick and tile, of lime and cement, from the original 
materials; pottery-making, cement-block construction, the 
making and mending of cement walks, bricklaying, tile- 
laying. The maintenance of the school plant affords excel- 
fent opportunities for practical labors of these types. 
A large field is that of textiles — wool, cotton, linen, silk, 
hemp, jute, Manila fiber, etc. So far as possible, the pupils 
should come into contact with the fibers in their original 
raw state; and understand through experience the kinds of 
labor involved in bringing them to finished form. With 
wool it should include the original washing, combing, card- 
ing, spinning, dyeing, weaving, fulling, shearing, shrinking, 
and pressing. Flax can be grown in the school garden, the 
fiber can be separated by the children themselves, spun, 
woven, and bleached. Other work is sewing and garment- 
making of every sort, with every usual kind of cloth — 
garment-design, garment-fitting, embroidery, millinery, 
laces, curtains, hangings, carpets, rugs, etc. 
Closely related to this is work with straw, raffia, cane, 
rattan, etc., in the making of mats, hats, baskets, trays, 
cases of various kinds, chair-seats, chair-backs, and cane 
furniture. 
There should be work with foods. This should involve 
cooking of all common kinds, canning, preserving, starch- 
making, sugar-making, oil manufacture, pickling, butter- 
making, cheese manufacture, condensed-milk manufacture. 
Closely connected with this is the making of soaps, and 
other cleansing agents. 
Not only should one have experiential opportunities in 
these fields of manufacture or transformation, but also in 
the production of the original raw materials in farm and 
garden. He should have an opportunity to raise corn, pota- 
toes, vegetables, fruits, etc., in sufficient quantity and vari- 
ety to learn the nature of the labors. He should have work 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 103 
involving soil preparation, fertilizing, seed-testing, planting, 
cultivating, protection from insects, drainage, irrigation, 
adaptation to seasonal conditions, harvesting, storing, mar- 
keting. He should have an opportunity likewise to work 
with poultry, live-stock, dairy cattle, bees, and with such 
other agricultural matters as the administrative limitations 
will permit. 
One’s education also requires some participation in the 
activities of the commercial world, buying and selling, com- 
petition, salesmanship, bookkeeping, accounting, the han- 
dling of money, banking, savings banks, insurance, ete. The 
school buys much; it ought to buy more in order to take 
care of the wide range of activities here indicated. The 
school at present sells little; it ought to sell very much more. 
These activities will require much bookkeeping and careful 
accounting. They will require banking and the handling of 
money. So far as it is administratively possible, conditions 
should be so devised that students can participate in these 
serious commercial activities. This is now being done in 
many schools where the pupils of the domestic science 
classes conduct the lunch-room, the supply-store, or where 
they do contract work in the shops. 
“All of these things?” the appalled teacher asks. In 
inclining toward the affirmative, let us point to the fact that 
practically every one of the occupations involved is already 
treated in our geographies. Now, what is the purpose of the 
book-study concerning occupations and products in the 
geography? Apparently it is an attempt to develop an 
understanding of the diversified human occupations. But 
how can this be developed through book-study if the chil- 
dren have not that alphabet of experience necessary for 
giving meaning to the words of the text? How can they 
appreciate the great cotton industry of the South, for ex- 
ample, as they read of it in their geographies, if they have 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 THE CURRICULUM 
never seen or handled or cultivated a cotton plant? How 
can they appreciate the process of ginning, as they read of 
it, if they have never had the experience of actually sepa- 
rating the fiber from the seeds? How can they appreciate 
the manufacture of cotton-seed oil, cotton-seed cake, etc., 
if they have never come into experiential contact with the 
cotton seed, and do not know whether it most resembles a 
mustard seed or a walnut? How appreciate the great cotton 
textile industries if they have never had anything to do 
with carding and spinning, weaving and dyeing? Without 
concrete experience with the occupational materials and 
processes, the students as they read the geographical treat- 
ment of occupations, but tread a hazy realm of verbal vague- 
ness, lit here and there with chance flashes from their inci- 
dental daily experience, but in general obscure and dimly 
visioned. 
Manual training throughout the elementary school and 
largely in the high school should have for a primary aim, 
not skill, not the production of a salable product, but an 
appreciation of the materials, processes, and products of a 
wide range of adult occupations. It is the most concrete 
portion of the home-geography of occupations. Combined 
with observation of neighborhood labors and products, we 
have the whole of home-geography on the occupational side. 
The major portion of the concrete activities at all stages 
of maturity will be on the order of play — constructive, 
operative, and participative. It seems that some of them, 
however, as training continues, should be raised to the plane 
of work. Without actual work in an atmosphere of work, 
with the spirit of work alive within the participants, they 
do not sufficiently enter into work-experience. Their activi- 
ties may have a commendable width and variety, but will 
be lacking in depth. In the later stages of the training, some- 
thing more is required than manual training in a play-shop.
-P-A-G-E-113
  OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 105 
Since the end of the training is an understanding of the 
World of Work, this serious level must therefore be reached 
and explored in some degree. It is this that makes necessary 
a certain amount of skill; the production of a salable eco- 
nomic product; and a genuine shop-atmosphere. The work- 
level will be most fully reached by the student in the things 
in which he is specializing; and generally through part-time 
codperative arrangements. 
2. Observation 
Having mastered the alphabet of experience, it is possi- 
ble for a student to enter into the world’s experience in 
more expeditious ways. The concrete experience gives the 
imagery and apperception materials; and the interests. The 
student is then equipped for understanding occupations 
through visit and observation. In cities opportunities are 
numerous. Many can be visited and viewed by young 
people in the course of their individual experience. Where 
inaccessible to incidental observation, in most cases man- 
agers are glad to arrange for systematic observation by 
classes or groups. 
Observation of occupations must be a portion of the 
preparation for the reading experiences. It must provide a 
portion of the imagery, the apperceptions-mass, and the 
interest. In the school shops, students can secure basic 
experience with materials, processes, and products; but the 
world of occupation there developed is diminutive, primi- 
tive, fragmentary, and sometimes a very artificial and dis- 
torted representation of the actual industry itself. To revert 
to our cotton-study illustration, students in the textile room 
can get pretty accurate ideas of fibers, dyes, the basic ele- 
ments of spinning and weaving machinery, and the nature 
of certain simple types of fabric. But the school shop as a 
whole bears little resemblance to a large textile mill with its 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
Rn pe ee NSE ney oe Weng te eee ee oe eR ECR get cor tee ere 
106 THE CURRICULUM 
great engines, its huge dyeing-vats and drying facilities, its 
countless spinning-machines and power-looms, and the 
bustle and whir of busy production. If for one’s reading one 
has only the meager imagery supplied by the school shop, 
then one has but poor preparation for it. We find here the 
justification for the ever-increasing use of motion-pictures 
for greatly extending one’s visual observation of concrete 
processes and conditions. 
Observation of an occupation is greatly quickened if the 
observer can be a participant and carry a portion of the 
responsibility. There is nothing like responsibility for giv- 
ing eyes to an individual; and especially eyes for values and 
relations. It is of immeasurably greater value for a boy to 
work for a season on a farm or in a store than it is merely 
to visit idly about the place. The observation through visit 
alone by classes or groups, and that for but a brief time, can 
give much valuable apperceptive imagery; but its limita- 
tions must be noted; and provision made, as far as possible, 
for actual participation in the labors of occupational groups. 
The pedagogy which sanctions the demand is simple and 
clear. The difficulty arises in connection with the adminis- 
tration of new activities that will not easily transfer to the 
schools. Present part-time arrangements are made only for 
specialized training. In time we may see our way clear for 
similar arrangements for some of the general training. 
Promise of this is to be found in the auspicious movement 
for promoting outside activities through giving credit for 
home work. 
One important type of observation relates to the study 
of the products of industry. Social supervision of industries 
is designed, among other things, to secure from the special- 
ized groups a type of product that fully meets human needs. 
general an industry will be left free to use whatever 
materials and processes that it chooses — on condition that  
-P-A-G-E-115
  OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 107 
they result in the right type of product. Of occupations in 
general, therefore, the public will need no detailed technical 
understanding of materials and processes. They need, how- 
ever, as consumers to be competent judges of the products of 
industry. Boys and girls coming out of our manual-training 
courses need not so much to be skilled in making furniture, 
, tools, electrical appliances, garments, curtains, etc., as to be 
skilled in judging the quality of such things as they are 
offered in the market. Their shop-training is valuable for 
developing judgment. But if their ideas are limited to what 
they meet in the school shops in making things, then their 
ideas will be too primitive, crude, and meager for adequate 
judgment of the products upon the market. The latter are 
immeasurably more complicated in countless subtle ways. 
One full department of training should, therefore, be the 
systematic and adequate study of the finished products of 
industry. Along with shop experience in making chairs, 
boys need to examine and discuss many types of chairs. 
They will be viewed in the light of principles of construc- 
tion, of utility, of esthetic design, and of economic costs. 
Along with the practical activities of girls in making cur- 
tains, for example, they need to refine and complete their 
powers of judgment through examination and study of 
many types of curtains in the light of general principles. 
Carried to its logical limits, this means that in many 
fields we need a continuous exhibit of products which reveal 
all types of excellence and defect. Though startling at first 
glance, the conclusion is inevitable. We discover here 
another need that once was simple enough not to require 
the work of the schools, which has grown so complex that 
it can be adequately taken care of in no other way. Recog- 
nition of the educational task is really appearing a long time 
after the work should have been undertaken. As a people 
we have been deceived long enough by those who have been
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 THE CURRICULUM 
in a position to profit by ignorance of materials, qualities, _ 
and prices. Just as occupational inefficiency needs to be over- | 
come in the field of production, so also it needs to be overcome in — 
the field of the consumer’s judgment. | 
But how can the schools have all the eXpensive things — 
needed for such an exhibit of economie products? Where 
can they be stored? How is deterioration to be prevented? 
How are perishable products to be taken care of? How 
meet the problem of ever-changing styles, and of current 
improvements? Would not much of the exhibit be obso- 
lete almost as soon as arranged? And how are obsolete 
but expensive things to be disposed of? 
Such questions grow out of a type of educational thought 
that, let us hope, will rapidly grow obsolete, — a type that 
assumes that everything needed in education must be found 
at the school plant. As a matter of fact, economic products 
must be observed where they can be observed effectively 
and economically. This is generally where they are manu- 
factured, stored for distribution, exhibited for sale; or where 
they are being used in home and street, in field and shop, 
and in the other places of the community. This constitutes 
a continuous community exhibit of the things. It permits 
them to be seen in their natural settings and relationships, 
taken out of which they lose half their significance. 
8. Occupational readings 
Occupations are to be seen in their nation-wide and 
world-wide distribution. The means must be mainly read- 
ing. This will be largely narrative in character. As one 
reads concerning any occupation, the aim will be the re- 
construction in the imagination of the reader of an inner 
world of occupational experiences in which, lost to sense 
of time and place, he can participate, as a shadow- 
member of the group, so to speak; and thus enter sympa-
-P-A-G-E-117
  OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 109 
thetically into the experiences with an intellectual and 
emotional vividness not greatly dissimilar to that which 
accompanies actual objective observatiox and participation. 
As one reads Captains Courageous, for example, one is for 
the time, so far as his consciousness is concerned, a fisher- 
man off the banks of Newfoundland, almost as completely 
as if he were there in the flesh. Then as one reads The 
Lumberman, one’s habitation is shifted to the wilds of Michi- 
gan in its early days, and one becomes an active and inter- 
ested participant in the logging industry along the rivers. 
Let him again at another time read a spirited history of 
transportation in our country from colonial times to the 
present. One becomes for a time an early colonist, and 
travels and transports his goods in the primitive ways. 
Later he is a shadow-member of the group about Robert 
Fulton as he labors with the problem of applying steam to 
river navigation. A little later he joins the other group and 
participates in the experiment of applying steam to over- 
land transportation. And thus the history, if concrete and 
vivid and full, reconstructs experience and permits him to 
be one with group after group and to participate in its 
affairs from early days down to the present. In the recon- 
structions of stirring narrative, one’s experience can be as 
much wider than observation as the latter is wider than the 
circle of one’s individual labors. 
The readings concerning occupations will be of a varied 
character: history, geography, literature, biography, travels, 
current events, stories of inventions, etc. 
Historical readings will be among the most vital for the 
purpose. It is truethat the practical thing desired is a knowl- 
edge of the occupation in its present status. But history 
is one of the best methods of showing the nature of the 
present. It reveals the constituents of a situation by show- 
ing the influences that have produced it; and which are
-P-A-G-E-118
    110 THE CURRICULUM 
continuing within it. It is impossible to understand the 
railroad situation at present, for example, without a fairly 
extensive understanding of the influences of former years 
that have made it what it now is. The same is true of the 
steel industry, the lumber industry, the relations between 
capital and labor, the growth of labor unions, etc. Not only 
does history reveal the facts, but if the human element is 
kept foremost, it reveals them in assimilable ways. One can 
enter sympathetically into the labors of the human groups 
the story of which is ‘being read. Such imaginative partici- 
pation contains many of the factors of real participation, 
and more nearly approximates the nature of the latter than 
commonly supposed. 
Public education has scarcely yet recognized the legiti- 
zaacy of the purposes treated in this chapter. It is not sur- 
prising, therefore, that history is not used in our schools as 
a mode of revealing the growth and present nature of oc- 
cupations. The little given in our historical textbooks is 
so minute, fragmentary, general, and vague, that it cannot 
be intended by the writers for the purposes mentioned. 
For example, taking a dozen textbooks in United States 
history commonly used in the elementary schools, and eight 
texts commonly used in the high schools, it was found that 
the average number of pages devoted to occupational topics 
was so small as to be negligible for training. The number of 
pages is shown in the following table: —

If any one believes the average treatment of these topics 
to be sufficient, he can easily test the matter. Let him send 
the five pages on banks and banking to a list of prominent 
bankers requesting their judgment whether it presents an 
adequate revelation of the growth of banking in our coun- 
try, and as its outcome, an adequate picture of its present 
status. Let him send the three or five pages on railroad 
development to prominent leaders of the railroad world with 
a similar request. Let him inquire of labor unions if the two 
or three pages devoted to them present a satisfactory ac- 
count of the development of their present status and rela- 
tions. It is not difficult to predict the character of the replies. 
For each of these topics, and for many others, there is 
demonstrable need of a full historical treatment. Justice is 
not to be done to the railroad situation, for example, short 
of two hundred or five hundred pages. This should present 
in concrete, vivid narrative a reconstruction of experiences 
involved in the development of railroads, beginning with  
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 THE CURRICULUM 
the early inventions and experiments, and tracing the 
expansion of lines and systems down to the present. The 
story should fully present the personal experiences of rail- 
road leaders and groups: only as the “human element ” is 
central in the story can the reader actually relive the experi- 
ences. But at the same time it should reveal fundamental 
processes and relationships of all kinds: the social influences 
that called railroads into being; kinds and amounts of serv- 
ice rendered to different regions; modes of organization, 
financing, regulation, wages, conditions of work, etc. The 
story should be so written that the reader can see and appre- 
ciate the valiant national service that the railroads have 
rendered in pushing back the frontiers and opening up the 
wilderness for civilization; in carrying the means of civilized 
life to every corner of our land; in breaking down isolation, 
provincialism, and seclionalism; and in promoting the gen- 
eral intra-national welfare. The story should be presented 
so vividly and sympathetically that the reader can enter 
whole-heartedly into the action. This provides right condi- 
tions for leaving large residues of information acquired 
through living rather than memorizing; and the materials 
and experiences out of which the abstract general principles 
are to be distilled. 
Each vocation is also to be seen geographically in its 
nation-wide and world-wide distribution. One is interested 
in those portions that touch one’s own affairs; but world- 
wide interdependency makes this the whole of the world’s 
industry. The price of wheat, for example, in any com- 
munity is determined, not by the amount raised in that 
community, but by the world-situation as regards wheat. 
Rightly to understand it one must read a long chapter on 
the geography of wheat —a chapter that changes from 
year to year. Likewise he must read similar chapters on all 
of the important occupations. Recent books are providing 
excellent materials for the purpose.
-P-A-G-E-121
  OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING 113 
Lack of space forbids discussion here of the occupational 
illumination to be provided by literature, travels, biography, 
current events, popular technology, stories of inventions. 
Each has a large function to perform; and should find large 
place in the curriculum of occupational training. 
4. Generalization 
In the foregoing we have stressed concrete experiences. 
But each provides materials for discussion, problem-solving, 
abstraction of elements and relations, and generalizations. 
The work in the shops, sewing-rooms, kitchens, gardens, 
etc., will provide basic materials for generalized understand- 
ing of design, physical science, biological science, mathemat- 
ics, economic relationships, etc. The history, geography, 
travels, current events, ete., will not confine themselves 
merely to a concrete construction of life in other ages and 
lands. These experiences are preparatory to generalizations. 
Pupils are to see the broad lines of influence that operate 
in human affairs; to see how some of them may promote 
human welfare, and how others may prevent or destroy; 
and to see how the influences have been and may be con- 
trolled for human good. It is in this connettion that un- 
derstanding of most of the economic and social principles 
required for effective social supervision is to be developed.

EDUCATION FOR CITIZENSHIP 
 
-P-A-G-E-124

CHAPTER XI 
THE NATURE OF THE GOOD CITIZEN 
Epvcation cannot take the first step in training for citi- 
zenship until it has particularized the characteristics of the 
good citizen. The training task is to develop those charac- 
teristics. It is not enough to aim at “good citizenship” in 
a vague general way. As well aim at “medicine” in a large 
vague way in the training of a physician. 
The citizen has functions to perform. We are to develop 
ability to perform those functions. But first we must know 
with particularity what they are. He must have certain 
social attitudes, valuations, criteria of judgment. We can- 
not effectively train for these, except as we have rather 
accurately defined them. He must have knowledge; but 
we must know how and where he is to use it before we can 
know what to give; or how much; or how to focus it. 
The need of definite objectives is obvious. It will be a 
long time, however, before our profession can have any 
reasonably complete list upon which to base a system of 
training. And the reason is, citizens are not sufficiently 
agreed among themselves as to the characteristics of the 
good citizen, or his modes of thought and action. They 
agree so long as they talk mere vagueness; they disagree 
the moment they begin to particularize. And education 
must be built upon the particulars. 
The primitive good citizen 
We can best indicate the essential nature of the good citi- 
zen by first noting the situation in the small primitive tribes 
of our ancestors before the growth of complex institutions
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 THE CURRICULUM 
obscured the relationships. In those early times, the human 
race was broken up into innumerable small tribes. Each 
had little or no connection with its neighbors. Owing to the 
severe limitations upon the food-supply and other necessi- 
ties, and to the tendency within tribes to expand, each tribe 
was usually hostile to neighboring tribes. There was always 
a state of active or slumbering war. 
Continuing existence of the tribe demanded considerable 
social solidarity. In the common struggles with the enemy 
and with the hostile forces of Nature, each member of the 
tribewas expected to codperate fully with the other members, 
He must deal fairly and honestly with his own people. He 
must lend assistance to those in need of it. He must be 
loyal to the group, and obedient to constituted authority. 
He must restrain his anti-social passions, and adjust his 
efforts to promote the tribal welfare. Without this solidar- 
ity, the group disintegrated and was destroyed by better- 
organized neighbors. So indispensable was group-cohesion 
and social virtues that man was endowed with powerful 
social instincts. Nature made sure of this type of social 
service. 
On the other hand, for the tribe to survive under those 
hard conditions of primitive struggle, each individual = 
to be prepared to fight alien tribes. The rightful attitude o: 
an individual toward members of alien groups was therefore 
anti-social, hostile, destructive. Toward the alien he was 
expected to exercise deceit, stratagem, treachery, and vio- 
lence. He must despoil them of their property, enslave 
them, or destroy them. This exercise of anti-social attitudes 
toward the alien was as necessary and as virtuous as the 
exercise of the social attitudes toward the members of his 
own group. The tribe that would not fight was destroyed, 
root and branch. This resistance to the enemy was so im- 
portant that Nature gave to man a full array of fighting  
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE NATURE OF THE GOOD CITIZEN 119 
instincts. In this manner, she set her seal of approval upon 
anti-social attitudes and action. She made sure also of this 
second type of social service to one’s own group. 
In his relations to other individuals, conditions forced 
upon primitive man two standards of conduct, two sets of 
attitudes, two sets of virtues. The good citizen of the tribe 
was the one who most vigorously exercised the social virtues 
toward the members of his tribe, and who most valiantly 
exercised the anti-social virtues toward members of the 
alien tribes. The bad citizen was the one who exercised the 
hostile virtues toward his fellow-tribesmen and the friendly 
virtues toward the aliens. 
Intra-group virtues Extra-group virtues 
Mutual aid; social service Injury; destruction 
Fair-dealing Double-dealing; treachery 
Truthfulness; honesty Deceit; stratagem 
Loyalty ; obedience Hostility; opposition 
Modesty; humility Arrogance 
Submission to group opinion Defiance; antagonism 
Courtesy Incivility 
Self-restraint Unbridled freedom 
Gentleness; mercy Ruthlessness 
In the table the two opposite sets of virtues are placed 
over against each other. The good citizen of the primitive 
tribe had to be active in the exercise of both. But he must 
exercise each toward its rightful object of reference. He 
must not reverse them. In so doing, he became guilty of 
the two sets of crimes. To exercise anti-social attitudes 
toward the members of his own group was to select the 
wrong objects for their reference and therefore to commit 
crime. On the other hand, to exercise the social virtues 
toward members of alien groups was to be guilty of render- . 
ing aid to one’s enemies, the capital crime of treason. 
Whether an act toward another human being or group of 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 THE CURRICULUM 
human beings was virtuous or vicious depended not upon 
the nature of the act itself, but wpon the object of reference. 
To kill women and children, for example, in that day was 
virtuous conduct, if they belonged to alien tribes; it was 
criminal conduct, if they were of one’s own tribe. Any kind 
of human conduct toward another was good, or any kind 
was bad; it all depended upon the person toward whom it 
was exercised. Virtue or vice lay not in the act itself; but 
in the right social placing of the act. Virtues and vices were 
relative things, not absolutes. 
The modern situation 
As a result of the long-continued group-struggle of primi- 
live days, the weaker tribes disappeared and the stronger 
tribes grew fewer in number and larger in population and 
territorial area. This absorption or destruction of the weak 
by the strong has continued down to the present day until 
there now exists over the habitable globe only some forty 
' or fifty independent national groups. The situation with 
respect to the two sets of social attitudes, however, does not 
change with the size of the group. It cannot change so long 
as wholly independent competing nations exist. Within 
the large nation, no less than in primitive days, there still 
remains the need of inner solidarity and the exercise of the 
social virtues. Toward the alien nations, however, in the 
degree that they are felt to be alien, one is still expected 
to employ the anti-social attitudes. Between these larger 
nations there is, as of old, a constant hostility. This is not 
always on the surface. With war so expensive and destruc- 
tive now, nations live mostly in a state of truce, — simply 
because anything else is suicidal in the end, and not because 
the world has developed the fundamental basis of peace. 
The slumbering presence of extra-group hostility is re- 
vealed by the ease with which it flares forth at the slightest 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE NATURE OF THE GOOD CITIZEN 121 
provocation, and the ease with which it bursts into the 
flames of war even in the case of nations that we have been 
accustomed to call civilized. The independent national 
groups still cling to the two standards of conduct and regard 
both as wholly justifiable, legitimate, and virtuous, if only 
exercised toward the right objects of reference. In times of 
international stress, when both intra-group and extra-group 
standards of conduct are fully aroused, and when the grow- 
ing but yet feeble sentiment of membership in a world 
group is stilled in the strife, then the anti-social dictates 
become clear and unconfused. To kill the man who is not 
a member of one’s own nation becomes a matter of entire 
virtue. It is not a crime. It is not a matter for reproach. It 
calls for decorations of honor. At the present moment it is 
the largest, the most expensively equipped and the most 
completely organized business in the world. 
The nations have institutionalized their anti-social tend- 
encies. They have developed laws, traditions, public opin- 
ion, military technique, organization, training, weapons, 
and other appliances for destroying aliens. And through 
newspapers, schools, churches, and public proclamations, 
they have arranged to make and to keep all people fully 
conscious of their anti-social duties, powers, and possibilities. 
In relation to the wholly alien nation, then, who is the 
good citizen? It is the one who is ready and eager to fight 
the alien the instant called upon; who is ready to shed his 
blood to the last drop in service to his countrymen. It is 
the one whose thought and feeling and action are most 
completely anti-social — with these turned squarely against 
the hostile alien. 
We may deprecate a world-situation which makes murder 
and destruction an inescapable part of social service; and 
therefore a necessary function of the good citizen. The situ- 
ation is what it is, however; and not what we may wish it 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 THE CURRICULUM 
tobe. The world is still young and in the green; and yet far 
from organized and civilized. An undesirable form of social 
service is not to be escaped by blinking it; but by so chang- 
ing the world-situation that the noxious type of service is 
no longer necessary to continuing national existence and 
welfare. 
Patriotism we say is a characteristic of the good citizen. 
But in our present state of world-division, there are two 
types of patriotism, wholly different, and both indispen- 
sable for national welfare. We are here referring to one 
of the types, the one that is built upon the anti-alien rela- 
tions. It is the desire to serve one’s own national group by 
restraining or injuring, or even if necessary destroying, 
alien groups. It is the aroused anti-social spirit. It is a state 
of mind that in the nature of things must persist so long as 
this whirling planet holds mankind-in-division. 
But let us turn to the other and more agreeable side of 
the picture. The national groups not only institutionalize 
the spirit of world-division for their outside relations; but 
also build ponderous and stable national institutions upon 
the intra-social impulses of mankind-in-codperation. For 
promoting the welfare of the group within, the more ad- 
vanced nations — even though their hands now are reeking 
with the blood of alien human-kind — have been providing 
and developing the humanitarian institutions necessary toa 
superb state of civilization. They have been building schools 
and churches; and fostering within their boundaries the 
reign of intelligence and good-will. They have been pro- 
viding hospitals for the sick, systematic state care for the 
weak, pensions for the aged and the incapacitated, work- 
men’s compensation for the injured in industry, protection 
of women and children from industrial exploitation, eight- 
hour laws for workmen, the enforcement of sanitary living 
and work conditions; and a host of other human-welfare 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE NATURE OF THE GOOD CITIZEN 123 
measures. And they have zealously promoted in a thousand 
ways those social institutions which perform for a people 
the basic intra-group services: industry, commerce, trans- 
portation, mining, agriculture, professional service, etc. 
Thus institutions growing out of the social virtues flourish 
profusely in nations that show no abhorrence to the most 
inhuman brutalities when exercised toward alien peoples. 
And press and schools and churches diligently foster this 
internal socialization; and the awakening of a sensitive 
social conscience that is keenly cognizant of intra-group 
obligation. 
This brings us to the other type of patriotism—the aroused 
spirit of intra-group service. It is the desire to serve one’s 
national group by promoting in every possible way those in- 
ternal social adjustments and actions that make in maxi- 
mum degree for the general national welfare. Instead of its 
being hatred of the enemy as in the other type, it is love of 
one’s people, and of all of one’s people; and positive. This 
type of patriotism is in need of greater emphasis since it is not 
so clearly conceived. It is codrdinate with the other. But 
to most men the term refers only to the anti-social type. 
Men take great pride in self-sacrifice, and are willing to lay 
down even life itself, to promote the welfare of their people, 
so long as it is the anti-alien type of social service. Why 
should there not be equal willingness for self-sacrifice in the 
service of those same people when the service is social? 
And why should not the intra-group service be equally hon- 
ored? Civic training should complete our ideas of patriot- 
ism; and develop attitudes of both types — so long as both 
are needed. 
Functional differentiation 
As social groups grow large territorially, they break up 
along functional lines into small groups again: commercial, 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
    1%4 THE CURRICULUM 
manufacturing, agricultural, religious, political, professional, 
and others. The lower limit in size is the specialized individ- 
ual standing alone. 
With the appearance of the functional small groups, there 
arise naturally and inevitably the two standards of social 
conduct. Human nature is so made that without thought 
we adopt the social attitudes toward members of our own 
social group: our own political party, our own church, com- 
mercial organization, political ring, fraternity, club, trade- 
union, employers’ union, school, college, or other organi- 
zation to which we may belong. In the same natural way, 
without taking thought, we adopt the extra-group attitudes 
toward those who belong to outside or competing groups: 
the opposite political party, other financial, commercial, or 
manufacturing organizations, the churches of the other 
groups, the rival college, the close-fisted employers’ associ- 
ation, or the striking labor-union. 
One belongs to many overlapping groups and over all he 
belongs to the city, state, and national groups which include 
all of these. He has a conception of his membership in each 
of them. This complicated consciousness tends to soften and 
partially inhibit the workings of the anti-social attitudes 
in connection with one’s small-group activities. Leaving 
aside this qualification, we must notice that as one’s con- 
sciousness of membership within the small group becomes 
intense, he adopts the two standards of conduct and looks 
upon both as equally virtuous. They have been so re- 
garded by mankind from the beginning of the world. Both 
are powerfully supported by instincts; back of each are 
powerful traditions. As a result both are considered equally 
right and necessary if only the one is exercised toward 
one’s friends and the other toward outsiders. 
A labor-union offers a good example. The members of the 
union extend mutual aid to all within the group. They aid
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE NATURE OF THE GOOD CITIZEN 125 
in securing employment; in holding their positions; in the 
regulation of hours, wages, factory protection, sanitary 
conditions, etc. In times of sickness or loss of place, the 
necessary material assistance is extended. Toward each 
other within the union, after excepting the occasional wolf 
in sheep’s clothing that preys upon ignorance, there is, on 
the whole, fair-dealing, honesty, truthfulness, loyalty, obe- 
dience, and submission to whatever regulations are neces- 
sary for the welfare of the union. However rough and igno- 
rant the men may be, these social virtues grow up within 
the group in their relations toward each other about as luxu- 
riantly as among the individuals of any social class. On 
the other hand, the union holds just as strictly to the extra- 
group, anti-social standard of conduct in their relations to 
the opposing employers’ groups. Industry exists in division. 
Hence there is constant hostility. While active warfare 
flames forth only occasionally, the usual situation is one of 
truce, not of peace. The union stands ready to over-reach 
employers when opportunity offers. They combine to limit 
the output of each man. They tend to “soldier,” to mis- 
manage, to delay progress so as to extend the work. It is in 
times of acute trouble, however, that the extra-group at- 
titudes reveal themselves most clearly. ‘The union often 
strives to wreck or destroy the machinery and the mate. 
rials belonging to the hostile employers. The labor strike is 
often a state of actual armed warfare. They will not work 
until their demands are granted, and others shall not work. 
Where persuasion will not serve, force must be employed. 
The unions justify the use of force by saying that it is class 
war. They use the term in its literal sense, not in a figura- 
tive one. It is a struggle for the group that grows out of ad- 
herence to the world-old extra-group standard of conduct. 
It has exactly the same kind of justification as any other 
kind of war. We shall not make headway in understand- 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 THE CURRICULUM 
ing the civic factors that enter into the situation unless we 
grant the warring union entire sincerity of conviction as to 
the rightfulness of adhering to both standards of conduct. 
They are acting as the race has always acted from the begin- 
ning of the world when divided into opposing and hostile 
small groups. To dispense with either of the standards so 
long as industry exists in division can result in but injury 
or destruction for their group. Even though they may wish 
to dispense with the extra-group attitudes, the condition of 
social division will not permit. 
It is not that the men are vicious. It is the state of indus- 
try-in-division that is vicious. To say that the men are in- 
herently ill-disposed and that they destroy simply for the 
love of destruction is to miss the whole secret of the matter. 
They are usually more rough and ignorant than their ac- 
cusers, because they have had fewer educational oppor- 
tunities; but they are not less honest nor less sincere; nor 
less virtuous when measured by the dual standard of virtue 
forced upon them by the presence of social division. They 
are using the same standards of conduct as their opponents. 
For it must be kept in mind that there are always at least 
two parties to a fight; and that when the fighting is fierce 
upon the one side it is no less fierce upon the other. The visi- 
ble struggle of the labor-unions is proof of an equally stren- 
uous opposition upon the part of the employing groups. 
Let us reverse the illustration. The employers’ groups have 
their same two standards of social ethics; and they live up 
to the standards forced upon them by conditions in the same 
vigorous and manly way. In their conduct toward each 
other, one sees revealed all of the social virtues at their 
best. They stand together and support each other in the pro- 
motion of measures designed to further the welfare of their 
groups, and in resisting injurious measures. They keep each 
other’s counsels. They place opportunities in each other’s
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE NATURE OF THE GOOD CITIZEN 127 
way. They pass on information which can be used. They 
extend credit to each other on a more generous basis than 
that granted to outsiders. They fix prices, eliminate com- 
petition, make “gentlemen’s” trade agreements, — and to 
each other their word is their bond. As a matter of fact, it is 
in the business world where one will find the highest ex- 
amples of consistent and tenacious adherence to the social 
standards of group ethics. When one seeks an example of 
honesty that is unshakable, of fidelity to trust that is free 
from the breath of every suspicion, one will find it most 
frequently among the responsible leaders in the business 
world. This is, however, to refer to but one side of their dual 
ethical system. Opposed to them is the labor group and the 
great body of consumers. These are alien groups; and in 
proportion as they are conceived to be alien, the anti-social 
predatory standard rises strong and becomes the rule of 
action. Until recently they have had little care as to how 
much they injure or destroy the laborer. They have refused 
to install protective devices or to make factories sanitary 
until they are compelled to do so. They have refused to cut 
down hours and have been willing to work men in twelve- 
or even sixteen-hour shifts without care as to the effects upon 
them. They have given out false statements as to capitali- 
zation, costs, expenses of production, profits, and in other 
ways have sought to prevent the opposing labor organi- 
zations from obtaining their rights. They have circulated 
blacklists to keep out of their shops those who are especially 
strenuous in fighting the battles of labor. They have placed 
provocateurs in the labor camps to discredit labor in the 
eyes of the public. But in thus holding to one social standard 
in their conduct toward each other, and to a wholly differ- 
ent standard toward the laboring men, the employing class 
is doing what is in the nature of the situation forced upon 
them. Where such group oppositions exist, the rise of the
-P-A-G-E-136
    128 THE CURRICULUM 
two standards is inevitable. We must see the anti-social 
opposition to labor’s welfare as a sincere and honest adher- 
ence to a dual ethical standard that the world has always 
accepted; and which it yet accepts. It is human nature in 
the face of social division. 
Let the managerial groups lay down their oppositions un- 
der present social conditions, and grant all that opposing la- 
bor and consumer groups may demand, — and they but com- 
mit economic suicide. “Big business,” no more than labor, 
is vicious or criminal. Our social problem is not a matter of 
dealing with “malefactors of great wealth,” but rather with 
the maleficent results of society-in-division. The divided- 
ness is the malefactor. 
Illustrations are as numerous as small groups. Take the 
case of the corrupt political ring. Within such a group of 
gray wolves there is a tremendous social solidarity. One 
finds the social virtues blossoming as luxuriantly as they 
can be found anywhere. Thére is loyalty and obedience to 
the chief. Group secrets are kept inviolate. There is mu- 
tual service within the group in the getting of offices, polit- 
ical jobs, political contracts, access to the public crib, ete. 
One hears endless praises of the leaders because of their help- 
fulness and never-ending kindness toward the individuals 
of their class. In carrying forward these activities it matters 
not to them how much they injure the welfare of the other 
social groups. These are alien; and therefore legitimate prey. 
In proportion as one’s social vision and social conscious- 
ness are limited to one’s membership in the small group, 
with ignorance of large-group existences and relationships, 
one will hold to the primitive dual standard of conduct. 
Though good to his friends, he is the undesirable citizen. 
In proportion as one’s social vision and social conscious- 
ness are widened so that one comes to have a vivid con- 
ception of one’s membership in the large group, then the
-P-A-G-E-137
    THE NATURE OF THE GOOD CITIZEN 129 
anti-social attitudes and standards tend to fade and dis- 
appear and to leave as the rule of conduct only the social 
ethics of civilized humanity. Of this type is the good citizen 
in a state of civilization. 
Let one continue this line of thought and note the special 
attitudes and antagonisms among business groups, political 
parties, ecclesiastical organizations, medical and healing 
groups, etc., each with its own special dual system of ethics, 
and one can realize that in educating for citizenship we are 
to prepare to deal with some very obdurate aspects of hu- 
man nature; and with intractable institutionalized small- 
group attitudes and traditions. If the training is to be vital, 
not merely some remote hearsay affair, students need to be 
brought into experiential contact with the realities them- 
selves. That the training problems bristle with difficulties 
is easily evident. Every one of these small groups stands 
over against other small groups and equally against the 
large group. Its ethics not only demands that it fight com- 
petitor small groups, but that it also fight the large group 
when the latter refuses to let it pursue its group-ends with- 
out molestation. It therefore follows the dictates of virtue 
when it fights education for large-group valuations. And 
its blows have the vigor and persistence of sincerity; and 
equally the underhandedness that is fully sanctioned as a 
major virtue of the extra-group type. 
Interdependence of specialized groups 
We now come to the fourth level of our genetic story. 
The differentiation of the national group into small func- 
tional groups has as its obverse side the interdependence of 
the small groups. This again welds the small groups into 
anew and higher form of large-group solidarity. Each be- 
comes dependent upon all the others; and the others depend- 
ent upon it. The oneness of the specialized groups becomes
-P-A-G-E-138
  130 THE CURRICULUM 
as clear as the oneness of the bodily organism with its special- 
ized members. As this recognition rises clear, consciousness 
of membership within the large group becomes dominant 
in the members of all of the specialized groups and the 
extra-group attitudes of antagonism between constituent 
classes disappear. All come to accept the intra-group stand- 
ards as the rules of civic conduct; the extra-group standards 
disappear; and good citizenship on the part of all is achieved. 
This level of social evolution, this subjective good citizen- 
ship which alone can bring the actual, has been but partially 
reached. The climb is yet a toilsome one. But the speed that 
we have recently been making, and the ease with which we 
have been responding to newly recognized social obligation 
promise great civic achievement in the years just ahead of 
us. And since the problem at bottom is one of creating sub- 
jective attitudes and valuations, it is mainly a problem for 
the educational profession. And the first problem —a 
most baffling one —is to draw up a curriculum that will 
with certainty forge an enduring and vitalized large-group 
consciousness,
-P-A-G-E-139
  CHAPTER XII 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENLIGHTENED LARGE-GROUP 
CONSCIOUSNESS 
Tus problem of civic training is par excellence the develop- 
ment of large-group consciousness. If men understand the 
large-group social relations, and have right attitudes toward 
each other and toward the social whole, these automatically 
impel toward right action. Education will develop the emo- 
tional aspects of large-group consciousness for the sake of 
propelling power; and the intellectual aspects for the sake 
of guidance. 
Let us first ask, How does one develop a genuine feeling of 
membership in a social group, whether large or small? There 
seems to be but one method and that is, To think and feel and 
act with the group as a part of it as it performs its activities 
and strives to attain its ends. Individuals are fused into 
coherent small groups, discordant small groups are fused 
into the large internally-codperating group, when they act 
together for common ends, with common vision, and with 
united judgment. 
Let us take for illustration that group-consciousness 
called “college spirit.” The high-school youth who has not 
yet chosen his college is likely to have little or no interest 
in the success or failure of any particular college athletic 
team to which he sees reference in the daily press. But after 
he has entered a particular college, and has come to partici- 
pate in its affairs, then the situation is altogether changed. 
His sympathies are with one group and with its team; and 
the more strenuously he exerts himself in promoting its 
welfare, the more keenly does he realize his common mem- 
bership in the group, and the more willing does he become
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 THE CURRICULUM 
to sink personal self-interest for the welfare of his college 
group. “College spirit” is the flower and fruit of action. 
This action may be of other types than athletic; but action 
for common ends there must be or there is no healthy growth 
of the sentiment of solidarity. 
Merely to find one’s self a passive member of a group is 
not enough. The member of the college who does not 
participate actively in its affairs remains cold, aloof, un- 
sympathetic. He does not fuse with the group. College 
spirit does not and cannot grow in such soil. And the prin- 
ciple is of universal application. The man who is passively 
made a member of a church or political organization, but 
who never does anything by way of promoting the common 
purposes of the group, will never attain any vital conscious- 
ness of membership in the organization. Like a piece of 
cold iron that cannot be welded, he remains detached, sepa- 
rate, apart. Man finds his normal social life only in action; 
and he attains a realization of his normal relationships only 
through action. 
One of the arguments in favor of national wars is that 
more than anything else they cement national solidarity. 
This is because they represent group-action of the most 
strenuous and the most fully emotionalized type: actions 
and emotions that lie close to elemental instincts. The sub- 
stitute for war that civilization is to find must have as its 
major ingredient group-action that is strenuous and emo- 
tionalized. Wanting this, there can be no effective and 
abiding national solidarity. The substitute need not equal 
war in its momentary power; for what it lacks in power may 
be made up in continuity of action. 
Reconstruction of experience through language 
The political groups of which one is a member are State- 
wide, Nation-wide. One’s occupational or religious group is 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 133 
no less widely distributed. Clearly one can never observe 
his whole group directly; nor in his participation come into 
contact with more than a tiny fragment of the total-group 
labors. For width of vision and of contacts, therefore, one 
needs methods that are not so much limited by space and 
time relations. Hence, we must note the place of indirect 
or vicarious observation and participation through reading. 
To resume our example, a college student may develop 
a large degree of college spirit and yet actually see and in 
the flesh perform but a very small portion of the common 
action. Kept away from it by other duties or by enforced 
absence, he may enter into it all through participative imag- 
jnation as he reads the current happenings in the college 
paper. During such reading, he is lost to actual time and 
place, and for the moment dwells in the midst of the group- 
action. As a shadow-member of the group, he participates 
in all that is going on. He wishes and wills and hopes and 
feels and becomes emotionally heated like those actually in 
the fray — especially if he can also talk to somebody about 
it, and thus actively and socially stir the inner fires. By 
such means, his spirit is warmed and shaped, — his group- 
attitudes, valuations, and sense of solidarity. 
Now, as a matter of fact, in a large institution most col- 
lege students do not actually see or enter into much of the 
activity. They only hear about it through conversation and 
reading. In the case of one’s national political party, or of 
the religious denomination to which one belongs, this re- 
moteness of the individual and his dependence upon report 
is much more pronounced. And still more so is it in the case 
of the all-embracing national group. The normal mode of 
participation in the affairs of the very large group involves 
the doing of but a tiny fragment of the labors of the whole, 
and of seeing but little more with the eyes of sense. But 
as one sees and does the little, with his inner vision he sees
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 THE CURRICULUM 
the whole as he reads, and feels himself a member of the total 
group and performing a part of its action. 
We must carry this thought one step farther. One’s 
participation in the group-activity instead of being one per 
cent objective and ninety-nine per cent subjective, may, 
without noticeable change of character, be one hundred 
per cent subjective. Let one take, for example, a good nar- 
rative account of the Persian wars of the Greeks. This 
reconstructs subjectively the experience of the armies of 
Miltiades and Leonidas just as clearly as our current press 
reconstructs for our subjective participation the action of 
yesterday of our political party, our church, or our own 
national group. We can enter into the action with the same 
completeness and abandon. Language reconstructs the dis- 
tant past with the same ease and clearness as the past of 
but an hour ago; action on the other side of the earth, as 
easily as that on the next street. 
Language is preéminently the organ of social vision. With 
the eyes of sense one sees but a little way, and sees but frag- 
ments of group-action; even within one’s own town. But 
language lifts the curtain upon all the earth. It enables 
one to see and know and relive all types of human experience. 
If the record is everywhere equally complete, the things are 
seen without the distortion of visual perspective which 
makes near things large and far things small. Civic educa- 
tion must, therefore, make large use of reading that is con- 
crete enough to permit vicarious participative experience. 
The creation of a large-growp consciousness 
Now, how do citizens act together in large-group wayst 
And how can children and youth participate in such action, 
so as to become fused in consciousness with the large group? 
Let us begin with the national group, since the problems 
are in many respects simpler than in the case of the munici-

LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 135 
pal or other local group. Our national group for some gen- 
erations has had its separate identity in the always quarrel- 
some family of nations. For the maintenance of its political 
existence it has had to hold itself at least reasonably united 
against foreign aggression. Occasionally it has had to act. 
At the present moment the Nation is engaged in such a life- 
and-death struggle. For the promotion of its material wel- 
fare, it has had as a national group to compete with other 
aggressive commercial nations in the markets of the earth. 
For preventing schism and internal disintegration it has 
often had to array itself actively against States and special- 
ized groups and to force them to subordinate their special 
interests to the greater good of the whole. It has had cease- 
lessly to keep a strong hand upon the activities of powerful 
special groups, always actively or potentially predatory; 
and in the nature of the case this must always continue. It 
has long fought, and is always fighting, at the gateways of 
our land, with the things that cause disease in man and 
beast and plant; and this warfare grows in intensity, and 
can never cease. In regions of flood, aridity, and obstructed. 
- navigation, upon dangerous reefs and shores, in the national 
_ forests, and otherwhere and in many ways, we are as a 
national group making war against the adverse forces of 
Nature. Within recent years our national group is seen to 
be girding itself for war upon national ignorance, national 
weakness, national inefficiency of many kinds. 
When teachers are asked how to improve the teaching 
of our national history they frequently say, “Omit or abbre- . 
viate the wars.’ But in the above enumeration, it will be 
observed that most action can be expressed in terms of con- 
flict. Life, whether individual or national, especially the 
serious part of it, is largely made up of overcoming obstacles. 
Man’s serious life is mainly a battle with opposing forces. 
These may be men or animals, disease or ignorance, winter

or famine, or powerful forces of Nature. But fight them he 
must; and he lives mainly in the fight, — so far as his seri- 
ous moments are concerned. And even his best play is the 
mock-fight. 
To participate actively in the wars of the national group 
is to act with it when its action is most strenuous and when 
its solidarity is most conscious. Let youth, therefore, mingle 
with the group at such times and they will then rapidly and 
effectively take on a vitalized nationalistic consciousness. 
For this reason, let youth continue to refight the colonial 
wars, the Revolutionary War, and the later wars with Eng- 
land, Spain, Mexico, and the Indian tribes. Let the accounts 
of these fights be so presented that youth can refight them 
in that spirited, intense, and whole-hearted way that is 
congenial to its hot blood; and which is necessary for firing 
the enthusiasms of youth and for indissolubly fusing the 
individual into conscious and acquiescent membership in 
the national group. The “man without a country” is the 
man who has never fought with his group for his group. 
Since the historical account is to be used primarily as a 
means of reconstructing the group experience, the reading 
must not be simply an abstract sociological and political 
analysis of conditions, of causes and effects, etc.; and dull 
chronological record of happenings. The purpose should be 
living; and learning through living. If the group-life of those 
stirring times is relived in the right way, there will be no 
dearth of proper learning. 
This reconstruction of experience requires that the whole 
national fight be presented from the point of view of the 
participants upon one side. When one relives the fight, he 
has to be on one side or the other. If he is neutral, then he 
is not reliving the fight. He is an idle bystander. He will not 
be warmed by vicarious participation. His consciousness 
will not be effectively nationalized. He will remain a man
-P-A-G-E-145
  LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 137 
without a country. This need of taking the point of view of 
the participants on one side or the other is intuitively 
recognized by the writers of our textbooks and by teachers 
in their discussion. Its purpose must be seen and the method 
made conscious, however, because of the demand often 
voiced that historical presentation, on even the concrete 
levels, be coldly scientific, and look at the actions of all sides 
equally and without sympathy. Our apparently contrary 
suggestion does not imply any deviation from exact his- 
torical truth in the presentation. It is only to recognize the 
principle of perspective; and the local and partial nature of 
all active experience. The participants on one side in a bat- 
tle, let us say, may see the whole action truly, — from their 
side, — and yet have a different vision, different object- 
ives and emotional experiences from those of their oppo- 
nents. It is true, in entering sympathetically into the ex- 
periences of one side and not that of both at the same 
time, the experience is partial. But no method has yet 
been found of entering into the experiences of both sides 
at once. 
As a matter of fact, if the reconstruction of the actual 
experience of the participants in the action is to be vera- 
cious, then it must be partial. The incomplete vision dis- 
torted by perspective, the sympathies for the one side and 
the antipathies for the other were just as much realities of 
the period as the objective action. Their revelation must be 
as adequate in the reconstructed experience or it will not 
accurately reproduce the original conditions. 
The preventive of exaggerated and intolerant nationalism 
which might result from a disproportionate amount of 
sympathetic experience upon the one side is not at bottom 
to look with cold, impersonal scientific eye upon the nations; 
but rather at different times to relive the experiences as 
presented from both points of view. That is to say, let stu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
    138 THE CURRICULUM 
dents relive the experiences of the Revolutionary War as 
accurately presented from the British point of view; im- 
aginatively traveling and associating with the British armies 
and unconsciously taking on its valuations and aspirations 
and seeing everything from its side. This was just as much 
a part of the actual experience of the times. Let the student | 
read the history of the Mexican War as a shadow-member of 
the army of Santa Ana, and thus see the war through 
Mexican eyes. This is just as true a view of it as the one 
from the American side. 
Not only can a sound nationalism be developed experi- 
entially, but also the corrective to exaggeration can be ex- 
perientially developed. And in the two processes the expe- 
riential foundation is laid for a tolerant social consciousness 
that is wider than the national; and which can look equally 
and impersonally upon all sides. 
Let the program of conflict, however, be no narrow one of 
military wars alone. Let there be far fuller experience on the 
part of youth in the Nation’s economic struggle for the 
world’s markets. This is going on at the present time. It has 
been going on these hundred years or more. Let youth read 
a spirited history of our American merchant marine; of the 
contest we have made in the markets of South America, 
China, Russia, Australia, the Philippines, etc.; and of our 
struggle to keep our home markets for our home producers 
as against foreign competition. Let the present aspects of 
this economic struggle be made to stand out clear by giving 
full space to the last decade or two. Naturally the student’s 
participative experience in this economic struggle must come 
later in the course than the military struggles. 
The corrective to vision so as to prevent distorted social 
perspective is to read also vivid accounts of British com- 
merce from their point of view; of French commerce from 
their angle of vision; of Japanese commerce, etc.
-P-A-G-E-147
LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 139 
A still larger program of experience should relate to the 
large-group conflict involved in its control of powerful in- 
ternal interests: railroad corporations, manufacturing, 
mining, and commercial organizations, financial classes, 
capitalist and labor groups, political spoilsmen, ete. Stu- 
dents, perhaps on the high-school level, need to read, for 
example, the history of railroad regulation. This should 
reveal the self-seeking character in the past of those power- 
ful organizations. It should present an extended story of 
the concrete ways in which they have tried, often success- 
fully, to over-reach the public; and of the fight made by the 
public by way of resisting such powerful predatory attacks. 
Like all the rest, this, too, should be no dull sociological 
chronology and analysis, but a living reconstruction of 
spirited group-conflict. And it needs to be seen with the 
perspective of the large-group point of view. The purpose 
being the development of the wider community conscious- 
ness as opposed to that of the specialized group, this wider 
consciousness that made the fight originally must be re- 
constructed and reéxperienced in the youthful fighter. He 
will be thereby shaped for that continuing general commu- 
nity consciousness that must continue the fight in whatever 
form it may nowadays arise. Having thus fought the rail- 
roads in the past, he thus takes on the racial experience, so 
to speak, in the community handling of them. 
“But the railroads perform indispensable services; and 
they have rights proportioned to those services,” one says. 
“Therefore these matters should not be seen from just one 
side.” This is all very true. And in chapter X we presented 
a part of the plan of training men to do full justice; namely, 
reading a sympathetic presentation of the history of rail- 
road development and labors written from their point of 
view. Each type of account is then a corrective for the 
special perspective of the other. In either case the student 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 THE CURRICULUM 
is called upon to take sides. But not to take a side is not to 
enter the action; and therefore not to have experience — 
neither large-group nor small-group. To attain the large- 
group attitudes and valuations and understanding, he must 
fight the large-group battle, from its point of view; and stren- 
uously. But to correct the distortion of perspective, he must 
at another time, in this vicarious way, also fight the small- 
group battle against the large-group; and with the same vigor 
and single-mindedness. The two sides are to be known, not 
by sitting on the fence and disinterestedly observing both, 
but by plunging in, first on one side and then on the other, 
and learning each side by experiencing it. 
The problem is closely analogous to that of visual per- 
spective. As one looks out on the landscape his image is a 
distortion. He sees near things large and clear and solid; 
and far things small and dim and unreal. The corrective 
is change of position. Let him go to the far things and re- 
new his observations. He sees the things reversed. Observ- 
ing from both points of view he arrives at true valuations as 
to all the things. An omniscient eye might see all things 
truly and without distortion from a single point of view. But 
human eyes cannot. Man’s view is always partial view, to 
be corrected by change in the position from which he makes 
observation. We do not say a painting is untrue because it 
involves the visual illusion of perspective. Quite the reverse, 
it is untrue when it neglects perspective. 
In arguing that the partiality of actual experience shall ex- 
ist in reconstructed educational experience, the ends in view 
are justice and fairness and the balanced judgment. We 
are to recognize that we are dealing with two forms of bias, 
both inherently necessary, the maleficent results of which 
are to be avoided by developing both in the same minds 
in ways that permit each to correct the other. The experi- 
ence also lays the foundation of concreteness needed for the
-P-A-G-E-149
  LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 141 
problem-solving and scientific generalizations that involve 
seeing all sides clearly and impartially. Only those who 
have experienced all sides are provided with the materials 
necessary for sound generalizations. This alone can bring 
them into vital contacts with essential realities without 
which problem-solving is impossible and generalizations but 
empty verbalities. It gives them the substance and mate- 
rials of thought before they are called upon to think. 
Finally, there is another inspiring type of national con- 
flict, namely, the ceaseless and ever-strenuous warfare with 
the hostile or reluctant forces of Nature. This is a battle 
that takes place mainly through the specialized activities of 
occupational groups. But the national story can be written 
so as to show these specialized groups as arms of the large 
group. Many things also have been undertaken in a na- 
tional way: lighthouse and life-saving service, national 
forest service, the weather bureau, quarantine and health 
service, the flood control, river navigation, the fight upon 
noxious insects, etc. Let students read the full story of these 
important national undertakings, and they are further ex- 
perienced in taking the national point of view. And the 
greater the width and intensity of this experience, the more 
intense becomes their national-group consciousness. 
Large-group municipal consciousness 
In one’s city, for example, the good citizen is one who 
habitually looks to the general municipal good. He has a 
municipal consciousness, so to speak, instead of a special 
partisan one. 
Now, education must use the same general formula for de- 
veloping this type of mind. Participative experience must 
be the basis of it all. Youth must act as a member of the 
large municipal group. As he sees its ends from the large- 
group point of view, and helps in the fight against the oppos-
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 THE CURRICULUM 
ing forces, he takes on the large-group consciousness and 
understanding. 
Our first question must naturally relate to the things that 
a well-trained adult generation is supposed to be doing in 
its municipal civic capacity. Youth’s best civic education 
then must come from participation along with adults in these 
activities. In the following unclassified list we have pre- 
sented a few of the matters for which the entire body of 
citizens, old and young, adult and adolescent, are respon- 
sible: — 
1. Keeping the city clean. 
2. Making the city sanitary. 
8. Making the city beautiful. 
4. Care of the city’s trees, shrubbery, and grass-plots. 
6. Preventing the smoke evil. 
6. Prevention of flies and mosquitoes. 
7, Destruction of tree- and plant-destroying insects. 
8. Care of insect-destroying birds. 
9. Disposal of sewage, ashes, rubbish, etc. 
10. Providing a clean and pure water-supply. 
11. Providing suitable paving for all streets and alleys. 
12. Cleaning and lighting all streets and alleys. 
18. Providing for safe and rapid transportation about the city. 
14. Regulating street traffic. 
15. Providing play-opportunities for the children. 
16. Providing adult recreational facilities. 
17. Providing and maintaining a school plant. 
18. Educating the children. 
19. Providing for a sanitary milk-supply. 
20. Seeing that all food production and distribution is sanitary. 
21. Protecting the city from fire. 
22. Protecting life and property. 
23. Care of the incapacitated. 
24. Regulation for the public weal of all public utility corpora- 
tions, markets, factories, stores, trades, amusements agen- 
cies, ete. 
25. Getting these and all other like codperative activities aon 
at a proper cost.
-P-A-G-E-151
  LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 143 
26. Securing from each a proper character of service. 
27. Currently inspecting the conditions of each type of service. 
28. Currently inspecting the results obtained. 
29. Currently seeing that justice is done each specialized group: 
that it is supplied with all its needs, — not more and not less. 
30. Current inspection of municipal or general community needs 
— so as to keep service always adjusted to actual needs. 
The list is not exhaustive. It intends only to present types 
of codperative tasks that the civic community is, or ought 
to be, currently performing. Some of the tasks are performed 
by all citizens. Some are delegated to specialized individuals 
and groups, the citizen’s current duty being to supervise 
the labors; to make and to keep them effective. In some of 
the cases the citizen performs part, and he delegates part. 
But whether he directly performs the functions or dele- 
gates them, he has his community inspectorial function to 
perform. It must be confessed that the technique of the 
citizen’s civic functions has not yet been well developed. 
Citizens are actually doing all of the things mentioned; but 
often doing them badly, because they have never been taught 
or practiced in better ways. Much we hear nowadays con- 
cerning the technical inefficiency of workmen; but the 
technical inefficiency of the citizen in the performance of his 
civic functions is immeasurably greater. The workman 
knows what he is after, and has a good deal of technical 
knowledge as to what to do, even though but rule-of-thumb. 
But as a citizen, his ideas are very vague as to what he is 
after; and technical knowledge as to what constitutes effi- 
cient civic service and as to methods of holding his fellow 
citizens and their agents responsible for efficient performance 
is very small indeed. 
Youth and adulthood need to act together in the per- 
formance of these functions — for the secure training of 
youth. But the problem is greatly complicated for educa-
-P-A-G-E-152
ee hie Sea mene B8 Sai 
144 THE CURRICULUM | 
tion by the fact that adulthood is almost as much in need 
of training as youth itself. Part-time activity is a super- 
lative training device in the occupational world; we need an 
exactly analogous training method, in the larger civic field. 
. But when we look about to find men acting together con- 
sciously in performing their codperative activities effectively 
in ways in which youth may be permitted to mingle, except 
for an occasional voting to-day, it is difficult to locate any- 
thing but haphazard and miscellany. Men seem to have 
got the impression, and women, too, that the primitive art 
of voting unintelligently is the major function of the citizen. 
Naturally it is not advisable to organize part-time activity 
in voting unintelligently. 
The National Education Association Committee on the 
Teaching of Community Civics expresses clearly the need 
| of participative or part-time civic activity on the part of 
youth. The committee writes: — 
The pupil as a young citizen is a real factor in community af- 
fairs. His codperation in many phases of community life is quite 
as important as that of the adult. He may help in forming public 
opinion, not only among his mates, but in the home and in the 
community at large. 
Therefore it is a task of the teacher to cultivate in the pupil a 
sense of his responsibility, present as well as future. 
Tf a citizen has an interest in civic matters and a sense of his 
personal responsibility, he will want to act. 
Therefore the teacher must help the pupil to express his con- 
victions in word and deed. He must be given an opportunity, as 
far as possible, to live his civics both in the school and in the com- 
munity outside. 
It will be necessary for school people among others to 
take the lead in developing the technique and the practice 
of civic performance in our cities and other local commu- 
nities. Just as it has been our educational institutions that 
have taken the lead in improving both the theory and the
-P-A-G-E-153
  LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 145 
practice of agriculture and of many other occupations, so 
must they also point, and in practice show, the way to civic 
effectiveness. It is needed for the education of all the peo- 
ple, adolescent and adult. 
To begin with, citizens of a given city must know what 
they need. Do they need street paving that is twenty, forty, 
or sixty feet wide? Or do they need one width in one portion 
of the city and another width in another portion? And if 
so, what widths, and where? Do they need one thousand 
candle-power to the mile of street-lighting? or five thousand? 
or twenty thousand? Should the city water system supply a 
daily twenty-five gallons per capita? Or should it be one 
hundred gallons, or three hundred gallons? In the play- 
grounds furnished their children, should there be twenty 
square feet per child, or fifty, or one hundred? In the city 
health service, do they need twenty-five cents’ worth each 
year per capita, or a dollar’s worth, or five dollars’ worth? 
In the maintenance of the fire department or the police 
department, do they need the services of one man for each 
five hundred people? or one for each one thousand, two 
thousand, or five thousand people? If a large number is 
needed, what are the reasons? If a small number, why is 
the city so fortunate? Does the city need one high-school 
teacher for each fifteen pupils, or each twenty-five, or each 
thirty-five? How many food inspectors does the city need 
per thousand places that require inspection? How many 
school medical examiners and school nurses per thousand 
pupils? For an effective performance of civic inspectorial 
functions how many civic centers are needed for each ten 
thousand population, and how many hours of regularly 
scheduled community meetings are desirable? In the mat- 
ter of public hospital facilities, does the city need one bed 
per five hundred population? Or should it be one for each 
thousand, or twenty-five hundred? A city cannot perform

any civic function effectively and economically until it 
knows what it needs, — and in definite terms. | 
Is it possible to find out what people need in these and all 
the other things? It is easily possible to arrive at approx- 
imations that can serve until more accurate standards are 
available. Take the matter of the water-supply. The ac- 
companying table shows the number of gallons per capita 
used daily in a number of large cities in 1912.

There is nothing for beginning this type of study that 
is quite comparable in value to an array of facts. The table 
does not show conclusively just the amount of water-supply 
needed. But it gives one a few ideas to start with. All of  
-P-A-G-E-155
LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 147 
these cities are reasonably clean and sanitary —on the 
basis of 1912 standards. But it will be noticed that New York 
does as well on a hundred gallons per capita as Philadelphia 
on two hundred, or Buffalo on three hundred. When one 
notes that New York’s figures are corroborated by those of 
other large cities like Cleveland and St. Louis, it appears 
at least probable that a hundred gallons per capita is enough 
to meet human needs in large American cities, and that there 
was large waste in the four cities at the top of the list. 
After a city has determined the amounts of things needed, 
the next question for the learning citizen, adult or adoles- 
cent, is: What price should be paid? 
To take a specific case from another field, What price per 
thousand cubic feet should be paid for illuminating and 
fuel gas in our cities? The following table presents one type 
of facts needed: —

  A civie group, juvenile or adult, with such a table before 
them, will probably conclude that there is something that 
needs looking into. Conditions in different cities are differ- 
ent, and costs should be correspondingly different; but it is 
highly improbable that conditions demand such variety of 
prices as here exhibited. If Detroit is properly supplied, 
and the price just, at fifty cents, why must Buffalo pay 
twice as much? If sixty cents is correct for a city some- 
what remote from the coal-supply like Milwaukee, why 
must a city in the coal region like Reading pay almost twice 
as much? 
With such a table as a starting-point, those studying the 
problem in each city will get such facts as the following for 
their own city, and for each of the other cities that are 
used for comparison: — 
‘ 1, The amount of investment in the plant per unit of gas de- 
livered. 
2. Interest, dividends, and taxes, paid per unit of output. 
8. Cost of maintenance of the plant per unit of output. 
4, Cost of operation per unit. 
5. 
6 
i   . Percentage of cost returned from the by-products. 
. Price made to the large consumers. 
. Price made to the small consumers. 
Some inkling can now be had of our meaning when we 
; said that educational people need to lead in the performance 
of civic functions. In a representative democracy-like ours 
the major function of the people as citizens is the per- 
formance of the inspectorial function. Most of their codp- 
erative labors they will delegate to specialized employees. 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 149 
But they can never delegate to anybody the function of ex- 
amining the labors thus performed for them and pronounc- 
ing final judgment as to whether satisfactory. This they 
must do for themselves. But generally they have not the 
facts. They do not know where or how to get them. And 
not knowing the need of facts as the basis of all government, 
they have not even asked for them; and do not yet greatly 
appreciate their values, even when set before them. One 
never knows the value of a thing till he has tried it. 
Citizens need. to have such arrays of facts set before them 
in civic meetings, in bulletins, and in the public press. 
Their agents who are responsible for the labors need thus 
to render accounts of their stewardship. However presented 
the matters need to be taken up in civic meetings for 
discussion, comparison, explanation, justification, etc. Out 
of such discussion, clarified and enlightened public opinion 
grows; and this it is that lies at the basis of all effective 
performance of the inspectorial function. 
Adults at present are not much more capable of dis- 
cussing many of these matters than the young people in 
grammar grades and high school. They have less leisure for 
the purpose. And they lack the trained and paid intellectual 
and social leadership that is supplied the young people in 
their teachers. But adults are just as much in need of sys- 
tem, organization, and leadership for their thinking. Until 
society has evolved a profession of inspectorial leadership, 
—now in the making, as revealed in our bureaus of muni- 
cipal research, etc., — this task falls naturally to the two 
professions of education and journalism. And in large part 
at least, perhaps chiefly, it must always remain with them. 
Now, in ways which we shall explain more fully as we pro- 
ceed, it is possible for teachers to interest the young people 
in these civic problems; to use them as fact-gatherers and 
fact-organizers for the total community; and to have them 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  150 THE CURRICULUM | 
present the facts in the community meetings made up of 
both adults and young people. These students can search the 
reports of their own and other cities and draw up the tables 
of comparative and other facts. They can prepare charts, 
maps, diagrams, exhibits, etc., that will reveal a wide range 
of well-organized facts for the topic under discussion. They 
can make systematic surveys of their own town by way of 
bringing a wealth of concrete facts to the discussion. They 
can make surveys of sanitary conditions, street-cleaning, 
street-paving, garbage disposal, breeding-places of flies, the 
city’s trees, billboards, smoke, fire protection, distribu- 
tion of police over the city, distribution of public recreational 
opportunities, the milk-supply, water-supply, etc. 
In connection with such surveys no finer practical task 
can be devised than the making of survey maps — each one 
carrying its information and its lesson to the public-spirited 
citizen. They can make health maps, recreation maps, 
street-paving maps, street-cleaning maps, street-lighting 
maps, crime maps, tree maps, maps showing breeding-places 
of flies and mosquitoes, ete. Along with the map-making 
they can make exhibits, models, diagrams, pictures, statis- 
tical charts, etc. 
They can do it all for the practical purpose of rightly 
forming and influencing public opinion on the basis of ob- 
jective evidence. This is the most fundamental and prac- 
tical civic task involved in the citizen’s major function of 
inspectorial supervision. In doing this the young people 
are engaged in civic part-time work. They are dealing with 
actual things. The motivation is not make-believe. It is 
that of real life. They are bearing responsibility for actual 
labors that they can see need to be performed. They are 
working in conjunction with adults, under their leader- 
ship and direction. It is real work. It is not play-civics of 
the mock-court, mock-congress type. The motives are the
-P-A-G-E-159
  LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 151 
same as those that control adults — in the fact-gathering, 
the fact-presentation, and in the judgments arrived at. 
But the facts are inaccessible? Often they are; specialized 
groups like to keep them hidden because they know the 
bludgeoning power of facts when applied to the inspec- 
torial supervision of themselves. But at the present time 
there are huge quantities of accessible facts that are not being 
utilized. But they lack significance, we are then told, unless 
we have similar facts from other cities for tables of compari- 
son. And they say that while school people may get the 
facts relative to their own city, they cannot secure them 
from other cities. The objection is but the voice of inertia. 
Let a wide-awake body of teachers in each of fifty cities 
gather pertinent facts for their own city. Let them send 
these facts to each of the other forty-nine cities. Then all 
will have the facts for the fifty cities. Most of the actual work 
of collecting the facts can be performed by the students 
themselves. They can do the sending, the receiving, and 
draw up the comparative tables. Better educational ex- 
perience for them cannot be devised. It is a continuing task 
to be done year after year. 
Civie training in the schools can be healthy and virile 
only as it involves the things that are being striven for by 
the community. It must be an organic part of the total 
civic striving of the community. In proportion as the school 
isolates itself from the community and finds mere textbook 
matters of study that are in no wise related to the condi- 
tions within the city, the school work drifts from its proper 
moorings and loses its educational effectiveness. 
In addition to the ways mentioned, another method of 
keeping the school civic work grounded in reality is to make 
the schools, as fully as possible, the civic forums of the city 
— especially the high school. For example, when the topic 
of street-paving is being considered in the high-school civics

class, the chairman of the committee of the city council 
which has charge of this particular work, the commissioner 
of streets, or the chief of the bureau of public works, should 
be invited to discuss the situation before the high school. 
When the subject of taxes is taken up, the chairman of the 
finance committee of the city council, the tax collector, or 
the chairman of the finance committee of the school board, 
should be invited to discuss the problems of taxation. 
When the topic is community sanitation, then it is the board 
of health and its inspectors who have an opportunity of dis- 
seminating the necessary sanitary information. Nearly 
all civic functions are delegated. The man to whom any 
function is delegated is the one who should feel responsible 
for keeping the public enlightened as to his work. It is nec- 
essary for his own effectiveness, and for the success of his 
labors in the community. 
This plan is incomplete if the report is to be made only 
to the high-school students. The information that these 
men have should be for the whole community. Yet here 
within the school we have segregated only the children and 
youth of the community. Those to whom the information 
should primarily be given, namely, the adult leaders of 
the community, are not present. The officials are report- 
ing, not to the men who hold them responsible, but only 
to the children; and in a comparatively artificial situation. 
They cannot talk to the youth of the city in normal fashion 
if they are talking only to youth in isolation. They can talk 
normally only as they are addressing the adult leaders of 
the city, their peers, those to whom they owe their respon- 
sibility. The children can then hear and learn in normal 
fashion. Youth must learn in large measure, not from being 
addressed directly, but from listening to adulthood talking 
to adulthood. It is for youth one of the normal modes of 
participation in adult affairs. 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 153 
It may be objected that youth has a right to its own life 
at this age, and ought not to be caught up in the wheels of 
serious adult responsibilities; that it has a right to a long 
season of rosy-hued irresponsibility before being condemned 
to these things that belong to the somber gray of the adult 
world. In reply, let us say that it is in mingling in the full 
life of the world as made up of childhood, youth, maturity, 
and old age, in which youth finds its fullest and best life. 
They have not only the right, but the duty, of play of an 
abundant and varied character. This we emphasize fully 
in other portions of our discussion. But youthful partici- 
pation in adult activities from infancy onward is really one 
of the most satisfying and most beneficent forms of play. 
They do not give up life in having something in it besides 
the purposeless. Rather do they find it. 
Other concrete civic activities 
The chief part-time civic work of youth will be participa- 
tion i in inspectorial activities; because this is also the adult’s 
major civic activity. But there are certain other community 
activities not yet placed entirely in specialized hands. And 
of those so specialized, there are certain ones in which 
youthful participation is possible. 
Children can aid in tree-planting and in tree-care — an 
extension of the Arbor-Day spirit to three hundred and sixty- 
five days in the year. They can study intensively the kinds 
of trees and shrubbery best suited to the city’s needs and 
conditions in its various portions — modes of securing them, 
of planting them, and of protecting them from drought, 
insects, and other enemies. They can be organized to carry 
out the various steps of the labor in both the Se and 
the year-long protection. 
“Clean-up week,” like Arbor Day, is being institution- 
alized for the training of children. While this annual spring

renovation is an excellent civic opportunity and should be 
vigorously carried on, even better training comes from year- 
long interest and attention to the need, by way of prevent- 
ing a goodly portion of the accumulated rubbish. 
As conditions change, as work becomes specialized, and 
as groups grow large, this “community chore-service”’ is 
coming to take the place of a portion, at least, of the family 
chore-service performed by children in past generations. In 
our professional literature nowadays we read of a consider- 
able variety of possible community activities: — SD

By way of showing the practical man’s attitude toward

LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 155 
this problem we quote the following words from an editorial 
in one of our metropolitan newspapers, entitled “Citizen- 
ship and the Schools”: — 
The public school has been less effective than it might and 
should have been. It has laid most of its emphasis on information, 
little or none on will and moral relations. In short, the public 
school needs drastic modernization to make it a practical and effi- 
cient instrument of at least rudimentary good citizenship. .. . It 
must take upon its broad shoulders a large burden. It must make 
itself rather a civic gymnasium, a social drill-yard for soldiers of peace 
who march forward. 
These civic labors of youth, like the inspectorial ones 
previously mentioned, must not be things detached and 
isolated from the life of the general community. The chil- 
dren must see and feel their labors to be but a delegated 
part of a serious community responsibility of which the 
adults are carrying the major portion of the load. Other- 
wise their efforts will be but irresponsible make-believe; and 
soon degenerate or disappear. If the civic responsibilities 
are such that they are conceived to rest only upon children, 
then they rest upon nobody; since they are not real com- 
munity responsibilities. 
But this is only local participation by way of developing 
municipal-mindedness. Can the plan be extended for train- 
ing purposes to practical state and national service? Under 
present conditions of war it is being done: both by those 
students who have entered active military, naval, aerial, 
Red Cross, or other service; and by those at home who are 
striving along with adults to augment production and te 
facilitate just and economical distribution and consumption. 
The consciousness of solidarity and the spirit of service 
thereby engendered is one our Nation cannot afford to lose 
in time of peace. It can be kept, however, only if there is 
actual and genuine and necessary service to be rendered. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
    156 THE CURRICULUM 
Make-believe service will not accomplish the purposes. The 
largest field of active peace-time service is that of the 
specialized occupations. As industries grow, this service 
tends more and more to be national. A major social problem 
is not to make it service, —it is already that, — but to 
make it seen as service. The educational problem here is 
largely so to train occupationally that the workers can 
realize the social implications and relations of their labors; 
so that they will see their peace-service to the nation on a 
plane no less high than their war-service to the same nation. 
Professor James was of the opinion that this should be 
prepared for by some years of general occupational service 
He writes:!— 
If now — and this is my idea — there were, instead of military 
conscription, a conscription of the whole youthful population to 
form for a certain number of years a part of the army enlisted 
against Nature, injustice would tend to be evened up, and numer- 
ous benefits to the commonwealth would follow. The military 
ideals of hardihood and discipline would be wrought into the 
growing fiber of the people; no one would remain blind, as the 
luxurious classes now are blind, to man’s real relations to the globe 
he lives on, and to the permanently solid and hard foundations of 
his higher life. To coal- and iron-mines, to freight-trains, to fishing- 
fleets in December, to dish-washing, clothes-washing, and window- 
washing, to road-building and tunnel-making, to foundries and 
stoke-holes, and to the frames of sky-scrapers, would our gilded 
youths be drafted off, according to their choice, to get the child- 
ishness knocked out of them, and to come back into society with 
healthier sympathies and soberer ideas. They would have paid 
their blood-tax, done their part in the immemorial human warfare 
against Nature; they would tread the earth more proudly; the 
women would value them more highly; they would be better 
fathers and teachers of the following generation. 
Such a conscription, with the state of public opinion that would 
have required it, and the moral fruits it would bear, would pre-

serve in the midst of a pacific civilization the manly virtues which 
the military party is so afraid of seeing disappear in peace. We 
should get toughness without callousness, authority with as little 
cruelty as possible, and painful work done cheerily because the 
duty is temporary. .. . I spoke of the “moral equivalent” of war. 
So far, war has been the only force that can discipline a whole 
community, and, until an equivalent discipline is organized, I 
believe that war must have its way. But I have no serious doubt 
that the ordinary prides and shames of social man, once developed 
to a certain intensity, are capable of organizing such a moral equiv- 
alent as I have sketched, or some other just as effective for pre- 
serving manliness of type. Though an infinitely remote Utopia 
just now, in the end it is but a question of time, of skillful propa- 
gandism and of opinion-making men seizing historic opportuni- 
ties. 
Whether any of the features of this proposal are practi- 
cable or not, it reveals a real educational problem of large 
proportions and complexity. Upon our profession rests 
responsibility for proposing and effecting a practicable 
solution. 
The international situation 
Thus far we have discussed local and national civic prob- 
lems. In the knitting-up of the world’s social fabric polit- 
ically, the national group is practically the ultimate group. 
In the world of productive industry, however, whether 
agriculture, manufacture, mining, or other, it is clear that 
the peoples of the world are interdependent; that on the 
side of production we are really a world-community, each 
region producing for all. When this is the case, naturally 
in the distribution and consumption of commodities we are 
a world-community. Whatever the political situation may 
be, it is clear that we have already largely achieved economic 
cosmopolitanism. On the side of art also we are a world- 
community; and also in the fields of literature, and science, 
and technology, and invention, etc.
-P-A-G-E-166
158 THE CURRICULUM 
But in our social-group or political consciousness, we have 
— until the last few years — scarcely even looked beyond 
the boundaries of nationalism. To look upon other peoples 
as members of a world-family, to look with friendly eye 
upon other nations as equal neighbors having rights similar 
to and equal to our own, even to contemplate common 
action with such neighbors in the codperative promotion of 
world-welfare, — such attitudes we had felt to border dan- 
gerously upon mild treason to our country. Politically we 
have been essentially parochial-minded. 
The present World-War is revealing the interdependen- 
cies of peoples. We now see that no nation can live to itself. 
We are coming to realize that just as the States of our Union 
form one national family, each of which is necessary to the 
highest welfare of all, so the various countries of the world 
are members of a planetary family and each necessary to 
the highest welfare of the others.) We see that nations have 
rights equal to our own; that nations have duties also to the 
others that are proportioned to their rights. It has been 
demonstrated that unbridled nationalism is a peril to the 
world. In our previous discussion we have tried to show the 
inevitability of the ethics of aggression as a component part 
of the nationalistic consciousness. In proportion as nation- 
alism is strong, the dual standard of social conduct arises. 
In such case the nation sees its own rights large and sees 
its duties small. In mind and heart, in ambition and in 
action, such a nation becomes parasitic upon the rest. 
When not held in check by a cosmopolitan consciousness, 
such a nation, if it feels strong enough, goes ruthlessly 
abroad to rob and plunder the others. Of this we have 
sufficient practical demonstration. In the present World- 
War we are but reaping the natural and inevitable fruits of 
exaggerated nationalism. 
_ We are not here condemning nationalism. We have al-
-P-A-G-E-167

LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS ss So 
ready said that the large-group consciousness exists upon 
different levels. A wide and generous municipal conscious- 
ness is the cure for the evils that result from the petty 
consciousness of self-interested small-groups within the city. 
A county or congressional district or state consciousness 
that looks to the welfare of the total group specified is that 
which for that region eliminates the parasitism and other 
evils resulting from the small-group consciousness. Rising 
to the next level, it is then a broad, generous, and vitalized 
national consciousness which alone can provide a spirit of 
mutual service on the part of all of the constituent portions 
of the nation. Within the nation this national conscious- 
ness is in all respects most beneficent. Without it the nation 
disintegrates into internal warring and parasitic groups, 
bringing all the evils of social chaos in their train. Because 
of its intra-national aspect, we must emphasize the fullest 
practicable development of the national consciousness. 
In insisting that we also develop an international con- 
sciousness we are but arriving at the next and inevitable 
logical step of the same argument. The national conscious- 
ness at the present time needs to be huge in order to take 
care of the difficult intra-national problems; but if it is not 
tempered by a large-group consciousness that takes in all 
of the rest of the world, the extra-national attitudes thereby 
developed threaten the rest of the nations; and in reaction, 
the nation itself. The cosmopolitan consciousness alone 
can bring about that wise codperation of the various na- 
tions of the earth for the more adequate promotion of the 
general world welfare. Just a ignalism will temper the 
spirit of strife thatsteds fo arise within the nation, so will 
internationalisin temper fhe analogous spirit of strife that 
tends to arise among the members of the planetary group. 
} We are not here referring to an international political 
organization. That has not yet come into being. If it ever 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 THE CURRICULUM 
arrives, it will grow out of a widely diffused cosmopolitan 
consciousness. This is prerequisite to, and must precede, 
any organization. Our educational problem relates only to 
the development of this cosmopolitan consciousness. The 
state papers of our President have recently breathed the 
spirit of this high consciousness which is rapidly transfusing 
the minds of all peoples. 
Turning now to the educational problem, How are we to 
develop this cosmopolitan consciousness? We have already 
referred to the place of action, observation, participation 
with a group, as a mode of developing an understanding of 
that group and sympathies with its purposes and its labors, 
We referred to the large place of reading for the sake of 
vicarious action in the case of the large groups. What is 
true of reading in the case of the nationalistic spirit is even 
more true of reading in the development of the cosmopolitan 
spirit. There is needed for the world as a whole, and of the 
separate nations that make it up, readings that will permit 
children and youth sympathetically to enter into the actions 
of men in the various regions of the earth. Let one in his 
reading live imaginatively with a nation for a sufficient 
length of time and he will come to feel himself one with it, 
in much the same way as though he dwelt among them for 
a time. 
The readings for the purpose will be history, biography, 
travels, geography, and literature. With any of these the 
primary aim will be the reconstruction of life within the 
various lands; so that the reader can relive it. In proportion 
as it is vivid and stirring so that the reader can become 
warmed, can lose himself to actual time and place, can 
become enveloped in the action of which he reads, it will be 
effective for the purpose. 
The ends in view demand catholicity in the choice of the 
readings. Schools need to gather of each type readings that
-P-A-G-E-169
  
  LARGE-GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS 161 
reveal all important present-day nations and peoples; 
Canada, America, Mexico, Central America, West Indies, 
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, 
China, India, Turkey, Russia, the Balkans, the Central 
Empires, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, France, Belgium, Neth- 
erlands, Scandinavia, England, Ireland, Scotland, North 
Africa, Egypt, Central Africa, and South Africa; at least 
these. This is to choose the history of grammar grades 
and high schools on a basis that has not hitherto been em- 
ployed; and the literature; and the biography. This basis 
has been employed, however, in the case of geography which 
actually does reveal in some degree all of the nations of the 
earth. The principle that is applicable to geography appears 
to be equally applicable to history and literature. 
Another type of social reading belongs, then, on the later 
levels of education. After developing understanding and 
sympathetic attitudes toward the various individual na- 
tions, students are prepared to read, not the particular his- 
tories of nations, but world-history: that which looks in a 
unitary way to the entire world-situation. Thus the student 
will read the history of world-commerce; history of world- 
industry; history of transportation; history of agriculture; 
history of political institutions; history of finance; sanita- 
tion; recreational activities; municipal government; etc. In 
each case the history of the last decade or two should 
probably be as voluminous as that of all of the previous cen- 
turies combined. This will then introduce all of the needed 
geographical and economic elements. Through problem- 
solying, discussions, etc., students can be brought to an 
understanding of the general principles involved. 
The thing demanded is not a new program. It is rather a 
definition of social purposes on the basis of which present 
programs can be rectified and further developed. As a 
matter of fact, in our supplementary readings, especially in 
the elementary school, we are tending more and more to 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 THE CURRICULUM 
give width of world-understanding both historical and 
geographical. High schools and colleges of liberal arts have 
been more enmeshed in tradition, and in the task of training 
specialists. On the levels, therefore, where most of this 
training should be accomplished, it has scarcely been begun. 
But in their recent inclusions of industrial history, commer- 
cial history, industrial and commercial geography, history 
of civilization, a fuller emphasis upon modern problems, etc., 
we discern the ferment at work upon these levels also. 
“The program is impossibly large,” it is objected. “An 
impossible task cannot be the right solution.”” The objection 
shows the need of referring to the methods to be employed. 
It will be noted we have nowhere said that these histories 
are to be learned. We have only said that students need 
experiences of certain kinds; and that these experiences are 
to be had in part by reading vivid historical accounts. The 
history of a nation is to be read rapidly. This is necessary 
for warming the personality and making one for the time a 
member of the group. If a four-hundred-page book is not 
devoured in ten or fifteen days the experience is likely to be 
anemic and relatively ineffective. If the experience is vivid 
and stirring, it will leave its normal residues in memory. 
It must be kept in mind in considering methods that 
knowledge is not the most fundamental thing aimed at; but 
rather social attitudes and valuations. For these, it is living 
experience, not memorizing experience, that is the all- 
important thing. And even in the matter of knowledge it is 
not a remembrance of specific facts that is desired; but 
rather a knowledge of general social principles. Let the 
reading experience be of the type suggested, and the proper 
materials are provided for problem-solving and generaliza- 
tion. Right accomplishment of these latter requires not 
merely batches of pale facts, but all the emotionalized 
attitudes and valuations that can arise only out of emotion« 
alized experience. —
-P-A-G-E-171
CHAPTER XIII 
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 
Morat education has always been and must always be 
looked upon as fundamental in the training of youth. In 
our schools we have attempted it through direct and indi- 
rect methods; in our churches through direct teaching, per- 
suasion, and the fear-motive. It is probable that most 
actual training has been accomplished within the Great 
School of practical social action and reaction. 
Those who live as members of the small social group, and 
from year’s end to year’s end breathe its social atmosphere; 
naturally and inevitably take on its attitudes, valuations, 
and dual standard of ethics. Direct ethical instruction by 
school or church seems relatively ineffectual in the face of 
these powerful experiential influences. On the other hand, 
those who grow up in vital contact, direct and indirect, with 
the large social group, and who breathe its humanizing 
atmosphere, naturally and inevitably take on the large- 
group attitudes, valuations, and tendencies to social reac- 
tion. In such case, church and school may well reinforce 
the process by giving supplementary training. Their efforts 
are likely to be efficacious, however, not in proportion to 
their direct teaching or persuasion, but rather in proportion 
as they are actually able to provide the conditions of large- 
group living experience. 
A frequent conception of moral training is well expressed 
in the report of the National Council Committee on Moral 
Education: — 
If we would have strong and beautiful characters in adult life, 
certain elemental virtues must be inculcated in childhood and 
youth. These the teachers should have as definitely in mind as  
-P-A-G-E-172
  
  164 THE CURRICULUM 
they do the nouns and verbs in grammar or fractions in arithme- 
tic. They must know, not only what virtues they would implant, 
but how they would develop them. Among these elemental vir- 
tues we would include those which are generally accepted as form- 
ing the very basis of character, such as obedience, kindness, honor, 
truthfulness, cleanliness, cheerfulness, honesty, respect for sel 
and for others, helpfulness, industry, economy, power of initiative, 
justice, usefulness, patriotism, courage, self-control, prudence, 
benevolence, system, neatness, politeness, fortitude, heroism, per- 
severance, sympathy, consecration to duty, unselfishness, comrade- 
sbip, patience, temperance, hopefulness, determination, and fi- 
delity. Pupils should not only have some idea of the meaning of 
these virtues, but they should be trained in the practice of them 
until they become fixed habits. 
According to this widespread conception, the task is to 
give information concerning the abstract virtues and to 
drill the pupils in action that involves them. They are 
assumed always to be virtues. This, however, is far from 
being the case. Take, for example, perseverance. This may 
characterize the conduct of a statesman, burglar, mechanic, 
farmer, housewife, political grafter, assassin, or anybody 
else engaged in any kind of action good or bad. Clearly this 
abstract aspect of human action is not a virtue in itself. 
Quite true, where it is exercised in right directions it pro- 
duces increased human good and is then an aspect of virtu- 
ous conduct. It is equally true, however, that where it is 
exercised in wrong directions it may produce the most 
disastrous human results; and is then an aspect of vicious 
conduct. Obviously the virtue or the vice is not in the per- 
severance itself. 
It is urged that while the perseverance itself is always a 
virtue, it may be a virtue of either good or bad conduct. 
This is but a verbal quibble. Perseverance may be a char- 
acteristic of either good or bad conduct. But its character- 
izing bad conduct does not make the latter good; it only 
makes it worse. And what increases evil is evil at the time.
-P-A-G-E-173
  MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 165 
Tf, now, we look at obedience, courage, industry, loyalty, 
and most of the others, we can see that they may be 
characteristics of cmduct within any kind of social group. 
They are sometim’s characteristics of virtuous conduct; 
and sometimes of vicious. 
Obviously these so-called “virtues” are not the moral 
ultimates. They are but aspects of human conduct which 
must be judged good or bad on quite other standards. Good 
moral conduct is that which increases the total sum of 
human welfare. The more efficacious it is in producing 
beneficent results, the higher is the type of morality. It 
springs from an intelligence that discerns equally the things 
which promote human welfare and the things that are 
injurious. It is rooted in large-group sympathies, love of 
human-kind, large-group vision, attitudes, valuations, and 
tendencies to behavior. Whatever will produce and inten- 
sify large-group consciousness and expand social intelli- 
gence will develop high moral character. 
Bad moral conduct is that which increases the total sum 
of human woe. One of its basic conditions is an ignorance 
of the things required for human welfare. A second is small- 
group consciousness. Members of small groups hold to the 
dual standard of conduct. Virtuous action for them is that 
which promotes welfare of their little group through (1) the 
exercise of the social virtues toward each other, and (2) the 
exercise of the anti-social virtues toward society in general. 
Since such action tends usually to be parasitic rather than 
efficiently productive, they force others not only to carry 
their own share of the total load, but also the share that 
should be properly borne by the parasitic group. Their 
action results in social injury in the degree in which they 
are actually parasitic; and in the degree in which they em- 
ploy anti-social action in effecting their parasitism. The 
problem of education is to develop within them the large-
-P-A-G-E-174
% | 
166 THE CURRICULUM : 
group consciousness, valuations, and sympathies; and a 
clear intellectual appreciation of the fcrces and influences 
that are to be controlled in the interests of all. The problem 
of moral education is not to develop wit!,in them the various 
virtues of industry, obedience, courage, loyalty, etc. These 
exist within those possessing small-group consciousness as 
abundantly as in those having the large-group conscious- 
ness. Simply they are wrongly directed. The central train- 
ing task is a transformation of their group-consciousness. 
Quite clearly the central problem of moral education is 
identical with that of civic education. The humanizing and 
socializing training discussed in various chapters, in so far 
as it can be made to promote width of social vision, and 
breadth and intensity of social sympathies, will provide the 
taproot of morality. And there can be no substitute that 
will accomplish this training. It is not done by giving infor- 
mation about the virtues, as in ethics; not even by drilling 
in the practice of the specific virtues. It grows from deeper 
roots. And it must grow; not be grafted. 
If the foregoing statements are true, why is there so much 
insistence upon religion as the necessary sanction and sup- 
port of morality? In reply we must say that it is because 
religion is the taproot of morality. The religious vision is 
but a further widening of the large-group civic vision. The 
religious sympathies are but further widening of the social 
sympathies. We are not to stop with a mere present-day 
planetary consciousness. We are to go on to that wider 
cosmic consciousness of man as a member of a universal 
order that is not limited in time or space. It is to conceive 
one’s membership within an order that includes all things 
that are, and all beings that are. It is to see one’s self as a 
member of a social group that is not only as wide as the 
municipal or national or world-group of to-day, but which 
is also wide enough to include the members of the genera-
-P-A-G-E-175
| 
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 167 
tions that have preceded us, and those that are to come after; 
and which includes all benevolent and beneficent non- 
earthly beings so far as we can know of them or reasonably 
conceive them. Individuals differ as to many things that 
lie beyond the realm of sense; but the essentially religious- 
minded seem to agree upon the central conception as here 
stated. What social science calls interdependency, codpera- 
tion, community of origin, and group-consciousness, reli- 
gion calls the brotherhood of than. 
It is often said that our public schools cannot train for 
religious thought and springs of action. If what we are 
saying is true, the highest function of our public schools is 
the development of the social attitudes and valuations and 
knowledge that are equally central in conceptions of social 
interdependency and of human brotherhood. Naturally in 
our schools we shall hold to the terminology of social science; 
to the non-controversial and therefore fundamental portion 
of the field. This is not to attempt the whole; but it is to 
assist in laying the solid foundation for the whole; without 
which little else worth while can be done. The churches 
need such solid ground as the starting-point for the exten- 
sions that they would rear into the infinite.

Tue human organism may be conceived as a reservoir of 
energy, which is continually emptying itself through various 
channels of expenditure, and which is being continually 
refilled through other channels of inflow. The analogy is an 
old one, used by Descartes; but in the light of modern 
science there is none more exact nor more fruitful. 
The outflow of energy is through many channels, accom- 
plishing many types of result. One portion is consumed in 
the production of bodily heat; another in secretion and the 
involuntary muscular actions of respiration, digestion, cir- 
culation, etc.; a third portion is consumed in the elimination 
and neutralization of poisons generated in the system; a 
large amount, in voluntary activity; and finally, there is the 
portion that flows out through the nerve-channels under- 
lying thought and feeling and emotional excitement. The 
expenditure is unceasing; but in amount it varies according 
to conditions of temperature, of work and play, etc. One’s 
waking hours constitute mainly a season of outflow. 
The inflow of energy is through the channels of nutri- 
tion. The process is continuous, occurring at all times, but 
proceeding unequally. The chief season of inflow is during 
the hours of sleep. Without this restoration of supply, the 
level of the reservoir is rapidly lowered. 
In an individual of invariably robust health, living under 
normal conditions, the level of the reservoir is high, — in 
the neighborhood of one hundred per cent of potential. 
The daily income of energy just about equals the daily out- 
go. If he is doing light work with light expenditure, the in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  172° THE CURRICULUM 
flow will be light. If the daily expenditure is heavy, — but 
not abnormally so, — the return inflow is correspondingly 
abundant. Thus, barring accident, he may go through life 
near one hundred per cent physically efficient. His condi- 
tion in this respect may be roughly represented by A in the 
accompanying figure. w PBaVey3H0OD 
  Fic. 8. To represent different possible levels in the reservoir of one’s vitality 
Tf, however, the daily expenditure through channels of 
work, play, worry, struggle with body-poisons, mental ex- 
citement, etc., is greater than the daily income, the level 
is lowered. His energy-supply may come to be such as rep- 
resented by B or C in the figure. The level of his vitality 
may stand at seventy per cent or fifty ‘per cent of potential 
instead of at the normal one hundred per cent. The lower 
the level, the nearer he approaches the danger line. 
An equilibrium may be established at one of these lower 
levels. Daily income and daily outgo may again be equal. 
In this case, the level of vitality does not sink lower; 
neither does it rise. Such a devitalized individual may go 
through life with his vital reserves at fifty per cent of what 
they ought to be. The original causes of the lowered vitality 
may continue, physiological habits may become established, 
and the individual is held down permanently. If, however,
-P-A-G-E-181
TASK OF PHYSICAL TRAINING 173 
ke can discover and remove the original causes, and care- 
fully regulate income and expenditures, he may — usually 
slowly, if habits have been formed — raise the level of his 
reserve vitality again to something near its old level. 
Relation to vocational efficiency 
It makes a large difference whether the level of vitality 
is maintained at fifty per cent of potential, or at one hun- 
dred per cent. The vocational demand for efficiency when 
reduced to specifics is a demand for forcefulness, for ac- 
curacy, for speed, for endurance, and for consistency or 
uniformity of good work. And these are all fruits of a full 
vitality. While the nervous, under-vitalized individual may 
present a great show of energy and may in fact put forth 
large effort for a short time, he cannot be consistently force- 
ful, day after day, and month after month. He lacks re- 
siliency. When expenditure is large, it is not restored suffi- 
ciently rapidly. The daily oscillation must not be large, if he 
is to be consistent. On the other hand, the fully vitalized 
individual may make large effort and large expenditure day 
after day over long periods of time. The return surge is 
equally prompt and vigorous. Even after strenuous exer- 
tion, each new day finds the level of the reservoir at its 
previous high level. With him the daily oscillation may be 
wide. He alone is prepared for forcefulness, endurance, speed, 
and consistency of work. He also is accurate. His nerves 
are sound, his movements under secure control, his inhi- 
bitions prompt and certain. The devitalized individual is 
nervous, incodrdinated, uncertain in his movements and 
inhibitions. The range of his mental life is narrowed. He 
does not see so many things at one time, and his failure to 
observe all of the things related to his work involves him in 
mistakes and accidents. He is the type of man that indus- 
try nowadays is trying to eliminate.
-P-A-G-E-182

174 THE CURRICULUM 
There is the further need of joy in one’s work. The force- 
ful, well-poised individual does his work with ease, with con- 
fidence, with accuracy; and without taxing himself, obtains 
the results that he desires. He does not “live upon his 
nerves.” He does not drive himself to his work. He is not 
in that state of nervous irritability which makes steadiness 
and accuracy so constraining as to be maddening. 
Training for a high level of physical vitality is thus one 
of the most fundamental aspects of training for vocational 
efficiency. 
Relation to morality 
The physical condition of an individual or of a nation is 
intimately related to the moral and civic character. On the 
positive side, morality in our complicated age is rooted in 
width and clearness of vision of human affairs in community, 
nation, and world; and in permanent sympathetic attitudes 
toward all individuals and social groups; and in the dispo- 
sition so to act as to promote without mistake or accident 
the general welfare. On the negative side, morality consists 
of inhibitions which restrain tendencies to anti-social or 
other injurious conduct. 
The state of one’s vitality is intimately related to both 
the positive and negative sides. Psychologists tell us that 
when we examine a state of momentary consciousness, it 
is found to consist of two portions: the focal idea to which 
attention is being for the moment given, and which occupies 
the center of consciousness; and the marginal ideas, sensa- 
tions, etc., many in number, of which we are at the mo- 
ment aware, but to which we are not giving attention. Now 
in individuals of different degrees of vitality, the focal idea 
may be about equally clear to all. The difference is in the 
character of the marginal consciousness. In the man of 
full vitality, there is a width and richness of marginal life.
-P-A-G-E-183
TASK OF PHYSICAL TRAINING 1%5 
He holds many things in mind at once. Consequently he is 
the man of wide mental horizon, and of far vision. Since 
the subtler and more complicated social relations are those 
that involve seeing many things at once and in wide per- 
spective, he alone is in a position clearly to see and appre- 
ciate the existing social relations and demands in our 
modern society. Seeing the relations, he is in a position to 
act wisely and justly and for the best interests of all con- 
cerned. He is morally responsible. 
In the case of the semi-vitalized individual the marginal 
life is much narrowed. He holds fewer things in mind at once; 
and therefore less adequately sees the relations; especially 
the subtle complicated ones. These he must see if he is to 
visualize modern society, his place therein, and his rights 
and responsibilities. But his physical condition shuts out 
much of the needed vision. Morally he is but semi-respon- 
sible. Even though he be richly endowed with good-will, he 
cannot hold to action of the highest moral type because he 
cannot see what it is. 
For the man of a very low level of vitality, the curtains 
are still further drawn. There is little margin to his con- 
sciousness. His stream of thought is little more than a suc- 
cession of focal ideas. He has but little power to hold the 
many things in mind at once that are needed for seeing com- 
plex social relations. As a consequence, he is morally in- 
capacitated, irresponsible. He misses the road largely be- 
cause he cannot see where it lies. He falls back upon the 
guidance of instinct, passion, and other crude impulsions. 
He may be entirely well-meaning, and yet thoroughly 
criminal in his conduct. His irresponsibility, however, is 
but a symptom of illness. Even if criminal, the treatment 
he most needs is the hospital. 
In the preceding discussion we have been noting the posi- 
tive propulsions to right moral conduct. There is also the  
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 THE CURRICULUM 
matter of inhibitions. In the man of full vital reserves, these 
are full and strong and certain in their action. In proportion 
as reserves are depleted, and the marginal life narrowed, the 
inhibitions grow weak and uncertain. The same thoughts 
of possible action may pass through the minds of the robust 
and the devitalized. Some of these are anti-social, and refer 
to acts that are undesirable, or even criminal. In the case 
of the man of full vitality, however, when the idea of the 
harmful act arises, even though prompted by strong instinct, 
the marginal ideas of the results arise at the same time. 
He sees the undesirability and dismisses it without effort. 
With the man of low reserves the same idea may arise with 
the same degree of clearness and with no greater instinctive 
propulsion. But there does not arise the same wealth of 
marginal ideas as to the consequences. He does not see 
the harm of it. He has little or nothing to restrain him. 
The anti-social idea, therefore, discharges itself into action, 
and he commits the criminal deed. In original nature and 
training the two men may be of identical disposition. The 
difference in their acts is due simply to a difference in the 
levels of their physical vitality. 
Needed for civic control 
A state of democratic government is one in which each 
individual is largely free to shape his conduct according to 
the dictates of his best judgment. And yet the democracy of 
to-day is such a concatenation of mutual interdependencies 
that if we have both democracy and organization, the dic- 
tates of judgment on the part of all must largely be identical. 
Each must, therefore, see the whole of the social mechan- 
ism, and his individual part within the codrdinated labors of 
the whole. No other plan can possibly bring community of 
judgment. But the plan requires that the citizens have the 
power to hold a large number of things in mind at once so
-P-A-G-E-185
  TASK OF PHYSICAL TRAINING 177 
as to see the innumerable and complex relations. This is 
possible only to a citizenry of large vitality. A wise, vigorous, 
and beneficent democracy on the part of devitalized indi- 
viduals is impossible. The uncertainties of our inchoate and 
wobbly democracy are due, not entirely to ignorance and 
small-group consciousness, but in some degree also to a gen- 
eral depletion of physical vitality with its consequent nerv- 
ous irritability, narrow vision, and lack of inner restraints. 
There can be little question but that the instability of demo- 
cratic governments in certain tropical states is partially 
due — the degree none can say — to the lowered vitality of 
a European population in tropical countries. 
A problem of first magnitude in training our population 
for efficient citizenship is the training at the same time for 
the indispensable basis of physical efficiency. 
Needed for leisure occupations 
In other chapters we have tried to indicate the large place 
rightly occupied in human life by leisure occupations. For 
a number of reasons we need to develop appreciations of 
art, literature, music, science, philosophy, and religion. We 
feel that these are necessary for a stable and continuing 
form of civilization. But in a world where there are so many 
serious things to do, we cannot have them unless there is 
a surplus of leisure time and liberated energy that can be 
used for the purpose. But if physical efficiency is low, then 
productive efficiency is also low; and there are the further 
wastes of time and energy in correcting mistakes, in fighting, 
and in dissipation. There is no surplus for the humanistic 
activities. And further, things like literature, or science, 
or religion, on their high levels, are not to be appreciated 
without the richly irrigating streams of consciousness char- 
acterized by the wide margins; the types of those with the 
high physical reserves. The individual of narrow conscious-
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 THE CURRICULUM 
ness can have but restricted glimpses of these wider fields; 
fails to see things in proportion and relation; finds them 
meaningless and therefore uninteresting or wearisome; or 
perplexing, baffling, irritating. He leaves them and goes to 
pleasures of simpler and lower nature. A high humanistic 
civilization is not to be built on foundations of physical in- 
validity. 
One aspect of humanistic education must be the develop- 
ment of that degree of physical efficiency without which 
such education lacks a fundamental condition of success. 
Need for “keeping well” 
One’s major health ambition usually is to “keep well”; 
that is to say, to avoid acute illness or physical collapse. 
One can, however, keep well in this negative sense with his 
reserves of vitality at a low level. Through regularity he 
keeps out of the sick-bed and goes about his work. He be- 
comes used to the conditions, physiological habits areformed, 
and he does not know that the volume of his life might be 
doubled. Standards of vitality are lacking; modes of meas- 
uring have not been developed or applied. Everybody else 
is in much the same condition. Neither industry nor citizen- 
ship has accurately defined the standards of physical effi- 
ciency necessary for consistent success. One therefore 
“keeps well” upon a low level: but is not physically efficient. 
The result is that he is easily susceptible to attacks of 
acute diseases, like colds, grippe, bronchitis, tonsillitis, 
pneumonia, rheumatism, and a host of others. On the other 
hand, the man of large physical reserves, who almost of 
necessity has good physiological habits, finds himself, bar- 
ring accidents, practically immune from most of these 
troubles, and relatively immune from all. 
The latter is equally fortunate also in his physiological 
inhibitions. The nervous individual of depleted vitality
-P-A-G-E-187
  
  TASK OF PHYSICAL TRAINING 179 
often presents a great show of energy because of the multi- 
tude of excess movements, of emotional excitement, and 
of other needless wastes of energy. The man of high reserves, 
however, tends to be calm, poised, direct, and accurate. He 
does not waste himself in useless ways. He therefore re- 
tains himself upon his level with greater ease than one re- 
tains his position upon one of the lower levels. 
And there is also the latitude of resiliency. The man of 
large reserves may, in case of stress and strain, greatly in- 
crease his daily task through weeks or months without under- 
mining himself. Though work is unusually strenuous, the 
daily restoration is unusually large. On the lower level, 
however, lacking this same resiliency, a man cannot go far 
below his normal without finding himself the prey of acute 
illness, and of tedious recuperation. 
Training, therefore, for the ideal of keeping well, if it 
is to be done at its best, involves training for high levels of 
reserve vitality. It presents a positive program, not a mere 
negative one.

  CHAPTER XV 
PHYSICAL TRAINING 
Prrrecr physical training for child or adult is that which 
brings him to the one hundred per cent level of possible 
vitality and which holds him there. Since perfection is 
scarcely attainable, education will aim at the highest prac- 
ticable levels. This definition appears desirable because of 
the frequent limitation of the term to muscular exercise. 
Naturally physical training must always include a generous 
amount of muscular exercise; but there are other things just 
as important, such as proper sleep, food and food habits, 
air, temperatures, sunlight, balance of all physical expendi- 
tures, protection from micro-organisms, the elimination of 
wastes, healthful mental states, etc. 
Physical training has long been on the school program. 
One has, however, only to glance over the statistics of 
physical deficiency among school children, army recruits, 
or the population in general, to realize how lamentably 
this physical training has failed to accomplish the essen- 
tial purposes of abundant vitality and freedom from 
physical imperfection. Our physical training has relatively 
failed because it has lost sight of most of the vital factors for 
such a program. There has been and still persists the con- 
ception that education is a classroom affair; that only what 
can be taken care of at the school-building is to be done; 
that educational specialists are not to lead or direct or be 
otherwise concerned with experiences which must be had in 
other places within the community. The present topic more 
than any other discussed in this volume reveals the limita- 
tions of such primitive educational thought and practice.
-P-A-G-E-189
PHYSICAL TRAINING 181 
Good physical training can result but from one thing; 
namely, right living. One must actively do the things that 
enhance vitality and actively avoid those that waste it. 
Learning the facts of a book will not accomplish it; nor good 
recitations; nor good marks upon examination. Nothing 
will serve but right living twenty-four hours in the day, 
seven days in the week, and all of the weeks in the year. 
Naturally pupils must have preliminary ideas as to what 
to do. These they will secure from books, teachers, nurses, 
physicians, physical trainers and personal observation; but 
getting such ideas constitutes only the preliminary step in 
the series of activities that constitute the physical training. 
It is not even the preliminary step unless there is the con- 
scious intention on the part of those securing the ideas to 
put them to work. Let a student have any quantity of ideas 
as to what constitutes right living, if he does not.put them 
into operation they do not acquire vitality nor result in 
physical training. The curriculum must be living — with 
learning only one of several steps. 
Since muscular exercise is the part that has been most 
completely institutionalized, let us begin with that. The 
first thing to be noted is that it is mainly taken care of in 
the general out-of-school experience. Pedometers on six- 
year-old boys not in school have shown that they travel 
more than ten miles a day in their play; and the other por- 
tions of their play are probably the muscular equivalent 
of another ten miles. Since children have four waking 
hours per day out of school for every one in school counting 
all of the days of the year, if equally active in the two 
cases, they will be getting four fifths of their muscular 
experience outside of the schools. In general, however, the 
out-of-school experience is the more active; so that most of 
the developing experience is not directed by teachers. 
There are two general types of training. One is system-  
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 THE CURRICULUM 
atized gymnastics, variously called calisthenics, Swedish 
gymnastics, German gymnastics, etc. It is usually taken 
indoors. It involves wands, Indian clubs, dumb-bells, ete. 
Usually there is no spontaneity in the exercise, but it is all 
done at the arbitrary word of command. It is not play 
because the children are not actuated by the play-motive 
and it is not performed in the play-spirit. So far as it is 
work it is of the unhealthy taskmaster type. The fear is 
often expressed when “supervised play’ is recommended 
that the supervision will injure the play by depriving it of 
its spontaneity. The formal gymnastics, however, repre- 
sent a type of systematization and supervision that has 
been carried to such an extreme that the play-spirit has 
completely departed, and not even a memory of it remains. 
It is the antithesis of normal living. It therefore cannot 
adequately serve for education. 
The other type of physical training is an institutionaliza- 
tion of children’s play which retains the play-spirit. The 
leaders of the movement have been assembling a great 
repertory of plays and games for indoors and outdoors, for 
boys and girls, and for all ages and stages of development. 
These include ball-games, running-games, catching-games, 
athletics for all, rhythmic dances with and without music, 
folk-games and dances, — as pleasurable as they are effec- 
tive for training. They represent real child-life at its best 
transferred to the schools with as little change as practicable. 
It is the type to which schools are turning. 
To these play-activities must be added an increasingly 
active type of general school life. Experiential education 
is introducing more activities of the laboratory, the shop, 
the kitchen, the school garden, community observation and 
survey, active participation in practical community affairs, 
chorus singing, playing of musical instruments, field work 
in the country, etc. In normalizing education in general, 
excellent physical training is also provided for.

Perhaps it should be mentioned that where one is abnor- 
mal and is in need of corrective orthopedic exercises, like 
medicines for the sick, systematized gymnastics may often 
have a legitimate place. But it has no more place in the 
normal muscular development of normal children than have 
medicines for the well. 
Perhaps chiefly because of tradition, teachers seem to pre- 
fer the formal gymnastics. The writer had occasion to ask 
a group of elementary teachers as to the type of physical 
exercises which seemed to them most beneficial for their 
pupils. Out of sixty-eight teachers who replied, forty-eight 
preferred the formal gymnastics; twenty, the plays and 
games, especially when outdoors. When asked which type 
the children preferred, they were all agreed that the children 
preferred the games. The majority of the teachers, there- 
fore, said that in their judgment the instincts of the children 
placed there by Nature are wrong; that the children’s nor- 
mal appetites in the matter of physical exercise are unsafe 
guides; and that a type of muscular experience so foreign 
to human nature that children never indulge in it in their 
spontaneous play is the thing needed for proper develop- 
ment of their physical natures. It is safe to presume that 
instincts are safe guides until the contrary is proven. 
In the elementary schools, especially, the calisthenics is 
urged because of the relief it brings to pupils after an hour 
or so of concentrated mental work. The children need re 
laxation of attention and lowering of nervous strains. The 
need is real; but the method is not very effective. While 
five minutes of vigorous exercise in a classroom with the 
windows open may be made to serve the purpose, yet it is 
certain that the same amount of time devoted to running 
around the block would be worth immeasurably more. The 
run is a normal type of exercise. It possesses a social aspect 
and permits a degree of spontaneity lacking in the calis-
-P-A-G-E-192
SS Se BE a eT ee eR eT rere eee tay See ee No eee nea 
184 THE CURRICULUM 
thenics. It is vigorous. The slackness characteristic of 
calisthenics is impossible. Children return with flushed 
faces, deep breathing, and circulation vigorously irrigating 
the tissues. It gives them real relief from concentrated 
attention; and real exercise. 
With this compare the calisthenics, where every move- 
ment is at word of command. To quote one of the manuals: 
“Strict attention is very essential. The commands must be 
given in a commanding spirit, with expression of voice such 
as to convince pupils that they must obey and move 
promptly. The quality and the value of the exercise de- 
pends almost entirely on its execution at the command. 
The latter is the signal to perform and must clearly indicate 
that we expect accuracy and promptness.” In other words, 
this exercise is not intended to afford relief from concen- 
trated attention. Quite the reverse, they insist that atten- 
tion be absolute. 
And what is more, relief is not given through the vigor of 
the muscular exercise. Too often it is but a series of formal 
posturings, perfunctory and lifeless. One manual quaintly 
remarks: “It should be work in the garments of quiet pleas- 
ure and tranquil delight.” But when pupils are to be given 
relief from mental tensions, the negative things of quietude 
and tranquillity are not the most effective. They need a 
type of exercise that will permit the vigorous discharge or 
even explosion of pent-up energies. But spontaneous out- | 
bursts of activity are the last things desired in the formal — 
gymnastics. “Pupils should stand still during position and | 
while exercising; laughing, smiling, whispering are acts and | 
motions not favorable to good work.’ They are tranquilly | 
|   
to go through with their posturings with the faces and mien 
of wooden men. Those who know children know that their 
play cannot be normal, and that they cannot obtain proper 
relief from their study-tensions without laughing, shouting,
-P-A-G-E-193
PHYSICAL TRAINING 185 
and running about as whim impels. Such physical-training 
instructions as those quoted read like an educational fan- 
tasy instead of being things actually prescribed in many 
systems of training devised for the second decade of the 
twentieth century. 
A major advantage of the play-exercise is that it can fix 
habits for life. Adults in a sedentary age need physical 
exercises as much as children and adolescents. The training 
should prepare them for this. But adults in their recrea- 
tions refuse the taskmaster and all his ways. They will have 
spontaneity or nothing. If their training has given them 
command over a variety of sports, games, and athletics, 
and has developed appreciations and habits, they are pre- 
pared for types of exercise that they will gladly continue. 
But they will not continue formal gymnastics. Even though 
it may have accomplished the development of .youth, it 
fails to meet the continuing needs of adulthood. We are 
prone to forget that education is for adult life; and that it 
cannot be accomplished once for all time, but must be a 
lifelong continuing affair. 
Let us turn now to other factors concerned in any ade- 
quate program of physical training. In bringing children 
and youth as nearly as practicable to the one hundred per 
cent level of physical vitality and in keeping them there 
throughout school-life, food, air, sleep, etc., are just as vital 
as muscular exercise. And for the self-directed activities of 
adulthood for which education is to prepare, proper food 
habits, ventilation habits, sleep habits, etc., are just as 
important as lifelong habits of physical exercise. Education 
has institutionalized the factor which will easily transfer 
to the schools. It has not institutionalized the factors which 
will not so transfer. Yet food violations and wrong food 
habits are just as frequent and deleterious as wrong mus- 
cular habits. And there are also violations in ventilation, 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
186 THE CURRICULUM 
| sleep, the elimination of wastes, mental states, ete. The 
| physical-training inefficiency with which education is often 
+ charged and which is substantiated by facts is mainly due 
to the woeful incompleteness of its program. : 
Most of these activities cannot be transferred to the 
school-buildings. Food-activities under normal conditions, 
except possibly for the noonday luncheon in high schools, 
will not and ought not to be transferred. Sleep-activities 
will not transfer in any degree. Ventilation-activities must 
be taken care of fully at the school plant, — and this should 
be done by pupils for the sake of their training, — during 
the hours of their presence there; but it is to be taken care 
of elsewhere during their out-of-school hours. Experience 
in protection from micro-organisms can be had at the school 
during school hours, but it is an experience that is to con- 
tinue during the rest of the twenty-four hours at home and 
| throughout the general community. The regulation of tem- 
perature by means of clothing and the heating of rooms can 
be only partially transferred to the school, the major por- 
tion of the experience taking place outside. The experiences 
involved in the elimination of wastes and in bodily cleanli- 
ness are only partially transferable; the training should 
mainly be the general living experience. 
In some things, as, for example, the bath for cleanliness, 
there is occasional tendency in congested poverty sections 
of our cities to introduce at the schools bathing opportuni- 
ties actually needed in the homes, but which are not to be 
found there. This is in obedience to the educational prin- 
ciple that where community experience is seriously inferior, 
substitutionary opportunity should be provided at the 
schools. Under present conditions, therefore, we shall occa- 
sionally institutionalize types of experience which normally 
ought to be taken care of in the homes. This should be but 
a temporary educational expedient to be dispensed with as 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  
PHYSICAL TRAINING 187 
quickly as improved community conditions will permit. In 
introducing substitutionary opportunities, the schools are 
conscious agents of community progress. In proportion as 
they are successful, they reduce their portion of the task 
and turn it back where it belongs. 
We appear here to be confronted with a startling addition 
to our professional responsibilities. Progressive school sys- 
tems, however, have for some time been working on the 
program. The first step is the accurate determination by 
physicians, school nurses, and physical trainers of the 
physical condition and habits of each pupil; to find wherein 
his physique and habits are already good, and training not 
required; but more particularly wherein he is physically 
deficient, and given to wrong habits. The training problem 
is to make him and his parents conscious of his shortcom- 
ings; to give him the information needed for self-guidance; 
to assist him in the antecedent planning for the right activi- 
ties; to encourage and stimulate and see that the oppor- 
tunities are provided in the homes and the community. The 
pupils are then to be trained through self-directed but super- 
vised experience in putting their ideas to work. 
Full and right performance of these activities on the part 
of the children requires the example and leadership of the 
adult generation: parents, associates, teachers, nurses, and 
physical trainers. These specialists need to be as fully in 
contact with the community experience of the children as 
they are in contact with the school portion. Educationists 
can no more perform their services long-range than can 
physicians or farmers or blacksmiths. They must be ir 
contact with the material which is being shaped during the 
time of its shaping. Naturally this statement must be inter- 
preted in the light of the fact that both teachers and chil- 
dren have memories; and that this permits influences to be

  188 THE CURRICULUM 
The program requires that teachers and other trainers of 
youth be primarily members of the adult community, asso- 
ciated with the parents and leaders of that community. It 
is to get them out of the schoolroom into the larger life of 
affairs. It is to give their schoolroom labor its proper place 
in the total scheme of community affairs. It is to bring 
them to see education as living; and to see learning in its true 
relation to living.. It is to make men and women of a pro- 
fession that has all too often been dwarfed through living 
primarily within a child-world. Those who are to lead chil- 
dren to the high levels of adult performance, who are to 
confer the wide outlook of the adult world upon the new 
generation, are to be those whose associations are primarily 
with the mature members of the community; and whose 
outlook and valuations thus remain those of the adult world. 
Naturally teachers long accustomed to the easy grooves of 
academic tradition and the cloistral isolation in which they 
have been spared from grappling with the knotty problems 
of the full-grown world will be fearful of any such emanci- 
pation and increase of responsibilities. But the present is 
an age of swift change. We emerge into a new and human- 
istic world. Our profession is being called upon to bear a 
large responsibility in making the adjustments. Along with 
all the world, as fully and perhaps more so, our profession 
must readjust its ideas and its practices. The things are 
not to be feared; but welcomed. It is the new day of our 
professional opportunity.

  CHAPTER XVI 
THE SOCIAL FACTORS OF PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY 
In an age of multiple interdependencies and contacts, one 
cannot alone determine the conditions upon which physical 
welfare depends. These are determined by the social whole. 
His food-supply, for example, comes to him from a thousand 
hands and through a thousand channels. Properly to serve 
its purposes it must be genuine, not an adulteration or imi- 
tation. To be pure and wholesome, both sources and chan- 
nels of transit must be uncontaminated. Care of the food- 
supply is not merely a matter of personal hygiene; but a 
couperative task of the entire community. For this, social 
training with definite objectives is imperative. 
There is the same dependence of each upon all in the man- 
agement of the water supply; sewage disposal; the ventila- 
tion of street and railway cars and public buildings; the 
provision of pure air in cities, not contaminated by excess 
smoke, dust, and gases; the prevention and destruction of 
harmful micro-organisms; the prevention of flies, mosqui- 
toes, and other carriers of disease; protection against acci- 
dents in factories, mines, non-fireproof buildings, and street 
traffic; the hours and sanitary conditions of labor; provision 
of community play-facilities; elimination of noises; the social 
control of the liquor, drug, and proprietary-medicine traffic; 
the sanitation of schools, hotels, restaurants, stores, thea- 
ters, churches, hospitals, jails, public institutions; arrang- 
ing right community relations with the medical profession; 
the suppression of public nuisances; the promotion of the 
social, economic, and political relationships that are condu- 
cive to mental serenity; adequate support of the health 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 THE CURRICULUM 
department; the gathering, presentation, and use of health 
facts; the elimination of poverty as a potent, widely ramify- 
ing cause of physical invalidity; setting up of standards of 
living which recognize the physical-efficiency factor; and 
finally, the general diffusion of the knowledge, attitudes, 
and valuations needed for the codperative performance of 
these things. 
The training is to be for practical performance. It is 
therefore to use the technique of training upon the work- 
level, in which training for action is to be accomplished 
through action; in which knowledge, habits, and valuations 
are to guide, impel, and facilitate right action. 
It is difficult to arrange for practical training except in 
the Great School of community affairs. Pupils must, there- 
fore, under the guidance of teachers mingle with the adult 
world in their performance of the codperative activities. 
They will look on; serve as helpers; in places bear a little 
responsibility; in other places, larger responsibility; and 
they will talk with those performing the responsible labors. 
They will also look out upon a wider world of health rela- 
tionships through varied reading; and discuss the problems 
in their classes in health-science and civics, and with school 
physicians, nurses, and physical-training directors. Along 
with these they will antecedently plan; and with the stimu- 
lation of the adult leadership, they will perform the part 
that can legitimately be given to youth for their social 
education. 
Codperative provision of play-facilities 
We can best explain by illustration. Let us take first the 
couperative task of providing and maintaining adequate 
physical play-facilities for children and adults. One’s first 
reaction is that this task does not require training. All that 
adults have to do is to vote the money and have their offi-
-P-A-G-E-199
  SOCIAL FACTORS OF PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY 191 
cials purchase and maintain the facilities. This is true. But 
it is like saying that one does not have to be trained for 
spelling because it is only the simple task of putting the 
letters in the right order. However simple this task, men 
cannot do it until they value it, want to do it, and know the 
right order of the letters; and all admit that these require 
training. Now, voting money for sufficient purchases and 
for adequate maintenance, delegating the authority wisely, 
and holding agents responsible for effective service, — these 
more complex things require that men value physical play 
for themselves and for their children, that they want it, 
and that they know how to get the things done with cer- 
tainty, effectiveness, and economy. They need training 
first, for valuations, appreciations, attitudes of mind; and 
second, for knowledge of means and processes. Of the two 
the first is the more vital. It is prerequisite to the second. 
It requires that men know play in its essences; know the 
soul of play through having long experienced it. It requires 
also that education aim definitely at something deeper than 
knowledge — an unaccustomed task. With the soil thus 
prepared, the knowledge factor can be taken care of with 
ease. 
The valuations can be developed only where children and 
adolescents have an opportunity to live the necessary play- 
experiences — tennis, baseball, skating, basket-ball, foot- 
ball, running-games, folk-games, and dances, and all the 
rest — for all of the pupils. To read books about the topic, 
to present reports in class, and to listen to talks by the 
teacher, however fervent, is not to know play in its essences, 
not to arrive at the valuations; and therefore never to attain 
these ends of the training. 
But participation alone is not enough for the social valu- 
ations. The experiences of any individual are limited and 
partial. He needs also to observe widely; and to read for 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
192 THE CURRICULUM 
width of social vision. In this way he should view the recre- 
ational life not only of his own region, but usually indirectly 
that of various cities and regions of our country, and of 
other lands and ages. One does not realize the fundamental 
place of play in human affairs until one observes the large 
place that it has always occupied and still occupies in the 
lives of peoples over the entire earth. Pupils need, there- 
fore, to read an adequate history of human recreation 
which will reveal concretely the large place of physical (and 
at the same time usually social) play among primitive 
peoples both ancient and recent; to read the history of play 
in Greece, Rome, Persia, medizeval Europe, Spain, England, 
Germany, Japan, America, etc. In each case the chapter 
dealing with recent history should be full. 
As the participation, observations, and readings develop 
valuations, it is easy to introduce the knowledge aspects: 
the physiology of play, the simple concrete psychology, and 
the social and economic aspects. 
The cobdperative fight on disease 
A second codperative task requiring practical social train- 
ing relates to the prevention or limitation of diseases. This 
problem is considerably more difficult for education. There 
is not the same strength of propelling instinct. The tasks, 
therefore, are less congenial. The problem is rendered more 
difficult since pupils are not often to be brought into direct 
contact with diseases and disease-producing conditions be- 
cause of the dangers. In the vocational or civic education, 
one aims to bring children into as vital contact with the 
realities as possible; but here the demands of the usual peda- 
gogy are reversed by the conditions. Pupils come to appre- 
ciate work by working, and play by playing; but we do not 
think they should become acquainted with the nature of 
disease through having the diseases. This brings forward
-P-A-G-E-201
SOCIAL FACTORS OF PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY 193 
the educational problem of how to develop understand- 
ing without the direct experiences. As in history or foreign 
geography, it is simply to fall back upon the indirect experi- 
ence of concrete reading and lectures, making these full and 
vivid enough to serve in lieu of direct experiences. It is to 
use the language-avenue of contact with essential realities 
when the direct avenue of sense-contact is barred by dis- 
tance or lapse of time or danger. 
The reading should be largely historical. This can reveal 
the nature, seridusness, and gigantic proportions of the 
human struggle with disease and disease-producing condi- 
tions. To illustrate, the accompanying Figure 4 shows

of making further gains. 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
194 THE CURRICULUM 
Along with the chart there should be concrete vivid read- 
ing which reveals the action of the factors concerned in the 
struggle. The story should present biographical materials 
from the lives of men and women who were leaders in the 
movement. These should show the nature of the things 
upon which attacks were made, the modes of attack, and the 
degrees of success. The story should reveal the attack upon 
bad housing conditions, uncleanliness, bad ventilation, and 
the lack of sunlight; the rise in the general standard of liv- 
ing; the changes in wage-standards that* permitted better 
sanitation and higher standards of living; improvements in 
the care of the milk-supply; improved methods of treatment; 
segregation of the sick; improvements in the general sani- 
tation of cities; and the labors of local and general boards 
of health. 
Similar charts and readings are needed for showing the 
progress of the fight in other lands. These are especially 
needed for our own country and for one’s local community. 
As pupils thus visualize the experiences, they come to realize 
the nature and seriousness of the struggle, their sympathies 
are awakened, and they are impelled toward active partici- 
pation. Along with the concrete readings, there should be 
discussion, problem-solving, and more general readings by 
way of generalizing their information as to the factors. As 
these social interests awake, — and they must precede, — 
it will be possible to awaken interests in the more technical 
matters involved in the causation of tuberculosis; the nature _ 
of the bacilli, modes of transmission, methods of infection, 
physiological conditions conducive to infection, physiolog- 
ical and anatomical results of infection, ete. The tech- 
nical science can largely be presented through reading and 
the lectures of physicians, nurses, and science teachers; and 
through the use of well-prepared anatomical and bacterio- 
logical charts and diagrams. At some point in the course
-P-A-G-E-203
  
SOCIAL FACTORS OF PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY 195 
the microscope and bacteriological laboratory will reveal 
certain of the factors as concretely as practicable. Children 
must be given the concrete imagery needed for substantiality 
in their thinking. This is a primary condition of sanity of 
thought in this field. 
Other social studies of a comparative character for stu- 
dents of high school and later levels should reveal the geo- 
graphical, occupational, social, and other distributions of 
tuberculosis. The studies will be largely statistical and 
graphical with interpretative discussion of causes and rela- 
tionships. These studies will reveal the differences in differ- 
ent portions of the earth; the differing immunities to the 
disease on the part of different races; differences due to 
higher and lower standards of living; to different occupa- 
tions; and to variations in any of the other major factors. 
If the early levels of study in this general field are con- 
crete and experiential, it can be made as interesting to child- 
hood and youth, as any other. The human interest in a 
fight is perennial and universal. The fight upon disease is 
likewise perennial and universal; a never-ending struggle 
with hostile forces. It is in literal fact a more sanguinary 
conflict than any military war ever waged: the major num- 
ber of all human beings are killed or seriously injured long 
before their allotted years are run. If the readings can be 
so drawn that one can visualize and realize a struggle which 
is so largely invisible to the eyes, it can be given an educa- 
tional vitality hitherto little realized. 
Figure 5 shows in general outline the history of diphtheria 
jn Chicago from 1875 down to 1916. Injection of antitoxin 
was instituted in 1896. The figure shows the fight to have 
been a winning one before that time; but that since then, 
through the use of this new weapon, the battle is largely 
won. Let young people read a well-written history of the 
movement in this and other cities and countries. Let them

understand the physiological and bacteriological causes and 
conditions. Let them understand the technology of the an- 
titoxin. Let them have the charts showing the historical 
trend, — and with these things before them they cannot 
fail to see the whole situation and its factors in perspective 
and with perfect sanity. The major cause of the great 
abundance of irrational thinking in this field is that indi- 
viduals have never been supplied with the necessary mate- 
rials of thought. 
Not every fight has been a winning one. Figure 6 shows 
the history of cancer in Chicago from 1871 to 1910. It has 
increased steadily and apparently irresistibly. Other mala- 
dies like Bright’s disease, heart disease, pneumonia, etc., 
have been increasing in the same way. With them the 
fight has been a losing one. This is the case in our coun-

try at large and in all civilized countries. These foes of 
human welfare appear to be gaining an upper hand. In con- 
nection with such matters as these, where the fight is being 
lost, it is even more important that there be fullness of 
reading, fullness of direct observation so far as practicable, 
and fullness of related scientific studies by way of devel- 
oping an understanding and realization of the causes and 
conditions of these more deadly enemies. 
The history to be used is not always that of one’s own 
country; but rather that of any country where effective 
work has been done. Figure 7 shows the history in graphical 
form of smallpox in Germany since 1846. It shows that 
previous to the Franco-Prussian War, when there was no 
compulsory vaccination, the average annual death-rate per 
100,000 of population was above 24. During the disorgani- 
zation of the Franco-Prussian War, the rate rose to 262,
-P-A-G-E-206

or more than ten times the normal average. This brought 
compulsory vaccination. The result was that the average 
mortality from 1875 to 1886 was only 1.5. Since 1886 the

rate has been less than 1, or less than one twenty-fifth what 
it was during the years previous to compulsory vaccination. 
It is possible to discuss the pros and cons of vaccination with 
the negationists without accomplishing any great result. 
This is a normal mental phenomenon, and not mere intel- 
lectual perverseness. The individual negationists are not to 
blame; but rather an education that failed to give them the 
materials of thought. Let youths have an adequate history 
of smallpox; comparative figures such as shown in this 
chart; the technical information relative to the disease; the
-P-A-G-E-207
  SOCIAL FACTORS OF PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY 199 
theory of the vaccine, the mode of preparation, the theory 
of its action within the human system, etc. Having this 
information they cannot be negationists, even if they wish, 
since the conditions requisite for mental negation have been 
removed. 
For the entire health field, nothing is so much needed as 
incontestable historical evidence as to the past ravages of 
diseases, and as to the beneficent effects of modern sanitary 
and medical procedure. It is now a field of much vague 
and often bizarre thinking. Let men have the genuine ma- 
terials of thought, and they can come to think sanely. 
Because of past neglect, before leaving these topics we 
wish a little further to urge the need of vivifying reading. A 
spectacular engulfing of human life, like a Collinwood School 
or Iroquois Theater fire, an Eastland or Titanic disaster, 
under normal world-conditions, catches our attention and 
fills us with horror for days and weeks. But here in the city 
of Chicago where these words are written, to take a near 
illustration, at the present rate the lives of 12,000 children 
now in the schools of the city will be snuffed out unneces- 
sarily before their school days are over because of evil and 
uncorrected health conditions. This is the equivalent of 
more than sixty Collinwood School fires, — and but few 
take notice. It is equivalent to twenty Iroquois Theater 
fires, — but not even the city, much less the Nation, is 
aroused. It is equivalent to six or eight Eastland or Titanic 
disasters, — and we let it pass unheeded. No spectacular 
official investigations are begun. Unlike the catastrophic 
engulfing of human life, although they were small as com- 
pared to this, it does not fire legislatures, city councils, and 
school boards the country over to zealous correction of 
dangerous conditions. The causes are so omnipresent, dis- 
ease and death so diffused, everything so undefined, it is so 
distributed over the whole community, over the entire year,  
-P-A-G-E-208
    200 THE CURRICULUM 
it is so much behind closed doors, the foe so invisible, the 
fight so secret and insidious, and men are so used to it all, 
that they simply accept it as a portion of the inescapable 
human lot. The ignorant are apathetic and their imagina- 
tions are dull. They lack the apperceptive ideas for reali- 
zation of such chronic, non-striking conditions. They lack 
the imagery necessary for conjuring up the horrors that in- 
visibly surround them. Fullness and vividness of reading 
experience which effectively reconstructs and reveals the 
situation, is the remedy for such indifference to needless 
suffering and premature destruction. 
Readings should present a history of the human struggle 
with micro-organisms: the history of the fight with small- 
pox, yellow fever, Asiatic cholera, bubonic plague, typhoid, 
tuberculosis, diphtheria, pneumonia, malaria, and the others 
of the list. It should present a history of city sanitation, the 
sanitation of dwellings, schools, theaters, street and railway 
cars, etc. It should show what history usually does not 
show, namely, the large place that disease has played as a 
factor in human history, as in the disappearance of the vir- 
ile Greek and Roman races; the obliteration of the Vandal 
Kingdom in Africa and Italy; the disappearance of every 
German army that during the period of the Holy Roman 
Empire descended into Italy; the disappearance of the 
American Indians of North America, not before the guns, 
but before the diseases of the white invaders; the retarda- 
tion of the civilization of the tropical regions, ete. Pupils 
should read vivid accounts of the history of sanitation in 
Panama under both French and Americans; the story of 
Gorgas in his sanitation of Cuba and in his clearing-up of 
the typhus epidemic in Serbia; the story of the obliteration 
of Asiatic cholera in the Philippines; of the fight of the Jap- 
anese upon disease before and during the Russo-Japanese 
War; and so on through an extended list. It is most remarke
-P-A-G-E-209
    
SOCIAL FACTORS OF PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY 201 
able that the historians in drawing up lists of influences 
that have controlled the mutations of human affairs should, 
except in occasional instances, have overlooked the funda- 
mental influence of this biological factor. 
As a profession we have not yet come sufficiently to value 
reading as a mode of experience. We have valued it for 
securing systematized information which can be recited 
and examined upon. We have not, however, sufficiently 
looked upon it as formative experience which flows through 
the consciousness, leaving its effects in the general mental 
cast, in perspective, in valuations and attitudes, and in a 
rich background of conscious mental life. Most of such 
experience is forgotten and should be forgotten in the sense 
that most details are not recallable. Forgetting is as normal 
a mental function as remembering. The human mind can 
hold only a limited quantity of memories in recallable form. 
In order that this little be of the right sort, it must be the 
residuum from a wealth of mostly forgotten experience. This 
residuum is largely a texture of generalizations from one’s 
concrete experience in which are intermingled concrete 
memories of some of the more striking, more frequently 
repeated, or more recent experiences. These remembered 
concretes are usually partially digested matters that have 
not yet lost their identity in their assimilation into the 
general. 
We are not recommending readings that are to be learned 
or memorized any more than those of the morning news- 
paper. If the experiences are of the right sorts, if they have 
depth and warmth and emotional potency, the foundation 
will have been laid for the desirable generalizations. These 
latter are the things that most need to be remembered; and 
fortunately nature has provided for them in the process of 
generalization through natural assimilation of the concrete 
details. They need not be memorized after the plan of the
-P-A-G-E-210
  202 THE CURRICULUM 
old-fashioned textbook method. They are the natural fruits 
of experience if it can be made normal and full. And there 
are also the other fruits of this experience: right attitudes 
of mind, standards of judgment, valuations, emotional sym- 
pathies, dynamic tendencies of the will, etc. These latter 
are just as important as the intellectual generalizations. 
They are, however, practically neglected in their entirety 
where education consists of textbook fact-memorization. 
Practical activities 
What can young people do by way of putting their social 
health-ideas to work, and their attitudes, valuations, and 
social sympathies? To begin with, there are certain non- 
specialized labors related to the public health which they 
can perform. They can engage in anti-fly campaigns. They 
can make accurate surveys of every city block by way of 
locating and mapping every fly-breeding spot. In places 
where they can have control, they can eliminate the fly- 
breeding conditions. They can make effective public report 
on places where they have no control. They can continue 
these processes until the community is sufficiently awakened 
for codperative regulation of places inaccessible to the young 
people. Within recent years Cleveland has shown what can 
be accomplished where there is zealous and enlightened 
leadership. Along with the activities referred to, pupils 
can codperatively undertake the destruction of the flies 
themselves through the placing of traps, fly-paper, etc. They 
can carry their surveys still further and show upon another 
map the distribution of fly-infested food-supplies and fly- 
protected food-supplies; upon a third, disease-breeding places 
to which fly carriers have access and from which they may 
carry diseases. Most of the facts will relate to things over 
which pupils have no power of direct correction. They will 
simply be gathering inspectorial facts for the community.
-P-A-G-E-211
SOCIAL FACTORS OF PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY 208 
But this is as practical a task as the actual obliteration 
of the harmful conditions. It is really more important for 
their civic education, since the things which they can them- 
selves do with their own hands are comparatively few; but 
the number of things which they are to do coperatively on 
the basis of a general community understanding are numer- 
ous. The inspectorial labors provide both intellectual and 
social training for these codperative labors. 
To be fruitful for community life or for education, there 
must be joint responsibility of adults and children with 
adults supplying leadership and delegating responsibility 
to the children. A child campaign alone is a social abnormal- 
ity, good neither for practical results nor for education. 
Other types of incompletely specialized activities in which 
the students can participate are anti-mosquito campaigns, 
city clean-up campaigns, current thoughtfulness and care 
for the cleanliness of streets, back yards, etc., codperative 
participation in the ventilation of public places, destruction 
of vermin and pests of other sorts than those enumerated, 
etc. These and others of similar type can be carried through 
on plans analogous to those described in the case of the anti- 
fly activities. Pupils also have an opportunity to codperate 
practically with the labors of specialists of many kinds as 
these touch the various homes; for example, in the garbage 
disposal, the smoke nuisance, sewage disposal, the drainage 
of city lots, quarantine, protection of the water-supply, and 
elimination of nuisances. After all is said, however, codper- 
ative health activities will largely be taken care of by spe- 
cialized civic departments: the board of health, city food 
inspectors, market inspectors, milk inspectors, the city 
water department, the garbage and waste disposal depart- 
ment, the sewage disposal department, the playground 
department, the city smoke inspectors, building inspectors, 
the factory inspection service, etc. The intelligent city, 
   
-P-A-G-E-212
204 THE CURRICULUM 
village, or rural region of the future will see that part-time 
work is provided mature pupils for training purposes in 
connection with these several codperative activities. The 
quantity of responsibility placed upon them probably need 
not be large. That they be in contact with the realities is 
the principal thing. 
While such part-time participation is needed for substan- 
tiality, the major portion of their practical labors in con- 
nection with all of these things will necessarily be the 
gathering of facts, the making of surveys, the preparation 
of publicity charts, diagrams, statistical tables, reports that 
are to be used in the inspectorial labors of the total com-

CHAPTER XVII 
‘THE FUNCTION OF PLAY IN HUMAN LIFE 
Aux of our discussion, whether of play or work, assumes 
that education is preparation for the affairs of the mature 
world. This is not to lose sight of the fact that the educa- 
tion of the nine-year-old child is to prepare for the life of 
the ten-year-old; and this in turn for that of the eleven-year- 
old. But at the same time and in the same way, education 
during the formative stages of childhood and youth is to 
prepare for the long stage of maturity. 
Attention is called to this, since we are not here primarily 
concerned with the plays of children for their own sake, but 
with play-experience as preparation for the leisure occu- 
pations.of adult men and women. We are discussing train- 
ing for adult life as fully as in the chapters on vocational or 
civic education. It is true that play is a large factor in the 
lives of youth, since it is man’s fundamental education; but 
it is no less one of the largest factors in normal adult life. 
Dr. Woods Hutchinson has a lecture entitled “Which is 
the life of man — his work or his play?” His answer is, “It 
is his play.” Play is both end and process. 
“Man is a whole man only when he plays,” goes the old 
proverb. As worded by Schiller: “‘Man plays only when 
he is a human being in the fullest sense of the word, and he 
has reached full humanity only when he plays. This propo- 
sition will acquire great and deep significance when we shall 
learn to refer to it the doubly serious ideas of duty and 
destiny. It will then sustain the entire superstructure of 
esthetic art and of the yet more difficult art of life.” 
Leisure occupations are physical, intellectual, social, and

eesthetic: conversation, observation of men and things, con- 
struction and operation of things, hobbies, sports, games, 
» athletics, reading, travel, music, painting; scientific experi- 
mentation prompted by interest in science; the reading of + 
history, economics, philosophy, science, foreign languages, 
mathematics, and technology, when prompted by love of the 
subject and delight in the intellectual experience; religious 
meditations and philosophic contemplation. The field is 
wide. | 
Men and women have considerable leisure time. A week 
consists of one hundred and sixty-eight hours. After allow- 
ing twelve hours a day for sleep and ek there remain 
eighty-four hours per week. With an eight-hour day and 
Saturday half-holiday, the miatieal is forty-four hours 
and the leisure-week, forty hours. With a labor-week that 
meets general approval, a man has almost as much time for 
his leisure as for his work. 
There is more opportunity than the figures show. Recre- 
ational activities are mingled with work-activities. One’s 
eyes, one’s attention, one’s thoughts are, while he works, 
continually roving over the things of his environment for 
no serious purpose. Very much of this watchfulness and 
thought as to things going on about him is not an essential 
portion of his immediate task. It is a leisure occupation as 
completely as his observations out of a car window. Then 
there is conversation with his associates concerning things 
unrelated to his work. Where conversation is not possible, 
there is meditation, reminiscence, day-dreaming, planning 
of social activities, and the consideration of one’s current 
problems. The mechanization of industry often provides 
favorable conditions for this quiet intellectual leisure occu- 
pation. The man performs his work with no more sind 
upon it than if he were a machine. His hands perform the 
labors, but he himself is out in the wide fields of imaginative   
 
-P-A-G-E-217

experience. Although working eight or ten hours a day at 
a mechanical trade, many of these may really be hours in 
which his consciousness is mainly devoted to leisure occupa- 
tion. Such a man’s play-life even during the hours of his 
work may be larger than his work-life. 
And even beyond this, there is opportunity. It consists in 
transfusing the work-activities with the play-spirit. For 
example, Mr. Edison is reported to have said, “I think I 
have never done a day’s work in my life.” Although devot- 
ing ten to twenty hours a day to laboratories and shops, the 
labors have been so fully vivified by the quickening spirit 
of play that sense of drudgery and bondage to conditions 
have been eliminated. When a man thus attains his free- 
dom, when he feels himself master over his work rather than 
the servant of his work, he has made it one of his large fields 
of recreational experience. Since work of this transfigured 
type is really so much more accurate, proficient, and pro- 
ductive of material results, one of the ends of vocational 
education must be this transfiguration. 
Education must take note of the disparities of human 
character. Even within the same race, men often seem so 
different as scarcely to belong to the same species. Com- 
pare, for example, a group of bankers, bishops, or judges 
with the hard-handed laborers upon our streets or in our 
mines and factories. The professional men stand poised, 
erect, full-statured, physically flexible, buoyant with energy. 
Intellectually, they are rich in stores of the world’s wisdom 
and their mental horizon and outlook are as wide as the 
world itself. Their social presence is stimulating, exhila- 
rating, contagiously uplifting. They seem to be a revela- 
lion of the nature of complete manhood. On the other 
hand, the members of the hard-handed army of unskilled 
labor, especially if they have reached middle life, in large 
portion present a different picture. Physically they all too 
 
-P-A-G-E-218

often appear worn, hard, and misshapen. Heavy, impassive 
Jeatures reveal an all too frequent sluggishness and vacancy 
of mental life. Too often they have little information be- 
yond that picked up at random in the course of a meager 
and sordid experience. Their mental life too often has but 
a narrow horizon, and but little sky. ‘Their pleasures too 
often are upon a sensuous level. With exteriors so hard and 
impassive, with conversation so crude and materialistic, 
with minds so circumscribed or vacant, their social presence 
is often wanting in many desirable factors. One feels in- 
stinctively that these do not represent the norms of person- 
ality. Both high and low turn instinctively to the other 
type as the norms of what men might and should be. 
The differences are largely due, not to heredity, but to 
differing developmental conditions. The large place of play 
in the process is well stated by Professor James in one of his 
striking paragraphs: — | | | 
Compare the accomplished gentleman with the poor atta or 
tradesman of a city: during the adolescence of the former, objects 
appropriate to his growing interests, bodily and mental, were 
offered as fast as the interests awoke, au) as a consequence, he is 
armed and equipped at every angle to meet the world. Sport came 
to the rescue and completed his education where real things were 
lacking. He has tasted of the essence of every side of human life, 
being sailor, hunter, athlete, scholar, fighter, talker, dandy, man 
of affairs, etc., all in one. Over the city poor boy’s youth no such 
golden opportunities were hung, and in his manhood no desire for 
most of them exist. Fortunate it is for him if gaps are the only 
anomalies his instinctive life presents; perversions are too often 
the fruit of his unnatural bringing up. | |

Defects of personality may be dus, not merely to lack of

  THE FUNCTION OF PLAY IN HUMAN LIFE 11 
developmental opportunity, but also to failure to maintain 
gains that have previously been made. The classical illus- 
tration is presented in Darwin’s autobiography: — 
Up to the age of thirty or beyond it, poetry of many kinds gave 
me great pleasure; and even as a schoolboy I took intense delight 
in Shakespeare, especially in the historical plays. I have also said 
that pictures formerly gave me considerable, and music very great, 
delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of 
poetry. I have tried lately to read Shakespeare and found it so 
intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have also almost lost my 
taste for pictures or music. . .. My mind seems to have become a 
kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections 
of facts; but why this should have caused the atrophy of that part 
of the brain alone on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot con- 
ceive. ... If I had to live my life again, I would have made a rule 
to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every 
week; for perhaps the parts of my brain now atrophied would thus 
have been kept alive through use. The loss of these tastes is a loss 
of happiness and may possibly be injurious to the intellect, and 
more probably to the moral character, by enfeebling the emotional 
parts of our nature. 
If this dying away of certain of the higher portions of the 
personality should be so marked in the case of a studious, 
scholarly man like Darwin, who had traveled widely, read 
widely, and who was in constant association with the leaders 
of science, it is reasonable to suppose that in the case of that 
great majority of men and women of lesser opportunity 
in whom the original developments were less complete, the 
atrophy of the higher powers might well be much more 
marked. Thus the large gains during school-days are lost, 
soon or late, if there is not continuing exercise for mainte- 
nance. Things must be earned before one can possess them; 
but they must be re-earned continually in order that posses- 
sion may continue. One’s work-activities are usually too 
narrow and specialized to provide for the necessary protec- 
tion against the decays of disuse; and the conditions grow 
   
-P-A-G-E-220

| 212 THE CURRICULUM 
worse as specialization increases. Interest-driven leisure oc- 
cupations alone can provide the necessary counteracting in- 
fluences. In the face of the maleficent influence of special- 
ization upon personality, play is again Nature’s normalizer. 
It maintains the personality against decay. 
Play is as normal for adulthood as for childhood. During 
childhood it is to unfold the potential powers and make 
them actual; and at each level to maintain the gains of 
earlier levels. During adulthood it is to maintain for a life- 
time all of the awakened and expanded aspects of person- 
ality so as to prevent withering and disappearance. 
It is probable that in the newer schools of the oncoming 
humanistic age, education for leisure occupations will be 
recognized as one of the most serious educational tasks — if 
not the largest and most vital of all. Vocational education is 
receiving enthusiastic and liberal support because it prom- 
ises increased production of corn and cotton, of machinery 
and clothing, and the other material means of life. Leisure 
occupations relate to the production not of the means of 
life, but of life itself; of fully rounded character; and the 
continuing maintenance of that character. If we are to 
educate for efficiency in producing the means of life, we 
should also educate efficiently for the production of life 
itself. | 
In order to develop sufficiently the educational implica- 
tions, we must introduce a little of the physiology and psy- 
chology of play. The first thing to be noted is the relation 
of exercise to the development and maintenance of structures 
and functions. Everybody knows that muscles require 
exercise for normal development of both structure and 
function; and for maintenance. It is not so well known, but 
just as true, that exercise is necessary for mental function- 
ing, social functioning, esthetic activities, religious and 
philosophic contemplation, appreciations of science and lit
-P-A-G-E-221
    
THE FUNCTION OF PLAY IN HUMAN LIFE 213 
erature and art, sympathies and emotions in general; and 
for maintenance of the power to function. 
A second thing to be noted is the instability of growth- 
results. Structures and functions disappear when unused: 
and relative to man’s needs, the atrophy is rapid. It would 
be a fine thing indeed and make enormously for economy 
if structures and powers once developed remained perma- 
nent and constant. Our educational problem would then 
be to bring the muscles to their proper level of development 
and then simply leave them there with a constant strength 
and power, whether used or unused, for an entire lifetime. 
The task would further be to develop one’s mental powers 
in desirable measure and then to leave them with unchanged 
strength during the rest of one’s days, whether used much 
or little, regularly or irregularly. It would be a beautiful 
arrangement; and it sometimes appears that educational 
practices presuppose that such conditions exist. But un- 
fortunately man is not so constituted. The moment he 
relaxes his normal exercise of muscles, heat-producing ap- 
paratus, and nerve-structures, or his mental, social, ssthetic, 
and other activities, whether he be child or adult, that mo- 
ment the structures begin to atrophy and the powers to 
decline; and the loss is more rapid than generally realized. 
Relative to the abruptness of frequent need, the upbuilding 
or re-upbuilding is slow. This is well illustrated in the pres- 
ent training of our national army. It was predicted that 
should ever national danger arise, an efficient army would 
spring into existence overnight. The need came with 
suddenness; but the men in general were found to be in- 
sufficiently developed in muscular strength, endurance, and 
resistance to climatic conditions. In part they represent 
incomplete physical development; in part atrophy due to 
sedentary life. They may assemble under the colors in a 
few days, but they cannot so quickly call into existence the 
necessary powers.
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 THE CURRICULUM 
A further principle is that heredity provides the possibility 
of a much fuller development than demanded by the conditions 
of civilization; and play must make up the deficit. Rightly to 
appreciate this we must look first to the place of play in pre- 
civilized life.

Fia. 8. The varying degrees of intensity in man’s primitive biological 
struggle. Represented by the height of the vertical lines. 
Figure 8 is designed to represent heamidiiy the varying 
intensity in the demands of the primitive biological struggle 
over a period of time. In those early ages the winter was 
often a period of scarcity, of famine, of struggle with cli- 
matic elements and with competing hostile tribes. Condi- 
tions often demanded the expansion and exercise of one’s 
full potential powers. The demand for effort is represented 
by the distance between the horizontal lines. With the 
coming of summer, the increase in the food-supply, the 
decrease in the competition with hostile tribes, and the 
temporary disappearance of the climate struggle, the de- 
mands for strenuous exertion were relaxed. This was so 
complete that there was no need of the men’s doing any- 
thing for months at a time. But the seasons brought recur- 
rence of the struggle. The figure indicates that conditions 
may precipitate the struggle very suddenly; and thus after 
months of inactivity call for instant functioning of the indi- 
vidual’s full powers.
-P-A-G-E-223
  THE FUNCTION OF PLAY IN HUMAN LIFE 213 
Let us for a moment suppose that there were under such 
conditions no instinctive tendencies to play. Then in pro- 
portion as the demands of the struggle relaxed, the indi- 
vidual would grow correspondingly quiescent in muscular 
effort, in observation, in thought, in invention, in-conver- 
sation and development of ideas in conversation, and in 
other social activities. As exercise thus relaxed, the powers 
would atrophy in proportion to the degree of disuse. Figure 
8, therefore, shows what the rise and fall of the actual 
powers of the individual under such conditions would be, — 
provided the atrophy of unused powers was as rapid as the 
diminution in the demands of the struggle, and the recovery 
of those same powers could be as rapid as the onset of the 
struggle where it is relatively sudden. 
Unfortunately the latter supposition is not true. Recovery 
of atrophied powers is relatively slow; yet the need of rapid 
recovery under primitive conditions was frequent. War 
came unexpectedly; famine also. Men had always, there- 
fore, to be in a state of preparedness to meet the sudden 
onsets. Nature could not permit man’s exercise, therefore, 
to diminish in proportion as the struggle grew relaxed. The 
loss of powers would make the individual the prey of any 
sudden and unexpected attack. If caught unprepared he 
would find himself in the condition of an army that has not 
kept up its drill and which when called to sudden and un- 
expected war finds itself weak, flabby, and lacking in endur- 
ance. Such a condition would not only invite, but under the 
circumstances would result, in destruction. The man, there- 
fore, during those days had to be kept drilled during the 
period of relaxation in the biological struggle in order that 
he should be ready for the times of stress. He must not be 
caught unprepared. 
The level of needed preparedness is roughly represented 
by Figure 9. The segments of the vertical lines below the

curved line AB represent the portion of his preparedness 
provided for by his serious activities. The segments above 
the line AB represent the portions of his preparedness that 
could not be taken care of by his serious activities and which 
therefore had to be otherwise provided for. So far as the 
struggle of the moment was concerned, this surplus of powers 
was mere luxury. Primitive man was not intelligent enough 
to know that during periods of biological relaxation he must 
keep his body and mind in a continual state of preparedness 
and that continuing functioning was necessary for the pur- 
pose. He was notoriously lacking in foresight; and what is 
more, his knowledge of educational processes was not suffi- 
cient to enable him wisely to choose the best means. When 
enlightened twentieth-century individuals are so lacking in 
these things, obviously it could not ie expected that prim- 
itive man would be continually looking forward to the re- 
newal of the struggle and consciously keeping up his gym- 
nastic exercises of mind and body in order that he be always 
prepared. And yet the great variety of exercises had to 
continue. For this reason Nature provided man with his 
wealth of play tendencies. He was impelled to play at 
fighting when real fighting was no longer necessary; to hunt 
and fish for pleasure when not required for the food-supply; 
to travel about over the region; to move among his fellows;
-P-A-G-E-225
  THE FUNCTION OF PLAY IN HUMAN LIFE 217 
to converse concerning the tribal experiences; to observe 
the actions of men and animals and the elements; and all 
for the mere pleasure of the activities. Although not de- 
manded by the struggle, he ran and jumped, swam and 
climbed, shouted and danced, in obedience to the prompt- 
ings of Nature that he exercise and thus keep himself ever 
ready for serious action when it came. The pleasure was 
not the end; but it seemed to him to be the end. It was the 
lure. The man who did not so exercise in play by way of 
maintaining the necessary surplus of powers was cut down 
in the next onset of the struggle; and his heredity was cut 
down with him. Only those endowed with strong play- 
tendencies were preserved; and to their sons were trans- 
mitted the same play-tendencies. In those days as well, play 
was Nature’s normalizer, disciplining individuals whose 
intelligence — likewise hereditary — was too frail to direct 
the process. 
In those early ages children were differently situated. In 
periods of greatest hardship, the burden fell first and most 
heavily upon them. More than with the adults, they had 
ever to be as completely prepared as possible. With them, 
therefore, the play-tendencies were urgent and incessant. 
Not only was there for them this purpose of vigilant main- 
tenance of all of the gains, but there was also the original 
unfoldment of their abilities. For both purposes the in- 
stincts needed to be certain in their action and strongly im- 
pelling. Seen biologically, children’s play was — and is — 
the most serious function of childhood. It was then — and 
to-day should be — the largest factor in the child’s educa- 
tion. We refer here, of course, to play in its wider sense, as 
it includes social, intellectual, and esthetic activities as well 
as the physical. 
This discussion of the primitive Sedan is for the pur- 
pose of bringing home to us a realization of the present sit-

uation and the nature of our educational problems. The 
potentialities of man developed during those early ages have 
been handed down to our own generation in heredity. The 
possible degree of unfoldment of our powers was largely 
determined for men of the present within those early days. 
We are but the living portion of the same series of genera- 
tions. The types of activities which they needed to perform 
for their full unfoldment, we yet need to perform, — though 
with modifications to meet artificial conditions. The im- 
pelling tendencies which actuated them are also the only 
ones given to us to-day. | 
Although man’s original nature has not greatly changed, 
his external environment and the conditions of the struggle 
have been greatly transformed. Figure 10 roughly indicates

certain changes in the struggle. The distance between the 
two horizontal lines is intended to represent schematically 
the magnitude of man’s hereditary potential powers; the 
vertical lines, the quantity of energy to be expended in 
the twentieth-century type of biological struggle. In large 
measure, the struggle has been evened over the year. The 
labors of factories and mines, commerce and transportation, 
etc., are now much the same from year’s end to year’s end. 
In our abundant provision of clothing, fuel, and shelter, we 
have mostly banished winter and evened the climatic strug-
-P-A-G-E-227

gle. In developing a world agricultural community, systems 
of transportation and storage, we have banished famine. 
In spite of the present atavistic European outbreak, we 
think that we have done most of the things necessary for 
banishing war. In the invention of labor-saving machinery, 
in the specialization of industry, and in organization under 
trained direction, we seem to have banished the necessity 
for thought, judgment, observation, accurate and detailed 
information, and comprehensiveness of understanding of 
things about us, for the great majority of men. Primitive 
man had to be watchful, alert, and thoughtful as to the sig- 
nificance of a host of things within his environment. He 
had to keep informed as to what other people around him 
were thinking and doing. He had to be kept alive in his 
social sympathies so as instantly to rally to the support of 
his fellow tribesmen in sudden emergency. Civilization has 
diminished the need for these things. A man can now be 
little — in body, in mind, in social responsiveness, in moral 
responsibility — and yet survive in the relaxed conditions 
of the modern struggle. Specialization can hold us in such 
narrow grooves and provide us with such meager opportuni- 
ties for experiences that we can pass through life in a state 
of littleness. It is to live but half a life — or less. 
Such a state of half-life means, not merely half-realization 
alone, but also subnormality or abnormality of even that 
which is realized. It is not good physically to have powers 
only half-developed. It means flabbiness, incodrdination, 
inaccuracy, lowered physiological inhibitions, susceptibility 
to disease, lowered reserves of vitality, and a consequent 
imperfect foundation for one’s mental, social, zesthetic, and 
moral life. 
Intellectual half-life or quarter-life is not good for one 
mentally, even though under another’s direction he perform 
the tasks that fall to his lot. It means intellectual flabbiness,

a leaning upon others, uncertainty, inaccuracy, lack of con- 
fidence, depleted stores of information, an unobserving 
mind, lack of initiative and inventiveness, inadaptibility, 
inertia, and most other intellectual weaknesses. Such an 
individual lives within a petty environment and fails even 
to see the things within that environment. He lacks out- 
look upon the wide world, upon the past, and imagination 
as to the possibilities of the future. Such a man is not of the 
type demanded by twentieth-century conditions. 
In the same way the half-exercise and half-realization of 
one’s social powers results equally in social ill-health: social 
disintegration, enfeebled social sympathies, incodrdination 
of individuals within the group except as enforced by exter- 
nal authority, social unresponsiveness, lack of consideration 
for others, lack of tact, social irresponsibility, and other 
social ills. 
  Fia. 11. To represent the portion of man’s potential development that in 
our present civilized state is dependent upon continuing play-activities. 
Figure 11 is designed to represent schematically the pos- 
sible and desirable additional expansion of one’s powers. The 
unbroken segments of the vertical lines below AB represent 
the fraction of one’s possible powers that is sustained by 
one’s serious activities; the broken segments above AB, the 
fractional portion that is to be added and sustained through 
play — or not at all. Herein lies man’s opportunity to live 
above and beyond the ineluctable dictates of stern natural 
necessity.
-P-A-G-E-229
  THE FUNCTION OF PLAY IN HUMAN LIFE 221 
The vocational, civic, and hygienic education already dis- 
cussed seek to lower the level AB, and thus still further to 
reduce the call for serious activity; and to increase both the 
opportunity and the necessity for leisure occupations. 
Just as in early days, this further expansion is to be 
effected through activities of the play type. Now as then 
it is to be at the prompting of normal play-instincts — 
though the artificial conditions of modern life will make a 
large amount of conscious guidance necessary. No less than 
then, the pleasure-motive — under guidance — must be the 
impelling force in childhood and adulthood; even though 
this pleasure be now, as then, but a lure and not the end. 
It is unhealthy to be too conscious of the nature of the ends. 
The play should long be unsophisticated. It should be 
largely so throughout life. 
Rightly to appreciate the place of play in adult life, one 
has to examine the activities of men among those social 
classes where from childhood into adulthood the play- 
impulses have had full opportunity to function; where they 
have not been stifled by adverse conditions and barren 
opportunity. It is best revealed by men and women of the 
leisure classes and of independent means. They have all 
they need, and there is therefore no call for them to act. 
The general social machinery protects them in their idleness. 
They might sit at home in year-long undisturbed quietude 
without thought or care. But they do not; and they cannot. 
They are most miserable if they are not doing something 
most of the time, and filling life to the brim. They must 
travel, or attend the opera, play bridge, speculate on the 
stock exchange, attend dinners, dances, and other social 
functions, deck themselves in gorgeous plumage, read the 
latest novels, go cruising in their private yachts, motoring 
from coast to coast and beyond the seas, hunting in the 
Adirondacks, fishing in the wilds of Canada, lion-hunting in

Africa, climbing the Alps, placing their money at Monte 
Carlo, or traveling in the war-zone to get the thrills. In 
their restlessness is revealed the driving power of the play- 
tendency in adult life. The results are beneficent. This is 
particularly true if they have been wise enough to select a 
balanced assortment of experiences; and if there has been 
intermingled enough of serious effort to give them ballast. 
They are instantly recognized to be larger men and women 
than those who have been held within the narrow grooves 
of serious vocational, civic, and family duty. They are felt 
most nearly to approximate the full desirable stature of 
manhood and womanhood. They may be social parasites, 
consuming in their play what others have earned in sweat 
and blood. Nature’s rewards on the side of personality are 
not in proportion to one’s economic usefulness and produc- 
tiveness; but rather to the volume and variety of one’s 
experiences. It is not the conscientious individual who tries 
to do nothing except what is demonstrably useful who most 
fully realizes himself. 
Professor Groos’s volume on The Play of Man shows that 
man is a many-sided creature with plays of great number 
and diversity, involving all levels of his being. There is, in 
fact, a hierarchy of plays ranging from the gratification of 
physical appetites and the pleasures of simple sensation at 
one end of the scale up to the highest forms of intellectual 
play as found in science and philosophy. At the lower end 
of the scale, one finds such activities as eating, drinking, 
smoking, sex-activities, and crude sensations of brightness, 
warmth, etc. Somewhat higher are+physical sports like 
wrestling, boxing, athletics, tennis, football, and other 
games of physical contest. Somewhere about this level pos- 
sibly we should classify social dancing. Somewhat farther 
along the scale are the folk-dance, marches, processions, pag- 
eantry, and the like, A thing that has to be variously classi-

ing to theme and character. Rather high on the scale are 
purely intellectual games, such as chess, whist, etc. Still 
higher are the fine arts, music, literature, drama, opera, etc. 
Naturally the level of these is determined by theme and 
artistic character. They may deal with the lowest activities 
of man and be near the bottom of the scale, or with man’s 
most transcendent activities and be near the top. At the 
highest end of the scale, most removed from the sensuous, 
are the rarefied austere leisure occupations of intellectual 
character: history, science, mathematics, philosophy, and 
the contemplations of a developed religion. 
The levels of this hierarchy are very differently supported 
by instincts. The physical activities at the bottom are 
prompted by the most powerful and permanent instincts. 
These are so compelling that if full opportunities for satis- 
faction are given, and strong inhibitions do not exist, the 
lower activities are almost certain to be carried to excess. 
In a state of nature the physical and herd instincts had to 
be strong in order that the race might survive. Civilized 
men have inherited them in their original strength and often 
they seem stronger than needful. Even if not so, they seem 
to be disproportionate. Civilized man needs more powerful 
and permanent instinctive propulsions for the higher activi- 
ties. But the instincts prompting to high intellectual en- 
deavor, to large-group consciousness, and to humanizing 
art are relatively feeble, flickering, and transitory. Man’s 
original nature, shaped by primitive conditions, is fitted 
for simple materialistic small-group conditions; and is not 
rightly balanced for the new conditions of civilization. 
This makes the task of education for civilization enormously 
difficult. 
Activities on all of the levels have a rightful place; but 
owing to the inequalities of inner propulsion, the amounts
-P-A-G-E-232
  22h THE CURRICULUM 
of educational effort required for the different levels are 
vastly different. Given right living conditions as the en- 
vironment of youth, the activities on the lower levels are 
so fully prompted and guided by instincts that the Great 
School of experience will largely take care of them without 
much attention from educationists. Those of the higher 
levels, however, will demand not only a right stimulating 
community environment but also the greatest possible 
expert stimulation, encouragement, and leadership from 
teachers. For the lower levels the curriculum problems on 
the positive side are small; for the higher, they are the 
most subtle, complex, and difficult presented to the pro- 
fession. They involve the development of a twentieth- 
century democratic type of humanism; one that in an age 
of efficiency can be made efficiently to humanize all nor- 
mal individuals. The curriculum-maker has an inspiring 
task that in large part is new. 
Let us now note the relation of this humanistic training 
to certain problems. There is, for example, the question 
raised by the arrest of development caused by specialized 
industry: How are workers, men or women, to keep young 
and plastic in a specialized age which everywhere demands 
youth and plasticity and which tends to throw specialized 
individuals above forty upon the scrap-heap? It is not 
really a matter of years, but of mentality. Some are old 
at thirty; others are plastic and adaptable at seventy. We 
have factories at present where each workman is auto- 
matically discharged when he reaches the age of forty. By 
that age it is felt that the withering results of specialization 
have so cut down a man’s effectiveness that he must yield 
to those not yet so crippled. In the beginning, the hot 
blood of youth, its spontaneity and its enthusiasms, lead 
to such initial expansion of character, outlook, and vigor of 
action as to give one the efficiency demanded. But continu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  THE FUNCTION OF PLAY IN HUMAN LIFE 225 
ing life within the grooves and the dwindling of those as- 
pects of personality not exercised by this mechanized exis- 
tence result inevitably in dwarfing the individual in body 
and mind and social responsiveness. It means the loss of 
the vitality required for spontaneity and plasticity; and 
of ideas, outlook, and enthusiasms. If the individual has 
not during the blossoming season of youth developed wide 
ranges of awakened interests, quickened appreciations, 
habits of participation in an extensive series of leisure occu- 
pations upon all levels, including the intellectual, old age 
is reasonably certain to set in early and bring about an 
incapacity that is real; and which is recognized by the 
practical leaders of industry. It is a frequent and tragic 
misfortune that is unnecessary and due simply to a narrow, 
incomplete type of education that has not sufficiently es- 
tablished its objectives. 
There is a related problem. We have referred to the 
necessity within a democracy of mutual respect on the part 
of the members of the various social classes. This doctrine 
we have long tried to preach into men; but without no- 
ticeable success. Here as everywhere it is reality and not 
sentimentality, however well-intentioned, that in the long 
run determines. We respect a man according to the char- 
acter of his personality. We withhold respect in the pro- 
portion in which the man falls short of what we consider 
the desirable stature of full manhood and womanhood. In 
the long run, therefore, the esteem in which different social 
classes are held will depend upon the characters of the men 
and women who make up those classes. The use or use- 
lessness of their labors will have relatively little to do di- 
rectly with the amount of respect accorded. A man is re- 
spected for what he is, not for his economic productiveness. 
The deficient esteem accorded labor is not, as often 
thought, because their clothes and hands are soiled and

their faces covered with the dust of industry. The profes- 
sional man at his golf, his hobbies in home-shop or garden, 
or on hunting or fishing expeditions, may be no better 
dressed and carry as great a quantity of dust and grime. 
In their case, as in all cases, “‘ The man’s the man for a’ 
that.” The lack.of respect accorded heavy-handed labor 
has enormously deeper roots than mere external appear- 
ance. It is the disfigurement of the man’s personality 
mainly due to the lack of humanistic opportunity. It is 
not the fault of the man, but of the conditions under which 
his nature was unfolded; of his education. Industrial 
education designed to increase productive efficiency will 
not alone solve the problem. It requires the twentieth- 
century type of humanism, glimpses of which we have tried 
to present in this volume.

  CHAPTER XVIII 
READING AS A LEISURE OCCUPATION 
Pruaotive man had a considerable variety of leisure oc- 
cupations. But it appears that the one to which he gave 
the greatest amount of time and attention was observation 
of the men and things that made up the restricted world 
in which he lived and moved. As he went about through 
the little community he kept watch upon his associates, 
their actions, dress, property, living conditions, habits, 
manners and customs: also upon animals, plants, climatic 
conditions, natural phenomena, the heavenly bodies, etc. 
As he acted upon and reacted to many of them, his knowl- 
edge was further increased through various sense-channels. 
What he could not observe directly, he observed through 
the medium of language. Listening to another’s report is 
one kind of seeing. When the constitutents of situations 
are familiar, it makes relatively little difference in under- 
standing, whether one observes directly through the eyes 
of sense or indirectly through the eyes of language. 
Primitive man was motivated to this direct and indirect 
observation in part by his serious purposes; but in large 
part simply by his interest in things in general. In the 
latter there was no conscious purpose of putting his knowl- 
edge to practical use. In fact, he could not judge the value 
of the information until he had apprehended it. It was 
mainly a leisure activity; and leaving aside the purely 
physical, it was probably by far his most important leisure 
occupation. 
Nature’s purpose in providing so adequately for this 
leisure occupation is clear. The man had to move and act 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 THE CURRICULUM 
within this circle of things and forces and influences, and 
to shape his conduct to them all. In the unexpected muta- 
tions of human affairs he never could know with which of 
the many things he was to be concerned. He had to be 
watchful of the whole pageant of community affairs in order 
to be prepared for the specific adjustments that conditions 
should demand. Interrelations and interdependencies were 
innumerable. Rightly to know any part required that one 
know the whole, and through this all its parts. The most 
useful thing was an adequate vision of the total pageant of 
community life and of the conditioning setting or back- 
ground. 
Our interest is in twentieth-century civilized life. We 
began with primitive life because of the obviousness of the 
relations. For modern life also this observation of human 
affairs is certainly the most important non-physical leisure 
occupation; but for our time it has an enormously larger 
function to perform. Instead of our being the denizens of 
a community covering only a few square miles, we are citi- 
zens of a world-community. To move with understanding 
to-day and to see adequately all of the things with which 
one has vital relation and responsibility, one needs ade- 
quate and continuous vision of the whole world-pageant. 
Were man’s youth sufficiently long and the facilities of 
travel sufficiently cheap and abundant, he might travel 
through the world and familiarize himself with it as did 
primitive youth in his smaller community. For effective- 
ness of education he needs to come into contact with essen- 
tial realities the world over. And the most vital contact 
is the direct. Were it possible, he should visit all parts of 
the world and observe men and women in all of their affairs. 
He should participate in all types of activities: in the voca- 
tions, the recreations, the social and civic affairs, etc. And 
he should talk with all social classes concerning their affairs.
-P-A-G-E-237
  READING AS A LEISURE OCCUPATION 229 
More than anything else, this experience would give him 
much-needed world-understanding and sympathies. 
But the physical limitations are insuperable. Only a 
small fragment of such experience is possible even for indi- 
viduals most favored: whether for the original observations 
of youth or for the continuing observations of adulthood. 
Even could they travel as widely they could see only the 
present; not the past. And they need nowadays to see 
both, rightly to see the present; for we are a part of the 
whole interlinked series of generations. They must there- 
fore do most of their seeing of things past and distant 
through language, mainly reading. 
Our discussion thus far is designed to indicate what man 
should read. Obviously it is that which will present to 
him a full and adequate revelation of the vast human 
drama in which he plays his part; and of the stage upon 
which it is enacted and by which conditioned. It is to en- 
able him to “‘see life steadily and see it whole.” 
The general program is the same for childhood, youth, 
and adulthood, differing only in so far as demanded by the 
differing stages of maturity. Just as within the primitive 
community the child of ten viewed, so far as his maturity 
would permit, the totality of community affairs, so within 
the life of to-day the child of ten will, in his readings, so 
far as his maturity permits, view the affairs of his immeas- 
urably wider community. As the fifteen-year-old or twenty- 
one-year-old youth of that day continued to look upon the 
same community affairs acquiring greater depth of un- 
derstanding, greater knowledge of details, increased in- 
sight into relationships and values, so through reading will 
the fifteen- and twenty-one-year-old youth of our day sim- 
ply continue his observations of the world-situation for 
greater depth and generality of understanding. Adulthood 
will push on farther, continuing the same theme.
-P-A-G-E-238
230 THE CURRICULUM 
In that early day, learning was experiential. Men were 
not consciously learning or memorizing facts. They lived; 
and the mind was filled with memories, the normal residua 
of experience. And generalized understanding like the 
trunk and branches of a tree simply grew up imperceptibly 
and unconsciously so as to constitute the relatively un- 
changing fundamentals of their mental life, while the decid- 
uous foliage of their transient experiences came and went. 
In our day, original human nature is relatively unchanged. 
We have no reason to think that there is possible any new 
form of education that can be an improvement upon the 
experiential education of the past. New conditions demand 
adaptations, adjustment of proportions, the use of new 
and improved instruments, etc.; but at bottom as indi- 
cated by all of our progressive recent movements in edu- 
cation, it is still felt that experiential education constitutes 
the best training for the individual. If the principle holds, 
then the purpose of the reading is the reconstruction of ex- 
perience. It is to be a mode of living. It is not to be a didac- 
tic verbal presentation of unrooted facts and generaliza- 
tions to be memorized, recited upon, examined upon, and 
then in due process forgotten; leaving little more than the 
unwholesome residua of disagreeable learning experience. 
If the purposes are to be accomplished as fully for civi- 
lized man in the midst of civilized conditions as they were 
for primitive man among primitive conditions, then the 
readings from the beginning to the end of the course, to the 
end of life itself, need to be as wide and varied as earthly 
life and to give an adequate revelation of all major types 
of human experience, in all portions of the world, and with 
such historical perspective as is needed for each of the va- 
rious regions. And what is more, it must look not merely 
to the tangible and easily apprehended things of sense, but 
also to the intangible forces, influences, and relations with- 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  READING AS A LEISURE OCCUPATION 231 
out a vision of which the more tangible things are often 
meaningless. The intangibles are also portions of reality. 
We can now particularize the reading program. First it 
will present a revelation of man in his present dispersion 
over a diversified planet. Such readings we classify as trav- 
els, geography, ethnology, descriptive sociology, anthro- 
pology, ete. A second series of readings will reconstruct 
the historical background. These will include biography, 
travels (during past ages), history, memoirs, evolution- 
ary sociology, etc. Coming under both of the classes men- 
tioned there will be such sub-classes as industrial read- 
ings, commercial readings, civic and sanitary readings, 
ete. A third type of readings will reveal the essential na- 
tures and relations of things: science readings, mathe- 
matical, physical, biological, sociological, technological, ete. 
All of the fundamental sciences need to be read, — natu- 
rally in connection with direct contacts, —as modes of 
viewing the nature of the world in which we are called upon 
to act. A fourth type of reading is literature, in the nar- 
rower sense. It aims to present anything that happens 
to be chosen as its theme. This may be a single historical 
incident, a whole historical movement, a single human 
relation, an interconnected series of relations, the biog- 
raphy of an animal, an aspect of the inorganic world, the 
nature of immortality, or anything else, tangible or intan- 
gible, near or remote, real or mythical, that may enter into 
human experience. Clearly literature is not codrdinate with 
the others. It cannot be separated from them. Good lit- 
erature in its narrower sense appears simply to be the ade- 
quate presentation of any of them. 
Let us note some of the more detailed implications, be- 
ginning with the geography. In the primary and inter- 
mediate grades in addition to the widest practicable direct 
observations, there will be stories about things that make 
   
-P-A-G-E-240
  232 THE CURRICULUM 
up the world in general. Much must be oral; but beyond 
the first grades most of the stories will be read. The book- 
trade is rapidly providing suitable books. Here are a few 
titles taken at random: Litile Folks of Many Lands, Eskimo 
Stories, Around the World, The Wide World, Big and Little 
People in Other Lands, The Dutch Twins, The Japanese 
Twins, Little Journeys to China and Japan, Travels in Scot- 
land, Gerda in Sweden, etc. The more literary the stories 
can be, in the sense of presenting a true and clear and in- 
teresting reconstruction of life and its background in the 
various regions, the better for the educational experience. 
The readings offered at present have largely been devel- 
oped in an educational age of didacticism and fact-memori- 
zation, and are often so freighted with information that they 
do not reconstruct life so that it can be visualized, and re- 
lived in imagination. Many books, however, particularly 
the more recent, have avoided the pitfalls and fallacies of 
didacticism. They simply present interesting stories that 
comply with literary canons. They give no appearance of 
an attempt to be “informing.” They are presented upon 
the sane theory that if children are permitted to enter 
vividly into the life of a country and view conditions 
as they are, they will have intelligence enough to see the 
things that are there, and to carry away a sufficient resid- 
uum of memories. 
These readings upon the earlier levels should reveal the 
fundamental aspects of life over the earth. A reconstruc- 
tion of Eskimo life, for example, should permit the children 
to see the nature of the houses, the furniture, the mode of 
heating and lighting, the nature of the clothing, the food- 
supply, the occupations of the people, the recreations, the 
religion, the nature of their villages, their transportation, 
the thrilling adventures at times met with, the climate, 
land and water forms, lengths of day and night, the aurora
-P-A-G-E-241
  READING AS A LEISURE OCCUPATION 233 
borealis, plant and animal life, the nature of family life, the 
education of the children, etc. The reading should not call 
attention to these things specifically and consciously. As 
a drama upon the stage, it should simply present the re- 
constructed life and let the children do their own seeing and 
understanding. This will be superficial for some of the 
things; and this is normal for little children. As they look 
at corresponding things in their own community, they see 
them with the same superficiality and incompleteness of 
understanding. One of the most mischievous superstitions 
of education has been that when a thing is presented it 
must be completely understood. Really normality of ex- 
perience upon all levels results in a full-knowledge of some 
things, a half-knowledge of other things, a quarter-knowl- 
edge of still other things, and the merest fragmentary im- 
pressions of still other things. Experiential training expects 
these normal differences; is suspicious of the normality of 
the experience if they are absent. 
For the grammar grades, it is the same world-pageant 
that is to be observed by way of further deepening and 
extending their understanding and sympathies. They too 
will read accounts that permit them adequately to visual- 
ize life in its totality in the various lands. These are to be 
selected for their more mature understanding, however, 
and should reveal a wealth of details and relationships not 
possible on the earlier levels. The stories require for ef- 
fectiveness in the reconstructions the same types of literary 
merit; and absence of didacticism. If children do not ac- 
quire this habit of world-wide observation of human affairs 
during school days when the instincts are most fully awake 
as a healthy and satisfying leisure occupation, they are 
not likely to continue it during the years of adulthood. 
It is this continuance at which education should princi- 
pally aim. This is immeasurably more important at this
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 THE CURRICULUM 
period than the memorization of deciduous information. 
But it will take care of the information, — and on the 
sound presumption that most of it normally is deciduous. 
Let them develop their appreciations and their habit of 
world-observation as a satisfying leisure occupation, and 
the amount of genuine information they will have on tap 
will be enormously increased. And when they need other 
information they know how to acquire it expeditiously. 
But let them during grammar grades simply be dosed with 
didactic facts, then when adulthood is reached, they will 
neither have the facts remembered, — except where the 
learning was accidentally experiential, — nor those habits 
of observation of world-wide affairs which should consti- 
tute the most important non-physical leisure occupation 
of adulthood. 
Unfortunately the major portion of the books supplied 
for grammar-grade levels are heavily didactic and imper- 
fectly fitted for experiential education. But there is now a 
clear movement away from the verbal-fact-learning method. 
Whereas a few years ago in progressive school systems, the 
textbook was the basis of the training with the so-called 
supplementary books merely inessential collateral read- 
ings, at the present time the geographical readers are com- 
ing to be the basis of the training with the standard text- 
book relegated to the position of reference-book or atlas. 
The more recent geographical readers make a more ade- 
quate attempt to reconstruct living experiences within the 
various lands and less to presenting merely strings of facts. 
More and more there is revealed a tendency to read vivid 
narratives of travel such as the Cruise of the Cachalot, Two 
Years before the Mast, Darwin’s Voyage of the Beagle, Lost 
in the Jungle, The Land of the Long Night, The Peeps at 
Many Lands Series, Adventures of Two Youths in Ceylon and 
India, Boy Travellers in Australia, Around the World in the
-P-A-G-E-243
  READING AS A LEISURE OCCUPATION 235 
Sloop Spray, How I Found Livingstone, Through the Dark 
Continent, etc. A still further step is the increasing use of 
readings that are ostensibly literary with no didactic pur- 
pose, but which at the same time present illuminating re- 
constructions of some region or important life-situation; 
such as Heidi, Lizbeth Longfrock, The Young Ice-Whalers, 
etc. 
The best basis for that geographical problem-solving 
which we are coming to think should constitute a very 
large portion of the training experience of the children in 
this field, is effective contact with essential realities. The 
more vital the contacts, the better the foundation laid for 
the problem-solving. It may appear at first glance that 
in urging reading experiences of the type herein described 
and in introducing interest and vividness of concrete 
impressions, we are falling into the error against which we 
are so often cautioned of making educational experience 
too soft and easy. As a matter of fact we are urging the 
kind of experience required by the demands of those 
hard-headed practical men who insist that education shall 
result from the most vital contact possible with essential 
realities. They are very clear as to what these contacts 
must be within one’s local environment: direct observa- 
tion, practical participation, and the like. We are here 
only saying that that portion of the world which lies 
beyond the horizon is also to be given the greatest possible 
degree of reality in the minds of the children. Abstract 
didacticism does not give them this sense of reality. A half- 
page exposition of the cod-fishing industry, for example, 
off the banks of Newfoundland gives the children no es- 
sential realization of the nature of that industry. Let them, 
however, read Kipling’s Captains Courageous, and thus in- 
directly participate in the various activities and experi- 
ences of the fishing fleet off Newfoundland, and they will 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
236 THE CURRICULUM 
have come into contact with that type of human experi- 
ence almost as efficaciously as if they had been actually 
upon the waters. Let them in the same vivid way travel 
in spirit across the wide plains of Russia, up the rivers of 
China, through the jungles of Africa or Brazil, across the 
Polar ice-fields, with the ore-fleets of the United States 
Steel Corporation, live upon the cotton plantations of the 
South, the great wheat farms of the Northwest, in the timber 
regions of Georgia and Oregon, etc., — let them thus know 
realities from vital contacts with them and only then are 
they prepared for the geographical problem-solving which 
should develop an understanding of the more general in- 
fluences, forces, and relationships. Experiential educa- 
tion aims at the greatest possible educational efficiency, 
substantiality, and practicality of result. It employs in- 
terest for the sake of vividness and massiveness of experi- 
ence; not for the sake of pleasantness. It uses pleasantness 
as a means; not as an end. 
The story does not end with the grammar grades. The 
geographical program of the past has aimed so little at this 
adult leisure occupation, that it has tended to stop at the 
end of the seventh grade. But looked at from the point of 
view of purposes, it seems clear that this type of experience 
should continue throughout one’s entire training. It is not 
possible to develop habits and appreciations needed for 
adulthood in the first seven grades, and then leave them in 
storage unused for years until taken by up the adult. They 
will not be there. The only practicable way is for high 
school and college to continue this indirect observational 
experience through readings appropriate to their higher 
levels of mental maturity. There will be increased atten- 
tion to forces, the subtler relations, and general principles. 
But mere verbal didacticism apart from essential contacts 
with reality is no more appropriate for these levels than
-P-A-G-E-245
  READING AS A LEISURE OCCUPATION 237 
for the lower; and will no more lead to the adult habits 
desired. A habit is to be acquired in the way it is later to 
be exercised. If life-long observation of the practical reali- 
ties of the world is to be the habit, then during adolescent 
years it is a continuing observation of concrete realities 
that will develop the habit. The thing that is to be con- 
tinuous throughout life should obviously be continuous 
throughout education. 
The limitations of space forbid discussion here of the 
reading programs of history and of science. But for both, 
there is the same major purpose, and controlling principles. 
The present ferment in both fields presages far-reaching 
changes. The studies have not been organized as conscious 
means of training for this intellectual leisure occupation. 
The purpose itself is yet scarcely recognized as legitimate. 
Let us now turn to literature, in the narrower sense. 
Since we are here dealing with the leisure occupation of 
world-observation through reading, good literature for the 
purpose is obviously that which presents adequate and 
effective vicarious opportunity. To be complete it is to 
provide not only for effective visualization but also for 
emotional reactions in the reader like those of the original 
observer and writer. The canons of literary discourse aim 
simply at effectiveness in the indirect or language-obser- 
vation method of viewing and experiencing reality. 
Now for developing the leisure occupation here dis- 
cussed, the literature to be selected is that which will give 
the widest and fullest and most effective possible revela- 
tion of the world as a whole in its multifarious divisions 
and aspects. Any selection will be chosen not upon the 
basis of literary form or structure; or nationality of the 
writer; or language in which he originally wrote; or of the 
age in which he lived; or recency of the selection; or fame 
of the author. It is simply a question of whether it presents
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 THE CURRICULUM 
a clear window through which one can look out upon ex- 
istence. If it does not, then it matters not how famous the 
author, or how difficult the selection, or what the wealth 
of footnotes, it cannot be good for the purpose here de- 
fined. 
This has profound significance for the curriculum. In 
the past we have tended to be provincial in our selec-” 
tions. The usual course of study in grammar grades and 
high school tends to include only the literature of English 
and American writers and to reveal little more than Eng- 
land, Scotland, and America; and little that is recent. The 
traditional courses have not, and have not consciously at- 
tempted, to present any adequate revelation of Russia, 
Switzerland, Norway, Japan, Brazil, and most of the other 
regions of the earth. The purpose has been not so much 
to reveal human life the world over as it has been to reveal 
types and technical characteristics of literature. When 
" special teachers of the subject are asked, What is the fun- 
damental purpose in the teaching of literature? the most 
frequent reply is, The appreciation of literature. Almost 
never do they say that it is an understanding and appre- 
ciation of human-kind and human affairs and the general 
setting of the great human drama. 
Acceptance of this latter purpose must work profound 
transformation in both spirit and content of the literature 
curriculum. Selections will be chosen for their content- 
value. They will aim at the greatest possible width of vision, 
historical perspective, and depth of insight. The curriculum 
will draw upon the literatures of all lands. For the purpose 
here stated, good translations are on par with English and 
American selections. The books of Homer, Virgil, the Old 
Testament, Dante, Balzac, Maeterlinck, Bjérnsen, Freytag, 
Fabre, Sienkiewicz, and Tolstoy must be considered por- 
tions of the total revelation that are just as vital and essen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  
READING AS A LEISURE OCCUPATION 239 
tial as those of Shakespeare, Scott, Dickens, Tennyson, 
Stevenson, or Joseph Conrad. 
The purpose demands catholicity of theme. The litera- 
ture should reveal war, personal adventure, love, brigandage, 
philanthropy, religion, travels, poverty, family life, com- 
merce, agriculture, industry, transportation, government, 
the struggle with nature and with disease, conflicting social 
classes, the labors of science and technology; and the other 
major ingredients of human existence. As literature rings 
the changes upon these things for different historical 
periods and in different portions of the world, its field is 
interminable and presents material for a rich and satisfying 
lifelong leisure occupation. It is the business of early edu- 
cation to start youth upon this inspiring program; to bring 
him to love it as he loves the simpler visual drama upon the 
stage or screen; to develop habits in this field that are satis- 
fying and permanent for the intellectual illumination of a 
life-time. 
For the purposes mentioned, men need #o use literature 
of different types and structures; but this does not require 
understanding of the technique of literary types and struc- 
tures. A man can use a watch for the human purposes of 
telling time without knowing the technique of the mechan- 
ism. In the same way, he can use literature for securing the 
revelation to which we have referred without knowing how 
it is made. 
The reading should be like witnessing a play at the the- 
ater. The play presents an illusion of human life. All that 
the spectator wants is this illusion. The more complete the 
illusion, the more successful the play. The man need know 
nothing about the various devices that were employed by 
the playwright in producing the effects. As a matter of 
fact, the more he knows about the technique of securing 
effects and the more he sees the stage machinery, the less is
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 THE CURRICULUM 
the play a real illusion of life. It becomes but a tissue of 
technical devices. The knowledge of the technique not only 
does not further the fundamental purpose of the play, it 
actually interferes and prevents. In the same way, an undue 
consciousness on the part of the reader as to technical liter- 
ary machinery not only does not further the fundamental 
purposes of the reading, but may actually hinder. 
Should the literary selections used for educational pur- 
poses be difficult? No, else clearness and vividness and im- 
mediacy of impression were not literary virtues. The more 
the literature facilitates the vision itself and the less it calls 
attention to itself the more suitable it is for the purposes. 
It is simply to say that a window of such clear glass that the 
glass itself is not seen is better for the purposes of vision than 
one which calls attention to itself. Or to resume our other 
illustration, the play upon the stage should be so written 
and presented as to involve no difficulty, no confusion, few 
or no allusions to things not generally known by the audi- 
ence. The witnesses must be able to take in the action as 
rapidly as it is presented. The play that fails is one that is 
obscure, confused, makes allusions to things that are not 
understood, or presents other types of difficulty. It is ob- 
vious that the literature which is used for inducing experi- 
ence in the reader should be of the same clear character. 
As a matter of fact, reading should be easy, rapid, inter- 
esting, so that much ground will be covered within the avail- 
able time and also so that it can be done chiefly because of 
inner motive. We cannot expect adults, even trained adults, 
to read things as leisure occupations which require constant 
or even frequent references to dictionaries, handbooks, or 
notes at the end of the volume. Children’s natures are even 
less adapted to any such machine-method of grinding 
through a piece of literature. In proportion as the thing 
is difficult and the reading slow, the pupil gets less of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-249
  READING AS A LEISURE OCCUPATION 241 
vision of things he ought to see. It fails to accomplish its 
purpose. And what is more, it fails to develop within him the 
much more permanent and fundamental things of apprecia- 
tions, and right attitudes of mind toward his reading, and 
right habits of using reading as a richly fructifying life-long 
leisure occupation. 
The way to make reading easy and rapid and pleasant is 
to have much reading from the first grade onward; an ever 
increasing quantity from grade to grade. Any selection that 
is so difficult as greatly to impede progress thereby proves 
that it belongs on a later level, and is to be prepared for by 
readings that grade upward to its degree of difficulty. There 
is evidence of insufficient preparatory reading if pupils have 
to refer frequently to dictionaries, handbooks, or literary 
notes. As a matter of fact, if the readings are properly 
chosen, and if they are sufficiently abundant, such growth 
of vocabulary should result that pupils should rarely have to 
refer to dictionaries in their reading. If they have difficulty 
with mythological and historical allusions, it means that 
they have not had that wealth of mythological and historical 
reading experiences which should precede and be considered 
a prerequisite to the readings that involve allusions to those 
things. A mythological handbook does not and cannot give 
one the true flavor of mythology and therefore the true 
spirit and significance of a mythological allusion; nor can a 
historical reference book do any better by the historical 
allusions. These things rightly to be known must be met 
with in their proper settings and relationships. 
In concluding this section let. us summarize. For the 
generality of men, literature is primarily a thing to be 
experienced, not a thing to be studied; to be used, not to 
be analyzed; to be pleasurable experience motivated from 
within, and not tasks arbitrarily imposed from without. 
The literature need not be old; neither need it be new. It
-P-A-G-E-250
  22 THE CURRICULUM 
need not be by authors who are dead; neither is there reason 
for holding mainly to authors who are living. It is not pri- 
marily to reveal literdry types; nor the characteristics of 
literary epochs. It need not be only by authors who have 
already become famous. It should be easy, rapidly read, 
and voluminous in amount. It should provide for lifting 
the reader to the higher levels of intellectual and esthetic 
experience. It should begin with fullness in the primary 
grades and continue with increasing fullness during gram- 
mar grades, high school, and college; and so provide for 
proper fullness during the continuing education of ma- 
turity. It should present world-literature, not merely that 
of the English tongue. It should be all-inclusive in its 
revelation, so far as human finitude and fragmentariness 
will permit, rather than a revelation of scant and partial 
aspects. It should present the full human drama and the 
stage upon which it is enacted. 
Along with the provision of a rich and appropriate read- 
ing opportunity, there is the equally vital problem of pro- 
viding a teacher who can rightly lead and guide this 
reading experience. The qualified teacher is one who loves 
reading, and who daily uses it in the renewal of his own vi- 
sion; who has world-outlook, world-sympathies, a quickened 
interest in the varied affairs of mankind; who values ez- 
perience as a trainer of youth over and above memorization 
of facts; who is a condition-setter and an influence rather 
than a memorization-task-master; who knows the tastes 
and interests and loves of the child’s unfolding spirit at 
each level of maturation so well that he can divine the 
reading experiences most effective for awakening and exer- 
cising and shaping the child; who can withhold his hand 
in patience until the time is ripe, and then can subtly and 
unsuspectedly crowd the experiences needed for the child’s 
unfoldment as the flood-tide of awakening interest reaches
-P-A-G-E-251
  READING AS A LEISURE OCCUPATION 23 
its crest and before the ebb has set in; who feels that his 
responsibility is to the children, —and to the unfolding 
men and women within the children, —rather than to 
syllabi and programs and textbooks and time-schedules; 
who knows how to use system and organization for effec- 
tiveness and economy, and yet keep the elements of spon- 
taneity and freedom of choice as to kinds and places and 
amounts of experience; who knows a better way of manag- 
ing child-experience than those who say arbitrarily to the 
children that at 9.00 o’clock to-morrow you shall experi- 
ence thus and so, at 9.30 to-morrow you shall experience 
such and such a second thing, at 10.00 to-morrow your 
experience shall be of this third type, and who thus me- 
chanically grinds out child-experiences through days and 
weeks and months of dreary drudgery. 
So long has our profession taught that we think the only 
way to educate is to teach. We have not sufficiently known 
that to live will also educate. We have been busy providing 
the conditions for teaching. Only recently are we coming 
to know how to provide the conditions for living. Both 
have a place; and the main thing is living.

CHAPTER XIX 
THE MOTHER-TONGUE 
Lavine aside the physical, man’s activities are primarily 
social; and the mother-tongue is man’s primary instrument 
of social intercourse and intercommunication. It is also the 
principal vehicle of his thought. It may be said that he 
needs to use it just well enough to get on with his fellows. 
If he can understand and make himself understood, and if 
he can do his thinking well enough in whatever quality of 
language he may have developed, then nothing else greatly 
matters. It would appear, however, that an instrument 
which is used almost continuously throughout one’s waking 
hours for thought and communication, and throughout one’s 
entire lifetime, should be a good instrument for the purpose, 
not a crude cheap one; and that it should be well understood 
and appreciated in order that it be carefully and intelli- 
gently used. The motor-car that one uses for recreation one 
prefers to be of good design, clean, properly finished, quiet, 
smooth-running. One is not satisfied with just anything 
that willrun. One’s clothing we feel should be of good design 
and color, clean and not displeasing to others; not just any- 
thing, regardless of others, that will keep one warm. In the 
same way, one’s language which is more intimately related 
to one’s life than either of these things and which is a perma- 
nent possession, not one that is changed frequently, should 
also be of good design, correct, polished, accurate and 
socially pleasing; not just anything that will crudely express 
crude thought. 
It is generally recognized that the major training in the 
mother-tongue is obtained in one’s general social and lan- 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 THE CURRICULUM 
guage experience. In listening, talking, thinking, reading 
and writing, one uses the mother-tongue of the social class 
in which one moves; and thereby masters it. In the main he 
will rise without teaching to the standard of correctness 
that is set by the language of his social group. Here and 
there he may need a little help in the grammar and compo- 
sition, and somewhat more help in his start in the artificial 
language forms involved in reading, writing and spelling. 
But if he is to be educated only for the language-life of the 
group in which he moves, this additional curriculum of 
conscious training usually need not be large. 
We feel however that the language-life of most social 
groups is on a lower plane than it should be; that the lan- 
guage abilities are inadequate for the language activities 
demanded by the thought and action of a thoroughly human- 
ized democracy. It is felt that the intelligence demanded 
requires a type of language fitted to higher, more subtle and 
more complicated types of thought; and that the social 
agreeableness and mutual understanding of all classes 
within a democracy demands a more or less uniform level 
of language excellence on the part of all people. This does 
not mean uniformity of type; but uniform elimination of 
crudeness, or what we may term language-inefficiency. 
Since the language-efficiency of all is to be raised to a 
level above that of most, education is clearly here to be an 
agency of social progress. It is not only to eliminate the 
language weaknesses found in children as these are meas- 
ured in terms of their adult group, but as measured by a 
standard above that of their group. 
Scientific curriculum-making has probably been more 
fully developed in this field than in any other; though as 
yet only in its beginnings. Grammar investigators in many 
cities have been discovering the actual grammatical short- 
comings; and on the basis of these, drawing up studies and 
  | 
|
-P-A-G-E-257
  THE MOTHER-TONGUE 249 
other experiences for the purpose of eliminating the gram- 
matical deficiencies. Throughout the country, investigators 
are drawing up lists of words commonly misspelled or mis- 
pronounced; the types of composition weakness; kinds of 
errors commonly made in handwriting, oral and silent read- 
ing, etc. These are diagnoses of conditions by way of dis- 
covering the particular objectives of conscious training. 
Beyond this point of locating the objectives, scientific 
investigations have not yet gone far. The series of pupil- 
experiences that are prescribed for attaining the objectives 
are usually based upon nothing better than the current edu- 
cational hypotheses that have grown up out of practice. 
It is probable that actual procedure often looks too ex- 
clusively to the particular errors to be prevented or cor- 
rected, and insufficiently to the deeper roots of those errors. 
In correcting or preventing grammatical errors, it is more 
important that one ardently desire to use correct English 
than that he memorize all the necessary technical informa- 
tion or have all of his errors pointed out to him. Unless edu- 
cation can first develop this desire, all other more direct 
efforts must remain futile. Education here must therefore 
aim primarily at fundamental valuations, appreciations of 
good language, a critical attitude toward and watchfulness 
over one’s language, a social ambition to use language that 
is both effective and agreeable, a general social sensitiveness 
to linguistic errors and weaknesses of types that are to be 
eliminated, etc. These are particularized objectives just as 
fully as a list of commonly misspelled words; and far more 
fundamental. But for attaining these deeper objectives, 
both educational thought and technique are yet very un- 
certain. In the discussion that follows, unfortunately brief 
and general because of lack of space, we can present prob- 
abilities more frequently than certainties. 
1. The first educational task is to provide each child and
-P-A-G-E-258
  250 THE CURRICULUM 
youth with a rich and full language-life of the type desired. 
Let him hear as fully as possible the language of the kind he 
is to use, and the undesirable kinds as little as possible. Let 
him live abundantly in the rich fields of reading experience 
with language of desired types flowing through his conscious- 
ness and unconsciously moulding vocabulary, sentence- 
forms, and language thought-structures. Let him have 
diversified experience with realities through direct contacts, 
participation in action, observation, reading, etc., and at 
the same time the experience of verbalizing his experiences 
in conversation, discussion, oral and written report, both 
informal and formal. Give variety, reality, responsibility 
and substantiality to the non-linguistic experiences that 
make up his life; and provide the opportunities for the nor- 
mal language accompaniment. Make clear and adequate 
thought as to realities the central feature of his intellectual 
life; and language an adequate vehicle of this thought. The 
education that can provide these experiences will take care 
of practically all needed training in English. 
* Children and youths mainly need opportunities to live 
their language under rightly impelling conditions and cir- 
cumstances. There has been too much English teaching ; 
not enough English living. Even the overworked English 
teachers themselves admit that after having obtained the 
lion’s share of the curriculum for the English, their teach- 
ing is far from successful. And their remedy: We must 
have still more time. Give it to them, and they will soon be 
asking for yet more. They have command over the ma- 
chinery of teaching; but over most of the conditions of a full 
language-life, they have no more command than other de- 
partments. Language-teaching is a matter of adjusting the 
whole range of educational experiences, and paralleling them 
with the verbal element. The ordinary English teaching 
relates to only partial aspects of this total experience.
-P-A-G-E-259
THE MOTHER-TONGUE 251 
2. The major training that comes from living a language- 
life that parallels and verbalizes one’s other experiences will 
fall short at many points when not supplemented by con- 
scious training. Let an individual have the richest language- 
experience, he will be found making certain kinds of gram- 
matical errors, misspelling and mispronouncing certain 
words, and making other types of linguistic error. The cur- 
_ Ticulum of conscious training for each individual will have 
as its end the elimination of these errors. This means that 
for one pupil the curriculum will be long; for another, short; 
all depending on the length of the list of his errors. It means 
that the conscious curriculum in English will not be the 
same for any two pupils in the same class; that a uniform 
English curriculum is unthinkable. There is no more sanity 
in it than in a uniform treatment of all cases that enter a 
hospital. 
A variety of agencies may be enlisted in discovering the 
curriculum objectives for each pupil. Fairly early in the 
course the pupil himself can be set at the task of drawing 
up his own error-lists for spelling, pronunciation, concord, 
verb-forms, handwriting, sentence-structure, composition- 
structure, etc. His labors here need to be brought to the 
work-level as speedily and completely as possible. This 
requires that he be conscious of the ends to be reached. His 
own effort in defining those ends is a necessary portion of 
the process of developing this understanding and sense of 
responsibility. 
Pupil-committees for each subject will serve in relays in 
keeping tab upon all English errors of every type made by 
each individual of the class; and make contributions to the 
individual error-lists of each pupil. Watchfulness over the 
speech of others is a more objective process than the sub- 
jective watchfulness over one’s own speech; it is therefore 
a good preparation for self-watchfulness. It is easier to 
   
-P-A-G-E-260
252 THE CURRICULUM 
develop a critical attitude toward errors when they are seen 
in others than when seen in one’s self; this can then be gen- 
eralized and made to apply to one’s own errors. Such pupil- 
committee work can be wholly unobtrusive, and yet effec- 
tive for a variety of purposes. It is a necessary ingredient of 
training the pupils who do it; not merely a means of re- 
lieving the teacher of diagnostic labors. 
Where pupil-errors go undiscovered by both the pupil 
himself and the committees, the teacher will extend the lists 
by adding any others that he may have noted. 
3. After the pupil has his list of errors, and his knowl- 
edge of the right forms to be substituted, the next thing is 
that he want to make the substitutions. The pupil is the 
only individual that can do this. His will must therefore be 
awakened. This is not a thing that can be normally accom- 
plished through preaching, persuasion, threats, coercion, or 
setting of lessons and drill exercises. Language is a social 
process; the awakening is to be secured through those social 
stimulations that normally incite one to watchfulness over 
his language, and which produce chagrin or mortification 
when his language goes astray. It is a sensitive linguistic 
conscience, one type of social conscience, that will hold 
him in the paths of rectitude and prick him to effort at 
return to grace when he finds himself fallen into trans- 
gression. 
To assert that such linguistic conscience is beyond chil- 
dren is but to confess that one does not know children. The 
boy who is chagrined when his teacher makes him use “big 
words” and bookish English, is simply reacting to the lin- 
pitta conscience which at the moment happens to rule 
within the boy-group of which he is a member. He hates to 
be laughed at — that is to say, condemned — by his fellows 
for using a form of English not sanctioned by the conscience 
of his group.
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE MOTHER-TONGUE 253 
The problem of making a boy want to use good English is, 
therefore, a problem of making his fellows expect him to use 
good English, and condemn him if he does not. The problem 
of training the boy is one of training those to whom he 
reacts. It is to reach him indirectly. The task is to make the 
society of which he is a part genuinely critical of his lan- 
guage. This is not to say that they must be vocal, and rudely 
point out to him his errors. This will but awaken contrary 
reactions in him. It is his consciousness of their unspoken 
condemnation of his failings that is most effective, and 
which should be the usual thing, — his own consciousness 
voicing the social conscience and the social condemnation. 
This does not excite contrary reactions in him, but rather 
fires him to purge his language of its faults. 
The problem, therefore, is how to bring the whole class sin- 
cerely to condemn improper English in any of its forms of 
impropriety. The task appears to have both positive and 
negative aspects. Noting the latter first, pupils are to be 
made critical of improper English in others. The pupil- 
committee tasks of drawing up lists of pupil-errors in current 
oral and written expression is an effective method of doing 
this. One who has had extended experience in proof-reading, 
or in reading student-papers, can appreciate the critical 
linguistic conscience thereby developed. 
On the positive side, there is the problem of developing 
clarity, accuracy, and orderliness of thinking; and the con- 
sequent parallel qualities of language. One so trained tends 
to condemn slovenliness and obscurity of thought and ex- 
pression. This positive program is a matter to be taken 
care of by all teachers who have to do with thought as an 
aspect of the training; and this means practically all depart- 
ments. 
Thus far we have discussed mainly the expression side of 
the English. This leaves the problem of the receptive side |

of language — listening and reading. Listening is so com- 
pletely instinctive that it does not have to be taught. The 
way to learn to listen is simply to listen. Reading is the 
visual analogue of listening. In the purely visual part of it, 
it is not impelled by instinct, and requires careful setting of 
conditions and stimulations by teachers. But at bottom the 
method is the same as for listening. One learns to read by 
reading. Children will listen and easily learn to listen when 
the things appeal to them; equally, after once getting a little 
start, they will read and thereby learn to read, when pre- 
sented with things that appeal to them. The problem of 
curriculum-making for the single purpose of mastering the 
mechanics of reading is mainly the provision of an abun- 
dance of interesting reading matter for each grade, adapted 
to the maturity of the pupils, and graded upward by such 
easy stages that the pupil can do abundant and rapid read- 
ing, usually silent, without being slowed down by difficulty 
of language or thought. Every pupil of the first grade should 
have easy and continuous access to not fewer than two or 
three dozen appealing books; and each grade beyond, an 
ever-increasing number. Teachers will then find ways of 
awakening interests, stimulating enthusiasms, getting the 
pupils started into books; and then leave the children to 
enter normally, and to lose themselves normally, in the 
living experiences of reading.

  CHAPTER XX 
TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 
Waar are the specific mistakes or shortcomings or forms 
of arrested development that result in our country from a 
lack of knowledge of foreign languages? 
If there are no important deficiencies that result from 
failure to master one or more foreign languages, then there 
is no need for including them at public expense in the cur- 
riculum. If, on the other hand, there are serious resulting 
defects, then the nature of the deficiencies will point to the 
foreign language training that will prevent such undesirable 
results. 
In order to avoid the pitfalls into which both the protag- 
onists and the antagonists of foreign languages are prone 
to fall, we must particularize the problems. What are the 
deficiencies in one’s performance of the labors of his calling 
that result from lack of knowledge of foreign languages? 
This question has to be separately put for each occupational 
class and for each grade of labor from the simplest routine 
levels up to the most complicated professional levels. Then 
the questions continue through other fields. What are the 
defects in civic performance that are due to an inadequate 
understanding of foreign languages? What are the defi- 
ciencies of personal hygiene and community sanitation that 
result from a lack of knowledge of foreign languages? What 
are the aspects of family life that are generally or frequently 
suffering because of the inadequacy of training in foreign 
languages? What are the shortcomings in the moral and 
religious life that are due to an insufficient knowledge of 
foreign languages? What desirable leisure occupations are
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 THE CURRICULUM 
faulty or seriously insufficient because of a lack of knowl- 
edge of foreign languages? What are the specific defects in 
our use of our mother-tongue which result chiefly or largely 
from ignorance of foreign languages and which can be cor- 
rected most effectively and economically through the mas- 
tery of such languages? 
The problems need to be particularized in another direc- 
tion. Are men to be trained for a speaking or only a reading 
knowledge of the language? The curriculum for the latter 
purpose alone will be fundamentally different from the one 
demanded by the first. While reading will be a large element 
in the first case, the principal element must be speaking. 
Classes must be small, meetings frequent, and much time 
and labor given to grammar and composition. In the second 
case there need be only a little speaking in the beginning for 
giving pronunciation and certain language-imagery. The 
chief need will be an abundant supply of fascinating reading 
materials, so graded in degree of difficulty that after a start 
has been made, the gradient of vocabulary, word-forms, 
sentence-forms, etc., is so imperceptible that through full- 
ness of reading without much help from teachers or diction- 
aries or grammars the individual can attain reading pro- 
ficiency. In this latter case classes may well be large and 
class meetings infrequent. 
Languages needed for occupational efficiency 
The problems suggested are so numerous and complex 
that we can here touch upon only a few of the more funda- 
mental. Let us look first to the occupational values of the 
foreign languages. The occupational argument is the one 
most urged by our colleges in the case of modern languages; 
and the college influences the lower schools. The argument 
takes several forms. One is that all college men and women 
must read the technical literature of their specialties in the
-P-A-G-E-265
  TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 257 
foreign languages in sufficient degree to justify the expend- 
iture of some years of preparatory language-training for the 
purpose. Since the high schools do not know which of their 
students are going on to college, they proceed to require 
the foreign languages of everybody; and so far as this voca- 
tional argument is dominant, they encourage the modern 
languages. The second occupational argument is commer- 
cial and clerical. Business houses need clerks, correspond- 
ents and agents for foreign fields who are thoroughly convers- 
ant with the foreign languages involved. In other cases it is 
urged that foreign languages should be taught for the pro- 
motion of the business interests of immigrant communities. 
For the occupational argument, let us make the matter 
concrete by taking the case of the teaching profession. There 
are upwards of six hundred thousand elementary and sec- 
ondary teachers. As completely as any other profession, 
theirs requires fullness of knowledge, width of outlook, and 
ability to handle complex problems. Now what are the short- 
comings in teaching ability that are due mainly to a lack of 
knowledge of foreign languages? When one goes for answer 
directly to the teacher’s work or to the testimony of special- 
ists, one finds enumerated many kinds of teaching defi- 
ciency; but not one of them appears to be strictly and inevit- 
ably due to a lack of knowledge of modern languages. As 
one reads the judgments of superintendents, principals, 
normal-school presidents and training-school directors as 
to the causes of teaching deficiency, one does not find them 
mentioning ignorance of modern languages as one of the 
causes. If it were a major source of weakness, or even mod- 
erately important, it would be discovered by some of them. 
In a former chapter we discussed the need of the workers 
in any field keeping abreast of progressive technical dis- 
coveries and developments anywhere throughout the world. 
Education is a field of the widest kind of experimentation in
-P-A-G-E-266
EE _LOE 
258 THE CURRICULUM 
all progressive countries. The teacher therefore should 
obtain ideas concerning any important advance in educa- 
tional thought or technique wherever it is being made, 
whether in the United States, in Canada, in Great Britain, 
France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzer- 
land, Italy, Russia, Japan, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Aus- 
tralia or New Zealand— to mention countries where prog- 
ress is being made. Also the teacher needs the professional 
stimulation and width of outlook that comes from feeling 
himself a member of the world-wide professional group. 
This can result only from vital contacts, mainly through 
socializing reading, with the profession throughout the 
world. 
Another equally valid statement is that they should em- 
ploy economical methods in securing this technical and 
socializing information. Time and money at present are 
needed for so many things that they must not be wasted 
where more economical methods can be found. And what 
is more, the technical and social needs require that the 
things be carried through effectively and not in a perfunc- 
tory and slip-shod manner. With these generally admitted 
presumptions in mind, let us look at the situation. 
There are two conceivable ways of accomplishing this 
aspect of teacher-training. One method is to teach the lan- 
guages of all of the countries enumerated — about ten lan- 
guages in all — then to expect the teachers in training, in 
colleges and normal schools, to get their technical and 
socializing information from the reading of the original 
literature in the various languages; and further to expect 
them in some yet undiscovered way to secure the current 
literature of these various lands in the towns where they 
teach and look through it in order to find the portions that 
can be helpful for the purposes enumerated. The other pos- 
sible plan is that which for some years has been developing

12. Demand for vocational education in the countries at war. 10. 
While this work of the Bureau is not yet sufficiently devel- 
oped, it already goes much beyond the demands of the pro- 
fession in general for the technical and socializing informa- 
tion. Let there be a widespread and clearly-voiced demand 
for a still more adequate bulletin literature, and the Bureau 
can soon supply all professional needs. It will be necessary 
to employ a few specialists each of whom has a thorough 
knowledge of the needs of teachers in our own country and 
an equally thorough knowledge of the educational condi- 
tions in the foreign land upon which he is to report. The 
knowledge of the foreign language, the foreign education, 
and its professional literature, needs largely to be acquired 
by these specialists upon the grounds. It is by living within 
a foreign land at least half the time and as a life-long 
vocation that such workers will be enabled to give effective 
examination to all of the work that is to be reported upon;  
-P-A-G-E-268
  260 THE CURRICULUM 
and to make effective choice of just the things that American 
teachers need. Only through vital contacts with both sides 
can investigators make rational selection of technical facts; 
or prepare effective socializing readings. 
The foreign language method is highly expensive in time 
and money. And for the two professional purposes men- 
tioned, except in the case of a few specialists, it is wholly 
ineffective. To teachers in general the foreign literature is 
inaccessible; it is not written from the point of view of their 
needs; it is voluminous, discursive, fragmentary, confused. 
Teachers have not time to read a tenth of our own over- 
discursive professional literature, much less that of foreign 
lands. They scarcely have time to read the latter when it is 
carefully selected and organized for them by specialists 
familiar with their needs, and put into English, 
This is not to deny the necessity of the foreign languages 
for a few hundred professional research workers. Quite ob- 
viously those engaged in searching through the literature of 
foreign countries for the sake of finding the technical or 
other information needed for immediate application or for 
dissemination through our own country must have the lan- 
guages of the countries from which the facts are drawn. This 
justifies the foreign languages for strictly professional pur- 
poses for perhaps one in a thousand. It is too expensive a 
method to require the same of the other 999 in order that 
the one be accommodated. 
In discussing the situation of teachers at such length it 
has been our intention to reveal the nature of the modern 
language situation as regards all of the professions. Let one 
examine medicine, engineering, finance, law, divinity, archi- 
tecture, music, art, journalism, politics, and the profes- 
sional levels of commerce, banking, transportation, agri- 
culture, mining, etc. He will find that the members of these 
professions also need technical and socializing information 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 261 
from all progressive countries of the world. But they too 
need to use effective and economical methods. Each needs a 
few highly specialized research workers who know the for- 
eign languages and who can bring to them in English the 
valuable things from all lands. 
Let one calculate the relative costs in either money or 
time of the two plans, and the one suggested will be found 
the more economical in a ratio of probably not less than a 
hundred to one. In degree of effectiveness for the profession 
as a whole its relative advantages must be even greater. 
When one looks to the rank and file of farmers, mechanics, 
miners, housewives, milliners, and all others below the pro- 
fessional level, one can discover reasons for vital contacts 
with their occupational confreres throughout the world. 
We are coming to be, and we think we ought to be, cosmo- 
politan-minded on all social levels. Men and women there- 
fore of all ranks and classes should read; but it is obvious 
that for effectiveness and economy the reading should be 
in the mother-tongue. It will be a hard enough task to get 
it done even through that easy medium. Unless specially 
situated, therefore, there seems to be no occupational 
reason for foreign languages for the millions of workers 
below the professional levels. 
It will be argued that commerce has international rela- 
tionships which involve other occupational needs than those 
mentioned. The large business houses having contact with 
foreign lands need correspondents, agents, and clerical 
workers who have a thorough familiarity with the language 
of the country with which the house is dealing. When they 
deal with Brazil their specialized employees must know 
Portuguese; when with Japan and China, it is Japanese and 
Chinese; with Russia, Russian, etc. 
In large measure the foreign agents, clerks, and corre- 
spondents will be native to the country itself. So far as
-P-A-G-E-270
262 THE CURRICULUM 
native — and the degree is an increasing one — there is no 
training problem for our schools. It is necessary, however, 
we are told, to have a certain percentage of native Americans 
for this work, especially as leaders. They need to be thor- 
oughly trained for the purpose. They need a high degree 
of proficiency in understanding, speaking, and writing the 
foreign tongue. To be effective they must know the turns 
of phrase, the subtleties of expression, the idioms and every- 
thing that is effective in making appeal to intellect and emo- 
tion within the country. They must both think and speak 
in the language, not translate, hesitate, and talk like a book 
—or worse. Such proficiency is to be attained only by liv- 
ing in the land where the language is native. 
Quite clearly this is but a minute field of specialized voca- 
tional training. In proportion as a field calls for but few 
workers, especially if the training must be intensive and 
thorough, vocational guidance should see that but few are 
trained. It is possible to urge that since one in each thou- 
sand high-school students will go into positions requiring 
Spanish, and since we do not usually know which is to be 
that one, we should therefore permit or encourage all to 
take the Spanish. To train the hundreds who do not need 
it merely to meet the needs of the one that does is a highly 
uneconomical method of meeting the needs of the one. And 
it loses sight of the needs of the hundreds. After public 
education has provided adequate vocational training for the 
millions who do not go into this narrowly specialized voca- 
tional field, then it will be time to undertake the specialized 
training of the few hundreds who do. 
Language needed for civic activities 
What are the defects in civic performance in our country 
that are demonstrably due to a lack of knowledge of foreign 
languages on the part of the citizens? Social leaders, polit-
-P-A-G-E-271
TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 263 
ical parties, and newspapers are busy, each from its own 
point of view, in pointing out numerous social deficiencies 
and their causes. They do not, however, point to ignorance 
of foreign languages as one of the important sources of gen- 
erally admitted civic inefficiency. When so many thousands 
of eyes are scanning the field, and when they are so often 
rendered acute by self-interest, it is not probable that any 
really fundamental cause of civic shortcoming can escape 
all eyes. 
In other chapters we have referred to readings necessary 
for developing national and municipal large-group conscious- 
ness. It is certain that the mother-tongue is most effective 
for giving understanding; for arousing emotional responses; 
and for developing sympathetic attitudes of mind. But 
when we look to the international situation, the problem is 
different. Man needs also to read for world-democratic sym- 
pathies and understandings. Is the English the only lan- 
guage that we need for the purpose? 
There are two conceivable ways of entering into world- 
experience. The foreign language advocates present one of 
these. We do not, they say, rightly enter into the experi- 
ences of other peoples unless we think their experience in 
the same language-terms in which they think that expe- 
rience. Rarely or never do they carry out their argu- 
ment to its logical conclusion. It contains the implication 
that we should learn the languages of the nations through- 
out the earth. Naturally the deprovincialization would be 
most effectively brought about through learning those of 
the largest nations in case only a portion could be covered. 
The most important languages, therefore, for the purpose 
would be Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese, Hindu- 
stani, German, and French. These with English would per- 
haps sufficiently cover the earth. It must be observed that 
the thing wanted is a planetary consciousness, not a mere 
   
-P-A-G-E-272
  264 THE CURRICULUM 
French one from learning French, or German one from 
learning German, or Roman one from learning Latin. If 
foreign languages are the necessary means for this purpose, 
clearly the ends cannot be reached through the study of 
just one foreign language, or even two. 
The alternative method is reading the history of nations 
in the English tongue and the literature of nations in good 
English translations. As a matter of fact, human experience 
in its fundamentals is much the same the world over, differ- 
ing only in details and proportions. It can be expressed 
about equally well by any of the world’s developed lan- 
guages. The basic thing is not the language but the experi- 
ence in the mind of the writer upon the one hand, and the 
reconstructed experience in the mind of the reader upon 
the other. It matters little what system of symbols is em- 
ployed in the transmission of this experience from the one 
to the other; or whether it starts in one language and through 
translation arrives in another. The only thing that counts 
is adequacy of reconstruction of the experience. Emerson 
once said: “I should as soon think of swimming across the 
Charles River when I wish to go to Boston as of reading all 
my books in the original when I have them rendered for me 
in my mother-tongue.” 
Foreign languages needed for family life 
It is obvious that under normal conditions the mother- 
tongue is all that is needed for family life. 
We have a serious problem, however, in the case of immi- 
grant populations, the adults of which bring a foreign tongue 
to our country, while the children grow up within an Eng- 
lish language atmosphere. The immigrants, in most in- 
stances, are laborers. They often use a corrupt variety of 
their native tongue. They are not greatly familiar with the 
literature of their own land. Their social status often causes
-P-A-G-E-273
  4 
TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 265 
them to be looked down upon by the native population; and 
their language also. Children growing up within an Ameri- 
can atmosphere unconsciously adopt the American attitude 
toward their ignorant parents. They lose respect for their 
parents and for the parental tongue. They drift prematurely 
away from the parental influences. This family disintegra- 
tion is often highly disastrous to the children; and destruc- 
tive of cherished parental hopes. 
The disintegration is due to many factors. But language 
being our major social bond, one of them certainly is the 
lack of a common language. Children decline to use a 
despised language; and the parents are not sufliciently 
plastic to take on that of their children. A partial allevia- 
tion could be produced by bringing the children to respect 
the parental tongue. This could best be accomplished by 
having the children read the stimulating literature of that 
tongue. While the basic language of all American schools 
should be English, in an Italian community the children 
might well be brought also to read the interesting literature 
of Italy; in a Polish community, that of Poland; in a Hun- 
garian community, the literature of Hungary. The children 
will come to respect the language which the school respects 
and which the literature reveals to them as a high and hon- 
orable tongue. 
If education here will look accurately to the social results 
to be aimed at and include nothing not demanded by such 
results, the task ought not to be a difficult one, nor to con- 
sume any large amount of time. A reading knowledge is 
all that the school need concern itself with. The children 
will get their speaking practice in their homes. The latter 
may not be grammatically accurate. But training must 
always be related to purposes. In this case the children are 
to be brought to respect the language of their parents. If, 
therefore, the parents speak a rather ignorant type of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  266 THE CURRICULUM 
language, the less the attention of the children is called to 
this, the better for all concerned. This will eliminate the 
necessity of teaching the grammar, composition, and the 
other things that require time. 
The schools will only take care of the reading. They 
need an abundance of the most fascinating stories obtain- 
able in the language; and so well graded that the gradient 
is imperceptible. As children master the mechanics of read- 
ing English, it will be easy to master the mechanics of read- 
ing their parental tongue. There need not be much class- 
work — only enough to introduce the social motives and 
stimulations. Their textbooks and supplementary reading 
books in history, geography, literature, etc., might occasion- 
ally be in part in their parental language. 
All of the other purposes of the training of these children 
are to be kept in mind at the same time so that this one 
shall not be exaggerated and receive an undue proportion 
of time or energy. Harmonious family life is but one end 
of many for which these children are to be trained. The 
reason disappears in the second generation. Educational 
inertia can then be no justification for retention of the lan- 
guage. 
Foreign languages and leisure occupations 
All admit that the reading of good literature is a healthy 
and desirable leisure occupation. This literature exists in 
a few ancient and in several modern languages. It is gen- 
erally accepted that except for those forms of poetry where 
the effects are so largely dependent upon rhythm and other 
sensuous elements, a translation properly done is practi- 
cally as good as the original. It may be better. But among 
the essences of leisure occupations are variety, novelty, 
and freshness of experience. Stale experiences do not 
satisfy. In music, for example, one likes to hear selections
-P-A-G-E-275
TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 267 
produced through different media: orchestra, band, piano, 
organ, voice, chorus, opera, etc. This employment of dif- 
ferent media greatly widens and diversifies the musical ex- 
periences and increases the sum total of enjoyment. In 
literature likewise, one enjoys different media. Literature 
in the foreign tongue often brings a tingling of new and 
eager interests that is less evident when the same litera- 
ture is received through the routine grooves of vernacular 
habit. 
This appears to be a higher or less sensuous form of 
spiritual recreation than music. It cannot then represent 
a less justifiable type of leisure occupation. It is not im- 
probable that for some, who can really use it as a satisfying 
leisure occupation, it is even more justifiable and more 
fruitful. The chief question that arises is, Is it not too high 
and rarefied a type of recreation for people in general? 
Clearly it can be justifiable only in the case of those in 
whom it will actually function as a leisure occupation. 
This end cannot in any degree justify forcing the language 
upon the unwilling. The literature probably can have 
humanizing effectiveness, can expand and enrich the per- 
sonality, only when it is read with fully aroused emotional 
reverberations. If it is read as a prescribed task, laboriously 
and without zest, little of value can come of it. It is not 
good as a training experience; it will not lead to the desired 
recreational habits. 
A thing that is to function as a leisure occupation must be 
got as a leisure occupation. When this is the dominant pur- 
pose of learning a foreign language it seems certain that 
the learning should be of the play or interest-driven type. 
The teacher’s business will be to provide favorable condi- 
tions, to lead, to stimulate, to encourage, to supply the 
contagions of enthusiasm. On the side of actual teaching, 
the teacher must give the pupils a start in vocabulary, pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
Be ee gee ee tO ESET EE WB Re Pee ge Er pec 
268 THE CURRICULUM 
nunciation, fundamental grammatical forms, etc.; but the 
novelty of beginning a new language, if the teacher is com- 
petent in finding the springs of pupil-interest, fills this ini- 
tial learning with the play-spirit. The start having been 
made, then the less teaching the better — just as upon the 
play-field, the less play-supervision the better. Since the 
end is reading and not speech or writing, the pupils’ ex- 
perience will be mainly reading — at the dictates of inter- 
est. The teacher will see that the necessary abundance of 
attractive readings are at hand, and so well graded that 
pupils can mainly be emancipated from grammars and dic- 
tionaries, and learn to read by reading. 
When the training is mainly through an abundance of 
easy and interesting reading, the pedagogy relates mainly 
to leadership and control of motives. There is no longer 
justification for that perverse practice on the part of lan- 
guage teachers of pouncing upon the hard spots, the un- 
familiar words, the difficult and irregular grammatical 
forms and relationships; and thus demanding explanations 
of just the things which the pupil has not got; ought not 
to have got at his stage of learning; and ought not to be 
required to explain. 
We find here another example of the fallacy that a thing 
must be fully known in order to be known at all. As a 
matter of fact, little children listen to the speech of their 
parents and understand the general drift of thought with- 
out fully understanding the meaning of every word; and 
without being able to explain any of the grammar. As they 
grow older and have fuller experience both with things 
and language, the difficulties disappear without thought or 
effort. In the same way, one can read the easy literature 
of a foreign language, and move in the full current of 
the story without knowing the meaning of all words met 
with, and with little knowledge of the grammar. Let this  
-P-A-G-E-277
TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 269 
experience continue, week after week, month after month, 
and year after year, and the meaning of the unfamiliar 
words will gradually unfold without effort. 
The present technique of education is largely an elabo- 
rate technique of prematurity. It is attempt to teach pre- 
maturely what later would develop naturally through the 
normal processes of living. 
This reading plan of recreational training does not re- 
quire society to invest so much money and time in the 
teaching of foreign languages as at present. Only those 
who like the languages will take them. When a pupil’s in 
terest so slackens that he will not under normal stimula- 
tion continue his reading, clearly he should drop the study. 
This will leave only those who are moving under their own 
power. A great amount of teacher-effort will not then be 
required. Classes may be large and need not meet fre- 
quently; or if small may have pupil-leaders. And there is 
the saving of most of the energy now given to grammar 
and composition and vexation of spirit. 
Let these conditions be brought about, and it is the pre- 
diction of the writer that there will be a considerable pro- 
portion of our population who will take advantage of this 
recreational opportunity, and effectively go through with 
it; and who will reap the good harvest that must come 
from such non-sensuous type of recreational experience. 
The arguments for this type of leisure occupation are 
not strong until we become a reading people, and read our 
own rich English literature. This is the largest of the world’s 
literatures. It is the most diversified of all, owing to the 
Anglo-Saxon dispersion. It is the most cosmopolitan. It 
alone will de-provincialize one. It contains most of the 
best of all literatures ancient and modern in good transla< 
tion. Within itself, it employs many media of expression 
It is a thing of infinite moods. Compare the military-band

style of Kipling with the symphony orchestra style of 
Shakespeare, the “big bow-wow style” of Scott, as he 
himself termed it, with the “fine cameo style” of Jane Aus- 
ten. Let one note the acid of Dean Swift, the geniality of 
Chaucer or Charles Lamb, the thunders of Carlyle, the 
varied music of Tennyson and Byron and Milton, the virile 
grace of Stevenson and Joseph Conrad, and the varying 
moods of Uncle Remus and Mark Twain and O. Henry. 
Let one note the diversified wealth of lyric, epic, idyl, 
drama, novel, essay, humor, oration, and religious or phil- 
osophical meditation. Let one then look into the diversi- 
fied media and moods provided in translations: the English 
Bible, Homer, Virgil, Plato, Cervantes, Dante, Dumas, 
Balzac, Tolstoy, Omar Khayy4m, Bjornsen, Ibsen, Freitag, 
Maeterlinck, and Tagore. 
There are moods and media enough in the literature of 
the English tongue to satisfy the present recreational lit- 
erary cravings of most of our population — most even of 
those who go through the high schools. In large measure 
it is now unutilized opportunity. We believe that men and 
women should be trained for foreign-language recreational 
reading if they will actually take sufficient advantage of 
their opportunities; but it is absurd beyond expression to 
train them for any such opportunities when they do not 
even take advantage of the infinitely rich and diversified 
literature of their own tongue. Beyond the conventional 
two or three books of each, few people, even those who have 
gone through high school and college, have read Scott, 
Stevenson, or Conrad; or in translation, Bjérnsen, Tol- 
stoy, Balzac, or Ibsen. Much less do those same high-school 
and college individuals who have had to take foreign lan- 
guages for some undefined purpose, use them for recrea- 
tional reading. 
Suppose a foreign language is to be offered in high schools
-P-A-G-E-279
  TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 271 
for leisure reading, which is to be chosen? Quite evi- 
dently it is the one which contains the largest and best lit- 
erature. In order to ascertain this the writer took the more 
than seven hundred volumes of “Everyman’s Library” 
which aims to bring together the best of all of the world’s 
literatures in English translation. Since it is a commercial 
enterprise, producing books at low price which will appeal 
to the reading tastes of the population in general, its se- 
lections ought to reveal the literatures which have the 
largest number of books of general appeal. Omitting those 
of English-speaking peoples, the number of volumes from 
each of the world’s most important literatures are shown 
in the accompanying table: —

Other book-lists afford confirmation of these figures. 
Among modern literatures, there can be no doubt that the 
literature of France stands head and shoulders over every 
other literature except the English. If only one language 
is to be studied for the purpose here discussed, it should 
doubtless be French. 
If one wants a second language for this purpose it looks 
as though it might as well be Greek, Russian, Scandinavian, 
German or Italian. It is unfortunate that this purpose does 
not point more clearly to Spanish. This justification is 
really needed to support other valid reasons for studying 
Spanish, which in themselves, without this one, are scarcely 
sufficient, except in special instances.
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 THE CURRICULUM 
Foreign languages needed for proficiency in English 
Few urge modern languages as aids to training in Eng: 
lish. There is, however, a common presumption among 
teachers that the large place accorded Latin is justified 
on this basis. But the scientific curriculum-discoverer 
cannot proceed upon ill-defined presumptions. He must 
know with definiteness and particularity just what the 
serious deficiencies in our use of English are that are de- 
monstrably due to inability to read, translate, and explain 
the grammar of Latin; and which have no other sufficient 
remedy. 
Let us locate these if they exist, by a method of elimina- 
tion. In the first place in the English training the most 
fundamental things to be developed are: genuine desire to 
use good English, right valuations or appreciations of good 
English, and habits of watchfulness against errors of all 
kinds. These attitudes obviously result mainly from social 
stimulations and contagions. They are developed mainly 
by living within a language atmosphere in which good Eng- 
lish is spoken and read and valued. Language valuations 
are almost wholly social matters, obtained from one’s asso- 
ciates chiefly through unconscious imitation. Latin has 
little or nothing to do with the matter. 
English training further aims at the development of the 
habits, skills, and technical knowledge involved in pro- 
nunciation, choice of words, construction of sentences, use 
of English ‘inflections and concord, construction of the 
larger forms of discourse, oral and written presentation of 
thought, reading, spelling, and handwriting. If one has 
right valuations, and can do all of these things well, he 
will have a pretty secure control over his English. In each 
of the things, deficiencies are common. But examine them 
one by one, and in most cases there is not even a remote
-P-A-G-E-281
TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 278 
probability that the deficiencies are due to inability to read 
and explain Latin. 
Latin has a slight value for spelling; though on the whole 
it is the Saxon words that give most trouble; and if one 
cannot remember the English spelling, how can he with 
greater assurance remember the Latin? 
It is urged for sentence-construction and concord, 
through aiding in one’s knowledge of English grammar. 
Doubtless it will help; but it is a tremendously expensive 
way to get the little grammar really needed for correcting 
some twenty-five kinds of English errors. Those whose 
English is so seriously defective that they need Latin for 
the purpose generally do not get it; and those who get it 
generally grow up in such a cultivated language-atmos- 
phere that they do not greatly need it for the purpose men- 
tioned. 
The argument simmers down to vocabulary-develop- 
ment. One needs Latin, French, and Anglo-Saxon for 
the etymology of the five thousand words that one uses; 
and for the fifteen thousand that one reads. The presump- 
tions are two: (1) the etymology gives understanding of 
meanings; (2) one should learn the languages from which 
English comes to understand the etymology. There is 
some truth in both; and more error. 
One must note the psychology of vocabulary-building. 
The simplest and usual condition of vocabulary-learning 
is where one meets with some new thing, action, quality, 
or relation; and at the same time gets the word that ex- 
presses it. In the presence of any new aspect of reality one 
is not easy in mind till one has the necessary word in terms 
of which to think it. The presence of the reality calls for 
the word. When brought together they associate so closely 
as to fuse into a single conception. The basic condition of 
vocabulary-building is contact with the realities. If one is
-P-A-G-E-282
274 THE CURRICULUM 
to have a wide and varied vocabulary then the first condi- 
tion is that he come into vital contact with numerous 
and varied aspects of reality; verbalizing his experience. 
If, for example, one would require the vocabulary of the 
motor-car — limousine, chassis, carburetor, commutator, 
differential, magneto, muffler, transmission, etc. —let him 
operate the car, repair it, make adjustments, consult hand- 
books for the necessary information, talk over matters with 
others, etc.; and the full vocabulary will grow up so easily 
and naturally that one does not notice how or when he 
acquired it. Make experience central and the vocabulary will 
take care of itself. If one would acquire the vocabulary of a 
farm, a steel-mill, a hospital, the game of golf, a science, 
a religion, or anything else, material or immaterial, the 
principle holds. Let one study Latin till he is gray, he 
will find that for vocabulary-building it is a poor and pale 
substitute for reality. 
The older plan was to use simple well-known English 
words for explaining the meaning of the Latin vocabulary; 
and then to use that Latin vocabulary to explain the mean- 
ing of other English words. It was a matter of pouring 
meanings from English into Latin, and then back again. 
It was to use a small body of meanings got from a little 
contact with reality to produce a large body of substantial 
meanings without any further contacts with realities. It 
reminds one of the street-fakir who from an ounce of soap 
produces three barrels of foam. There is increased iri- 
descence; and one is impressed; but no increase of sub- 
stance. The schools of the past were places of words not 
realities. It is not therefore surprising that this primitive 
faith in verbal methods should linger. 
And yet etymology has legitimate functions to perform. 
Let us illustrate some of them. We have in English some 
twenty or thirty commonly-used prefixes borrowed from
-P-A-G-E-283
ee Go, ee ee ea ee oe MM Ce TES ne ag Wg, cose tale TP en ne 
TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES Q75 
the Latin, such as bi-, circum-, contra-, semi-, post-, trans-, 
uni-, etc. We have another twenty or thirty more or less 
common prefixes imported from the Greek: anti-, mon-, 
mono-, pan-, penta-, poly-, tri-, hemi-, iso-, etc. We have 
also some sixty or eighty suffixes variously derived from 
Latin, Greek, Old French, and Anglo-Saxon: -fy, -ed, -hood, 
-tion, -cion, -tse, ~ize, -less, ~ish, -ie, -kin, -ling, -ness, -able, 
-ly, ete. 
Now, it does not really matter from what languages these 
have been imported. They are essential portions of the 
English tongue. They have become completely natural- 
ized and they are as much a portion of the living English 
as its Saxon element. It is no more necessary to study the 
Latin in order to get the significance of a hundred and 
fifty English affixes than it is to study the ancient Aryan, 
which preceded the Latin in order to understand the terms 
which the Latin borrowed from it. 
Given favorable conditions their mastery involves prac- 
tically no problem. Bring the children into contact with 
the actual realities in relation to which the prefixes and 
suffixes have significance, call attention to this significance, 
in so far as pupils need to be made conscious of it, and the 
work is done without effort. For example, in the mathe- 
matics let the children know that bi- means two, as they 
come into contact with bi-nominals, bi-sections, etc.; that 
tri- means three, as they come into contact with triangles, 
tri-sections, tri-nominals, etc. Let children meet with semi- 
weekly, semi-annual, semi-circle, etc., as verbalized reali- 
ties, and it does not require a great deal of effort on the 
part of teachers to make them conscious of the signifi- 
cance of semi-. Let them come into contact with both 
realities and diminutives like doggie, lambkin, duckling, 
hillock, eaglet, ete., and the understanding is acquired 
without thought or effort. This is but to apply the cen-

276 THE CURRICULUM 
tral principle of reality-teaching rather than verbal-teach- 
ing to the vocabulary-building. 
The roots or stems of many English words have also 
| been imported and naturalized; as, for example, dico or 
| dicto in diction, dictionary, dictate, dictum, abdicate, contra- 
dict, predict, edict, interdict, verdict, dictator, etc. Of these 
_root-terms there are several score in common use that prob- 
ably should be generally known; and even a few hundred 
that may be known with profit by those who would acquire 
a finished knowledge and appreciation of English. Most of 
the root-terms have been naturalized and are now as much 
parts of the English as they ever were of the Anglo-Saxon, 
Latin, or Greek. They are the common possessions of any 
language that cares to adopt them. The meanings are 
mainly read into the root-terms by associating them with 
the realities to which they refer. These terms can be broken 
out of their English matrix, the generalized meaning re- 
vealed, and then used in the study of families of English 
derivatives that employ the root-terms. One can thus study 
the etymology of English without studying Latin, French, 
or Anglo-Saxon. Most of us who have not studied Greek 
appreciate the etymology of such words as psychology, 
theology, pantheon, biography, biology, bibliography, phi- 
losophy, phonograph, etc., about as completely as we appre- 
ciate the words from the Latin which we have studied. 
And we can use the roots borrowed from the Greek just as 
efficiently in analyzing derivatives. 
In general, it is not through etymological associations 
that one acquires the meanings of words. Take, for ex- 
ample, the derivatives serve, serf, servant, servitor, service, 
servitude, serviceable, servile, subservient, etc. All come from 
a single root. A dictionary knowledge of the meaning of 
this root will not give one any inkling of the finer nuances 
of meanings. The root-term, for example, does not reveal  
-P-A-G-E-285
  TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES QT 
the subtle differences of meaning in servant, serf, and ser- 
vitor; or between service and servitude. One gets these deli- 
cate but vital differences through contacts with the reali- 
ties themselves, either immediate or imaginative. One who 
reads and observes widely and accurately but who has 
never noted the etymology of these words will acquire the 
finer shades of meaning as completely as one who is familiar 
with the etymology. And if he can get the subtler flavors 
of words in this way, surely he can thus also get the crass 
meanings of the root-terms. 
A further question relates to the technical terminology 
of specialists: biologists, physiologists, physicians, etc. 
The basic thing needed for making them specialists is full, 
varied and intimate contacts with the realities of their 
specialized fields. At bottom they need to know things, not 
words. But adequate knowledge of things involves the 
use of words — the improved vehicles of human thought. 
But the reality-method of getting at the things makes the 
language aspect easy. The presence of the thing calls for 
the language necessary for thinking it. Let the young phy- 
sician once learn, for example, that hema means blood; and 
then let his daily experiences involve such terms as hema- 
chrome, hemabarometer, hemacytometer, hemaphobus, hema- 
tozoa, hemorrhage, hemoglobin, hemoperitoneum, hemophobia, 
hemoscope, hemotropic, etc., — he will very easily learn the 
value and significance of hema- as a root word for his tech- 
nical field. Let him read Greek literature for twenty 
years, and he can never thereby acquire any better under- 
standing of this word. And he can learn his other techni- 
cal terms in the same way. Rare terms he will have to look 
up in a dictionary — like ordinary people. There is always 
a fringe of little-used words that require the use of the dic- 
tionary. 
It must be kept in mind that we are here discussing but
-P-A-G-E-286
  278 THE CURRICULUM 
a single phase of the problem. To assert that a mastery 
of Latin grammar and literature is not necessary for a thor- 
ough understanding and appreciation of English is not 
equivalent to saying that Latin should not be studied for 
this purpose by those who are willing to employ this 
method. Many of those who appreciate linguistic study 
as recreational experience will be justified in taking Latin 
for immediate and subsequent recreational uses. As it 
then gives them a goodly portion of their etymological 
background, it will have accomplished a double purpose. 
It cannot serve as a substitute for the reality-method; but 
it can substantially reinforce it. Latin will then be taken 
only by those of linguistic appreciation, with the students 
mainly moving under their own power. The Latinists 
should then supply them with the wealth of interesting 
readings needed for the imperceptible gradient of experi- 
ence that will permit them to learn to read the language by 
reading it. Under such circumstances those who want the 
Latin can get all that they want without requiring too 
much effort and expense on the part of teachers and school 
systems. Under present teaching conditions, the cost, 
especially in time and loss of other more important things, 
is usually disproportionate to the returns. 
Foreign languages needed for humanistic experience 
It is generally supposed that there is an intimate, even 
indissoluble, relation between the classical languages and 
humanism. Before one can rightly note the relation, how- 
ever, one must first define humanistic experiences in terms 
of twentieth-century life; and in their particularized forms. 
This we have tried to do in some measure in previous chap- 
ters. To look with wide and sympathetic vision over all 
human affairs, near and remote, recent and ancient; to 
enter freely and sympathetically into all worthy kinds of
-P-A-G-E-287
  TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 279 
human experience, directly through participation and ob- 
servation, and indirectly through conversation and lecture 
and wide reading; to range with quickened mind through 
the rich and inspiring fields of science and art and phi- 
losophy and religion; to feel a oneness with one’s race, and 
to be fired with its highest aspirations; to act with one’s 
fellows vigorously, joyously and whole-heartedly in the 
codperative provision of a full and rich life-opportunity 
for every human being, — such as these are humanistic 
experiences. Those experiences in which man realizes his 
full humanity constitute the substance of humanism. 
This is not to give a new definition to humanism. It is 
but to rescue its original one; and to state it in terms of 
twentieth-century thought and life. It is to see that hu- 
manism is not a thing of language alone; but rather of the 
full texture of life. Any language in which one can live and 
think can be the language of humanism. 
In the day of the Renaissance, the classics provided 
the languages and much of the thought of the wider hu- 
manistic experience. But vernacular literatures have since 
arisen which can not only provide the same experiences, but 
the far wider ones of modern life; and which also can 
serve the humanistic needs of all, a democratic require- 
ment, and not merely those of a small leisure class. 
The classicists of to-day are much concerned because of 
an alleged attack upon humanism. As a matter of fact, 
there is little discernible attack upon actual humanism. 
The attack is only upon the conception that only the an- 
cient languages can serve in a democratic age as the ve- 
hicles of humanistic experience. One has but to look about 
him to see that, in spite of the apparent contradictions of 
war, the world grows more humanistic in its conceptions, 
aspirations and practices. More and more we would bring 
to all social classes the varied and essential humanistic 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
280 THE CURRICULUM 
experiences that have hitherto fallen only to the lot of the 
intellectual and social aristocratic few. To all we would 
give fullness of vital contacts with men, with nature, with 
literature and history and art and high religion. To all so 
far as possible we would give the far vision outward and 
backward and upward. There are aristocrats and Philis- 
tines who are indifferent to this wide diffusion of human- 
istic experience, or who are skeptical of its possibility. But 
in general they are making no active attack upon it. 
It is under the circumstances unfortunate that classicists 
should have the erroneous idea that humanistic experiences 
require the ancient vehicles of thought; that the world is a 
decadent affair in which modern languages are so wretchedly 
weak and shabby as not to be able to carry the ancient 
experiences; and even that modern human experience is 
inferior to that of the peoples of old. There is attack and 
justifiable attack upon such pessimism and puerility. The 
attack however is not because of hostility to humanistic 
experience. It is brought by the optimistic, forward-looking 
friends of twentieth-century humanism. To them humane- 
ness and richness and nobility of spirit seem so good for the 
world that they would have these things for all men and 
women; and therefore they would employ for the purpose 
the language of our democracy rather than the ancient out- 
worn languages of the intellectual aristocracy. 
The classicists have not defined humanism in terms of the 
essential realities. They have defined it only in terms of the 
symbols of thought: of the verbal associates of the older 
humanistic experience of centuries ago. 
As a matter of fact, reading the ancient literatures in the 
originals is not an essential factor in developing humane- 
ness, or gentleness, or richness and elevation and nobility 
of thought and feeling, or high appreciation of esthetic art, 
or of any of the other essentials of high character. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  TRAINING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 281 
cynical disbelief on the part of the classicists of the possibil- 
ity or desirability of democratic diffusion of humanistic 
experience to all makes them unsafe defenders of actual 
humanism in our democratic age. Their major effort is not 
to find means of the greatest possible amount of such diffu- 
sion; but rather to retain an impossible vehicle of diffusion. 
It is the social-minded men and women of to-day who 
are the real leaders of modern humanism. A few are lin- 
guists; most are not. Some are in the educational profes- 
sion; most are in other fields of labor. But it is those whose 
primary interest is in their fellow-men rather than in Jan- 
guages, and whose fundamental faith is in mankind rather 
than in symbols, who are to-day leading and guiding hu- 
manity toward fullness of self-realization.

  CHAPTER XXI 
SOME CONCLUDING CONSIDERATIONS 
In this volume we have tried to look at the curriculum 
problems from the point of view of social needs; and there- 
by to develop, in some measure at least, the social point 
of view as regards education. In a single volume, one can 
present but glimpses of a limited number of the detailed 
tasks. Others of similar type stretch out apparently end- 
lessly before us. Our profession is confronted with the huge 
practical task of defining innumerable specific objectives; 
and then of determining the countless pupil-experiences 
that must be induced by way of bringing the children to 
attain the objectives. We have lacked space for discussion 
here of the administrative problems. But let us refer briefly 
to a few of them. 
The first necessary thing is for our whole educational 
profession to acquire a social, rather than a merely academic, 
point of view. The writer fully appreciates the difficulties 
in the way, as may be illustrated by a personal reference. 
Soon after the American occupation of the Philippine Islands, 
the writer was a member of a committee of seven appointed 
to draw up an elementary-school curriculum for the islands. 
The members had all taught or supervised within the islands 
for two or three years and were reasonably familiar with 
their peculiar conditions. It was a virgin field in which we 
were free to recommend almost anything by way of meeting 
the needs of the population. We had an opportunity to do 
a magnificent and original constructive piece of work. 
And what did we do? We assembled upon a table in the 
committee-room copies of the American textbooks in read-
-P-A-G-E-291
SOME CONCLUDING CONSIDERATIONS 283 
ing, arithmetic, geography, United States history, and the 
other subjects with which we had been familiar in American 
schools. We also assembled such American courses of study 
as we could find; and without being conscious of it, we mo- 
bilized our American prejudices and preconceptions as to 
what an elementary-school course ought to be. On the basis 
of these things we made out a course of study for the tra- 
ditional eight elementary-school grades. We provided the 
traditional amount of each subject for each grade, distrib- 
uted them as in American schools, and recommended Ameri- 
can textbooks for the work. 
The thing was not adapted to the conditions within the 
islands. As a matter of fact, we did not try to adapt it to 
those conditions— though we honestly thought that we were 
doing the thing needed. The difficulty was that our minds 
ran so completely in the grooves of traditional thought 
that we did not realize the possibility of anything else. We 
greatly needed something to shatter our self-complacency 
and bring us to see education in terms of the society that 
was to be educated. We needed principles of curriculum- 
making. We did not know that we should first determine 
objectives from a study of social needs. We supposed that 
education consisted only of teaching the familiar subjects. 
We had not come to see that it is essentially a process of 
unfolding the potential abilities of a population, and in 
particularized relatio.. to the social conditions. We had 
not learned that studies are means, not ends. We did not 
realize that any instrument or experience which is effective 
in such unfoldment is the right instrument and right experi- 
ence; and that anything which is not effective is wrong, 
however time-honored and widely used it may be. Fortu- 
nately for the people, the Director of Education was better 
able to look at essential realities; he cut the course down to 
six grades, unceremoniously threw out irrelevant materials, 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
    284 THE CURRICULUM 
and without regard for the time-hallowed sanctities brought 
bodily into the course a number of things the: ore than 
now regarded as superficial and plebeian, such as shop- 
work, cooking, sewing, weaving, rug-making, ete. We were 
properly horrified. 
“We neédedsomething that would shake us out of the 
grooves and which at the same time was violent enough to 
obliterate them, and set thought free. Attention is called 
to this personal experience because of a belief that it is an 
example of a wide-spread obstructive influence in American 
education to-day. A large portion of our profession appears 
to need something that will lift them out of the grooves 
of routine traditional thinking — or rather out of an imita- 
tion that is not thought— and which will so obliterate the 
grooves that their minds will be free to think out new prob- 
lems. For in the field of the curriculum, the whole world 
to-day is presented with a magnificent opportunity for origi- 
nal constructive work. The present social débdcle demon- 
strates the inadequacy of types of education upon which we 
have relied in the past. 
Some of the things necessary for the liberation of thought 
have been attempted in these chapters. They are written 
. with the assumption that we must establish fundamental 
principles and employ scientific methods in formulating 
systems of training. All of the advance in the curriculum 
field at present — and there is much in all progressive school 
systems — is pioneer, experimental, suggestive. In these 
chapters we have tried to formulate some of the curriculum- 
thought that is in a state of ferment throughout the field. 
There is nothing recommended here but what is actually 
being done somewhere and in some measure by practical and 
progressive school men and women. 
At the present stage of developing courses of training it 
is more important that our profession agree upon a method
-P-A-G-E-293
  
SOME CONCLUDING CONSIDERATIONS 285 
of curriculum-discovery than that we agree upon the de- 
tails of curriculum-content. The writer has been chiefly 
interested in this volume in suggesting a method, and fun- 
damental points of view. The reader may or may not agree 
with the conclusions. That is of little consequence. The 
main thing at present is that each find scientific principles 
and methods of curriculum-formulation which he can him- 
self accept; and which will make thought the basis of cur- 
riculum-making rather than imitation. Without such prin- 
ciples at the present moment, one is like a ship in the wide 
seas without chart, compass, or stars. 
Our professional vision must be greatly in advance of our 
practice. We shall move forward only step by step with feet 
on solid earth; but we must be able to see far beyond our 
immediate next steps in order that they be taken in the 
right direction. The work of our profession, more than that 
of any other, requires foresight and far sight. For this rea- 
son, in our discussion of ends and means, we have not looked 
merely to what is practicable next year, or even five years 
hence. Often we have discussed matters that are to be de- 
veloped only through a slow-moving program covering a 
long series of years. 
A superintendent who recently listened to the suggestions 
made in this volume presented this question: “What should 
a superintendent actually do by way of improving the cur- 
riculum in his schools?” 
To begin with, he should accept the situation in his city 
as it is. He should look upon it as the normal, and therefore 
proper, result of the institutional growth-influences that 
have been operative in that city. He should therefore ac- 
cept the conditions as right and good in the sense that they 
represent a growth-stage, conditions being what they are, 
through which the city must pass before it can arrive at its 
next normal stage of healthy growth. He should expect the
-P-A-G-E-294
ee ee ee ne oes 
286 THE CURRICULUM 
curriculum to change and grow from year to year, rapidly . 
or slowly. Naturally he would like to have rapid growth; but 
he would have to accept conditions as they are. The only 
normal thing is for the growth to continue with a rapidity 
that is determined by the conditions within the city. This 
would mean in one city rapid growth; in another, slow — 
at least until this could be normally accelerated. 
Even if given a free hand, he should attempt no abrupt 
reorganization of the work, nor any sudden reformulation 
of the studies. In other words, he should not attempt to 
accelerate the growth beyond that which can be normal and 
healthy; and permanent after it is once accomplished. The 
details of the work have to be carried out by teachers who 
have been trained both in their academic courses and in 
their professional experience to certain types of work. He 
could expect teachers to assimilate only those suggestions 
for improvement which do not mean radical departure from 
what they have been accustomed to. But after having taken 
these first steps, he could expect them then to be prepared 
to go a little farther; and then later, to take other steps in 
advance. The readjustments in the teacher’s thought and 
practice must be gradual. This is true also of school board 
and community. They are not prepared for any type of re- 
organization that greatly differs from that with which they 
are familiar. Like the teachers they can shift only gradually. 
All must be a growth-process. And what is more, the super- 
intendent would find that his own ideas were insufficiently 
worked out in detail for directing reformulative procedure 
which broke in any sudden manner from the old. He would 
have to think out innumerable details and try them out in 
practice. While this was being done, he would want the 
best that has been accumulated in the years past to continue 
until he was reasonably certain as to the exact details of the 
next steps that are to be taken. If he is to make mistakes, it 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  SOME CONCLUDING CONSIDERATIONS 287 
is better for him to continue the old mistakes than to in- 
vent a new series. 
The superintendent will remember that inertia is as much 
a factor in the general human economy as dynamic forces; 
that the conservation of gains is as important as making 
further gains. He will be content with neither without the 
other. 
Along with principals and teachers on the one hand and 
school board and community upon the other — for he should 
insist not only upon democracy of opportunity, but also of 
responsibility — he should look over the work in every sub- 
ject within the system, elementary school and high school, in 
the attempt d_those places where further growth is 
demanded _ by community needs; especially those where 
teachers, school board, and community are prepared to take 
the natural next steps of progress; and where they are in a 
mood to accept leadership in that direction. 
For example, he will find manual activities going on as a 
portion of the course. He will try to find the dozen or so 
relatively small ways in which the work can be improved; 
and he will try to get those relatively small things done. In 
locating them, he will consider the educational principles 
relative to making work real, making it pleasurable, intellec- 
tualizing it through mathematics, science, and design; social- 
izing the activities by introducing the history, geography, 
and economics of the field; the introduction of observational 
activities, practical participation, reading for vision and so- 
cial appreciations. Making no changes except where there is 
a clear guiding principle, moving by short steps, trying out 
everything before going far, it is possible to make progress 
that is relatively sure in direction and relatively certain to 
be permanent. This small amount of progress accomplished, 
the stage is set for taking another short step. This step can 
lead to a third; and so the process may continue indefinitely. 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
288 THE CURRICULUM 
He will then turn to another subject, history, let us say. 
He will find many good results being secured. But he can 
find, on the basis of curriculum principles, a dozen ways or 
more in which it may in some measure be improved without 
confusing the thought or practice of teachers or community. 
He doubtless can take some reasonably long steps in advance 
provided he can secure the necessary reading materials. 
In the same way through making a multitude of little 
changes in each subject he can with assurance arrive by 
the stages of normal growth and with reasonable speed at 
a curriculum that is better adapted to social needs. By 
enlisting the active codperation of all concerned, all can 
move forward together. 
To keep from getting lost among the innumerable de- 
tails of many subjects, distributed over many grades, super- 
intendent and staff should codperatively draw up a con- 
cise summary of the curriculum principles to be kept in 
mind in connection with each subject. In some of the sub- 
jects there should probably be different lists for different 
grade levels. These should be printed so that they could be 
continually used in checking and rechecking the situation 
as regards each subject. They, too, should be subjected 
to continual revision. 
The superintendent will not try to advance more rapidly 
than teachers, school board, and community are prepared 
for. He will consider his position to be not educator for 
the community; but rather only a specialized leader of the 
community in its labors of educating its children. In other 
words, he will conceive the responsibility of education to be 
not his primarily, but rather one that rests squarely upon the 
total community. He is but a specialized helper and leader 
in the work. If he goes faster than they can or will go and 
leaves them behind, by so doing he abdicates the responsi- 
bility that they have delegated to him. As a leader he must 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  SOME CONCLUDING CONSIDERATIONS 289 
" take the community with him; or he is no longer its leader. 
If they are backward and slow, his pace must be determined 
by their pace; except as he can normally accelerate it. If 
they are awake and progressive and eager and able to pro- 
ceed rapidly, he must lead in progress of that character. 
It is not inconceivable that his task of seeing that work is 
substantial and permanent may sometimes require restraint 
upon an over-eager community. 
He will assume that not all progress is to be made in this 
generation; that something is to be left for those that come 
after us. And yet, he will attempt all of the progress for 
which conditions are ripe, and for which he can without 
forcing make them ripe.

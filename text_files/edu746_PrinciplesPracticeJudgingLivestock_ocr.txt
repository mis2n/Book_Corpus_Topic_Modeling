  PREFACE 
Wirs the extension of the live-stock industry and the 
development of the sciences fundamental thereto, the 
necessity is felt for striking at the root of things, of getting 
well under the surface. This necessity is emphasized par- 
ticularly in the matter of live-stock judging. The study 
of feeds and feeding, of the principles of breeding, and of 
systems of live-stock management have progressed further 
along scientific lines than has the study of live-stock 
judging. 
Doubtless there are many buyers and breeders of ani- 
mals whose judgment is more accurate, even, than that 
of the trained expert, but there is neither science nor 
system in their reasoning and they cannot tell why they so 
decide. In order that others may be trained in ways of 
live-stock improvement it is important that our knowledge 
of animal excellence be increased, our powers of observa- 
tion and perception made more keen, our judgment in 
making comparisons more logical, and our decisions more 
accurate. To do this requires a more exhaustive and 
scientific study of the subject. The best way to under- 
stand the exterior of animal form is to study the interior. 
Nowadays we make soil surveys where we formerly con- 
sidered only area and topography. It seems reasonable 
that the best judge of a steer’s loin should be a connoisseur 
of porterhouse; to prognosticate most closely the dur- 
ability of a horse’s foot one should know all of the com-

plicated structures contained within its horny wall and 
their related functions, as concerned in locomotion. It is 
not sufficient simply to require that the texture of a cow’s 
udder shall or shall not be thus and so, but reasons should 
be given in terms of more or less pounds of milk. 
The nomenclature needs revision and a more consistent 
use of specific terms might be adopted. Some names are 
misleading. It is related how a leading agricultural edu- 
eator had to see the “ milk” vein punctured before he 
would be convinced that blood and not milk flowed through 
it. Ifthe name “ mammary vein ” were employed instead 
of ‘‘ milk vein,’ no such erroneous meaning would be 
conveyed. Some regions which are specifically designated 
cannot be definitely described. No one can determine, for 
instance, just where the shoulder vein of the steer becomes 
neck on the one side and shoulder on the other. Some 
terms with a distinct significance are used loosely and 
interchangeably. It is the fore quarter of the steer but 
the fore hand of the horse; the rump of the cow, the croup 
of the horse. The appearance of the dairy cow is spare 
or lean, not thin. The draft horse is compact while the 
heavy harness horse is closely made, and to say that the 
latter is compact is to suggest draftiness, a feature which 
he should not possess. 
It would be as impracticable to drop the objectionable 
names in common usage as it is unscientific to retain them ; 
the intelligent husbandman should command them both in 
order to converse intelligently with either the stockmen 
whom he must cultivate and from whom he derives 
much of his inspiration and knowledge of the work, or 
those students whose instructor he may be. 
The effort has been made, in the preparation of this 
work, to take the student and stockman a step further

along this line than he has gone heretofore. Care has 
been exercised not to sacrifice the popular phase upon 
which our knowledge of the subject is based but to bridge 
over onto a more technical consideration of it. 
It is hoped that the author’s intention of keeping the 
work thoroughly practical, yet giving it a touch of a 
somewhat technical nature, will be appreciated by students 
and stockmen alike.

LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
CHAPTER I 
GENERAL VIEW 
  TuE ultimate object of live-stock husbandry is the pro- 
duction of market animals and their products, an end 
which is attained by two steps or stages, breeding and 
feeding. The one furnishes the raw material, the other 
finishes the product. Thus there are two groups of 
husbandmen, those concerned with the production of the 
animal machine and those engaged in the employment 
of this machine for the manufacture of animal products. 
There are, furthermore, two classes of breeders, one whose 
efforts are devoted to the breeding of foundation stock and 
the improvement of the race in general, another whose 
purpose is to supply the feeders from their studs, herds 
and flocks. The latter are obviously dependent upon the 
former. The breeder either may finish or work his own 
stock, as is usually the case with hogs and commonly with 
horses, dairy cattle and sheep, or may dispose of them while 
immature or thin to the feeder, as is the rule with beef 
cattle and range sheep. In some instances, therefore, the 
breeder is also the feeder, while in others the line between 
them is rather sharply drawn. 
The position of the breeder is fundamental and of 
primary importance, as he determines the grade of mate-

  rial available to the feeder; with good material insured, 
however, it is incumbent upon the feeder to make the 
most of the possibilities which the breeder has afforded 
him. 
1. Breeding for improvement. — Breeding, as we com- 
monly interpret the term, consists in regulating the progeny 
by controlling the parentage, to attain improvement. The 
constructive breeder aims at more than the mere multi- 
plication of his foundation stock; he strives for qualita- 
tive as well as quantitative improvement with each 
succeeding generation. Although improvement may be 
slight in each instance, the cumulative results of a num- 
ber of generations, the progenitors of which have been 
carefully selected, may be considerable. This has been 
the principal factor operating in the evolution of the 
domestic types and breeds of animals, mutations having 
been much more useful to plant than to animal breeders. 
The bases for the qualitative improvement to which selec- 
tion is made in the breeding of animals are, in most in- 
stances, characters which were originally possessed by 
them in their feral state and useful only for their own 
subsistence. Under domestication these natural func- 
tions have been perverted, readapted and developed so 
as to amply serve the needs and purposes of man. The 
motive governing live-stock improvement has been well 
expressed by Owen: ‘Whatever the animal kingdom can 
afford for our food or clothing, tools, weapons, and arma- 
ment, whatever the lower creation can contribute to our 
wants, our comforts, our possessions or our pride, that we 
sternly exact and take at all costs.” 
2. Selection is judging.— Control of the parents is 
accomplished by means of selection, and selection is 
judging. Proficiency in this regard is fundamental, for
-P-A-G-E-25
GENERAL VIEW 5 
without judicious matings the breeder’s facilities, resources 
and even the merit of his foundation stock count for little 
in the long run. The master breeders of live-stock history 
have all been judges of the first order. 
It should not be supposed that the activity of the agri- 
cultural schools in training students to become expert 
judges is for the sole purpose of supplying men qualified 
to tie ribbons in the show ring. Notwithstanding the 
fact that the placing of show ring awards carries with it 
great responsibility, since ideals and standards so estab- 
lished serve to lead or mislead the rank and file of live- 
stock breeders, the real benefits of accurate judgment in 
the show ring are not to be measured by ribbons, plate or 
cash. They are enjoyed by all consumers of meat or milk, 
wearers of clothing, and users of horses for either profit or 
pleasure. 
The breeder or feeder buyer constitutes the judge, 
whether he ever officiates in a show ring or not, and those 
who benefit by his judgment are the consumers of his 
product.

CHAPTER. II 
THE ANIMAL MACHINE AND ITS PLACE IN 
OUR ECONOMY 
Tue highest type of domesticated animal has been 
defined as the one which constitutes the most efficient 
machine for making the greatest return, in its specific 
product, on the raw material consumed. In this it bears 
an important economic relation to man as a source of 
food and clothing, and as an auxiliary in work. 
3. Economic purpose of animal machine. — Food with 
air and water are the three essentials for human existence. 
Food is that which builds up the body and furnishes 
energy for its activities; that which brings within reach 
of the living cells which form the tissues the elements 
which they need for life and growth. Only such available 
substances can be called food, no matter what their chemi- 
cal composition may be. Coal may be fuel for the fur- 
nace, but not for cattle; rough forage like hay may form 
the basis of cattle rations, but it is not available for man’s 
consumption. It is in the conversion of such raw mate- 
rials as are not available to man in their present form into 
animal food products or into horse power for his service 
that the animal machine serves a most important eco- 
nomic purpose. If man were to eliminate the fruits of 
animal production from his dietary, there would be of 
necessity an enormous increase in the cost of living, to 
compensate for the tremendous loss of the crops of the 
6
-P-A-G-E-27
  
THE ANIMAL MACHINE ni 
field which would be utter waste, or, at best, serve but 
for fuel if available only in their raw, unconverted state. 
4. Intermediate relation of animal to plants and man. — 
There are about fifteen principal chemical elements of 
nutrition. They are constituents of the human body, 
likewise the bodies of animals and plants; a few of them 
compose also the three requisites for the maintenance of 
life, — air, water and soil, the sources of food. We can, 
therefore, understand the synthetical relationship between 
man on the one hand, and the original sources of his sub- 
sistence on the other, with the plants and animals as inter- 
mediary factors. Some of the hydrogen and oxygen re- 
quired by man is obtained direct from the water he drinks ; 
more of his oxygen is taken direct from the air he breathes, 
and in return he gives carbon dioxide, equally essential 
for plant respiration. The soil, however, contributes to 
our support only indirectly through the bodies of the 
plants grown upon it. These plants also make abun- 
dant use of the nitrogen of the air, an important function, 
since nitrogen is a chief constituent of the protoplasm of 
the human or animal cell, both of which are helpless to 
draw directly upon the supply in the air. A great wealth 
of plant products are directly available to man in quantity 
and variety to meet his nutritive requirements, but the 
entire body of some plants and the major portion of many 
others are impossible for human consumption. The corn 
kernel, after a process of milling, becomes a staple article 
of food for man, but for every pound of corn there is ap- 
proximately a pound of stover, which would be absolutely 
valueless were it not for the ruminant’s ability to transform 
it into digestible, nutritious animal food products, meat 
and milk. We readily recognize the physical impossibility 
of a man’s consuming sufficient pasture grass or hay’ to 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
    8 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
sustain life, although the necessary elements are contained 
therein; yet from these materials are produced, in large 
part, the meat we eat and the milk we drink, our two 
most valuable tissue-building foods. 
It is with the view of securing the most efficient animal 
machines for the different kinds of production that the 
husbandman practices judging. 
Tue Function oF THE ANIMAL MACHINE 
5. Efficiency. — Mechanical efficiency is a matter which 
involves the character of the materials of construction, 
the perfection of the individual parts, the accuracy with 
which they are assembled, the power available for their 
operation, and the effectiveness of its application and 
control. 
Efficiency in the functional capacity of animals is 
analogous in many respects. Whether in the production 
of horse power, milk, a carcass, or a fleece, it involves and 
is directly dependent upon, first, the individual unit of 
structure, the cell, and its arrangement in the organization 
of tissue; second, the gross structure into which the 
various individual tissues are incorporated; third, the 
vital phenomena with which the tissues are engaged for 
both the maintenance and productiveness of the structure 
as a whole; fourth, the manner in which they are gov- 
erned; and, fifth, the significance of abnormal conditions 
of structure and the extent to which they may impair 
function. 
An elementary consideration of histology, anatomy, 
physiology and pathology, in their relation to the struc- 
tures and correlated functions concerned in animal pro- 
duction is, therefore, essential.
-P-A-G-E-29
  
THE ANIMAL MACHINE 9 
HistoLtoey 
6. Tissue. — Any tissue is composed of an essential 
unit of structure, the cell, and an inter-cellular material 
by means of which the cells are held 
together. The character of the cells 
themselves, their arrangement in the 
inter-cellular substance, its nature, and 
the proportion of each are what give to 
tissues their characteristic features. 
The animal body is composed of 
four kinds of tissue, 7.e. epithelial, con- 
nective, muscle and nerve. The general 
nature of each and its place in the 
organization of the animal economy should be fully under- 
stood in order to pass intelligently upon the relative struc- 
tural and functional merits of two or more individuals. 
; 7. Epithelial tissue. — The epi- 
thelial group is represented by 
the skin or outer covering of the 
body; the mucous and serous 
membranes lining the interior, 
the former those cavities in com- 
munication with the outside as 
in the respiratory and digestive 
tracts, the latter the closed cavi- 
ties of the chest and abdomen.

prises all those which enter into the supportive structure 
or framework of the body, such as bone, cartilage, liga- 
ments and tendons, and the interstitial tissue of all 
the organs. All of the connective tissues are more or less 
fibrous in character (Fig. 2).

voluntary and involuntary, the former represented by the 
skeletal muscles with which the judge is most concerned

in the matters of locomotion and meat production, 
the latter entering into the makeup of the heart, the walls 
of the blood vessels and the intestines, structures having 
to do with the vital functions. The characteristic feature 
of muscle tissue is its contractility, which takes place in 
response to a nerve stimulus (Figs. 3 and 4). 
10. Nerve tissue. — The nervous system is divided into 
a central, composed of the brain and the spinal cord, and a 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE ANIMAL MACHINE 11 
peripheral, made up of the nerve trunks and their nerve 
endings, which are distributed, in a most general way, to 
all parts. Nerve tissue has the property of conveying or 
transmitting impulses to or from the central station or

venience, into the trunk and the extremities. The trunk 
consists of the spinal column and the ribs. The spinal 
column is composed of individual segments of bone called 
vertebrae, which support the head at one end and ter-

the cervical or neck, the thoracic or chest, the lumbar or
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE ANIMAL MACHINE 13 
loin, the sacral or coupling, and the coccygeal or tail. 
The ribs spring from the thoracic vertebree and are 
attached, the anterior directly, the posterior indirectly, 
to the sternum or breast bone, which constitutes the 
region of the brisket in ruminants. The ribs inclose the 
thorax or chest cavity and a part of the abdominal cavity. 
Superiorly upright spines are developed from the thoracic 
vertebree, which give form to the withers or chine 
(Fig. 6). 
12. The foreleg. — The legs or extremities consist of 
columns, too, each divided into regions. The fore leg is 
composed of a scapula or shoulder blade, humerus or arm, 
radius and ulna or forearm, carpus or knee, metacarpus 
or cannon, the first and second phalanges which constitute 
the pastern, the latter more particularly the coronet, and 
the pedal, coffin, or foot-bone. 
13. The hind leg. — The hind leg includes the pelvis 
or hip, by means of which the coupling between the spinal 
column and the hind leg is made and which also forms the 
pelvic girdle inclosing the pelvic cavity through which the 
foetus has to pass in the female, the femur or thigh, 
the patella or knee, the tibia and fibula or lower thigh, 
the tarsus or hock, the metatarsus or cannon, the re- 
mainder of the leg being a duplication of the anterior 
extremity. 
14. The foot. — The region below the knees and hocks 
is anatomically considered as the foot proper, the appro- 
priateness of which is shown by a study of the analogous 
parts in the biped and the intervening stages in the rabbit 
and the cat. 
15. The joints. — The legs constitute supporting col- 
umns while at rest, but the extremities of the individual 
bones, opposed to each other in the columns, are furnished
-P-A-G-E-34
14 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
  with articular or joint surfaces by means of which one 
bone moves on the other. By the operation of the joints 
the columns are broken, the legs alternately flexed or 
extended, and locomotion is thus accomplished. The joint 
surfaces are maintained in position by the joint capsule 
and lubricated by the synovia secreted by it. 
16. The muscular system.— The skeletal muscular 
system is composed of the striated, voluntary variety of 
muscle tissue. Some individual muscles are long and 
thin, some short and thick, and others broad and flat. 
They are arranged mostly in groups of those having similar 
action, and may be in two or more superposed layers. 
While the primary function of the muscles is to operate 
the bones, they serve a secondary purpose in furnishing, as 
it were, the skeleton, giving form to what would other- 
wise be but a framework. This is much more marked in 
some parts than in others. The head, for instance, is 
but little altered in form or proportions from those of the 
skull, while all but the column of the neck is muscle, giving 
it a much better outline than it has in the skeleton; the 
form of the withers of the horse is but slightly altered by 
the muscles of that region, while the croup is made up of 
such a mass of muscle as to completely change the skeletal 
outline of that part. 
17. The structure and arrangement of individual 
muscles. — Each muscle has, in its relation with the 
bones, an origin where the fibers are attached directly 
to a considerable area of bone surface, and an insertion 
which is usually accomplished by means of a tendon into 
which the muscle fibers are continued. The tendon may 
have more length than the muscle itself, transmitting the 
power of the muscle a considerable distance before it is 
finally inserted. The extensors and flexors of the foot, for
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE ANIMAL MACHINE 15 
instance, terminate their muscular portions above the 
knee, the tendon continuing throughout the entire length 
of the cannon and the pastern before being inserted. 
The origin of the muscle serves as the fixed point toward 
which the bone on which the muscle has its movable 
insertion is drawn by its contraction. However, other 
muscles may fix the point of movable insertion when the 
action of the muscle is reversed. The long muscle con- 
cerned with knee action in the horse is an example in 
point. It has its origin at the side of the head and upper 
part of the neck and is inserted on the humerus of the 
arm. With the fixed point above, its contraction elevates 
and carries forward the arm and with it the leg, but with 
the leg fixed as in the standing position, its contraction 
may serve to incline the head and neck to one side. 
18. Muscular action. — Each muscle has a definite 
action, depending upon its position with relation to the 
joint and the nature of the joint surface itself. Hinge 
joints have their articular surfaces so arranged as to pre- 
vent motion in but one plane, as the elbow or hock joints, 
while others, as the ball and socket joints of the shoulder 
and hip, are capable of considerable freedom of motion, 
even to the extent of rotation. The action of a muscle 
is to flex or close the angle of a joint, when it is situated 
in the angle and behind the joint; to extend when in 
front of the joint or over the summit of the angle; to 
abduct or adduct when on the side of the joint away from 
or toward the median plane of the body; to rotate if so 
arranged as to cross from one side to the other in its 
course. 
All muscles are not equally employed. The .class of 
animals and the particular use to which each is put have 
much to do in determining which muscles are most fre-
-P-A-G-E-36
16 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
quently called into requisition. The delicate texture of 
the so-called tenderloin or fillet of beef is due to its being 
derived from a group of muscles, the chief use of which 
is in rearing, and since the unsexed bovine rarely rears, 
these muscles are so seldom called into play as to leave 
them practically undeveloped, and therefore very tender.

19. Prehension of food. — The taking of food comes 
first in an enumeration of the physiological processes by 
means of which ani- 
mals are productive. 
The chief prehensile 
organ in the horse is 
the lip, in cattle and 
sheep the tongue, and 
in the hog the snout.

  mences the digestion of some of the starches. This is 
continued after the food is swallowed into the stomach. 
Here also the gastric juices, with their enzymes, and the 
hydrochloric acid, continue the conversion of the raw 
materials of nutrition presented in the food into forms 
in which they may be assimilated into the blood stream 
and become available to the tissues and to such secreting 
organs as the udder. Digestion is completed in the small
-P-A-G-E-37
THE ANIMAL MACHINE 17 
intestine, where the pancreatic juice and the bile finish 
the conversion of the starches into soluble sugars and 
split the fats into fatty acids and glycerin, respectively. 
21. Assimilation. — Assimilation takes place chiefly 
from the small intestine after digestion has been accom- 
plished (Fig. 7), although some of the more indigestible 
constituents of the ration, as the fiber, undergo a special

fermentative disintegration in the large intestine, the diges- 
tible portion being assimilated from there. In ruminants 
the food is bolted and passed immediately to the rumen 
or paunch, where the fiber undergoes some fermentative 
changes, but it is later regurgitated to the mouth to be 
masticated at leisure after the supply has been secured. 
This is the familiar rumination or chewing of the cud, the 
cud being simply a mass of food which has been swallowed 
Cc 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
_ 18 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
once then passed back to the mouth from the paunch. 
It is eventually swallowed to undergo digestion and assimi- 
lation in the regular way, and to be replaced in the mouth, 
repeatedly, by other portions until the entire contents of 
the paunch have been disposed of in this way. The pig 
is unlike either the horse (Fig. 8) or the ruminating cattle 
and sheep, which are strictly herbivorous, it being omniv- 
orous, eating both vegetable and animal matter. It is 
also monogastric, having but one stomach like the horse, 
although it has much less capacity of large intestine, and 
is therefore much less capable of digesting a bulky ration 
than the horse. 
22. Circulation. — The blood stream serves as a transit 
system, through which the digested nutrient material is 
conveyed to the tissues and organs to be used for their 
repair and upbuilding in growth; to be stored up as a 
reserve fund of energy, as in the case of accumulated fat ; 
to furnish the essentials for glandular secretion, as in the 
case of the udder ; or to be utilized immediately, as energy, 
in the maintenance of body temperature or functional 
activity in the performance of work. Digestion com- 
pleted, it remains for the circulatory system to accomplish 
the assimilation and distribution of the digested food 
constituents. 
The circulatory system consists of the heart, which 
serves as a pump; arteries, which carry the blood, after 
having been aérated in the lungs and returned to the left 
side of the heart, to the tissues ; and the veins, which return 
the vitiated blood to the right side of the heart and from 
thence to the lungs, where the waste products, collected 
from the tissues, are discharged as carbon dioxide and its _ 
red cells are reloaded with a fresh supply of oxygen. In 
addition to the blood the lymph is circulated through the
-P-A-G-E-39
  
THE ANIMAL MACHINE 19 
tissues themselves without being confined within definite 
walls except in the main vessels. 
23. Nerve control.— The general function of the 
nervous system is to exert control over the functions of 
the other systems, codrdinating all movement and regu- 
lating all vital processes. The strength and resourceful- 
ness with which this function is exerted is expressed as 
nerve force, and is usually most marked in the highest bred 
individuals. Nervousness is no indication of nerve force. 
The whole nervous organization is comparable to a 
telegraph system, in which the central station receives 
reports and proceeds to act upon them in communicating 
instructions, for execution, to other parts, usually remote. 
Nerve impulses may be sensory or motor, and motor-im- 
pulses may be voluntary or involuntary, depending upon 
the character of the function involved. For instance, the 
horse receives a certain pressure from the bit representing 
an idea in the mind of his rider or driver; the sensory 
impulse is conveyed to the brain of the horse, from which 
is sent out the motor impulse which results in the execu- 
tion of the idea. 
REPRODUCTION 
24, Impregnation. — Copulation is the physical act by 
means of which the male germ cell, or spermatozoén, is 
conveyed to the genital tract of the female, there to meet 
the female cell, or ovum, recently discharged from the 
ovary. Any prospective breeding animal must be capable 
of it. The female will only submit to the male during the 
period of cestrum, or heat, at which time a Graffian follicle 
in the ovary is maturing and a ripe ovum is liberated. 
Conception takes place in either the body or the horns 
of the uterus (Fig. 9), depending upon the species, and its
-P-A-G-E-40
    20 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
occurrence, except in rare instances, prohibits the sub- 
sequent appearance of cestrum. 
25. Gestation. — The duration of gestation is usually 
correlated with the size and longevity of the species, being 
three weeks in the case of the mouse and twenty-two

-P-A-G-E-41
  THE ANIMAL MACHINE 21 
blood of the dam are passed by osmosis into the foetal cir- 
culation, through the arteries of the umbilical or navel cord 
and back through the veins of the same structure into the 
general venous circulation of the dam, to begin another 
cycle. By this means the foetus is nourished until after 
birth, when the establishment of respiration and digestion 
enables him to aérate his own blood and nourish his own 
tissues. All connection with.his mother is cut off with the 
severing of the cord, which takes place soon after birth. 
26. Parturition. — Parturition is accomplished by the 
general relaxation of the ligaments which unite the bones

girdle through which the foetus passes in delivery. A, coupling;

constituting the pelvic girdle (Fig. 10), through which the 
foetus must pass, and the soft structures of the pelvic and

presented head first, with the chin resting on the extended
-P-A-G-E-42
  22 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
  fore legs in such a way as to form a conical protrusion. 
This helps in the dilation of the parts involved as the con- 
tractions of labor gradually cause the expulsion of the 
foetus. Not only do the structures of the dam favor this 
expulsion by their relaxation, but the suppleness and 
flexibility of the foetus itself materially assists. The head, 
at this age, is capable of considerable compression and 
alteration in form to accommodate itself to the restricted 
passage through which it is forced, while the chest may 
have its vertical dimension flattened by the bending back- 
ward of the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebra, to 
which this dimension of the chest is largely due. In the 
case of multiple births, as in the sow, considerable time 
may elapse, with apparently complete cessation of labor, 
between the expulsion of each foetus. 
27. Lactation. — There is naturally a distinct correla- 
tion between reproduction and lactation. As pregnancy 
advances lactation diminishes, if the female is milking at 
the time, accompanied by a corresponding increase in 
weight due to the deposition of fat, in addition to the 
growth of the foetus. Some females cannot become preg- 
nant while suckling young. There is usually a complete 
cessation of lactation for a period prior to parturition, 
although some cows will milk persistently for years and 
can hardly be dried off, though calving regularly. With 
the approach of parturition the udder manifests a return 
of functional activity, “ springing,” as we say, radicating 
the increase in size and fullness of form most marked in 
females pregnant for the first time. Such udders finally 
secrete a characteristic waxy material, and finally milk, a 
few days or hours before parturition. After the birth of 
the foetus, the expulsion of the membranes constituting the 
afterbirth and the ultimate contraction of the uterus, the
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE ANIMAL MACHINE 23 
great volume of blood supply furnished the uterus and 
foetus is diverted to the mammary apparatus, stimulating 
it to the maximum of functional capacity, as noted in the 
fresh cow. The first material secreted by the udder differs 
both physically and ‘chemically from milk, being thick 
and yellowish in appearance and possessed of special pur- 
gative properties designed to remove the focal matter, 
meconium, that has accumulated during foetal develop- 
ment, as the first operation of the new-born digestive 
apparatus.

28. Abnormal structure impairs function. — The rela- 
tion between structure and function is intimate and re- 
ciprocal. Functional limitations are determined by the 
structure, while the development of the structure itself is, 
in a measure, responsive to the activity of its function. 
Carrying one’s arm in a sling continuously will cause 
such complete atrophy or wasting of the part as to seri- 
ously impair its usefulness, while the heart of the athlete 
undergoes hypertrophy, or an over-development, in an 
effort to meet the excessive demands made upon it. The 
removal of one kidney may induce a compensatory hyper- 
trophy of the other one. An active secreting mammary 
gland is “ dried off’ by arresting its functional stimulus, 
the milking process, while the rudimentary gland of the 
male, even, may be rendered capable of some functional 
activity by persistent stimulation. 
It is obvious, therefore, that but a slight structural 
defect may seriously impair the functional capacity of the 
part or the individual. It is not sufficient simply to 
detect the presence of an existing defect or abnormality ; 
its true significance, in interfering with the function of 
the part, must be foretold.

  CHAPTER III 
DEFINITION AND PROCEDURE 
JupGING is not an exact science in which determinations 
can be made with mathematical precision, but results are 
more or less approximate, depending upon the accuracy 
with which observations are made and the correctness of 
the judgment with which decisions are reached. Dis- 
crepancies may be due either to inaccuracy in observation, 
to error in judgment or to both. 
29. Judging. — Judging consists of making a thorough 
analysis of each individual, then measuring them to a 
standard — the ideal. Four steps are involved. 
30. Information. — First, information. In order to be 
consistent a judge must have a definite notion of what 
constitutes merit. Full information, therefore, as to indi- 
vidual excellence, market demand, and breed require- 
ments is essential to insure selection to the correct ideal 
or measurement to an accepted standard. 
31. Observation. — Second, observation. The study 
of animal form requires the keenest powers of observation 
to be exercised with greatest accuracy. The possession ol 
an instrument does not necessarily insure proficiency in 
its use; one may have acquired a definite mind picture 
of what he seeks yet fail to recognize it when it is seen. 
Observation is the application of the standard, the actual 
measurement of merit by means of which a close estimate 
or a careful analysis may be made. 
27
-P-A-G-E-48
  
    
28 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
32. Comparison. — Third, comparison. It is one thing 
to buy a carload of animals that must all conform to 
specified requirements, but quite another matter to pick 
out the first, second, third and fourth best from a car lot 
offering. It may be simple enough to make analyses and 
give descriptions of any number of individuals, noting 
carefully all commendable features as well as defects, yet 
most difficult to balance a superior head and neck, but 
low back of one, against the good back and deficient hind- 
quarters of another. The first described is observation ; 
the second, comparison. The judge must do this before 
he can ascertain, in the aggregate, the relative merits of 
the different individuals under his consideration and before 
he can arrive at a final conclusion as to their placing in 
competition. 
33. Conclusion. — Fourth, conclusion. The last step 
consists in weighing the evidence collected by the two 
preceding steps and returning a verdict thereon. 
When a decision is once made it is most gratifying to 
an exhibitor or seller, as well as most assuring to the judge, 
if he is able to give full reasons for having made the 
awards as he has done. 
34. System in judging. — The most comprehensive 
judging is secured by a systematic procedure. It is true 
many good judges do their work intuitively, but even 
intuition may be systematized to advantage. Judging 
must be done with a reasonable degree of dispatch, al- 
though time often serves to clear up certain points which 
at first seem obscure. The judge is, therefore, justified in 
using some deliberation, although his observations should 
be so conducted as to enable him to form a most definite 
and accurate impression in the least time. 
35. First impressions are lasting and, if made under
-P-A-G-E-49
  DEFINITION AND PROCEDURE 29 
_ normal conditions, are most likely to be correct. The 
judge should see to it, therefore, that the first view he 
takes will be fair to both the animal and himself. Ex- 
perienced showmen and salesmen appreciate the impor- 
tance of this first view in establishing favor for or preju- 
dice against the animal they are exhibiting. If they have 
an animal possessed of real merit, they endeavor to enter 
the ring at such a time, usually either first or last, or to 
take such a position as will insure the judge’s having one 
good, impressive look at the particular individual in which 
their interest is centered. This accomplished, they feel 
assured of careful consideration, in turn, with no danger 
of being smothered in a large class, as sometimes happens. 
Given an inferior animal, however, the attendant makes 
his entry as inconspicuous as possible among the others 
in order to avoid undue exposure of his exhibit’s worthless- 
ness, in the hope of being left in a higher position than he 
truly deserves. 
36. Conditions under which shown. — In order not to 
be misled in his observations the judge should understand 
and allow for the conditions under which the animals are 
shown. It seems to be considered legitimate to take 
advantage of everything that rightfully belongs to an 
animal so long as there is no real misrepresentation. It is 
perfectly proper to pose an individual for inspection. 
That is simply putting his best foot forward, as it were, 
and it enables the judge to better see him as he really is. 
Standing a horse uphill, for instance, accentuates his good 
points, yet there is no deception attempted, and to stand 
him downhill would be manifestly unfair both to the 
horse and to the judge. 
37. Posing. — The most extreme posing encountered is 
the so-called camping of horses. Practiced in moderation,
-P-A-G-E-50
30 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
camping is justifiable on the ground that it serves to keep 
a horse on all four feet, and is a protection to any one 
passing about him, since the horse must assume a natural 
standing position before he is able to kick or strike. 
Overdone, camping is unsightly and may be resorted to 
for the purpose of making a low back or bent hocks appear 
straight. 
Cattle and sheep should be stood up on their feet to 
enable the judge to get a good look at them, but they may 
be held in such a manner as to materially alter their lines, 
-handling qualities in the former and conformation in the 
latter. Such trickery can hardly be accepted as proper, 
neither can the holding up of a hog’s back by keeping 
down his nose in quest of corn in the litter of the show 
ring, after having taught him by experience to expect it 
there. 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  CHAPTER IV 
FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM TO BE CON- 
SIDERED IN JUDGING 
38. General appearance is determined by all those 
features which may be observed at a casual glance, and 
usually includes a number of the individual features here- 
after enumerated. 
39. Height or stature is a consideration in horses only, 
as a rule, in which it is measured at the highest point of 
the withers and is expressed in hands, four inches to the 
hand. Fractions of a hand are given in inches most com- 
monly, as fifteen hands, two inches, or 15-2, when the 
height is sixty-two inches. 
40. Weight, as registered by the scales, is not stated 
exactly, a unit of twenty-five pounds being the division 
usually allowed in the case of horses and cattle on account 
of possible variations of less amount being due to feeding 
and watering. 
41. Scale. — Height and weight combined constitute 
scale. : 
42. Style is especially marked in horses, constituting 
a most important feature of show, but greatly enhancing 
the appearance of any class of animals; it may be mani- 
fested by cattle, sheep and hogs as well as horses. 
43. Symmetry is the result of the balancing of parts in 
such proportions as to give an even, uniform, harmonious 
appearance of the whole. It is as though the assembled 
31
-P-A-G-E-52
  
82 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
parts had been constructed the one for the other rather 
than formed independently. 
44, Type is the sum total of those features the possession 
of which enables an individual to meet the definite re- 
quirements of special service or production. It is mani- 
fested by that form and contour which mark the distinc- 
tion between an individual that is blocky from one that 
is angular, for instance. 
45. Conformation.— Type has to do with the general 
structure resulting from the assembling of all component 
parts, while conformation involves the individual structure 
of each of these parts as a unit. The strength of a chain 
is measured by the strength of its weakest link, therefore 
defection in one part may offset an otherwise perfect 
structure. However, some parts, as the hock joint of a 
horse or the loin of a steer, for instance, have greater rela- 
tive importance than others; thus a deficiency in them 
would have more influence on the serviceability of the 
whole than a corresponding inferiority of structure in 
some other part. Appreciation of conformation, therefore, 
consists not alone in the detection of points, both superior 
and inferior, but in attaching to each due significance as 
bearing on the general excellence of the animal or inter- 
ference with its adaptability for the purpose to which it 
is to be put. 
46. Quality is that which pertains to the character of 
the individual unit of structure, the cell, and the propor- 
tion of them to the intercellular substance by which they 
are united in the organization of tissue. Quality is mani- 
fested in the texture of the tissue such as the hide, hair 
and bone especially, and by the general finish and refine- 
ment of the animal structure as a whole. Quality estab- 
lishes the grade of the animal structure and its products. 
   
-P-A-G-E-53
  FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM 33 
More highly organized tissues are the result of better 
breeding. 
47. Substance refers to the size and number of the 
individual units of structure and the gross amount of the 
tissue into which they are organized. It is manifested by 
the scale of the animal in general and the amount of any 
one tissue in particular, such as bone. Quality and sub- 
stance are not correlated, but more or less of each is essen- 
tial, depending upon the type of the animal. 
48. Condition. — An animal is in condition when in 
that state most favorable to the performance or produc- 
tion peculiar to his class or type. Condition is the result 
of fitting, a process involving a balance between feed and 
work during which the animal accumulates or reduces 
fat until the optimum degree of obesity is attained. In 
block animals and even in market draft horses the maxi- 
mum degree of fatness is desired, and its accumulation is 
favored by most liberal feeding of a wide, fat-forming 
ration and frequently almost complete prohibition of exer- 
cise, while the race horse and dairy cow are capable of 
their best performance when their normal amount of fat 
is reduced to the minimum by a course of exercise of their 
respective functions which is offset only by a carefully 
guarded narrow ration. 
49. Constitution represents such capacity of the vital 
functions, respiration, circulation and digestion especially, 
as will insure longevity, fecundity and maximum efficiency 
in performance or production. It is indicated chiefly by 
a large, open nostril, the spring and length of the rib, 
both fore and back, a sleek appearance of coat, an ex- 
pression of vigor in the eye and countenance and a general 
appearance of thrift about the animal, although the latter 
evidences of constitution may all be temporarily impaired 
D
-P-A-G-E-54
  34 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
  by ill health. Constitution is of greatest importance in 
breeding, feeding and working animals. 
50. Temperament is the term by which the nature of 
the nerve control over the functions in general is desig- 
nated. There are two classes of temperaments, first, the 
nervous, in which the nervous mechanism operates in such 
a way as to cause the animal to manifest an active, snappy 
manner, keenly alive to what is going on about him, 
possessing unusual nerve force and even nervousness; 
second, the lymphatic or phlegmatic, in which the nerve 
factor is apparently less acute, movements being executed 
more slowly, although preferably not in a dull, sluggish 
manner, and there is a marked tendency to feed and rest 
well with little inclination toward much activity or con- 
cern. Temperament is a constitutional, not a mental, 
feature. 
61. Disposition is the mental attitude of an animal, 
independent of intelligence, and reflected by his cheerful, 
willing, obedient responsiveness, or sour, crabbed rebel- 
lion. Disposition is naturally of most importance in the 
horse and dairy cow, animals in most intimate association 
with the husbandman. 
62. Sex character is the evidence, other than the pres- 
ence of the sex organs, of the one sex or the other. Mas- 
culinity is evidenced by an extraordinary development of 
the forehand or forequarters, the crest, the strength of the 
face line, the hardness of feature, burliness, and the bold, 
domineering manner, suggestive of the impressive sire. 
Femininity, on the other hand, is expressed by the absence 
of special development in the fore end, a lightness of 
shoulder and neck, fineness of feature, and a sweet, 
matronly expression and appearance. There is a correla- 
tion between evidence of masculinity on the one hand and
-P-A-G-E-55
  FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM 35 
both virility and prepotency in the male, on the other; 
while a female which lacks femininity may not only fail 
to breed regularly but an absolutely staggy appearance, 
associated as it is, usually, with more or less continuous 
cestrum and inability to conceive, has been due in some 
cases to the existence of hermaphrodism, in which there 
is a more or less imperfect development of the essential 
organs of both sexes in the same individual. The impor- 
tance of sex character is confined, of course, to breeding 
males and females, although stallions are sometimes 
favored for show purposes on account of the boldness 
which characterizes their performance. 
63. Breed character or type. — A breed is a group of 
individuals possessing distinctive characters not common 
to other members of the same species and so firmly fixed 
as to be uniformly transmitted. Breed type is the sum 
total of those distinctive characteristics by which the 
breed group may be differentiated, as size, form, peculiari- 
ties of: conformation, color and markings, shape of the 
head, and horns, if any, with the especial and distinctive 
features of performance or production. It is with these 
distinctive characters that the judge is concerned in the 
judging of breeding classes or the selection of breeding 
stock. Utility, however, should be the basis of distinc- 
tion. In order to maintain breed identity, all distinguish- 
_ ing features should receive consideration, but those of a 
utility character, which relate to performance or produc- 
tion, should be stressed more than such matters as color, 
markings, or the shape of ear, horn or snout. It has been 
stated that the best representatives of each of the draft 
horse breeds, for instance, should approach very closely 
to the same general type. It is most essential that they 
all be primarily of draft type, butif the only difference
-P-A-G-E-56
  36 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
between a Percheron and a Belgian is to be color, and not 
even color can be depended upon to distinguish a Clydes- 
dale from a Shire, what is the use of attempting to estab- 
lish breed identities? 
54. Factors determining breed characters.—As a 
matter of fact, these distinctive characters of breeds are 
the result of either or all of those agencies that have been 
operative during the formative period of the breeds. 
They are the foundation stock or the origin in blood, the 
environment by which these hereditary endowments have 
been molded, or the geographic origin, and the ideal or 
purpose to which selection has been made. The last is, of 
course, the final and determining factor in every case, and 
may be sufficient of itself to account for the differential 
features of two breeds. The judge is concerned with 
the origin, history and development of the breeds only 
in so far as they have been factors in the creation of breed 
type and character. There is reflected, more or less, in 
the typical representatives of the different breeds, the 
three factors which have influenced their development. 
Since there can be bred on, only such characters as have 
originally been bred into a breed, there are good economic 
reasons why these distinctive and useful breed characters 
should be recognized by the judge and their true signifi- 
cance appreciated. 
55. The best breed. — There is scarcely a breed of 
horses, cattle, sheep or swine that does not possess, by 
virtue of one or more of these factors, some one character 
in greater degree than does any other breed, and it is, 
on this account, better adapted to some particular per- 
formance or production. By. guarding zealously in our 
selections these characters, thus retaining the integrity and 
identity of the breed, we are insuring stock that is much
-P-A-G-E-57
  
FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM 37 
better adapted to meet the requirements of a wider range 
of usefulness. 
56. Objectionable breed characters. — Unfortunately 
not all features by which breeds may be characterized 
are desirable ones. Some most objectionable characteris- 
ties are transmitted with unfailing regularity, and it is as 
important that they should be recognized and eliminated, 
so far as is possible, as that the good features should be 
carefully retained. Fair treatment of all breeds, therefore, 
requires that these exceptions to the desirable breed 
character or type shall be noted. 
57. Way of going. — The way of going is a definition 
in itself. It is of principal importance in the horse, al- 
though the movements of all classes of animals are taken 
into account in judging. (The particular gait the horse 
goes, the features of the stride at that gait, the pace or 
rate at which he moves, the action displayed, and the 
manner in which he places or sets himself while going are 
all features of the horse’s way of going.) In the other classes 
of live stock it is only necessary to note whether or not 
the animal goes well upon his toes, with pasterns supported 
and without cramped hocks as in the case of sheep and 
swine, or, in such a way as to indicate absence of founder 
or weakness in hind legs, as well as to exhibit the style 
and animation desired in breeding and show cattle. 
68. (Soundness is that condition in which an animal 
is physically capable of performing the ordinary service 
of his type or class; anything that renders him incapable, 
in any degree, constitutes an unsoundness. ) Soundne’ 
is most commonly considered in connection with horses, 
but its meaning may be extended to include all classes of 
live stock. For instance, a cow that has lost one quarter 
of the udder, a hog that is so badly broken down in the
-P-A-G-E-58
    38 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
pasterns that he can only get about the feed lot with 
difficulty, or a bull with only one testicle in his scrotum or 
so weak in the hocks that he cannot mount a cow, are 
almost as much incapacitated as is the horse that is lame. 
59. Breeding unsoundness.— Any condition which 
may prevent a male animal from impregnating the female, 
or the female from delivering a live, normal young, con- 
stitutes breeding unsoundness. Furthermore, the posses- 
sion by a breeding animal of any condition which, 
transmitted to its offspring, may partially or completely 
incapacitate it, is also a breeding unsoundness. How- 
ever, the transmissibility of many of the so-called heredi- 
tary unsoundnesses has not been established ; even roaring 
and moon blindness in horses, the only two things for 
which stallions are disqualified in France, where the most 
comprehensive system of inspection is, are now believed 
to be more frequently the result of preéxisting influenza 
in the one case, and of an enzodtic infection in the other, 
than of hereditary influences. Yet, on the other hand, 
almost any unsoundness of a male or female may manifest 
itself in the get with more than casual uniformity, thus 
proving its transmissible nature. 
60. Defective conformation. — Unsoundness, or, more 
particularly, the defective conformation which predis- 
poses to it, is of considerable importance to the judge 
of any class of stock, but on account of the more complex 
nature of the horse’s function and the greater variety of 
conditions by which that function may be impaired, dis- 
cussion of the subject will be directed, chiefly, to the 
horse. 
61. Unsoundness in horses may be of eyes, wind or 
limb. Mental defects are usually included under vices. 
So far as show ring judging goes, the matter of unsoundness
-P-A-G-E-59
    
FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM 39 
is of no concern to the judge himself, it being settled ac- 
cording to rule by the official veterinarian, but one should 
not be wholly dependent upon the veterinarian for the 
detection and disposition of ordinary unsoundnesses. 
There is no difficulty experienced in diagnosing bad 
eyes if the lens has become opaque or the cornea clouded, 
yet serious conditions may exist in the eye without any 
such manifestations. These require the skilled practi- 
tioner to identify them. A diseased condition of any 
standing will result in atrophy or shrinking of the eyeball, 
just the same as a lame foot gradually becomes smaller. 
This reduction in size causes the eyeball to occupy less 
space in the orbit, with the result that it retracts deeper 
into the head, and the upper lid, not being distended by 
the eyeball any longer, looses its even curvature and be- 
comes notched with an angle. A widely dilated pupil 
or one that does not respond promptly to changes in the 
amount of light admitted, as when the eye is covered with 
the hand and then quickly exposed again, is suggestive of 
imperfect vision. 
62. Unsoundness of wind includes the so-called roaring 
and heaves. While roaring may be understood to be any 
kind of noise made in breathing, technically roaring is 
made upon inspiration only and is due to the paralysis 
of one of the cartilages of the larynx, that cartilaginous 
sound box with which the trachea or windpipe begins. 
Horses with bullish necks that are thick in the throttle 
and have a narrow angle between the branches of the lower 
jaw may make a distinct noise when pulled, especially on 
a curb bit, due to the compression of the larynx. This 
noise, like that due to pressure from any other cause, is 
most noticeable upon expiration and is relieved as soon 
as the horse is stopped and the head released, while true
-P-A-G-E-60
  40 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
roaring may continue till the breathing slows down and 
may even be induced by threatening to strike the horse. 
Heaves are detected by the violent expiration when 
the horse is exercised, the short, dry cough, the continual 
dilation of the nostrils and the double lift in the flank on 
expiration, the ordinary expulsion of the breath being 
followed by a second additional effort. 
63. Unsoundness of limb involves the structure of the 
foot, the bones, especially at the joints, the ligaments and 
the tendons. Founder (Fig. 12), the previous existence of 
  Fia. 12. — Shod and unshod hoofs in founder. 
which, unless promptly overcome, is indicated by the dip 
in the wall of the toe, the dropping of the sole, the un- 
even ringlike growth of the horn, and, most important of 
all, the peculiar going on the heels; contraction of heels 
or soles; cracks and thrush are of the first class. An 
exostosis is a bony growth, the result of an inflammation 
in the bone which causes a rapid throwing out of bone 
cells similar to the formation of ‘“ proud flesh ”’ in the soft 
tissue. Exostoses located at definite points are specifically 
designated as spavin (Fig. 13), when the hock is involved, 
ringbone (Fig. 14) high or low, when at the first or 
second pastern joint, respectively, splint when along the 
splint bones of the cannon. The seriousness of the ex- 
ostoses depends upon the extent to which the function 
of the part is involved. After the acute inflammatory 
stage has passed the exostosis may merely interfere me-
-P-A-G-E-61
  FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM 41 
chanically, by its presence, with the action of the part, 
all pain having subsided. In some instances, the process 
may automatically overcome the primary 
condition which caused it. If the ex- 
ostosis constituting a spavin or a ringbone, 
for instance, becomes sufficiently extensive 
to obliterate the joint about which it has 
grown, thereby preventing all movement, 
the pain of motion in that part and the 
coincident lameness will be removed. This 
process is called anchylosis, and accounts 
for the fact that a great big so-called jack 
spavin may cause no lameness, while the 
most acute pain and lameness will attend 
an occult spavin when there is, as yet, , 
scarcely any enlarge- * 
ment. The’ joints, in- F2¢- 18: = Lee z ts showing large 
volved in both spavin _ spavin. 
and ringbone are not 
the essential joints of those parts, and 
they can, therefore, be dispensed with 
and cause no serious interference with 
function. Exostosis is usually a sequel~ 
of or accompanies an inflammation of 
the joint surface, called arthritis, as in 
spavin, although it may be independ- 
ent of the joint, as in sidebone, and, 
usually, in splint. The lameness due     
  Fig. 14.— Leg show- 
ing ringbone at left; 
at right normal leg to an arthritis is most marked when 
Sao the horse is first taken out after a long 
rest preceded by hard work, and gradually disappears 
more or less as the horse “‘ warms out of it.’”’ The pres- 
ence of an exostosis is best made out by comparing the 
eo
-P-A-G-E-62
42 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
  corresponding joints or regions in the two legs. Many 
normal but rough joints may be suspected until it is de- 
termined that both hocks or all four pas- 
tern joints, as the case may be, are 
symmetrical. Any deviation in the nor- 
mal outline of the joint or bone that is 
not duplicated should be carefully investi- 
gated. This rule does not always hold, 
however, as two spavins or more than one 
ringbone may manifest themselves at the 
same time. The sidebone may present no 
enlargement or alteration in form what- 
ever, the lateral cartilage, normally elastic 
= and springing upon pres- 
sure, simply becoming 
Si FLee hard and unyielding as a 
ee’ result of the ossification. 
Ligaments are differentiated from ten- 
dons by the fact that they unite bone to 
bone, while the tendon unites muscle 
to bone. The ligaments most likely to 
become the seat of an unsoundness are 
the great suspensory ligament, which 
sustains the fetlock joint, on the same 
principle as a truss under a box car, the 
ligamentous structure at the back of 
the fetlock joint with which the sus- ¢ 
pensory ligament is related and the curb p,,. 16, — Le e 
ligament at the back of the hock (Fig. 15). . showing capped Pe < f hock. Rupture of this suspensory ligament is 
the “ breaking down”’ of the race horse. The tendons 
most commonly involved are the flexor tendons of the 
foreleg. If contracted, they cause cocked ankles and

  FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM 43 
sprung knees, while if some of their fibers have become 
ruptured and repaired by low grade connective or scar 
tissue they are said to be “ bowed,’”’ a common condition 
in race horses. Lameness due to sprained ligaments and 
tendons is usually aggravated by moving the horse instead 
of being relieved, to some extent, as it is if due to inflam-

stock the majority of whose lives are terminated after a 
short period of a few years, as beef cattle, hogs and sheep, 
is a comparatively simple matter, but in the case of the 
horse, which not only lives to a much greater age, but is 
valued largely on the age basis, and consequently invites 
frequent attempts at deception, the indications are more 
complex and difficult of determination. In the former 
group the order of eruption of the teeth is the primary 
consideration, wear being noted only in those breeding 
animals of advanced age, while eruption in the horse can 
only be relied upon until he is fairly ma- 
ture, after which wear is responsible for 
the changes which mark the ages. 
Distinction between the milk or decidu- 
ous teeth, which are shed, and the perma- 
nent teeth, upon the eruption of which 
so much depends, involves their size, 
shape, and color (Fig. 17). In all animals 
the permanent teeth are larger, less coni- 
cal in shape, have a much deeper root, 
a wider base and a thicker coat of enamel, F'6- 17.—A tem- : é A porary or milk

(Fig. 20). 
Four years. — At three and one half the permanent in- 
termediates come through and at four they are leveled 
and wearing. At this age the corner milk teeth mani- 
fest the approach of the permanent corners (Figs. 21 
and 22). 
Five years. — At four and a half the corners are shed, 
the permanent corners appear and at five there is the so- 
called full mouth, all permanent incisors being level and in 
wear (Figs. 23 and 24).

slowly. 
Nine years. —- The notch on the upper corners may have 
disappeared, the pinchers are round, and the corner teeth 
oval. The upper pinchers show wear, and the angle of 
the incisive arch is more acute. 
Ten years. — The cups of the upper pinchers are 
worn out and the angle at which the teeth meet has be- 
come so acute as to necessitate raising the horse’s head 
in order to look by the upper teeth to view the lower 
pinchers.
-P-A-G-E-73
  FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM 53 
Eleven years. — The tables of the intermediate uppers 
are worn away and the corners show wear. The lower 
corners have become round and the obliquity of the jaws 
is still greater. 
Twelve years. — The tables of all the upper teeth are 
worn, those of the lowers are dis- 
tinctly round and the angle of the 
jaw is increased. 
Beyond this age the indications 
of the mouth are based upon the 
increasing obliquity of the jaws 
(Fig. 31), giving a more-acute angle 
of incidence of the teeth, the in- 
creasing changes in the size and 
shape of all the teeth (Fig. 32), due 
to their being worn closer to the

mouths of second-hand horses that are offered for sale. 
It consists in burning into the table of the tooth a cup to re- 
place the one which has been worn out with age. Mouths 
are usually bishoped to resemble the appearance of the 
cups at 6 or 7 years of age. The made-over mouth can 
be detected by the fact that the appearance of the cups 
is not in accord with the angle or shape of the teeth. Un- 
less skillfully done the burned cup itself can be recognized, 
and there will not be the ring of enamel which surrounds 
the cup of the normal tooth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  54 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
67. Determination of the age of cattle. — The general 
size, shape and growth of the cattle as well as the ap- 
pearance of their horns is usually evidence enough to de- 
termine their age. It is only in case of disputes, as over 
the classification of show cattle, that the teeth are called. 
into requisition. 
The bovine teeth present some special features. In- 
cisors are not firmly set in the jaw cavity as in the horse, 
but are imbedded in cartilage in such a way as to permit 
of considerable movement. This is necessary on account 
of the fact that the teeth are not opposed by others in 
the upper jaw, but rather by a peculiar development of 
the gum to form a cushion against which the feed is 
crushed by the teeth of the lower jaw. Furthermore, 
the tissues of the jaw do not close down upon the 
roots of the teeth crowding them forward as their tables 
wear away, although this wear begins before the tooth is 
fully developed. 
At birth.— The calf usually has four incisors at 
birth, although he may have none, and the third pair 
appears about the tenth day, the last or corner pair 
anywhere from the seventh to the thirtieth day. 
These teeth are not leveled, however, until the fifth 
or sixth month. The pinchers are worn level at ten 
months. 
One year. — The first intermediate pair of milk teeth 
are leveled at one year, the second pair at fifteen months 
and the corners at eighteen to twenty months, at. which 
time the permanent pinchers appear. 
Two years. — The first pair of permanent intermediates 
is in at some time between two and one quarter years 
and two years and nine months. 
Three years. — The second intermediate pair has taken 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM 55 
its place at from three and a quarter to three and one half 
years. f 
Four years. — The corner teeth are in and the mouth is 
complete at from three years and nine months to four years 
-and six months. 
Five years. — The pinchers have commenced to wear 
level. 
Siz years. — The pinchers are leveled completely, 
both pairs of intermediates partly and the corners some- 
what. 
Seven years. — The first intermediate pair is completely 
leveled and the second pair is much worn. 
Hight years. — The tables of all the teeth are leveled 
and the pinchers begin to show a hollow which corresponds 
to the prominence of the cushion of the upper jaw. . This 
concavity appears in the first intermediates at nine and 
in the second at ten. 
There have taken place, meantime, alterations in the 
appearance of the mouth similar to those described in 
the horse. 
68. Telling the age by the horns. — The growth of 
the horn is a fairly reliable indication of the age in 
cattle. The first distinct ring appears at three years, 
and each succeeding year adds its ring so that two 
should be added to the count of the rings to determine 
the age. 
69. Determination of the age of sheep. — The erup- 
tion of the permanent pinchers takes place in the sheep 
at from twelve to fifteen months of age and the suc- 
ceeding two pairs of intermediates and corners follow 
approximately one year apart. At least this is the 
basis upon which the age of sheep is usually reckoned, 
although the exact time of the eruption of the teeth
-P-A-G-E-76
56 LIVE-STOUK JUDGING 
  involves fractions of years and months. Age is often 
expressed by two-tooth or four-tooth, as one pair of 
permanent incisors has appeared in one year, two pairs 
in two years. . 
70. Determination of the age of hogs. — Little thought 
is given to the determination of the hog’s age by his teeth. 
It is difficult, in the first place, to observe his mouth, 
and in the second place the indications are subject to 
much irregularity. 
71. Early maturity insures attaining full, normal growth 
and development at the earliest age. Animals may be con- 
sidered to have a definite period to develop in, rather than 
a definite degree of development to attain in unlimited time. 
If one does not make steady growth during this growing 
period, it will be deficient in development when growth 
ceases. Early maturity is indicated in any class of stock 
by weight for age and general evidence of growthiness 
and proximity to final development. 
72. Color has both a market and a breed significance. 
Certain colors enhance while others detract from the 
value or usefulness of certain animals. Gray horses 
withstand heat better than black, white hogs are especially 
susceptible to skin irritations, to which black hogs are 
usually immune. The color and color markings are the 
most striking features of breed type in some instances, 
as in the Hereford cattle. 
Color is a most convenient aid to an accurate description 
of an animal, a most important means of establishing 
identity, as in the case of pedigree registration. For this 
purpose the various shades of the individual colors, and 
the exact location, extent and outline of the white mark- 
ings should be accurately noted.

Tue Law oF CoRRELATION 
The law of correlation is one of the principles upon 
which the practice of judging is based — the correlation 
of form or structure and function, and the correlation of 
parts, one to the other. 
74. The correlation of form and function. — Actual 
determination of functional capacity, as in the horse race 
or pulling contest, the dairy or slaughter test, affords the 
most accurate and, in some instances, the only means of 
judging the relative merits of individuals. No one would 
consider settling a matter of speed supremacy in the show 
ring, for instance, but would send the contestants away 
in arace. It even happens that the awarding of the rib- 
bons in dairy and beef cattle rings may be somewhat 
reversed when the same classes are subjected to the real 
test in the dairy or the abattoir. However, it is not al- 
ways practicable to await the results of a try-out of relative 
merits in performance or production; the judge must 
estimate functional possibilities from an analysis of struc- 
ture and, if correct standards of measuring structure are 
employed, reasonably accurate results may be expected. 
The more complicated the function, of course, the greater 
the factor of possible error. 
Function is the end, structure the means. Function 
has its limitations. In the case of the finished block ani- 
mal, it consists simply of being a carcass of beef, mutton or 
pork, while in the case of the feeder, function implies 
doing something, and with the horse and the dairy cow 
doing may become a still more complicated performance. 
It is manifestly a simpler proposition to determine how 
a hog will cut up or a steer hang up by seeing them on foot 
than to estimate, from an inspection, how many pounds of 
   
-P-A-G-E-79
FEATURES OF ANIMAL FORM 59 
milk or fat a dairy cow will produce in a year or how fast 
a horse can trot or run. Asa matter of fact, the actual 
test is the only practical means of making the latter deter- 
mination, although even here an approximate idea of func- 
tional capacity can be had from the study of form. 
The novice is impressed with the rapidity with which the 
experienced judge will make his analysis of animal form. 
The detailed scoring of an animal, even by an expert, 
will require much more time than may be consumed 
in forming a very accurate notion of the sum total of 
the individual’s good and bad points. ‘“ Practice makes 
perfect,’ and the practiced eye can discern more quickly, 
but, in addition, consideration of the law of correlation 
enables the expert judge to cut corners, as it were. 
75. The correlation of parts. — One part is an index to 
other parts with which it is correlated. Thus the buyer 
of feeder cattle seeks out broad, flat backs as he looks 
down on them from his pony, or short, broad heads if they 
are faced about to himin the pens. A head of these dimen- 
sions will be found only on a low set, broad, deep and 
usually a thick-fleshed steer, while a long, narrow head 
indicates the reverse. 
As a rule, longitudinal dimensions of all parts are alike 
long or short and are inversely related to transverse and 
perpendicular dimensions. Hence a long-legged animal is 
long all over, head, neck and back, while inversely narrow 
and short ribbed. It is as essential to know what are 
not correlated as what are; quality and substance, milk 
and beef, power and speed are opposed to each other by 
this same law.
-P-A-G-E-80
CHAPTER V 
THE MEANS OF MAKING OBSERVATIONS 
76. The eye and the hand. — The eye and the hand 
are the means relied upon for making determinations of 
animal form and features; the latter usually being em- 
ployed to supplement the eye or verify what has been seen. 
The relative importance of the eye and the hand for this 
purpose will depend upon the sort of stock judged. The 
eye is almost exclusively depended upon in the judging 
of hogs, even the firmness of the flesh being ascertained 
by the lay of the hair. Next in order come horses, it be- 
ing necessary only to run the hand over the tendons and 
joints to note their texture and detect possible unsound- 
ness and to feel condition on the rib. Cattle are regu- 
larly handled : those of the dairy type to get the thickness, 
pliability, secretions and looseness of the hide, the amount 
and texture of the hair, the texture of the udder and the 
openness of the chine; while beef cattle are handled to 
determine, in addition to the features of the hide and hair 
already enumerated, the thickness, consistence and even- 
ness of the covering of flesh. Sheep have their form so 
obscured by the fleece and the fleece is often so cleverly 
trimmed as to require most careful handling in order to 
become informed of the details of mutton form and con- 
formation. Handling is also necessary in the examination 
of the fleece. Infact, in the case of the sheep the hand is 
60
-P-A-G-E-81
  
THE MEANS OF MAKING OBSERVATIONS 61 
almost as exclusively depended upon as is the eye in the 
ease of the hog. 
77. Method of handling. — In handling it should be re- 
membered that the tips of the fingers are most sensitive to 
the touch. The hides of cattle are rolled in the flat of the 
hand or between the fingers and thumb. The hide is most 
easily picked up over the back rib, the animal’s head, mean- 
time being directed forward, as turning to either side loosens 
the skin very noticeably on that side and causes a corre- 
sponding tightness on the other. Depth of covering in 
cattle and sheep is shown along the spinal column of the 
back and loin and over the top and side of the shoulder, 
regions in which the bone is likely to be most conspicuous. 
Sheep are handled with the flat hand, the fingers kept 
tight together, care being taken not to muss the fleece 
by turning down the staple. The fleece is parted for 
examination at three places, over the heart where it is 
finest, on the lower outside of the thigh where it is coarsest, 
and at mid-rib where an average of its quality will be found. 
A natural seam is selected and opened by the backs of 
the two hands, which are afterward reversed in such a 
manner as to press the fleece back with the palms, exposing 
the staple for its full depth, and the skin. 
78. Method of observing. — The study of the horse’s 
way of going is made by having him moved away from, 
toward, and by, the observer. By lining up the eye with 
the direction in which the horse is moving the directness 
of the stride is apparent whether going or coming, as are 
also the height of the stride, hind and front, and the 
working of stifles and shoulders. Viewed from the side, 
as he passes by, the length, height, spring, balance and 
regularity of the stride can be noted.
-P-A-G-E-82
  LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
System or Maxine OBSERVATIONS 
  Some definite system of making observations should be 
followed in order that each look may be made to count, 
and only one look be necessary ; if the views are taken in 
logical order from head to tail, for instance, there is not 
only less likelihood of certain points being overlooked, 
but the impression formed of the animal in toto will be 
more complete and accurate. 
79. Inspection.— Observations must be both general 
and particular. The first step in the inspection of an animal 
should be to take a general survey of the tout ensemble 
from such a distance as to bring the subject entirely 
within one’s field of vision, and thus permitting a considera- 
tion of its size, general appearance, lines, proportions and 
the symmetry of its parts. 
The particular observation should follow and include 
a minute examination, in order, of every detail, from close 
range. The order of this examination may be: face the 
animal from in front, noting the bigger things first, 7.e. 
width, height, size and carriage of head, then in detail, 
the proportions of the head, the expression of the counte- 
nance and the features contributing thereto, eyes, ears, 
forehead, face, nostrils and lips; then the direction of 
the forelegs, whether normal or showing deviations and 
what deviations, if any, with the conformation of the fore- 
legs and the feet. Pass to the side position and consider 
in profile such general features as top and under lines, the 
carriage of the head, and setting of the body on the legs; 
then in detail, the head in profile, the setting of the head 
on the neck, the length, shape and carriage of the neck, 
the blending of the neck with the shoulders, the direction 
and conformation of the forelegs viewed from the side,
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE MEANS OF MAKING OBSERVATIONS 63 
the back, rib, heart girth, loin, flank, croup or rump, 
tail, thighs and finally the direction and conformation of 
the hind legs and feet. From the rear view first, in general, 
the width and contour, then, in detail, the hips, stifles, 
thighs, lower thighs, and the direction and conformation 
of the hind legs and feet. Finally, inspect the other side, 
in order to determine whether or not the animal is sym- 
metrical. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
CHAPTER VI 
PRACTICE JUDGING 
  A THOROUGH study of animal form with full appreci- 
ation of its bearing on function as concerned in economic 
production is fundamental to actual judging. 
Judging implies comparison and competition, since 
selection is impossible when only one individual is pre- 
sented. It requires, first, an analysis of each individual 
under consideration. Then a comparison of each, in 
sum total, and finally competitive consideration, the 
good points of one being arraigned against the good points 
of another, the defects against defects, until a final and 
definite conclusion may be drawn as to their relative merits. 
80. Analysis of the individual.— A study of the indi- 
vidual should precede any attempt at comparative or 
competitive judging. The names, ideal features, and 
possible defects, with their significance, must be known 
and detected both in so far as the individual parts are 
concerned, and in their relation with other parts. Score 
card practice and demonstrations are most useful in acquir- 
ing this information. 
81. The score card, in this relation, is not to be consid- 
ered as a standard of measurement or a numerical ex- 
pression of merit as in the scoring of cows for advanced 
registration, but as a word picture or descriptive specifica- 
tion of the ideal animal. For this purpose the detailed, 
rather than the condensed, score card is most useful. 64 ;
-P-A-G-E-85
PRACTICE JUDGING 65 
  By means of the arrangement into major headings, each 
of which is divided into sub-headings, the student may 
become familiar with the individual parts and the regions 
into which they are grouped, with the names of each. 
The correct features of each part are specified in a brief 
description and the relative importance of each part in 
the animal organism is indicated by the numerical value 
attached thereto. Those which are most liable to be de- 
fective and most detrimental to the usefulness of the 
animal if defects in them exist are allotted the greatest 
number of counts. By continued practice with the score 
card, the student not only acquires a mental impression 
of the ideal, which eventually enables him to cast the 
score card aside, but he is also trained in making system- 
atie and accurate observations.

82. Demonstrations may supplement scoring, the 
subjects being chosen with the view of showing both de- 
sirable and undesirable features. Discussion should not

tion (Figs. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39). This serves the double

83. Comparisons. — After score card practice, demon- 
strations and discussions which perfect the student in 
analysis, exercises in simple comparison should follow 
by the introduction of more than one subject. Comparison 
involves not only measuring the character in question to 
the standard in the mind’s eye but carrying, in the eye,

the image of the character of one individual until there 
can be placed beside it, in the judge’s vision, the analogous 
character of another individual, so that an opportunity 
for comparison may be afforded. By repeated comparisons 
the ideal is gradually crystallized in the student’s mind, 
the good points being rendered more conspicuous by being

deficiencies becoming more marked in contrast with 
merit. 
84. Competitive judging. — Finally, but only after 
having acquired skillful method, keen perception, and a 
definite notion of the ideal, the student may be permitted 
to carry his comparisons a step farther and bring the dif- 
ferent comparable characters into actual competition, 
first covering parts or regions only, as heads and necks,

perplexities of ‘ placing” a class of animals before they 
have acquired the standard to which they are to select 
or mastered the art of applying it. It is interesting to 
note, in this connection, the different tactics employed 
in coaching student teams for judging contests. Some
-P-A-G-E-109
PRACTICE JUDGING 89 
trainers condition their race horses by repeated trials of 
as great severity as the race itself; others spend their 
preliminary seasons in perfecting the gait of their horses, 
balancing, biting and schooling, at the same time giving 
them sufficient work to render them physically capable 
of a more strenuous effort than they are, but rarely, called 
upon to make in their work outs. 
The latter is conceded to be the better method. So it is 
with the instructors. Some lay most stress on the number

of classes which their teams have had an opportunity of 
placing, notwithstanding that such placing may have been 
made under wholly unsatisfactory conditions, as when 
no chance is afforded for subsequent discussion. Such 
work tends to confuse and render chaotic whatever 
correct notions the students may have entertained. 
Others, and usually the more successful ones, spend the 
time after their team is chosen, which is usually on the 
basis of competitive judging, in demonstrations and dis-

cussions of typical and atypical representatives of the 
types and breeds, creating thereby a clearer conception 
of the ideals, more accurate powers of observation, and 
more logical judgment for making competitive decisions 
when the crucial time for them arrives.

  CHAPTER VII 
THE INDIVIDUAL 
Iprats are the bases upon which animals are judged, 
and they may concern the individuals, the types and the 
breeds of horses, cattle, sheep and swine. 
85. The horse, Equus caballus. — There is archeological 
evidence that the horse served primitive man of the stone 
age together with the reindeer and the dog, although there 
is no authentic historical reference to his use prior to the 
time of Joseph in Egypt, 1715 B.c. While the mare’s milk 
and horse meat have been used in a very limited way, the 
horse’s power and speed have been the attributes most 
commonly made use of by those who have subjugated 
and domesticated him. He is more than a simple beast of 
burden, in which field he was preceded and in some ways 
excelled by the dog, reindeer, camel, elephant, ox, ass 
and mule; he has taken a most important part in warfare 
and the conquests of nations, the elaborate ceremonies of 
church and state, the sports and pastimes of the people 
and finally in their agricultural and commercial pursuits. 
86. Performance.— The entire organization of the 
horse is designed to enhance his locomotion, and there is 
no domestic animal whose movements are so characterized 
by power, agility and grace as those of the horse. He is 
endowed with such mental limitations as to render his 
capabilities in locomotion most subservient to his master’s 
demands. The performance required of the horse is

not simply to be 
something, as in the 
case of the meat 
producing animals, 
nor yet as in the case 
of the dairy cow, 
which yields her 
body products, day 
by day, rather than 
accumulating them 
in a carcass, but to 
do various and often- 
times very complex 
things. The func- 
tional possibilities of 
the horse, as in the 
case of any other 
animal, can best be 
ascertained by study 
of the mechanical 
structure upon which 
these functions de- 
pend. 
87. The structure 
analogous with that 
of man. — The struc- 
ture of the horse so 
far as bones, joints 
and muscles are con- 
cerned is, with a 
few minor excep- 
tions, very closely 
analogous to the 
   
-P-A-G-E-115
THE INDIVIDUAL 95 
  structure of man, provided that man assumes the hori- 
zontal and quadrupedal position, and rests on the tips 
of his fingers and toes. The horse has no collar bone, 
the union between trunk and anterior extremities being 
wholly muscular, and the relative length of fore and 
hind legs is such as to maintain the body in a perfectly 
horizontal rather than an inclined attitude. He has one 
digit instead of five and rests only on the last segment of 
it, so that the wrist corresponds to the horse’s knee, 
the knuckle to his fetlock joint and the three phalanges of 
the finger to his first and second pastern, and pedal bones 
(Fig. 40). Likewise the knee of the man is the stifle of 
the horse, the calf of his leg the gaskin of the horse, his 
heel the horse’s hock, and so on as in the foreleg. As the 
man raises his weight well up on his toes and feels the 
tension of the muscles of the thigh and lower leg he can 
well understand what takes place when the horse “lifts” 
in the starting or moving of a load or in merely pro- 
jecting his own body forward, in locomotion. 
88. Mechanical structure. — The structure of the horse, 
mechanically considered, consists of a trunk suspended by 
an arch, the vertebral column, supported at each end by 
four vertical columns, the legs, the anatomical features 
of which have already been described in Chapter II. 
Greater weight is borne on the forelegs because the 
appended. head and neck bring the center of gravity well 
forward of the center of the body. The arrangement by 
which the body is slung between the two forelegs by the 
great pectoral muscles and the slope of shoulder and 
pastern provide for the supporting of this weight, especially 
during locomotion, with least concussion. The center of 
gravity being displaced further forward when the horse is 
in motion, still greater weight is thrown on the forelegs, 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
96 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
  the hind legs serving as propellers. The articulation of 
the thigh directly with the pelvis conveys the propulsive 
effort throughout the entire length of the spinal column. 
The supportive action of the forelegs meets the propul- 
sive action of the hind legs in such a way as to restore the 
equilibrium of the body. 
The joints of the leg are hinge joints, capable of motion 
in two directions only, flexion and extension, while the 
joints of the hip and shoulder, points at which the legs 
articulate with the body, are ball and socket joints, which 
permit of a rotary motion. The legs, generally speaking, 
are therefore capable of alternate flexion and extension, 
which take place in the order named, although the flexion 
of the leg as a whole may involve the extension of some 
one joint, as in the case of the shoulder at the commence- 
ment of flexion of the leg. 
89. The stride. — Flexion of the leg, which raises the 
foot from the ground, plus extension of the leg, which carries 
the foot forward until it comes in contact with the ground, 
again constitute a stride, and by the simultaneous or suc- 
cessive strides of the four legs, regularly repeated, the body 
is advanced. Each leg may engage in a stride inde- 
pendently, as in the case of the walk and the rack or single 
foot, in which the cadence is distinctly marked by four 
beats; one fore and the opposite hind leg may operate 
separately, while the other two act as one, as is done 
in the gallop, there being three distinct beats but of 
irregular cadence; a fore and a hind leg may move in 
unison and mark but two beats, as in the trot, when a 
diagonal pair are concerned, as the near fore and the 
off hind, or in the pace, when a lateral pair, as the near 
fore and the near hind, codperate. 
90. Deviations in the stride. — There is an active and
-P-A-G-E-117
  THE INDIVIDUAL OT 
a passive period in this form of locomotion which each 
leg or set of legs experiences in alternate order. One leg, 
a pair of legs or a set of three legs supports the weight 
of the horse while the other leg or legs is executing a 
stride. Hence, we can distinguish a supporting leg and a 
striding leg, and we find that deviations in the way of going 
may be accounted for by abnormalities operative during 
either or both periods. For instance, some lamenesses 
are manifested only when the leg is supporting, while 
others are characterized as striding or swinging leg lame- 
ness. A horse may interfere because of a base-narrow, toe- 
wide position, which places the fetlock of the supporting 
leg so near the median plane as to insure its being 
struck, but the likelihood of its being struck is greatly 
enhanced by the fact that the same defective position of 
leg which causes the fetlock to approach the median plane 
is also responsible for the striding leg’s being swung in a 
circle inward. This of itself might be productive of in- 
terfering, but to be added to the results of such a position 
in the supporting leg makes interfering doubly certain. 
On the other hand, the shortened stride of the spavined 
horse involves a condition which manifests itself in the 
striding leg only. 
91. The phases of the stride. — The evolution of the 
stride involves five distinct phases, a preliminary, during 
which the leg is undergoing flexion, but the foot has not 
left the ground,—the point at which the real stride 
begins ; next, the breaking over, in which the foot is raised 
heel first and leaves the ground by being rocked up and 
over at the toe, although at speed the foot springs directly 
from the ground, not waiting to break over at the toe; then 
flight, during which the foot is describing a more or less 
regular are of a perpendicular circle ; followed by contact, 
4 H
-P-A-G-E-118
  98 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
at which point the foot is again brought to the ground; 
and finally recovery, as the weight gradually falls on the 
foot and the original position of the leg is momentarily 
established preparatory to a repetition of the stride. 
92. The features of the stride which constitute the way 
of going. — The following features are manifested by 
the stride as it is executed, some being most marked in 
one type of horse, while others are more characteristic 
of another. 
Length, as determined by the distance measured from 
the point at which the horse breaks over to the point at 
which his foot comes in contact with the ground again. 
Directness, referring to the line of flight of the foot 
during the stride. 
Rapidity, which determines the time consumed in tak- 
ing the stride. 
Power, which the horse is capable of exerting in his stride. 
Height, the degree of elevation through which the foot 
passes in describing the arc of a circle in the stride. 
Elasticity, the spring with which the weight is borne 
by the leg and foot just before the commencement or just 
after the completion of the stride. 
Regularity, the machine-like order in which each stride is 
taken in turn. 
Balance, referring to the comparative display of any 
or all of the other features in hind as against fore legs. 
The sum total of these features as described by the horse 
in the succession of strides by which he moves constitutes 
the way of going. 
93. Pace. — Length and rapidity of stride contribute 
to pace; that is, the rate at which the horse moves. 
94. Action. — Height and spring of the stride mark 
action; that is, flexion of knees and hocks.

95. Gait. — A gait is a particular way of going charac- 
terized by definite and distinctive features, regularly exe- 
cuted. The gaits are: 
96. The walk, a slow, flat-footed, four-beat gait, which 
is one of the most useful if properly executed with snap 
and animation, whether in harness or under saddle. The 
walk should not be considered useful simply to afford the

horse an opportunity to rest, but should be regarded as a 
distinct form of locomotion, with as definite a purpose as 
any other gait which the horse goes. 
97. The trot, a rapid, two-beat gait in which the di- 
agonal fore and hind legs act together. There are three 
varieties of trot, viz.: the fast stepping trot, characterized 
by the length of stride and rapidity with which the indi- 
vidual strides are taken and constituting the gait of the har-

roll or side motion of the lateral gait into which saddle 
horses degenerate. 
98. The pace, a rapid, two-beat gait distinguished from 
the trot by the fact that the lateral fore and hind legs 
act together. It is characterized by the readiness with 
which pacers can get away at speed, more or less side 
motion (the so-called side wheeler), the absence of much 
knee fold, and therefore the minimum of concussion, and 
the necessity for smooth, hard footing and easy draft for 
its execution (Fig. 44). This, like the trot, is the gait 
of the harness race horse. 
99. The amble, a lateral gait distinguished from the 
pace by being slower and more broken in cadence. The 
natural amble is the foundation for the so-called saddle 
gaits, exclusive of walk, trot and canter. 
100. The rack, a fast, flashy, four-beat gait, well de- 
scribed by the discarded term:'‘‘’single foot” (Fig. 45). 
The rack is the gait which distinguishes the five-gaited 
saddle horse. While some display greater aptitude than 
others, few horses will rack of their own accord, or on 
the halter, but only when called upon to do so with 
both hand and heel, being ridden well up to the curb. 
It is preéminently a show gait characterized by con- 
siderable action and in many instances quite a bit of 
speed. 
101. The gallop, a fast three-beat gait in which two 
diagonal legs act together, their one beat falling between 
the successive beats of the other two legs, the hind one 
of which makes the first beat of the three. With the third 
and last beat, the horse is carried clear of the ground 
and there is a period of silence broken by the contact of 
the independent hind foot as it begins a new series of 
strides. The two legs acting independently, the fore,
-P-A-G-E-124
  104 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
with which the horse leads, and its diagonal hind, naturally 
bear more weight and are subject to more fatigue than 
are the other pair, which act simultaneously, and therefore 
share the work. The hind leg receiving the full weight, 
at the phase of contact at the conclusion of the jump,

bears more than the foreleg, which supports the weight 
alone, just before the projection of the horse at the begin- 
ning of the jump. The gallop may become so fast as to 
break the simultaneous beats of the diagonal pair, the hind 
foot striking first and causing four beats, although follow-

difficulty. 
102. The canter, a slow, collected gallop which the horse 
is made to do under restraint, the weight being sustained 
  
      
  Fic. 46.— The canter, the hind foot bearing the weight and beginning 
a new series of three beats at the phase of contact after the horse 
has been projected clear of the ground by the independent forefoot. 
chiefly by the hind quarters, while the lightened forehand 
rises and falls in a high bounding fashion (Fig. 46). 
Inasmuch as the canter, like the gallop, causes special 
wear on the leading forefoot, and its diagonal hind foot,
-P-A-G-E-126
106 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
  the lead should be changed frequently, a well-schooled 
saddle horse cantering on either lead at command. Cross 
cantering consists in so confusing the fore and hind leads 
that the simultaneous beat is of a lateral instead of a ' 
diagonal pair of feet, and this beat falls between the suc-

cessive beats of the other lateral pair, the leading fore and 
hind on the same side. 
103. The jump, either high or broad, is accomplished 
by the forelegs raising the forehand as the horse takes off 
in such a manner as to bring his body in line with the 
direction in which the jump is to be taken, when a strong

  propulsive effort of the hindquarters projects it over in 
the case of the high jump or across in the case of the broad 
jump (Fig. 47). Upon alighting the forefeet strike the 
ground first, the leading foot being a very little in ad- 
vance, the horse immediately gathering himself and strid- 
ing out of the way of the hind feet which follow quickly 
and come in contact with the ground slightly in advance of 
the prints of the forefeet. 
104. The running walk, a slow, single foot or four-beat 
gait intermediate in both speed and execution between 
the walk and the rack, and suggestive of a continued break- 
ing out of the walk. Whereas the rack is the show gait 
of the gaited saddle horse, the running walk is their 
business gait. At it horses make from six to eight miles 
an hour and it can be continued all day with no distress 
to either horse or rider. 
105. The fox trot, a short, broken trot in which the 
hind legs go more or less of a pace, the horse usually mark- 
ing the beats with his head and ears. It is used in place 
of the running walk in horses which take to it more kindly. 
106. The stepping pace, a distinctly saddle gait, 
should be differentiated from the ordinary harness pace 
which is a mark of degeneracy in the saddle horse. The 
stepping pace is characterized by little if any side motion 
and a somewhat broken cadence in the action of the 
lateral pairs of legs. 
107. The traverse, a side step, executed by both fore- 
hand and hindquarters, in response to rein on the neck 
and heel in the flank; by it horses may be brought up to a 
gate to unlatch it or to ‘“‘ dress ”’ in troop maneuvers. 
108. Factors influencing the horse’s way of going. — 
The particular features or deviations in a horse’s way of 
going may be due to either of two sets of factors, natural
-P-A-G-E-128
108 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
and acquired. The former class include type, conforma- 
tion, direction of leg and form of foot, all of which are 
governed by breeding; the latter embraces educational 
tactics, mechanical appliances, and the going surface, 
which are encountered in the horse’s schooling and han- 
dling. 
109. Type as a factor. — Type involves structure and 
structure is correlated with function, therefore a horse 
will do as he is. His capacity for one sort of performance 
will be limited, for another enhanced, by the plan of his 
structure; a long, lithe, angular horse will have more 
speed than power, while the draft horse is short legged, 
broad, square and compact. The stride of the former 
horse will be characterized by reach and extension, while 
the cobby horse, for instance, has a short but trappy 
stride. 
110. Conformation as a factor. — Conformation, involv- 
ing the details rather than the plan of structure, also in- 
fluences the horse’s way of going. The jumper has a 
straight hind leg short from the hip to the hock, while 
the pacer has a bent hind leg, long from the hip to the 
hock. 
Direction of leg and form of foot control the directness 
of the stride, the former determining the course that will 
be taken by the foot during its stride, whether it will 
be advanced in a straight line or describe the are of a 
circle inward or outward, while the latter fixes the point 
at which the foot breaks over, whether the center of the 
toe, the outer or the inner quarter, depending upon whether 
or not the foot is symmetrical or the inner or outer quarter 
is higher. 
The common deviations in the direction of the leg are 
classified as follows :

111. Breeding as a factor. — The features of type and 
conformation which determine the horse’s way of going 
are, in turn, matters of breeding which, in addition, is 
responsible for the mental factor which governs locomotion
-P-A-G-E-130
  110 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING, 
and is expressed by instinct. Instinct, type and confor- 
mation are usually correlated and not antagonistic. In- 
stinct, however, has a broader application in determining 
the specific gait that a horse shall go, rather than influenc- 
ing some particular feature of his stride. It is instinctively 
natural for trotting bred horses to trot, Hackneys to go 
high and Thoroughbreds to gallop. 
112. Education. — Instinct, however, is not sufficient 
to account for the record attainments in the various gaits 
of some horses. Education is necessary in order to make 
the most of hereditary endowments. Given the natural 
aptitude to trot, step high or gallop, a system of schooling 
is employed for the perfection of these gaits. 
118. Mechanical appliances. —It is in the schooling 
of horses that the mechanical factors influencing the way 
of going are resorted to. For instance, the snaffle bit, 
offering no opposition to the horse extending himself, 
is conducive to speed, and is therefore regularly used on 
race horses, while the curb bit, resulting as it does in 
restraint, is suggestive of a collected and high way of 
going, and is therefore of great assistance in the schooling 
of saddle and high-going horses. 
Weight influences the stride within limits; increasing 
the amount of weight in the foot, either by the shoe or by 
permitting an overgrowth of the foot itself, calls for an 
extra effort to make the stride, and therefore results in a 
higher step, although excessive weight will defeat this 
purpose. The placing of weight in the different parts of 
the foot, as inside, outside, heel or toe, does not make as 
much difference as was formerly believed. However, 
weight at the toe in the position of the usual toe weight 
attachments will, upon the principle of the pendulum, in- 
crease the length of the stride by carrying the foot out, 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
THE INDIVIDUAL 111 
  even turning up the toe, in extreme cases, while weight 
at the heel increases the height of the stride by requiring 
more lift on the part of the flexors. Hopples may be 
used to keep trotters or pacers in their stride or to con- 
vert from one gait to the other. 
114. Going surface. — The surface over which the horse 
steps has a marked influence on the character of his stride 
which may be taken advantage of in the schooling process. 
As a general rule, heavy, soft or deep going causes a high 
stride, while a hard, smooth surface is conducive to speed. 
Of the speed horses, trotters and pacers take more kindly 
to the hard track than the runners, which do best on the 
turf or a deeply scratched dirt track. The difference in 
the going will frequently account for a horse’s trotting 
or pacing, the heavy or deep going causing double-gaited 
horses to trot, while a change in footing will shift them to 
the pace. 
The common defects and peculiarities in the horse’s way 
of going for which any of the preceding factors may be 
responsible or tend to overcome are: 
1165. Forging — striking the ends of the branches or the 
under surface of the shoe of a forefoot with the toe of the 
hind foot. 
116. Interfering — striking the supporting leg at the 
fetlock with the foot of the striding leg. It is a common 
result of the horse’s standing in the base narrow, toe wide 
or splay footed position. 
117. Paddling — an outward deviation in the direction 
of the stride of the foreleg resulting from the toe narrow 
or pigeon toed standing position. 
118. Winging — exaggerated paddling in horses that go 
high, and consequently deviate more noticeably. 
119. Winding — a twisting of the striding leg, around
-P-A-G-E-132
  112 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
in front of the supporting leg after the manner of a rope 
walker; most commonly seen at the walk in wide-fronted 
draft horses. 
120. Scalping — hitting the front of the hind foot 
above or at the line of the hair against the toe of the fore- 
foot as it breaks over. 
121. Speedy cutting — in which the spreading trotter at 
speed hits the hind leg above the scalping mark against 
the inside of the breaking over forefoot as he passes. 
122. Cross firing — essentially forging in pacers, in 
which the inside of the near fore and off hind foot, or the 
reverse, strike in the air, as the stride of the hind leg is 
about completed and the stride of the foreleg just begun. 
123. Pointing —a stride in which extension is more 
marked than flexion, as is commonly seen in the trot of a 
Thoroughbred. Pointing also indicates the resting of one 
forefoot in an advanced position to relieve the back 
tendons while the horse is standing. 
124. Dwelling —a scarcely perceptible pause in the 
flight of the foot as though the stride had been completed 
before the foot reaches the ground, and noticeable in 
actors. 
125. Trappy —a quick, high but comparatively short 
stride. 
126. Pounding — hitting the ground hard at the con- 
clusion of a high stride. 
127. Rolling — excessive side motion of the shoulders, 
usually confined to wide-fronted horses.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE TYPES AND CLASSES 
TueERE are four types of horses, the division being made 
upon the basis of mechanics, each type being subdivided 
into classes in accordance with market and show ring de- 
mands. The four types are power, speed, show and 
saddle. 
128. The power type. — The service of the power or 
draft horse is to move the maximum load under minimum 
pace requirements and usually over the paved surfaces 
of traffic congested city streets. — 
Stability of equilibrium is the measure of power; there- 
fore, the essential features of power horse type are those 
which contribute to or insure stability of equilibrium and 
muscular development. Factors to the former are 
weight, low station and breadth of body; to the latter, 
compactness, massiveness and bone, while depth, which 
is correlated with breadth and compactness, is a feature 
of stamina by which continuous service is sustained. 
The power horse (Fig. 48) should weigh from 1500 to 
2400 pounds in order to have sufficient friction be- 
tween his shoe and the hard surface of the street to 
give him a secure footing. Furthermore, weight thrown 
into the collar effectively supplements muscular exertion. 
Low station, determined by shortness of legs, increases 
the stability of equilibrium by bringing the center of 
gravity as near as possibile to the base of support, that 
I 113
-P-A-G-E-134
114 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
area of surface upon which the horse stands, included 
within lines connecting the four points of contact, his 
feet. Length of leg in turn is largely a matter of length 
of cannon, and a short cannon is correlated with breadth, 
depth and compactness, all features of the power type. 
  
      
Fra. 48. — The power horse type. 
Breadth, involving primarily the skeleton, increases the 
base of support laterally, thereby giving greater stability 
of balance, and it also insures skeletal foundation for 
the development of a greater muscular system. Depth, 
directly related to heart, lung and digestive capacity, is 
essential in order that the horse shall be capable of main- 
taining a continuous supply of energy throughout his
-P-A-G-E-135
THE TYPES AND CLASSES 115 
long hours of arduous duty. 
Compactness, the result of a 
short vertebral column, brings 
the source of power, the hind- 
quarter, closer to the point at 
which the power is applied, 
the shoulder, thereby mak- 
ing for strength and rigidity 
of the shaft and minimizing 
loss in transmission. Massive 
is almost synonymous with 
muscular, and a massive ap- 
pearance is suggestive of 
power, as it indicates extreme 
development of the short, 
thick, bulky power variety of 
muscles. The strength of the 
bone should correspond to 
the contracting force of the 
muscle. The power horse 
should, therefore, have a 
framework of heavy but dense, 
clean bone (Fig. 49). The 
joint surfaces, also, should be 
of such area as to withstand 
the stress of the powerful con- 
traction of the muscles upon 
the bones whose ends they 
oppose. Furthermore, the 
symmetrical appearance of Fic. 49.—Frontal section of 
large metatarsal (hind can- 
non) bone of horse, posterior 
part. S.c., compact substance; S.s., spongy substance; C.m., medullary

pact substance of the inner and anterior parts of the shaft.

129. Conformation of the draft horse. — The distinctive 
features of the conformation of the draft horse are: 
  
a 
  
             
   head of such size as will balance the other features of a
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE TYPES AND CLASSES 117 
big horse, yet not manifest coarseness or low breeding ; 
a neck that has sufficient length and shape to fit a collar 
well, though strong and muscular; broad, muscular 
withers; a shoulder with as much length and slope as is 
consistent with a short-legged, heavy-set horse; a broad 
muscular arm and fore arm; a wide, deep knee affording 
ample joint surface, the size of the horse considered; a 
short, broad, flat, clean cannon bone; a pastern of as much 
length and slope as will support the weight of a draft horse 
without sagging; a full, round, smooth coronet, elastic 
cartilages; and a foot that is large in proportion to the 
size of the horse, of half-flat shape, so as to insure greatest 
circumference and ground-gripping surface, yet strong in 
the heels and bars, with an arched sole which shows no 
tendency to drop or become too flat, as many draft horse feet 
do, and of such dense, smooth horn as will insure against 
the shelly, brittle hoofs to which draft horses are heir; a 
short, broad, straight back ; round, deep rib; short, broad, 
thick, level loin ; full flank ; smooth, short, strong coupling ; 
long, level, broad and muscular croup; thick thigh and 
stifle; muscular gaskin; broad, deep, smooth, straight, 
clean-cut hock ; with the same sort of hind cannon, pastern 
and foot as described for the front leg, the hind pasterns 
of draft horses showing a marked tendency to be steep. 
The legs should be set one under each corner, not on 
each corner, giving the bull dog effect that is noticeable in 
some very wide-fronted horses. The elbow should be in, 
not out. The hocks cannot be expected to be very close 
together in a horse that has much thickness of thigh, but 
hocks that are wide apart are defective. The four legs 
should line up straight from either side or end view. 
130. Quality in the draft horse. — While not contribut- 
ing to power, it is essential that the draft horse should
-P-A-G-E-138
  118 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
  possess quality, as indicated in texture of bone, hoof and 
hair, and refinement of head and neck, in order to increase 
the wearing properties and to improve the general appear- 
ance. Quality is not natural to the draft horse, since he 
is primarily gross, but as much as is consistent with the 
required substance should be sought. 
131. Temperament of the draft horse. — The nature of 
the work of the draft horse requires that he be steady and 
easily handled, hence his lymphatic temperament stands 
him in good stead, unless it makes him absolutely sluggish, 
which he should not be. 
132. Way of going of the draft horse. — Since the most 
approved systems of draft horse management prescribe 
that he shall work at the walk, it is important that the walk, 
in his case, should be developed to its greatest possibilities. 
He should move at this gait with a powerful, yet snappy, 
free and true stride. He may be trotted for inspection, be- 
cause the trot magnifies all features of the walk, and for a - 
draft horse to be able to trot well gives assurance of 
mechanical excellence which will serve him equally well 
at the walk. 
133. The speed type (Fig. 51).— This type is extremely 
opposed to the horse that has already beendescribed. Speed 
performance calls for maximum pace with a minimum 
impost of weight to be pulled or carried. Instability of 
equilibrium is the measure of speed; therefore, the type 
in general is one in which there is the least opposition to 
the rapid‘and repeated displacement of the center of 
gravity which takes place with each stride and in the direc- 
tion of the leading foot. In addition to the rapidity with 
which successive strides can be taken, the length of the indi- 
vidual strides determines thespeed. Muscular contraction, 
therefore, must be greatest in degree as well as most quickly  
-P-A-G-E-139
    
THE TYPES AND CLASSES 119 
accomplished, and the sort of muscles that are capable of 
such contraction are long, narrow and bandlike compared 
to the short, thick muscles of power. Instability o' 
equilibrium as well as length of stride are favored in the 
horse that is long and rangy in order to have length in his

stride ; lithe as the result of his muscular system consisting 
of muscles of the speed sort ; angular for the same reason, 
his form not being rounded out by the bulk of his muscles, 
nor by excess weight in fat; narrow to permit of the 
greatest directness of shoulder motion, as a narrow base of 
support is in line with a rapid displacement of the center of
-P-A-G-E-140
  120 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
gravity, and to minimize wind resistance; deep to secure 
the heart, lung and digestive capacity which his perform- 
ance necessitates, and yet which cannot be had by width. 
134. Conformation of the speed horse. — The special 
features of speed conformation are enumerated in differen- 
tiating trotters, pacers and runners. (Paragraph 137.) 
135. Quality in the speed horse. — Quality in the 
speed type is not only indicative of the structure’s capacity 
to withstand wear and tear, but insures durability with 
least weight and bulk. 
136. Temperament of the speed horse. — A nervous 
temperament is requisite to speed performance afford- 
ing the nerve force and courage that is required to control 
and sustain the performance of which the speed horse is 
mechanically capable. 
137. Way of going of the speed horse. — Horses of 
the speed type may be either trotters, pacers or runners. 
Trotters and pacers, both going two beat gaits in harness, 
have much in common to distinguish them from runners, 
which attain speed under saddle at an altogether different 
gait, yet in some features, trotters and pacers them- 
selves are quite different. As a group they are distin- 
guished from the runner by a greater proportionate length 
of forearm and lower thigh, a different set to the hind leg, 
there being a greater tendency to a downward and 
forward deviation in trotters and pacers and less develop- 
ment of the forehand. Of the two, the pacer has greater 
length of leg in proportion to the body, a longer, steeper 
croup and more bent hocks. The runner is characterized 
by greater development of the forehand, a much straighter 
hind leg with less proportionate length from the hip joint 
to the hock, a somewhat thicker stifle and a way of standing 
easy on his front legs.
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE TYPES AND CLASSES 121 
138. The show type (Fig. 52).— So far as speed and 
power are concerned, show horse requirements are inter- 
mediate. It is the manner in which he moves and the 
  
me 
      
Fic. 52. — The show horse type. 
appearance he makes while going rather than the pace or 
the weight of the load which counts. 
These features are best obtained in a horse of a close and 
full-made form viewed from the side and end, respectively, 
because such a one possesses the rotundity and smoothness
-P-A-G-E-142
122 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
  that fits heavy harness best and conforms to the lines of 
the heavy vehicles to which the show horse is put. 
139. Conformation of the show horse. — His conforma- 
tion is distinctive. In no type do good looks count more, 
and beauty of form involves conformation. Furthermore, 
certain structural features not only enhance general 
appearance, but are essential to the kind of performance 
required of the show horse. The head should be fine, 
especially about the ears, and so put on such a shapely 
neck as to permit of extreme flexion at this point, such as 
takes place when the horse places himself when going. 
Length, as well as shape of neck is essential to suppleness, 
the show horse being compelled to bend himself readily in 
every joint. On account of the full-made form the withers 
will not be set up to the same extent as in the saddle horse, 
but a long, sloping shoulder and a comparatively light 
forehand are requisite to action. In the same way long, 
sloping pasterns contribute to height and elasticity of 
stride. A high-set tail is effective in setting off a high 
stepper’s performance, and it can only be had on a long, 
level, smoothly turned croup. 
140. Quality, temperament and way of going of the 
show type. — Quality in the extreme as an important 
adjunct to finish and good looks, and a temperament that 
is proud, bold and stylish in order that his performance 
may be in line with his physical features and the purpose 
to which he is put are important. 
141. The saddle type. — The saddle horse (Fig. 53) not 
only has to carry weight of from 135 to 200 pounds or over, 
but he is required to do it in such a manner as to afford 
satisfaction to his rider and incur no distress to himself. 
The various gaits at which the weight is carried serve to dif- 
ferentiate the classes of saddle horses. Ability to support 
' 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
THE TYPES AND CLASSES 123 
weight depends upon a short-span arch, represented in a 
short, closely coupled back and loin, resting upon strong 
columns—short, stout legs. To carry the weight, the horse 
  
  
    
Fic. 53.— The saddle horse type. 
is required to move in balance, collecting himself under 
his load, going well off his hocks and keeping his legs 
under him as much as possible in order to be supporting 
the weight at all phases of the stride. The big horse is 
not necessarily the weight carrier ; unless he is properly set 
up, his own size may be an encumbrance to him, while 
many ponies, by virtue of their distinctly weight-carrying 
build, are capable of much more than would be expected 
of them.  
-P-A-G-E-144
  124 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
142. Conformation of the saddle horse. — Special 
conformation requirements of the saddle type are a saddle 
back, short, straight and strong; a light forehand insuring 
handiness in carrying weight, a heavily fronted horse not 
only giving a rough ride but being a blunderer, as a rule; a 
long, sloping shoulder, longer than in any other type of horse, 
to give a free, springy stride; and high withers, extend- 
ing well back, the result of the long, sloping shoulders and 
serving to keep both saddle and rider from working for- 
ward, giving the impression of much horse in front of the 
rider, forming the narrow front which affords the most 
secure seat by favoring thigh and knee grip and ob- 
viating the difficulty of a wide spread of legs, and prevent- 
ing the turning of the saddle. Such shoulders and withers 
are correlated with the long, supple neck so essential in 
the saddle horse. 
143. Quality of the saddle horse. — Quality, combined 
with substance, is desired in the saddle horse, quality 
being especially required of the park saddle classes, while 
substance is necessary for carrying weight. Quality 
is characteristic of the blood lines in which most 
saddle horses are bred; substance is therefore most apt 
to be deficient. 
144. Way of going of the saddle horse. — The stride of 
the saddle horse is distinguished by elasticity, especially, 
and the safety of the rider demands that he be sure-footed. 
145. Intelligence of the saddle horse.—A _ well- 
schooled saddle horse should be thoroughly responsive 
to the hand of the rider on his mouth, the rein on his neck 
and the heel on his side; he should change gaits, canter on 
either lead, or in a circle, back and traverse at command, 
all of which requires a responsive mouth and intelligence of 
a high order.

146. The drafter. — The truest exponent of the power 
type already described. There is some distinction to be 
| made, however, between the market draft gelding (Fig. 54) 
and the extreme of the power type. In considering the 
essential features of power, height is of much less importance 
than weight and station, but in the selection of draft geld- 
ings height is more important. The draft horse market is 
ruled by buyers who make the appearance of their teams

put to the large trucks and vans, the low-down horse will 
appear squatty, and the effect of the entire equipage will 
be marred. Drafters are worked singly, in pairs, threes, 
fours and sixes. 
147. The logger. — Briefly, a draft horse minus quality, 
being coarse, unsymmetrical, low bred or badly enough 
blemished to be disqualified for the city trade, and taken 
for service in the woods where power only counts. 
148. The chunk.— A drafter minus scale, being the 
extreme of draft form as indicated by his name, but under 
weight, usually ranging from 1200 to 1500 pounds (Fig. 55). 
He is handier for the rough work of farmers and contractors 
and the more rapid hauling that is required in the delivery 
service of breweries and such concerns than the typical 
drafter. 
149. The expresser. — A rapid draft horse, capable of

doing his work at the trot. He is on the line between the 
work horse and the heavy harness horse divisions so far 
as his makeup is concerned, embracing some of the size 
and substance of the draft horse with more of the shape 
and finish of the heavy harness horse (Fig. 56). Expressers 
vary in weight from 1250 to 1500 pounds and are some- 
times subclassified into light and heavy delivery. 
150. The feeder.— Any thin horse bought for the 
purpose of fattening may be properly termed a feeder, 
but as this practice is limited to horses in the work division, 
the typical feeder belongs to the draft class or one of its 
subclasses. 
Heavy Harness Division 
These horses conform to the show type and include the 
coach horse, the park horse, the cob and the runabout 
horse. 
151. The coach horse. — A horse of sufficient size and 
substance to pull a brougham or road coach (Fig. 57), yet 
possessing enough quality, style and action to make a 
good appearance. Twelve hundred pounds weight, sixteen 
hands height, is standard size. They are required to make 
a good show while going about an eight-mile pace, and 
be well enough mannered to go anywhere through city 
traffic or stand in pose for long waits. Coach horses 
are put to the brougham, laudau or, as wheelers 
especially, to the park drag or road coach, singly, in pairs, 
unicorn (three), four, or five when cock horse is used. 
152. The park horse is the most typical representative 
of the show type. He should be able to go, flashily, a 
pace of twelve miles an hour with a most extravagant 
flexion of knees and hocks. Park horses are driven singly, 
in pairs and fours, put to the gig, the Sayler wagon, demi-

park drag and Victoria, owners to drive, usually, in all 
but the last instance. They are classified by height. 
158. The cob is best described as a big, little, ride or 
drive, horse. He exemplifies the close, full-made form 
and high action of the show type, but has unusual bone 
and muscular development in his comparatively short 
legs. The typical cob is so extremely close and full made 
that the term cobby is used to denote such a form. The 
cob is intermediate between the heavy harness and pony 
divisions. 
154. The runabout horse. — The nature of his service 
is indicated by the name of the vehicle to which he is 
put, and handiness is his most essential feature. To this 
end he should be small, not over 15 hands 1 inch, as a rule, 
and combine some of the step of the road horse with some 
of the shape and action of the park horse, although extreme 
action is not typical of this class. Runabout horses should 
stand without hitching, back readily, and display the best 
of manners at all times (Fig. 59). This horse may be 
considered intermediate between the heavy harness and 
the light harness divisions. 
Licgut Harness Division 
This division consists of roadsters and speed horses, the 
latter of which may be either trotters or pacers. 
155. The roadster (Fig. 60) typifies the trotter described 
under the speed type, but is required, in addition, to be of 
good size and conformation and to have somestyle, asmooth 
gait, even though not possessed of extreme speed, and the 
best of manners. Pacers are not generally recognized in 
road classes on account of the fact that they pull a wagon 
unsteadily over any but the best of going, their side motion

is considered unsightly, and they are too susceptible, 
in their gait, to the various kinds of footing. 
156. The speed horse may be either a trotter or a pacer 
possessed of sufficient speed, stamina and gameness, to 
render him a successful race horse. Unfortunately speed 
performance alone is about all that counts, although the 
better class of speed horses conform very closely to the 
road horse just described, possessing extreme speed in 
addition. 
Road horses are hitched singly or in pairs to the Ameri- 
can road wagon, while speed horses are hooked to sulkies 
or speed wagons, depending upon whether or not amateur 
rales obtain. 
Sappte Horse Division 
The saddle horse division embraces the race horse or 
runner, the gaited saddle horse, the walk-trot-canter 
saddle horse, the hunter and the combination horse. 
157. The race horse is of most extreme speed type, 
but is used exclusively under saddle. He is a natural 
galloper, having a wonderful reach and length of jump at 
the run, but a low, pointing stride at the trot. Running 
races are conducted on the flat or over the jumps of the 
steeple-chase course, some horses showing a natural apti- 
tude for the jumps, whereas others cannot even be schooled 
to take them successfully. Runners are handicapped by 
the weight which they are required to carry. 
158. The gaited saddle horse (Fig. 61). — Since instinct 
to go certain gaits is hereditary, and only those horses which 
instinctively go certain gaits can be schooled to a satis- 
factory performance at them, the majority of gaited saddle 
horses are Saddle bred, and conform to the description of the 
Saddle-bred horse given elsewhere. Performance, the
-P-A-G-E-156
  136 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
basis upon which they are classified, requires them to go 
at least five gaits, i.e. the walk; either the running walk,

fox trot or stepping pace; the trot; the rack; and the 
canter. See pages 99-107. They carry full mane and tail 
and represent the southern and western idea of a saddle 
horse. 
159. The walk-trot-canter saddle horse. — This class 
may be subdivided into the American or Saddle bred and 
the English or Thoroughbred saddle types (Fig. 62). The
-P-A-G-E-157

former is distinguished from the gaited saddle horse only 
by the fact that he either has not been schooled or is not 
permitted to go more than the three gaits and is usually

docked and has his mane pulled. The Thoroughbred type 
(Fig. 63), representing the English idea, is a well-shaped, 
good-headed Thoroughbred that is not characterized by 
the usual pointy trot, but can trot in the collected, 
springy, weight carrying way that is required of the 
saddle horse. They are usually undocked but have their 
manes hogged.

Fic. 63. — The Thoroughbred type of walk-trot-canter saddle horse. 
160. The hunter.— This horse is required to carry 
weight cross country after fox hounds, which necessitates 
his jumping safely any obstacle likely to be encountered 
in a cross-country run, having stamina sufficient to stay 
with the pack as long as they run and to be able to 
gallop fast enough to follow the hounds. He must 
have a good head to keep a steady hunting clip and be at 
all times under the complete control of his rider. The 
hunter is a weight carrying saddle horse in the extreme 
sense of the term, having strong, well-developed shoulders 
and withers, muscular quarters and ample bone. Size

is sought as being conducive to safety; the regulation 
fence is lower for a sixteen-hand horse than for one of only 
fifteen hands’ height; furthermore, in case the horse 
blunders, the momentum of his weight will allow him to 
break through the obstacle, whereas the lighter horse

would probably trip and come down. Then, other things 
being equal, the bigger horse is up to more weight, and 
many people who ride to hounds are following the sport 
to keep down avoirdupois. Hunters are classified on 
the basis of weight to which they are up, as light weight 
(Fig. 64), 135 to 165 pounds, middle weight, 165 pounds to
-P-A-G-E-160
140 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
  190 pounds, and heavy weight (Fig. 65), 190 pounds or 
over. They are also classified as qualified or green, de- 
pending upon whether or not they have hunted one season 
with a pack recognized by the United Hunts and Steeple 
Chase Association. 
  
  
      
Fig. 65.— A heavy weight hunter. 
161. The combination horse.— Nearly all saddle 
horses are broken to go in harness and many harness 
horses may be ridden, but in either case they do much 
better at the one performance or the other. There 
is, however, a horse of which equally satisfactory perform- 
ance is expected, whether under saddle or in harness, and
-P-A-G-E-161
    THE TYPES AND CLASSES 141 
he is therefore termed a ride-and-drive or combination 
horse. Although it is customary, for, convenience’ sake, 
to show combination horses in harness first, he is more typi- 
cally a saddle horse going well in harness than a harness 
horse that is capable of giving a good ride. The combina- 
tion horse is distinguished from the saddle horse proper 
by being of a somewhat more harnessy form with more 
speed at the trot. Under saddle he may go either three or 
five gaits, the former usually being shown in heavy harness 
and the latter in light harness. 
Classes for ‘ model” horses and for “ fine”? harness 
horses are in the catalogs of most southern shows. They 
both favor the Saddle-bred horse. 
162. The model horse. — These horses are judged on 
conformation and quality only, performance not being 
considered, and classes for them constitute a most effective 
means of promoting uniformity of type and individual 
excellence. 
163. The fine harness horses are, in a sense, model 
horses in harness, the ideal being a horse of extreme refine- 
ment and superior conformation, having neither speed nor 
great action but going, most attractively, a ten or twelve 
mile pace. 
Pony Drvision 
There is an increasing tendency, so far as the shows are 
concerned, to disregard any common pony type, but to 
differentiate between ponies on their conformity to either 
harness or saddle standards, the same as is done in horse 
classes. In a general way any equine under fourteen 
hands two inches is a pony, but it is not so at the shows. 
The classifications usually call for ponies under 46 inches, 
entries being usually, but not necessarily, of Shetland

breeding and type (Figs. 66 and 67) ; ponies eleven hands 
two inches and not exceeding fourteen hands two inches, 
this class being frequently subdivided at thirteen hands 
  
  
  Fria. 66.— A 42 inch harness pony. 
(Figs. 68 and 69); and polo ponies (Fig. 70). There 
are both harness and saddle classes for ponies of each 
of the first two specifications, and the same ponies may 
show, and even win, in both, but the line is being 
more sharply drawn between the harness and the saddle 
pony types. The heavy harness standard is adhered 
to in judging harness ponies, while in saddle classes 
both miniature walk-trot-canter and hunter types are 
considered.

ance incident to the game.

CHAPTER IX 
THE BREEDS OF HORSES 
Tur breeds of horses may be classified, according to the 
market classes, to the types of which their representations 
conform, as follows : 
Percheron. Hackney 
Belgian Heavy Harness { French Coach 
Draft { Clydesdale German Coach 
Shire 
Suffolk 
Light Harness — American Standardbred 
Thoroughbred 
Saddle { American Saddle Horse 
Shetland 
Pony { Welsh

167. The Percheron. — The typical Percheron (Fig. 71) 
is distinguished from the representatives of the other draft 
breeds by characters which can be attributed, primarily, 
to the hot blood in the breed’s foundation and to the fact 
that these horses were originally bred for rapid draft 
service. Percherons do not possess the scale and sub- 
stance of the Shire, the extremely drafty form of the 
Belgian, the broad, flat, straight hocks, sloping pasterns 
and accurate way of going of the Clydesdale, nor the usual 
good rib and the uniform coloring of the Suffolk. They

average of medium draft weight, stand over considerable 
ground for a draft horse, have a somewhat toppy general 
appearance, and a form that has been most appropriately 
described as of “a flowing, rounded contour indicative of

promptitude of movement as well as strength”! instead 
of square and blocky. They possess more general refine- 
ment, a better proportioned and more breedy head, and 
better texture of blue hoof than horses of any other draft 
breed. They also reflect their Oriental ancestry in an 
1 Johnstone’s ‘‘ The Horse Book.”
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE BREEDS OF HORSES 149 
active, somewhat nervous temperament and go with 
unusual snap and dash. Gray is the most typical color, 
though blacks have been most common, and bays, browns 
and chestnuts occur but are not favored. 
In brief the Percheron is a rapid draft horse of a cold and 
hot blood origin which has had his weight brought up to

modern draft requirements by his breeders resorting to 
stronger infusions of cold blood, but selecting to retain the 
activity and refinement of the original to as great an ex- 
tent as the law of correlation would permit of. 
168. The Belgian. — The Belgian (Fig. 72) is the most 
uniformly low down and wide out of any of the draft breeds
-P-A-G-E-170
  150 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
and is surpassed in weight only by the Shire. He is ex- 
tremely compactly put together with square, massive ends 
and a short, wide and deep middle, characters with which 
there are too frequently correlated a short, thick, heavy- 
crested neck and short, straight, stubby pasterns. The 
head is of medium length, broad and deep and strong in

the jowl, eyes not sufficiently large or prominent and 
ears set too low sometimes. His short legs are heavily 
muscled in the forearm and the gaskin, although the bone 
is often not of the best quality nor the feet as large and 
round as the size of the horse requires. Belgians, while 
essentially cold in their make-up are good movers, es- 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE BREEDS OF HORSES 151 
pecially at the trot. Roan, chestnut, bay and brown are 
the prevailing colors, although black and gray occur. 
169. The Clydesdale.—The Clydesdale (Fig. 78) is 
distinguished by a mechanical perfection in locomotory 
apparatus which is not generally equaled by representa- 
  
    
    
Fie. 74. — A Shire stallion. 
tives of other draft breeds. The set of the legs, the 
slope of the pasterns, the quality of the bone, combined, 
as it is, with ample substance, and the straight, free, 
springy, yet powerful stride are most characteristic of this 
breed. However, such a stride is impossible in a horse of
-P-A-G-E-172
  152 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
extreme draft form, consequently the typical Clydesdale 
is a more upstanding and correspondingly longer, narrower 
and shallower bodied individual than the representatives 
of the other draft breeds. This is comparatively speaking, 
however, as the Clydesdale is in every respect a draft horse, 
and his stamp has some things to commend it over the 
other extreme, which is the only type recognized by some 
draft horse judges. The Clydesdale has length of neck and 
slope of shoulders which fit a collar admirably, and which 
with their long, level croup constitute two ends of a very 
good top line, provided the back is not too low, as is some- 
times the case. Clydesdale colors are bay and brown most 
commonly with a profusion of white markings; black 
and gray are not rare. 
170. The Shire (Fig. 74).— Bulk and bone are the two 
features which characterize the Shire most. They are the 
result of selection to the Englishman’s ideal of a draft horse, 
backed up by an environment in Lincolnshire and Cam- 
bridgeshire, England, where they were bred, which is most 
conducive to just such a structure as the breeders strive 
to attain. His great scale and substance, with his form, 
are most impressive of draftiness. Yet with all there is a 
grossness that is suggestive of a low grade of material in 
his construction. The head is large, especially long, with 
the face line inclined to be Roman, and the counte- 
nance expressing a sluggish temperament. The hair coat 
is luxuriant, the mane and tail being especially heavy 
and feather abundant with oftentimes vestiges of the 
mustache and tufts at knees and the points of the hocks 
by which the old Flanders horse was characterized. 
There is a wide range of colors in the Shire, bay, brown, 
and black being most common, gray and chestnut not 
unusual and roans occasional, all considerably marked
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE BREEDS OF HORSES 153 
with white. The way of going of a Shire is that of a great 
horse. He moves slowly, almost ponderously, with a 
ack of freedom in his stride, but there is power in the 
movement. Straight shoulders and pasterns, flat, shelly 
  
      
Fig. 75.— A Suffolk stallion. 
feet, a sluggish temperament, and a stilty stride are 
features which Shire breeders seek to improve. 
171. The Suffolk.— Having been developed chiefly
-P-A-G-E-174
  154 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
within the confines of one county, descending exclusively 
from an individual foundation sire, and having been bred 
primarily for agricultural purposes, this breed is of excep- 
tionally uniform type (Fig. 75). The most striking features ° 
are the invariable chestnut color and the “punch” form, 
2.e. a low set, full, round, compact, massive body. They 
have fairly fine, intelligent heads, rather full crested necks, 
corresponding to their ample bodies, and clean legs, devoid 
of feather. All shades of chestnut are ‘encountered ; 
flaxen manes and tails are not unusual but white markings 
are. 
Suffolks, while they never have been regarded as a heavy 
draft breed, are quite frequently not up to draft weight. 
The punch bodies and clean legs are sometimes overdone, 
giving the effect of too fine bone under a large superstruc- 
ture. 
172. The Hackney.— The antecedents of modern 
Hackneys were a race of stoutly made trotters possessed 
of the stamina requisite to the performance of seventeen 
miles per hour, and they were up to any weight. They 
represented a Thoroughbred top cross on a common 
base, the trotting proclivities, in this instance, being 
alleged to come from the Friesland trotter blood in the 
dams. This stock was later made the basis of selection 
to harness requirements, and so faithfully were selec- 
tions made and requirements met that the Hackney is 
to-day the heavy harness horse par excellence. The typical 
representative (Fig. 76) was formerly a low set horse, very 
close and full made, and therefore weighing more than his 
height would indicate. Greater favor is now expressed 
for a more upstanding, finer individual. However, 
Hackneys rarely exceed 15-3 in height. The form is 
harnessy in the extreme, being especially rotund, the head 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
THE BREEDS OF HORSES 155 
well proportioned, with a straight face line, a deep jowl, a 
neck of fair length and well crested, an especially round 
rib, smooth level croup, full muscular quarters and ample 
bone. Chestnut color with white markings all around is 
the rule, although bays and browns are common. The 
  
  
    Fic. 76.— A Hackney stallion. 
way of going of the Hackney is characteristic. He is 
naturally disposed to be proud and stylish and goes with a 
degree of action that is unexcelled, hocks especially being 
sharply flexed. 
There being no discrimination in the studbook between 
full-sized Hackneys and ponies, the line between them is 
not sharply drawn. Mares of some size are mated with 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
156 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
pony stallions and vice versa, with the results that there 
are many undersized individuals, over the pony limit, yet 
too small to be acceptable as horses. The naturally full, 
well-crested neck shows a tendency to be too strong in 
some cases, the thick throttle compressing the larynx 
  
      
  Fie. 77.— A French Coach stallion. 
when flexed, as it is when the horse is driven. Hackneys 
are essentially high steppers and some do not go on in 
their stride but tramp too much in the same place. 
Stamina, also, has not been sought nor required in the 
performance for which the Hackney is best qualified.
-P-A-G-E-177
    ‘THE BREEDS OF HORSES 157 
They should not, however, appear soft. Height of stride 
increases concussion, but that is not sufficient excuse 
for some Hackneys pounding as they do, nor should their 
action be labored, but airy. 
173. The French Coach (Fig. 77). — Demi-sang or half 
blooded to begin with and having been bred for cavalry 
service primarily, the French Coach horse is not as readily 
distinguishable as the other heavy harness breeds in which 
the type is more uniform. The most approved individuals 
of this breed are about sixteen hands high, and weigh 
from 1200 to 1400 pounds; are rather upstanding, suffi- 
ciently close and full made to be of true harness form, yet 
manifesting no suggestion of draftiness. They should 
reflect. their proximate Thoroughbred ancestry by their 
refined heads and necks and the texture of bone and hoof 
in their legs and feet. Hard, solid colors prevail, although 
one or two white points, though rarely more, are common. 
They move with a creditable show of both pace and action. 
In addition to the rather general lack of uniformity of 
type there are many individuals of this breed that display 
too much of the cold character of their original maternal 
ancestry. Others, which give much promise standing 
still, are most indifferent actors, and even among those 
which go well there is a tendency to do it all in front, failing 
to follow with a balanced action of hocks. 
174. The German Coach (Fig.78). — Tap rooted in the 
region to which the Flemish horse was indigenous and bred 
primarily for the mounting of the heavy, fully equipped 
German trooper, size and substance predominate in this 
breed. They stand full sixteen hands or more and some 
weigh fifteen hundred pounds, being the largest of the heavy 
harness breeds. Size and substance, without the introduc- 
tion of any draft character, and hard, solid colors, more 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  158 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
uniformly than in any other breed, are the characters by 
which German Coachers are distinguished from represent- 
atives of the other heavy harness breeds. 
There is a marked tendency for them to be gross and 
lymphatic. A drafty form, coarse head and neck, rough

joints, a sluggish disposition and inability to step either 
high or reasonably fast are features which judges of this 
breed of horses should discriminate against. 
175. The Standardbred. — Created at the instance of
-P-A-G-E-179
THE BREEDS OF HORSES 159 
the American road driver who first sought harness speed, 
bred from a composite foundation, in which the Thorough- 
bred top cross figured most conspicuously, the base con- 
sisting of common bred mares which had shown an aptitude 
to trot, due, perhaps, to the blood of the Dutch trotter, 
this horse has been bred to a standard of speed perform- 
  
      
  Fic. 79.— A Standardbred stallion. 
ance. As a result, the type is not uniform, although the 
extreme speed performance has been attained in a wonder- 
ful degree and with extraordinary regularity. Standard- 
breds (Fig. 79) range in height from pony stature to sixteen 
hands and in weight from 800 to 1200 pounds or over, the 
most approved size being about 15-3 and 1100 pounds. 
They conform to the general speed type, modified in those 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  160 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
special features which distinguish trotter and pacer from 
runner and jumper, 7.e. a lower forehand, a longer, more 
sloping croup, greater relative length from elbow to knee, 
and from hip to hock, resulting in the hocks being set 
farther back, and necessitating a more abrupt deviation 
of the hind legs downward and forward to the ground. 
The head of the Standardbred is of good size, not espe- 
cially fine, but clean cut, the neck of medium length, lean 
and straight. The way of going is most characteristic. 
Whether at trot or pace the gait is distinguished by 
the length and rapidity of the individual strides, and the 
level, true, frictionless manner in which they are executed. 
Furthermore, the instinct to trot is well marked. Colors 
are not at all uniform although bays predominate. 
Undersized and ill shaped individuals with ewe necks, 
goose rumps, bent or rounded hocks and tied-in cannons 
are too common. 
176. The Thoroughbred. — As indicated by the name, 
this is the purest breed of horses, except the Oriental, from 
which they are derived. They were the first to be im- 
proved and the first for which pedigree records were kept 
and a stud-book established., They also have been bred 
for about two and one half centuries with running speed 
as the sole consideration. The typical Thoroughbred is 
characterized, therefore, by the strongest evidence of breed- 
ing and refinement, together with a racy form and tem- 
perament. The most representative individuals (Fig. 80) 
stand near sixteen hands, and weigh 1000 to 1100 pounds. 
They are rangy, with that length of legs, body and neck 
which is conducive to a long stride. They conform 
strictly to the speed form, in fact, are the truest exponents 
of the speed type, distinguished from the trotter and pacer 
by greater range, better development of the forehand, more

level croup, thicker thighs, less proportionate length from 
hip to hock, and therefore a straighter hind leg, longer, more 
sloping pasterns, a smaller foot of finer texture, finer bone, 
and a predisposition to stand over at the knee. The head 
is the smallest and best proportioned, with features and

which it carries well forward rather than up; the shoulder 
longest and most sloping, the withers highest, leanest 
and most extended. Bay, chestnut and brown with white 
markings are the most common colors, although black, 
gray and white were formerly not infrequent and are yet 
sometimes seen. The way of going of the Thoroughbred 
M
-P-A-G-E-182

is very characteristic ; being essentially a galloper, his walk 
and trot are not as good as that gait at which he excels. 
He walks indifferently and trots with a low, pointing stride 
in front and a dragging of hocks. At the gallop, how- 
ever, it seems as though his whole makeup were designed 
with that end in view, each part acting codrdinately with 
the others to make a perfect gallop. 
The ranginess of the speed form is sometimes overdone in 
the Thoroughbred, rendering him weedy (too long-legged 
and light-bodied). There is also a tendency, in some in- 
dividuals, to be too fine in bone and too small, especially 
when measured up to the present standard. Quite 
commonly they are too “hot” in temperament and 
erratic in disposition. 
Judges of Thoroughbreds usually distinguish between 
the race horse and the hunter and saddle horse, especially 
when they are concerned as sires. 
177. The American Saddle Horse. — This is a Thorough- 
bred derivative, rendered especially adaptable to the pur- 
pose for which bred by the ambling instinct contributed by 
the ‘native ” mares with which the foundation Thorough- 
breds were mated. Since their foundation, Saddle horses 
have been selected to a model, as well as a performance, 
standard. They may be distinguished by the following 
characters (Fig. 81) ; an upstanding horse of most symmet- 
rical and beautifully molded form, a well-proportioned, 
blood-like head, the features of which are most clearly de- 
fined, an intelligent countenance, and an exceptionally 
long, shapely and supple neck, on which the head is set 
in a lofty, graceful manner. The two ends are the most 
characteristic parts of the Saddle-bred horse, the long, level 
croup and unusually high set and proudly carried tail 
balancing the lofty carriage of head, in compliance with

representatives of this breed. The trot is quite frequently 
marked by more action than is usually required of saddle 
horses, and is, in fact, well suited to harness performance. 
The highest class Saddle-bred horse is a show horse in every 
sense of the word, whether under saddle or in harness.

So much has been made of the two ends of the Saddle 
horse that they are sometimes deficient in the middle, 
being both low in the back and short in the rib, while the 
quality by which they are characterized may be had at 
such a sacrifice of substance as to render them too fine.

child’s pony idea is claimed to have originated in this 
country. For these reasons it is not difficult to account 
for the variance in type from the British and the American

points of view. The old country type is naturally a pony 
of power,—a draft horse in miniature—while the 
American demand is for a pony of less blocky form, with a 
finer head and neck, a better shape, especially in forehand 
and hindquarters, and more step. The natural stride is 
short and pointing, any great display of action usually 
being due to weighting, which is often excessive. Shetland 
color is most typically a cinnamon brown or black, al- 
though piebalds, skewbalds, bays, chestnuts and even 
odd colors, as dun and mouse color, are encountered. 
Breeders generally prefer the hard, solid colors, while the 
broken colors are most popular with the buyers of ponies 
for children’s use. 
Coarse heads, thick necks, round, pudgy middles, steep 
croups, light thighs and crooked legs are too common. 
This pony’s greatest asset is his docility ; therefore any 
manifestation of ill temper should be seriously discriminated 
against. 
179. The Welsh. — Derived from a hardy race of ponies 
native to the Welsh mountains, this breed has been im- 
proved in shape and way of going, partly by means of 
Hackney crosses, till they are very typical heavy harness 
horses in miniature (Fig. 83). They range in height from 
the Shetland limit of 11 hands 2 inches to the pony limit 
of 14 hands 2 inches. 
The foreign Welsh Pony and Cob Stud-book extends 
its classification to include, as cobs, horses of Welsh 
breeding which stand as high as 15 hands 2° inches. 
The classification follows : 
A. Ponies not exceeding 12 hands 2 inches. 
B. Ponies 12 hands 2 inches to 13 hands 2 inches. 
C. Ponies 13 hands 2 inches to 14 hands 2 inches. 
D. Ponies 14 hands 2 inches to 15 hands 2 inches.

of little horses than as children’s playmates, like the 
Shetlands. Some go high and others can step quite fast, 
while all have extraordinary stamina. Bay and brown

  CHAPTER X 
THE MULE 
Tue mule is the equine hybrid between the male ass, 
Equus assinus, and the mare, Equus caballus. Although 
“with no pride of ancestry, no hope of posterity,” as the 
Missourian has well said, and therefore eliminated from 
the scope of this work in so far as selection in breeding is 
concerned, there is ample justification, if little precedent, 
for including the mule in this discussion. 
He rules supreme in the field of the work horse in the 
South, while in some other agricultural districts he is 
depended upon for the farm work, and his use in the cities 
is considerable. It is important for those who use mules, 
as well as those who purchase them, to know what mule 
excellence consists of. 
Mules have been variously classed, in accordance with 
the nature of the work to which they are put, but there 
are essentially. but two types, draft and plantation. 
181. The draft mule.— These mules are used for 
power service chiefly outside the cities or at least off the 
city streets. Mules pull more by their muscular strength 
and steady, persistent effort than by virtue of their weight, 
and are especially handy and sure footed in rough and try- 
ing places. They “ push” rather than “ lift ”’ their load. 
For this reason, as well! as on account of the small circum- 
ference of their feet and comparatively less weight, they 
are not as satisfactory on paved city streets as horses.

The draft mule (Fig. 85) weighs 1200 to 1250 pounds and 
stands fifteen hands three inches to seventeen hands, a 
mule being taller in proportion to his weight than a horse.

eighteen hands two inches. This mule conforms to the 
draft horse type in being low set, broad, deep, compact, 
massive and big-boned, with quality manifested particu- 
larly in smoothness and a straight, strong way of going. 
Mules of the draft type are classified as drafters and 
miners. 
Drafter is the largest representative of this type, best 
1Bulletin No. 122, Illinois Experiment Station.
-P-A-G-E-190
  170 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
adapted to heavy work, as on the streets of Southern 
cities, city contractors’ operations, railroad grades, and 
in lumber camps. 
Miner is characterized by being more blocky and rugged 
with most power in least stature. They range in height 
from the twelve hand pitter for working in low chambers 
to the sixteen hand mule for work at the surface. Their 
weights vary, accordingly, from 600 to 1300 pounds. 
182. The plantation mule.— The requirements of the 
plantation mule are to walk fast, endure the hard work of

  THE MULE 171 
the soft ground through the heat of the day and be sure- 
footed, so as not to tramp plants in cultivating. The mule 
for this service is more rangy and snappy than the draft 
mule, characters derived from more hot blood in the dams 
and therefore associated with less size and substance in the 
mules. Representatives of this type (Fig. 86) weigh from 
950 to 1200 pounds and stand fourteen hands two inches to 
sixteen hands two inches. They are built more on the 
rapid draft order, conforming somewhat to the shape of 
an express horse, and should have especially good legs 
and feet, a high degree of refinement, an active, nervous 
temperament and be straight, free, snappy movers. 
Mules of the plantation type are classified as sugar, 
cotton and farm. 
The sugar mule is for the use of the Southern planter. 
He is the best representative of this type, rangy, smooth, 
with great quality and breediness, yet ample bone. 
The cotton mule is a smaller, somewhat plainer planta- 
tion mule of the same general type as the sugar mule. 
The farm mule class comprises the poorer grades of the 
other two classes, or thin mules that might feed into either 
of the other classes which are purchased by the farm 
trade. 
Mare mules are usually preferred as being smoother, 
better shaped and easier keepers. Seal brown is the color 
most desired, then bay, chestnut and gray.

  CHAPTER XI 
THE TYPES 
183. The block group. — Preliminary to the considera- 
tion of beef cattle, those features characteristic of all the 
block group, namely, beef cattle, mutton sheep and fat 
hogs, in common, may be disposed of. 
All vertebrates are possessed of a muscular system 
mounted upon a skeleton foundation which serves the 
purpose of locomotion or any other motion of which the 
animal is capable. Under feral conditions animals resort 
to movements of various kinds for their sustenance and 
their protection. The husbandman has in this instance, 
as in many others, perverted a natural function into other 
lines more useful to him, and this muscular system which 
was furnished the animal as a means of moving, living 
and having its being becomes the source of one of man’s 
most concentrated, nutritious and digestible foods. 
184. Meat, although it may mean any food, is gen- 
erally understood to be a portion of the animal’s body 
composed chiefly of muscle, the connective tissue by which 
it is supported, the fatty tissue by which it is enveloped 
and interspersed, and the section of the skeleton upon 
which it is mounted. The animal from which the meat is 
secured gives to it its specific nature, as beef, mutton, or 
pork. Meat, however, is a carcass term and is not ap- 
plied to the tissue mentioned in the living animal. The 
synonymous term, having reference to the animal rather 
175
-P-A-G-E-196
  176 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
than to the carcass, is flesh. Yet there should be dis- 
crimination’ in the use of this term. To speak of eating 
the flesh of animals implies a meaning identical with meat, 
but reference to the natural flesh or the thick flesh, of 
feeder steers, for instance, includes the muscle only, with- 
out the fat, and therein lies the distinction. Whereas the 
muscle that is most efficient for movement is of such firm 
texture and so devoid of any fat as to render it tough, the 
chief feature of the muscle which constitutes the desirable 
lean of meat is just the reverse. 
The function of meat-producing animals is the conver- 
sion of common foodstuffs, in a form not available to man, 
into a concentrated, palatable, easily digested form of 
protein and fat. 
The profit returned by them is divided between the 
breeder who produces them, the feeder who finishes 
them, the butcher or packer who dresses and wholesales 
their carcasses, and the retailer who purveys them to 
the consumers, their ultimate end. It is rare, except in 
the case of production for limited farm or home use, that 
one and the same individual is concerned with each step. 
185. The breeder’s, the feeder’s and the butcher’s inter- 
ests in the meat animal. — Success, on the breeder’s part, 
consists in producing an animal that is a satisfactory 
butcher prospect acceptable to the feeder. The feeder’s 
business is to secure, in the shortest feeding period and 
with the most economic and productiye use of food, the 
most highly finished and satisfactory butcher beast. 
The butcher’s proposition is to obtain, in the dressed 
animal, as high a percentage of his gross live weight as 
possible and to have the maximum amount of the dressed 
weight carried in those parts of the carcass for which there 
is greatest demand and the highest price paid. The re-
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE TYPES ate 
tailer, finally, buys ribs and loins of such quality of meat as 
will secure for him the most generous patronage of those 
consumers who appreciate and pay for the best meats. 
Type is therefore the primary consideration of the 
breeder ; early maturity, feeding and rapid fattening capac- 
ity, of the feeder ; dressing percentage and distribution of 
the weight in the carcass, of the butcher ; and quality, of the 
man who cuts the carcass on the block. 
Economy in production is a matter of type, early ma- 
turity, rapid fattening and dressing percentage. Quality 
of the product depends upon the breeding, feeding, age 
and dressing of the animal and the cutting of the carcass, 
and consists of texture, color, consistence, distribution 
and proportion of the fat and lean and the percentage of 
meat to bone. 
186. The block type. — Prime carcasses of meat are 
produced by immature, unsexed animals, more commonly 
males, of the block type fed to their optimum degree 
of ripeness. The block type is characterized by a blocky 
or rectangular form set on short legs and furnished with 
thick flesh (Fig. 87). 
187. Early maturity.— There is a marked difference 
in the extent to which individuals will develop in the 
same period of time. Interest on investment, labor and 
feed must all be charged against gross receipts to de- 
termine the net profit returned by any block animal, 
and these three important profit factors are all reduced 
in the case of the early maturing animal. 
188. Rapid fattening is usually correlated with early 
maturity but should be distinguished from it. One 
animal matures rapidly, fattening readily at the same time ; 
another may mature slowly, then fatten quickly, after 
once mature; still another may reach maturity promptly, 
N 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
    178 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
but never develop any capacity to fatten. Rapid fatten- 
ing, like early maturity, means prompt returns and gener- 
ous margins. 
189. Dressing percentage expresses that proportion of 
he live animal which is hung up after being killed and

Champion carcass. 
dressed. The difference between the live weight and the 
dressed weight represents the offal and a slight shrinkage 
in chilling. 
190. Quality in meat.—So far as the consumer is 
concerned quality consists of such a fine, delicate texture 
of the meat as will insure easy mastication, toughness 
being most suggestive of low quality to the majority of
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE TYPES 179 
meat eaters; also such flavor as will make the meat most 
palatable, this being of secondary importance to texture 
as a rule, because flavor may be altered to such an extent 
in the cooking process. The relative nutritive values 
of meat figure less in the consumer’s demand and are, 
therefore, of less concern to the judge. Both texture 
and flavor are contributed to or indicated by the grain of 
the lean, the proportion of fat to lean, the distribution of 
the fat, the color and consistence of both lean and fat 
and the moisture and odor of the meat. 
191. The grain of the meat involves especially the part 
of the carcass from which the cut is taken, improving 
toward the center of the carcass away from the extremi- 
ties, the coarser cuts being taken from the neck, shoulders, 
shanks, the small part of the leg 
and the rump, the loin and rib 
cuts being finest grained. Old 
animals, as a rule, have coarser- 
grained muscle tissue with more 
connective tissue in it than do 
younger ones. 
192. Marbling. — A generous 
proportion of fat to lean is de- 
sirable, since it is impossible to 
secure, age, or prepare prime 
meat without fat. The better 
class of meat animals are all fed 
to a high finish. Unless there is 
a fairly thick layer of fat sur- Fic. 88.—The fat cells in-

-P-A-G-E-200
  180 LIVE+STOCK JUDGING 
As a matter of fact, the so-called juices are not altogether 
blood and cell protoplasm, but fat. A lean piece of meat 
will be dry when served. In order to impart, as well as 
‘preserve, juiciness in the meat the fat should be dis- 
tributed though the lean as well as accumulated on the 
surface of the cuts. Interspersed within and about the 
bundles of individual muscle fibers (Fig. 88), it constitutes 
the marbling that is most noticeable in the rib (Fig. 89) 
and loin cuts of beef, which in addition to furnishing 
  Fig. 89.— The ‘ marbling” of meat. 
juice improves the cooking quality of the meat by con- 
ducting the heat of the fire uniformly throughout the 
mass. 
193. Color and consistence of fat and lean. — It has 
been demonstrated that the fat that is most disposed 
to thus distribute itself instead of accummulating either 
externally or internally is of a white, not yellow, color, 
and of a crisp, brittle, not greasy, consistency. Also that 
the lean most likely to be well marbled is of a clear, deep, 
red color when cut, neither light red nor bluish, and it has 
a firm, elastic consistency, neither flabby nor doughy.
-P-A-G-E-201
THE TYPES 181 
194. Moisture. — Prime meat should just moisten the 
finger when touched, and should not be slimy. Either 
immaturity or old age may be responsible for a slimy con- 
dition, as may also emaciation from any cause. 
195. Odor. — Properly dressed meat in a good state 
of preservation has scarcely any odor. 
196. Taste not only depends upon the prime nature 
of the meat and the manner of preparing and serving it, 
but upon the care exercised in dressing. A sheep butcher, 
for instance, will use the utmost care in turning back the 
pelt so that the wool may not touch the carcass and give 
it a woolly taste. 
197. Proportion of lean to bone.—The amount of the 
bone in proportion to the weight of the carcass con- 
cerns the consumer most of all, bone being waste to 
him, and on this account rough, coarse-boned steers, hogs 
and sheep are discriminated against all along the line. 
Refinement of bone is a feature of the general refinement 
which results from improved breeding and is correlated 
with quality of the carcass in general and little waste. 
198. Influence of breeding. — Feed is prerequisite to 
fat, but the amount, distribution, color and consistence 
of the fat as well as the color and consistence of the 
lean and the shape of the carcass are matters of breeding. 
For instance, representatives of leading beef and dairy 
breeds have been fed the same rations under identical con- 
ditions for equal periods with extremely different results 
between the individuals of the beef and dairy groups.! 
This test carried through to the actual cutting of the car- 
casses demonstrated what has usually been found to be the 
rule, 7.e. that the beef-bred animal increases his weight 
by the formation of fat, while the dairy-bred steer grows 
1 Iowa Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 81.
-P-A-G-E-202
    182 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
an excess of bone; that the former deposits his fat in, as 
well as upon, the lean, thus enhancing the actual value of 
the carcass as well as increasing the dressing percentage, 
while the latter accumulates an excess of fat about the 
viscera, organs which, with the exception of the kidney, 
are removed in dressing, the carcass showing no marbling 
whatever; that the fat of the beef carcass is of the sort 
described above, while that of the dairy animal is high 
colored and buttery, the lean of the former fine grained 
and of good color, while that of the latter is cross grained 
and dark colored. 
Cattle (Bos taurus) are the largest of the domesticated 
ruminants. They were early domesticated and haveserved 
the triple purpose of work, milk and meat in the order 
named. They are especially adapted to the consumption 
of large amounts of roughage and are thus conservators of 
much that would otherwise be wasted. 
The types of cattle are beef, dairy and dual purpose. 
Brrr Catrie 
The unsexed male or female, of immature age and in 
prime condition yields the most desirable carcass of 
beef, — bulls, stags and old females, especially worn-out: 
dairy cows, being utilized chiefly as cured beef or cut up 
for the lower class trade. 
199. Production. — Since the best beef animal is the 
one which hangs up the most superior carcass, the slaughter 
test must be kept in view by the beef cattle judge, and 
the most exacting demands of the consumer patron of the 
retail butcher should be given due consideration. It 
seems reasonable that the judge of beef cattle should be 
a connoisseur of sirloin. Since quality of beef is one
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE TYPES ; 183 
of the ends sought in the fat steer it is well for the judge 
to know just what that quality consists of (paragraph 190). 
The beef steer is, however, required to do more than to 
satisfy the demands of the beef-eating public; he must 
return a profit to his butcher, his feeder and his breeder. 
The factors of quality already considered determine 
whether or not the carcass will grade as prime and bring 
the highest price, but there are other factors which fix 
the other limit of the butcher’s margin of profit that are 
of equal importance. The butcher pays 8 cents a pound 
for the live steer which weighs 1200 pounds on foot. 
He immediately subjects the steer to slaughter and dressing 
which converts him into two sides of beef and the dressing 
offal, consisting of hide, head, shins and feet, blood, chest 
and abdominal viscera and their contents. This, with 
the shrinkage incident to the loss of moisture in chilling, 
may amount to from 50 % to 25 % of the live weight of 
the steer originally purchased. While with modern packing 
methods every particle of the offal has some value, the 
aggregate will not amount to as much as its original pur- 
chase price. Furthermore, there are many pounds of 
the dressed carcass that must be sold at from 25 % to 
50 % less than they cost. Therefore the burden of 
responsibility for the profit to be yielded by the carcass 
must rest upon those parts for which a price much in 
excess of cost can be secured. Quality being equal, the 
steer that will hang, in dressed sides, the greatest amount 
of his live weight and that carries the major part of his 
dressed weight in those regions of the carcass which com- 
mand the best price, is most profitable. 
200. The beef carcass cuts. — The division of the car- 
cass as it is cut up by the butcher should be anticipated 
by the judge. These divisions are indicated by the follow-

After being bled out, the head, hide, extremities and 
viscera removed, the carcass is split into halves. When 
chilled until set, each side, herefter a unit in the trade, 
losing all idenity with its fellow, is cut into fore and hind

quality of meat is on the inside or the top of the round 
as it lies on the block. 
The forequarter is cut into the prime ribs, chuck, 
neck and plate. 
203. The ribs. — The prime ribs (Fig. 94) include the 
seven ribs counting forward from the loin end of the fore- 
quarter, which brings the division of the rib and chuck 
between the fifth 
and sixth rib. The 
distance down on 
the rib at which 
the limit between 
prime ribs and plate 
is fixed depends § 
upon the thickness 
of flesh on the rib 
and the size of the 
carcass. Since rib 
cuts are high priced 
and plate cuts are low, the butcher will usually keep as 
much weight in the ribs as their covering will permit of. 
Carcasses of steers that were bare on the rib will cut 
proportionately more plate than those from steers that 
were thickly fleshed on the rib. The division is usually 
made ten to thirteen inches from the back bone. 
204. The chuck includes the balance of the ribs and the 
shoulder blade, limited below by continuing through the 
shoulder joint the cut that divides the prime ribs from the 
plate. The cross cut ribs and the clod are taken from the 
chuck at the arm, the remainder of the leg being the shank. 
The fore part of the plate may be separately designated

206. Relative values of the carcass cuts. — Since the beef 
steer is a straight business proposition, the most impor- 
tant thing for the judge to know regarding the carcass cuts  
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE TYPES 189 
is their relative values. They rank as follows: the high- 
est priced cut of the carcass is the loin; the rib cut is 
valued at from 10 to 20 % less, per pound, than the loin 
of the same grade; the round at 40 to 50 % less than the 
rib; the rump is worth a little less than the round; the 
best grade of chucks sell at about the same price as the 
rounds; while the plate, the flank, the shank and the neck 
  
    
Fra. 95.— A typical beef steer. 
sell for less, per pound, than the live weight cost of the 
steer. Steers dress 50 % to 70 % of their live weight. 
207. Dressing percentage. — The dressing percentage of 
the steer involves type, quality and condition, while the 
relative weights and values of the different parts of the 
carcass are determined by type and conformation. 
208. Type is fundamental even to conformation in 
that it is impossible to have a broad, thick loin on a steer
-P-A-G-E-210
   
    190 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
of any but beef type. The type of steer that favors 
greatest weight in the carcass, least waste and the greatest 
proportion of weight in the most valuable cuts is that which 
conforms to a block or rectangle, being low set on short 
legs, with top and under lines parallel, the square bris- 
ket and hindquarters outlining a parallelogram in profile, 
while the broad, flat back and loin and wide ends complete 
the rectangle (Fig. 95). 
209. Conformation of the beef steer.— The head of 
the beef steer serves as an index to the rest of his make-up 
and should therefore be the opposite of that of the dairy 
cow, 7.e. short, broad and deep, with a more placid, even 
lazy expression of countenance; the eyes large, full and 
clear; the muzzle broad, the nostrils large; the ears of 
medium size, set high and carried alert; the horns sym- 
metrical but not coarse, or a sharp, well-defined pole; the 
neck as short as possible, thick, yet not heavy in the 
throat, especially full in that region where the neck 
blends with the shoulder, termed the shoulder vein; the 
shoulders well laid in, thickly covered, the side of the 
shoulder being one place that is especially liable to be 
bare, broad across the top, without being rough or open 
but so well covered as to be compact and smooth at 
this point ; chine broad and level with a thick covering of 
mellow flesh, also straight, showing no sag toward its 
juncture with the loin; ribs well sprung, deep and thickly 
covered, especially on the fore rib, that region designated 
as the crops, a round, deep rib also contributing to the 
heart girth and abdominal capacity; chest deep, full, 
level on the floor and square at the brisket; loin broad, 
thick, smooth, no rolls, level, with no sag or tie where it joins 
the back; flank deep and full, making a straight under 
line; hips broad, level, smooth and not prominent;  
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE TYPES 191 
rump long, broad, level and smooth, showing no coarseness 
of bone about the tail head and no unevenness of covering, 
in the nature of patches, about the tail head or pin bones ; 
thighs broad, thick, and deep, well rounded in appearance 
from any angle and especially full and low in the region of 
the inner, lower thigh, known as the twist on account of 
the rotation of those muscles which takes place when the 
carcass is hung up by the hamstring, the juncture of the 
two thighs being referred to as the seam of the twist; 
the legs short, straight, strong and fine boned. 
210. Quality in the steer influences the dressing per- 
centage by controlling the amount of waste or offal. It 
also makes a higher grade carcass, quality of hide and 
hair, for instance, being correlated with quality of lean 
and fat. Quality is of hide and hair, indicated in a 
loose, medium thin, pliable, unctucus hide covered with a 
medium coat of fine, soft, straight hair and determined 
by handling; of bone, as evidenced in a comparatively 
small, fine head and horn, smooth shoulders, hooks and 
pins, small cannons, and clearly defined joints; of flesh, 
as shown by an even, smooth covering over the back, 
loin and rib with no rolls or patches of fat and neither too 
soft nor too hard a feel. Quality is also concerned with 
general trimness and refinement of the animal throughout, 
indicative of breeding. 
211. Condition has most to do with the weight that is 
left in the carcass after dressing away the offal. Of 
course, internal fat increases the amount of waste, but 
every pound of fat fed into the carcass itself increases the 
dressed weight and therefore the percentage of live 
weight, that much. Show animals regularly dress more 
than ordinary market: toppers, chiefly because they are 
fatter. Condition is ripeness and until the steer has

reached this state he has not attained maximum produc- 
tion. Condition or ripeness is indicated by a full purse, 
flank and tongue root, these being the last places at which 
fat accumulates in the ripening process. 
212. Feeder cattle.—The butcher deals with an 
actuality, the feeder with a prospect, but in order to be 
successful in his operations the feeder must keep the 
butcher requirements constantly in view (Fig. 96). The 
feeder’s profits depend, first of all, upon the production 
of an acceptable butcher’s beast, but secondarily upon the 
economy with which this can be accomplished. There is 
a vast difference in the relative efficiency of individual 
steers so far as economy in production is concerned. Not 
all show steers are popular with the packers, but even 
some which are market toppers are money losers when 
the cost of production is charged against even the premium 
price which they bring. 
213. Feed lot production. — So far as becoming a bul- 
lock acceptable to the butcher goes, the feeder steer is 
the butcher steer minus condition, but in economic pro- 
duction the feeder introduces a feature that is of no account 
to the butcher, namely, constitution. Profit in the feed 
lot requires that the cattle shall be good “ doers,” disposed 
to consume a full ration, regularly, with no skips or misses 
due to off-feed periods, and then capable of making full 
return in gains for each pound of feed consumed (Fig. 97). 
In addition, therefore, to being bred right feeders must 
show evidence of thrift, vigor and growth, with early 
maturity and capacity to fatten rapidly, yet evenly. Just 
what the fattening process consists of, as well as what it 
accomplishes, is also of vital concern to the judge of feeder 
cattle. It should be understood that the gains in weight 
shown by cattle on feed represent either an increase in the

lie down and grunt and grow are the features upon which 
the selection of feeders is based. It is essential to know the 
fat steer which is the feeder’s outcome before passing judg- 
ment upon the thin prospect. 
215. Method of inspection. — Beef cattle are first 
viewed from in front, noting their scale, width and low 
station, then the size, dimensions, proportions, contour 
and features of the head. Passing to the side the lines 
are observed, noting especially any sag in the back, droop 
of the rump or prominence at the tail head, lack of fullness 
in either crops or fore flank, trimness of under line, and 
depth of hind flank; then the head in profile, the shortness 
of the neck, fullness of the shoulder vein, thickness and 
character of the covering over the back and loin, on the 
outside of the shoulder, in the crops, on the mid rib, and 
at the juncture of the back and the loin, as determined by 
handling, and the length, levelness and smoothness of the 
rump, setting on of the tail and depth and fullness of the 
hindquarters. From the side the hide is handled just over 
the back rib and midway down. The rear view covers 
the width of the animal throughout and especially of the 
shoulders, back, loin, rump, thighs and twist, and the 
fullness, depth and closeness in the seam of the latter. 
The opposite side is observed in the same order as the 
first. The legs of a fat steer, ready for the slaughter, are 
of little account.

Darry Carrie 
The primitive bovine female possessed, in common with 
all mammals, the capacity to produce milk with which to 
nurture her young to a self-sustaining age. For this pur- 
pose she was required to give but a small amount, of 
ordinary quality, the scant flow of which was maintained 
by the succulent spring grasses whose growth was incident 
to the season at which she invariably calved. 
The modern domesticated dairy cow, on the other hand, 
has given annually, in record instances, milk equivalent 
in amount to from 25 to 30 times her own weight, and so 
rich in fat as to yield more than the equivalent of her 
weight in butter. Furthermore, she may be made to 
freshen any month in the year and to maintain the milk 
flow continuously for a period of years in some instances. 
Live-stock husbandry offers no more striking example 
of the development of a natural function by means 
of generations of selective breeding. 
216. Production. — The function of the dairy cow is to 
furnish, for any ten months in the year, milk in such quan- 
tity and of such quality as to return a fair margin of profit 
over the cost of maintenance of the cow herself and the 
additional expense of her production. 
217. Dairy form and function. — The province of the 
dairy cow can be best understood by considering her as a 
factory, of which the udder is the essential machine, and 
in this she stands intermediate between the grain bins  
-P-A-G-E-218
  198 LIV#-STOCK JUDGING 
and hay mows, as the sources of the raw materials, and the 
finished product in the pail. 
There is a most distinct correlation between form and 
function in the dairy cow; therefore a detailed con- 
sideration of each is essential to the intelligent judging 
of her. 
Milk is composed of 87.1 % water, and 12.9 % solids, 
of which .7 % is mineral matter, 3.2 % casein, 5.1 % sugar 
and 3.9% fat, the last three constituents being products of 
the udder, exclusively. Hence the udder is the final and 
determining factor in milk production, but its function is 
wholly dependent upon allied and prerequisite systems 
and organs. These will be taken up in order. 
218. Dairy temperament.— Since the production of 
beef and milk are in no way correlated but are extreme 
opposites, the primary factor in milk production is the 
absence of any tendency to beefiness. All the allied 
functions, as well as the secretory function of the udder 
itself, are so governed by the nervous system as to insure 
the most complete utilization of food nutrients exclusively 
for milk production, after maintenance requirements 
have been met. 
219. Reproduction. — Given the capacity to divert 
surplus nutrients from the body to the pail there must be 
furnished a motive for so doing. Although the un- 
developed udder of the virgin heifer and even the rudi- 
mentary gland of the bull may be stimulated to the actual 
production of milk, yet the calf isthe only means of bringing 
cows into a state of profitable production. Under modern 
methods of dairy husbandry the calf is commonly de- 
prived of that for the production of which he has furnished 
the incentive. Once fresh, a cow may be kept milking . 
continuously for years, sometimes, without the necessity
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE TYPES" 199 
of refreshening, although she is usually rebred so as to 
come in annually. 
220. Feeding capacity. — After being furnished with a 
reason for becoming functionally active it is necessary 
that the udder be supplied with the materials from 
which to produce milk. This function devolves upon 
the digestive system as a source of the nutrients and 
the circulatory system as a means of conveyance to the 
udder. 
221. Constitution. — In view of the record performances 
of some cows it is apparent that high production involves 
the expenditure of an enormous amount of energy and 
nerve force to sustain it. A race horse is hardly required to 
have more stamina and constitution than a cow on test, 
while resistance to disease is of even greater importance 
in her case on account of the artificial conditions under 
which she is kept producing. 
222. Udder. — The udder has been referred to as the 
essential machine of the milk factory, —the cow. It 
is not a mere reservoir in which the milk accumulates 
and from which it is simply withdrawn, but the udder 
is a gland with secretion as its function. While the glandu- 
lar arrangement does provide a receptacle for the milk 
as it is produced, secretion goes on most actively during 
the milking process, and is even controlled, within limits, 
by the cow at will. The active factors in milk production 
are the gland tissue cells which intervene between the 
terminal capillary ramifications of the blood vessels and 
the ultimate divisions of the interior of the udder (Fig. 99). 
The water, salt and some free albumen pass directly from 
the blood into the interior of the gland, but the greater part 
of the albumen undergoes transformation in its passage 
through the cell and reappears as casein. Fat and lactose 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  200 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
may also be considered the products of the cell, since they 
do not appear in the blood. Fat is produced by a special 
secretory activity of the cell itself during which its proto-

223. Dairy type (Figs. 100 and 101). — Since the produc- 
tion of milk and beef are not correlated, the dairy form is 
characterized by an extreme absence of all that pertains to 
beefiness. The form in general is triangular instead of rec-
-P-A-G-E-222
  202 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
tangular, outlining the so-called wedges, the appearance of 
which is contributed to by the features of structure already 
enumerated, the functions of which are prerequisite to milk 
production. Both reproduction and milk production are 
distinctly feminine functions, hence femininity should domi- 
nate the make-up of a dairy cow. The feminine form is 
  
  
  Fic. 100.— A typical dairy cow. 
characterized by a light, shallow, narrow forequarter and 
correspondingly greater width and depth of the hind- 
quarter. This, of itself, is suggestive of both a horizontal 
and a perpendicular wedge, the apex directed forward 
whether seen from the side or the front. The wedge or 
triangle suggestion is made more pronounced in the profile 
view by the base of the triangle being extended to the

and is, therefore, foreign to the dairy female. The very 
lean neck and fine throttle complete this under line, the 
head being eliminated from consideration. The light,

and the absence of beefiness, with the width on the floor

of the chest that a cow must have in order to insure ample 
heart and lung capacity, are responsible for a third tri- 
angle, the apex of which is directed upward and is most 
easily made out when the chine is looked down upon. A 
fourth, an inverted triangle, may be demonstrated in the 
hindquarters. The long, broad, level rump forms the 
base, while the light thighs, concave from both side and 
rear view, form lines which, inclining downward and 
inward, approximate an apex. These triangles or wedges, 
it should be understood, are the effect rather than the 
cause of a cow’s being productive, and mean little except 
that they represent capacity of the reproductive, digestive, 
respiratory, circulatory and nervous systems in a female 
whose proclivities are most extremely opposed to beef 
production.

Udder. The udder is considered last because its effi- 
ciency is not independent but is contingent upon all other 
structural and functional features of the cow. The three
-P-A-G-E-226
  206 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
essential features of the udder are its size, shape and tex- 
ture (Fig. 103). Size is determined by its attachments, 
which should be high up between the thighs behind and well 
forward along the abdominal wall below. These attach- 
ments may be 
considered as the 
basis of the ud- 
der, and are a 
reliable  indica- 
tion of its real 
size even in the 
dry cow or the 
one just milked 
out. It should 
not be necessary 
to “stretch” ud- 
ders in order to 
ascertain their 
size. The sus- 
pension from 
these attach- 
mentsshouldalso 
be considered. 
A pendant udder 
may have the 
appearance of 
being large, while 
in reality there 
is less gland present than in a much smaller but well- 
supported udder. With these points fixed, the shape of 
the udder is next concerned in establishing its capacity. 
The mammary gland is divisible, longitudinally, into two 
lateral halves, also transversely, into an anterior and a   
    Fi. 103. — Section of the cow’s udder showing the 
internal structure and arrangement of the gland.  
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE TYPES 207 
posterior or a fore and hind half. Therefore either half 
may be subdivided into quarters. The most capacious 
udder, size as fixed by attachments being equal, is the one 
in which all four quarters are equally well developed, pro- 
ducing a square and level shape. Finally, even though size 
and shape of udder are both good, there is one more factor 
that may still determine great variation in productiveness, 
and that is texture. The udder, like any other gland of the 
body, is composed of two kinds of tissue, the gland tissue 
proper which does the actual secreting of the milk, and an 
interstitial connective tissue of a fibrous nature which 
serves as a framework for the gland. It is obvious that 
the latter tissue has no part in the function of the udder, 
although a certain amount is necessary for the construc- 
tion of the gland. The udder that is most productive, 
therefore, is the one that contains the most of the active 
glandular tissue and only as much connective tissue as is 
required to support the gland. The relative proportions 
of these two kinds of tissue in the udder structure are 
indicated by the feel of the gland; if firm and beefy the 
connective tissue is in excess, while if soft, elastic and glove- 
like, being covered with a thin, pliable skin upon which is a 
light growth of fine hair and the blood vessels are distinctly 
marked, the udder is composed of the maximum amount of 
gland tissue proper and is capable of maximum production. 
Such an udder almost completely milks away, leaving only 
a few soft folds where, previous to milking, the udder had 
completely filled the space between the thighs. The former 
kind, on the other hand, appears of about the same size and 
shape after the milk has all been withdrawn. 
Udders may be so badly stretched by prolonging the 
periods between milkings, or cows may be judged in such 
varying stages of lactation that the udder alone cannot
-P-A-G-E-228
  208 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
always be considered to gauge a cow’s productive capac- 
ity. The mammary (milk) veins and wells are accessories 
which may be valuable aids in determining the capacity 
of an udder, especially if the cow is not in full milk. 
The mammary (milk) veins are the blood vessels which 
carry the blood away from the udder and the wells are 
the orifices in the abdominal wall through which the veins

tioned to the amount of blood which is supplied to the 
udder, the arteries being so deep seated as not to be visible 
(Fig. 104).!. A vein of large caliber and tortuous course 
indicates a large flow of blood to the udder, while a small 
vein passing directly from the udder to its well indicates 
1 The so-called milk veins are designated, anatomically, as the anterior 
mammary veins to distinguish them from the middle and posterior mam- 
mary veins which together drain the venous ring at the base of the udder.
-P-A-G-E-229
THE TYPES 209 
the opposite. Since the raw materials from which milk is 
produced are conveyed to the udder in the blood stream, 
the relation between blood supply and production is very 
intimate. The size of the wells corresponds to the size of 
the veins and the larger, more tortuous veins usually 
branch and send small ramifications through smaller wells, 
the so-called extensions, of which there may be two or three. 
The escutcheon, that area on the inner, posterior face 
of the thigh where the hair is directed the reverse way, 
was formerly believed to indicate the blood supply and 
through it the capacity of the udder. This theory was 
first advanced by Guenon, a Frenchman, but little im- 
portance is attached to it now. 
Teats should be placed in the center of the quarters 
and if the latter are of the proper size and shape the teats 
will all be equidistant and directed straight downward, 
in parallel lines. They should be of sufficient size to in- 
sure a good grasp with a man’s hand, short teats being an 
abomination in this country where men milkers are most 
common. The teats should not, however, be so long as to 
render them liable to be tramped upon by neighbors when 
the cow is lying down and the udder, with its teats, is 
protruded sideways. They should be regular in form 
and tapering. Supernumerary teats, while they may 
indicate extra development of the mammary system, are 
usually objectionable. 
2265. Quality.— Quality of cow and quality of milk are 
not correlated, exactly, yet the refinement of structure 
manifested by the cow may have a direct bearing on pro- 
ductiveness. The udder being composed of a framework 
of nonsecreting tissue and the essential secreting gland 
tissue which it supports, the more there is of the latter, 
the greater the capacity of the udder and the finer its 
=
-P-A-G-E-230
  210 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
texture. Quality implies a fine texture of udder just as 
much as of hide, hair and bone. 
Quality in the dairy cow is indicated by a hide of 
medium thickness, loose, pliable and unctuous, covered 
with a medium coat of fine, straight, lustrous hair; a 
high grade of bone, noted in a fine head, smooth shoulders, 
hooks, pins and tail head and sharply defined joints; 
horn of medium size, and dense, smooth texture. Coarse- 
ness is especially indicated in the parts enumerated and 
in a general absence of refinement. 
226. Substance, as indicated by size rather than by 
bone, is important, it having been demonstrated that the 
larger cow produces more economically than the smaller 
one. 
227. Constitution. — The consumption and utilization 
of the nutrients required for the production of 25,000 
pounds of milk or 1000 pounds of butter annually, in- 
volves the activity of the functions of digestion, respira- 
tion, circulation and lactation to their utmost capacity, 
and none but cows of the strongest constitutional vigor 
are capable of such performance. Constitution is indi- 
cated by a full chest, a deep flank, a large nostril, a 
bright eye, a sleek coat and general evidence of thrift 
and vigor. 
228. Condition of the dairy cow in milk is best ex- 
pressed by the term “spare.” Thin is suggestive of 
emaciation while a working dairy cow is in the best of 
health and thrift. Spare means without surplus, and that 
is most descriptive of ideal dairy cow condition when she 
is retaining from the ration sufficient nutrients for her 
maintenance only, utilizing all the balance for production. 
Lean is also expressive of the dairy condition, as it implies 
the absence of fat or beef.
-P-A-G-E-231
THE TYPES 211 
229. Temperament. — The dairy cow is of a nervous 
temperament compared to the lymphatic temperament of 
the beef steer. Resourceful in nerve force, yet not restive, 
is the ideal. Dairy temperament is indicated by evi- 
dence of nerve force as expressed by the eye, the absence 
of any beefy tendency, the spare condition associated 
with dairy capacity and an open, loose-made frame, 
especially in evidence in the chine. 
230. Dry cows. — One is often called upon to buy or 
place cows after the conclusion of one lactation period, 
and before they have freshened again. It is obviously a 
more difficult task to rate them aright under such condi- 
tions than when in full milk. The higher condition which 
they naturally acquire when not producing must be dis- 
tinguished from actual beefiness, and the inactive udder 
from one of normally limited capacity. The fat cow will 
show it most over the back, while the beefy cow is thick 
in the neck and thighs as well. The attachments of the 
udder high up behind and well forward, also its texture 
and balance may still be made out, although the form is 
much altered and the size reduced. The placing of the 
teats is a valuable guide in the case of the dry cow as well 
as in the heifer. 
231. Heifer calves. — The judging of young heifers 
involves some features not enumerated in the judging of 
milking cows. It cannot be expected that the calf will 
be a “perfect little cow.’ Like the feeder steer, she is 
the dairy cow in prospect, and must have embraced in 
her make-up the essential features of dairy form and func- 
tion, such as a refined, feminine head and neck, a loose, 
soft, sappy hide, ample chest and abdominal capacity 
and a suggestion of milkiness in both fore and hind 
quarters (Fig. 105). Special importance is attached to

-P-A-G-E-233
  THE TYPES 213 
the size and placing of the teats, they being about all 
of the mammary apparatus that is apparent at this age. 
Teats of uniform size, placed equidistant and well apart, 
are indicative of a large, well-formed udder at maturity. 
Heifers, like dry cows, are usually in higher condition 
than after calving, when their fat ‘“‘ milks away,” as it is 
commonly described. 
232. Method of inspection.— The cow should be 
viewed first from in front, noting her feminine appear- 
ance, her triangular wedge shape and size, then, more in 
detail, the size, dimensions, proportions, contour and 
features of her head; passing to the side, observe again 
the wedge form, outlined by her top and under line, also 
her head in profile, her throat, the length and leanness of 
her neck, the lightness and the sharpness of her shoulder 
and chine, the depth of her forerib, the thickness through 
the lower part of her chest, the great, depth of back rib, 
the width of loin and hips, the length, levelness, leanness 
and smoothness of her rump and the extreme leanness of 
her thighs; from the side the hide over the back rib is 
handled to determine its thickness, looseness, pliability, 
the amount and fineness of the hair and the abundance 
and the color of the skin secretions, these secretions being 
also examined in the ears, under the tail and at the depth 
of the switch. Also, from this position, the size, form 
and texture of the udder, the size and placing of the teats, 
sogether with the size and course of the mammary veins and 
wells may be determined. This examination should be 
continued from the rear position, in which may also be 
made out the inverted, perpendicular wedge of the hind- 
quarters, the width of loin, hips and hindquarters, the 
relative width of hook bones and pin bones, the leanness 
of thighs, the width between them and finally the es-
-P-A-G-E-234
  214 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
cutcheon, its extent and form. The inspection is con- 
cluded by a look at the other side, noting again, as has 
already been done, the openness of the form as indicated 
in the chine especially, and the general spare appearance 
indicative of the dairy temperament. It is well to move 
the cows about in order to verify or extend one’s estimate 
of them. 
DvAL-PURPOSE CATTLE 
233. Production. — Cows of this type are to serve the 
twofold purpose of milk and beef. In principle and theory 
the dual-purpose idea is subject to some logical opposition, 
but the dual-purpose cow is a matter of fact, 90% of the 
milk supply of London being derived from milking Short- 
horns, the breed that also furnishes a large part of the 
beef consumed in Great Britain. The principle is 
opposed on the ground that milk and beef are extreme 
opposites under the law of correlation, and therefore their 
joint production, in the same animal, is contrary to the 
laws of nature. And so it is if extreme production in both 
lines is attempted, but between any two extremes is a 
mean, represented by an intermediate or halfway position. 
It is, therefore, perfectly reasonable to expect from one 
individual the production of milk to the extent of one 
half the normal in dairy cows, and the production of a 
carcass of beef at least 50% as valuable and one half as 
economically produced as in the case of a typical beef 
steer. This is all that should be attempted and ap- 
parently all that can be accomplished in the perfection 
of the dual-purpose cow. The great difficulty seems to 
be that breeders are not satisfied to maintain this middle 
ground, but are ambitious to make either dairy or slaughter 
records with their so-called dual-purpose cattle. Even 
the judging of the leading dual-purpose breéds has been
-P-A-G-E-235
  THE TYPES 215 
  
  Fie. 106.— A typical dual-purpose cow. 
most inconsistent on this account. One judge, presum- 
ably from the Middle West, will lay special stress on the 
beef form, with an utter disregard for udders, while an 
Eastern judge is just as liable to place the cows in the 
order of dairy merit only.
-P-A-G-E-236
  216 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
The half-and-half principle is fundamental, and when- 
ever it is deviated from, the dual purpose is defeated. 
The ideal dual-purpose cow is one which will produce 
milk of such quantity and quality as to return a profit 
over and above her cost of keep, and at the same time 
possess a sufficiently beefy form to insure her male calves 
feeding satisfactorily into acceptable butcher cattle, while 
she herself and her daughters will yield a profitable 
carcass when their usefulness in the dairy is over. 
Another difficulty in the way of dual-purpose attain- 
ment on the part of the breeder is the fact that the prop- 
osition is self-limiting. Many of the best dual-purpose 
cows are bought up by dairymen who follow the practice 
of milking a cow only through one milking period, then 
turning her to beef and the butcher. Thus the breeding 
value of the best cows is lost, and what calves there are 
produced are likely to have second-rate cows for their dams. 
234. The dual-purpose type. — The half-and-half idea 
also prevails in the make-up of the dual-purpose cow 
(Fig. 106). She has considerable scale, more than is com- 
mon in dairy cows, her form is less beefy than is typical 
of the steer, but more beefy than the typical dairy cow, 
while she is less milky in form than the representative 
dairy cow, but more milky than the fat steer. Her udder 
will probably be-as large as that of a dairy cow, but inferior 
to it in both form and texture. Heifer calves should 
develop into the likeness of their dams, and the bull calves 
follow the same general type, but, being males, they will 
incline more naturally to beefiness. In practice it seems 
to be less difficult to get a cow that will give 10,000 
pounds of milk annually and still retain her beef form, 
and make a profitable and acceptable carcass, than to 
secure from her a male calf that will make a steer al- 
together satisfactory to either feeder or butcher.

The chief features by which typical representatives of 
each of the breeds may be differentiated are size, form, 
character of head, hide and color. 
235. The Short-horn. — This, the first of the beef breeds 
to be improved, and the one to which were devoted the 
efforts of that select group of eighteenth century stock 
men, who proved out the theories of Bakewell, and estab- 
lished the principles upon which modern live-stock hus- 
bandry is practiced, is of extraordinary importance because 
of the improvement wrought by it on the common stock the 
world over. The representative Short-horn (Fig. 107) is 
essentially a beef animal, and unless specially qualified 
should be so considered. (Milking Short-horns are dis- 
cussed in the dual-purpose group.) Short-horns may be 
differentiated from the other beef breeds by greater size,

the cows weighing 1400 to 1600 pounds, and the bulls 
1800 to 2400 pounds; a more distinctly rectangular form, 
especially marked at the ends, on account of the square 
brisket and very long, broad and deep thighs, and a pro- 
portionately broader and flatter back, particularly toward 
the hindquarters; a head full of character and refinement, 
horns that are short, medium fine, white and waxy in 
appearance with black tips and well curved; and a hide

of medium thickness, loose, pliable and sappy, covered 
with a heavy but mossy coat of hair. The Short-horn 
colors are red and white, either one exclusively or both 
in any possible combination, as red, white, spotted or 
roan. The whites are no longer discriminated against, 
nor are the reds especially preferred, while roan is re- 
garded as the most representative color. 
Typical Short-horns should give evidence of early

maturity and rapid fattening, and promise of dressing out 
most profitably a high-class carcass of beef. A lack of 
general conformity to the most approved beef type is 
sometimes noticeable in this breed, some leggy individuals 
appearing in the ranks. Also rough hips, a drooping 
rump and a tendency to accumulate fat unevenly in 
patches about the tail head and the pin bones are un-

desirable features, which breeders have endeavored to 
eliminate. 
236. Polled Durham (Fig. 108).— This breed is an 
American derivation from a straight Short-horn founda- 
tion, chiefly, the majority of Polled Durhams being double- 
standard, and therefore entitled to full registration in 
the Short-horn herd book. The-aim of the Polled Dur- 
ham breeders is to duplicate the Short-horn in all respects 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  220 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
except the horns, and they are, therefore, judged on the 
same basis. 
237. The Hereford.— This breed, developed from a race 
of cattle native to Herefordshire, England, a district noted 
for its grassland, received mention as early as 1627 for 
being unusually economic and rapid producers of beef, 
characters for which the breed is still most noted. They 
have the reputation, in this country, of meeting, excep-

tionally well, the conditions of our southwestern range 
country where beef is made from grass and frequently 
under most adverse climatic conditions, such as drought. 
Herefords are also conspicuous in the feed lots of the 
Middle West. 
There is a striking uniformity among the best represent- 
atives of the Hereford breed (Fig. 109), especially in the 
matter of color. They are among the heaviest of beef
-P-A-G-E-241
  THE BREEDS OF CATTLE 221 
cattle, although, being unusually low and blocky, they do 
not appear to possess as much actual scale as Short-horns 
do. The form is less square and more cylindrical than that 
of the Short-horns, their thighs being full and rounded, 
rather than straight. The head is short and broad, 
eyes prominent, the skin about the eyes and the muzzle 
being flesh-colored; the horns are rather strong, cream- 
colored, with no black at the tips, spreading, and in bulls 
directed forward with a characteristic droop. The hide 
is somewhat heavy, but loose and pliable, and covered 
with an abundant coat of long, curly but soft and fine 
hair, which covers the forehead in heavy curls and hangs 
in locks from the ears. The color, while originally the 
cause of much dissension among Hereford breeders, has 
become a most distinct and characteristic feature. Other 
breeds are red and white, but the distribution of the 
white in the Hereford is most regular. The face, usually 
including the ears, jaws and throat, is white, evidence of 
the old mottled faces being noticeable sometimes in red 
spots about the eyes; the under side of the neck, the dew 
lap, the brisket, more or less of the under line, the legs 
and the switch are also white, and, most curious of all, 
there is a clear-cut white stripe on top of the neck from 
about its middle to the top of the shoulders. The balance 
of the neck, body and legs are red, either of light, medium 
or dark shade, the medium being preferred. On account 
of the regularity with which these white markings occur, 
the Herefords are popularly known as ‘‘ White Faces.” 
238. The Aberdeen-Angus.— Two distinct races of 
polled cattle have existed in Scotland since the earliest 
times of which we have record, one in northeastern Scot- 
land, which was later evolved into our modern Aberdeen- 
Angus, and the other in southwestern Scotland, the ante-
-P-A-G-E-242
  222 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
cedents of the Galloways. The hornless cattle of north- 
eastern Scotland, the best of which were black, first 
attracted attention on account of the superior carcasses of 
beef which they dressed out. Their pioneer breeder was a 
cattle buyer, who early appreciated their butcher value 
and bred for improvement along that line. Partisans of 
the breed to-day assign to them first rank among butcher 
  
    
Fie. 110.— An Aberdeen-Angus bull. 
beasts as attested by actual competition in slaughter tests 
to which they refer. Aberdeen-Angus cattle do possess a 
fineness of bone, a wealth of natural flesh, a capacity to 
finish evenly and smoothly with a resultant splendid 
marbling of the lean, which is distinctive of them. 
Angus cattle (Fig. 110) are heavy on account of their 
compact build, but they are not, as a rule, as large as 
either Short-horns or Herefords. Their form is most
-P-A-G-E-243
THE BREEDS OF CATTLE 223 
characteristic ; they are extremely short-legged and have 
a distinctly cylindrical contour, being compact, rotund 
and smooth. Their naturally fine frame is amplified by 
an unusual muscular system, which leaves no angles or 
points in their outline. The head is also readily dis- 
tinguished from the head of other polled cattle. The 
forehead is especially broad between the eyes, tapering 
distinctly from that point to the muzzle below, and upward 
to the pole, which is prominent, and sharply defined. The 
hide is of medium thickness, very mellow and covered 
with a good coat of thick, but soft and short hair. Com- 
pared with the rough coats of the other beef breeds, the 
Angus coat is smooth. The color should be black with 
no reddish or brindle cast, as was common among some of 
the foundation animals of the breed. White on the under 
line back of the navel is permissible, but undesirable. 
Heavy open shoulders, scurs, the occurrence of red or 
brindle color, or too much white are characters which 
Angus breeders guard against. 
239. The Galloway. — Although the oldest and purest 
of the beef breeds, the Galloway cattle are the last to be 
bred for systematic improvement, and results have been 
most marked during the past decade. They have done 
best in this country on the northwestern ranges, where 
their protective coats, hardihood and rustling ability 
have enabled them to do well under most rigorous con- 
ditions. 
While both are black and polled, the breed characters 
of the Galloway and Angus are not difficult to distinguish. 
Galloways (Fig. 111) average lighter in weight than the 
representatives of the other beef breeds described. Their 
form is less cylindrical than the Angus or Hereford, hav- 
ing more of the square outline of the Short-horn, but
-P-A-G-E-244
  224 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
with less breadth and thickness. The head is somewhat 
longer than that of the Angus, but is of more uniform 
width, not tapering to the muzzle nor to the poll, but 
broad at the crown with an oval-shaped, rather than a 
high-pointed, poll. The ears are carried in a peculiar 
fashion characteristic of this breed. They are set well 
forward and high, and may be pointed upward and for-

ward. The hide is of medium thickness, loose and pliable, 
and covered with a coat of hair which furnishes one of 
the most distinctive characters of the breed. The coat is 
really double, a soft, fine, mossy or furry under coat being 
overlaid with a long, curly, heavy hair coat, which gives 
them an extremely shaggy appearance with a heavy mat 
of curls on the forehead and locks in the ears. Hides taken 
when the cattle are in full coat sell at a premium on
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE BREEDS OF CATTLE 225 
account of their value for coats, robes, rugs, etc. The 
color of the Galloway is black with a peculiar cinnamon 
tinge, especially noticeable in the under coat and the 
coat of new-born calves in which it predominates. Any 
white on the extremities or above the under line is ob- 
jectionable. 
The first Galloways brought forward in this country 
were very rough, unsymmetrical individuals, especially 
deficient in spread of rib, and slow to mature and ripen. 
Some individuals of the breed still show deficiencies in 
these respects in spite of the great improvement that has 
been wrought. Prominent tail heads, heavy shoulders, 
with a disproportionate height between fore and hind 
quarters, forequarters being low, flat ribs and an absence 
of condition are respects in which the breed is still subject 
to some correction. Too much white and the presence 
of scurs will also count against Galloways. 
240. The Jersey. — A definite scale of points having 
been formulated and agreed upon by the Island breeders 
as early as 1835, since which time great care has been 
taken to keep the blood lines pure, Jerseys are very uni- 
form in breed type and character (Fig. 112). Cows 
weigh 800 to 1000 pounds, bulls 1200 to 1500 pounds. 
Their form is especially symmetrical, although distinctly 
dairy, and shows great refinement. The head is short, 
broad and deep, the face lean and distinctly dished be- 
tween the eyes, the eyes wide apart and unusually prom- 
inent, ears small, fine and showing rich yellow secretion 
within, the muzzle black or dark blue surrounded by a 
light, mealy colored strip of hair and skin, the horns 
small, fine, white, sharply incurving, waxy in appearance 
and usually black tipped. The skin is thin, loose, mellow, 
yellow in color, showing an abundance of rich secretion 
Q

  226 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
and covered with a very fine, smooth coat of hair. Fawn 
is the typical Jersey color, ranging from the lightest lemon. 
to the very dark or mulberry fawn. The darker colors are 
preferred on bulls. The presence of much white is gener- 
ally considered objectionable in this country, although i 
is not mentioned in the scale of points, and some of the 
most meritorious animals of the breed have been spotted. 
  
    
  Fig. 112.— A Jersey cow. 
Registry rules require that account be taken of the color 
of the tongue and the switch, whether light or dark. 
The typical udder is characterized especially by its 
good texture and shape, size being commendable also 
when the size of the cow is considered. The teats are not 
large, but are well placed, and the veins are especially well 
developed, being very tortuous in their course, knotted 
in appearance and entering the abdominal cavity through 
large and usually several openings. 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
THE BREEDS OF CATTLE 227 
Some Jerseys manifest a tendency to be undersized, 
too fine in bone and deficient in constitutional vigor. 
Their udders are also sometimes too small, not well 
balanced in front and with teats that are too short. 
Distinction is usually made in this country between 
the Island and the American bred types of Jerseys. The 
former is characterized by much more symmetry and

refinement, while the latter are cattle of greater size, 
more rugged appearance but of less uniform type. 
241. The Guernsey. — While also native to one of the 
Channel Islands and derived practically from the same 
foundation, the Guernsey differs in many essentials from 
the Jersey (Fig. 113). They were not bred for points nor 
were such early efforts put forth to render them especially 
productive. They are, therefore, larger and plainer, of 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
    228 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
more substantial appearance, the cows weighing about 
1000 and the bulls 1500 pounds; their form is indicative 
of dairy capacity, but is less symmetrical and refined and 
shows greater variation than that of the Jersey. The head 
is longer, with a comparatively straight face line, no dish, 
although the orbits are raised with unusual prominence ; 
the muzzle is flesh or cream colored, a smutty appearance 
not being permitted, and the horns are medium sized, 
amber colored and symmetrically shaped. The skin 
affords one of the most striking features of Guernsey 
breed type in its rich, yellow color and the abundance of 
its highly colored secretions. This color is manifested 
wherever the skin is denuded of hair, as about the eyes, 
under the tail, on the udder and teats and even in the 
appendages of the skin, as the horns and the hoof, 
which are also of the deep amber hue. (Guernseys are 
most commonly of a reddish fawn shade, broken by a 
considerable amount of white, although solid colors of 
other shades of fawn are not rare. The udder of the 
Guernsey cow is of good size, shape and texture with large 
teats, and veins to correspond. The lack of uniformity 
in shape already referred to in the description of the cows 
is even more noticeable in their udders, fore udders 
especially being deficient, with all four quarters cut up in 
many individuals. 
242. The Holstein-Friesian.— This lowland race of 
dairy cattle reflect in their great size, their open frame 
and their enormous capacity both to consume and to 
produce, the environment under which they have been 
developed. 
They are much the largest of any of the dairy breeds 
(Fig. 114), the cows weighing from 1200 to 1500 pounds 
and the bulls 2000 pounds or over. They have a most ca- 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  THE BREEDS OF CATTLE 229 
pacious but milky form, frequently standing on longer legs 
than representatives of the other dairy breeds. The head 
is the longest and leanest of any, with comparatively small 
fine horns; the skin is of medium thickness, loose and 
pliable, showing an abundance of highly colored secretion 
  
      
Fie, 114,— A Holstein-Friesian cow. 
and covered with a coat of soft hair. The color is black 
and white, more or less of either. Red and white, while 
not uncommon in Holland, is not acceptable to the registry 
association in this country. 
The udder of the representative Holstein-Friesian is
-P-A-G-E-250
  23005: LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
very large and voluminous in accordance with its pro- 
ductive capacity, which in quantity surpasses any. The 
veins are also large and tortuous and the teats match the 
udder in size. 
Some Holstein-Friesians are deficient in dairy tempera- 
ment, showing a disposition to be beefy. Also heavy 
hides, drooping rumps, too pendant udders, which in

against. 
243. The Ayrshire. — Representatives of this breed,

(Fig. 115), although it shows much less refinement than 
the Jersey, and Ayrshire cattle are of very uniform type. 
They lack some of the angularity which characterizes the 
dairy breeds, although the most typical individuals give 
no suggestion of beefiness. They are more short legged 
and compact in body than is usual in dairy cows. The 
Ayrshire head is very characteristic; it is of medium 
length and width, not especially fine, but surmounted 
with long, strong, symmetrical, white horns inclining 
generally upward, forward and outward with consid- 
erable spread, and a peculiar backward turn at the tips. 
The hide is of medium thickness, mellow and pliable, 
the secretions of a rich yellow or brownish color and the 
hair coat fairly heavy but fine. The most typical Ayr- 
shire color is white and a peculiar red with a brownish 
cast (wine colored). The old-fashioned Ayrshire was 
more often red with white spots, while the more approved 
type now is white with red spots. The red is sometimes 
brindled, but this is undesirable. 
The udder of the Ayrshire is one of its most distinctive 
features. In shape, especially in fore udder development, 
and in texture it is unsurpassed, while its size is greater 
than at first apparent, on account of the snug manner in 
which it is suspended against the abdominal wall. The 
teats are rather short but well placed, the floor of the 
udder being remarkably level, on account of the even 
development of all four quarters. Short teats are the 
charge most frequently brought against this breed, 
although some udders do not have sufficient capacity and 
some cows are undersized.

from a very old race of cattle in the mountains of Switzer- 
land. They have been generally considered a dual-

purpose breed, but in order to erentieey dairy production 
the Brown Swiss Cattle Breeders’ Association have de- 
clared them a dairy breed. 
They are of medium size, bulls averaging about 1800 
pounds in weight, cows 1200 pounds (Fig. 116). Their 
form is characterized by a prominence of frame, as shown

in the bone of the head, shoulders and cannons. They are 
lower set and less angular than the other dairy breeds. 
The head is long, broad and dished between the eyes, 
the horns rather short and flat, directed outward and up- 
ward with black tips. The hide is of more than usual thick- 
ness, but soft and pliable. Color is a peculiar shade of 
brown or brownish fawn, varying from light to dark, 
with a light tuft at the poll, inside the ears and along the

back, a mealy colored muzzle, black nose, tongue and

teats. 
Coarseness of bone in head and shoulders, and an inclina- 
tion to be beefy are rather uniformly noted in this breed.

Belted cattle are smaller than the Holsteins, cows weigh-

They are of well-marked dairy form; heads are long and 
slightly dished, with long, fine, spreading horns, and dark . 
tongues. Color is most distinctive, being black with a 
clearly defined white belt passing completely around the 
body, wide enough to just miss the shoulders in front 
and the hips behind, and showing no irregularities in 
outline. The udders are of good size and well developed.

and the beef propensities of the Norfolk stock, is charac- 
terized by a uniformly red color, polled head and the 
capacity to produce milk in large quantity and yet retain 
the beef form in fair degree. They weigh 1200 to 1500 
pounds for cows, 1800 to 2000 pounds for bulls. The form 
is that of the dual-purpose type. The head is of medium 
width, dished between the eyes and well finished with a
-P-A-G-E-255

prominent poll. The hide is loose, mellow and pliable 
even though of medium thickness, and the hair coat is 
fine, though abundant. The color is some shade of red, 
the cherry red being preferable to either the lighter or the 
darker shades. White is permissible in the switch, on 
the udder or along the under line as far as the navel only. 
The udder is usually well developed for so beefy a cow, 
but it lacks balance, the forequarters frequently being

deficient, and it is often of the pendant sort with large 
teats. The veins and wells are proportionately well 
developed. 
The tendency, already noted, for dual-purpose cattle 
to deviate to one or the other extremes is responsible for 
a lack of uniformity in the type of the Red Polled. They

are also subject to the occasional occurrence of scurs, as 
are all other polled breeds. 
247. The Milking Short-horn (Fig. 119). — This is a 
family within the breed, there being a rather sharp dis- 
tinction between the blood lines of Milking Short-horns 
and the regular or beef Short-horns. The former are 
largely descendant from a Bates foundation. They have 
the general Short-horn character but more of a dual- 
purpose form.

  CHAPTER XIII 
THE TYPES OF SHEEP 
Frocks of domesticated sheep, Ovis, species musimon, 
or ammon, are referred to in the very earliest records of 
husbandry. They were kept, however, for their fleeces, 
the evolution of the mutton sheep having been accom- 
plished at a comparatively recent date by the English hus- 
bandmen contemporary with or subsequent to Bakewell. 
Sheep, being ruminants, have an economic importance 
similar to that of cattle but they fit into a niche which 
cattle do not fill. Sheep are much better rustlers, con- 
sume many weeds and grasses which cattle refuse, graze 
closer, and therefore do fairly well on rough, unproduc- 
tive lands, where cattle could not subsist. They are also 
natural gleaners and much that would otherwise be waste, 
in stubble fields, may be saved by turning in sheep. 
Then they have the advantage of maturing and reproduc-: 
ing at an earlier age than cattle. 
The prevailing high price of beef has materially increased 
the consumption of mutton. This and the low price of 
wool have resulted in a much better grade of mutton 
being offered to the consumer. Sheep are now much more 
generally mutton bred, fed to a higher degree of ripeness 
and sold as lambs or yearlings. 
248. Types of sheep. — While every sheep may yield 
both a mutton carcass and a fleece the two products are 
not correlated, and both are, therefore, seldom secured, in 
239
-P-A-G-E-260
  240 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
equally high degrees of excellence, from the same individual. 
As a rule, the sheep with the best mutton carcass shears a 
comparatively poor fleece, while the sheep that grows the 
greatest amount of finest wool is not wholly acceptable 
to the butcher, dressing out, with excessive waste, a light, 
ill-shaped carcass of low quality mutton. Hence, there 
are two distinct types of sheep, one grown for its carcass, 
in whose case the wool constitutes a by-product, and the 
other, kept primarily for its fleece and having a butcher - 
value analogous to that of the dairy cow. Sheep of the 
former type are in the majority, however, even their 
fleeces supplying the bulk of the wool that is marketed. 
It is not profitable under present conditions to maintain 
flocks for their fleeces only, as used to be extensively 
practiced. 
Murron Suuep 
The mutton wether is as close an analogy for the beef 
steer, already described, as it is possible for a sheep to be. 
Mutton and beef may be regarded as contemporaneous 
before the meat eaters of the world. 
249. Production. — Nearly all of the mutton dressed 
is consumed fresh, therefore primeness in the carcass is 
especially desirable. On account of their lesser size, 
mutton carcasses are most commonly handled entire by 
the wholesaler, neither split into sides nor quartered, as 
in the case of beef. Preference for lamb is shown in 
this country almost to the exclusion of a sheep carcass 
of any other age. From two thirds to three fourths of all 
\. the sheep slaughtered here are lambs, while the Briton 
appreciates, as well, the flesh of a prime yearling wether. 
Lamb can be distinguished from mutton by the relative 
sizes of the carcasses, by the softer consistence of both

lean and fat, a somewhat lighter color and the incomplete 
ossification of the so-called “break” joints of the knees 
and hocks, viz., the union between the centers of ossifica- 
tion in the end and the shaft of the forearm and lower 
thigh bones, respectively. The division of the carcass is 
shown in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 120). 
250. The mutton carcass cuts (Fig. 120). — The mutton 
carcass is not usually split at first but instead is divided 
into two transverse halves, a saddle and a rack, the cut 
being made between the twelfth and thirteenth ribs. The 
posterior or back half, the saddle, is subsequently divided 
into the leg of mutton and the loin, the forward half or 
rack into the short rack, chuck and breast. 
251. The saddle, which weighs slightly less than the 
rack, is cut at the point of the hip or margin of the loin 
into the legs of mutton, which are afterward separated 
and trimmed, and the loin, the former being about twice 
as heavy as the latter. 
262. The rack, counting forward ten ribs from the 
saddle end, is cut between the second and third ribs. 
The upper part of this section of the rack constitutes the 
short rack, the lower part the breast, the line of division 
being more or less arbitrarily determined, as in the steer. 
The short rack represents from two thirds to three fourths 
the value of the rack, although but about two fifths its 
weight. The balance of the carcass, including and in 
front of the second rib, is the chuck, or shoulder and, 
with the breast, is designated the stew. 
The highest priced cuts are taken from the short rack 
(rib chops), the leg of mutton, the loin (loin chops) and 
the stew, in the order named. Sheep dress 45-63% of 
their live weight, yearlings averaging a higher percentage 
than lambs.

and shape of the head also whether covered with wool or

the breed as does also the presence or absence of horns. 
The horns of the horned breeds should be strong, or fine, 
depending upon sex, of good texture and symmetrical in

back of the poll and begins there to swell into the width 
of the shoulders, being especially full in the neck vein. 
Typical shoulders are broad, not prominent, but closely 
laid in, and well covered with flesh, both at the side, where 
they are apt to be bare, and over the top, where they are 
often too open, that is, having too much space between 
the tips of the shoulder blades and the spine; the back
-P-A-G-E-265
  THE TYPES OF SHEEP 245 
straight, strong, broad and especially thickly covered 
with flesh; the ribs well arched and deep, especially the 
forerib, the crops so well filled as to be even with the 
sides of the shoulders; the chest deep, full, broad on the 
floor, and square at the brisket; the loin broad, and 
thickly fleshed, this region being most frequently bare ; 
the hips broad, level, smooth and not too prominent; the 
rump long, level, broad and smooth, especially at the 
dock, where there may be an accumulation of blubbery 
tallow; the leg of mutton broad, deep and thick, the 
twist full and well let down in the seam; the legs short, 
straight, pasterns and hocks strong, the sheep standing 
well up on its toes, and having straight hind legs. 
255. Quality in the sheep not only determines the 
quality of the meat, as in the case of cattle and hogs, but 
of the fleece as well. It is also an important factor in 
dressing percentage, as it controls the waste to a consider- 
able extent. Quality is indicated by a refined head and 
ears, smooth shoulders and hips, clean-boned joints and 
cannons, fine hair on the face, ears and legs, fine fleece and 
a trim under line. 
256. Condition. — Fat contributes to the primeness of 
a cut of mutton or lamb about as much as it does to beef, 
although the mutton carcass, while somewhat fatter, 
does not naturally marble quite so nicely as the beef 
carcass does, and tallow is less nutritious, digestible and 
palatable than suet. The most acceptable butcher condi- 
tion is indicated by a uniform covering of firm, but not 
hard, flesh, showing especially at the dock, the neck and 
along the back, with no bareness of loin or rib, nor any 
accumulation of soft fat in the foreflank, which has 
“slipped ” from the ribs above, nor at the tail head, on 
the back rib, or the margin of the loin, where rolls appear.

Woot. SHEEP 
The fleece was the first animal product to be improved 
by selection and breeding, and its improvement antedates 
the era of modern husbandry by centuries. The royal 
robes of the ancient nobility were woven from wool that 
would compare favorably with that from our modern 
flocks. The development of the mutton breeds, on the 
other hand, was begun less than 200 years ago. Prior to 
1893 wool growing was one of the most important live- 
stock industries in this country, and American Merinos 
were exported in large numbers to Australia, South 
America and South Africa. Subsequent reduction in the 
price of wool and an advance in the demand and the price 
paid for mutton resulted in a reversal of patronage and a 
great diminution in the fine wool flocks in this country. 
257. Production. — The fleece, originally furnished to 
the sheep in amount and character sufficient only for its 
protection, has been increased in quantity and improved 
in texture until it may actually be a serious burden both 
to bear on account of its weight and to endure on account 
of its warmth. 
The annual fleece may constitute as much as one fifth 
of the sheep’s weight, and the total amount of wool pro- 
duced in the sheep’s life may far exceed the weight of its 
body. 
Sheep are classified, on the basis of fleece, as long wool, 
middle wool and fine wool. Fleeces of the first two classes 
are shorn from sheep of mutton form, while the fine wool 
sheep are devoted to wool production, primarily. 
258. The classification of wool.— Market wool is 
classified according to the length and strength of its 
staple and consequently the material into which it can
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE TYPES OF SHEEP 247 
be manufactured, as clothing, delaine and combing, in 
each of which there are different commercial grades. 
259. Clothing. — Clothing wool is of fine, short staple, 
about two inches in length and goes into the highest grade 
of woolen cloth. Clothing wools are graded on their 
quality into Picklock, XXX, XX, X, No. 1, or one half 
blood; No. 2, or three eighths blood and No. 3, or one 
fourth blood. 
260. Delaine wool is fine, but longer than clothing, two 
to three inches, of sound staple and is used in the manu- 
facture of delaine cloths. Delaine wools are graded 
as fine, medium and low. 
261. Combing wool is characterized by the length and 
strength of its staple, being at least three inches in length 
and strong enough to withstand the combing process. It 
is made up into worsted goods. Such along wool is natu- 
rally coarse, the finest grading only No. 2 or three eighths. 
262. The type of the wool sheep grown to-day is much 
less extreme in form than the more distinctly wool, and 
wool only, type of a quarter of a century ago. The 
relative reduction and increase in the price of wool and 
mutton, respectively, has led to a demand for better - 
mutton, even in w9ol sheep, so that the common source 
of the finest fleeces now is, in reality, a dual purpose 
sheep. As a result of the inevitable law of correlation, 
under which mutton and wool are almost as much 
opposed to one another as beef and milk or lard and bacon, 
the old-fashioned, fine wool sheep were the extreme op- 
posite of the mutton sheep in form. They were small, 
with long legs, heads, necks and bodies, of an angular, 
rather than a blocky, form, having light quarters, peeked 
ends and flat ribs. Sheep of this type not only grew wool 
of the finest staple, but also in great amounts. They were
-P-A-G-E-268
  248 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
covered from tip to toe, well wooled under the belly and in 
the arm pits and groin, where most sheep are comparatively 
bare. In addition, they presented the maximum skin area 
from which to grow the fleece by virtue of the elaborate 
system of folds into which their skin was thrown. In 
response to modern demand this form has been increased 
in size, and its angularity has been amplified into rotund- 
ness, at least, insuring not only more of a carcass but 
greater constitutional vigor. The folds and wrinkles have 
been almost completely bred out, fine wool sheep being 
classified at the present time as to the presence or absence 
of wrinkles. 
263. Conformation. — Attention has already been di- 
rected to the fact that the market demands an acceptable 
mutton carcass from every sheep, even though they 
may be primarily wool producers. The conformation of 
the wool sheep, therefore, follows that already described 
for the mutton sheep as far as is consistent with fine wool 
production, and does not depart therefrom in the same 
extreme degree as does the dairy cow from the beef steer. 
It is generally characterized, however, by being more 
sparely furnished with natural flesh and by having less 
breadth and fullness of parts than is characteristic of 
the mutton sheep. 
264. Quality. — There is naturally associated with the 
fine fleece by which this sheep is distinguished an unusual 
degree of refinement. They are not large, and while 
somewhat unsymmetrical in shape they have fine heads, 
clean bone, delicate, pink skins, and what hair there is 
on the tip of their noses and legs matches, in fineness, 
the fleece with which they are covered. 
265. The fleece. — Quantity, quality and condition are 
the essentials of a good fleece. Quantity is determined by
-P-A-G-E-269
  THE TYPES OF SHEEP 248 
length and density which, however, are not correlated but 
opposed, thus making the longest fleece the most open, 
as a rule. There should be sought, therefore, such a 
balance between the length of staple and the density with 
which they grow, as will insure neither being sacrificed to 
the other, the maximum of both being secured. 
266. Quality involves primarily the texture of the in- 
dividual staple, which, in turn, is in proportion to the 
amount of crimp. The finest, shortest, densest fleeces 
have the closest crimp, while the coarsest, longest, most 
open fleeces have the crimp enlarged to kinks or ringlets. 
The finer wools, of more delicate texture, are usually 
possessed of a distinct luster, a feature of the fiber itself 
and independent of either yolk or discoloration. 
267. Condition of the fleece depends upon soundness, 7.e. 
whether or not the fiber has made a regular uninterrupted 
growth, as shown by continuous crimp of uniform degree, 
and no break in the staple itself; yolk, the secretion of 
the skin, through the wool, which should be sufficiently 
abundant to indicate normal activity of all vital functions 
of the sheep, yet not excessive to be scoured out prior 
to manufacture, nor dry and flaky, which indicates some 
constitutional disturbance, usually resulting from im- 
proper feeding; softness, the resistance offered by the 
fleece to pressure of the hand, as opposed to harshness, in 
which case the fibers do not yield, but grate against each 
other; purity, which refers to the absence of such foreign 
matter as sand, cockle burrs and hay seed, also kemp, a 
vestige of the old hair coat which sometimes makes its 
appearance in coarse fleeces and renders them of less 
value for manufacture, because the kempy fibers do not 
take the dye; and brightness, as opposed to discoloration, 
the natural fleece being white, or cream tinted if there is
-P-A-G-E-270
  250 ss LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
much yolk in it, while any discoloration tends to darken it. 
The brightest fleeces are taken from sheep that are kept 
under the best systems of care and management, while 
the sheep that are grown on the open range, for instance, 
have their fleeces badly soiled. 
268. Method of inspection. — Sheep present difficulties, 
on account of their fleeces, which require special means of 
making accurate observations and determinations of their 
conformation. Their form is so effectively obscured by the 
fleece, which may be further complicated by the shepherd’s 
clever trimming, as to make most careful handling neces- 
sary. The hands should not be depended upon alto- 
gether, however. The lines, general contour, length 
and strength of the legs, the width between them and the 
style and carriage of the sheep can best be made out 
by viewing them from a little distance. Then thorough 
handling must be resorted to in order to verify conclusions 
arrived at by looking the sheep over. It is especially 
important that the handling should be systematically 
done, in order that omissions and repetitions may be 
avoided, and a definite and accurate idea of the sheep 
formed. The usual system is to approach the held sheep 
from the left side, and with the right hand over the back of 
the head, part the lips with the first and second fingers 
to determine the age; then look it full in the face, noting 
the proportions, dimensions and features of the head, 
after which span the neck with the thumb and forefinger 
of each hand to find out its fullness and from this its 
length and the manner in which it blends into the shoulders. 
The breadth and compactness of the shoulder is felt by 
the right hand, crossways over the top of the shoulder, 
when, without changing this position, the depth of both . 
chest and foreflank can be made out by the left hand,
-P-A-G-E-271
THE TYPES OF SHEEP 251 
first at the point of the brisket, noting, at the same time, 
whether it is full or sharp, then back of the elbow, 
fullness as well as depth at this point being made out. 
The right hand next feels along the spine from the shoulder 
to the dock, to get the straightness and the thickness of 
covering of the back and loin, with the levelness and full- 
ness of the rump. Passing back to the shoulder with both 
hands, measure and feel the width, covering and smooth- 
ness of the shoulders; slipping the hands backward to 
find the spring of forerib, then again the width and 
covering at midrib, the width, as measured between the 
hands, and the thickness, as detected by the thumbs, of 
the loin, the length of the rump, the left hand remaining 
at the margin of the loin, just in front of the hip, while 
the right is carried back to the point of the buttocks. 
After this the width and fullness of the rump and finally 
the depth and fullness of the leg of mutton are measured 
by inclosing it between the thumb and first finger of one or 
both hands. 
269. Examination of the fleece. — The fleece is ex- 
amined by parting it at one of the natural openings to 
ascertain the length and fineness of staple and the condi- 
tion of the fleece and skin. Texture and softness are best 
detected by pressing down upon the fleece with the flat 
hand. The fleece should be opened at at least three 
points; namely, over the heart, at midrib, and on the 
outside of the thigh where it is finest, medium and 
coarsest, respectively. The wooling over the face, legs, 
and belly should be given due consideration, especially in 
breeding classes. 
In judging fine wool sheep, it is customary to set them 
up on ii re ad thus exposing the fleece of the 
belly, arm pits antdgfoin to a better view.

225 pounds and the ewes 150 to 160 pounds. The form 
is distinctly mutton, yet less extreme than in the-case of 
the Southdown. The head is completely wooled over 
with a hood, only the tip of the nose being exposed, which 
is covered with very heavy, dark brown hair; the ears 
are rather stubby, but pointed, and covered on the back

with fine tufts of wool. The head is carried higher and 
more alert than in most other breeds. The fleece is most 
typical of the middle wool class, combining quality with 
quantity, and it is evenly distributed over the body, 
even down to the hoofs. Shropshire fleeces weigh eight

especially about the head, dark skins and scurs are the 
most common causes of criticism of the Shropshire.

comparatively recently, from a Hampshire-Cotswold cross.

  256 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
It is the largest of the Down breeds, the rams weighing 
from 250 pounds to 350 pounds and ‘the ewes 180 pounds 
to 275 pounds. The Oxford is not only heavy, but is large 
in frame and stature. The form is of the most approved 
mutton type, the development of back, loin and hind- 
quarters being especially heavy. The head is longer than 
that of the Shropshire, which the Oxford resembles most,

and there is no hood, the head being wooled only down 
to the line between the eyes, the balance of the face being 
covered with grayish brown hair; the ears are longer and 
finer than those of the Shropshire, and are covered with 
brown hair instead of wool, as are also the legs. The 
fleece is the longest and coarsest of the Down breeds, 
“averaging about 10 % heavier than that of the Shropshire. 
It is sometimes too coarse and open, and may show dark

jected to. : 
273. The Hampshire. — This old breed is characterized 
by its size, 250 pounds for rams, and 185 to 195 pounds for 
ewes, and rugged appearance, indicative of the rapid and 
early growth in the lambs, for which the breed is most noted. 
Hampshires (Fig. 126) are of superior mutton form but are 
big boned, as shown in the head and legs, and they are, 
therefore, prone to coarseness. The head is very typical, 
being wooled only on the forehead and cheeks, while the 
face and ears are covered with very dark brown or black 
hair; the head itself is large and marked by a distinctly 
Roman nose; the ears are also large, carried straight out 
from the head and inclined to lop, if at all coarse. The 
fleece is inferior to that of most of the other Down breeds, 
being short, not dense and fine, nor well distributed, and 
yielding lightly. 
Coarseness in head and ears, especially, and a light fleece 
are just criticisms of some Hampshires. 
274. The Dorset-horn. — This is another one of the old, 
pure English breeds (Fig. 127). The size is medium, rams 
weighing 200 pounds and ewes 160 pounds. The form is 
similar to that of the Shropshire but is less symmetrical. 
The head is characterized by the presence of horns which 
curve forward, closely, in spiral shape; the face and 
ears are covered with fine white hair, although there 
is a foretop of wool. The fleece is medium both as 
to quantity and quality, being short, lacking somewhat 
in density, unusually free from oil, and not evenly dis- 
tributed, showing a tendency to be bare on the belly. 
Average fleeces weigh six to seven pounds. Dorset 
ewes make exceptional mothers, being deep milkers and 
prolific. .

quarters and spring of rib, and a light fleece that is not

275. The Cheviot.—Cheviots have been bred for 
centuries in the Cheviot Hills of the Scotch border, al- 
though outside this district to which they are native they 
have received less consideration than some of the other 
breeds. The Cheviot (Fig. 128) is of medium size, rams 
weighing 200 pounds, ewes 150 pounds; it has a good 
mutton form, although hardly equal to that of the Down 
breeds, and yields an excellent fleece of pure white wool. 
 
-P-A-G-E-279

The head is broad between the eyes, which are very bright 
and alert, the ears are carried erect, and both head and ears, 
as well as legs, are covered with fine white hair, no wool, 
the fleece ending abruptly with a “ ruff ” just back of the 
ears and about the throat. The Cheviot fleece is some- 
what longer and consequently more open than that of the 
Down breeds, classing as half combing, and is snowy white

instead of the heavy gray tinge noticeable in most Down 
fleeces. The clip is light —four and one half to five pounds 
of washed wool. Cheviots dress well and cut a very good 
grade of mutton. They have a very alert carriage. 
Too light a fleece, a form deficient in compactness and a 
timid disposition are sometimes encountered in this breed.

276. The Leicester. — This breed is of greatest his- 
toric importance on account of its having been the object 
of Bakewell’s efforts, and having been the first breed 
improved it was most extensively used in the improvement 
of other breeds. Its early development is reflected in the 
refinement and uniformity of individuals of this breed. 
Leicesters (Fig.129) are the smallest of the three long wool 
breeds, rams weighing 225 to 250 pounds, and ewes 175 
pounds to 200 pounds. Their form is square in outline, 
although of rather high station, and is characterized by a 
peculiar roundness and prominence of the rump, suggestive 
of a torpedo stern. The head is broad and prominent be- 
tween the eyes, tapering toward the muzzle with a slightly 
Roman nose, in spite of the refinement of bone; the ears 
are fine, well poised and, like the face, are covered with short, 
white hair, with an occasional black spot. The expression 
of the Leicester countenance has been described as espe- 
cially “ sheepy.” The fleece is long, having a five to six 
inch staple, very fine, white, falls in ringlets and weighs 
nine to eleven pounds. The hoofs and lips are black. 
Uneven and excessive fattening and bodies bare of 
fleece on the under side are the common deficiencies of this 
breed. Classifications make no distinction between Bake- 
well or English and Border Leicesters, although the latter 
are in the majority. They may be differentiated by the 
white face, free from wool, of the Border Leicester and 
the bluish face and tuft on the head of the English 
Leicester. The Border type is also more rugged looking. 
277. The Lincoln. — Bred originally in the fen country 
of Lincolnshire, where the environment was conducive to 
size, this breed is still, even after the refining influence of 
Leicester crosses, the largest of the sheep breeds (Fig. 130). 
Rams weigh 200 to 250 pounds, and shear an exceptionally
-P-A-G-E-282
  262 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
heavy fleece, weighing fourteen to eighteen pounds, on an 
average. In addition to their scale they have a square, 
massive, mutton form. The head is characterized by a 
tuft of wool on the forehead which is readily distinguish- 
able from the bare forehead of the Leicester and the fore- 
lock of the Cotswold. The face and ears, as well as the 
  Fie. 130.— A Lincoln ram. 
legs below the knees and hocks, are covered with white 
hair. The fleece is the longest of any, not less than eight 
inches in staple, is moderately fine, white, lustrous, and 
unusually sound. A tendency to coarseness of both 
mutton and wool is noticeable in this large breed of sheep. 
278. The Cotswold. — This is a very old breed, native 
 
-P-A-G-E-283

to the Cotswold hills in Gloucestershire, England. The 
original Cotswolds have been much improved in the way 
of a more compact form, greater symmetry, weight, early 
maturity, style and fleece (Fig. 131). Cotswolds areamong 
the largest of the breeds of sheep, weighing 200 to 250 pounds. 
They are upstanding, but of good mutton form, showing 
special strength of back and loin. The head is very

stylishly carried and is characterized by a heavy forelock, 
which falls over the face and eyes; the face and ears are 
covered with white or grayish white hairs. The fleece 
of the Cotswold is in the combing class, being ten inches 
or more in length of staple, open, arranging itself in locks, 
but yields heavily, sixteen to eighteen pounds. It should 
be evenly distributed all over the body except the face.

A coarse texture of mutton and an excess of external 
fat are the objections most commonly raised against repre-

weighing from 100 to 175 pounds, the ewes 80 to 100 pounds. 
Their form is light, angular and lacks symmetry when com- 
pared with that of the mutton breeds. The head is small, 
completely wooled over except at the tip of the nose, and

but very dense and fine, being two and one half inches

The amount of yolk which it contains causes the fleece 
to soil on the surface, giving the ‘‘ Black Topped ”’ effect. 
The Merino’s skin is a most delicate pink. The fleece 
completely covers the sheep from tip to toe, and the normal 
surface area is increased by the skin being thrown into

pounds, and ewes 100 to 150 pounds, and a better mutton 
form, the smoothness of which is enhanced by the almost 
complete absence of wrinkles (Class C). The head may 
be either horned or polled, depending upon the numerous 
subfamilies within the breed. The fleece is not so fine 
and crimpy, nor so rich in yolk as that of the American, 
but the staple is longer and stronger, and the fleece weighs 
from nine to eighteen pounds. 
Rambouillet. This is the largest of the Merinos, and 
combines so much of the fine wool character with size and 
mutton formas to constitute a dual-purpose sheep (Fig. 134). 
Rams weigh 175-0180 pounds and ewes 140 to.160 pounds. 
This sheep is rather upstanding, but has a well-formed 
mutton body. The head is of good size, with a strong 
nose, and usually, though not always, large spiral horns 
in the male, though none in the female. The fleece com- 
pletely covers the sheep as in the case of the other Merinos 
and is fine, dense and white, comparatively free from an 
excess of yolk, has a three-inch staple, and shears from ten 
to fifteen pounds. Evidence of constitution and hardiness 
should be a feature of this breed.

CHAPTER XV 
THE TYPES OF SWINE 
Tue hog (Sus scrofa) is a monogastric, omnivorous 
animal with an especial predisposition to obesity and a 
propensity for making extremely rapid gains in weight. 
Unlike the ruminant, the hog is ill adapted to the consump- 
tion of rough foodstuffs but requires his ration in concen- 
trated form. His scavenger habits render him an indis- 
pensable party to the great industry of marketing corn 
through cattle, as it is practiced throughout the middle 
western United States, and he furnishes a most profitable 
outlet for the dairy by-products of the eastern United 
States and southeastern Canada. 
Types. There are two distinct types of swine, fat and 
bacon, each directly opposed to the other in the character 
of their products, their ration requirements and, conse- 
quently, in their forms. 
Tue Far Hoa 
There is no more efficient means of transforming corn, 
the staple crop of the American farmer, into lard and a fat, 
energizing meat upon which the great masses of laboring 
people depend, than the fat hog. 
280. Production. — The fat or lard hog supplies fresh 
pork for roasts and chops from his ribs and loin, cured 
pork products, as hams, shoulders, and bacon sides, lard, 
271
-P-A-G-E-292
  272 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
and such odd products as sausage, scrapple, head cheese, 
and pickled feet. On account of the lard rendered, and the 
fact that so much of the carcass is demanded in the cured 
state, there is greater uniformity in the relative values of 
the different parts of the carcasses of hogs than of cattle 
or sheep. The carcass is also more completely utilized 
for higher priced products, and dressing about 80 % 
of the live weight, the butcher is enabled to pay a higher 
proportionate price to the producer than he pays for beef 
and mutton and still sell, at a profit, for a lower price to 
the consumer. There is also less discrimination in the 
matter of quality in hog carcasses. Weight really has 
more to do with the grading of hog carcasses than have 
texture or color. The weights most desired range from 
200-400 pounds according to the class of carcass the hog 
will dress out. 
The divisions of the carcass are essential for the hog 
judge to know (Fig. 135). 
281. The hog carcass cuts.— The simplest division 
of the hog carcass makes four general sections of it first, 
the hams, the middle piece, the shoulders and the head. 
Then each is further subdivided after being split in half. 
282. The hams are separated from the rest of the car- 
cass a short distance in front of the point of the hips and 
are afterward trimmed more or less. 
283. The middle piece, extending from the hams to 
the shoulders, includes the pork loin, with tenderloin, 
from which chops and roasts of fresh pork are taken, 
the side, from which the bacon strip and sparerib comes, 
and the fat back. 
284. The shoulder, separated from the middle between 
fourth and fifth ribs, embraces the picnic or California 
ham, consisting, more in detail, of the picnic butt and

hock, and the shoulder butt, composed of the Boston butt 
and the clear plate. 
The head piece furnishes the meat for sausage, head 
cheese and scrapple. 
285. Lard is yielded by the fat back, the clear plate, 
the leaf lard or internal fat and the trimmings, amounting 
in all to from one tenth to one third of the weight of the 
carcass. 
Hogs dress from 73 to 89 %.

type that is also characteristic of the beef steer and the

mutton wether (Fig. 136). It is a low, broad, deep form, 
that is productive of greatest weight in a given compass, 
earliest maturity, the most rapid fattening in the feeder, the 
highest dressing percentage, and the best yielding carcass. 
287. Conformation (Fig. 137).— The head of the lard hog, 
like that of all other block animals, is short, broad and deep, 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
    THE TYPES OF SWINE 275 
the snout being comparatively short, with breadth marked 
particularly between the eyes and depth through the jowl ; 
the eyes large, the eye of the hog being naturally small 
and deep set; the ears of medium size, pointed and thin, 
carried well up, not lopped, although these features involve 
to a large extent the breed of the hog, and close set at 
the poll; the jowl, the region of the lower jaw, full and 
deep, blending well with the lower part of the neck, 
but trim, giving no evidence of being pendant or flabby ; 
the neck hardly definable, it really constituting only the

union of the head with the body, and consisting of but two 
dimensions, width and depth, without appreciable length, 
as far as such a thing is possible in an animal structure; 
the top line making a sharp curve upward from the poll 
to the top of the shoulders, while the jowl is continued 
into the point of the shoulder and the brisket; the so- 
called shoulder vein, the thickest part where the neck 
blends into the shoulder, especially full; the shoulders 
not having greater width than is carried throughout the 
rest of the hog, but broad and compact on top, well laid in 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  276 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
and smooth on the sides, indicating fine bone, thickly 
covered; the chest deep, wide, full on the floor and at 
the breast, with no constriction just back of the shoulders 
nor between and behind the forelegs; the back broad, 
flat and thickly covered, carrying a maximum of lard and 
meat and well supported with a slight arch; sides as long 
and deep as is consistent with width, the primary essential 
in the lard hog. Since side meat makes bacon, and the 
better grade is from the upper part of the side, length is 
more important than depth, although as much depth of 
side as possible, so long as it comes from length of rib 
and not from the weight of the contents of the abdomen, 
is desirable. Another indication of side meat of the right 
sort is the smoothness, the absence of wrinkles and creases, 
and the firm, rather than flabby, appearance. If the 
back is broad and the rib is well arched the side will be 
more or less at right angles with the back and will carry well 
out to the line established by the shoulder in front and 
the ham behind. If the back is narrow and the rib. flat, 
there will be no sharp demarcation between the back 
and the side ; the side will be deep but pendant and the hog 
will fall away directly behind the shoulders and con- 
tinue narrow to the hindquarters. The loin should 
conform to the back, already described, in being broad 
and thickly covered, the flank deep and full enough to 
make the side carry out evenly and the under line straight ; 
the rump broad, long and as level as possible, there 
always being some droop of the rump corresponding 
to the sharp curve at the top of the neck which is followed 
more or less by the whole top line. The maximum weight 
in the hams, the most valuable part of the hog carcass, is 
secured by the breadth of rump being continued down into 
the thighs as deeply as possible toward the hocks and ampli- 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  THE TYPES OF SWINE 277 
fied by a fullness which makes them rounded out behind 
and to both inside and outside. They should, however, 
be firm and show development of muscle, rather than com- 
posed largely of fat, which makes them soft and flabby 
and requires extensive trimming before they can be 
cured. The essential thing, so far as the legs of the fat 
hog are concerned, is that they shall be sufficiently straight 
and strong to carry its weight through the feeding period 
and finally to the shambles. This latter formerly meant 
much more than now, as hogs were at one time driven 
over land considerable distances, while the trip from the 
farm to the car and from the car to the slaughter is 
comparatively short now. This matter of legs is of 
much greater importance in breeding animals, but it is 
nevertheless essential that market hogs should stand well 
up on their toes. Broken down pasterns, knock or buck 
knees and crooked hocks are the common defects in the 
conformation of the legs. 
288. Quality in hogs influences both the texture of the 
carcass and the dressing percentage. It is indicated by 
the size and shape of the head and ears, the smoothness 
of the shoulders, the character of the bone in the cannons 
and joints, the amount, texture and course of the hair, 
the trimness of the jowl and the under line, and the general 
refinement of the hog throughout. 
289. Condition. — Most hogs are marketed at weights 
which make them less mature at slaughter time than the 
majority of cattle are. They are, therefore, fattening as 
they grow, which is equally true of cattle only in the case 
of baby beeves. Condition, comparatively speaking, is of 
less degree, so far as actual ripeness is concerned, although 
a thin hog is, in reality, fatter than a finished steer because 
it is more his nature to be so. Furthermore, for the same
-P-A-G-E-298
    278 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
reason, the butcher hog is less apt to be overdone than 
the butcher steer. Show hogs do manifest an overripe 
condition sometimes by “ slipping ” just back of the shoul- 
ders, having their sides break in folds, wrinkles or creases, 
or their flesh become too hard or too soft. 
290. Feeding hogs. — On account of the prolificacy 
of the sow, the rapid growth and early marketing age of 
the pigs, and the danger of cholera involved in shipping 
hogs about, there is no such thing on the market as a 
feeding hog. The feeders of hogs either breed their own 
or secure them in their immediate vicinity. Since hogs, 
as a class, make so much greater proportionate gains on a 
unit of feed consumed than cattle or sheep do, less 
consideration is given to the type fed. There is, however, 
a great difference in the economy with which gains are 
made in the different individuals, as well as in the character 
of the carcass when finished. The type that feeds best is 
of the same general form that is required by the butcher, 
namely, low, wide and deep, early, rapid and economic 
production being as closely correlated with this form 
as are desirable killing qualities. The feeding hog should 
also possess quality to insure against growing a wasteful 
carcass, although he should not appear trim, but should 
show his feeding capacity by being habitually full; con- 
stitution, as evidenced by a deep and full forerib; and a 
feeding temperament. A leggy, long-headed, narrow, 
flat-sided, light-hammed and wild-eyed hog will be unprofit- 
able both to his feeder in the making and to the butcher 
when he is finally finished. 
Tue Bacon Hoa 
The entire dressed carcass of this hog is cured into bacon 
which, therefore, is the sole product of hogs of this type. 
   
-P-A-G-E-299
  
THE TYPES OF SWINE 279 
In this they differ materially from the fat or lard hogs 
whose carcasses yield fresh pork, lard and cured meat, 
one portion of the latter being bacon. This lard hog 
bacon, however, must be considered as a by-product of 
pork and lard production. It consists only of the lower 
two thirds of the side, between the shoulders and hams 
and below the limit of the fresh cuts from the back and 
loin; and being cut from a hog that has been bred and 
fed for lard the side is too soft and coarse grained to rank 
with true bacon. é 
291.. Production. — The carcass of the bacon hog is 
split into two Wiltshire sides which are cured entire 
and are then all cut up for bacon. There is, however, a 
difference in the grade of bacon derived from the different 
regions of the side, that cut from the upper part and 
center of the strip being superior to that at the lower 
part and ends. 
Merit in a Wiltshire side is determined by weight, 
160-200 pounds; shape, — long and trim with maximum 
development along the back from shoulders to gammons, 
where the highest priced cuts of bacon are taken; con- 
sistence, which should be firm, not soft or flabby; texture 
of lean, which is finer than in any other pork product ; 
and fat, only enough to show a uniform margin one to one 
and a half inches wide along the back bone. Such a side 
can be produced only in a hog of the correct type. 
292. Type. — The bacon type is characterized by length, 
and all that is correlated with it, 7.¢. length of side pri- 
marily, with a long snout, long legs, a narrow, trim body 
and especially light fore and hind quarters (Fig. 138). 
298. Conformation. — Being a longer, narrower hog 
all over, the head of the bacon hog is characterized by 
greater length, less width and depth, making it more
-P-A-G-E-300
  280 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
tapering to the snout, lighter and neater in the jowl, with 
a fine and usually upright ear. The neck is much better 
defined than in the lard hog, being level on top, showing 
none of the arch from the pole to the top of the shoulders, 
characteristic of the lard hog, and no marked fullness of 
shoulder vein, but just an even thickness of medium 
length. The shoulders are light, comparatively straight, 
lengthening the back, and shortening the distance from 
yi oc cree

the shoulder forward, neither sharp nor open but compact 
on top and especially smooth on account of their being 
of equal width and well blended with the back. The back 
may be considered the foundation of the sides, therefore 
its most desirable features are those which are conducive 
to a most acceptable side, 7.e. as great length as can be had 
and still be carried up well with just a suggestion of an 
arch, width sufficient to insure ample abdominal capacity 
and a meaty side, yet not wide enough to predispose to a 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
THE TYPES OF SWINE 281 
short or fat side as in the case of the lard hog, where width 
is a primary essential. The law of correlation is in no 
place more manifest than in the distinctions between a 
lard and a bacon hog. The rib has a peculiar turn which 
is responsible for the shape of back and side by which the 
bacon hog is characterized. It arches abruptly a short 
distance from the vertebral column, which it leaves at a 
right angle, and then continues straight in its course 
throughout the depth of the side, the lower end incurving 
again to the sternum or breast bone in such a way as to 
insure the greatest capacity of chest for the width of the 
hog. The result is a relatively flat back except as it is 
rounded by the depth of flesh, and a straight, deep side. 
The loin should have breadth proportionate to that of 
the back forward and the rump in the rear, there being 
a tendency in some bacon hogs to lose width at the loin; 
strength sufficient to make the loin the crown of the arch 
of the top line, and a flank only so deep and full as to 
carry out the straightness of the side. The rump desired 
is long, comparatively level, carrying throughout the hind- 
quarters the uniform width of the shoulders, back and 
loin having a rounded contour from side to side, and con- 
tinued into deep, comparatively thick but smooth and 
tapering gammons. The shoulders, back, sides, loin and 
hindquarters should be covered with uniformly thick, 
smooth, firm flesh. There is naturally a well-marked 
correlation between bone and muscle, and since bacon 
consists more essentially of muscle than of lard, the bacon 
hog is naturally heavier boned than the lard hog. Quality 
of hair and flesh also being characteristic of the bacon 
hog, the bone should be smooth and clean, though ample. 
The extra length of legs which goes with the long body 
makes it especially important that they be straight, but
-P-A-G-E-302
  282 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
the broken-down pasterns and cramped hocks are not 
as common as in the much heavier bodied and lighter 
boned lard hog. 
294. Quality. — General refinement is usually more 
marked in hogs of bacon type, although their bone is 
naturally heavier. Trimness of jowl and under line, fine 
ears, light, smooth shoulders, tapering hindquarters and 
gammons, with a fine, smooth coat of hair, are indica- 
tive of the best texture of lean and even deposition of fat 
so essential in high class bacon. 
295. Condition. — The determination or description of 
condition in the bacon hog, as in the dairy cow, is a fine 
point. He should not be fat as the lard hog, yet simply 
being half fat does not constitute bacon condition. There 
is in bacon hogs, as in all other fat stock, an optimum state 
which constitutes ripeness, but it is quite different in 
degree of fatness from what constitutes ripeness in lard 
hogs, cattle and sheep. The condition sought in the 
bacon hog is that in which there has been sufficient fat de- 
posited to show the narrow margin along the back when 
the carcass is split, and this fat is of the sort which gives 
firmness to the side, being composed largely of the solid 
palmatin and stearin fats rather than the olein which 
melts at ordinary temperatures. It should be interspersed 
evenly with the lean. There is difficulty in holding this 
condition after the hogs have attained 200 pounds 
weight. 
296. Feeding hogs. — Hogs grown for the production 
of bacon are marketed at such an early age that the 
feeder type concerns the breeder more than any one else. 
Pigs for this purpose should not only conform to the 
correct type but they should have constitutional vigor as 
indicated by a full, though not wide, chest, a bright eye 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
THE TYPES OF SWINE 283 
and a general appearance of thrift. They are of a sort 
that is slower in maturing and fattening than are lard 
hogs, but should give promise of having no difficulty in 
making the required weight of 160 to 200 pounds in six to 
eight months. 
297. The method of inspection. — Hogs of either type 
are rarely handled at all, the eye being depended upon 
almost altogether. Some judges touch the side to deter- 
mine the consistence of the flesh, but even this can usually 
be made out by noting the lay of the hair and the presence 
of wrinkles. 
From in front, the general width, symmetry and 
smoothness, also the character and features of the head, 
and the length, the bone and the direction of the legs can 
be noted; then from the side and above, the length in 
general, the top and under lines, the station, the length 
and the strength of the forelegs, the head in profile, the 
width and smoothness of the shoulders, the breadth and 
covering of the back and the loin, the fullness of the fore- 
rib and flank, the length and levelness of the rump, the 
depth and fullness, or taper, of the hams, or gammons, 
as the case may be, and the straightness and strength of 
the legs are ascertained; from the rear, the. uniformity 
with which the width is carried throughout, more particu- 
larly, the width and smoothness of shoulders, the breadth 
of back, loin and rump, the depth of hindquarters and 
the fullness or taper of the ham or gammon, with the 
length and straightness of the hind legs, receive considera- 
tion. The opinions formed from the one side inspection 
should then be verified by a final look from the other side. 
Throughout this inspection quality, as indicated by the 
amount, the character and the lay of the hair, the fineness 
of the head, the ears, the shoulders, the cannons and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  284 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
joints, the smoothness and evenness of the covering, with 
an absence of wrinkles, creases and folds, and a trim 
under line should be borne in mind. Condition also, as 
manifested by the general degree of fatness, the consist- 
ence and smoothness of the covering, and the trimness of 
jowl and under line, can be determined incident to the 
general inspection.

298. The Berkshire. — The original stock of the Berk- 
shire breed was very old, but it has been modified in both 
color and form to such an extent, by engrafting other 
stocks, as to bring the real origin of the breed within the 
era of general live-stock improvement, which began in 
Great Britain in Bakewell’s time. At that, it was the 
first breed improved, and has been most potent in the im- 
provement of others. 
The typical Berkshire (Fig. 139) represents the early im- 
provement wrought in the breed by an exceptional degree 
of style, character and refinement, as well as in the uni- 
formity with which he possesses merit, as measured by 
feeders’ and packers’ standards. The Berkshire averages 
a little larger than any of the other fat hog breeds, but does 
not attain as great size as the two leading bacon breeds, 
boars: weighing 500 pounds and sows 400 pounds at ma- 
turity. Its form is characterized by more length and 
trimness of body than is usual in breeds of this type, the 
285
-P-A-G-E-306
286 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
latter character being especially noticeable in the hams. 
The head is distinctive, the snout being of medium 
length with only a moderate dish in the face, the ear 
very neat, well shaped, carried erect, and the jowl full 
but not flabby. The color is black with six white points, 
ut the absence of a white point is less objectionable 
than the presence of an irregular white patch on the body. 
  
  
    
Fig. 139.— A Berkshire boar. 
The Berkshire has ample bone of superior quality, straight, 
strong legs, stands well up on his toes, and moves with a 
stylish carriage. He is a show hog from tip to tip. 
The old-fashioned, short, extremely dished face, a 
tendency to be leggy and to show an occasional splash of 
white or a sandy tint on the body are not favored by 
Berkshire breeders. 
299. The Poland China. — This is an American breed 
‘of most composite origin, but selected and bred for pork 
and lard production exclusively. Poland Chinas (Fig. 140)
-P-A-G-E-307
THE BREEDS OF SWINE 287 
are but little smaller than Berkshires and of the same 
color and markings, although readily distinguishable from 
them by their form and head. The shape of the Poland 
China conforms to that of the fat hog in the extreme width 
of body and fullness of shoulders and hams, being most char- 
acteristic, although often secured at a sacrifice of length. 
The head is distinguished by more length of snout, al- 
though it is very fine and tapering, with little, if any,

dish in the face, and an ear that is erect two thirds of the 
way from the knuckle, breaking forward for the last one 
third of its length. The jowl is heavy in accordance with 
that fullness which prevails throughout the make-up of the 
fat hog. Color is black with white points, but there is 
less regularity in the white on the face than in the Berk- 
shire. Poland Chinas show a marked inclination to ma- 
ture early and fatten rapidly. 
A lack of size, and especially of length, too fine bone,
-P-A-G-E-308

and a short, droopy rump, are the criticisms which the 
Poland China breeders are endeavoring to meet. 
300. The Duroc Jersey. — This breed, evolved from 
two parent stocks, the Duroc and the Jersey Red, having 
a local reputation in New York and New Jersey respec- 
tively, has, like most of the other breeds, been molded 
to a uniform type by breeding for a definite purpose, 
which, in this instance, was to meet the requirements of

the corn belt farmer. In size the Duroc Jerseys do not 
differ materially from the Poland Chinas and Chester 
Whites, but they usually possess greater substance than 
the former (Fig. 141). They conform closely to the fat 
hog type in shape, being low, broad and deep, with very 
full, yet smooth, hams and shoulders. The head is of 
medium size, the snout of medium length, the face 
very slightly dished, the ears of medium size and arching
-P-A-G-E-309
  THE BREEDS OF SWINE 289 
gradually forward, the jowl heavy and full, like the hams, 
shoulders and body all through. Color is red, the cherry 
shade preferred, although the best shades grow lighter 
with age. Dark spots are sometimes seen under the belly 
and on the legs and too many are objected to. As a rule 
the bone is especially heavy. 
A general lack of refinement, shown especially in creases 
and wrinkles along the sides, has been charged against 
some individuals of this breed. 
  
    
Fic. 142.— A Chester White boar. 
301. The Chester White.— This breed, largely of 
Yorkshire extraction in the beginning, was formerly con- 
sidered one of the three largestbreéds, but it ranks now 
with the Poland China~and Duroc Jersey in size (Fig. 
142). Its form is characterized by more length than in 
either of the two breeds mentioned and it is not, therefore, 
as uniformly wide, nor as well fille(fin the hams as they are. 
The head is of medium size, the face long but straight,

the ears large, falling gradually forward, sometimes in a 
careless fashion. Color is white, although bluish black 
skin spots are not unusual. The pigment must be con- 
fined to the skin, however, the hair growing from them 
being white, and, even then, too many spots are objec- 
tionable. 
On account of their length many Chester Whites mani- 
fest a tendency to be wide in front and gradually narrow

toward the hindquarters. Coarseness, noticeable espe- 
cially in heavy, lop ears, prominent shoulders, and a 
rough, curly coat of hair, is a fair objection to some 
individuals. 
302. The Hampshire.— This breed, formerly called 
Thin Rind, has been classed as of both fat and bacon 
type, but barrows of this breed have been shown most 
often in fat classes. Typical representatives (Fig. 143) 
weigh somewhat less than those of the other fat breeds
-P-A-G-E-311
    THE BREEDS OF SWINE 291 
and their form is less extreme. In fact, in length and 
width of body and fullness of hams and shoulders they are 
intermediate as to type. The head is somewhat elongated, 
the face straight and tapering, the ears erect. but directed 
forward. Color is the most striking feature of Hamp- 
shire hogs, although it is not fixed by any means. That 
desired is a white belt clearly defined on an otherwise 
black body. The belt is sometimes missing, however, solid

black colors occurring in litters where some of the pigs, like 
the parents, are belted. Quality is usually conspicuous in 
Hampshires, they being smooth and fine. 
303. The Yorkshire.— The Large Improved Yorkshire 
is the only representative of this breed with which Ameri- 
can hog growers are much concerned. This is one of the 
oldest breeds of swine, and earliest references to it indicate 
that it was then, as now, notable for size, boars and even 
sows weighing 1000 pounds (Fig. 144). Yorkshire form

292 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
is strictly bacon, being characterized by length and depth 
of side, balanced by an absence of width and fullness 
throughout, the neck, shoulders and hindquarters being 
thin, light and tapering. The head is of medium length, 
the snout only slightly dished, not turned up, the ears 
large but fine, shapely, well set and carried erect, the jowl 
muscular but firm. Color is white, bluish spots in the 
skin only being permissible but rather objectionable as in

  he case of the Chester White. Quality in bone, hair and 
general refinement is characteristic of this breed. 
A short, under-shot snout, heavy, lop ears, a narrow, 
weak loin, and too much length of leg are the defects most 
commonly noted in this breed. 
304. The Tamworth. — This is also a very old and 
probably pure breed, the original characters of which have 
been perpetuated and modified along the line of bacon

production. After the Yorkshire, this is the largest of the 
breeds. Its form is even more extremely rangy, long 
and narrow than the Yorkshire, with a very light neck, 
jowl and hindquarters (Fig. 145). The head is long and 
tapering, the longest of any breed, the snout straight, 
there being little or no dish in the face, the ears very 
large, but well pointed and thin. Color is cherry red, with 
no spots, but it is inclined to darken rather than grow 
lighter with age. This breed is especially active and strong 
on its legs. 
Extremes of type, too long legs, light hindquarters, 
especially, and too much weight in front, due to excessive 
length of head, prominent shoulders and a coarse coat are 
the exceptions taken to this breed.

-P-A-G-E-317
  CHAPTER XVII 
BREEDING STOCK 
Sates and show classifications both distinguish between 
market and breeding animals. The former are quite 
generally unsexed and command consideration only for 
what they themselves are. Breeding animals, on the 
other hand, have more than an intrinsic worth, they are 
the progenitors of future generations to whom are to be 
transmitted the characters of a numerous ancestry. 
Therefore, breeding animals should not be judged merely 
as individuals, but as representatives of an ancestry 
whose influence will dominate the succeeding generations 
of which they are the progenitors. 
305. In the selection of breeding animals it must be 
borne in mind that they do not represent, in their physical 
make-up, all the characters which they have inherited, nor 
yet all the characters which they are capable of trans- 
mitting. Thus, the failure in the stud of some show- 
ring champions can be accounted for, likewise the superior 
value, as sires, of some individuals, themselves incapable 
of winning most humble honors in the show ring. 
306. The successful sire or dam is the one which will 
produce, regularly, progeny of uniform excellence, true to 
type and possessing constitutional vigor sufficient to in- 
sure their living productive and reproductive lives (Figs. 
146 and 147). :

only is to be considered in show-ring judging. However, 
a superior ancestry may be evidenced by character and 
breediness, manifested in the head and neck especially. 
  
    
Fic. 148.— Sex and breed character in the stallion. 
While it is true that an individual may transmit characters 
which he himself does not manifest and he may fail to
-P-A-G-E-321
  
BREEDING STOCK 301° 
transmit characters which are incorporated in his make-up, 
there is greater likelihood of certain characters, good or 
bad, appearing or not appearing in the offspring, if they 
are or are not present in the parents. Therefore, the type 
  Fig. 149.— Sex and breed character in the bull. 
and individuality desired in the progeny should be well 
marked in the parents. It is one thing to possess merit, 
quite another to transmit it. The force with which the 
characters of one or the other of the parents are impressed
-P-A-G-E-322
302 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
upon their offspring constitutes prepotency, and pre- 
potency, as well as virility, is indicated by strong sex 
character—masculinity in the male and femininity in the 
female. 
308. Masculinity (Figs. 148 and 149).— The evidence 
of masculinity is noted in the forehand or quarter, which 
  
  
      
Fie. 150.— A typical breeding female. 
is especially well developed, the heavy-crested neck, the 
strong-featured countenance, the bold demeanor, and even 
the voice all betokening the sire. It has been amply 
demonstrated, in practice, that the male which is wanting 
in these features, whose head and neck are not markedly 
different from those of the female, is no stock getter at all,
-P-A-G-E-323
  BREEDING STOCK 803 
or else he is a very indifferent breeder, in so far as any pre- 
potency is concerned. 
309. Femininity (Fig. 150) is naturally characterized in 
the opposite manner. It implies, primarily,-a total absence 
of any masculine character. Hence, the forequarters of the 
female are light, fine and undeveloped; the hindquarters, 
on the contrary, are broad, the head is proportionately 
smaller, the expression of the countenance sweeter, and 
the manner more demure. “ Staggy” females are not 
regular nor satisfactory breeders, as a rule, and an extreme 
manifestation of masculine character in the female may 
be associated with hermaphrodism. 
310. Form in breeding animals. — There are special 
features of form in addition to the sex characters which 
may distinguish the male from the female (Fig. 151). It 
is generally conceded that the male animal should be 
larger than the female, although there are many instances 
in nature to contradict this theory. The form of the 
male is more compact, the female, since she is to be host 
to the developing foetus as well as contributing her share 
of the hereditary material, being more roomy and capa- 
cious of middle, longer in back, more open in the flank, 
and broader across the hips and buttock, the latter 
features insuring safe and comparatively easy delivery of 
the young. 
311. Constitution in breeding animals. — Constitution 
is the last word in either production or reproduction. It 
limits the extent to which inherent possibilities may be 
realized. No matter how much speed or power, milki- 
ness or beefiness, horses or cattle are endowed with, they 
cannot perform or produce to the full capacity of their 
endowment unless they have the stamina and constitu- 
tional vigor upon which to base such performance or pro-

duction. It is essential that there should be transmitted, 
in addition to the characters desired, all the constitutional 
vigor that will be required to insure maximum attainment 
along the line of that character. Nothing will impair pro- 
duction nor prohibit reproduction of successive genera- 
tions and the perpetuation of the stock without deterio- 
ration more than weak constitution. Hence, all other

attributes essential in breeding animals may count for 
naught unless associated, in the sire or dam, with a 
strong constitution. 
312. Substance in breeding animals. — Substance is 
more essential than quality in most breeding animals, 
especially the males. It is a serious fault for any stud 
animal to be undersized, or too fine in bone. Ruggedness 
in males is more desirable than extreme finish.

With these exceptions, the judging of breeding classes 
is conducted along the same general lines as described for 
the market and breed types. The beef bull should be the 
masculine personification of the butcher steer, while the 
dairy bull (Fig. 152) should conform, as closely as it is 
possible for a male to do, to the milky form of the dairy 
cow. Most judges even attach importance to the size 
and placing of the rudimentary teats of the dairy bull. 
What is analogous to the crest of the stallion and bull is 
designated the scrag in the ram and the shield in the boar. 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
CHAPTER XVIII 
LIVE-STOCK SHOWS 
Srress has already been laid on the fact that the selec- 
tion of breeding stock is a more important phase of the 
judging of animals than that which is done in the show 
ring. The great, even though lesser, importance of the 
latter should not be underestimated, however. The show 
ring has been a most influential agency in promoting the 
live-stock interests and in improving the class of stock 
bred. 
313. The benefits of the stock show concern two 
classes of people, those who show and those who go. To 
the former, it constitutes the best advertising medium 
available. There is no better means of getting one’s 
stock before those people to whom it is of greatest interest. 
It furnishes, to the exhibitors, also, an excellent oppor- 
tunity to indulge in a most wholesome competition, and 
finally, although of least importance after a full accounting 
is taken, it may be a source of revenue in cash prizes. 
Those who go to the shows in the capacity of spectators 
only, derive merely entertainment in return for their 
admission fee, but there are usually in attendance at the 
shows a great many stock men whose singleness of pur- 
pose is to learn of live stock. To these the show is a 
great exposition of market and breed types; of most 
approved systems of breeding and methods of feeding. 
It affords inspiration to the ambitious stock man, then 
demonstrates the best means of attaining success. This

educational feature is being appreciated more and more 
and is given greater prominence at the leading shows each 
year. In general the show stimulates interest in live stock. 
314. Show classification. — There are two great divi- 
sions of all show classes: Market and Breeding. 
Classification within the market division is made on 
the basis of type, and all entries of a type may be 
further classified as to age, weight, height or sex. 
Breeding classes are provided for each of the recognized 
breeds, each breed group being subclassified as to sex and 
finally on the basis of age for each of the sexes. 
There are usually offered, in addition, special classes for 
get of sire, produce of dam, groups, herds and pens, both 
owned or bred by the exhibitor. Then there are cham- 
pionships decided among the first, and usually the second, 
prize winners in class, and finally a grand championship 
for the winner among champions. 
315. Market division, Horses. — The bases upon which 
market horses are classified and shown have been given 
in connection with the market classes of horses — such 
a variety of classes within specified weights, heights and 
“Performance only to count” or ‘‘ Performance 60%, 
conformation, quality, and manners 40%,” as to make a 
detailed list unnecessary here (Figs. 153 and 154). 
316. Market division, Fat classes. — The fat classes of 
the market division for the breeds and their grades and 
cross-breeds are as follows: 
Cattle. 
Steer, spayed or martin heifer, calved since January 1 
of the second year preceding the year of the show. 
Steer, spayed or martin heifer, one year and under two. 
Steer, spayed or martin heifer, under one year.

MANNER OF SHOWING 
The judge should have a thorough understanding of 
the customary manner of showing the various classes of 
animals. 
323. Horses. — The market classes of horses are shown 
in harness or under saddle, in accordance with their 
  
        
Fic. 159.— Showing in hand. 
specific class requirements. Exception is made in the 
ease of drafters, which, in addition to being shown in 
single, pair, three, four and six horse hitches, are also 
shown to halter. 
Horses in the breeding division are, without exception, 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  LIVE-STOCK SHOWS 319 
shown “in hand” (Fig. 159), either to halter or lead bridle 
in the case of draft and saddle horses, beside or in front of 
a saddle pony if trotters or pacers, and usually on a long 
lounge rein in the hand of a foot runner in the instance of 
Hackneys and Coach horses. It is preferable that horses 
so shown should not be prompted, but the Clydesdale show 
men are about the only ones to evince any regard for this 
preference. Prompting is frequently grossly overdone in 
the showing of draft horses and Hackneys, the voice, whip 
and all sorts of noisy contrivances being resorted to. 
Horses are led from the near side except when shown 
on the long rein, as Hackneys are. Then the horse is run 
up to the rail of the ring with the runner on his left, re- 
versed and brought back with the rein over his back and 
the runner on his right and a little behind him. 
Harness and saddle horses are driven or ridden well 
into the corners of the show ring, in order to make as 
much of the straight-away as possible, and are usually 
called upon to work both ways of the ring for the purpose 
of obviating any deviation in the stride which may be 
due to taking the turns; also to enable the judge to see 
both horses of a pair, or the saddle horse cantering on 
both leads. 
The special requirements of the service under which 
the horse is classed should be borne in mind by the judge. 
Work and station wagon horses should be handy in back- 
ing up to a platform, real or imaginary; runabout horses 
should stand without hitching; and saddle horses should 
stand to be mounted. 
Drafters and saddle horses are shown at the walk, as 
well as at the trot, and the other saddle gaits in the case 
of the latter, while harness horses are rarely, if ever, 
walked. Entries in roadster classes are expected to show
-P-A-G-E-340
  320 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
as much speed as is possible in a small ring, while high 
steppers show at a park gait of eight to twelve miles, 
unless “pace and action ”’ are specified. All horses are 
required to stand in pose either squarely on their feet or 
camped. 
Performance alone may count, or, in addition, confor- 
mation, quality, manners and appointments, proportion- 
ately, as specified in the catalogue. 
324. “ Vetting.’’ — Veterinary examination may be re- 
quired before the horses are shown, a report of which is 
to be furnished to the judge when the class is called, or 
they may be shown subject to disqualification, in case 
they manifest unsoundness in the ring. Unsoundness 
detected or suspected in the show ring by the judge is 
usually referred to the official veterinarian, whose rulings 
are final. Also, measurements and determination of age, 
as in the breeding classes, are settled by the veterinarian 
and the entries qualified or disqualified upon this basis. 
Cattle. Methods and practices differ sufficiently in the 
showing of beef and dairy cattle to warrant separate con- 
sideration of them. 
325. Beef cattle, in the steer and cow classes, are 
shown in halters, unless a particularly unruly one re- 
quires a ring in his nose, while bulls are regularly led by 
a ring in which a strap is snapped. 
The coats of beef cattle receive special preparation. 
Both sexes of those breeds which have a sufficiently long 
and heavy coat, as the Short-horn, Hereford and Galloway, 
together with their pure bred and grade steers, are shown 
rough, 7.e. with the hair washed out and then brushed or 
combed the wrong way or arranged in some fantastic 
design. Showing rough enables a clever show man to 
overcome the appearance of many defects, roughing the
-P-A-G-E-341
  
LIVE-STOCK SHOWS 321 
coat especially where there may be a slack spot, as in the 
crops, while smoothing it down upon or roughing round 
about any undue coarseness or prominence. Angus breed- 
ing cattle, as a rule, are shown smooth while their grade 
steers are usually shown rough if they have enough hair. 
Some beef cattle, especially the smoother coated ones, 
are trimmed about the ears and poll, while the horns are 
generally rubbed and polished to a fine finish. Their 
coats are thoroughly groomed, usually blanketed, their 
switches washed and picked out, egg shampoos and every- 
thing possible being resorted to that might enhance the 
handling quality of the hide and hair. 
Cattle are taught to stand squarely on their feet, a 
careless position often giving the appearance of a low back 
or some other physical defect, while a special pose may 
improve the appearance of certain lines very materially. 
Also, carrying the head to one side or the other may alter 
the handling. They are taught to lead promptly so as to 
make the best appearance when asked to move about. 
Even breeding beef cattle are shown in high condition, 
about as fat as they can be made without being overdone. 
326. Dairy cattle. — Cows are shown in halters, while 
bulls are led with rings in their noses and almost in- 
variably by means of staffs. The coats of dairy cattle of 
both sexes are shown as sleek as they can be made with- 
out removing the secretions. Their heads, ears and tails 
are clipped, horns polished and switches carefully hair 
dressed. 
The too common practice of ‘“ stretching” udders by 
deferred milking is a practice not to be countenanced. 
Dairy cattle are taught to pose in that position which 
shows their lines and features to best advantage. 
Regular trimming of the feet of all cattle is necessary in 
=  
-P-A-G-E-342
  822 LIVE-STOCK JUDGING 
order to enable them to stand well. Too long a toe, for 
instance, will throw an animal down on his dew claws, put- 
ting every joint on a tension and the leg in an unnatural 
position. 
327. Sheep are led by placing the left hand under or 
partly around the neck, with the right tickling the 
tail just enough to induce them to step forward, standing, 
of course, on the left side, the same as in handling any 
other animal. They are held by one hand under the jaw, 
the other free to be passed to the back of the head or to 
the dock, in case it becomes necessary to steady the 
sheep, or to assist, in any other way, keeping him in pose. 
Trimming is the universal practice among shepherds 
and is defended on the ground that there is no deception 
practiced, since none but a most incompetent judge 
would be influenced by the appearance of the clipped 
fleece, while it does have the advantage of greatly improv- 
ing the looks of the sheep while on exhibition. It has 
been suggested by one of our leading authorities ! that it 
is as becoming for sheep to be trimmed as for ‘‘ Men and 
women. to wear their best clothes when going to a party.” 
Some shepherds display great cleverness in the trimming 
of their sheep, overcoming the appearance of a low back 
or a light hindquarter, for instance, in a most ingenious 
way. 
The fleece is washed before trimming, then dried out 
to render it fluffy and bright. Cotted portions may 
be combed out after having been softened with olive 
oil. After the fleece of the sheep has been carefully pre- 
pared for the show ring by washing and trimming it is 
usually protected by a duck blanket, hood and all, in the 
case of those breeds which are wooled on the face. 
1 Kleinheinz, ‘‘ Sheep Management.”
-P-A-G-E-343
  
  LIVE-STOCK SHOWS 323 
Coloring the fleece, while common, is not so generally 
practiced as trimming, and for less satisfactory reasons. 
Ochre is used, and the color is usually yellow, although 
red and even brown are sometimes employed. If the skin 
and fleece of the sheep are in proper condition, their ap- 
pearance is not improved by the addition of any coloring. 
Much time is spent by shepherds in training their sheep 
to stand well while being shown, not only to remain quiet 
and permit of handling by the judge but so as to display 
their good points to greatest advantage. In order to 
stand well their feet must be trimmed and their pasterns 
strong to keep them up on their toes. 
328. Swine. — Since hogs are not taken in hand, but 
merely kept within bounds by means of hurdles or paddles, 
the manner of showing is practiced by the hog himself, 
rather than by the man who has him on exhibition. A 
hog with style will show himself and such a one, of the 
right sort, well fitted, has had about all done for him that 
can be done when he enters the ring. It is customary to 
wash them thoroughly and brush them smooth, oil, and 
even lamp black, in the case of black hogs, being added 
to enhance their sleek appearance.

THE SCALE OF POINTS 
The following scales of ‘points have been furnished by 
the secretaries of those breed associations which have 
adopted them. 
American Saddle Horse 
Snow Rrne Crassirication ApopTep BY THE STOCKHOLDERS 
oF THE AMERICAN SADDLE Horse BREEDERS’ ASSOCIATION, 
AnnvuAL Mestinea, Apri, 1910 
The Saddle horse must be sound, of good conformation, sub- 
stance, finish, style, and shown without artificial appliances, and 
up to carrying at least one hundred and sixty (160) pounds. 
The three-gaited horse should go plain walk, briskly and with 
speed equal to four (4) miles an hour; canter reasonably high and 
gentle; trot, steady, straight and true; action enough to be at- 
tractive; well balanced and with speed equal to twelve (12) miles 
an hour. 
Added to the foregoing the five-gaited horse should go running 
walk, fox trot or slow pace, smoothly and equal to six (6) miles 
an hour; rack easily without being forced, with speed equal to 
twelve (12) miles an hour. Must stand quietly, back readily 
and lead with either foot in a canter from a halt. 
High rate of speed and racing is forbidden. 
High School Gaits are not Saddle Gaits. It is understood that 
an animal which has been educated in high school may inad- 
vertently show a step or two in this school when changing suit. 
Such evidence is not to disqualify a horse, though it is objection- 
able, but any intentional exhibition of high school is prohibited 
and shall disqualify an entry.

desirable . . . 3 
2. Head. — Forehead broad ; face slightly prominent,

Legs. — Short, straight and squarely placed, hind

forearm muscular; bones fine and clean ‘ 
Flesh. — Even and without patchiness S 
Skin. — Of moderate thickness and mellow touch, 
abundantly covered with thick, soft hair (much 
of the thriftiness, feeling properties and value of 
the animal depends on this quality, which is of 
great weight in the grazier’s and butcher’s judg- 
ment. A good ‘‘touch’’ will compensate for some 
deficiencies of form. Nothing can compensate for 
a skin hard and stiff. In raising the skin from 
the body it should have a substantial, soft, flex- 
ible feeling, and when beneath the outspread 
hand it should move easily as though resting on a 
soft, cellular substance, which, however, becomes 
firmer as the animal ripens. A thin, papery skin 
is objectionable, especially in cold climate) 
General appearance. — Elegant, well bred and mas-

Gatioway Carrie — Scorn Carp 
Color — Black, with a brownish tinge. 
Head — Short and wide, with broad forehead and wide nostrils; 
without the slightest symptoms of horns or scurs. 
Eyes — Large and prominent. 
Ear — Moderate in length and broad, pointing forwards and up- 
wards with fringe of long hairs. 
Neck — Moderate in length, clean and filling well into the 
shoulders; the top in a line with the back in a female, and 
in a male naturally rising with age. 
Body — Deep, rounded and symmetrical. 
Shoulders — Fine and straight, moderately wide above; coarse 
shoulder points and sharp or high shoulders are objec- 
tionable. 
Breast — Full and deep. 
Back and rump — Straight. 
Ribs — Deep and well sprung. 
Loin and sirloin — Well filled. 
Hook bones — Not prominent. 
Hindquarters — Long, moderately wide and well filled. 
Flank — Deep and full. 
Thighs — Broad, straight and well let down to hock; rounded 
buttocks are very objectionable.

APPENDIX 351 
Legs — Short and clean, with fine bone. 
Tail — Well set on, and moderately thick. 
Skin — Mellow and moderately thick. 
Hair — Soft and wavy, with mossy undercoat; wiry or curly 
hair is very objectionable. 
The last point is a very important one. Some animals are 
without this thick*mossy covering, which should, in the very 
best hides, have a feeling akin to a sealskin jacket. The great 
advantage of such a covering is obvious. In cold or windy 
weather it has warmth and on wet days will throw off a great 
amount of rain. For the making of fine robes it is a necessity ; 
coarse hair will not wear nearly so well. The defects spécially 
to be guarded against as objectionable are the following:

These defects should be avoided by the careful breeder. It is 
hard to get a herd without some of these faults, but a knowledge 
of what should be shunned will assist in bringing a herd up to a 
good standard of excellence.

35 Points. 
3. Fleshing 
While the body should be well formed, with the full outline 
pleasing to the eye, yet it is the quality and quantity of flesh, 
not fat, which gives value to the carcass. Therefore the 
parts furnishing the high-priced cuts should be fully de- 
veloped. 
The back, loins and legs should be so fleshed as to show a large 
percentage of flesh compared with the other parts of the 
body ; at the same time symmetry must prevail throughout. 
Strong bone in legs conformable with size of body usually goes 
with a large proportion of lean meat to fat in the finished 
carcass. d 
25 Points.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tue following brief sketch of world edu- 
cational ‘development and progress is offered 
with the belief that it may prove of real serv- 
ice to three classes of students and readers. 
The first is a large and a rapidly increasing 
body of young people, now enrolled in short- 
course teachers-training classes in the differ- 
ent states, and where there is neither the 
opportunity nor the inclination to devote 
much time to a study of the history of edu- 
cation. The second is a rather large body of 
actual teachers who have never been afforded 
the opportunity to study the subject, and 
who now desire to read an elementary intro- 
ductory outline for individual information 
and profit, and to have some direction as to 
further reading. The third is the Teachers’ 
Reading Circle, local or state, and for this 
class this little book offers an interesting short 
sketch of the spirit and purpose of our 
educational development, and of the forces 
which have helped to mould our present con-

ceptions of the scope and aim of the edu- 
cational process. Both new teachers, and 
teachers of some experience, will gain a new 
insight into present-day educational aims and 
purposes by a careful reading of this little 
sketch of the development of these aims and 
purposes in the past.

PREFACE 
Tuts sketch is not intended to be a history 
of education. It is rather a brief outline of 
the great educational movements which were 
developed by the processes of civilization. 
The ideals which were approximated in one 
age descended to the next and were enlarged 
by experience and wisdom. It is the hope of 
the writer that a study of the evolution of the 
educational ideal will be not only of interest 
to the reader, but also an incentive to further 
research. 
The author is especially indebted to Dr. 
Elizabeth I. Samuel for assistance in impor- 
tant details.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE 
EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
I 
INTRODUCTION 
_TuE history of education is the history of 
mankind. In the epoch of primitive civiliza- 
tion the manner of life was so simple as to 
preclude all idea of formal knowledge. Neces- 
sity for food and shelter taught the primitive 
man the means and method of supplying his 
natural wants. Repetitions of his successful 
attempts established habits which became to 
him the ideal of life. 
These ideals varied greatly in their con- 
tent, with different people in different climes. 
The necessities of one race were superfluities 
in another, but in each and all, certain essen- 
tial factors in the struggle for material exist- 
ence became the elements of an educational 
ideal. 
The instinct of man to worship the great 
unseen and unknowable power, that controlled 
his external world and visited him in nightly

visions, expressed itself in religious rites, 
which, though crude, were of supreme impor- 
tance in primitive education. Thus the ideal 
of early civilization possessed a twofold 
aspect. The material, which resulted from 
the effort of primeval man to achieve self- 
preservation; and the spiritual, which ex- 
pressed itself in love and worship. This ideal 
was carefully preserved in custom, and was 
handed down from generation to generation 
by oral tradition in story and song. 
With the passing away of tribal life the old 
simplicity was lost, and customs and habits 
became more complex. But the primitive 
mind, so long subjected to the authority of 
the tribal leader, failed to respond to the 
opportunity for greater individual develop- 
ment, and became an inert mass, blindly and 
dully obeying the dictates of a despotic ruler. 
The birthplace of human history was in the 
East. The march of progress has been toward 
the West. New and higher forms of civiliza- 
tion enlarged the content of the educational 
ideal. “The old order changeth, yielding 
place to new,” said King Arthur to his sor- 
-rowing knight, and so it is with the old ideals;

they grow and change, and then reappear in 
new forms adapted to new eras and peoples. 
In order to comprehend the development 
of education among any people it is. necessary. 
‘to understand the process and_ progress. of 
civilization, for education and civilization are 
inseparably connected. 
When the great Northern hordes swept 
over Europe, they completely crushed out the 
old social structure, and, in their disdain of 
the customs of the conquered peoples, con- 
ceived an abhorrence of their culture as well. 
The result was that education received a 
blow that threatened even the existence of 
learning. But when the Teutons had been 
raised out of their barbarism through the 
influence of the Christian Church, there came 
a long and victorious struggle for educational 
development, and the long night of the Dark 
Ages faded away in the dawn of the Renais- 
sance. 
Thus it has ever been: the degree of civili- 
zation sets the standard.for the educational 
ideal, and that in turn becomes a motive for 
social progress and a measure of its change. 
After long stretches of an uncouth and com-

plex civilization, the twentieth century has 
reached its noble ideal of refinement, brother- 
hood, and service. 
It is with this idea of evolutionary develop- 
ment that the following chapters have been 
prepared.

II 
EDUCATION AMONG THE ANCIENTS 
AutHoucH the Chinese have from time 
immemorial been a civilized race, their sys- 
tem of education has been mainly one of 
fixed usage, a kind of petrified tradition. The 
life of the people until recently has been much 
the same as it was three thousand years ago. 
Their habits of thought, manners, and customs 
were all based on the one idea of preserving 
national tradition, and all deviation from this 
principle of stability was looked upon with 
extreme disfavor. 
Outwardly, the people were punctilious in 
the performance of their social duties. Every 
motion and position of the body, in every 
detail of life, was prescribed in a complex sys- 
tem of rules. But inwardly, they were almost 
universally deceitful, untruthful, dishonest, * 
and gross in their pleasures. They had almost 
no religion beyond a veneration for their 
ancestors; their aim was to attain a well- 
ordered conduct rather than a strong, deep
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
morality. They were industrious and thrifty, 
patient and capable of enduring great oppres- 
sion, but when placed in positions of power, 
they became tyrannical and even cruel. The 
whole aim of the educational system was to 
: prepare the individual to fill a place in a fixed 
order of society. There could be but one out-— 
come. Such a national standard precluded 
free development of natural powers. Posi- 
tions of trust and honor in the civil service 
were open to competition. He who learned 
the most received the highest office; hence 
scholarship attained no breadth, but meant 
only ability to pass examinations. 
Although the position of woman was most 
degrading, it was to the care of the mother 
that the early training of the children was left. 
The mother could seldom read or write, and 
her duty consisted mainly in teaching polite- 
ness and obedience. It was the boy of the 
family only who received instruction, and 
although there was no compulsory law, the 
desire to obtain political preferment was 
sufficient to command a regular attendance 
at school. There were no public schoolhouses, 
but instruction was given in a temple, or at
-P-A-G-E-19
EDUCATION AMONG THE ANCIENTS 7 
the home of the schoolmaster, or of some 
wealthy patron. There was no attempt to 
adorn the room; and except the chair and 
table for the teacher, and seats and desks for 
the pupils which they provided for themselves, 
it was almost barren of furniture. 
At the age of six or seven years the boy 
entered school for the first time, and the 
occasion was made one of great ceremony. 
His studies were reading, writing, and the 
rudiments of arithmetic. The method of 
instruction was wholly by rote. No faculty 
save that of memory was cultivated. The 
pupil repeated after the teacher the names of 
the characters in the book which he was about 
to study. When he had caught the pronuncia- 
tion, he studied it aloud; each boy tried to 
make as much noise as possible. There was 
no effort made to interest, or develop, the 
child’s thought; he had simply to learn by 
heart, not an alphabet, but as many of the 
fifty thousand characters as possible. It was 
therefore a strenuous task for a child to learn 
to read his own language. When a whole 
book had been committed to memory, the 
meaning of the words was explained and some
-P-A-G-E-20
8 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
moral lessons were drawn. The same mechan- 
ical method was employed in teaching writing. 
A copy, set by the teacher, was covered with 
tracing-paper, and the pupil followed the 
lines with his brush, until he could write 
without such aid. | 
The discipline was very strict and fear was, 
a strong motive in doing these arduous tasks. 
The great majority of the Chinese never 
went further in their education than the first »— 
elementary stage. Only those who were seek- 
ing government positions passed to the second 
and third stages. There were no high schools, 
but the students received instruction in the 
Chinese classics from men who had taken 
degrees. These students gave many years to 
committing to memory the writings of their 
own authors, and as but few ever passed the 
rigorous tests the honor of acquiring the high- 
est degree was very great, and entitled the 
holder to the highest offices in the country. 
Thus we may say that Chinese education 
was little else than a cultivated “memory; 
“there seemed to be no conception whatever 
of developing the faculties of the individual, 
stability of character being the chief ideal - 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
EDUCATION AMONG THE ANCIENTS 9 
pursued. It was an education based entirely 
on tradition and it produced a non-progres- 
sive people, bound and restricted by conven- 
tional rules. 
In India the chief influence controlling the 
life and education of the peoplé was; as-it-is 
to-day, that of caste. 
Every individwal-was born into one of four 
great castes. The Brahmans constituted the + 
highest caste and to it belonged all the teach- 
ers, priests, and learned men. 
The second in rank was the warrior caste, 
comprising the army and kings. The farmers 
and traders formed the third class, and lowest 
of all the castes and subservient to them was 
the caste of the servants, who received no 
training at all except in politeness. An indi- 
vidual born into one of these castes was 
bound by the laws of society to learn all the 
rules and duties of his own peculiar class. As 
‘each caste received the respect of those below 
it, the Brahmans, being the highest of all, 
were greatly reverenced and enjoyed unusual 
privileges. 
The women and servants received no in-
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
struction whatever, and the system of early 
marriage, involving as it did the dreadful fate 
of child widows, was most degrading. 
The Brahmans had the entire charge of 
education. Each caste was taught by itself 
and instructed mainly in the things peculiar 
to its rank. The teachers deemed it a dis- 
grace to receive a stated salary, but gladly 
received compensation that was bestowed as 
a gift. Their schools were conducted in the 
open air on pleasant days, and under the 
meager shelter of a shed when the weather 
was bad. The boy was sent to school at the 
age of six or seven years. He sat cross-legged 
on the bare ground while his teacher used a 
grass mat. The whole class received instruc- 
tion at the same time. The teacher repeated 
a sentence in a sing-song tone which the 
pupils repeated after him, shouting as loud 
as they could while they swayed their bodies 
back and forth. There were no explanations, 
and instruction was mainly on ceremonial 
usages and morals. The words of Brahma 
constituted a great part of the teaching, and 
the cultivation of the memory was a most 
important feature of the school. The child 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  EDUCATION AMONG .THE ANCIENTS 11 
made slow progress in learning to read, for 
the teacher like all Brahmans was naturally 
indolent, and enjoyed a long nap during the 
afternoon hours. The employment of older 
pupils to assist in the teaching of the younger, 
a feature peculiar to Hindu education, was 
doubtless the origin of the monitorial system 
introduced many centuries later in the schools 
of England. The instruction in arithmetic 
was quite elementary and had reference only 
to the practical uses of everyday life. In 
learning to write the child used his finger~ 
or a stick, and formed the letters in sand; 
later he wrote upon the leaves of the palm 
tree, and finally used ink upon paper. The 
Brahmans were the only caste that. became 
thoroughly educated. They took at least 
twelve years to complete their studies in 
philosophy, literature, astronomy, mathe- 
matics, medicine, and religion. Their knowl- ' 
edge of mathematics was most remarkable, 
and the benefit of their labor in this science 
has come down to the present day. 
The religion of the Hindus was a great 
factor in the educational_life of the people. 
The doctrine of complete.self-renunciation,

and of absorption in the great, pervading, 
‘divine presence made a. naturally contem- 
plative~-peopleinert, dreamy, ~ and~-non- 
progressive. This ideal of crushing out all 
individuality, together with the hampering 
restrictions of the caste*system, produced” a 
“people that were little more than slaves. 
Owing to the fact that Persia lay in the 
pathway of the great Eastern nations, its 
very existence depended on the exercise of 
arms. In this struggle for life the whole tend- 
ency of education was toward preparing the 
youth of the nation for the exigencies of war. 
The nation became a realm of warriors. In 
order to accomplish this, the state was made 
the controlling influence in the education of 
children, and they were subjected to a long 
period of public training. 
Though the status of woman was much 
higher in Persia than in China, or India, she 
received no education whatever, and was kept 
in slavish subordination to her husband. She 
was greatly loved, however, by her children, 
who, until the age of seven, were left to her 
care and training. From early childhood the
-P-A-G-E-25
  EDUCATION AMONG THE ANCIENTS 13 
teaching followed undeviatingly two distinct 
lines: the body was developed by such exer- 
cises as running, riding, gymnastic and mili- 
tary drills, and inured to heat and cold by 
exposure; and the moral nature was trained 
by lessons in virtue. 
The things most to be desired in children 
‘were a never failing courage and high moral 
rectitude. Justice and truth were esteemed 
the most essential factors in an education. 
It was considered a lasting disgrace and shame 
to tell a falsehood or to make an error in 
judgment. 
At the age of seven the boy was sent to a 
public institution and from that period until 
the age of fifty his training was exclusively 
under the care of the state. Intellectual life 
was subordinated entirely to the needs of 
war. Reading and writing were taught to a 
limited extent, but moral and physical per- 
fection were the most sought for ideals. All 
higher branches of knowledge were acquired 
only by the Magi, a most important religious 
class in Persia. So great was the power of 
observation and judgment of these Magi, 
that even the kings were obliged to receive
-P-A-G-E-26
  \ 
14 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
instruction from them, and to consult them 
in the great policies of the state. 
In its demand for warriors, the state sacri- 
ficed too much the rights of the individual. 
It was not until a man reached the age of 
fifty that he could be retired from military 
service; and then he was liable to be chosen 
as an instructor of youth. These teachers 
were supposed to be models of the virtues 
they were required to teach. In such an 
exercise of authority by the state there could 
be no individual development. The ideal 
of the nation was to prepare the people for 
war. This despotic system, though somewhat 
in advance of that prevailing in China and 
India, produced a narrow and a most one- 
sided education. 
Among the nations of the earth there is 
none that has occupied so unique a,place as 
that of the Jews. Very early in its existence, 
when a mere nomadic tribe the patriarchs, or 
chiefs, conceived the notion that the Israelites 
were a select race, a people chosen of God, 
governed by his laws and led by his prophets 
and teachers. With peculiar tenacity, through
-P-A-G-E-27
EDUCATION AMONG THE ANCIENTS 15 
adversity and prosperity, the Hebrews clung 
to this theocratic ideal. They had but one 
end in view, and that was to raise up devout 
servants of the invisible God. This conception 
became the dominant feature of all Jewish 
education; and, though it was biased by racial 
prejudices, it exerted an influence on family 
and national life that spread beyond the nar- 
row limits of Palestine and made the world 
its debtor. 
For the first time in the history of these 
ancient peoples, we find woman held in esteem 
and honor in the home. The family life was 
one of great responsibility. In the primitive 
days there were no public schools; so the chil- 
dren were taught at home. The boys were 
drilled by the father in the rules prescribed 
by the law for the most minute details of 
daily life; and the girls were taught by the 
mother in all the domestic duties; and both 
received instruction in reading and writing, 
It was a sacred duty of the parents to 
teach their children the notable events of the 
national history; and the great yearly feasts 
played no small part in the education of the 
Hebrew child. Dancing and singing were
-P-A-G-E-28
  
16 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
included in the training, but for the purpose 
of aiding in the religious rites and ceremonies. 
Patriotism was extolled as a religious virtue, 
and every male child was carefully instructed 
in all the details of his marvelous past. To be 
obedient and patriotic was to be a true child 
of God. 
Among the Jews, the only semblance of 
caste was the consecration of the tribe of 
Levites, or priests, for ceremonial duties. 
The priests, because of the varied demands 
upon them, were well instructed in matters of 
religion, law, mathematics, and astronomy. 
Early in the national life private schools were 
established, called the schools of the prophets, 
in which were taught law, philosophy, and 
literature. It was due to the influence of 
these schools that Hebrew thought was 
embodied in the historical, prophetic, and 
poetical books which form the basis of the 
Old Testament. 
When the nation was destroyed and civil 
liberty was lost to them forever, the people 
set to work by means of compulsory educa- 
tion to reéstablish themselves. Early in the 
Christian era, the Rabbis insisted that educa-
-P-A-G-E-29
EDUCATION AMONG THE ANCIENTS 17 
tion ought to be obligatory. This is the begin- 
ning of the idea of compulsory attendance at 
school. At six years of age the child was sent 
to a school, limited in numbers to twenty- 
five pupils to a teacher, an assistant being 
employed when the number was greater. 
Here he was taught arithmetic, geometry, 
astronomy, history, reading, writing, and the 
Old Testament. Contrary to the custom of 
other nations they sought to cultivate not 
only the memory but also the understanding, 
explaining with great patience all difficulties 
of pronunciation and subject matter. The 
methods were attractive and the discipline 
was mild, corporal punishment being allowed 
only to a child of eleven or over. 
Though the Jewish race as a people have 
always been very exclusive, narrow and 
selfish, -the~theocratic principle upon which 
their national life and system of education 
was based has much in it to be commended. 
It producéd an active, intelligent people; a 
standard of pure morality; and furnished an 
ideal upon which modern civilization has 
been founded. _
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
The civilization of Egypt goes back to 
remote antiquity. At least two thousand 
years before the Christian era the Egyptians 
had developed a form of civil government, 
and had shown marvelous skill in engineer- 
‘ing, mechanics, and the arts. The wisdom of 
the Egyptians was famed in all lands, and 
scholars came from far and near to study at 
their schools. 
As in India, the people were divided into 
castes. The highest, wealthiest, and most 
important class was that of the priests. Next 
to these were the soldiers, and a third class 
consisted of workers, classified as farmers 
and boatmen; mechanics and tradespeople; 
and common laborers. Below all these, and 
belonging to no caste at all, were the slaves 
who were usually captives of war. The caste 
distinction was not so marked as in India, 
frequently the sons of one household belonged 
to the upper two classes and could therefore 
mingle freely. As a rule, however, unless the 
son was of the nobility, he was expected to 
learn the occupation of his father and to keep 
to his own social position. The priesthood 
formed the great intellectual class, and they
-P-A-G-E-31
EDUCATION AMONG THE ANCIENTS 19 
alone obtained the highest instruction; even 
the king though a member of their caste was 
controlled by his priestly counselors. 
Owing to the peculiarities of the Nile 
Valley it became a matter of necessity to 
understand the science of mathematics and 
engineering. The priests not only established 
and maintained an elaborate ritual service 
in the temples, but also furnished the plans * 
for building reservoirs and granaries; they 
were inspectors of weights and measures, 
historians, judges, and physicians; in short, 
one might say that all the knowledge and wis- 
dom of Egypt was the exclusive property 
of the priesthood. For their services they 
received a large income, and being exempt 
from taxation they became an extremely 
wealthy hierarchy. Having riches and knowl- 
edge at their command they became not only 
the only teachers in the land, but also the 
controlling power in matters of polity. 
Woman was recognized as the mistress of 
the home and was treated with respect. Like 
the later Hebrew woman she was educated 
to some extent, and had the early care and 
training of her children. Much was made of
-P-A-G-E-32
Sy 20 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
religious duties, and children were early 
taught filial obedience, and reverence for the 
priesthood and customs of religion. 
Astrology and the oracles consulted on the 
day of birth determined largely the destiny 
of the child. Light clothing and simple food 
were provided in order that the body might 
be flexible and strong. Both girls and boys 
were taught to read and write; but, beyond 
that, the instruction was very elementary for 
such children as belonged to the lower classes. 
Each male child was expected to become 
skilled in his father’s trade, which was looked 
upon as being hereditary; and though this 
was not always insisted upon, the calling of 
the father became a controlling influence in 
the education of the son. 
Definite, concrete instruction, slightly sug- 
gestive of our modern methods, was given 
in arithmetic. Writing was taught in two 
methods, one for the-common people, and 
another for the priesthood. The papyrus 
plant furnished the material for writing paper. 
For children of a higher rank a more extended 
course was given, including astronomy, 
geometry, mathematics, medicine, music,
-P-A-G-E-33
EDUCATION AMONG THE ANCIENTS 21 
engineering, language, natural science, and 
religion. But it was the priests alone who 
reached the highest attainments. The great 
library at Alexandria and the higher institu- 
tions for learning became justly celebrated. 
There is no doubt that Egyptian culture, 
by its influence on the classical countries, 
paved the way for a broader and better ideal 
of education. But in its own land a man was 
confined to the narrow limits of his parentage, 
and there was no attempt at freedom of in- 
dividual development, the one end and aim 
of education being to support the priesthood. 
Thus such arbitrary limitations as tradi- 
tion, caste, state, religious and priestly influ- 
ence completely controlled the destiny of 
man and he was powerless to emancipaté 
“himself. And we find that in all the aficient 
countries of the East the development of the " 
individual was hampered by external author- 
ity.

EDUCATION OF THE GREEKS 
In Greece, the great source of all Western 
civilization, we see, for the first time in history, 
a conception and standard of life which was 
progressive. As the people grew in importance 
so their ideals of life changed, and their 
methods of education were remodeled to fit 
their enlarged activities. To be of worth 
was the end and aim of Greek education. But 
worth had quite different meanings at differ- 
ent periods of Grecian history; in general, 
however, it meant to have ability to cope 
with the conditions of life. In accordance 
with this idea we find that Greek education 
falls naturally into three divisions: the heroic 
period; the period preceding the rise of phi- 
losophy; and the period following the estab- 
lishment of the philosophic schools. 
In the heroic age, education was very 
simple. The mother trained the girls in 
household arts, the father taught his sons to 
reverence the gods and to throw the spear.
-P-A-G-E-35
  EDUCATION OF THE GREEKS 23 
All education was without books and emi- 
nently practical. The boy learned by contact 
with men in the agora, or camp, what to do, 
and how to do it. He was above all taught 
to be a brave man and a man of action, and to 
cultivate, through intercourse with his supe- 
riors and by experience, good practical judg- 
ment. This was the age in which the heroes 
and heroines of Homeric verse lived, a period 
of great activity and brilliancy. 
_ Greece was naturally divided by numerous 
mountain ranges into many small republics, 
or states. For the most part these were hos- 
tile to one another, and each developed social 
customs and a form of education which was 
best adapted to its own peculiar needs. The 
most typical and in greatest contrast were 
the rival states of Sparta and Athens. 
Very early we find in the history of Greek 
education a twofold ideal, expressed by the 
phrase, “adds «al ayaes, “beautiful and 
good.” In other words there was to be a 
complete and harmonious development of all 
the powers of body and soul. For the body

or the science of the muses, included at a#later 
period all studies that were conducive to 
mental culture. Beauty of mind was as much 
sought after as beauty of body. 
In the two hostile states of Sparta and 
Athens we notice the divergent ways in which 
this educational ideal. was carried out. 
From the outset of its existence Sparta was 
obliged to maintain its dignity of statehood 
by force of arms. It might have been called 
an organized garrison, hence its education 
was wholly of a martial type. Plutarch says 
in regard to Spartan training, that “As for 
learning, they had just what was absolutely 
necessary. All the rest of their education was 
calculated to make them subject to command, 
to endure labor, to fight and to conquer.” 
All children were considered as belonging to 
the state, and at birth were subject to inspec- 
tion. The weak and defective child was 
destroyed, and the healthy and promising 
one was given into the care of its mother and 
nurse until the age of seven. Everything was 
done in the home to develop a sound mind 
in a sound body. Simple and coarse food, 
scanty clothing, plenty of sleep, and open air
-P-A-G-E-37

exercise were the chief aids to physical well- 
being, and habits of silence, respect, and 
obedience were carefully cultivated, especial 
attention being given to reverence for the 
aged. 
When the boy attained the age of seven 
he was placed in a public institution, and for 
the rest of his life was governed by the state. 
He was subjected to the severest discipline 
and most exacting rules of conduct. Intel- 
lectual training received but little attention, © 
and consisted for the most part of music and 
dancing in connection with religious cere- 
monies. As the sole purpose of Spartan edu- 
cation was to develop strong bodies, the time 
was largely spent in gymnastic exercises such 
as running, jumping, wrestling, spear and 
discus throwing. Boys were taught to steal if 
it could be done cleverly; discovery of theft 
was considered worse than the offense. Con- 
sise and judicious speech was cultivated, and 
temperance in appetite and habit was insisted 
upon. 
At thirty the young man was expected to 
marry, but he was still kept under control of 
the state. The girls were given nearly the
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
same physical training as the boys and became 
models of strength, purity, and courage. 
In its desire to attain supremacy among the 
states, Sparta sacrificed all the nobler quali- 
ties of its people to the development of the 
body. 
~YrAthens we perceive an entirely different 
conception of the Greek ideal, the “beautiful 
and good.” Family life was fostered by the 
state and education was a matter of family 
pride. In this education, however, we see the 
girls taking but little part, for women were 
not held in as high esteem as in Sparta; and, 
strange as it may seem, it was the women of 
no character who sought after intellectual 
attainments. 
Education was not made compulsory, but 
if a father neglected to give his boy proper 
training, he could not hold the son responsible 
for his support in old age. Every inducement 
was offered to make the father provide either 
private or public instruction for his child, and 
great public interest was aroused to attain 
high mental proficiency. In addition to this 
every boy was required to learn a business or 
trade. 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  EDUCATION OF THE GREEKS 27 
As in Sparta the first seven years of a child’s 
life were spent in the home; but unlike Sparta, 
the mother, except in the case of the very 
poor, did not have the care of her child, but 
employed a nurse or slave. It is interesting 
to note that Athenian children had toys and 
games similar to those of the children of the 
present day. Much time was given to exercise 
in the open air, and everything was done to 
give the child a strong and supple body. 
At the age of seven the boy was placed 
under the care of a pedagogue, who was his 
constant companion throughout his educa- 
tional life. One of the requisites of the state 
was that every child should be taught to 
swim, as well as toread. To know neither the 
alphabet nor swimming was synonymous with 
ignorance. In accord with the Greek ideal 
of education, two types of schools were estab- 
lished, the one for gymnastic drills called the 
palestra, the other for music and _ literary 
training. Much of the instruction was in the 
open air. In learning to read the child was 
taught the alphabet, and particular emphasis 
was given to the pronunciation of words. The 
Homeric poems were the early reading books,
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
and long sections were required to be copied 
and memorized. From these poems the child 
learned geography, history, and the art of 
composition. They became to him the source 
of all knowledge and inspiration; and through 
them he developed his esthetic nature. 
Music was a most important feature of Greek 
education, not because it was pleasant, but 
because it exerted a powerful influence upon 
the intellect and morals. ‘In union with 
poetry it led the soul to virtue and inspired 
it with courage.” It was regarded as the basis 
of all religious culture. Hand in hand with 
the studies in the music school were the exer- 
cises in the gymnasia. In Sparta they were 
intended to develop strength and endurance, 
but in Athens beauty of body was sought as 
the chief end. The Athenians prized athletic 
ability, but they also realized that the seat of 
power lies, not in the body, but in the mind. 
At the age of fifteen the youth, freed from 
his pedagogue, left the private schools to 
mingle with the men in the agora. He spent 
most of his life in public, and prepared in this 
way to become a full-fledged citizen at the 
age of eighteen. Two years were then given
-P-A-G-E-41
EDUCATION OF THE GREEKS 29 
to military drill, and when successfully accom- 
plished the title Athenian man was bestowed 
upon him, and he entered at once upon all the 
~duties of citizenship. 
It was with such training as this that Greece 
rose to its highest eminence in the age of 
Pericles. It was the atmosphere of Athens 
quite as much as the public schools which 
_ cherished culture and inspired intellectual at- 
tainments. The Greeks were a highly gifted 
people, and the more the freedom of luxury 
brought about laxity of morals and life, the 
more the thinkers felt the necessity of for- 
 mulating their ideas in regard to the science 
of philosophy. A new conception of worth, 
which recognized the individual apart from 
his relation to the state, demanded a read- 
justment of methods of education. As tradi- 
tion waned, people recognized that the man 
of knowledge is the useful man. The men of 
science, the Sophists, came from the schools 
to teach the people. Teaching became a 
business, and science had to meet the polit- 
ical demands of the time. The Sophists be- 
came teachers of eloquence; they emphasized 
the principle of contradiction — refutation —
-P-A-G-E-42
  30 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
and played upon: word-meanings. They 
delighted in catch-questions. Opposed to this 
kind of false rhetoric was Socrates, the first 
great land-mark in this transitional period. 
He was a man born of humble parentage, but 
his name and fame have lingered wherever 
human culture has existed. His strong per- 
sonality and great desire to help his fellow 
citizens soon made him more popular than 
the brilliant Sophists. His immediate aim 
was to attain clear ideas, or concepts, in order 
through that knowledge to attain the per- 
fect life. The revolution in thought which 
he instituted consisted in the introspective 
method he employed. He possessed a genius 
for questioning, and he questioned everybody. 
With him conversation became an art and 
dialogue a method. He insisted upon arousing 
the self-activity of the individual, of chang- 
ing the subject matter from things to ideas. 
To “Know thyself,” he declared, was the 
business of every one. And he attempted to 
gain through this scientific insight sure prin- 
ciples for the ethical conduct of life. 
His truest and most intelligent disciple was 
Plato. Like Socrates his teaching was in
-P-A-G-E-43
  EDUCATION OF THE GREEKS 31 
the form of dialogue, which gave free play 
to his imagination. In his great work, The 
Republic, he outlined his scheme of educa- 
tion. His fundamental principle was that 
each individual should devote his life to that 
which he was best fitted by nature to do. 
The widest freedom was given to the expres- 
sion of individuality. Here is found the germ 
of what in later days we call a “liberal educa- 
tion.” Plato was far in advance of his time 
in regard to the education of women. Accord- 
ing to his ideals there would arise an aristoc- 
_ racy in education which was to be conducted 
"py the state. There was to be an absence 
of family life and all individual affection was 
to be ruled out. The whole system was of a 
socialistic nature, which developed philos- 
ophers whose interest was centered in an in- 
visible world rather than an-actual one. To 
be intellectual was the chief aim of life, for 
Plato said, “If the mind be educated it will 
take care of the body, for the good soul im- 
proves the body, and not the good body the 
soul.” 
By far the greatest man of his time was 
Aristotle, whom Karl Schmidt calls an “‘intel-

2” lectual Alexander.” He was the most pro- 
found and comprehensive thinker of his age, 
and of them all has had the greatest influence 
on modern educational thought. He based all 
his system upon a knowledge of the individual. 
His method was analytical, objective, and 
scientific. He was the greatest systematizer 
the world has ever known. He taught that 
the child must be subjected to reasonable 
discipline and its body developed with care; 
that its intellectual powers must be trained in 
every way; that instruction and good habits 
should go hand in hand; that self-control, 
truthfulness, and strength of character should 
be an important aim in the development of 
the child. In his method of instruction Aris- 
totle set forth the necessity‘of proceeding from 
the known to the unknown, from the concrete 
to the abstract. He believed that instruction 
should be: pleasant, and that self -activity 
should be stimulated. 
Although these great men did not appar- 
ently have much influence upon Greece at the 
time, their work did eventually undermine the 
strength of the old systems and the old ideals. 
The philosophic schools which sprang up
-P-A-G-E-45

everywhere exerted a world-wide influence. 
In teaching that true education means _a 
harmonious codperation of all the powers of 
man the Greeks builded better than they 
knew.

ROMAN EDUCATION 
Wate Greece was still at the height of 
its brilliant philosophical thought, Rome was 
just emerging from its first period of educa- 
tional life,—a period which corresponded more 
to the rude warlike temper of the men of 
Sparta rather than the refined esthetic cul- 
ture of the men of Athens. Though Roman 
education was eminently practical, civic, and 
moral, its intellectual outlook was very nar- 
‘ow. All instruction was given in the family, 
or gained from public life. There was no need 
for schools, for the one end in view was to 
train men to be active; to be conquerors in 
war; wise and statesmanlike in politics; and 
to have great reverence for the gods. 
The home life was sufficient for such train- 
ing, for the mother was a model of purity, 
strength, and courage. The name, “Roman 
matron,” was a synonym for all that was 
grand and noble in the days of ancient Rome. 
Equal in rank and education with her hus-

band, she was highly esteemed by him and 
treated with great honor and respect. The 
authority of the father over his children was 
limited only by death. When his child was 
born, he had the right, if he so desired, to 
deprive it of life; but, having once accepted 
the infant as a member of his family, he con- 
sidered it a sacred obligation to fulfill his duty 
as a father by giving the child the most careful 
training. During the first seven years of his 
life the child was taught by his mother. The 
utmost care was bestowed upon his speech; 
purity of language, including correct pro- 
nunciation and clear enunciation, was insisted 
upon. In the family strict obedience and filial 
respect were demanded. Surrounded as he 
was by a multitude of deities, the child early . 
learned to live in an atmosphere saturated 
with religious rites. His first instruction was 
in the Twelve Tables, a code of laws that 
every Roman knew by heart and to which he 
swore allegiance. 
The Roman ideals were entirely practical, 
therefining influences of the arts were unrecog- 
nized in the early days of Rome; everything 
tended toward the useful side, even the sacri-
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
fices to the gods were an attempt to placate 
or please them, in the hope of material 
reward. This sense of utility was displayed 
to a remarkable degree in the statesmanlike 
qualities of the citizens. The Romans were 
not poetic by nature as were the brilliant, 
graceful Athenians; neither were they inclined 
to philosophic questioning. They were law- 
givers and orators. 
When Rome through its great conquests 
began to take on a cosmopolitan character, it 
became necessary to enlarge its ideas of edu- 
cation. Greek culture was considered the 
acme of refinement and knowledge; therefore 
it was to Greece that Rome turned for its 
inspiration and teachers. The land was 
flooded with Greek tutors and slaves. It be- 
came the fashion to ape the manners and cus- 
toms of Greece. Mothers employed Greek 
nurses and pedagogues for their children, 
and schools were opened for public instruc- 
tion. These schools, however, were not main- 
tained by the state, but by private individuals, 
and were often kept in a mere shed with the 
barest of furniture. The discipline was most 
severe, and corporal punishment was often
-P-A-G-E-49
  ROMAN EDUCATION 37 
cruel. The instruction was in reading, writing, 
and arithmetic. Reading was taught through 
the alphabet and syllables, and great accu- 
racy in pronunciation was required. In learn- 
ing to write the child used a wax tablet on 
which was an engraved copy. This copy he 
traced with the stylus until he could form the 
letters and words without help. The great 
poems and orations of both Greek and Latin 
authors were read, and long sections were 
copied and committed to memory. This was 
done not so much to extend his knowledge as 
to give a stimulus to oratory. At the age of 
sixteen the:boy assumed the toga of manhood 
and was then required to choose his calling. 
Having once chosen his profession he was 
given every opportunity to perfect himself 
in it both by observation and by practical 
experience. If he selected oratory, then the 
forum and senate became his school-room. It 
was during this period that Rome became 
famous for its great orators. They cared not 
so much for what they said, as for how they 
said it. The greatest orator was considered 
the best educated man. 
While the Latin writers did not discuss to
-P-A-G-E-50
38 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
any great extent theories of education in their 
compositions, we do find here and there scat- 
tered allusions to pedagogical ideals. Among 
these authors the most conspicuous: were 
Cicero, Seneca, and Quintilian. 
Cicero had advanced ideas in regard to 
corporal punishment, which he considered 
should never be administered except as a last 
resort in extreme cases, and even then should 
never be given in anger, and only when both 
teacher and pupil understood the reason and 
necessity for it. He believed that education 
should be a steady growth throughout life. 
“That great care should be taken to make the 
amusements and environments of the child 
such as to elevate and refine, as well as prop- 
erly to develop its powers.” 
In Seneca’s works we read such sentences 
as these, “Who condemns quickly, condemns 
willingly; and who punishes too much, pun- 
ishes improperly.” “The end is attained 
sooner by example than by precept.” “What 
the teacher who instructs us in the sciences 
imparts to us in noble effort and intellectual 
culture is worth more than he receives.” 
Quintilian was not only one of the best
-P-A-G-E-51
ROMAN EDUCATION 39 
Roman teachers, but also an eminent writer 
on educational themes. His great book, 
Institutes of Oratory, though designed espe- 
cially for students of rhetoric, contains in its 
first volume a complete scheme of education 
in general. He deals with many educational 
problems that are of great practical worth 
to-day. For instance, he contends that public 
school education is far superior to private 
instruction; that education should be made 
attractive, and that corporal punishment 
should be abolished; that children of differ- 
ent nations require different treatment; that 
teachers should have marked ability and 
irreproachable character; that education 
should begin early in life and be connected 
with childhood amusements; that as memory 
is most tenacious in childhood, it should be 
used, but with discretion and sympathy on 
the part of the teacher; that reading and 
writing should be taught by a carefully 
graded method; that nothing brightens study 
so much as hope; that a teacher must try to 
strengthen the weak qualities in his pupils 
and to supply what is lacking. 
Unlike the Athenian ideal, a harmonious

development of all the powers of body and 
soul, expressed by the phrase “beautiful and 
good,” the Roman ideal was stated in more 
practical terms, ““Orandum est ut sit mens 
sana in corpore sano,” — a sound mind in a 
sound body. It was not culture that was | 
desired, but efficiency and force. To these 
two great nations, Greece and Rome, the 
world is indebted. to-day for entirely different 
types of educational ideals, which have been 
operative in two distinct methods of instruc- 
tion, the one esthetic, intellectual, and’ clas- 
sical; the other disciplinary, practical, and 
scientific.

CHRISTIANITY AND SCHOLASTICISM 
Wir the advent of Christianity a new type 
of thought was thrust upon the world. The 
old traditions and religions had waned and a 
restless craving for satisfaction and freedom 
took possession of the entire pagan world. 
For centuries the chief ideal of the nations 
had been to develop the best possible man 
for the service of the State. The new doctrine 
which_ Christianity—taught—established— the 
ideal that ‘‘all men are equal” and owe their 
allegiance to God. The more this thought 
forced itself on the minds of the people the 
more their ideas of education were modified. 
Education now meant, not only a training for 
earthly citizenship, but instruction in duties 
for the life to come. 
For many de¢ades the society of Rome and 
Greece had been growing more and more cor- 
rupt and lax. The early Christian Church set 
about with steadfast purpose to reform the 
morals and manners of the time, by setting
-P-A-G-E-54
42 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
an example of purity, and by converting 
these demoralized people to active Christian 
brotherhood. With this high purpose in mind 
education among the Christians turned natu- 
rally into strictly moral efforts. The members 
of the Church were forbidden the excesses 
practiced by the pagan cults, and social cus- 
toms were strictly regulated. The struggle 
was long and terrible; but, gradually, a new 
standard was forced on the population and a 
new era was begun. During all this time but 
little attention was paid to intellectual devel- 
opment. Christian education had to meet 
Christian demands. It was absolutely neces- 
sary that the converts should have some 
instruction in the new doctrines. While the 
children were taught at home in order that 
they might be kept from pagan influence, the 
older students attended catechetical schools. 
Here they studied the Ten Commandments, 
the Lord’s Prayer, Confession of Faith, and 
portions of Scripture. As persecutions ceased, 
Christianity became more popular and Rome 
itself was Christianized; then these schools 
which were under the control of the Bishop 
of the Church became more numerous. The
-P-A-G-E-55
  CHRISTIANITY AND SCHOLASTICISM 43 
finest of these was at Alexandria. This city 
had for many years been the chief seat of 
learning. Scholars flocked to it from all parts 
of the world. It became a matter of necessity 
to broaden for these highly educated converts 
the narrow limits of Church instruction. 
Christian teachers were obliged to defend 
their faith against most skillful opponents, 
hence philosophy, rhetoric, and grammar 
became a part of the curriculum. These 
teachers did not despise Greek philosophy 
and culture. On the contrary they utilized 
it, but instilled into it Christian dogma and 
influence. 
Thus during the Middle Ages the power 
of the Christian Church asserted itself. The 
great hordes of Northern barbarians that 
swépt over the Roman Empire were unable to 
assimilate the vast stores of learning inherited 
from the past, and more and more the Church 
assumed the right and acquired the power to 
conserve knowledge, a task that the State was 
unable to accomplish. In this process, how- 
ever, only that portion of the old intellectual 
life was preserved which could be taken up 
into the dogmas of the Church. Hence vast
-P-A-G-E-56
44 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
amounts of knowledge sank out of sight, and 
a new ideal gradually formed itself in the 
minds of the populace. Paganism had edu- 
cated man for temporal life, it was the duty 
of the Church to educate man for eternal life. 
This other-world tendency developed an 
ascetic spirit and method, and for a long 
period education was bound up with the- 
ology. 
Among the great Church Fathers of the 
medieval times, the master mind was the 
brilliant /Augustine. [He was the great leader 
and educator of the time, but his chief effort 
lay in the formulating of Church doctrine into 
asystem. The spirit of asceticism became the 
moving impulse in the founding of monas- 
teries. For a number of centuries the only 
intellectual life was that of the monastery. 
The ideals of monastic life were always the 
same no matter how varying their methods. 
These ideals were poverty, chastity, and 
obedience. From the seventh to the thir- 
tgenth century there was no education to be 
had outside the monasteries; they possessed 
the libraries and the teachers, but even so 
their instruction was very meager. Reading,
-P-A-G-E-57
  CHRISTIANITY AND SCHOLASTICISM 45 
writing, singing, and calculating the Church‘ 
calendar, except in a few monastic schools, 
comprised the curriculum. Though all their 
teaching was dominated by religious thought, 
as the number of their students increased, 
they were obliged to enlarge the course of 
study to meet the demand for knowledge. 
(The graded system called the Seven Liberal 
Arts came into existence through the monas- 
teries, )This course covered a period o of seven 
_years, and included under the names of tri- 
vium and quadrivium, practically all knowl- 
_edge that had not | been lost through neglect, 
or barbaric ¢ upheaval. This system became 
the basis of instruction fi in all schools for many 
centuries. The Churchmen rejected the study 
‘of pagan literature because they considered 
it pernicious to religious faith, yet it is due 
entirely to the monastic copyists that any 
remnant of the old classics has come down 
tous. The cloister became not only a school- 
room but also the repository of the wonderful 
illuminated missals which were made with 
the most exacting care. 
Parallel with monastic life and schools, two 
other influences were at work during medieval 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  46 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
times: these were the life in the towns, and life 
in the feudal castle. 
During the reign of Charlemagne a tempo- 
rary revival of learning took place. He had 
a great desire for knowledge and called to his 
court many famous scholars. He insisted that 
the cloisters should be opened for the benefit 
of the people, and was the first in history to 
attempt compulsory education. He believed 
in educating women, and encouraged instruc- 
tion among the nobility. He tried, indeed, to 
nationalize education; but his ideas were far 
in advance of his time; and when he died, the 
results of his labors soon faded away. 
Of a wholly different type was the ideal 
of.feudal education in the castle. The knight 
exalted what the clergy despised, and ignored 
what the Church most commended. Knight- 
hood embraced in instruction the Seven Free 
Arts, — riding, swimming, hunting, the use of 
the bow and arrow, tilting, chess-playing, and 
verse-making. In contrast to the ascetic life 
of the cloister knightly training developed 
courage, manliness, and chivalry. Devotion 
to woman became a chief motive of conduct. 
_ The training for knighthood was divided into
-P-A-G-E-59
  CHRISTIANITY AND SCHOLASTICISM 47 
three periods, those of page, squire, and knight. 
It began with the seventh year and terminated 
in imposing religious ceremonies at twenty- 
one. To a knight all the duties of life were his 
obligations to God, his lord, and his lady. 
The only approach to intellectual culture was 
music and poetry. Minstrelsy was a great 
resource during the long winter nights, and 
one of the richest contributions to literature ~ 
during medizeval times was the love songs of 
the Minnesingers. ; 
The sum and substance of knightly ideals 
are given by Cornish in the following extract: 
“Chivalry taught the world the duty of noble 
service willingly rendered, It upheld courage 
and enterprise in obedience to rule; it conse- 
crated military prowess to the service of the 
Church; it glorified the virtues of liberality, 
good faith, unselfishness, and courtesy; and, 
above all, courtesy to women. Chivalry was 
an imperfect discipline; but it was a discipline, 
and one fit for the times.” 
The education of European peoples started 
with Church doctrine, and during these cen- 
turies the attitude of mind had been that 
of unquestioned obedience to authority, but  
-P-A-G-E-60
48 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
now the influence of the Crusades became 
of vast importance. The new knowledge of 
Oriental tradition, the contact with other 
people with their differing habits and customs, 
all tended to increase the concepts of the West- 
ern mind and to expand its reasoning power. 
The religionists began to realize that there was 
a twofold truth bound up in their doctrine, 
the theological and the philosophical; that 
theology is divine science and philosophy is 
secular science, and that the spiritual and 
material worlds are entirely separate. 
This new idea gave rise to a new type of 
education and intellectual life which is termed 
scholasticism. It was an endeavor to har- 
monize reason with faith; to silence through 
argument all doubts and heresies; and to base 
learning on reason and investigation not on 
Church authority. The object of the school- 
men was to systematize knowledge and give 
it a scientific form in the character of de- 
ductive logic. Hence we find that scholastic 
education developed not only a scheme of 
thought, perfected in the most logical man- 
ner, but also a class of men that became 
brilliant dialecticians, keen and subtle in
-P-A-G-E-61
  CHRISTIANITY AND SCHOLASTICISM 49 
their methods. All their syllogistic reasoning 
was based upon the writings of Aristotle and 
it became of prime importance to harmonize 
the ancient philosophy with the doctrines 
of the Christian Church. The controversies 
among the leaders holding different views 
were long and bitter. Realism, nominalism, 
universalism, and conceptualism, had each 
many and powerful adherents. In order to 
become skillful in argument it became neces-, 
sary to have a complete mastery of the science 
of logic. Even in the most elementary of sub- 
jects dialectical arrangement was demanded. 
The child was early submitted to the most 
formal arrangement of text with its multi- 
plicity of divisions and subdivisions, until he 
became completely dazed with the delicate 
distinctions of metaphysical thought. 
But in spite of the great defects of the 
scholastic system, and the ridicule which was 
heaped upon it, it developed a host of great’ 
and subtle thinkers, far in advance of those 
early medieval times. It was unfortunate 
that such brilliant minds should have worked 
in so narrow a circle. The schoolmen made 
no attempt to deal with problems from a
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
pragmatic point of view. All their arguments 
were based on the abstract and intangible, 
and they did not try to correlate the facts 
of experience with philosophy as a science. 
Many of the famous disputations were noth- 
ing more than a juggling with words and with 
technical terms. But while scholasticism, on 
the one hand, developed an unnecessary 
quibbling over trivial questions; on the other 
hand, it developed unusual intellectual ability 
in the disputants. Among these master minds 
was Abélard, who was connected with the 
founding of the University of Paris. His 
dialectical method of teaching attracted 
throngs of students. During his lifetime there 
was a great influx of Arabian learning, and 
the Church again found herself obliged to 
state and defend her position. The great 
number of students who flocked to Bologna 
and Paris for instruction joined together for 
the purpose of investigation and study. 
Universities grew in importance, and acquired 
so much fame and power, that special privi- 
leges were granted by ruling princes to travel- 
ing students. Charters were obtained by the 
teaching bodies which gave their institutions

a degree of permanence. Universities sprang 
up all over Europe, and enthusiasm for learn- 
ing became very great. It was the high water 
mark in the age of scholasticism. But, 
though intellectual activity was very marked, 
the content of knowledge was limited, as the 
ideal of education included only formality of 
speech and development of argument. This 
power to arrange thought, however meager, 
was of the greatest value and influence in later 
years.

THE RENAISSANCE 
From the fourteenth to the seventeenth 
century occurred _an.outburst of intellectual 
life so remarkable that it has been called the 
Renaissance.. A search for the cause of such a 
marvelous flowering will show that, after all, 
it was not so sudden an event as it appears 
to have been. The germs are to be found in 
the dark years of the Middle Ages. Many in- 
fluences had been at work, and the wonderful 
product was but the result of slow and steady 
growth. Goethe says that “Ages of faith are 
always majestic, exercise an elevating influ- 
ence on the mind, and are fruitful of good both 
to contemporaries and to posterity.” “That 
this is true the centuries following will prove. 
After the fall of the Roman Empire, there 
was nothing that brought together the nations 
of Europe as did the great movement of me- 
dieeval times known as the Crusades. This 
movement extended over a period of more 
than two hundred years, and exhibited the
-P-A-G-E-65
THE RENAISSANCE 53 
. most extraordinary contradictions in purpose 
and results. Although good and evil effects 
arose from the Crusades, the great stimulus 
which they gave to awakening the minds of 
those who visited foreign lands was of far- 
reaching importance. The mode of life which 
had prevailed with the rude nations of the 
North, was refined and softened by coming 
into contact with manners superior to their 
own. Ornaments from the East were brought 
to adorn the Western homes, and thus art was 
given a new impulse. 
Architecture became more graceful and 
ornamental, and many Eastern ideas were 
" introduced into the building of homes; they 
were far more comfortable and splendid. The 
lords, who returned from the Crusades, sold 
their estates and built palaces in the cities. 
Artists of all kinds found employment 
in the decoration of these magnificent piles. 
Churches, too, adopted new ideas of archi- - 
tecture and adornment, and the results of the 
immense strides which art made in all its 
phases at that time are still the wonder and 
admiration of the world. 
With the invention of gunpowder the decay 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
54 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
of feudalism began. The humblest peasant 
was now a match for a whole troop of knights 
in armor. With the downfall of feudal power, 
there grew up more organized communities, 
more clearly defined rights, and a general 
enlargement of civil liberty. 
The mariner’s compass gave confidence to 
seamen; and as travel increased, there was a 
demand for more and better ships, and such 
cities as Florence, Venice, and Genoa became 
centers of great wealth and influence. With 
new views of astronomy and of the shape of 
the earth a spirit of adventure was stimulated, 
and new coasts were explored, new continents 
discovered, and nation was brought into con- 
tact with nation. 
With the mind occupied with so great a 
number of subjects, it was but natural that 
prejudice and bigotry should fly away. The 
visits of the Crusaders to the Orient developed 
a taste for Oriental literature; and when 
Constantinople was captured by the Turks, 
the Greek scholars, who were established 
there, fled to Italy and taught their phi- 
losophy. The universities were thronged with 
eager inquirers who studied law, philosophy,
-P-A-G-E-67
THE RENAISSANCE 55 
and science. Poetry and romance, though not 
varying much in kind from that of the pre- 
ceding years, yet became much more inter- 
esting and systematic. The monasteries and 
churches were ransacked to bring out their 
ancient treasure; and the monks received 
universal praise for the labor that they had 
bestowed on their beautifully illuminated 
missals. 
The multiplying of books brought the need 
of greater facility in producing them, and the 
printing -press and movable type were in- 
vented. With these great achievements a new 
era began. Literature was now made acces- 
sible to all, and, with an imagination thus 
awakened, thousands of new words poured 
into the language. Everybody took to study 
and writing. Scholars vied with each other 
in the extent of their passion for culture. 
There was a most intense devotion to the 
classic literature of Greece and Rome. In it 
was found all that was expressive of the best 
in humanity, in nature, and in the life of man. 
The individual in the midst of all this stirring 
activity could no longer fit himself into the per- 
fected system of scholasticism; he demanded
-P-A-G-E-68
56 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
a wider scope of action, and a freer expres- 
sion of his individuality. 
All of these tendencies had a most direct 
bearing upon educational ideals. The transi- 
tion from the formal method of scholastic logic 
to the newer type of learning was slow, and 
was different in its results in the different 
countries. Theory kept far in advance of 
practice, but a foundation was laid for future 
development in thought and religion. 
One of the first countries to feel the revival 
of learning was Italy. Its scholars became in- 
toxicated with enthusiasm for antiquity. Plato 
was placed above Aristotle, and the people 
began to imitate, as in the old Roman days, 
the customs, manners, and speech of the an- 
cient Greeks. The passionate nature of the 
Italian people soon developed in them a pagan 
infidelity, and unfortunately a most shameless 
immorality. 
As a connecting link between the old and 
new thought stood Dante, whose great work, 
the Divine Comedy, gave the Italian language 
a dignity and power that it has never since 
lost. But by far the most important in educa- 
tional influence was Petrarch. He became
-P-A-G-E-69
THE RENAISSANCE 57 
an enthusiast over classic literature, and be- 
lieved that a study of the classics, together 
with that of the Bible and. patristic writings, 
would give broad culture and intellectual 
freedom. Cicero became his great model. He 
was an unceasing worker and had the power 
of inciting others to study. He was bitterly 
opposed to the narrow limitations of the 
schoolmen, and his writings breathed forth 
a new conception of life as a personal, indi- 
vidual thing. He attempted to reproduce the 
classical spirit in his own works both in the 
Italian tongue and in Latin. 
After a time this classical intensity lost 
sight of intellectual freedom and individuality, 
and settled down into a mere study of classic 
literature and languages, termed “the human- 
ities.” With the decay of the larger ideal there , 
grew up a narrower conception of education 
which was called “humanistic.” This form of 
instruction became quite as narrow as that of 
scholasticism. From the first day of a child’s 
attendance at school the aim of his instruc- 
tion was to impart a knowledge of speaking 
and writing the Latin language with Cicero as 
a model. The child was to acquire facility of
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
expression by a prolonged drill of years in the 
Latin grammar, and by exercises in declama- 
tion. Discipline was severe and harsh. For 
most children, education meant only a long 
and laborious drill in a dead language. 
While the people of the South had inter- 
preted the teaching of Petrarch as a plea for 
license, the people of the North had given a - 
far different meaning to the revival of letters. 
License and excess were foreign both to the na- 
ture and to the morals of the German people. 
Petrarch’s doctrine, that the world was 
made for man’s enjoyment, was thought to 
mean that man was not to abuse the good 
things of this world but to consecrate himself 
and his achievements to the glory of God. 
With this idea the study of Greek, Latin, 
and Hebrew was revived and introduced into 
all the large universities. The Bible was 
studied in the original, and the classics were 
printed and given to the people. All emphasis 
arising from the Renaissance movement was 
laid upon a moral and religious reform, which 
culminated in the Reformation. All of the 
great leaders in the North were either social 
or religious reformers.
-P-A-G-E-71
  THE RENAISSANCE 59 
One of the most brilliant of these was 
Erasmus, whose work aimed to reform the 
abuses in Church and society which were 
based on ignorance. Erasmus was a human- 
ist, and though he had been in nearly every 
country of Europe, he had no interest in 
modern languages. Indeed, he said he was 
unable to use any language but Latin, and 
had almost forgotten his mother tongue. He 
was a, Classical scholar at the time when such 
were rare and in great demand. The exceed- 
ing popularity of his writings was something 
unprecedented. In their Latin form they were 
read everywhere by the upper classes and the 
more liberal Churchmen. In the vernacular, 
into which they were soon translated, they 
were distributed throughout the length and 
breadth of Europe, and without doubt paved 
the way for the Reformation, which soon 
occupied the attention of the world. Erasmus 
fully recognized the corruptions in the 
Church and the great need of a revival in 
spiritual things; but he believed this could 
be brought about by the advancement of 
sound learning. He believed that the evils 
of his age were due entirely to ignorance, and
-P-A-G-E-72
  60 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
that people everywhere should be instructed 
and especially should become familiar with 
the Scriptures. He believed in the natural 
sciences only so far as they would help the 
interpretation of the classics. So great was 
his influence that princes, who thirty years 
before would not spend a farthing on the 
education of their sons, had now, every one 
of them, a paid tutor in the family. His influ- 
ence was strongly felt in the educational world. 
He believed that boys had been kept too long 
poring over their Greek and Latin grammars, 
and that they should early make an acquaint- 
ance with authors. For this reason he made 
his own Colloquies models of colloquial Latin. 
In them he dealt with such a variety of sub- 
jects, and made the various personages 
express themselves with such facility, that 
the study of these selections gave a readiness 
to the pupil in speaking and in writing Latin. 
His Adagia was also used as a textbook in 
the schools. He wrote a Dialogue on Pronun- 
ciation, in which he said: “Our children after 
they have grown old almost, under the pres- 
ent race of teachers, return to their homes, 
without being able to call a single tree, fish, 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE RENAISSANCE 61 
or plant, by its right name.” His treatise 
on Study gave rules for the direction of the 
teacher, and showed how to improve the style 
of the pupil. In the paper entitled “Of the 
First Liberal Education of Children,” he 
covered the whole field of education. He 
studied the character of the child, showed how 
to turn its earliest years to good account, and 
recommended attractive methods, and con- 
demned the severe discipline in the schools of 
that time. A short extract from a letter to a 
student will illustrate the kind of advice he 
was likely to give: “Read first the best books 
on the subject which you have in hand. Why 
learn what you will have to unlearn?- Why 
overload your mind with too much food, or 
with poisonous food? The important thing 
for you is not how much you know, but the 
quality of what you know. Divide your day, 
and give to each part of it a special occupa- 
tion. Listen to your lecturer; commit what he 
tells you to memory; write it down if you will, 
but recollect it and make it your own. Never 
work at night; it dulls the brain and hurts 
the health. Remember above all things that 
nothing passes away so rapidly as youth.” 
'
-P-A-G-E-74
62 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
Another educator who came into promi- 
nence in England chiefly through his treatise 
The Schoolmaster was Roger Ascham, at one 
time the tutor of Queen Elizabeth. In this 
book Ascham treats of school-room methods; 
and, according to Dr. Johnson, the book con- 
tains “The best advice that was ever given 
for the study of languages.” He also op- 
posed the cruel discipline of the times, and 
believed that the inflicting of physical pain 
was useless. : 
Among other great teachers whom this 
period produced was Johann Sturm. He was 
a great organizer, and his gymnasium at 
Strasburg exerted a powerful influence for 
many years. His course of study, which 
became the model for classical schools, 
attracted the attention of all countries. It 
provided for a ten years’ curriculum begin- 
ning with the child’s sixth year. Much of this 
time was devoted to the study of Latin. 
Sturm believed that education should have 
for its aim, reverence for religion and the 
Church; a knowledge of the Latin language 
and literature; and ability to use Latin in 
speaking and in writing. The aim was narrow
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE RENAISSANCE 63 
like all other humanistic ideals of the time, 
but it had an element of unity and definite- 
ness. 
The wonderful revival of letters led in the 
end to a bitter conflict with the Church. 
Abuses of the most flagrant kind had crept 
into the monasteries and the court of the 
popes. It was a time of great moral degrada- 
tion. A religious revolutién was inevitable, 
and in the long and bitter struggle a new con- 
ception was given to education. The great 
religious reformers early saw the necessity for 
better education as a factor in the much 
needed moral and social reform of the time. 
The indefatigable labor of Luther soon made 
him great both as an educational leader and 
as a religious reformer. In his writings he 
touched almost every phase of educational 
life. He gradually formulated certain theo- 
ries that are still at the foundation of German 
school systems.“He believed that the State 
should require the compulsory attendance of 
every child at school, and that parents should 
be directly responsible for the training of their 
children. That children should be taught not 
only the regular school subjects, but also 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
practical arts, and in this girls as-well as boys 
should have a part. His scheme of education 
included not only Latin and Greek, but also 
history, mathematics, physical exercises, and 
singing. Children were to respect the teacher, 
and the teacher should be able by training 
and example to command that respect. 
No sooner had the Protestant schools been 
established as a means of social reform, than 
the Roman Catholic Church seized upon ed- 
ucation as a factor in ecclesiastical reform. 
For centuries the Church had had schools, 
but now the order of the Jesuits, organized in 
1540 a.p., came to the front as a great educa- 
tional force and acted as a counter-movement 
to the spread of Protestantism. They estab- 
lished schools everywhere, and their instruc- 
tion was free. The teachers were educational 
experts, and their course of study was exten- 
sive. The work was definitely planned and 
rigidly carried out, and dealt mainly with 
higher education. A constant supervision of 
teachers and pupils resulted in a high stand- 
ard of efficiency. Corporal punishment was 
almost entirely eliminated; and a spirit of 
emulation became the chief incentive to good
-P-A-G-E-77
THE RENAISSANCE } 65 
work and conduct. Their method was largely 
oral, and the amount of actual knowledge 
taught at any one time was small and char- 
acterized by thorough drill. 
In different countries, and in different ways, 
the epoch of the Renaissance and the Refor- 
mation drew to a close; a period which in- 
cluded the Elizabethan reign and the great 
literary outburst of Spenser and Shakespeare. 
It was an era of wonderful progress, a renas- 
cence of the world. Through the study of the 
humanities an impulse was given to later 
reforms. The mind was emancipated and 
popular education was established. School 
systems were perfected and the office of 
teacher dignified. Instruction was made 
attractive, and emulation substituted for 
corporal punishment as an incentive to study. 
Better methods of teaching were adopted; 
and science was given a worthy place in the 
course of study. Thus, in spite of many con- 
flicting forces, there was, throughout this 
entire period, a steady progression in intel- 
lectual, moral, and spiritual development: a 
persistent ideal that of the value of the indi- 
vidual as a factor in social life.
-P-A-G-E-78
  VII 
NEW THEORIES OF EDUCATION 
As the humanists narrowed more and more 
their conception of the value of linguistic 
studies, there arose as a counter-movement a 
different type of individualism. The earlier 
humanists had sought after personal culture 
and achievement through the medium of 
grammatical drill in the classic tongues. The 
later humanists went further and desired a 
knowledge of things, not words, reality as 
exemplified in human life and in human in- 
stitutions. 
The earlier idea of freedom had been buried 
beneath a mass of formalities. To reinstate 
it by dint of earnest study and work was the 
object of Rabelais. He held that a sound body 
and a reverent mind were necessary to the 
freest development. Freedom, not license, 
was his doctrine; he insisted that a study 
should be made of things, not of grammatical 
rules; that all teaching should be done through 
the senses; that natural objects should be
-P-A-G-E-79
  NEW THEORIES OF EDUCATION 67 
used and study made as attractive as possible. 
His scheme of study included physical exer- 
cise, literature, science, morals, and religion. 
He sought development of all the faculties, 
yet in his method he was radical and extreme. 
Of quite a different type was Montaigne, 
who believed that education should prepare 
a man for life in the world. This social 
realism was to be developed by means of 
foreign travel, which would broaden a man’s 
concept of his environment, develop his judg- 
ment, and enable him to fit himself into all 
relations of life both natural and social. Study 
was not to be abandoned, but it was to be 
made a means, not an end. Not so much the 
memory as the observation was to be trained. 
Education was to be pleasant and desirable, 
and such as should enable a man not only to 
be capable in his station of life but also to 
enjoy happiness and some degree of leisure. 
To realize this a man must possess other 
knowledge than that to be obtained from 
books. So Montaigne would have pupils ob- 
tain ideas through contact with men and 
nature. He had great faith in the study of 
history, believing that in such knowledge one 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
68 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
can benefit by the experience of others as 
well as by his own. 
These educational ideals were not accepted 
by the schools, which were addicted to the old 
formal methods of word drill. They objected 
to the new method because it meant a study 
of literature, history, and science in the ver- 
nacular, rather than in the Latin tongue; but 
the ideal of gaining new knowledge through 
contact with objects and nature soon won 
adherents. 
As interest began to be awakened in the 
forces of nature and the new inventions 
resulting from a knowledge of these forces, it 
was seen that all things in the natural world 
are controlled by inexorable laws, and that 
these laws could be applied in education. This 
new conception of education was destined to 
bring about a revolution in method: a method 
which should take account of the natural and 
social development of the child, which should 
substitute sciences for the classics, and 
utilize the mother tongue. Little by little in 
polite society and diplomatic councils Latin 
had given way to the French language; and 
it was becoming a common thing to print
-P-A-G-E-81
NEW THEORIES OF EDUCATION 69 
books in the vernacular rather than in Latin. 
As a matter of fact for the first time educa- 
tion was possible for all classes, rich and poor 
alike, in practice as well as theory. 
The more the new conception grew, the 
more the scientists seized the opportunity to 
develop a kind of universal education for all 
peoples. Among those to give expression to 
their views in writing were Bacon and 
Comenius. 
Although Bacon did not write directly for 
education, his method of acquiring knowledge 
by observation, investigation, and experi- 
mentation, changed completely the old ideas. 
Instead of deducing principles from a general 
truth, he advocated the habit of induction, 
which he claimed was the secret key to all 
nature. In order to be able to interpret nature, 
he declared that the mind must get rid of all 
its prepossessions, “idols” he called them, 
and investigate with patient inquiry. Inves- 
tigation he held should not be a matter of 
speculation, but a definite procedure from 
observed facts, which must be founded on the 
natural sciences. Power over nature was the 
supreme end that Bacon had in view. He
-P-A-G-E-82
% 70 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
foresaw that civilization could not be a 
replica of the past, guided by the rules of 
antiquity, but that it must be a living process, 
a growth upward and outward from the con- 
ditions of the present. “‘Man,” he said, “is 
but the servant and the interpreter of nature; 
what he does and what he knows is only what 
he has observed of nature’s order in fact or in 
thought; beyond this he knows nothing and 
can do nothing. For the chain of causes can- 
not by any force be loosed or broken, nor can 
nature be commanded except by being obeyed. 
And so those twin objects, Human Knowledge 
and Human Power, do really meet in one; 
and it is from ignorance of causes that opera- 
tion fails.” 
The greatest representative of these sense- 
realists was Comenius. Through a long and 
troublous career he gave himself with sacri- 
ficing devotion to the claims of religion and 
education. Knowledge, virtue, and piety 
.were the great aims in his educational ideal. 
His ideas were innumerable and drawn from 
‘every possible source. He was the author 
of the first illustrated textbook, the Orbis 
Pictus, a book which carried out by means of
-P-A-G-E-83
NEW THEORIES OF EDUCATION 71 
pictures of objects the inductive method of 
teaching. He was an apostle of the public 
schools, and he based all his teaching upon 
two great principles: that education should 
be a development of the whole man; and that 
educational methods should follow the order 
of Nature. His scheme included four grades 
of schools, adapted to each period of youth. 
The first, Infancy, or the mother’s school; 
second, Boyhood, or the vernacular public 
school; third, Adolescence, or the Latin 
school; fourth, Youth, the university and 
travel. Inthe mother’s school, which extended 
from infancy to the sixth year, the child was 
taught by the mother practically the rudi- 
ments of all knowledge, by means of the objects 
and experiences of childhood. In the simplest 
sort of way the child was given all the elements 
which he would need in later life. Great stress 
was laid upon the formation of virtuous. and 
reverential habits. In the vernacular school, 
which extended from the sixth to the twelfth 
year, the plan was similar, the instruction 
however, contrary to the prevailing custom, 
was to be given in the mother tongue, and 
had the added element of utility, which was
-P-A-G-E-84
72 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
a foreshadowing of the manual training and 
practical arts schools of to-day. Whatever 
would be of assistance in the future career of 
the child was to be taught him. ‘In the gym- 
nasium, ranging from twelve to eighteen 
years, the boy studied the Seven Liberal Arts , 
_of the Humanists, broadened by studies in > 
natural science, ethics, and religion. The 
university, which continued this course to 
the age of twenty-four, was to be a place in 
which to acquire not only a deeper knowledge 
in all subjects by research, but also to foster 
invention and discovery. All good education, 
he said, demands “good teachers, good books, 
and good methods.” Many of his educational 
axioms have become the underlying principles 
of all good instruction to-day. Here are a few 
of them: — 
(1) In teaching, follow the order of Nature. 
(2) Presentation should precede representa- 
tion. 
(3) Eliminate everything that is useless. 
(4) Teach accurately whatever is taught. 
(5) Proceed from the known to the un- 
known. 
(6) Learn to do by doing.
-P-A-G-E-85
NEW THEORIES OF EDUCATION 73 
These new doctrines were so evolutionary 
in their methods of education that the schools 
were slow to grasp the ideas, and change was 
hardly perceptible. It was the old story of a 
theorist and reformer being far in advance of 
his time. The notion of classic learning and 
training had become imbedded in the human 
mind. Tradition and its established customs 
were difficult to put aside. Innovation met 
a bitter opponent in conservatism. Reason 
could not reject the new scheme, consequently 
it set itself to work to find justification for 
the old one. So in this epoch, while philoso- 
phers, scientists, educators, and intelligent 
people generally had strong leanings toward 
the theory of the new education, in practice 
they clung to the old formal method of the 
classicists, and for this reason; that in educa- 
tion the process of learning was conceived to 
be more important than the thing to be 
learned, hence the old method was a disci- 
pline, which could not be recklessly set aside. 
This disciplinary idea implied the notion that 
the formal severe training in one or two sub- 
jects, thoroughly mastered, rendered the 
individual more capable of mastering any 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
subject or duty of life, and that the control of 
the mind through memory and reason made it 
possible to have power over any circumstance 
of life. The subjects thought to be most 
adapted to this disciplinary practice were 
mathematics, logic, and Latin. So great was 
the power of this notion over the methods of 
education, that even to the present day it is 
found still in practice in many schools under 
able educators. 
During this period John Locke was the 
highest type of the disciplinary conception of 
education. He was in the truest sense a 
philosopher. He developed Bacon’s ideas of 
induction, and "Believed that all truth must 
come to the mind through experience, either 
of the senses, or of the intellect. The mind, 
however, could not grasp truth, or reason 
about it, unless it was properly trained for 
that purpose; this training was only obtain- 
able by severe discipline. Discipline, there- 
fore, with Locke, was considered a very 
necessary means to a large end. |In education 
   three things were to be considered, in this 
order of development: the physical, moral, 
and intellectual nature. The first was most

- 
NEW THEORIES OF EDUCATION 1 
important, because nothing could be accom- 
plished without a sound mind in a sound body; 
and then education was to be along the lines 
of virtue, wisdom, breeding, and learning. 
Although Locke himself was never a school 
teacher, many of his ideas have permeated 
the school systems of to-day. He was a tutor 
in a gentleman’s family, and much of his 
writing had to do with the training of gentle- 
men of leisure. It was because of his fame as 
a philosopher, that his teachings had influ- 
ence upon the ideals of his own and the suc- 
ceeding generation. 
For the strengthening of the body he formu- 
lated rules which were remarkable in hygienic 
thought, and far beyond the practice of the 
time. Children were to be hardened by fre- 
quent cold baths; to live in the open air; to 
wear loose and light clothing; to eat little 
meat and few sweets, but plenty of ripe fruit; 
to go to bed early, and on a hard bed; and to 
have plenty of exercise. ae 
Discipline of the moral nature should 
accompany this discipline of the body. Chil- 
dren should ‘be taught to obey parents at 
once and with willingness; to control temper,
-P-A-G-E-88
  16 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
and passions. Self -control and self - denial 
were to be insisted upon, by pleasant means 
if possible, but never neglected even if severe 
punishment were necessary. Locke strenu- 
ously opposed corporal punishment, but if 
ever undertaken as‘a last resort then it must 
be continued until the child yielded and 
obeyed. A child should be trained in wisdom; 
that is, in whatever would make him of the 
most service in life, and in whatever would 
best fit him to perform such service easily 
and well; such training was to be eminently 
practical. Locke placed the greatest impor- 
- tance upon the matter of good breeding. He 
believed that the forming of character and 
the development of a fine personality were 
far superior to the mere culture of the intel- 
lectual faculties. Great care should be be- 
stowed upon the manners and polite behavior 
of a child, and this should not be taught by 
rules, or by force, but by example, and a 
training of the disposition, leaving the child, 
once well-disposed in his temper, to act natu- 
rally and so permit an individual freedom, 
and develop a personality of his own. Locke 
believed, as others before him had, in the

influence of foreign travel, but differed from 
the prevailing notion as to the time when it 
should be taken. He said it should never be 
permitted during the adolescent or forma- 
tive period of a boy’s life, except under the 
care of a tutor, who should be a true gentle- 
man in every sense of the word. Locke put 
ing, as the last of all in importance. Yet he

by object teaching and conversation. Of the 
fine arts Locke had little appreciation, but he 
included dancing, riding, and fencing as being 
accomplishments that would make a graceful 
carriage and supple body. Above all, the 
child was not to be given a mass of knowledge, 
but was to develop through instruction inde- 
pendence of thought; he was not to be an 
imitator, but a well-trained and individual 
thinker. 
Thus during the seventeenth century the 
tendency, begun during the Renaissance 
period, to break away from the old ideals in 
favor of individual development, was strength- 
ened and broadened. Science and philosophy, 
though working through different types of the 
humanists and realists, had at least in view 
the aim to subordinate the classical studies 
to more practical ones; to use milder forms of 
discipline; to make learning attractive; and 
to recognize in some degree that different 
capacities require different methods of train- 
ing and of instruction.

BACK TO NATURE 
Tue eighteenth century was destined to_be 
the preparatory school for a revolution not 
only in the political world but in the educa- 
tional world as well. The tendencies of the 
times had taken two distinct directions. Fol- 
lowing hard upon the Reformation, the 
Protestant sects had demanded that all reli- 
gious life should be without ritual or cere- 
mony. Religious simplicity in the severest 
and most rugged form was exacted of every 
Protestant believer, not only in Church devo- 
tion, but in the common routine of everyday 
life. Such ideals were incapable of fulfillment 
and a reaction was inevitable. In France, 
contrary to the general response to the 
Reformation, the Church had become auto- 
cratic in power and had resisted all attempts 
to lessen its authority over the minds of the 
people. This, too, was bound to bring about 
a reaction. During the early part of the 
eighteenth century appeared a body of think- 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
ers called “The Illuminati.” These writers 
emphasized the rule of reason as superior to 
that of authority; every man was to have 
freedom of conscience and thought. The 
group became as autocratic in its turn as the 
Church, against which all its bitterest attacks 
were directed, had been. Voltaire, and those 
of his sort, preached a morality that was as 
superficial as it was hypocritical. The French 
court was brilliant, wealthy, and corrupt. 
Society was artificial and formal in the 
extreme. |It'was in the recoil against the cor- 
ruptions and conventionality of society that 
Rousseau made his revolutionary appeal to 
Nature. Although he wrote many books, or 
treatises, in violent opposition to the prevail- 
ing customs of his day, the one book which 
had the most direct and far-reaching influence 
upon education was Emile. The charm of 
this work made a deep impression on the best 
thinkers of Europe. In this book, which is 
part essay and part romance, he expounded 
his doctrine that Nature was to be studied and 
followed. 
Emotional in the extreme, he exhibited the 
greatest diversity of traits in his character.
-P-A-G-E-93
  BACK TO NATURE 81 
Weak, and wild in youth, committing all sorts 
of excesses, he had yet a passionate love for 
Nature in all her moods. In the midst of a 
selfish, materialistic world, this deep, rever- 
ential love for Nature was like a beautiful 
strain of music which captivated the listener. 
While his writings abounded in the most 
extravagant paradoxes, he arrested the atten- 
tion of the time by declaring the right of the 
common peopie to happiness and education. 
This idea became the motif of his writings. 
Society as it then existed could not give the 
common people their birthright, therefore it 
was necessary to get back to Nature and live 
a life untrammeled by artificial forms. /There 
are, he declared, three media by which we 
receive our education: nature, man, and 
things. Over the first, which is the inner 
development of our powers, we have no con- 
trol, but it is in our power to direct the use 
we make of this development and what we 
learn through our environment. 
Starting with the idea that “Everything 
is good as it comes from the hands of the 
Author of Nature; but everything degener- 
ates in the hands of man,” he developed by   
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
successive stages the education of Emile. In 
order to make his theory a plausible one, he 
depicted Emile as a wealthy orphan, strong 
and vigorous. Having no natural guardians, 
he was placed under the care of a tutor remote 
from all society. In this way he was to grow 
up a healthy animal, yielding to no authority 
but that of his own instincts. He was never 
to be forced to do anything he did not wish 
to do, and he was never to receive direct 
teaching of any kind; hence all his education 
was of the most negative character. He was 
not to know the difference between vice and 
virtue, but was constantly to be guarded from 
all evil, and allow nature to develop in him a 
pure character, simply by the absence of all 
contaminating influences. So, too, he was to 
learn from his own experiences those things 
which were wise and good to do; economy 
of time and strength he would learn through 
his own failures, or successes, and not by the 
advice of his tutor. Rousseau believed that a 
large part of the blunders made in teaching 
children arose from the lack of understanding 
the child’s nature; that we expect a man’s 
judgment and appreciation when we have
-P-A-G-E-95
BACK TO NATURE 83 
only a simple undeveloped mind to deal with. 
For this reason he had Emile’s tutor as near 
to his own age as possible. Having surrounded 
Emile with conditions favorable to the unfold- 
ing of his theories, Rousseau proceeded to 
describe the separate stages of Emile’s educa- 
tion. This began at birth and the first period 
extended to the age of five. These years of 
infancy were to be wholly physical, no 
attempt at intellectual or moral training. 
The glory of the country life was extolled, 
Emile was to be freed from all slavery to 
clothes and live in the open air. He was to 
develop, above all else, a perfectly healthy 
body, to have all necessary wants supplied, 
but imaginary wants which might grow into 
habits were to be ignored. In general, his 
theory was that when a child began to speak 
he was to be restrained from learning many 
words until his teacher was reasonably sure 
that he had ideas behind what he was trying 
to express. From five to twelve Emile passed 
through the second stage of his development. 
Tt was practically one of sense-training alone. 
He learned to measure, weigh, and to dis- 
cover general laws wholly by his experiences.
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
All sense of moral responsibility was acquired 
only by stress of circumstances; disobedience 
brought its own natural consequences, there- 
fore his tutor should refrain from any positive 
teaching; but, at the same time, he should 
carefully guard him from all temptation. At 
the age of twelve Emile had received no book 
instruction, but he knew what he talked about 
and had good judgment. Up to this age the 
object had been to lose time mentally for the 
sake of the physical development. Now, with 
a strong body, Emile was expected in the next 
three years to obtain most of his intellectual 
training. Everything, however, was elimi- 
nated except the useful things, and those were 
to be learned through contact with Nature.\ 
The one book he was permitted to use was. 
Robinson Crusoe.\ He also learned a trade, 
—that of a carpenter, —in order that he 
might acquire a respect for industry. At 
fifteen he entered upon an entirely new phase 
of education. Here Rousseau was notably in 
advance of his time in his recognition of the 
adolescent period. For the first time, Emile 
was placed in direct social contact with man, 
and learned to enlarge his feeling of self-love
-P-A-G-E-97
SESS cia a Rs a a a

BACK ‘10 NATURE 85 
until it included that of love for others; his 
moral and religious nature was now to be 
awakened and instructed. 
Rousseau represented Emile at the age of 
twenty as considering the problem of mar- 
riage. Being introduced to Sophie he fell 
violently in love with her; and, after a cer- 
tain period devoted to travel, he married her. 
Thus Emile had been brought to the place 
where he took his place in the world not as 
a citizen, but as a man. 
Rousseau devoted the last section of his 
book Emile exclusively to the education of 
Sophie, and practically summed up all his 
ideas in regard to the education of women. 
His conception of a woman’s education was 
diametrically opposite to that which he gave 
to Emile. A woman, he taught, should be 
educated only to serve and please her hus- 
band. She should be obedient to his com- 
mands, and always agreeable and pleasant. 
She was to be trained in all the household 
arts, and in such dainty occupations as would 
render her more charming. Rousseau thus 
placed woman in a very inferior position, and 
did not at all consider her education in regard 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 THE EDUCATIONAL aie 
to her personal development, but only as the 
companion and servant of man. 
Although Rousseau’s Emile contained many 
extravagant and impractical ideas, the bril- 
liancy of style, together with its unusual 
paradoxes, won for it a large hearing. It was 
translated into many languages, and its 
influence marked a new era in educational 
thought. Many of his ideas were borrowed 
from others; but no one had succeeded be- 
fore in impressing them upon the educational 
world. With the advent of this book new 
methods were formulated and a new concep- 
tion of child-nature was created. For centu- 
ries it had been the practice to treat the child 
as a diminutive man. A man’s knowledge and 
a man’s habits of thought had been thrust 
upon the child’s intellectual nature, even 
when it was impossible for him to respond to 
them. The more repugnant and difficult his 
tasks were to him, the more of disciplinary 
value they were supposed to possess. Rous- 
seau’s doctrines were revolutionary in their 
strenuous opposition to the prevailing methods 
of the time./"The fundamental principles un- 
derlying the education of Emile were those
-P-A-G-E-99
BACK TO NATURE 87 
that the best educators of to-day recognize as 
essential to all true development of the child. 
They are briefly these: education is progres- 
‘sive; just as the physical body with all its 
faculties and powers grows from infancy to 
adult life, so the education of body, mind, 
and soul, must grow in correspondence. As 
the child cannot show feats of skill that pri- 
marily belong to manhood, so he is incapable 
of exercising man’s judgment and power over 
his thought. All life is an insensible but 
gradual growth, a process of developing ac- 
tivities both of body and mind. In the same 
way education should conform to these laws 
of growth, and adapt its methods to the 
different periods of childhood, youth, and 
maturity. 7 
While Rousseau recognized these great 
principles, he oddly enough violated them in 
a very strange way, in setting apart each 
stage of education as a thing by itself, for- 
getting that the transition from childhood to 
youth, and to manhood, though formally set 
apart by length of years, in actual life experi- 
ences no such divisions. The process of growth 
is not separated into groups, with clearly
-P-A-G-E-100
38 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
defined limits, and it is not psychological to 
limit education to certain formal stages. One 
period should easily and imperceptibly pass 
into the next. In order to do this the second 
of Rousseau’s~principles must be followed; 
namely, all education must be natural. The 
truest education does not consist in knowl- 
edge acquired from books, but that which is 
obtained by contact with Nature. Nature, 
with Rousseau, took on several different 
meanings; but, in general, his phrase, “return 
to Nature,” meant a breaking-away: from the 
artificial conventionalities of society, .and 
using the objects and laws of the physical 
world as educational material. Rousseau 
declared he hated books; that greater and 
grander things could be learned by reading 
in the book of Nature. “The child,” he said, 
“is not to learn science, but to discover it.” 
So in all education the methods should be 
simple, and here we come upon Rousseau’s 
third great principle. There had been too 
great a tendency to conceal truth by words, 
to study phenomena, not by observation, but 
by signs. He held. that geography should be 
taught by observation of hills, mountains, 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  BACK TO NATURE 89 
streams, and rivers, not by maps of them; 
botany by study of plants themselves, not by 
descriptions of them; language by conversa- 
tion with a native, not by grammatical rules. 
All these principles depended on a fourth and 
a still greater one, that education, to be true, 
involves a study of child-nature. ) Rousseau 
said in his preface to Emile, ‘We do not know 
childhood. Acting on the false ideas we have 
of it, the farther we go the farther we wander 
from the right path. Those who are wisest 
are attached to what is important for men to 
know, without considering what children are 
able to apprehend... . Begin, then, by 
studying your pupils more thoroughly, for it 
is very certain that you do not know them.” 
Children should be treated as children, not as 
their elders, and in order to do this one should 
have a knowledge of the laws of intellectual 
development. 
No matter how much we deplore the weak- 
ness of Rousseau’s character, we must honor 
him for his wonderful sympathy with Nature, 
with that most marvelous nature of all, that 
of the little child. In spite of the fact that 
Rousseau met with bitter opposition, and that
-P-A-G-E-102
  90 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
many of his theories were wild and false, 
there are few who will not readily acknowledge 
that he was the pioneer in modern education. 
His principles, stated above, have become the 
underlying motif of all instruction as. we know 
_it to-day. ;He labored and we have entered 
into his labors.

PESTALOZZI, AND THE KINDERGARTEN 
ALTHOUGH repeated efforts had been made 
by educators and rulers during the eighteenth 
century to establish public schools for the 
common people, they had achieved but little 
success. The teachers were poorly paid, and 
rarely had any training or capacity for their 
work. Those who could find no employment 
elsewhere took up the occupation of teaching 
as a means of livelihood. The result was that 
attendance at school was very irregular; the 
girls were practically neglected; and the 
common people regarded the public school 
as a burden. 
During this miserable state of affairs 
Pestalozzi came under the influence of the 
naturalistic movement. When he read Rous- 
seau’s Emile, he was completely entranced. 
The ideas of freedom, that he imbibed from 
it, filled him with a great longing to make the 
cause of the common people the object of his 
life-work. With an inexhaustible love for chil-
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
dren he felt no sacrifice was too great for him 
to make, and no obstacle too great for 
him to overcome. He was without money, 
and without talent, but he had a genius for 
hard work, and his emotional temperament 
made him deeply alive to the needs of the 
people. He became an ardent revolutionist; 
and regardless of the dictates of reason and 
prudence he espoused the cause of humanity, 
and insisted_that the little children should 
be trained and educated with love. He was 
in very truth an apostle of the common people 
and the savior of little children. 
At an early age Pestalozzi lost his father 
and was brought up by his mother and her 
faithful servant. Naturally shy and quiet, he 
lived very much alone, and lacked the self- 
reliance and judgment which he so much 
needed. He had little or no taste for learning, 
and was often the object of ridicule among his 
companions, but his kind and obliging heart 
made him greatly beloved. His peculiar tem- 
perament made it difficult for him to settle 
in any profession. He had no faculty for 
earning money, nor judgment in using it. 
But his optimistic heart kept him ever true 
   
-P-A-G-E-105
PESTALOZZI, AND THE KINDERGARTEN 93 
to his ideals in spite of the terrible misfor- 
tunes that heaped themselves upon him. He 
undertook by turns to be a preacher, a law- 
yer, and a farmer; and, finally, when he had 
reduced his family to want by his unsuccess- 
ful enterprises, he opened his home as an 
industrial school for poor children. This, too, 
proved a financial failure, and he took to 
writing on educational themes. The book 
' which brought him into notice, and which 
had the greatest influence on the people of 
his time, was entitled Leonard and Gertrude. 
It was intended to bring about a better under- 
standing of popular education, which he felt 
should begin at home under the direction of 
the mother. This book was followed by others, | 
and after some years he took up the work 
of teaching again, conducting an asylum for 
orphan children, a primary school, and finally 
an institution for secondary education for the 
people of the middle class. But he was pre- 
eminently a teacher of little children; and, 
when he undertook higher education, his 
inferior knowledge hampered his methods 
and his schools soon declined. The world 
admires the brilliant intellect and scholarly

attainments of an Aristotle or Abélard, but 
there is no name among all the great educa- 
tors of the world that is so beloved as that 
of Pestalozzi. It is due to his enthusiastic 
love for the common people, and his unselfish 
devotion to them, that popular anaes re- 
ceived the impulse that guides it to-day. 
His methods were vague and irregular, 
hampered at every turn by his lack of know]- 
edge, but his conception that all education 
must be a growth, and sind every child has a 
right to moral and intellectual development, 
became a vital inspiration to all who came in 
contact with him. He boasted that he had 
not read a book in thirty years. He did not 
attempt to impart much knowledge but to 
develop power in the child. For this reason 
he was constantly striving in his methods to 
reach principles that would work. He made 
many blunders, but these very failures helped 
him to understand the psychologic laws of 
mental development. If his methods lacked 
order they were at least suggestive; and edu- 
cation as a means of social reform was by no 
means the least of the ideals which he forced 
on the minds of educational leaders. Pesta-

Mu was unique in applying the principles of 
| growth to the development of the little child 
' in the schoolroom. In order to do this he 
insisted that a spirit of sympathy and love : 
should pervade the schoolroom, and that 
instruction should be based wholly on obser- 
vation. Object teaching lay at the foundation 
of all his methods; he used no books and his 
pupils learned nothing by heart. Most of the 
instruction was confined to drawing, arith- 
metic, and speaking, but he had no plan for 
his work. In spite of all his blundering, he 
never lost sight of his great idea that educa- 
tion should be natural, progressive, and sym- 
‘ metrical, and that human nature itself should 
be the guide. : 
Pestalozzi was never able to formulate his 
principles into an educational system; many 
of his ideas were borrowed from his predeces- 
sors, but he alone had the power to vitalize 
them and adapt them to the mind of the child. 
It is due to the sympathy of his friends and 
pupils that we have anything like a statement 
of his principles and methods. Among the 
.\facts thus given are such as these: that the 
_ mind should be developed, not filled with 
AN 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  96 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
knowledge; that all instruction should be 
based on intuition; that instruction should 
begin with the simplest forms, and should 
progress with the development of the mind; 
that love and sympathy should be a bond of 
union between pupil and teacher. 
Inspired by the spirit of this great educa- 
tor, Froebel, who for a time was a pupil and 
teacher in the institute at Yverdon, con- 
tinued the work which Pestalozzi had begun. 
Almost the counterpart of Pestalozzi, both 
in training and habits of thought, it is in- 
teresting to note that both had the same 
unquenchable love for children, and both 
sought the same ends. 
Unlike Pestalozzi, who was brought up by 
his mother, Froebel, who was motherless, was 
educated by his father and uncle. He de- 
veloped early, and to a remarkable degree, a 
love for nature. Like Pestalozzi, after having 
attempted the various professions in turn, his 
vocation as a teacher was borne in upon him. 
But unlike his master, he knew how to or- 
ganize his principles and methods. His mysti- 
cal nature expressed itself in unique ways. 
To him everything in the universe expressed
-P-A-G-E-109
  PESTALOZZI, AND THE KINDERGARTEN 97 
unity, and all objects were symbolic of the 
Deity. This led to a peculiar emphasis of the 
sphere as the basis of his educational methods. 
Though his principles were applicable to all 
grades of teaching, he devoted himself exclu- 
sively to the instruction of very small chil- 
dren. He is now recognized as the founder of 
the kindergarten, the crowning feature of the 
modern system of education. The kinder- 
garten is based upon the child’s instinctive   
love of play. Self-activity is directed ‘through 
the medium of coed the child learns 
to construct-te-invent, to speak, and to be 
thoughtful « of others. The means employed 
to develop the creative faculties are a series 
of objects called gifts, five in number, which 
he uses to illustrate the ‘‘connection of con- 
trasts.”” These gifts consist of the sphere, 
divided cubes, cylinders, cones, ete., and are 
for the purpose of teaching new ideas, to de- 
velop a continuity in the self-activity of the 
child, and to help him to relate himself to the 
greater world outside. 
With Froebel all education is an evolu- 
tionary process, and by means of play and 
hand-training he seeks to guide nature to a 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
higher plane than it could otherwise reach. 
One of the innovations which he introduced 
into his schools was the training of women to 
become the teachers of little children. He 
believed that women were peculiarly adapted 
by nature to lead the young child. 
With the work of such educators as Pes- 
talozzi and Froebel new ideals have been 
established—.in—elementary instruction. A 
spirit of love and sympathy are now deemed 
the chief factors in all teaching. Self-activity 
and spontaneity are considered necessary to 
right development, and it is recognized that 
early education and spiritual growth go hand 
in hand. A new interest has been fostered in 
child-study, for the child at last has come into 
its birthright. Individuality must be main- 
tained, but it should be guided rationally, 
sympathetically, and intelligently.

INFLUENCE OF WOMAN ON EDUCATION 
In ancient times woman was little more 
than a slave. She was thought to possess no 
soul, and the chief end of her existence was to 
obey the will of her husband and give pleasure 
to him. He was not only her superior but her 
lord and master. By virtue of her natural 
fitness, she was given the instruction of her 
young children during the years of their 
infancy. In order to do this, there was re- 
quired no intellectual training, for the mode 
of life was simple in the extreme. The sub- 
stance of all maternal instruction was obe- 
dience and virtue. The girls and women knew 
little except the domestic arts in their most 
rudimentary form, and the art of pleasing 
man. 
So powerful is the influence of tradition on 
the human mind that such a conception of 
woman has been slow to give way to the 
higher ideal of equality. Here and there, at 
different epochs, we find rare examples of 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
notable women who exercised wonderful in- 
fluence over their people. During the early 
days of Rome maternal instruction was at its 
best. With the moral degeneracy which set in 
under the Emperors, due to a certain extent 
to the fact that mothers had left their children 
to the instruction of slaves and hirelings, there 
came a corresponding decline in the education 
of: women. In the centuries of medieval 
times, and in the period of the Renaissance, 
little or no thought was given to the train- 
ing of girls beyond the simplest of household 
duties. In the families of the nobility and 
among the wealthy classes, the polite arts and 
accomplishments of society were added to the 
instruction; but in no sense did the girls re- 
ceive equal training with the boys; and, in 
the case of the very poor, they received none 
at all. 
France was the country in which the power 
of woman’s influence was most noticeably 
felt. The brilliancy of the French salons, the 
intrigues of the court, and the dictates of 
polite society were all subject to the influence 
of the French women. For more than two 
centuries following the Renaissance woman
-P-A-G-E-113
  INFLUENCE OF WOMAN ON EDUCATION 101 
had practically ruled the diplomatic world. 
She was able to do this, however, by the power 
of her personal charms, wit, and accomplish- 
ments, not by her intellectual attainments, 
for woman was still considered the inferior of 
man, and her education was regarded as of 
little value. To be sure, Madame de Sévigné 
was a woman of remarkable talent and edu- 
cation, but she did not interest herself particu- 
larly in the education of women as a class. 
Madame de Maintenon did, however, devote 
a long life to the better instruction of girls, 
and made a beginning in that long struggle 
for recognition of equality between the sexes 
as regards education and culture. Little by 
little it began to be recognized that a woman’s 
power was made doubly effective when it was 
reinforced by systematic training. When 
Rousseau’s Emile was scattered broadcast 
throughout the Continent of Europe, new 
ideas regarding society and education took 
hold of the people, and education became 
everywhere an object of interest and atten- 
tion. To none did Rousseau appeal more suc- 
cessfully than to the women; and almost im- 
mediately there arose a flood of small writers.

Among them were many women, who advo-

the necessity for an education of all the peo- 
ple, no matter what their rank or fortune 
might be. 
In this new conception of education, the 
instruction of girls became a matter of prime 
- importance; and the discussion of their edu- 
cation by women was an epoch-marking fea- 
ture. Among'the first of this new régime was 
Madame de Genlis, a woman of almost ency- 
clopedic knowledge. Versatile, bright, and 
energetic, she was a true woman of the world. 
She had the teaching spirit within her, and 
planned the most wonderful courses in a uni- 
versal instruction, which her ever-ready pen 
gave to the world. She criticized Rousseau 
for his unnatural naturalism, but embodied 
his principles in her own writings. Though 
she was superficial in her mode of expression, 
she succeeded in making her power felt, and 
aroused attention to the need of more scien- 
tific procedure in the matter of training young 
children. 
Of an entirely different temper and spirit 
was Miss Maria Edgeworth, of England,
-P-A-G-E-115
INFLUENCE OF WOMAN ON EDUCATION 103 
whose preface to her book on Practical Edu- 
cation began with these words: “‘ We shall not 
imitate the invidious example of some authors, 
who think it necessary to destroy the edifices 
of others, in order to clear the way for their 
own. . . . We have chosen the title of Prac- 
tical Education, to point out that we rely 
entirely upon practice and experience. To « 
make any progress in the art of education, it 
must be patiently reduced to an experimental 
science.” These last sentences give the key- 
note of her invaluable book, Practical Educa- 
tion. In this she did not attempt to propound 
any new theory or principle of education; but 
she has, in a clear, systematic way, presented 
methods which are based upon the psycho- 
logic development of the mind. The book is 
well worth re-reading many times even in 
these days of abundant educational liter- 
ature. 
Miss Elizabeth Hamilton, another English 
author, wrote from a more philosophic point 
of view. She asserted that “Rules are less 
necessary than principles,” for, “without 
some knowledge of the human mind,” labor 
in the work of education is frequently lost. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  104 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
“Nor can I,” she said, “plead the cause of 
my sex more effectually than by explaining 
the influence of early education; and thus 
rendering it evident to every unprejudiced 
mind, that if women were so educated as to 
qualify them for the proper performance of 
this momentous duty, it would do more 
towards the progressive improvement of the 
species, than all the discoveries of science, and 
the researches of philosophy.”! The broad 
scope of her thought was expressed in the 
following words: “My plan has for its object 
the subjection of the passions, the direction of 
the affections, and the cultivation of the fac- 
ulties that are common to the whole human 
race.” Realizing that “the effects of associa- 
tion are daily experienced by all,” she made 
the application of the laws of association of 
ideas a duty of the first importance. “If we 
acquire a proper view of the necessity of per- 
fecting the intellectual and moral powers of 
our children,”’ she said, “we shall adopt the 
means best suited to views so comprehensive. 
The woman who would educate her children 
with success must begin by educating her-

-P-A-G-E-117
INFLUENCE OF WOMAN ON EDUCATION 105 
self.” ‘If we admit, as a fundamental princi- 
ple, that the true end of education is to bring 
all the powers and faculties of our nature to 
the highest perfection of which they are ca- 
pable, it evidently follows, that an adequate 
knowledge of these powers and faculties is 
absolutely necessary towards the accomplish- 
ment of the end we have in view.” “In order 
to cultivate the intellectual faculties to ad- 
vantage, it appears to me that we ought to 
accompany nature in her progress; and as 
she gradually unfolds the powers of the mind, 
that we should devote ourselves to the im- 
provement of each faculty, in the order it is 
by her presented.” 
With this aim Madame Campan in France 
also worked steadfastly. It was her great de- 
sire that all pupils attending her boarding- 
schools should be “assured of the happiness 
of being able to instruct their own daughters.” 
Conspicuous among the women writers of 
France was Madame de Rémusat, a brilliant 
woman of the court of Josephine. Although 
she had nothing to do with organizing or 
supervising schools, she had noble ideas con- 
cerning the welfare of women. She believed
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
that their education should be serious and for 
the public good. 
Madame Guizot established in her contri- 
butions to educational literature the most 
lofty ethical ideals in the training of children. 
She believed that education begins with the 
first breath, and that as early as possible 
a spirit of reason and of liberty should be 
formed in the child. 
This early education was more elabor- 
ately treated by her contemporary, Madame 
Necker de Saussure, in her book, Progressive 
Education, which is a classic in French liter- 
ature. With intuitive insight into child- 
nature Madame Necker described the duties 
and possibilities of the mother in the training 
of her children. She believed that moral edu- 
cation is the most important of all training, 
but that this duty should not be delegated to 
the convent, or the teacher, but should be 
given by the mother herself; that the peculiar 
sympathy existing between parent and child 
makes it possible to distinguish in the child 
acts which are simply instinctive with its 
childhood from those which are traits of an 
older growth. Like Rousseau, she divided
-P-A-G-E-119
  INFLUENCE OF WOMAN ON EDUCATION 107 
education into periods which correspond to 
the periods of growth, but unlike Rousseau, 
she believed that the moral education could 
not be separated from physical education, nor 
could it begin too soon. 
With such women as these to champion the 
cause of childhood, an entirely new concep- 
tion of duty was formulated. Woman was no 
longer the inferior of man, but his partner, to 
be equally trained for equal responsibilities. 
Motherhood took on new importance, and 
child-study became a science. The influence 
of Pestalozzi and Froebel was emphasized by 
these notable women. 
Nowhere has this new influence been more 
noticeably felt than in America. Through the 
efforts of such noble women as Miss Blow, 
Miss Peabody, and Mrs. Shaw, the kinder- 
garten has been established in nearly every 
part of the United States, while the spirit of 
the new education has permeated every infant 
classrooni. 
The part which women themselves have 
taken in the discussion of formal education 
has been the main influence in the marked 
change toward the enlarging of woman’s
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
sphere. The value of her work to beget and 
to train future generations is understood as 
never before. In order to meet the high de- 
mands required of her, a wise and broad edu- 
cation is necessary. This has been the motive 
at work in the past fifty years. Everywhere 
colleges and universities are opening their 
doors to the call of woman. She has fitted 
herself not only to be the friend of man, but a 
eounselor to him. She occupies places of judi- 
cial importance on school boards, and even 
superintends the systems of large cities. 
There are colleges that have women as their 
presidents. Practically there are few positions 
for which a woman may not qualify and which 
she cannot ably fill. 
With the conception that men and women 
have equal rights and equal abilities anew 
impulse was given education. That this ideal 
has become an essential feature of all modern 
education is due chiefly to the energy of the 
distinguished women of the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries.

XI 
EDUCATION AND THE STATE 
Wirn the conquest of paganism by Chris- 
_ tianity, there began the tendency in the 
Church to impose the principle of authority on 
all forms of thought. As a consequence edu- 
cation received a moral and religious bias that 
delayed human progress for nearly a thousand 
years, and that has never entirely ceased to 
exist. 
Realizing that children were everywhere 
surrounded with bad examples, the Church 
early took upon herself the task of teaching 
them not only the catechism and the Bible, 
but also the simple rudiments of elementary 
instruction. Catechetical schools sprang up 
in great numbers; and, as the pagan schools 
gradually disappeared, the monasteries began 
to engage in educational work. 
During the dark period of the Middle Ages 
the parochial, monastic, and cathedral schools 
offered the only opportunity for intellectual 
culture. Indeed, during this whole epoch the
-P-A-G-E-122
  110 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
Church, regarding education as one of her 
peculiar functions, decreed that, “Wherever 
God raised up able men for teachers, all suit- 
able efforts should be made to found public 
schools, so that the fruits of both kinds of 
knowledge, spiritual and secular, might grow 
in the Church.” This early alliance of Church 
and school not only gave to education a dis- 
tinct moral aim, but made it both natural and 
possible for the modern Church to question 
the right of the State to control education. 
In an age of superstition and ignorance the 
work of Charlemagne stood out in bold relief. 
In spite of the prevalent idea that the Church 
was supreme in authority, Charlemagne in- 
sisted upon the right to open the monastery 
schools for the benefit of the people. He be- 
lieved that religious training was important 
and necessary, and that civilization depended 
on Christianity. He also thought that edu- 
cation should serve the interests of the State, 
and that it should, therefore, be made uni- 
versal. He was the first in history to conceive 
the idea of national education, and to intro- 
duce the practice of compulsory attendance. 
But the Church was not in sympathy with is
-P-A-G-E-123
EDUCATION AND THE STATE lll 
the advanced ideas of Charlemagne; and when 
he died the clergy lost no time in gaining 
supremacy over his weak successors, and in 
establishing again the authority of the Church 
in all temporal affairs. Thus what had prom- 
ised to be not only a revival of learning, but 
also a step toward making education a func- 
tion of the State was soon forgotten. 
Not until the period of the Reformation, 
when Luther said, ““We are at the dawn of 
a new era,” do we see a determined effort on 
the part of the reformers to shift the burden 
and the responsibility of education from the 
~ Church to the State.} This idea grew in im= 
portance when it was seen that greater intel- 
ligence among the masses was necessary to the 
reform of abuses in the Church. The Bible 
was a sealed book to the people so long as 
they could not read. Hence while Luther’s 
chief energies were directed toward purifying 
and elevating the clergy, he soon saw that 
there was need of providing greater oppor- 
tunity for popular education. In his famous 
letter to the “Magistrates of all Cities of 
Germany,” Luther insisted that every child 
had a right to be educated; that the State
-P-A-G-E-124
12 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
must provide the means to that end, and not 
leave instruction solely to the inclination of 
the parents. For the welfare of the State 
“does not depend,” he said, “alone on its 
treasures, its beautiful buildings, and its 
military equipment, but upon its having 
many polished, learned, intelligent, honorable, 
and well-bred citizens, who, when they have 
become all this, may then get wealth and put 
it to a good use.”’ Again he wrote, “My opin- 
ion is, the authorities are bound to force their 
subjects to send their children to school. If 
they can oblige their subjects to carry spears 
and guns, to do all military duties, with better 
reason can and ought they to force them to 
send their children to school.” “The world 
has need,” he said, “of educated men and 
women, to the end that the men may govern 
the country properly, and that the women 
may properly bring up their children, care for 
their domestics, and direct the affairs of their 
households.” This forceful appeal of Luther 
was not wholly fruitless. In a few years pri- 
mary schools were established by the Gov- 
ernment in most of the Protestant States of 
Germany. But, although the rulers desired to
-P-A-G-E-125
  EDUCATION AND THE STATE: 113 
increase their power and might by alliance 
with educational institutions, the common 
people, as a class, did not respond to this 
effort for their intellectual improvement. 
Consequently what Luther with marvelous 
foresight urged upon the German municipali- 
ties was left largely to his friend, Philip 
Melanchthon, to put into practice. The 
“Saxony School Plan” which Melanchthon 
drew up in 1528 was the first step toward a 
State school system. 
Little by little it came to be understood 
that all. men had a right to instruction, and 
that the State must assume the duty of secur- 
ing it. But, unfortunately, many of the efforts 
to achieve universal education were brought 
to naught by the terrible devastation of the 
Thirty Years’ War. The people were too 
much engrossed by sorrow and warfare to care 
for education. Many schools were abandoned 
and some universities gave up their charters. 
There were but few who apprehended the idea 
of popular education. Impoverished as the 
people were by the ravages of war, they mur- 
mured against the imposition of any additional 
tax. Yet in spite of these discouragements, the
-P-A-G-E-126
114 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
Protestant States of Germany established an 
association between the national religion and 
the educational duties of the State. 
For years Europe, swayed by religious up- 
heaval, knew not whether to accept the au- 
thority of Church or State. What popular 
prejudice and warfare could not annul was 
left to the order of the Jesuits to overthrow. 
This order in the Catholic Church, organ- 
ized primarily to extend the authority of the 
Church and incidentally to increase the effi- 
ciency of her schools, became, through its 
widespreading influence, one of the most 
powerful opponents of the State in its at- 
tempt to secularize education. This remark- 
able teaching order practically took possession 
of education in all Catholic countries for a 
period of two hundred years. 
But the influence of the reformers on edu- 
cation was by no means lost. The human 
mind continued to assert its right to reason. 
It was no longer willing to accept the time- 
worn traditions of the Church; and, in the 
reaction against her authority, there was 
created a public opinion in favor of secular 
control of the schools.
-P-A-G-E-127
EDUCATION AND THE STATE 115 
This was made the more possible by the 
neglect.-with which the Jesuits had treated 
primary education. Their elaborate curricu- 
lum had made no provision for the instruction 
of young children, for assisting domestics in 
service, or for the education of the masses. It 
was against the artificial life and restricted 
thought which Jesuit teaching had fostered 
that Rousseau roused the half - awakened 
world by writing his book Emile. The enthu- 
siasm for childhood which he excited among 
all the great thinkers and educators of his day 
developed into an intense passion in Pesta- 
lozzi. Though unlearned and without skill or 
system, Pestalozzi succeeded in arousing a 
widespread and general interest in the cause 
of education. He insisted that it should be 
made possible to the whole people. It was 
just at the height of Pestalozzi’s fame that 
Germany met her prostrating defeat at Jena 
under the victorious arms of Napoleon. In 
this dark hour of humiliation she was roused 
to the task of regeneration by Fichte, who 
summoned the nation to retrieve her losses by 
means of universal education. Thirty years 
before, Frederick the Great had foreseen that 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  116. THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
the prosperity and power of the State were 
’ dependent on the intelligence of her people, 
and had laid down broad lines for the compul- 
,sory education of both sexes; but, as the en- 
‘forcement of his recommendations had been 
left largely.to the local authorities, instruc- 
tion. was either poorly given or altogether 
neglected. During his reign the greatest 
scholars and jurists of Germany were en- 
gaged in codifying the Prussian Civil law. 
The results of their labor were not published 
until 1794. In that year the school law was 
passed which permitted religious freedom, 
and made all schools, both private and pub- 
‘lic, ‘subject. to the control of the State. In 
spite of the urgent demands of the German 
educators it was not until 1806, when defeat 
in arms had brought the nation to a realizing- 
sense that national power and wealth must 
ever depend on popular intelligence, that she 
gave heed to the eloquent appeals of Fichte. 
The Emperor Frederick William ITI addressed 
his people in these words: “‘ We have lost in 
territory, and fallen in external power; hence, 
it is my earnest desire that the greatest at- 
tention be given to the instruction of the
-P-A-G-E-129
  " EDUCATION AND THE STATE 117 
people.” He was ably supported by his min- 
isters, and under the influence of Humboldt, 
who has been called “a great master of the 
science and art of education,” the methods 
of instruction in the elementary public schools 
were revolutionized and based on the princi- 
ples of Pestalozzi. Though meeting with much 
opposition Humboldt succeeded, during the 
years 1809 to 1811, in raising the teaching 
profession to a high rank. Since that time 
education has been either directly or indi- 
rectly under the control of the State. 
But Germany was not alone in feeling the 
impulse created by the reformers. In 1560, 
about forty years after Luther’s famous ap- 
peal, there arose in France a strong desire on 
the part of the’nobility to levy a contribution 
for the support of teachers for the instruction 
of poor children. They also urged compulsory 
attendance. But with the rise of the Jesuit 
schools this petition was unheeded and pri- 
mary instruction was altogether ignored. The 
Church, through what were called teaching 
congregations, assumed the exclusive control 
of education, and for two centuries the cause of 
popular education in France suffered eclipse. 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
Although this state of affairs existed in 
regard to primary instruction, it is interesting 
to note that, in the year 1600, King Henry IV 
directly intervened in the control of the Uni- 
versity of Paris, and named a commission to 
remodel its statutes. This is the first instance 
in France in which secular power opposed the 
absolutism of the Church. 
The restlessness of the age shows that inter- 
est in popular education was not wholly lost. 
There was exhibited here and there a sincere 
desire to uplift the masses by means of charity 
schools; and, what was more important, to 
insist that such instruction should be com- 
pulsory. Though the work of Jean la Salle, 
priest and apostle to the common people, was 
defective and inadequate in many ways, he 
was greatly to be commended for his untiring 
effort to establish primary schools for the poor 
of France. 
With the age of “The Enlightenment” 
came the overthrow of the Jesuit power in 
France. It was at this psychological moment 
that Rousseau made his vigorous appeal for 
humanity. 
_ The period of the eighteenth century was
-P-A-G-E-131
EDUCATION AND THE STATE 119 
one of great intellectual brilliancy. The phi- 
losophers of that age took no little interest in 
the cause of education, and their advanced 
ideas strengthened, in the minds of the mem- 
bers of the Parliament of Paris, the growing 
conception of popular instruction. Already 
the need of secularizing education had been 
recognized; but, as yet, no one had had the 
power to put it in practice. 
One of the most famous of the Parliamen- 
tary members, La Chalotais, in his Essai 
d’éducation nationale, said: “I dare claim for 
the nation an education which depends only 
on the State, because it belongs essentially to 
the State.” 
Rolland, who was the president of the Par- 
liament of Paris, was an administrator as well 
as a theorist. He took a decided stand for the 
diffusion of knowledge. ‘Each one,” he said, 
“ought to have the opportunity to receive 
the education which is adapted to his needs.” 
In order to achieve his idea of universal knowl- 
edge, he planned “‘to make Paris the center of 
public instruction.” Thus he was one of the 
first to conceive of a centralizing power. 
-, Preceding the Revolution, Turgot, another 
, 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
theorist, also demanded civil and national 
education. He felt that the only way for the 
State to preserve its integrity was to assume 
the duty of controlling public education. 
Although these men were in the main only 
theorists, it was due to their efforts that the 
men of the Revolution were able to bring 
about legislative acts embodying these 
theories. 
In 1791 public opinion had grown so strong 
in favor of liberty of teaching that it became 
the settled purpose of the Revolutionists “to 
guarantee the right of free inquiry,” and to 
establish for all citizens the means to obtain 
the knowledge that is most necessary to man. 
Therefore one of the decrees of the Constitu- 
tion of September 4, 1791, was, “There shall 
be created and organized a system of public 
instruction, common to all citizens, and gratu- 
itous with respect to those branches of instruc- 
tion which are indispensable for all men.” 
During the troublous times that followed the 
uprising of the French people, bills and coun- 
terbills without number were passed by the 
Convention. Education and politics seemed 
to be hopelessly entangled. Before one bill for
-P-A-G-E-133
  EDUCATION AND THE STATE 121 
the betterment of the schools could be put in 
operation, it was revoked and another passed. 
In spite of all the inconsistencies in the legis- 
lative acts of the Convention, there steadily 
grew the conception that the preservation and 
the prosperity of the State depend upon three 
great principles: free education; compulsory 
attendance; and universal instruction. But, 
though there was so marked a tendency in the 
State to assume the control of education, it 
‘was many years before this theory was put 
into practice. 
After Napoleon had made himself Emperor 
of France, he turned his attention to the cause 
of education. In 1806 he founded the Univer- 
sity of France, which became throughout the 
length and breadth of the empire the central 
power of instruction. In doing this he estab- 
lished an organization that is the basis of the 
present educational system. But he gave little 
attention to primary instruction. It was not 
until 1833 that Guizot, the Minister of Public 
Instruction, brought about the passage of a 
bill that made primary instruction free for 
poor children. By this act the Government 
established schools for each commune and 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  122 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
claimed the right to appoint the teachers. In 
a notable letter Guizot declared that ‘Uni- 
versal primary instruction is henceforth to 
be one of the guarantees of order and social 
stability.” Nevertheless the cause of compul- 
sory education was of slow growth. During 
the years of the Second Republic the school 
laws were revised, and primary schools for 
girls were made obligatory. But it was not 
until after the overwhelming humiliation of 
the Franco-Prussian War that the French 
people were thoroughly aroused to the impor- 
tance of popular education. Then in the early 
days of the Third Republic, they established 
a perfectly organized system of- primary 
instruction which is “obligatory, gratuitous, 
and secular.” 
In England the cause of education has been 
one_of slow evolution. The conservative 
nature of the people and the aristocratic 
habits of the nobility have tended to keep all 
institutions of learning exclusively for the 
benefit of the-rich. From earliest days the 
idea has been dominant that the rich were 
entitled to certain privileges upon which the 
masses must not encroach. Education that
-P-A-G-E-135
  EDUCATION AND THE STATE 123 
would tend to elevate an individual above his 
station was looked at askance both by society 
and by the Church. 
During the years preceding the Reforma- 
tion there were, with the exception of the 
great universities, Oxford and Cambridge, 
practically few schools that could be called 
public. Up to that time the monasteries had 
furnished the only means for instructing the 
sons of gentlemen. When the monasteries 
were suppressed a part of their funds was 
taken to erect and endow grammar schools. 
But, unfortunately, the religious controversies 
of the sixteenth century had a most disastrous 
effect on education. Many times these funds 
were absorbed by the State, so that the 
schools were either closed altogether or else 
continued a miserable existence with greatly 
diminished endowments. There were some, 
however, founded about this time, that have 
become justly famous. These are the great 
preparatory schools of Rugby, Eton, Harrow, 
Winchester, Westminster, St. Paul’s, Shrews- 
bury, Merchant Taylors’, Charterhouse, and 
Christ’s Hospital. Even then only the rich 
were instructed at these schools; the masses
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
had not yet come into prominence.. When the 
Civil War ended, a new idea as to the purpose 
of education became manifest. To such 
leaders as Edward Colston and Robert Nelson 
it seemed that the best way to correct the so- 
cial evils of the day was to establish schools 
for the poor. These were of a distinctly new 
type. The children were dressed in a peculiar 
costume to show that they were objects of 
charity, and to “remind them of their rank.” 
The instruction was in the catechism and in 
‘such duties as belonged to the humble walks 
of life. The fear lest the poor should rise 
above their station caused these institutions, 
while offering the simple rudiments of educa- 
tion, to become quite humiliating and almost 
feudal in their character. Yet it is a noticeable 
thing that, during the eighteenth century, 
these charity schools rapidly multiplied. Men 
of wealth ceased to endow grammar schools, 
and, instead, erected charity schools. In a 
much humbler way Robert Raikes established 
in 1781 what proved to be a permanent insti- 
tution. This was the Sunday school. These 
schools, crganized at first to give secular as 
well as religious instruction, supplied the
-P-A-G-E-137
EDUCATION AND THE STATE 125 
needs of the very poor. But with the develop- 
ment of the day schools and of the system of 
Parliamentary grants, Sunday schools gradu- 
ally restricted their scope to purely religious 
instruction. By means of his own personal 
effort Raikes not only succeeded in inspiring 
other philanthropists to engage in the work 
of teaching the poor, but he also aroused a 
genuine interest in popular instruction. 
In the latter part of the eighteenth century 
Joseph Lancaster, a Quaker, and Dr. Bell, a 
member of the Church of England, started 
almost simultaneously a monitorial system of 
schools. By means of this kind of instruction, 
classes to the extent of a thousand pupils 
could be taught. This brought the possibility 
of universal education nearer to realization. 
The popularity of these schools soon attracted 
the attention of the nobility and Churchmen. 
Nonconformists and the Whigs supported 
Lancaster and established a society called the 
British and Foreign School Society. The 
powerful body of Churchmen gave their sup- 
port to Bell in the party called National. 
Owing to the rivalry of these two societies, 
schools for popular instruction multiplied
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 | THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
very rapidly during the early part of the nine- 
teenth century. When, after a long contro- 
versy over the right of the Government to 
interfere in popular education, a grant was 
given annually to each of these societies for 
the support of their schools, the first step was 
taken toward State control of education. 
These grants were gradually increased and 
made to depend upon certain conditions. By 
the Education Act of 1870 a system of free 
elementary schools was established, to be 
controlled by the State. These schools were 
called the “‘board schools” in distinction from 
the “voluntary schools” or those supported 
by the Church societies. Because religious 
instruction has always held a prominent place 
in the curricula of both systems a long and 
an acute struggle has arisen over the appor- 
tionment of the Parliamentary grant. This 
problem will probably for many years remain 
unsolved. In spite of this agitation, however, 
the conception of popular education con- 
trolled by the central Government is fast 
becoming an ideal of the English nation. 
The twentieth century opens with popular 
and compulsory education well established as
-P-A-G-E-139
  EDUCATION AND THE STATE 127 
a State function. Not only has the minimum 
of instruction been assured to every child, but 
also every effort is made to induce the future 
citizen to accept the opportunities offered for 
higher education, and thus fit himself for the 
career which is always open to talent. But the 
form which this education takés is, for the 
most part, determined by national charac- 
teristics. 
In Germany, at the present time, each 
State has its own system of public schools 
supported by taxes and a general State fund. 
Though independent of one another, there is 
a mutual agreement in the systems that prac- 
tically makes them one. A Minister of Educa- 
tion directs the administration of the schools 
through well-organized local boards. These 
boards have a voice in the choice of teachers, 
and determine the amount of salary to be 
paid. Only professionally trained teachers 
can be employed. Compulsory attendance 
which from long practice has become almost 
automatic, is a prominent feature of the sys- 
tem. The German schools, in their efforts to 
reach the masses, are considered the most 
efficient in the world.  
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
In no country has such rapid progress been 
made in the constructing of a school system as 
in France. In a period of twenty-five years 
she has developed a most perfect type of a 
State system of education. The schools, from 
the lowest grade, or mother school, to that 
of the university, are closely articulated and 
directed by a strongly organized central 
power. All of these are free and are taught by 
thoroughly trained lay teachers. While local 
conditions are studied, the ideals and aims of 
the schools are inspired by the State. 
Owing to the conservative nature of her 
people, England has found it difficult in the 
past to enact measures that would meet the 
demands of the time. The history of edu- 
cation, therefore, in that country has been 
largely a record of experiments. At the pres- 
ent time there are two systems of schools, 
both well organized and supported by local 
taxes and Parliamentary grants. 
In these schools the “pupil teacher,” a 
product of the old monitorial system, is now 
superseded by the “‘assistant” and graduate 
teacher. There are a central board of educa- 
tion and a body of royal inspectors, whose
-P-A-G-E-141
i 
  EDUCATION AND THE STATE 129 
duty it is to visit and report on every school 
in the realm. Thus, though England has had 
many traditions and much conservatism to 
overcome, she has, at least, carried the idea 
of popular education controlled by the State 
into every corner of the kingdom. 
Thus, after centuries of struggle, has been 
gradually realized the ideal, that the State 
“Father than the Church is competent to.ad- 
minister the affairs of education; that what 
“was once claimed by the Church to be her 
exclusive right is now one of the many func- 
tions of the State.

THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 
In America the development of the Public 
School System as it is known to-day has been 
slow and tedious. Some of the causes of this 
have been, the traditional ideal of education 
brought from England; the institution of 
slavery; the increasing percentage of foreign 
population; the differing demands of city and 
tural life; the racial question; and economic 
problems. 
Though hampered by these unusual condi- 
tions, it has gradually become the belief of the 
nation that the prosperity of the nation and 
the welfare of the people depend not only on 
giving every child instruction, but also in 
inspiring and helping him to utilize his knowl- 
edge. 
The history of education in America may 
be traced through three distinct periods: the 
colonial; the period from the Revolution to 
the Rebellion; and the modern period. 
In the early colonial days education and
-P-A-G-E-143
THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 131 
religion were inseparably connected. It was 
the necessity for guarding the religious wel- 
fare of the colonies that led to the establish- 
ment of the public schools for the training of 
youth for the ministry. In many of the early 
colonies the church and the schoolhouse stood 
side by side. 
Both the first settlers in Virginia and the 
colonists outside of Massachusetts Bay re- 
tained for a long time their love for the cus- 
toms and manners of the mother land. In the 
South many of the colonists were proprietors 
of large estates, and cherished a feeling of 
aristocratic exclusiveness not found in the 
more enterprising people of New England. 
The children of these Southern colonists were 
instructed by tutors at home or in parish 
schools, and the girls had practically no intel- 
lectual training. The isolation of these large 
estates made it impracticable, even if there 
had been a demand for them, to establish pub- 
lic schools. If the boys were not sent abroad, 
or if they did not have a tutor at home accord- 
ing to the English custom, they grew up in 
ignorance so far as literary knowledge was 
concerned. The early records show, however,
-P-A-G-E-144
OS ee ere se ee ee a 
132 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
that a few scattered parish schools were estab- 
lished as missionary ventures by the Church 
of England. There were also some attempts to 
found private schools. In 1692 the legislature 
of Virginia secured a charter from England for 
the college which had been often discussed but 
never established. This was the beginning of 
the College of William and Mary. 
Many of these schools were supported by 
the tuition fees of the rich. The parish schools, 
which were organized “to instruct orphans 
and to convert Indians,” did not prove suc- 
cessful, though they exhibited the true mis- 
sionary spirit. Many children living in the 
rural districts were neglected altogether. The 
system of land tenure and the institution 
of slavery combined to make the idea of free 
education for all the people unpopular in 
Virginia and in the Southern colonies. 
The oldest school in America was founded 
by the Dutch in New Amsterdam. These 
colonists, like those of New England, were 
a most devout people. They believed in reli- 
gious freedom and in general education. 
Hence, as in New England, the minister and 
the schoolmaster worked together. But un-
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 133 
like the Puritans, who considered only ad- 
vanced education, the Dutch began at the 
bottom of the ladder and provided elemen- 
tary education for all their children. These 
schools were maintained at first wholly by the 
Dutch Reformed Protestant Church, but 
later they came under the control of the 
colony and were supported by taxation. 
When the New York colony passed into the 
possession of England, the schools received a 
serious check. The governor did not favor the 
patronage of the Dutch Reformed Church, 
and frowned equally upon such schools as 
were maintained wholly by the people. In 
order to stimulate loyalty to the Crown of 
England, several Latin grammar schools were 
established, and a college was founded called 
King’s College. This college afterwards be- 
came Columbia University. For a long time 
the Dutch Church and the English Church 
supported rival schools, until stress of cireum- 
stances either closed them altogether or fused 
them into one system of free schools. 
Pennsylvania was also founded by a people 
desirous of religious freedom. In a few years 
after the settlement by the Quakers, great 
   
-P-A-G-E-146
  184 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
numbers of foreigners, attracted by the liberal 
form of government, settled within its bor- 
ders. This condition gave rise to many sec- 
tarian schools, all of which were supported by 
tuition fees. In 1683 the Assembly enacted 
several school laws, one of the most important 
of which was that, “All who have charge of 
children must see that they can read and 
write by the time they are twelve years old.” 
In those early days it was difficult for the 
people to conceive of schools not under the 
patronage of the Church or of some society, 
and the diversity of races became a serious 
drawback to the establishment of free public 
schools. There were, however, many good 
private schools founded by the Moravians 
and by the Quakers, to which pupils came 
from all the colonies. One of the most famous 
of these schools was the Friends’ Public 
School, which is still in existence and known 
as the Penn Charter School. 
New Jersey was so situated that she re- 
ceived the overflow from neighboring colo- 
nies. The people were from the beginning 
interested in schools, but the great variety of 
races complicated the school problem. The
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 135 
first school was established by the Dutch. 
When England took control of New York, her 
influence was soon felt in New Jersey, and for 
a long period popular education was at a 
standstill. There were no free public schools 
at all, but a number of private elementary 
schools and a few excellent grammar schools 
were established. Among these was the 
famous Log College which later became the 
basis of Princeton College. 
The spirit of the New England colonists 
was quite different from that of the Southern 
settlers. The Puritans did not come to Amer- 
ica, as did the colonists of Virginia, for the 
purpose of gaining riches or of displaying 
wealth. They were actuated by the desire of 
living a life of religious freedom. These Puri- 
tans were many of them college-trained men, 
and they had a deep sense of the power which 
knowledge gives its possessor. The history of 
the school system as it was developed in Mas- 
sachusetts is especially interesting because 
of the fact that in Massachusetts world-wide 
traditions and awakening impulses have been 
felt to an unusual degree. 
In the beginning, the curriculum of the
-P-A-G-E-148
136 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
schools was as medieval in character as that 
of the English schools in the time of Elizabeth, 
and quite as undemocratic. The education 
received by the majority of the people was 
that gained from the common experience of 
daily life. 
In spite of many hardships, and within five 
years of their settlement in and around Bos- 
ton, the colonists established a college, which 
was later named Harvard College in memory 
of John Harvard, a minister of the colony who 
had bequeathed his library and half his prop- 
erty to the new institution. Besides this, the 
colonists enacted a law that every child should 
learn to read; to understand the principles of 
religion and of the laws of the land; and to 
know how to do some useful work. The law 
did not specify that children should be taught 
in schools; but it did demand that parents 
should fulfill their obligations to their children 
by providing some means of instruction. In 
order to assist parents to obey this compul- 
sory law, a few grammar schools were estab- 
lished, which were patterned both in method 
and in means of support after the English 
schools. The peculiar conditions, however, of
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 137 
New England society made it impracticable 
to continue a form of school support in which 
fees were demanded from some pupils and 
not from others. So these schools were soon 
placed on the basis of taxation, and became 
not only schools for all the people, but also free 
schools. 
One of the conditions for entrance to these 
grammar, or, as they were frequently called, 
Latin schools, was, that children should 
know how to read English by spelling it. This 
gave rise to the so-called “dame schools.” 
These were small private schools which 
women set up in their own homes for the 
teaching of young children. The pupil 
learned to read from the hornbook, primer, 
and catechism. When the girls had mastered 
these books, their intellectual training ceased; 
but the boys were admitted to the Latin or 
grammar schools, where the curriculum was 
the Psalter, Bible, arithmetic, and the Latin 
grammar. When a boy could speak and write 
Latin, read at sight some classical author, and 
inflect Greek nouns and verbs, he was ready 
for Harvard College. 
In 1647 the Massachusetts General Court 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
138 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
framed the most important school law in 
American educational history. It has been 
justly called, “The mother of all our school 
laws,”’ for it established a precedent for our 
present public school system. The main pro- 
visions of this law were: First, there should 
be established an elementary school for every 
fifty families; secondly, a grammar school for 
one hundred families; thirdly, such education 
was to be supported by public tax. This law 
was so far in advance of the thought of the 
people that it was practically impossible to 
enforce it. Some towns found it much cheaper 
to pay the penalty of a small fine than to pro- 
vide schools. It has been said that Boston 
alone, of all the Massachusetts towns, com- 
plied fully with the requirements of this 
educational law. 
The other colonies of New England ex- 
hibited an interest in education similar to that 
shown by Massachusetts. Connecticut, after 
her first settlements were made, lost no time 
in getting schools established. As early as 
1639 evidence points to the founding of a 
school. In 1650 a code of laws was framed 
which contained provisions for schools. These
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 139 
were plainly based upon the Massachusetts 
Law of 1647. A common English education 
was made compulsory, and girls, as well as 
boys, were to be instructed. In 1701 Elihu 
Yale founded Yale College for the purpose 
of educating a Christian ministry. 
Unfortunately for the development of 
schools, the country was soon plunged into 
the Revolutionary War. After many years of 
struggle, and high taxation, education again 
came to the front; and with a republican form 
of government, the ideal of education began 
slowly to change. The new Constitution 
made no provision for popular education, and 
the conditions of life in the original States 
were so varied that a national system of 
schools was impossible. Thus the mainte- 
nance of schools was left entirely to the indi- 
vidual States. With the era of peace came 
great national prosperity and expansion. The 
vast territory of the Northwest opened up 
great possibilities to veteran pioneers. The 
Government sold large tracts of land with the 
stipulation that a certain portion in the center 
of each township should be reserved for edu- 
cational purposes. In a few years thousands  
-P-A-G-E-152
    140 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
of emigrants from the Eastern States poured 
into the Ohio region. It not infrequently hap- 
pened that the log schoolhouse was the first 
public building to be erected. A noticeable 
feature of the Western settlements was that 
popular education began with the common 
school and extended upward to the high 
school and State university. This was quite 
contrary to the ideals brought from England. 
From the beginning coeducation was prac- 
ticed as a matter of convenience and economy. 
One new State after another developed its 
school system, later in time, but upon the 
general plan of the Ohio schools. 
But in New England the ungraded district 
school and the academy took the place of the 
declining public school, which had been prac- 
tically a fitting-school for college. Girls were 
given more opportunities than ever before; 
and, influenced by the writings of Miss Edge- 
worth, Miss Hamilton, and the French 
women, teachers established many fine private 
schools for girls, in which the training far 
outstripped that of any existing institutions. 
The schools first established in the colonies 
were supported almost entirely by tuition fees
-P-A-G-E-153
THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 141 
or by private endowment. Later, when it 
became necessary to provide instruction for 
the children of indigent parents, small local 
taxes were levied for the maintenance of free 
or charity schools. When, still later, the colo- 
nies acquired the right of independent state- 
hood, a new conception crept into the idea of 
education, and more and more the State rec- 
ognized its obligation to provide adequate 
funds for the struggling town or district. 
These funds were raised in-various ways, by 
excise fees, fishing rights, land revenues, and 
even by lotteries. It finally became a general 
custom for the States to set apart public lands 
for the benefit of the school funds. While the 
States in the East clung to the semi-public 
schools or academies, those in the West 
adopted almost immediately newer methods 
for bringing higher education within reach of 
all the inhabitants. The National Govern- 
ment encouraged this tendency and gave vast 
tracts of land, as well as large sums of money 
for the support of popular education. Much 
of the national appropriation was devoted, by 
the' individual States, to the founding of in- 
stitutions for higher education. Many of the
-P-A-G-E-154
  142 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
State universities and free agricultural col- 
leges originated in the Morrill Act of 1862, 
which apportioned to each State thirty thou- 
sand acres of land, or the equivalent in money, 
for each Representative and Senator in Con- 
gress. 
In the early part of the nineteenth century 
the Lancastrian movement, which had been 
so popular in England, gained a footing in the 
schools of the East, and soon spread as far as 
Charleston in the South and to Cincinnati in 
the West. For nearly thirty years this moni- 
torial system flourished in the academies and 
high schools, but gradually disappeared as the 
public school grew in popularity and as the 
material prosperity of the nation increased. 
Meanwhile great changes were going on. 
Population increased enormously; all sorts of 
industries were established; the rural districts 
were developed, and then were deserted for 
the larger opportunities of the more populous 
cities. The great educational awakening that 
had stirred England and the Continent had 
also left its impress upon New England. 
Up to this time there had been no well- 
organized public school system. Appropria-
-P-A-G-E-155
THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 143 
tions had been small, because the people, as a 
whole, had not awakened to a realizing sense 
of the value of education. Although a board 
of education had been established, and many 
educational leaders had already been at work 
in certain directions, the actual beginning of a 
graded school system is due to the generous, 
self - sacrificing spirit, the rare insight, and 
untiring zeal of Horace Mann. 
The same kind of work was taken up by 
Henry Barnard in Connecticut. These two 
men brought about an educational reform 
that was felt in the most remote State of the 
Union. 
With the establishment of normal schools 
in the East, there came a noticeable improve- 
ment in methods of teaching. School laws 
were also revised; schools were graded; text- 
books were improved; and school supervision 
was inaugurated. 
Although one speaks of the American com- 
mon school as if there was but one system 
throughout the United States, there is, as a 
matter of fact, no national system such as is 
found in France or Germany. The common 
school of America is the product of conditions
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
in a new land. The Federal Government does 
not encroach upon the functions of the State 
Governments. Each State solves its own pe- 
culiar problems in different ways, yet there is, 
running through all, a certain national pur- 
pose which tends to unify the systems. The 
various units of organization which differ with 
different parts of the country are the district, 
the city or town, the county, and the State. 
In some form or other, the district school 
system is found in many of the States. It is 
the smallest unit in school administration, 
and dates from the earliest colonial days. In 
' most of the Western States, and especially in 
all rural districts, it is still the unit of organi- 
zation. New York State has a highly de- 
veloped district system, but this is dominated 
by a strong State supervision. 
The units of city or town are fast supersed- 
ing those of the district. They are practically 
mergers of the smaller district units. The two 
benefits derived from this form of organiza- 
tion are a better centralized system and more 
opportunity for secondary education. The 
New England States are good examples of the 
town and city organization.
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 145 
The county unit is the one adopted through- 
out the South. This is due to the fact that 
there the county is the unit in all forms of 
government. In some of the Western States 
the county, as well as the district, is used as a 
unit of organization. In all States employing 
this form of school administration, county 
superintendents are maintained to supervise 
the rural schools. Maryland and Louisiana 
have the best county systems of school ad- 
ministration. : 
The State is the largest unit and controls 
general school legislation. It takes care of 
school funds; collects statistics; makes general 
rules; directs examinations; manages the 
State normal schools; and holds conventions; 
but in no case does it supervise actual meth- 
ods of instruction. Massachusetts, Connecti- 
cut, Rhode Island, and New Jersey have good 
State administration. The North Atlantic 
States exhibit a combination of town, county, 
and State school administration which is 
guided and influenced by the State universi- 
ties. 
New York stands alone in its form of school 
administration. A State Board of Regents 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
146 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
has charge of all educational activities, in- 
cluding private schools and libraries. No 
other American State has exerted so much 
authority over school organization. 
The school systems, in most of the States, 
include a carefully graded series of schools, 
which are absolutely free to all people without 
regard to race or sex. In the South, however, 
separate schools are required for the colored 
race, and in a few of the Western States 
Chinese pupils are not admitted to the pub- 
lic schools. The books and materials for in- 
struction are supplied free of cost. The teach- 
ers are men and women of high culture and 
of professional training. 
Beginning’ with the kindergarten, the child 
passes through the elementary school, con- 
sisting of primary and grammar departments 
and the high or Latin schools. If he desires 
to become a teacher, he spends an additional 
two years or more at a normal school for pro- 
fessional training. If his choice of a vocation 
lies along industrial lines, then he enters some 
scientific, technical, industrial, or vocational 
school. To these schools must be added the 
State colleges for superior training or for 
professional life.
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 147 
* The climax of the system is found not in 
the highest schools but rather in the evening 
schools of all grades and kinds, and in the 
continuation schools in which the child con- 
tinues his general education and takes up 
work that will prepare him to earn a liveli- 
hood. 
Colleges and universities abound evyery- 
where. Most of them are not dependent upon 
appropriations from the State tax, but are 
supported by tuition fees or are endowed by 
private benevolence. 
* Although the territory of the Middle and 
Far West was not opened up until the begin- 
ning of the nineteenth century, the public 
school system has developed there with sur- 
prising rapidity. Almost coincident with the 
settlement of a township, schools of high order 
were established. Emigrants coming from the 
Eastern States had well-defined conceptions 
of the purpose and meaning of education; and 
other settlers, who came from foreign lands, 
were used to compulsory laws of attendance. 
Some States developed more rapidly than 
others, and some were influenced by the diver- 
sity of races; but almost from the start the  
-P-A-G-E-160
148 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
schools have been under public control; have 
enrolled large numbers of pupils; and have 
practiced coeducation not only in the lower 
grades, but also in the colleges and universi- 
ties. Owing to the immense extent and value 
of public school lands, educational progress 
has been able to keep pace with that of the 
industries. 
The States in the South have had a more 
tardy development. This is due to several 
causes. In the early days, public education 
was looked upon with disfavor. The children 
of the rich were educated by tutors, or at 
private institutions, while those of the poor 
either were not educated at all, or attended 
the charity, or “pauper schools.” 
During the Reconstruction period, follow- 
ing the Civil War, the Southern States were 
brought face to face with the problem of free 
popular education. This was the more diffi- 
cult because of the devastation of the large 
estates and the consequent impoverishment of 
the people; the great numbers of freed slaves 
for whom separate schools must be main-— 
tained; and the scattered rural population. 
Government aid and private benefactions
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 149 
have helped to put the Southern schools upon 
a good foundation. Land-grant colleges are 
numerous, and some of the industrial schools, 
notably Hampton and Tuskegee for the 
Indian and Negro, are famous. In many of 
the cities and larger towns the schools already 
compare favorably with those in the North 
and West. 
With the great educational awakening 
which took place about the middle of the 
nineteenth century, there arose the necessity 
for closer and more uniform supervision by 
the State of these great systems of carefully 
organized and graded schools. This supervi- 
sion varies greatly in the different States. In 
some States there is a State Board of Educa- 
tion with a State superintendent; in others the 
supervisory duties are performed by county 
superintendents. In many of the large cities 
and towns throughout the United States there 
is a local school board or committee, with its 
superintendent and assistants. Although the 
Federal Government dictates in no way to the 
several States in regard to the educational 
methods they shall pursue, there has been es- 
tablished in Washington a National Bureau
-P-A-G-E-162
150 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
of Education for the gathering and disseminat- 
ing of educational facts. 
With improved financial conditions of so- 
ciety, there have been larger appropriations 
granted to the schools to meet, the demands 
of the new ideals in education. The little, 
old red schoolhouse, with its uncomfortable 
benches and conspicuous lack of apparatus, 
has given place to beautiful, substantial edi- 
fices valued at hundreds of thousands of dol- 
lars, and equipped with every appliance for 
the most advanced methods of teaching. The 
curriculum, which included in the old days, 
besides the three R’s, only a little of geogra- 
phy and history, has in the elementary schools 
been expanded to admit the study of drawing, 
music, physiology, literature, nature study, 
and manual training; and in the high schools 
to include modern languages, as well as 
the classics, and scientific and commercial 
branches. In fact, the courses are elastic 
enough to meet the demands of the people 
and the time. 
One of the most noticeable features of the 
new régime is the change in the methods of 
teaching. In the early days the old scholastic 
   
-P-A-G-E-163
THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 151 
traditions were strictly adhered to. The 
teacher assigned lessons and the pupils com- 
mitted them to memory. The object was not 
to assimilate and utilize knowledge, but to 
acquire it as so much wealth to be hoarded. 
The disciplinary value of the textbook, as in 
the time of Locke, was held to be an all-pow- 
erfulinfluence. Even now traces of this method 
exist, but this authoritative method has been 
almost entirely superseded by the informal, 
inductive method of oral instruction imparted 
by the teacher. The teacher is no longer a 
tyrant taskmaster, but a sympathetic guide 
and friend. It is not, now, a question of how 
much a child knows of books, but of how 
much general efficiency he develops in his - 
school career. 
With these broader conceptions of educa- 
tion an entirely new spirit has crept into the 
schools. The old severe chastisements are: 
seldom resorted to. Order is maintained out 
of respect to the rights of others. A whole- 
some, happy spirit of good will is everywhere 
manifest. Much of this is the result of the 
introduction of kindergartens into the public 
school system.
-P-A-G-E-164
  152 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
The spirit of the time is also a great factor 
in the new educational ideal. A large-hearted, 
open-handed philanthropy characterizes the 
people of the twentieth century. There is a 
greater love for fair play; even the little child 
has recognized rights, and a helping hand is 
extended to all. Running through all the 
great systems is this fundamental fact, that 
in the world none lives for himself alone, but 
each must work for all and all for each. 
This ideal of one common purpose in edu- 
cation has become the basis of the work of the 
National Bureau. By an act of Congress this 
bureau is “to collect statistics and facts show- 
ing the condition and progress of education in 
the several States and Territories, and diffuse 
such information respecting the organization 
and management of schools and school sys- 
tems and methods of teaching as shall aid the 
people of the United States in the establish- 
ment and maintenance of efficient school sys- 
tems, and otherwise promote the cause of 
education throughout the country.” 
Here we come upon a national ideal of 
education, which is to develop everywhere 
throughout the land effective methods for
-P-A-G-E-165

-producing intelligent citizens, happily related 
to their environment, and of practical service 
to the world. To this end compulsory laws to 
promote school attendance during the school 
age are recognized as a most important fea-

of education.

THE LIFE-CAREER IDEAL 
Tuar education should fit the individual to 
be a citizen has been a persistent motive from 
time immemorial. No matter how varying 
the conditions, or how unlike the standards 
of life, this element has been common to the 
educational ideals of all countries. 
As the State came to be independent of the 
Church, and passed under the influence of 
philosophy, science, and sociology, the idea of 
what constitutes citizenship was constantly 
changing in the minds of educators. So that 
in later times education has come to mean 
the fitting of an individual not only to dis- 
charge his duty to the State, but also to fulfill 
his obligation to society. 
With the beginning of the twentieth cen- 
tury there came a marvelous development in 
commerce and in the industries. Great wealth 
has been amassed both by nations and by 
individuals, and a spirit of competition has
-P-A-G-E-167
  
THE LIFE-CAREER IDEAL 155 
tended to emphasize the importance of pro- 
ductive power. The spirit of the age is com- 
mercialism. A citizen, to be of value to the 
State, must have the power to produce some- 
thing of value in the industrial world. The 
importance of a nation now depends on its - 
industrial activities, and on the number of its 
skilled individual producers. So great is the 
rivalry among nations that it has become a 
matter of necessity to modify the methods of 
education in order to have a greater number 
of productive citizens. Consequently society 
has demanded that some provision be made 
in the school curriculum for instruction along 
eminently practical lines. Efficiency is the 
crying need of the time. For many years it has 
been felt that cultural education alone could 
‘not meet the economic demands of society. 
Too much time has been taken to prepare 
a child to take his place among the world’s 
A producers. 
{7 Ta earlier days, when the question of saving 
” time was not so important an economic factor 
as now, the child was expected to receive at 
school the cultural knowledge which he could 
not elsewhere receive so well; and a system 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
of apprenticeship, outside of schools, made it 
possible fcr him to obtain a practical knowl- 
edge of the vocation which he intended to 
adopt. But with the changes in the mode of 
living; in the mad rush from rural to city life; 
in the specialization of organized labor; in the 
pressing demand for time-saving devices; in 
the rise and development of commercial in- 
dustries, there has come a perceptible decline 
in the old apprenticeship system and an in- 
crease in technical and professional schools. 
It is now seen that education for citizenship 
must include something more than mere cul- 
ture; that while it must not exclude what 
is essential to the proper development of the 
individual, it must also include that which 
shall he of direct and immediate value to 
Society. Germany was one of the first to recognize 
that industrial development and political ad- 
vancement of nations depend entirely on the 
kind of education given to children. Hence 
Germany has, for a long time, had industrial, 
trade, and technical schools. France and 
England have also responded to the general 
demand. America, because of her great nat-

ae 
THE LIFE-CAREER IDEAL 157 
ural resources, has been slow to realize the 
necessity of establishing industrial schools. 
For certain intellectual vocations, such as 
law, medicine, the ministry, and teaching, 
professional schools have long been estab- 
lished. But the vast majority of children, 
upon leaving the elementary or secondary 
schools, enter a trade or business. For this 
reason wise educators are to-day attempting 
to enlarge the horizon of such children by 
giving them an intellectual grasp of their 
chosen vocation as a whole, and a practical 
experience of the work in detail. It is with the 
hope of making children something more than 
automatic machines in a highly specialized 
business that the effort is being made to fit 
them for positions that require intelligence as 
well as manual skill. To this end vocational 
and industrial schools are now being estab- 
lished in which the cultural value of educa- 
tion is not neglected, but rather subordinated 
to the practical needs of the child’s environ- 
ment. | This is bringing about a new sense.: 
of values and a consequent readjustment in 
the curricula of schools. 
~ Vocational education, as the phrase is gen-
-P-A-G-E-170
    158 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
erally employed, means that form of training 
and instruction which leads directly to self- 
support and productive efficiency. This in- 
cludes such pursuits as the law, and other 
professions, as well as a knowledge of agri- 
- culture and of the trades. It is thus a more 
comprehensive term than industrial educa- 
tion, which is primarily designed to give in- 
struction in the trades, crafts, and manufac- 
turing industries, including such occupations 
“of girls and women as are carried on in work- 
shops. There are practically five divisions 
of vocational education: professional; agricul- 
tural; commercial or business; industrial; and 
household arts. 
(3 Because of the fact that industry has be- 
come the chief factor in determining condi- 
tions of living and working in the world, voca- 
tional education pertaining to the industries 
is, at the present time, receiving the greatest 
emphasis. 
Germany, with rare foresight, has already 
established schools that are in harmony with 
the industrial demands of the nation. They 
are systematic and comprehensive, and cover 
the entire educational period. She has also
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE LIFE-CAREER IDEAL 159 
schools which connect immediately with the 
ordinary school, and become continuation 
schools which give training to workmen; 
middle industrial schools which prepare stu- 
dents! to become foremen or assistant super- 
intendents; and higher industrial ' schools 
which correspond to the American institutes 
of technology. 
In France the industrial schools arose from 
conditions of life and of industry peculiar 
to that country. They are practically under 
Government supervision, and furnish indus- 
trial training of the broadest kind. In these 
schools there is also a distinct effort made to 
educate the artistic taste as well as to develop 
manual skill. The principle upon which the 
French vocational schools are based is that 
of intensive specialization; but, through the 
extension of university courses in France, 
extreme specialization in relation to the 
higher technical education is giving place to 
a principle of codrdination and unity. 
In England, peculiar social conditions have 
hampered the work of industrial education. 
But England has at last awakened to the fact 
that if she hopes to have any share in the great 
oe,
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
industrial markets of the world, she must 
educate skilled workmen. The field of com- 
petition between nations has assumed the 
serious proportions of a battle-field from 
which Germany has thus far carried away the 
honor of victory. England, realizing the ne- 
cessity of fostering industrial education, is 
now aiding the vocational schools by national 
subsidies. Excellent schools of textile indus- 
tries, metallurgy and mining, chemistry, and 
tropical medicine are to be found in the large 
manufacturing cities of Leeds, Sheffield, Man- 
chester, Birmingham, and Liverpool. f 
In the United States the demand for vo- 
cational education is so widespread that it is 
becoming more and more evident that indus- 
trial training must be a part of the public 
school system. 
Since the latter part of the nineteenth: 
century manual training has been taught in- 
over seven hundred American cities." But this 
work has been academic in character and cul- 
tural in its results. With the great changes 
that have taken place in the world, America 
has become essentially an industrial nation. 
Manual training has done good work in its
-P-A-G-E-173
  
  THE LIFE-CAREER IDEAL 161 
place, but it has not been able to produce 
that efficiency which is needed in the indus- 
trial world. Manufacturers are constantly in 
search of skilled labor, and,it has been a de- 
plorable fact that they have had to go to Ger- 
many for the thoroughly trained expert. The 
unprecedented industrial expansion of the last. 
few years has given an impetus to the cause of 
industrial education in America; but there is 
such a wide difference of opinion in regard to 
the methods of industrial schools that the 
whole system is still in a formative condition. 
Nevertheless, seven States have recently en- 
acted laws which will enable them to estab- 
lish industrial schools as a part of the public 
school system. Every effort is now being 
made to make the vocational aim a very 
definite thing; and to adapt education to meet 
the individual’ yequirements of pupils. The 
natural aptitude of many children leads 
them instinctively to choose certain voca- 
tions. Others are led by the influence of par- 
ents or friends, or by the inspiration of some 
ideal, to an early choice. 
In no instance have the reconstructed ideals 
of education worked such marvelous changes 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
162 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
as in the life of girls. Not many years ago it 
was deemed most improper for a girl to enter 
any employment except that of home-making 
or of teaching; now, she may enter any avenue 
in the professional and industrial world. 
At the present time the whole system of 
education in every country is a tentative 
thing. It is recognized as never before that 
education is a progressive science. That 
which served the purposes of the nineteenth 
century is antiquated for the aims of the 
twentieth. Every educational system, if it 
fulfills its function, should be adapted to time 
and place, and should properly care for the 
needs of the large majority, as well as provide 
opportunities for the favored few. Its aim 
should be to educate the masses as well as the 
classes; and under no condition should it fos- 
ter the tendency in children to enter a “blind- 
alley” calling. 
Equally important is it that parents and 
child alike should understand the value of 
a good education, even when the life - career 
ideal has become a dominant motive in the 
life. This has always been recognized to a 
large extent in the professional vocations, and
-P-A-G-E-175
THE LIFE-CAREER IDEAL 163 
has doubtless given rise to the notion that 
cultural education alone prepares for leader- 
ship. Resting on the traditions of the past, 
education has meant to the majority of people 
a means to enter the life of the leisure class 
without a vocation. There is hardly a work- 
ingman in the world who does not wish his 
children to have an easier time in life than 
he has had. For this reason there have been 
many misfits in the professional world and a 
great dearth of skilled,-cultured workmen in 
the industrial world. In the great reaction 
from this cultural education the danger is 
imminent that, in acquiring the industrial 
training demanded by the times, the idea of 
any other education will be entirely left out. 
Culture is not necessarily confined to a single 
course or group of studies in the higher in- 
stitutions; it may easily and.naturally have 
its place“in the industrial training of the ele- 
mentary and secondary schools. 
Although a man’s success in life depends 
on the choice of a’suitable vocation, his hap- 
piness also depends in a large measure on his 
manner of utilizing his leisure hours. Music, 
literature, and art should find some place, be
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
it ever so small, in his educational life, and 
enough of the sciences should be added to 
place him in right relations to the world about 
him, with some appreciation of its marvelous 
wonders. 
Thus the new ideal of education cannot be 
a fixed standard as in the old scholastic time, 
but rather a living thing containing within 
itself the power of modification and adapta- 
tion to the social and industrial conditions of 
the country and of the age. It is no longer 
a question whether education shall contain 
more or less culture, but whether it shall se- 
cure broader culture and the power to fit a 
child not only to make a living, but also to 
live a life.
-P-A-G-E-177

CONCLUSION 
Tae world has traveled a long way in three 
thousand years, yet the subject of education 
remains, and will ever remain, an unsolved 
problem. 
From the old despotic authority of tradi- 
tion, caste, and priesthood there seemed no 
possible way of escape. Man’s destiny was 
not within his own power, but a thing to be 
controlled by a higher and external force. No 
greater blight could have fallen on the human 
race than to live perpetually under the curse 
of caste. It was not without a struggle that 
the Greek nation arose to the necessity of as- 
serting the value of individual development, 
and’ posited as her contribution to human 
welfare, that true education means a harmoni- 
ous codperation of all the powers of man. The 
wsthetic idea no doubt was carried to excess 
in the effort to emphasize the “beautiful and 
good,” but the germs of lofty idealism which
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
she implanted in the human soul have ever 
since been its salvation. When the esthetic 
development of the Greek ideal assumed ab- 
normal proportions, the sturdy, practical 
common sense of the Romans came to the 
foreground. Life was not worth living to those 
forceful people unless one had a sound mind 
in a sound body, and citizenship assumed a 
dignity of manhood unknown before in the 
annals of history. 
But when the Romans were sated with con- 
quest and gave themselves up to a life of 
idleness, ease, and corruption, Christianity 
came teaching men a saving grace, that had 
power to lift them out of the mire of paganism. 
Those were the ages of faith. But, after a 
time, the Church, proud of her great achieve- 
ments, misapplied her doctrines, and stulti- 
fied the minds of the people with superstition 
and dogma. The belief, which was somewhat 
common, that the world would cease to exist 
when it reached its thousandth year, para- 
lyzed all effort; and, although there were 
many profound scholars with brilliant intel- 
lects, there was little originality of thought. 
Speech was cast in a formal and logical  
-P-A-G-E-179
CONCLUSION 167 
mould, and a spirit of asceticism prevented 
the development of a broad activity. 
Again the spirit of man burst the chains 
which bound it. The world did not come to 
an end; but, instead, great channels of adven- 
ture, invention, and knowledge opened up 
wonderful possibilities for the individual. 
Men realized that there were interests con- 
nected with this temporal life that were of 
equal value to those belonging to the other- 
world life, and the individual became a prime 
factor in the social life of the world. As a re- 
sult of this great renascence, the light, which 
philosophy shed upon the newly awakened 
world through the media of the renowned phi- 
losophers of the seventeenth century, was of 
inestimable value to the cause of education. 
Knowledge was made more practical and at- 
tractive, and suited in method and training 
to the needs of the learner. 
But when the old customs of formalism and 
insincerity enthralled both court and people, 
and it was difficult to be real, Rousseau, like 
the prophets of old, came with enthusiastic 
zeal and denunciatory fire and broke the fet- 
ters of conventionality and led the people
-P-A-G-E-180
  
  168 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
“Back to Nature.” A new -knowledge of 
childhood was born when the laws of mental 
growth were apprehended. A new era began 
in the life of the little child. At last he was to 
be understood, at last the old prophecy that 
“a little ch@d shall lead them,” was about to 
be fulfilled. The world of childhood will never 
cease to sing the praises of Pestalozzi and 
Froebel. Freedom to be and to do, expressed 
in the words “spontaneity and self-activity,” * 
has become the motto of every schoolroom. 
In this important phase of the education of 
the child, the influence of woman has played 
no little part. The ability and right of woman 
to be trained and educated as the companion 
and partner of man in the world’s work, has 
become an important element of the new 
educational ideal. 
The old Renaissance conception of the 
tight of the individual to direct his life un- 
hampered by the authority of the Church, 
has been realized in the twentieth century in 
the secularization of education. It is no longer 
a vexed question of interference by the State, 
but a universally accepted doctrine that it is 
the duty of the State to insist that every citi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
CONCLUSION 169 
zen shall have a certain amount of elementary 
education. As the masses of the industrial 
world cannot afford the means, as philan- 
thropic effort, however great, cannot supply 
sufficient funds, and as voluntary contribu- 
tions affected by religious motivés often give 
rise to bitter controversies, it is inevitable 
that this minimum instruction must be both 
compulsory and free. 
With the vast resources of a great democ- 
racy the United States has gathered up the 
ideals of the past and breathed into them the 
spirit of brotherhood and service. Educa- 
tion should create not only intelligent citizens 
but also happy ones: happy in their homes 
and happy in their usefulness. 
But a new crisis faces the world in the form 
of competition. The great army of industrial 
workers is knocking at the door of opportu- 
nity. In the fierce strife for place and gain 
there is only defeat for the inexperienced or 
inefficient youth. The cry of the masses — 
“Give us a chance” — has at last been heard 
and everywhere throughout the civilized 
world education is coming to the rescue of 
citizens and nations alike. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  170 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL * 
It is difficult to define the modern concep- 
tion of the great word education. Certain 
facts, however, have become self-evident; it 
can never be a fixed standard handed down 
from one generation to the next; it must 
always be a flexible thing, adapting itself to 
the needs of the time, place, and person; it 
must give a practical knowledge of things in 
the daily life, and not a fossilized knowledge 
of a dead past; it must elevate work through 
the worker; both must be placed upon the 
broad plane of self-respect and service; it 
must minister not only to the material wants 
of man but also to his spiritual needs; it must 
train the youth in body and mind to make 
an honorable and remunerative living; and it 
must also fit him by broad culture to become 
a worthy and noble citizen. 
The twentieth century brings no mean task 
to the modern educator. The greater the op- 
portunities the greater becomes the respon- 
sibility of training youth. ‘New occasions 
teach new duties,” and the modern concep- 
tion of education has thrust upon the edu- 
cational conscience the necessity for three 
things: a greater knowledge of the child; a
-P-A-G-E-183
CONCLUSION 171 
broader school curriculum; and a better train- 
ing for teachers. 
There are few teachers who do not daily feel 
the need of a better understanding of the phys- 
ical and psychical development of the child. 
There would be fewer “‘misunderstood”’ cases 
if the teachers and parents could detect more 
readily the signs of growth, of disease, and of 
abnormal types. Physical and mental devel- 
opment are so closely interwoven, and so 
strikingly manifest at different periods of the 
child’s life, that it is a matter of supreme 
importance now that the child should be 
guided by one who knows, at least, something 
more than the rudiments of the laws of 
growth. The knowledge of a child’s environ- 
ment, of his relations to his home, and of his 
hopes and aspiration for the future, has also 
become of inestimable value to the teacher in 
her classroom work, and in her treatment of 
the child in times of delinquency. 
With a broader conception of the scope 
of education there has been,a corresponding 
expansion of the school curriculum. This by 
no means implies that each individual is to 
study more subjects, but only such as are
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL’ 
adapted to his needs. There should be a care- 
ful distinction made between the idea of 
erudition and culture. The former may, or 
may not, be valuable, but the latter is abso- 
lutely indispensable to any pupil who hopes 
to make his way in the world. It is not a 
question as to whether a student has more 
or less knowledge of Latin or Greek, but 
whether he has a trained mind, heart, and 
hand. 
When vocational education was introduced 
as a part of the public school system, the 
necessity for vocational guidance became 
more and more apparent. There are few 
children at the age of thirteen who have any 
conception of the requirements demanded in 
the different occupations, or who know what 
is necessary to make any vocation a successful 
one for them. As a rule, every parent is anx- 
ious to have his child well-placed, but too 
often the parents’ judgment is biased by en- 
vironment, finances, or imitation; it falls then 
to the lot of the teacher to direct both parent 
and child to a judicious choice. If teachers 
are to assume such weighty responsibilities, 
it is clear that they must be trained for that
-P-A-G-E-185
  
CONCLUSION 173 
purpose. They must have accurate knowledge 
of vocational opportunities, and detailed in- 
formation in regard to the specific require- 
ments; and they must understand the peculiar 
problems of particular classes. 
In such a complex situation the question 
may fairly be asked, is it possible to form any 
ideal of education that shall have a permanent 
value? Almost unconsciously we turn back to 
the old Greek ideal, that education is a com- 
plete and harmonious development of all the 
powers of body and soul; and we realize, as 
never before, how deep the roots of modern 
civilization are embedded in Greek soil. The 
same ideal with a larger content, due to the 
influence of Christianity, is the ideal of to- 
day. \A few short decades ago, the aim of 
education was to teach the three R’s. Now 
it is seen that the aim is to include also 
the three H’s: the head, the hand, and the 
heart. \ 
\Culture, efficiency, and character must, and 
will, remain permanent elements in every 
educational ideal. The commercialism of the 
age, which says, “Come, and I will show you 
how to make more money and make it 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL 
faster,” may obscure for a time the lofty 
purpose in this eternal vision. But the day 
is hastening when both men and institutions 
will say, ““Come, and I will teach you to be 
aman.” §

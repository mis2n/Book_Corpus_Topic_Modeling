  “The University of Virginia, as a temple dedicated to science and liberty, was, after his 
[Jefferson’s] retirement from the political sphere, the object nearest his heart,and 80 con- 
tinued to the close of his life. His devotion to it was intense, and his exertions unceasing. 
It bears the stamp of his genius, and will be a noble monument of his fame. His general 
view was to make it a nursery of republican patriots, as well as genuine scholars.” (James 
Madison: Letter concerning Jefferson, November 2, 1826.) 
“Our University, the last of my mortal cares, and the last service I can render my coun- 
try.” (Jefferson to Joseph C. Cabell.) 
“Our views are catholic for the improvement of our country by science.” (Jefferson to 
George Ticknor.) 
“No man of the time threw so much solid matter into his compositions as Mr. Jefferson.” 
(Jared Sparks.) 
“No cause deserves more generous support than that of higher education in the Southern 
States.” (George William Curtis.) 
“Any one who will visit the Southern colleges and schools will find in them a generation of 
students, alert, vigorous, manly, and tremendously in earnest. It is evident that a race of 
exceptional moral earnestness and mental vigor is now growing up in the South, and that it 
is sure to be heard from.” (The Century Magazine: Topics of the Time.) 
“The University is the natural ornament and the bright consummate flower of democ- 
racy.” (Senator George F. Hoar: Address at the laying of the corner-stone of Clark 
University, Worcester, Mass., October 22, 1887.) 
The University ‘‘is an institution which better than anything else symbolizes the aim and 
tendencies of modern life.” (Bishop Spalding, at the founding of the Catholic Univer- 
sity, Washington, D. C., May 24, 1888.)

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BuREAU oF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D O., December 9, 1887. 
The Honorable Tot SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, 
Washington, D. C. 
Sir: The interest awakened by the history of the College of William 
and Mary, prepared by Dr. Herbert B. Adams, of Baltimore, and pub- 
lished by this Bureau as Circular of Information No. 1, 1887; and the 
Study of History in American Colleges and Universities, also prepared 
by Dr. Adams, and published as Circular of Information No. 2, 1887, 
justifies a further inquiry into the history of higher education in the 
State of Virginia, and in other States of the American Union. The 
work should be done gradually and methodically. Without attempting — 
to cover the entire field at once, I have thought it wise to encourage 
the preparation by Dr. Adams of a special monograph concerning 
Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia, with brief historical 
sketches of the various colleges in that State. Jefferson’s work was of 
fundamental importance in the establishment of the University of Vir- 
ginia, which is the historical successor of the College of William and 
Mary. The connection of the two institutions has been clearly traced 
by Dr. Adams in Jefferson’s projects for educational reform. The first 
idea of the University of Virginia was the proposed transformation of 
the old colonial college into something higher and broader. But this 
idea failed of realization by reason of sectarian opposition to an Epis- 
copal establishment. The present University of Virginia is an inter- 
esting illustration of the possible union of religious interests in the 
support of higher education by the State. 
Jefferson was the first conspicuous advocate in this country of cen- 
tralization in university education, and of decentralization in prepara- 
tory and common schools. He was a thorough believer in the concen- 
tration of State aid upon higher educational interests, and in the sup- 
port of primary and secondary education by local taxation and private 
philanthropy. In his judgment, local government and common schools 
should have been established together and concurrently in the State of 
Virginia. He would have subdivided the counties into “hundreds” or 
“wards,” corresponding to the militia districts, and have made the dis- 
trict school-house the place of local assembly and: primary education.

  10 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
The training of every community to good citizenship and self-help by 
active participation in local affairs, such as the support of schools, roads, 
and bridges, was the ideal of popular education in the mind of Jeffer- 
son. He proposed that the children should be taught not merely read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, and geography, but also through reading books 
the history of the world and their own country. Such an educational 
ideal, at once sound, sensible, and thoroughly democratic, is worthy 
of reconsideration after the lapse of more than a century since it was 
first proclaimed. 
Jefferson devised an ingenious plan whereby the boys of best talent, 
the sons of the people, might be discovered and sent forward, although 
poor, to preparatory colleges, and finally to the University of Virginia. 
Sucha plan is nowin practical operation in the State of New York, incon- 
nection with Cornell University, which accepted the agricultural college 
land grant upon the condition of free education to talented graduates 
of local high schools and academies, and also prevails in many other 
States, where young men receive the benefits of the higher education, 
without charge for tuition, at the State universities and agricultural 
land-grant colleges. Natural selection and the survival of the fittest 
are great needs in American schools, colleges, and universities. Jef- 
ferson’s ideas, if they should ever be realized throughout the coun- 
try, will deliver us on the one hand from the over-education of medioe- 
rity, and on the other from the under-education of genius. It is the 
duty of democracy to evolve from itself the highest talent, not only for 
government and administration, but for the advancement of science 
and the arts. 
The idea is far too prevalent that the American people have done 
their whole duty in everywhere instituting common schools by State 
authority. Popular education in this form is indeed a recognized ne- 
cessity, and, generally speaking, it'is an accomplished fact; but there is 
ahigher form of popular education, to the necessity of which the people 
asa whole have not yet risen. That form is university education in 
the interest of good government and the promotion of science in these 
United States. ‘ 
Washington had this higher form of education in mind when he said 
to Congress that “‘a flourishing state of the arts and sciences contrib- 
utes to national prosperity and reputation,” and when he advocated a 
national institution in which the primary object should be “ the educa- 
tion of our youth in the science of government.” 
Jefferson had it in mind when he was urging the State Legislature to 
establish the University of Virginia, and when he thus defined the ob- 
jects of the higher education : 
“To form the statesmen, legislators, and judges, on whom public 
prosperity and individual happiness are so much to depend; to expound 
the principles of government, the laws which regulate the intercourse 
of nations, those formed municipally for our own government, and a 
sound spirit of legislation, which, banishing all arbitrary and unneces-
-P-A-G-E-13

sary restraint on individual action, shall leave us free to do whatever 
does not violate the equal rights of another; to harmonize and promote 
the interests of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and by well- 
informed views of political economy to give a free scope to the public 
industry; to develop the reasoning faculties of our youth, enlarge their 
minds, cultivate their morals, and instil into them the precepts of vir- 
tue and order; to enlighten them with mathematical and physical 
sciences, which advance the arts and administer to the health, the sub- 
sistence, and the comforts of human life; and, finally, to ne them to 
habits of reflection and correct action, rendering them examples of 
virtue to others and of happiness within themselves. These are the 
objects of that higher grade of education, the benefits and blessings of 
which the Legislature now propose to provide for the good and orna- 
ment of their country, the gratification and happiness of their fellow- 
citizens.” 
Jefferson’s views upon the relation of the State to university educa. 
tion are so striking and so timely in these days, when some Legislatures 
are treating State universities in a grudging, short-sighted, and parsi- 
monious spirit, that I can not refrain from quoting still further from 
that remarkable report which decided the establishment of the Univer- 
sity of Virginia: 
“Some good men, and even of respectable information, consider the 
learned sciences as useless acquirements; some think they do not bet- 
ter the condition of men; and others that education, like private and 
individual concerns, should be left to private, individual effort; not 
reflecting that an establishment embracing all the sciences which may 
be useful and even necessary in the various vocations of life, with the 
buildings and apparatus belonging to each, is far beyond the reach of 
individual means, and must either derive existence from public patron- 
age, or not at all. This would leave us, then, without those callings 
which depend on education or send us to other countries to seek the 
instruction they require. * * * Nor must we omit to mention * * * 
the incalculable advantage of training up able counsellors to administer 
the affairs of our country in all its departments, legislative, executive, 
and judicial, and to bear their proper share in the councils of our 
National Government; nothing more than education advancing the 
prosperity, the power, and the happiness of a nation.” 
While the present monograph describes, for the encouragement of the 
friends of higher education, the triumph of what was called in Virginia 
the “holy cause of the University,” after nearly fifty years of arduous 
struggle by Jefferson with popular indifference and local jealousy and 
ill-advised opposition, the study is not without its interest for the 
friends of primary education, which Jefferson had quite as much at 
heart as university education. 
He believed in aiming at the highest, as did the founders of Harvard 
and William and Mary Colleges. He believed that with the opening 
of mountain sources of learning, the lower valleys and broadening plains

of popular education would the better flourish. In studying the histor- 
ical origin of the University of Virginia, we discover its connection with 
enlarged and wide-reaching ideas of a system of public education, the 
influence of which should extend far beyond the borders of a single 
State. 
In the extensive correspondence, legislative inquiries, reports of edu- 
cational commissions, and legislative enactments which led to the foun- 
dation of the University of Virginia in 1819, we have arich fund of 
suggestive ideas for the founders of educational institutions, whether 
public or private, high or low. The range of thought is from a district 
school to a national university. These ideas are all the more interest- 
ing, because the best of them are clearly the product of Jefferson’s thor- 
oughly democratic mind, enriched by higher education, by travel, and 
by an intelligent study of the best institutions of learning in the New 
and in the Old World. It is surprising to observe how Jefferson an- 
ticipated many of the modern educational ideas which have come into 
conspicuous favor since his day. For instance, non-sectarianism in uni- 
versity education; ethics and the languages of the Old and New Testa- 
ments as a suitable university basis for theological training ; the impor- 
tance of the academic study of history, politics, and economics; the 
teaching of history in common schools by means of reading-books ; the 
practical value of the modern languages; the significance of German 
studies, particularly of Anglo-Saxon; the early English origin of free 
institutions; the advantage of student self-government as a substi- . 
tute for faculty-espionage; physical education; military training of 
students; manual and industrial training; the connection of higher 
education with the higher interests of the American people. Jefferson 
seemed to recognize that our schools, colleges, and universities, if they 
are to serve efficiently the state or country in which they are placed, 
must have broad foundations, and cultivate, instead of selfish exclusive- 
ness, @ noble popularity which does honor to the Republic. 
To the University of Virginia, Jefferson’s creation, the whole country 
is indebted for the following distinguished services to the higher educa- 
tion: (1) The recognition of real university standards of instruction 
and scholarship. (2) The absolute repression of the class-system and 
the substitution of merit for seniority in the award of degrees. (3) The 
first complete introduction of the elective system. (4) The establish- 
ment of distinct “schools,” in which great subjects were grouped ; for 
example, ancient languages, modern languages, mathematics, law 
and politics ; each school having its autonomy and its own standard of 
graduation. (5) The institution of constitutional government, in ac- 
ademic form, with an appointed president or chairman of the faculty, 
holding office for one year, but eligible for reappointment by the board 
of visitors. (6) The promotion of self-government among the students, 
with the cultivation of an esprit de corps sustaining high standards of 
academic honor and scholarship.

illustrates the educational views and wide influence of the Father of the

University of Virginia, who was also one of the founders of this Re- 
public. 
The monograph contains, besides Dr. Adams’ original researches, 
an interesting and valuable study by one of his. graduate students at 
the Johns Hopkins University, Mr. William P. Trent, of Richmond, 
who earned his degree of Master of Arts at the University of Virginia, 
and who, at Dr. Adams’ suggestion, has investigated the influence of 
Jefterson’s institution upon the life and thought of the South. Mr. 
Trent has also prepared, with very great labor, statistical tables show- 
ing the various lines of public and professional activity taken by the 
alumni of the University, now widely scattered throughout the South- 
ern States. 
Following these tables is an authorized sketch of the present condi- 
tion and organization of the University, by Professor John B. Minor. A 
bibliography of the best sources of information is appended by the 
editor. Authorized sketches of Hampden-Sidney, Randolph-Macon, 
Emory and Henry, Roanoke, and Richmond Colleges, and of Washing- 
ton and Lee University, have been secured through local co-operation. 
Illustrations for the work have been obtained from a variety of sources. 
The most interesting are copies of Jefferson’s original drawings for the 
construction of the University buildings. 
This contribution to the educational history of Virginia is the first of 
a State series, which, with your approval, Dr. Adams will continue to 
edit for the Bureau of Education. The present monograph will be fol- 
lowed by historical studies of education in North Carolina, South Caro- 
lina, and Ggorgia, by student representatives of those States. 
The Bureau of Education has now in course of preparation a second 
co-operative series, on the history of higher education in Ohio, Indiana, 
Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to mark educationally the centenary 
of the first settlement of the old Northwest Territory. This plan of 
work has been undertaken with your sanction, and will be continued 
during the coming winter. 
I deem it not improper, in the conclusion of this letter, to express 
how deeply the Bureau of Education is indebted to your generous and 
liberal encouragement, in its efforts to aid and broaden the scope and 
usefulness of its work. 
In being elevated to that august tribunal which presides over one of 
the three departments of this great Union of States, you will carry with 
you the best wishes of the friends of education, and will view from a 
higher stand-point the value and beneficence of public education to the 
whole country. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
N. H. R. Dawson, 
Commissioner.

THOMAS JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF 
VIRGINIA. 
INTRODUCTION. 
“An institution,” said Emerson, “is the lengthened shadow of one 
man.” The truth of this epigrammatic saying is richly illustrated in the 
history of church, state, and society. Conspicuous examples occur in 
the founding of towns, cities, schools, colleges, and universities. There 
are many noble institutions which, if we look backward, seem to cast 
the lengthening shadows of individual influence across the valleys of 
history; but, if we look forward, such institutions are seen to be the 
advancing and growing light of the world. 
It is not enough to consider the founders of human institutions as 
‘standing apart and alone. Men should be viewed historically in their 
relation to society. Institutions are rarely the product of one man’s 
original ideas. Suggestions have usually been taken from other men 
and other institutions. There is a subtle genealogy in human creations 
which is as complex as the relations of man to society and to past gen- 
erations. Just as every individual human life is a long train of lives, 
carrying the hereditary forces of family and race—a ghostly train of 
progenitors, with their good or evil tendencies—so every human insti- 
tution is the historical resultant of many individual forces, which the 
will-power of one man or one set of men has brought into effective com- 
bination at some opportune time. 
JEFFERSON’S ALMA MATER. 
Thomas Jefferson is justly called the “Father of the University of 
Virginia.” That institution is clearly the lengthened shadow of one 
man. But William and Mary College was the alma mater of Thomas 
Jefferson. There at Williamsburg, in intimate association with a Scotch 
professor of mathematics and philosophy, with a scholarly lawyer, and 
with the Governor of the colony, Thomas Jefferson, of Albemarle, the son 
of a Virginia planter, received his first bent toward science and higher 
education, toward law and politics, the fields in which he afterward ex- 
celled. Jefferson’s first idea of a university for Virginia is inseparably 
connected with his proposed transformation of William and Mary Col- 
lege, of which, as Governor of the State, he became, ex officio, a visitor 
in 1779. The writer has already explained in his sketch of William and 
Mary College why that ancient ecclesiastical institution, the oldest of all 
15
-P-A-G-E-36

colleges in the South, and, next to Harvard, the oldest in the country, 
failed to become a State university. The present monograph will show 
how an educational germ, springing from William and Mary College, in- 
vigorated by fresh ideas from beyond the sea, and transplanted to a more 
favorable environment, developed into larger life through the fostering 
eare of Thomas Jefferson, supported by the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
Institutions like that royal old college at Williamsburg! never really 
die. They bring forth fruit in old age. Their strength is renewed, like 
the eagle’s. They transmit their life to others in ways no less remark- 
able than are the processes of nature. 
HISTORY OF WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE CONTINUED. 
This study of the early history of the University of Virginia was 
begun as a natural continuation of the history of William and Mary 
College, but it has led to a much wider view of the subject than was 
originally intended. The monograph now embraces a survey, not only 
of Jefferson’s educational work, but of the history of higher education 
throughout the State. In the latter part of his work, the author has 
received efficient co-operation from the representatives of the various 
Virginia colleges and universities. While under special obligations to 
professors and college presidents, whose names are mentioned in their 
proper connection, very particular thanks are due to the chairman of 
the faculty of the University of Virginia, Col. Charles 8, Venable, to 
the distinguished head of the law school of that institution, Professor 
John B. Minor, and to Professor B. L. Gildersleeve, of the Johns Hop- 
kins University, for the kind assistance and material information af- 
forded the present writer. 
JEFFERSON'S ORIGINAL DRAWINGS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF 
VIRGINIA, 
Grateful acknowledgments are made to Miss Sarah N. Randolph, of 
Baltimore, for placing at the service of the writer the original draw- 
ings, plans, and estimates for the University of Virginia, prepared by 
her great-grandfather, Thomas Jefferson, whose correspondence and 
papers were edited by her father, Thomas Jefferson Randolph. These 
unique illustrative materials, preserved as heirlooms by the Randolph 
family, throw a wonderful light upon the origin of the University. The 
observer realizes as never before how entirely and absolutely that 
institution was the historic product of one man’s mind. Not only 
the University itself as an academic organization, but the very 
ground-plan and structure of its buildings, every material estimate 
and every architectural detail, are the work of Thomas Jefferson. 
  
1The recent revival of William and Mary College by the Legislature of Virginia is 
a gratifying proof of popular interest in higher education and in the historical associa- 
tions of that ancient institution. The college is to become a higher training school 
for the teachers of Virginia. The superintendent of public instruction, Dr. John L, 
Buchanan, has been appointed president, and the various chairs of instruction, in- 
eluding History and English, will soon be filled anew.
-P-A-G-E-37
  
JEFFERSON'S ORIGINAL DRAWINGS. 7 
The thousand and one matters which college presidents and boards 
of trustees usually leave to professional architects and skilled labor, 
were thought out and carefully specified on paper by the “ Father of the . 
University of Virginia.” 
The student begins to appreciate the significance of the above phrase 
when he sees Jefferson’s original survey of the ground for a campus or 
lawn, and his mathematical location of the buildings, with the minutest 
directions regarding every one. Cellars and foundation walls, windows, 
doors, roofs, chimneys, floors, partitions, stairs, the very bricks and 
timber requisite for every dormitory, were all estimated with nicest ac- 
curacy. ‘The covered way in front of the whole range of buildings is 
to be Tuscan, with columns of brick rough cast, their diameter 16 inches, 
but in front of the pavilion to be arches, in order to support the col- 
umns of the portico above more solidly.” Not only did Jefferson draw 
plans and make estimates for every important feature of the University, 
but he trained his brick-makers, masons, and carpenters, and superin- 
tended every operation. He even designed tools and implements for his 
men, and taught them how to cover roofs with tin. One or two skilled 
workmen were imported from Italy to chisel the marble capitals of those 
classic columns which support the porticos of the pavilions in which 
the professors now live, but the chief work was done by home talent 
under Jefferson’s watchful eye.

ARCHITECTURAL TYPES. 
A visitor pacing slowly through those monastic colonnades extend- 
ing along two sides of the great quadrangle campus of the University 
of Virginia will receive a strange variety of impressions from the ex- 
traordinary architectural combinations which greet his wandering

eyes. The arcades themselves, from which open directly the single- 
chambered rooms of the students, remind one of cloistered walks in 
some ancient monastery. These student-rooms are like monkish cells. 
But what wonderful fagades are those which front the professors’ 
houses or pavilions! They reproduce classic styles of architecture. 
  In the Colonnade of the University, East Lawn. 
The shadows of remote antiquity are cast upon those beautiful grassy 
lawns which form the campus, or, shall we say, the campo santo, 
of the University of Virginia. From Jefferson’s drawings we learn, 
what is now well-nigh forgotten, that these varying types of classical 
architecture were copied from well-known Roman buildings, pictured 
by Palladio! in his great work on architecture. There in the theatre

minders of the baths of Diocletian, the baths of Caracalla, and of the 
temple of Fortuna Virilis. And there, at the upper or northern end of 
the quadrangle, stands the Roman Pantheon, the temple of all the 
gods, reduced to one-third of its original size, but still majestic and 
imposing. This building, with its rotunda, upon which Jefferson spent 
almost as much pains as Michael Angelo did upon the dome of St. 
Peter’s, is used for the library and for various lecture halls. Young peo- 
ple dance merrily under that stately dome at the end of the academic 
year. The young monks thus escape from their cells into the modern 
social world. How charmingly old Rome, medieval Europe, and mod- 
ern America blend together before the very eyes of young Virginia!

THE HISTORIC BACKGROUND. 
There is a manifest unity in Jefferson’s institutional creation, and yet 
a reflecting student cannot fail to see that there is an interesting histori- 
cal background to this beautiful picture. In the material structure 6f 
the University of Virginia there is much to remind the traveller of Old 
World forms, and in the documentary history of the institution itself 
there are many indications of European influence upon the mind of 
Jefferson. These things have greatly interested the present writer, 
and they may not be unworthy of the attention of friends of Ameri. 
ean educational history, in which so little work has been done, espe- 
cially in the Southern States. The formative influences which entered 
into the making of the University of Virginia are doubtless more  
-P-A-G-E-40

  numerous than those described in the following monograph ; but Jef- 
ferson was the master and controller of them all. It is no detraction 
from his individual power of origination to open the volume of his 
. large experience in the world, and to point out here and there his 
connection with men and things that shaped his purpose to its 
noble end. Instead of evolving the University of Virginia entirely 
out of his own inner consciousness, Jefferson combined, in an original 
and independent creation, the results of academic training, philosoph- 
ical culture, foreign travel, wide observation, and of an extensive corre- 
spondence with the most illustrious educators of his time. His intelli- 
_ gent study of Old World institutions prepared him to devise something 
new for Virginia and America. How the idea of one man became the 
sovereign will of the State, after a struggle of fifty years for the higher 
education, is an instructive study, affording grounds for encouragement 
in these modern days.

CHAPTER L. 
THE UNITED STATES ACADEMY AT RICHMOND. 
SURVIVAL OF FRENCH INFLUENCE. 
A very remarkable attempt was made in the latter part of the 
eighteenth century to establish the higher education in this country 
upon a grand scale. It was an attempt, growing out of the French alli- 
ance with the United States, to plant in Richmond, the new capital of 
Virginia, a kindof French academy of the arts and sciences, with branch 
academies in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. The institution 
was to be at once national and international. It was to be affiliated 
with the royal societies of London, Paris, and Brussels, and with other 
learned bodies in Europe. It was to be composed of a president, a vice- 
president, six counsellors, a treasurer-general, a secretary, a recorder, 
an agent for taking European subscriptions, French professors, masters; 
artists-in-chief attached to the academy, twenty-five resident and one 
hundred and seventy-five non-resident associates, selected from the best 
talent of the Old World and of the New. 
The academy proposed to publish yearly, from its own press in Paris, 
an almanac, announcing to the academic world not only the officers and 
students of the Richmond institution, with their distinguished asso- 
ciates, but also the work projected by the academy from year to year. 
Such work when completed was to be published in the memoirs of the 
academy and distributed to the learned societies of Europe and to the 
associates and patrons of the institution. The avademy was to show 
its active zeal for science by communicating to France and other Euro- 
pean countries a knowledge of the natural products of North America. 
The museums and cabinets of the Old World were to be enriched by 
specimens of the flora and fauna of a country as yet undiscovered by 
men of science. Experts of every class were to be sent out from Paris 
to the new academy, where they were to teach American youth, and at 
the same time serve on scientific commissions for governments, corpo- 
rations, and stock companies. These professors were to pay to the acad. 
emy, for its economic support, one-half of all receipts for instruction 
and commission work. Special stress was laid upon the importance of

introducing into America French mineralogists and mining engineers, 
If this latter idea had been realized the mineral resources of the United 
States would have been exploited in the interest of European capital. 
CHEVALIER QUESNAY’S PROJECT. 
The projector of this brilliant scheme was the Chevalier Quesnay de 
Beaurepaire, grandson of the famous French philosopher. and econ- 
omist Dr. Quesnay, who was the court physician of Louis XV. Che- 
valier Quesnay, the grandson, was one of those enthusiastic Frenchmen 
who, like La Fayette, came over to this country to aid in the war of the 
Revolution. Led on, he says in his memoir,' by the hope of achieving 
military distinction, Quesnay served as a captain in Virginia during the 
years 1777-78. A long and severe illness compelled him to give up his 
military ambition. Having occasion to travel through the country, he 
conceived the idea of improving it by the introduction of French cult- 
ure and the fine arts. He saw a good opportunity of multiplying the rela- 
tions between France and America, or, as he naively says, ‘de la lier 
avec ma patrie par de nouveaux motifs de reconnaisance, de conformité 
dans les gouts, et de communication plus intime entre les Individus des 
deux Nations.” 
The chevalier says that the first idea of founding an academy in 
America was suggested to him in 1778, by Mr. John Page, of Rosewell, 
the Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, who urged him to procure professors 
from Europe, promising to secure their appointment and make Quesnay 
president of the academy. The ambitious Frenchman appears to have 
made diligent propaganda throughout Virginia, and indeed throughout 
the country, in the interest of his novel academic idea. He even suc- 
ceeded in raising by subscription the sum of sixty thousand francs,—a 
fact which indicates that the scheme was seriously entertained. There 
is a published list of the original subscribers in Virginia, embracing 
nearly one hundred names.

est le premier qui ait adopté le projet de cet établissement ; il l’a tou- 
jours protégé depuis avec fermeté.” In order to convince the French 
public that he had the strongest social support in America, Quesnay 
referred to a great number of distinguished people in various American 
cities who had shown him encouragement. In view of the prospective 
rivalry of the Richmond Academy with old William and Mary College, 
it is interesting to find Quesnay mentioning, among his friends in Wil- 
liamsburg, “‘le Rév. M. Madison, Président de l’Université, MM. John 
& Thomas Carter; le Général Gibson.” He mentions also friends in 
Norfolk, Petersburg, Fredericksburg, and Alexandria. To Baltimoreans 
the following local patrons of liberal culture in the eighteenth century 
will not be without interest: “‘En Mariland, 4 Baltimore, M. Martin, 
Avocat-Général; M. le Docteur Buchanan (fils du feu Général de ce 
nom); M. Krocket, MM. Vanbibet, Williamson, Provayance Graves, le 
Colonel Brent, M. Hemsley, le Docteur Courter, etc.” Thus the Cheva- 
lier Quesnay proceeds in his interesting tour of social progress through 
the older cities of the Atlantic seaboard, from Baltimore to Philadelphia, 
Trenton, Elizabeth, Newark, and New York. His local lists of first

families afford an interesting criterion of the cultivated society of the 
period immediately following the American Revolution. This clever, 
diplomatic Frenchman evidently had the social entrée wherever he went 
on his academic mission. While mentioning, among his friends in New 
York, Governor Clinton, General Courtland, Mr. Duane (then mayor of 
the city), the Livingstons, Hoffmans, Halletts, Pintards, Seatons, Whites, 
and the army officers Niven, Ludlow, Ogden, Vandyke, Wool, and others, 
it is noteworthy that Quesnay speaks of General Baron von Steuben as 
“le premier de cet Etat qui ait adopté le projet” of a French academy 
_ in America. It was an educated German in New York whe first recog- 
nized the clever Frenchman’s brilliant idea. 
LETTER TO FRANKLIN. 
Quesnay’s project was clearly for something higher than an American 
college. He had in mind the highest special training of American stu- 
dents in the arts and sciences. The following extract from a letter 
written to Dr. Franklin by his daughter, Mrs. Bache, doubtless at Ques- 
nay’s request, Shows how the proposed academy was viewed by educated 
people at the time. The letter is here translated into English from 
Quesuay’s French version, published in his memoir for the sake of in- 
fluencing public opinion in France, where the name of Franklin was 
greatly revered: 
i “ PHILADELPHIA, February 27, 1783. 
“My DEAR AND HonoRED FATHER: With this letter you will re- 
ceive a project for a French academy which is‘to be established here. 
It is a very extensive plan, which will do honor to the gentleman who 
has designed it, as well as to America. If it can be executed, it will in 
no way interfere with the plans of the colleges; it will be solely for the 
completion of the education of young men after they have graduated 
from college. Those who are already under M. Quesnay have made 
great progress. 
“He regards you as the father of science in this country, and appre- 
ciates the advice and instruction which you have never failed to give 
those whose talents are worthy of recognition. Money is the one thing 
needful; but the brother of M. Quesnay, when he delivers this letter, 
will inform you how you can be most serviceable. I know well how 
occupied you must be in this important crisis; but as a mother who 
desires to give her children a useful and polite education, and who will 
be especially proud to have them trained in her own country and under 
her own eyes, I pray you to give M. Quesnay every aid and assistance 
that may lie in your power.” 
Quesnay decided to establish his academy in Richmond, because his 
earliest American associations and his best friends were in that capital. 
There he acquired, he says, a superb site for the building. His topo- 
graphical description of Richmond, with reference to the situation of 
the academy, is pleasing and graphic: ‘La position de cette ville est

charmante a tous égards, son emplacement occupe une vallée et deux 
collines, sur Pune desquelles est batie VAcadémie. La riviére de James 
forme, au pied de son enceinte, une superbe cascade, d’environ trois 
milles de longueur.” The exact site of the academy was long ago re- 
corded by Samuel Mordecai, the Richmond antiquary, who probably 
saw the building with his own eyes. He says, in his charming medley 
of Richmond history: “The site chosen by M. Quesnay, and on which 
he erected his academy, is the square on which the Monumental Church 
and the Medical College now stand, the grounds extending from those 
lower points up Broad and Marshall to Twelfth Street. The academy 
stood nearly on the spot where the Carlton House stands.” 
THE ACADEMY FOUNDED. 
The proceedings connected with the laying of the corner-stone are 
described by Quesnay, in his Memoir, and by the Virginia Gazette for 
July 1, 1786. Thefoundation was laid June 24 with masonic ceremonies 
in the presence of a great concourse of citizens. The mayor of the city, 
the French consul, and, as Quesnay reported, “ deputies of the French 
nation,”! were there to honor the occasion. With the corner-stone was 
laid a silver plate bearing this inscription, preserved in French in Ques- 
nay’s Memoir: ‘Premiére Pierre @une Académie dans la ville de 
Richemond, Alexandre-Marie Quesnay, étant Président, posée a Orient 
de Richemond, par les Maitres-Gardiens & Compagnons de la L. No. 31,

Edmund Randolph, D. P. G. Maitre.” Upon another silver plate was 
recorded the following Latin inscription, which perhaps suffered in the 
printer’s hands:

Quesnay, are mentioned in the latter’s Memoir of the academy. They 
were John Harvie, mayor of the city of Richmond, and “allié a la fa:

James McClurg; Col. Robert Goode; Dr. William Foushée; and 
Robert Boyd. Benjamin Lewis was appointed treasurer. 
Having founded and organized his Academy under the most distin- 
guished auspices, Quesnay returned to Paris, and began an active social 
and scientific propaganda in the interest of his grand project for uniting 
intellectually America and France. He cailed upon the savants of 
Paris. He visited the studios of artists. He consulted everybody 
whose opinion, good-will, or active co-operation was worth having. 
Quesnay was certainly successful in awakening the interest of the most 
influential people in the idea of establishing a French academy in Rich. 
mond. As grandson of a distinguished scholar, and as a returned sol- 
dier of France, he was able to obtain access to the highest circles. His 
project was presented to the King and Queen and to the royal family 
in a memoir published with the sanction of the royal censor. The most 
cultivated men of the time appear to have favored Quesnay’s undertak- 
ing. A commission of the Royal Academy of Science, signed by De 
la Lande, Thouin, Tenan, and Lavoisier, and certified by its secretary, 
the Marquis de Condorcet, reported favorably upon the memoir, as did 
also a similar commission of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpt- 
ure, signed by Vernet and other eminent artists. The published list 
‘of foreign associates (Associés Btrangers) of the Richmond Academy 
embraces the most distinguished French names in art, science, litera- 
ture, and politics, together with representative men of England and 
the United States. French influence naturally predominated. 
DISTINGUISHED ASSOCIATES. 
Among the celebrities whom Quesnay managed to associate with his 
Richmond Academy were Beaumarchais, secretary of the King; Con- 
dorcet and Dacier, secretaries respectively of the Royal Academies of 
Science and of Art; the Abbé de Bevi, historiographer of France ; Mar- 
quis de la Fayette, then a marshal of the armies of the King; Houdon, 
the sculptor; Malesherbes, minister of state; Lavoisier; the Comte de 
la Luzerne, minister and secretary of state; Marquis de la Luzerne, 
royal ambassador to Great Britain; Marquis de Montalenibert; the 
Due de la Rochefoucauld ; Vernet, and many others. 
Conspicuous as representatives of England and of America were Dr. 
Bancroft, of the Royal Society of London; Dr. George Buchanan, of 
Baltimore, Md., “Président de la Société Physique d’Edinbourg”; 
Thomas Paine, member of the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia ; 
Dr. Richard Price, of London; Thomas Shippen, of Philadelphia ; 
Jonathan Trumbull, who isdescribed as “ John Trombul, 4 New Haven 
état de Connecticut” ; Dr. Robert Walker, of Petersburg, Va.; Samuel 
Rutledge, of Charleston, S. C.; Benjamin West, of London, e¢ al. Of 
all the names given, the most significant to a student of American ed- 
ueational history is that of Thomas Jefferson, ‘‘ Ministre Plénipoten- 
tiaire des Etats-Unis de ?Amérique septentrionale, 4 Paris.”

DISTINGUISHED ASSOCIATES. 27 
THOMAS JEFFERSON. 
Living in Paris at this very time; and mentioned by Quesnay among 
the supporters of the proposed Academy, Jefferson must have been 
familiar with this early project for introducing the higher education of 
France into his native State. He looked upon the project with favor, 
otherwise he would not have allowed his name to be so prominently 
used in connection with Quesnay’s scheme, which was, moreover, sup- 
ported by some of the best men in Virginia. Indeed, Quesnay’s idea 
was similar to that afterwards cherished by Jefferson himself when, in 
1795, he began to correspond with George Washington about the feasi- 
bility of removing bodily to Virginiathe entire faculty of the Swiss Col- 
lege of Geneva, which was thoroughly French in its form of culture. 
In this connection it is interesting to find among the associates of the 
Richmond Academy M. Pictet, “citoyen de Gendve,” probably the 
very man with whom Jefferson afterwards corresponded with reference 
toremoval to Virginia. Jefferson himself says that he met some of these 
Swiss professors in Paris. Undoubtedly it was in that polished circle 
of learned men, within which Quesnay and Jefferson moved, that the 
latter’s ideas of university education began to take cosmopolitan form. 
His original idea of auniversity for Virginia was to develop the curric- 
ulum of his alma mater, William and Mary College; but we hear noth- 
ing more of that idea after Jefferson’s return from Paris. The idea of 
distinct schools of art and science, which is so prominent a character- 
istic of the University of Virginia to-day, is the enduring product of 
Jefferson’s observation of the schools of Paris and of his association 
and correspondence with their representative men. 
FRENCH CULTURE IN AMERICA. 
If circumstances had favored Quesnay’s project, it is probable that 
the University of Virginia would never have been founded. There 
would have been no need of it. The Academy of the United States of 
America, established at Richmond, would have become the centre of 
higher education not only for Virginia, but for the whole South, and 
possibly for a large part of the North, if the Academy had been extend- 
ed, as proposed, to the cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. 
Supported by French capital, to which in large measure we owe the 
success of our Revolutionary War, strengthened by French prestige, by 
literary, scientific, and artistic associations with Paris, then the intel- 
lectual capital of the world, the academy at Richmond might have be- 
come an educational stronghold, comparable in some degree to the Jes- 
uit influence in Canada, which has proved more lasting than French 
dominion, more impregnable than the fortress of Quebec. 
Nothing is so enduring, when once established, as forms of culture. 
If French ideas had really penetrated Virginian society, they would 
have become as dominant in the South as German ideas are now be-

coming in the State universities and school systems of the Northwest. 
French ideas survived in Virginia and in the Carolinas long after the 
Revolution, and long after the French Government had ceased to inter- 
fere in our politics. It was one of the most difficult tasks in Southern 
educational history to dislodge French philosophy from its academic 
strongholds in North and South Carolina. It was done by a strong 
current of Scotch Presbyterianism proceeding from Princeton College 
southwards. In social forms French culture lingers yet in South Caro- 
lina, notably in Charleston. 
FAILURE OF QUESNAY’S SCHEME. 
Quesnay’s scheme was not altogether chimerical; but in the year 
1788 France was in no position, financial or social, to push her educa- 
tional system into Virginia. The year Quesnay’s suggestive little tract 
was published was the year before the French Revolution, in which 
politicai maelstrom everything in France went down. If it had not 
been for one copy of Quesnay’s Memoir, picked up years afterward 
among the drift-wood of the Revolutionary period by President Andrew 
D. White, it is doubtful whether the project for a French academy in 
Richmond would have found its present place in the educational his- 
tory of Virginia. 
Provisional arrangements had been made by Quesnay in 1788, after 
a year or more of social propaganda, for instituting the following 
“schools” of advanced instruction in Virginia: foreign languages; 
mathematics; design; architecture, civil and military; painting; 
sculpture; engraving; experimental physics; astronomy; geography} 
chemistry ; mineralogy; botany; anatomy, human and veterinary; 
and natural history. The selection of suitable professors, masters, 
and artists was intrusted to a committee of correspondence estab- 
lished at Paris, and consisting of Quesnay, founder and president of 
the Academy, or of his representative; of a permanent and assistant 
secretary, a treasurer-general, and nine commissioners elected from 
prominent members of the Academy. The prospect of appointing a 
numerous faculty seems to have become darker with the approach of the 
Revolution in France. 
The committee of correspondence was organized, but when it met it 
appointed only one professor. His name was Dr. Jean Rouelle. He is 
described as a profound scholar and an experienced traveller, having a 
wide acquaintance with the natural sciences. He was elected (signifi- 
cantly enough from a French economic view) mineralogist-in-chief of 
the Richmond Academy. He was also to be professor of natural his- 
tory, chemistry, and botany, thus combining the leading natural sciences 
in one comprehensive chair. He was engaged for a term of ten years, 
and was instructed to form cabinets and collections for distribution in 
America and Europe. It was arranged that he should sail for America 
early in October, 1788; but it is doubtful whether he really went.

fe 
Quesnay’s brilliant project attracted brief admiration and then sank 
into oblivion. 
FATE OF THE RICHMOND ACADEMY, 
The building! which” he founded in Richmond was, however, com- 
pleted. It served a purpose which entitles it to a monumental place in 
  
1 Quesnay’s French Academy was early converted into a theatre, the first institu- 
tion of the kind Richmond ever had. Dramatic art found its first American recog- 
nition at Williamsburg and Annapolis; but Richmond early became one of its fa- 
vorite seats. The “Old Academy,” in Theatre Square, was destroyed by fire; but a 
new theatre was erected in the rear of the old. This new building was also burned. 
Samuel Mordecai, a contemporary observer, says this theatre was ‘the scene of the 
most horrid disaster that ever overwhelmed our city, when seventy-two persons 
perished in the flames on the fatal 26th of December, 1811, where the Monumental 
Church now stands, and its portico covers the tomb and the ashes of most of the 
victims.” This terrible holocaust and the memorial structure, piously erected upon 
the spot, will doubtless serve to remind the reader of the historic site of Quesnay’s 
academy, in the beautiful city of Richmond, which is set upon hills. 
Quesnay’s curious and interesting Mémoire concernant V Académie des Sciences 
et Beaux Arts des Etats-Unis @ Amérique, établie é Richemond, from which the above 
sketch is chiefly drawn, was first mentioned to the present writer by Mr. George 
L. Burr, instructor of history in Cornell University. Voyaging through the 
Thousand Islands, up that ancient river route by which the teachers and traders of 
France first penetrated Canada, we fell to talking of William and Mary College and 
of the educational history of Virginia, upon which the writer was then engaged. Mr. 
Burr, who had with him some of the proofs of the catalogue of the Andrew D. White 
Historical Library, now belonging to Cornell University, suddenly called to mind in 
that collection a French tract upon the Academy of Richmond. The writer’s cu- 
riosity was immediately aroused, and he begged to have the tract forwarded to Balti- 
more for examination. A careful reading of Quesnay’s Memoir proved conclusively 
that a current of French influence was beginning in the last quarter of the eighteenth 
century to penetrate Virginia. Representing science and culture rather than relig- 
ious or economic zeal, this Virginia current was different from the original French 
influence which crept into Canada by way of the St. Lawrence; and yet it is very 
interesting to note what a practical direction French science took in relation to the 
discovery of our natural resources. Not without significance was Quesnay’s casual 
suggestion of the propriety of establishing ‘‘une Chapelle pour les Catholiques Ro- 
mains épars en Virginie.” 
Samuel Mordecai, the Richmond antiquary, who must have seen in his youth the 
“Old Academy,” had access to Quesnay’s Memoirs in preparing his chapter on Rich- 
mond theatres. He says of the tract: ‘The writer is indebted to a gentleman of 
literary taste and research for the use of an exceedingly rare little volume (in French), 
entitled Memoir and Prospectus concerning the Academy of Fine Arts of the United 
States of America, Established at Richmond, the Capital of Virginia, by the Cheva- 
lier Quesnay de Beaurepaire, Founder and President.” More than a generation has 
passed away since Mordecai thus expressed his obligation to a gentleman of literary 
taste and research. The present writer can not better thank President Andrew D. 
White for the use of his copy than by repeating the words of the Richmond antiquary. 
Recent inquiry; has developed the fact that Mr. Charles Poindexter, the State libra- 
rian of Virginia, whom the writer met with Mr. Burr among the American libra- 
rians upon the river St. Lawrence, presented a copy of Quesnay’s tract some years 
ago to the State library in Richmond, and also the fact that, within a year or two, 
a.copy of the same rare little book was bought for a private library in Baltimore at 
an auction sale in the capital of Virginia,

the history of Virginia architecture. It was the place of assembly for 
the Virginia convention which, in 1788, ratified the Constitution of the 
United States. There, in the building designed to be the Academy of 
the United States of America, the statesmen of Virginia met, day after 
day, to discuss the greatest question which was ever agitated by any 
_ American academic or deliberative body since the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence. It was the question of Federal union. It was decided after 
long and earnest debate, in which such men as James Madison, John 
Marshall, James Monroe, George Wythe, Edmund Randolph, George 
Mason, Pendleton, Nicholas, Grayson, Innis, Lee, and Patrick Henry 
took their respective parts. It was, after all, a nobler national acad- 
emy than that which the Chevalier Quesnay had conceived, nobler be- 
cause it was American and not French. However admirable French 
science and the fine arts may have appeared to the Virginians at that 
time, it must be acknowledged that it was far better for their Common- 
wealth that the introduction of these excellent gifts should have been 
deferred until a later period, when Jefferson was able to give Virginia 
the ripened fruit of a long life of observation, inquiry, and reflection 
in that noble university which bears Virginia’s name.

~ CHAPTER II. 
JEFFERSON ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMON 
SCHOOLS. 
POPULAR EDUCATION AND SELF-GOVERNMENT. 
Jefferson’s ideas of university education in Virginia were closely con- 
nected with thoughts of instituting local self-government for the sup- 
port of common schools. As early as 1779 he introduced into the Gen- 
eral Assembly, among other useful measures, a bill for the more general 
diffusion of knowledge. The means proposed to accomplish this desir- 
able end was the anuual-election in every county of three so-called 
aldermen, who should proceed to divide their respective counties into 
hundreds.! This old English territorial division, which originated in 
the distribution of dand to military groups comprising one hundred set- 
tlers, of whom ten families constituted a tithing, was now suggested by 
Jefferson as a suitable territorial basis for school districts. Jefferson’s 
bill provided that the eiectors within every hundred should be called 
together to ‘‘ choose the most convenient place within their hundred for 
building a school-house.” 
Since the days of the Germanic folk-mote of armed warriors there 
has been no better object for primary assemblies of the people. In an- 
cient days freemen assembled in mass meeting to elect chieftains for 
tribal forays. Thenoisy clash of arms and the talk of war accompanied 
these local elections. In times of peace the distribution of land for . 
tillage and rules for the herding of cattle and swine occupied village 
attention. In modern days higher interests have developed in our 
agrarian communities. . The local organization and support of churches, 
the maintenance of common schools, roads, and bridges, and, more re- 
céntly, ideas of village improvement,” have come to the front in the local 
councils of American freemen.   
1 That Jefferson was not altogether unconscious of the historic sjgnificance of his 
proposed ‘‘ hundreds” is clear from a letter to a writer on the English Constitution, 
Major John Cartwright, written June 5, 1824, when the project of subdividing the 
counties into wards was again under consideration. Jefferson said the hundreds 
should be “about six miles square, and would answer to the hundreds of your Saxon 
Alfred.” 
2 Village improvement associations now flourish from Maine to Georgia. Among 
the earliest were those in Berkshire County, Mass., notably the Laurel Hill Associa- 
tion, at Stockbridge, Mass., which is well described by N. H. Egleston, in his Villages 
and Village Life.

    32 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. ‘ 
IDEA OF HISTORICAL READING IN COMMON SCHOOLS. 
[Petterson original bill in 1779 provided not only for the popular 
Oundation of common schools, but for the free training of all free chil- 
dren, male and female, for three years in reading, writing, and arithme- 
tic. (The proposed admission of girls was a step in advance of the times, 
for not until the year 1789! did Boston allow the female sex to attend 
her public schools. Most remarkable, too, was Jefferson’s idea, that. 
reading in the common schools should be made the vehicle of historical 
instruction. ] The bill enjoins that “the books which shall be used 
therein for instructing the children to read- shall be such as will at the 
same time make them acquainted with Grecian, Roman, English, and 
American history.” Jefferson elsewhere maintains that, in the common 
schools, where most children receive “ their whole education,” it should 
be “chiefly historical.” Tits was very advanced ground for an eight- 
eenth century educator; indeed, the nineteenth century is likely to 
pass away before all American teachers reach any such rational stand- 
point. 7 Jefferson regarded language simply as an instrument for attain- 
ing knowledge; and, in his opinion, a knowledge of what men have act- 
ually donein this world is a most important educational and moral force. } 
Jefferson wished to have children’s minds stored with useful historical 
facts. He said, ‘history, by apprising them of the past, will enable 
them to judge of the future; it will avail them of the experience of 
other times and other nations ; it will qualify them to act as judges of 
the actions and designs of men.” Such an historical idea of popular 
education, if introduced, not by wretched manuals, but by happily il- 
lustrated, well-selected historical reading-books, in the hands of intelli- 
gent, enthusiastic teachers, capable of telling now and then a good tale 
not in the book, would revolutionize common-school education in Amer- 
ica. The idea of making reading the avenue to intelligence has already 
begun to dawn in our modern text-books, but it was suggested more 
than a century ago by Thomas Jefferson. The idea is, however, capa- 
ble of a speciai and most useful application to the teaching of history. 
The writer has seen tried with great success the experiment of reading 
history to children in a Baltimore kindergarten, and he has great faith 
in that method for all grades of education. Jefferson proposed that a 
“general plan of reading and instruction” should be recommended by 
the College of William and Mary, and introduced by a county superin- 
tendent or county ‘‘ overseer” of education in the local hundreds. 
LATIN GRAMMAR SCHOOLS. 
Pac the common schools, according to Jefferson’s original plan, 
there were to be grammar or classical schools, where Latin, Greek, En- 
glish, geography, and higher arithmetic should be taught. The counties 
were to co-operate in local groups, from three to five or more in each 
group, for the institution of a joint grammar school or classical acad- 
1 Boston School Report, 1866, p. 28.   
 
-P-A-G-E-53
LATIN GRAMMAR SCHOOLS. 33 
emy in a convenient location, which was to be determined by the county 
overseers of the common schools, who were to appoint a visitor of the 
grammar school from each county. The board of visitors had power to 
choose their own rector, to employ masters and ushers, te fix tuition, 
etc. The College of William and Mary, again, was to have general con- 
trol of this plan of superior instruction. Thus the classical academies, 
middle schools, or colleges, as Jefferson afterwards termed them, would 
centre in the higher education, as did the common schools. 
CONNECTION OF POPULAR AND HIGHER EDUCATION. y 
[a efferson proposed to connect the three great branches of education, 
the primary, the secondary, and the higher. As stated in the bill of 
1779, and as further explained in Jefferson’s Notes on Virginia (Query 
XIV), the overseers of schools in the hundreds were to select annually. 
“the best and most promising -genius” whose parents were unable to 
afford him further education, and this “‘ boy of best genius” was to be 
sent forward to the nearest grammar school, there to be educated gratis 
for one or two years. At an annual visitation one-third of the least 
promising of these ‘public foundationers” were to be dismissed after 
one year’s instruction; the rest were to remain for a second year at 
public cost, and then all were to be dismissed or thrown on their 
own resources “ save one only, the best in genius and disposition, who 
shall be at liberty to continue there four years longer on the public 
foundation, and shall thenceforward-be deemed a senior.” Thus, in the 
twenty or more Latin schools throughout the State, a score or more of 
the brightest boys would be discovered each year. After six years’ 
public training one half of this picked number were to be dismissed 
for the supply of Latin school teachers, and the other half, of superior 
genius, were to procéed to William and Mary College for three years’ 
specialization in such sciences as they might select. Of course other 
students than the “ foundationers” could attend, at their own expense, 
either the grammar schools or the College of William and Mary. The 
above plan was suggested for the discovery and development of natu- 
ral talent among the sons of the people. By an ingenious system of 
natural selection and by the survival of the fittest, Jefferson hoped to 
secure for the service of the State the choicest products of democracy. 
By connecting the common scho Is with the academies and university, 
6 education was To be brought within     
     
on remained to the end of his life an earnest advocate of the idea of making 
the higher education accessible to the higher talent which is always latent in the 
common people. Writing to his friend Mann Page, August 30, 1795, Jefferson said: 
“I do most anxiously wish to see the highest degrees of education given to the higher 
degrees of genius, and to all degrees of it, so much as may enable them to read and 
understand what is going on in the world and to keep their part of it going on right; 
for nothing can keep it right but their own vigilant and distrustful superintendence.”

34 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
Such was the original ground-plan of Jefferson’s system of public 
education for Virginia. Although never adopted in its entirety, the 
plan served Jefferson as a basis for all subsequent educational think- 
ing. For more than forty years his mind moved along these three lines 
of institutional reform for his native State: (1) subdivision of the coun- 
ties into hundreds, wards, or townships, based on militia districts, which 
should become school districts; (2) grammar schools, classical acade- 
mies, or local colleges; (3) a State university. Of the three objects, he 
held that the first and the third were of the greatest importance to the 
State and required the highest legislative care. The second object— 
the classical academies—could be left with greater safety, he thought, 
to private enterprise and philanthropy. 
Jefferson never advocated university education at the expense of com- 
mon schools. He labored for both forms of popular instruction, although 
he always maintained that primary education should be based upon lo- 
eal taxation and self-help, with, perhaps, some assistance from county 
or State sources where local means were inadequate. As to the relative 
importance of the university and common schools for the people of Vir- 
ginia, he once said, in a letter to his friend Joseph C. Cabell, January 
18, 1823: “ Vienesgttinedsssotyal0/21y > sup eenomamealemsmaaties. or the        
    Un ity, I would rat : Db e it is safer to have — 
: eople han a in a high state of 
e@ many in ignorance. This last is the most dangerous 
state in which a nation can be. The nations and governments of Europe 
are So man proofs of it.” 
HIGHER EDUCATION THE SOURCE OF COMMON SCHOOLS. 
It is, however, a matter of historical fact that civilization began with 
the higher education of a few, and that all forms of popular culture have 
proceeded from higher sources. New England and Virginia both began 
with classical schools and colleges. Jefferson himself was compelled to 
repeat the university experiment of the Old World for the higher educa- 
tion of democracy in Virginia. In the development of popular educa- 
tion, as of popular government, there have always been recognizcd 
leaders. Neither science nor religion could have gone forth in fertilizing 
streams for the benefit of mankind unless there had been mountain 
sources above the plain. The wisdom of the Egyptians was that of ‘a 
few in a high state of science.” Moses was trained in one or more of 
those sacred colleges. In no way can we better account for the mental, 
moral, and religious improvement of the race than by recognizing the 
influence of chosen men, chosen tribes, chosen peoples, and chosen in- 
stitutions that have served to train the masses to a knowledge of higher 
things. Thecommon schools of Americasprang from sources bigher than 
themselves, from lakes far back in historic mountains, more remote and 
mysterious than were once the sources of the Nile. The history of edu- 
cation is one long stream of continuous, inexhaustible flow from such

high springs of science as the schools of Thebes, Memphis, Alexandria, 
the Greco-Roman world, and from such fountain-heads of learning as 
the Benedictine monasteries, the cathedral schools, colleges, and uni- 
versities of mediseval Europe. 
It will be disastrous for American democracy and for American edu- 
eators when they begin to level their high schools and higher education 
in the interest of what may be thought more popular and practical for 
the passing moment. ‘To level the higher education in our towns and 
States in the alleged interest of the people would be as dangerous as 
for the General Government to level the great light-houses along our 
coast and suffer our ships to depend upon the friendly rays that shine 
out from the lowly cottages of men living along the shore. This coun- 
try needs to-day all the light which scholars can afford. While every 
State should be as full of school-houses as it is of villages and hamlets, 
and as rich in local colleges and classical academies as circumstances 
may require, there will always be need of a few men and a few institu- 
tions in “a high state of science.” Universities are the light-houses of 
popular education. They show all educators on what course to steer. 
All knowledge, like all science, ‘‘ moves but slowly, slowly, creeping on 
from point to point.” 
FAILURE OF COMMON SCHOOL LAW IN 1796. 
Jefferson’s idea of introducing common schools into Virginia in con- 
nection with higher education received no attention from the Legislature 
until the year 1796, when a law was passed in the interest of the general 
education of the people. Although the merits of the measure were 
freely and warmly recognized, yet a fatal mistake was made by the 
Virginia legislators in leaving the initiation of schools for the people to 
a majority of the acting justices in each county. These justices were 
prominent, well-to-do gentlemen, but they had no inclination to tax 
themselves for the education of their poorer neighbors. Accordingly 
free schools went by default. Jefferson strongly condemned this ineffi- 
cient legislation. The State should have compelled local taxation for 
educational purposes, and not have left such a great public interest to 
local option. Jefferson returned again and again to the support of free 
schools in connection with local government and university education, 
but this grand combination of ideas found no general recognition in 
Jefferson’s life-time. 
IDEA OF LOCAL DIVISION OF COUNTIES.» 
More than one hundred years ago (1779) Thomas Jefferson declared 
for the great principles of local independence in both education and 
government. They were principles second only in importance to na- 
tional independence and colonial union. Jefferson’s political philosophy 
is summed up in the following striking extract from a private letter to 
a member of the Virginia Legislature, February 2, 1816: ‘“ Let the Na-
-P-A-G-E-56

tional Government be intrusted with the defence of the nation and its 
foreign and Federal relations; the State Governments with the civil 
rights, laws, police, and administration of what concerns the State gen- 
erally; the counties with the local concerns of the counties; and each 
ward direct the interests within itself. It is by dividing and subdivid- 
ing these republics, from the great national one down through all its 
subordinations, until it ends in the administration of every man’s farm 
and affairs by himself, by placing under every one what his own eye 
may superintend, that all will be done for the best.” 
In the same letter Jefferson declared his views with reference to the 
joint institution of local government and common schools: “ My idea 
of the mode of carrying it into execution would be this: Declare the 
county ipso facto divided into wards for the present by the boundaries 
of the militia captaincies; somebody attend the ordinary muster of 
each company, having first desired the captain to call together a full 
one. There explain the object of the law to the people of the company ; 
put to their vote whether they will have a school established, and the 
most central and convenient place for it; get them to meet and build a 
log school-house; have a roll taken of the children who would attend it 
and of those of them able to pay; these would probably be sufficient 
to support a common teacher, instructing gratis the few unable to pay. 
If there should be a deficiency, it would require too trifling a con- 
tribution from the county to be complained of, and especially as the 
whole county would participate, where necessary, in the same resource. 
Should the compat, by its vote, decide that it would have no school, 
let them remain without one.” + 
  
1 Correspondence with Jefferson and Cabell, 53, 54. Other interesting evidence of 
Jefferson’s views of the relation of local government to popularseducation may be 
found in the above Correspondence, pp. 103, 186, 413. See also Jefferson’s Writings, 
VI, 542, 566; VII, 205, 357, 358. Very suggestive upon the importance of local gov- 
ernment as a means of education for citizens are the remarks of Colonel Coles, Jef- 
ferson’s private secretary, addressed to Mr. Joseph C. Cabell, July 17, 1807. The sec- 
retary undoubtedly reflected the opinions of his chief: ‘‘Our division into counties 
is certainly much too large, and attended with a thousand inconveniences. The di- 
vision into townships or hundreds might very easily be made in Virginia, if in form- 
ing them we would follow the bounds of the militia companies, which are already 
well known and which exist in every county in the State. Each hundred should be 
a little republic within the republic of the county. Each hundred should regulate 
its own police, should have a magistrate to try warrants, etc., hold elections, at 
which the most aged and infirm might attend; should provide for its own poor; 
establish a public school, to which even the most indigent might send their chil- 
dren; should annually select a juryman who, with those selected by the differ- 
ent hundreds throughout the State, might be distributed by lot or otherwise among 
the superior and inferior courts, so as*to provide a sufficient number foreach. In 
this way the elective principle would be introduced into every department of the 
government, and an independent and impartial jury might always be had, which 
under our present system must depend entirely on the character of the marshal or 
sheriff. The people, too, of each hundred, becoming familiar with the transaction 
of business when summoned together on an occasion of emergency, would act with 
promptitude and force, which the particular character of a part of our population 
will render the more valuable.”—Correspondence of Jefferson and Cabell, p. 18.

CHARITY SCHOOLS. 37 
FIRST APPROPRIATION FOR SCHOOLS. 
In the year 1818 the first general provision for elementary education 
was made by the State of Virginia. It was agreed by the Legislature 
that $45,000 a year should be appropriated from the income of the so- 
called “literary fund” (which will be hereafter explained, for it was the 
economic basis of the University of Virginia). A radical legislative mis- 
take was made in distributing this money to the counties as an educa- 
tional bounty for the education of the poor. The county authorities 
took the money for the support of charity schools, which were supported 
in certain towns or in convenient local centres. Popular education was 
regarded in much the same pitiful light as was the care of the poor. The 
better class of people provided for their children by private schools, 
academies, and family tutors. It was an error in public policy to grant 
a State subsidy for county education. The counties should have been 
required to tax themselves. . 
Jefferson saw this error, and contended that local taxation was the 
proper basis for the support of common schools, and that State aid 
should be reserved for higher education. But he was not able to con- 
vince the men of his time of the soundness of his views. Not even a 
compromise between local taxation and State aid, which under the cir- 
cumstances would have been a wise policy, would the Virginians accept 
for their counties. Jefferson argued that wealthy planters could well 
afford to tax themselves for local education, for it would people their 
‘neighborhood with honest, useful, and enlightened citizens, under- 
standing their own rights, and firm in perpetuating them.” He said that 
the descendants of the rich would usually become poor in the third gene- 
ration, and would then find a chance of rising again through popular 
education, for which other rich men would pay. The debt of one age 
would be repaid by succeeding ages. Jefferson said in the year 1818: 
“A system of general instruction which shall reach every description 
of our citizens, from the richest to the poorest, as it was the earliest, so 
it will be the latest, of all the public concerns in which I shall permit 
myself to take an interest.” It was reserved for later times (1870) to 
begin the complete realization! of Jefferson’s generous and democratic 
ideal of education for the people. 
  
‘The rapid and gratifying progress of common school education in Virginia since the 
year 1870 is shown in the able and highly instructive reports of the superintendents 
of public instruction in that State, notably those by Dr. W. H. Ruffner, son of a for- 
mer president of Washington College, Dr. Henry Ruffner, who wrote a remarkable his_ 
tory of that institution, still in manuscript and in the keeping of the secretary and 
librarian of Washington and Lee University. .The recent history of popular educa- 
tion in Virginia is given in the reports of the present superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, Dr, John L. Buchanan, to whose courtesy as well as to that of Dr. Ruffner the 
writer is greatly indebted for documents and information. The Educational Journal 
of Virginia is a valuable collection of papers and discussions, showing a growing in- 
terest in school work, improved methods, and educational history, The reports of the 
Peabody Education Fund are also a mine of useful materials for the student of these

38 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
  JEFFERSON ON TOWNSHIP GOVERNMENT. 
Jefferson greatly admired the town governments of New England, be- 
cause of their compact, vigorous organization. He had experienced their 
energy at the time ofthe Embargo. ‘TI felt the foundations of the Goy- 
ernment shaken under my feet by the New England townships. There 
was not an individual in their States [New England] whose body was 
not thrown with all its momentum into action; and although the whole 
of the other States were known to be in favor of the measure, yet the 
organization of this little selfish minority enabled it to overrule the 
Union. What would the unwieldy counties of the Middle, the South, 
and the West do? Call a county meeting, and the drunken loungers at 
and about the court houses would have collected, the distances being 
too great for the good people and the industrious generally to attend. 
The charactér of those who really met would have been the measure of 
the weight they would have had in the scale of public opinion. As 
Cato, then, concluded every speech with the words, ‘Carthago delenda 
est,’ so do I every opinion, with the injunction, ‘Divide the counties into 
wards.’ Begin them only for a single purpose; they will soon show for 
what others they are the best instruments.” 
TOWNSHIPS IMPRACTICABLE IN RURAL VIRGINIA. 
While admiring Jefferson’s ideal of local government, one may seri- 
ously doubt its practicability in that rural and widely scattered condi- 
tion of Virginia population. The actual condition of society must 
always be taken into account when measures of social, educational, or 
administrative reform are under consideration. As a matter of fact, 
hundreds, towns, and boroughs were prominent features, on paper, in 
the early institutional history of Virginia; but the local government 
and communal life which naturally evolve with such local institutions, 
when suited to the actual wants of the people, did not and could not 
evolve in the Old Dominion. Society dispersed and sought to repro- 
duce the more or less isolated country life of the Euglish landed gen- 
try. The Virginians, if they could afford it or cared to do it, educated 
their children after the immemorial custom of Old England, by a com- 
bination of home training under competent tutors or local clergymen, 
with college training and public life. William and Mary College was 
the Oxford of Virginia. County government played in Virginia the 
same role in the political education of the people as it has always 
played in Old England. County court day and county elections were   
subjects at the South. A good summary of the educational advantages of Virginia, 
based upon Dr. Ruffner’s reports, was given in 1876 by Maj. Jedediah Hotchkiss, in 
his Virginia: A Geographical and Political Summary, which is for our time what 
Jefferson’s Notes on Virginia were for his contemporaries.

  TOWNSHIP GOVERNMENT. oo 
the Southern counterpart of Northern town meetings, as Southern court 
greens are the analogue of New England town commons. 
Each section of country developed its own interests as best it could, 
and in perfect harmony with its own environment. Communal life at 
the North had its peculiar advantages, and bore its peculiar fruits in 
common schools, libraries, lyeeums, etc. Rural life at the South was 
not without its charms, and it certainly produced its share of able men. 
Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Edmund Randolph, John Marshall, 
and Henry Clay were rural types of good citizenship. The roll of Will- 
iam and Mary College affords remarkable evidence of what Virginia pro- 
duced without town government or common schools. With them she 
might have produced something different; but the facts are sufficiently 
gratifying. Virginia remained what nature and history made her. Jef- 
ferson could not establish towns and village schools in a sparsely-settled 
country, where population had no tendency to aggregate, Bat rather to 
scatter! By the constitution of 1850 Virginia instituted districts 
within her counties for electoral and other convenient purposes; but 
there was still no proper economic basis for towns or for district schools. 
The Civil War did not improve the situation. Nevertheless, immedi- 
ately afterward, the reconstruction party sought a panacea for all evils 
by introducing the township system of New England, which was never 
really suited to the local needs of Virginia, and was less so than ever 
after the State had been a battle ground of the Republic for four 
years. It is needless to say that the institution of town government in 
a State where there was no adequate communal basis for the system 
was the height of folly and failed miserably. There was no raison 
Wétre for town government. A Northern man has only to travel in 
almost any direction across Virginia to realize how absurd it was to 
decree town government throughout regions where there were then 
notowns. The scattered population understood and naturally preferred 
their own county system, which suited their actual rural condition. 
“THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH.” 
There are, however, to-day along the line of Virginia railways, be- 
sides certain old boroughs, here and there indications of the gradual 
germination of a natural and healthful local life. With the increase of 
railroad stations, mills, and of settlements at cross-roads; with school- 
houses, churches, court-houses, and stores; with the break-up of great 
plantations and the multiplication of small farms, there will come a 
gradual increase of population and more and more of these local aggre- 
gations of society, which by and by will demand local government in 
smaller units than the county or the district. The more flourishing and

progressive localities will become incorporated as towns or villages, 
and tax themselves for schools and public improvements. In all prob- 
ability a compromise between county and town government will prove 
itself best adapted to the local wants of the South, as already has 
proved the case in the States northwest of the Ohio. Indeed, the model 
system of local government is this very compromise system, as devel- 
oped by the blending of town and county types, notably in the State 
of Mlinois.

CHAPTER III 
WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE—EUROPEAN INFLUENCES. 
SCHOLASTIC CURRICULUM. 
Interesting evidence upon Jefferson’s original idea of promoting higher 
education in Virginia is to be found in a bill for amending the constitu- 
tionof William and Mary College, proposed by the committee appointed 
in 1776 for the revision of the laws. Jefferson was a member of this com- 
mittee, and his hand is clearly to be traced in the provisions of the bill. 
After reviewing the history of the college, Jefferson describes the fac- 
ulty as consisting of ‘one school of sacred theology, with two professor- 
ships therein, to wit, one for teaching the Hebrew tongue and expound- 
ing the Holy Scriptures; and the other. for explaining the common- 
places of divinity and the controversies with heretics ; one other school 
for philosophy, with two professorships therein, to wit, one for the study 
of rhetoric, logic, and ethics, and the other of physics, metaphysics, 
and mathematics; one other school for teaching the Latin and Greek 
tongues; and one other for teaching Indian boys reading, writing, vul- 
gar arithmetic, the catechism, and the principles of the Christian relig- 
ion.” This is the clearest and fullest statement which the writer has 
thus far discovered of the actual curriculum at William and Mary Col- 
lege under the colonial régime. This fresh information will supplement 
what the writer has elsewhere? said respecting the course of study pur- 
sued at Williamsburg in early days. In general, as was surmised, the 
course resembles that given at Harvard College in the seventeenth cen- 
tury. 
. JEFFERSON’S PROPOSED CHANGES. 
Jefferson’s propositions for the modification of this ancient scholastic 
curriculum represent the first current of modern ideas, which began in 
1779, at Williamsburg, to flow into American academic life. In place of 
the president and six professors, Jefferson proposed that there should be 
eight professors, one of whom should be appointed president, with an ad- 
ditional salary of £100 a year. The eight professorships were to be as

follows: (1) Moral philosophy, the laws of nature and of nations, and 
the fine arts; (2) law and police, including economics, politics, and com- 
merce; (3) history, civil and ecclesiastical; (4) mathematics; (5) anat- 
omy and medicine; (6) natural philosophy and natural history; (7) an- 
cient languages, including Oriental (Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac) and North- 
ern tongues (Mceso-Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, Old Icelandic); (8) modern 
languages.!’ Very characteristic of Jefferson is the passage in the above 
bill respecting the Indians, a passage which is further explained in the 
Notes on Virginia (Query XV). Instead of the Indian school called 
“The Brasserton,” Jefferson proposed that the faculty should appoint 
amissionary, who should visit the Indian tribes and “investigate their 
laws, customs, religions, traditions, and more particularly their lan- 
guages, constructing grammars thereof, as well as may be, and copious 
vocabularies.” When the missionary had accomplished these pious ob. 
jects in one ‘tribe, “he might pass on to another.” The materials which 
he collected were to be deposited in the college library at Williamsburg. 
One can almost fancy that Jefferson had in mind an ethnological bureau, 
foreshadowing that developed in Washington in these latter days by 
Major Powell. 
INTRODUCTION OF MODERN STUDIES. 
Although this bill was not passed by the Legislature. nevertheless its 
provisions were, to a considerable extent, actually realized by Jefferson 
in 1779 through the board of visitors. He says in his Notes on Vir- 
ginia (Query XV) that the visitors excluded the two schools of divin- 
ity (which included the study of Hebrew); and also the school of Latin 
and Greek, chiefly because it was a mere preparatory school, which 
“filled the college with children.” Jefferson was warmly devoted to the 
classics, and, in his original bill, provided both for them and for Oriental 
languages; but it was found difficult to increase at once the chartered 
number of professorships, and Jefferson was accordingly compelled to 
change the subjects of instruction to matters of more immediate impor- 
tance to Virginia and the political training of her sons and citizens. 
Accordingly the following professorships were provided for: (1) Law 
and police (the science of administration); (2) anatomy and medicine; 
(3) physics and mathematics; (4) moral philosophy, with the law of 
nature and nations, and the fine arts; (5) modern languages; (6) the 
Indian school. Jefferson did not despair of increasing ultimately the 
original number of professorships by legislative enactment and of add- 
ing other branches of science. Here is one of his most striking sugges- 
tions: ‘‘To the professorships usually established in the universities of 
Europe it would seem proper to add one for the ancient languages and 
literatures of the north, on account of their connection with our own 
language, laws, customs, and history.” The modern idea of Germanic 
institutional and linguistic studies is here clearly foreshadowed. In- 
deed, Jefferson was the very first advocate of the study of Anglo-Saxon

in this country. The subject was early introduced at the University 
of Virginia, and Jefferson published a book upon Anglo-Saxon, which 
was reprinted in 1851. 
ROCHEFOUGAULD ON WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE.’ 
In the travels of the Duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt through the 
United States in the years 1795-97 there may be found an interesting 
account of Williamsburg and its famous old college, which had then 
fallen into decay, although it was afterwards in a measure restored. 
He says the income, which before the Revolution was from $17,000 to 
$15,000 per annum, was then reduced to $3,500. The colonial duties on 
tobacco had fallen to nothing, and the principal resources of the college 
were the rent on 20,000 acres of land, let out on long leases, and “alk 
in a state of cultivation.” A small duty on land surveys, which were 
regulated by the college, eked out its slender income, which “ the Legis- 
lature does not seem inclined to augment.” 
Rochefoucauld describes the course of study as consisting of mathe- 
matics, natural and moral philosophy, natural and civil law, with the 
modern languages. He is surprised to find the students not living in 
dormitories, “‘those vast buildings destined for their reception.” He 
says the students “are dispersed through the different boarding-houses 
in the town, at a distance from all inspection.” The duke is still more 
surprised to find Bishop Madison, the president, and the professors de- 
fending this system, and asserting that ‘it has been proved by experience 
that good order, peace, and even the success of their studies are more 
effectually promoted by this separation of the students than by their 
being united together within the same walls.” The duke is inclined to 
think that the faculty, in pursuing this policy, pay greater regard to 
their own ease than to the welfare of the young men intrusted to their 
charge. 
The French traveller notes that the students pay a fee of $14 to each 
professor whose course of lessons they follow. Board and lodging then 
cost from $100 to $120. The entire expense of a year at William and 
Mary College would amount to about $170. Besides his fees from 
students, each professor received an annual salary of $400. The presi- 
dent, who was also professor of natural and moral philosophy, received 
$200 in addition. The internal administration of the college is described 
as in the hands of the professors, under the general supervision of a 
board of eighteen visitors chosen throughout the State. The condition 
of the college building seemed to the duke “very indifferent.” The 
institution was too poor to indulge in repairs, unless aided by an ap- 
propriation from the Legislature. ‘It possesses a library tolerably well 
furnished with classical books; it consists almost entirely of old books, 
except two hundred volumes of the finest and best French productions.

sent as a present by Louis XVI at the termination of the American 
war, but which a merchant at Richmond, who was commissioned to 
forward them to the college, suffered to lie forgotten in his cellars amid 
hogsheads of sugar and casks of oil until, when at length he did for- 
ward them, they were totally spoiled. The funds of the college do not 
allow any addition to their library, which moreover is very ill kept in 
point of order and cleanliness.” 
These interesting and critical observations by an intelligent French- 
man upon the condition of William and Mary College at the close of the 
eighteenth century indicate very clearly that something better was 
needed in the way of higher education for the State of Virginia. Indeed, 
@ project was already under discussion with a view to that desirable end, 
as will appear from the following striking extract from the duke’s 
travels: ‘The Legislature of Virginia is said to entertain the design 
of founding a new college in a more central part of the State, but it is 
not known whether that of Williamsburg is to be taken as the ground- 
work of the intended establishment, or suffered to continue on its 
present footing and left to its own scanty resources, while the new 
college should be liberally endowed.” 
This information was perhaps received from Williamsburg profess- 
ors who were familiar with Jefferson’s early-cherished plan of trans- 
forming William and Mary College into a university. The reference to 
a ‘new college in a more central part of the State” is most striking, 
for it indicates that Jefferson’s novel project was already in the air. 
How that new idea evolved we shall discover in the next two chapters. 
The duke says that Bishop Madison, and Mr. Andrews, professor of 
mathematics, “did me the honours of the town with that obliging 
politeness which I have been habitually accustomed to experience in 
America. In the two days which I spent at Williamsburg they intro- 
duced me to the chief part of the society of the place, which appears 
very much united, and to consist of well-informed men. Bishop Madison 
is himself a man of considerable knowledge in natural philosophy, 
chymistry, and even polite literature. His library, much less numerous 
than that of the college, consists of a more choice selection of books, 
especially of those relating to the sciences. He annually augments his 
collection by the addition of the most esteemed scientific and new pub- 
lications. To him the public are indebted for meteorological observa- 
tions very accurately made in different parts of Virginia, and to which 
he has devoted much time.” With this pleasant picture of a Virgima 
college president of the last century, who, like President Ewell, appeared 
serene and hopeful in a trying situation, let us pass to a new chapter 
in the educational history of Virginia. 
JEFFERSON'S INTEREST IN HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Jefferson’s interest in matters pertaining to higher education was 
‘quickened by acquaintance with Quesnay’s project, by residence abroad 
from 1784 to 1789, and by a comparative study of the leading European

universities. , In 1785, one year before the founding of the French Acad- 
emy at Richmond, Jefferson was still loyal to his alma mater, and wrote 
to a young Virginian that he could do quite as well in most studies at 
William and Mary College as at foreign institutions. At that time Jef- 
ferson was inclined to favor the Italian universities, and thought Rome 
the best of all educational centres, because of its historic associations 
and its rare opportunities for art study, in which Jefferson delighted. 
In 1791 he had come to the conclusion that there was no place on the 
continent of Europe that could be compared with Geneva. Edinburgh 
and Geneva were, in his opinion, “ the two eyes of Europe.” Jefferson’s 
educational ideals were now thoroughly European. Quesnay’s project 
of introducing French academic culture into Virginia had its counter- 
part in Jefferson’s scheme to transplant the College of Geneva to Amer-

In 1794 the French faculty of that latter institution became dissatis- 
fied with their political environment, and wrote to their old friend Jef. 
ferson, whom some of the Swiss professors had met in Paris, saying that 
they were willing to come out to Virginia in a body if suitable arrange- 
ments could be made for the continuance of their academic work. Jef- 
ferson seized upou the idea at once. .It was the historical origin! of his 
project for a cosmopolitan university, to be equipped with the best sci- 
entific talent that Europe could afford. Theidea of importing a learned — 
Irishman or a sober and attentive Scotchman to be the principal of Al- 
bemarle Academy in 1783 was perhaps a germ of this larger thought, 
which had -been developed by European associations with Quesnay and 
Swiss scholars in Paris. Jefferson dreamed no longer of developing 
an ecclesiastical institution like old William and Mary College into a 
State university. He proposed now to the Virginia Legislature to make 
provision for the establishment of the Genevan college in Virginia. 
The practically-minded Virginians thought the scheme too expensive 
and too grand. Jefferson then appealed to George Washington for sup- 
port and encouragement. At that time Washington was in possession 
of certain stock in the Potomac and James River Companies, shares in 
which had been given him by the Virginia Legislature. Washington had 
accepted these shares upon the condition of his using them for a public: 
educational purpose. Jefferson now urged Washington, in a long and 
enthusiastic letter, to employ the stock given him by Virginia for the pur- 
pose of endowing university education in his native State in the form 
proposed by the Swiss College of Geneva. Washington demurred; he 
doubted the expediency of importing a body of foreign professors not 
familiar with the English language and at variance politically with the

popular party in their own land. If foreign professors were to be im- 
ported, Washington thought they should not be all from one nation. 
He said that celebrated Scotchmen might-also be obtained. By this 
wise counsel Jefferson was induced to restrain his enthusiasm, and when 
next we hear of his importing foreign professors, he had, for practical 
and conservative reasons, passed over to the English training ground of 
Oxford and Cambridge in search of candidates. 
In his letter to D’Lvernois, in discouragement of the Swiss proposi- 
tion, Jefferson unconsciously reveals the personal motive which after- 
ward made him so strenuous upon the location of the University of Vir- 
giniain his own immediate vicinity: “I should have seen with peculiar 
satisfaction the establishment of such a mass of science in my country, 
and should probably have been tempted to approach myself to it, by 
procuring a residence in its neighborhood, at those seasons of the year 
at least when the operations of agriculture are less active and inter- 
esting.”! This thought of intimate association with scientific men, a 
thought born of old associations in Williamsburg and Paris, was never 
afterward abandoned by Jefferson. He clung to the idea of introducing 
into Virginia a few representative scholars from the Old World. This 
idea grew stronger after his retirement from active politics, and after 
his settlement at Monticello for the enjoyment of a peaceful old age. 
Then the thought of himself approaching a distant academic commu- 
nity naturally gave place to the easier and pleasanter project of making 
science come to the neighborhood of Monticello. That happy realiza- 
tion of Jefferson’s dream was, however, yet a long way off. Let us con- 
' sider some further indications of the dawning idea of the University of 
Virginia as seen in his correspondence. 
DR. JOSEPH PRIESTLEY. 
In 1794 Dr. Joseph Priestley emigrated to America. He was that 
remarkable English scholar whose natural bent towards the physical 
sciences Benjamin Franklin early encouraged. He is perhaps best 
known to the scientific world by reason of his work on the History of 
Electricity, published in 1767, and his contributions to the science of 
chemistry. He discovered what was afterwards called oxygen, and he 
made the beginnings of gas analysis. Perhaps the great mass of Amer- 
icans would recognize Priestley’s merits with alacrity if they knew that 
he invented soda-water, and was a good friend of the American Colo- 
nies. The man was a scientific genius, but he was born and bred a dis- 
senter. Unfortunately, besides teaching the ancient and modern lan- 
guages, grammar, oratory, law, natural science, mathematics, and philos- 
ophy, he undertook to preach dissenting doctrines. His views were too 
liberal for the age in which he lived. Priestley was a Socinian, or Uni- 
tarian. No phase of dissent was more abominated in England at the 
close of the last century than Unitarianism. It was rivalled only in   
1 Letter dated at Monticello, February 6, 1795.

PRIESTLEY PERSECUTED IN ENGLAND. AT 
popular hatred by the French Revolution, with which Priestley sympa- 
thized. 
In 1791 Priestley was preaching in Birmingham, where he had a con- 
gregation of dissenters, and enjoyed the society of James Watt and Dr. 
Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin. The celebration of the second 
anniversary of the taking of the Bastile gave rise in Birmingham to a 
riot, which, curiously enough, spent its fury upon the houses and chap- 
elsof dissenters of various denominations. The walls of buildings in 
Birmingham were placarded with phrases like these: ‘“ Damn Priestley.” 
“No Presbyterianism.” ‘Damn the Presbyterians.” 
Although Priestley had had nothing whatever to do with the political 
celebration, the boys in the street, sons of worthy parents, shouted out, 
when they saw the inoffensive pastor and scholar: ‘‘ Damn Priestley ; 
damn him, damn him, forever, forever!” It seems almost incredible 
that less than one hundred years ago these things should have actually 
occurred in the streets of Birmingham. The facts are perfectly well au- 
thenticated. Indeed, far worse things are true. Priestley’s chapel and 
house were burned, and he and his family barely escaped from that Eng- 
lish town with their lives. His books, papers, scientific apparatus, and. 
all that he possessed were destroyed by a loyal and pious mob. Priest- 
ley bore this persecution meekly, and took refuge in the great city of Lon- 
don. There, however, even his scientific friends began to treat him with 
coldness, so that in 1794, as already stated, he emigrated! to this country, 
where he found shelter and scientific occupation in Northumberland, 
Pa.? His son-in-law, Dr. Thomas Cooper, whom Jefferson regarded as   
1Some idea of the bitterness of English feeling against Priestley may be derived 
from William Cobbett’s Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, and 
on the Several Addresses Delivered to him on his Arrival at New York. (See Porcu- 
pine’s Works, Vol. I.) Cobbett calls Priestley the “ fire-brand philosopher.” 
2 Priestley is to-day highly honored in his own land. A statue was lately erected to 
his memory, and Professor Huxley delivered the commemorative address, from which 
the above facts have been gathered. See Humboldt Library, No. 66: Technical Educa- | 
tion and other Essays; Essay on ‘‘ Joseph Priestley.” See also Priestley’s Autobiogra- 
phy, and the Life and Correspondence of Dr. Priestley, by J.T. Rutt. Priestley was 
born in 1733, near Leeds, and died, “‘ clear-headed and busy to the Iast,” at Northumber- 
land, Pa., February 6, 1804. The Encyclopedia Britannica, in its interesting article 
on Priestley, says, ‘‘ he was probably one of the very first teachers to appreciate the 
importance of physical science to early culture.” Benjamin Franklin anticipated 
Priestley in scientific studies. These two men, with Dr. Thomas Cooper and Thomas 
Jefferson, were kindred spirits. To historical students Priestley is known by his Chart 
of History, which gained him an LL. D. at Edinburgh, and by his History of the Cor- 
ruptions of Christianity, and his General History of the Christian Church to the Fall 
of the Western Empire. He wrote on the greatest variety of subjects,—history, politics, 
sociology, logic, philosophy, theology, biblical interpretation, andall the sciences of 
his time. 
Dr. Priestley’s religious writings exerted a powerful influence upon the mind of Jef- 
ferson. They were the basis of his own views, which he frequently described as 
“Unitarian.” Ina letter to John Adams, dated August 22, 1813, Jefferson said: ‘I 
have read his [Priestley’s] Corruptions of Christianity and Early Opinions of Jesus 
over and over again; and I rest on them, and on Middleton’s writings, especially his

“one of the ablest men in America,” also settled in Pennsylvania. In 
the light of the above facts, we can understand what Jefferson meant 
when he spoke of these two men as refugees “ from the fires and mobs 
of Birmingham.” 
JEFFERSON AND PRIESTLEY. 
To Dr- Priestley Jefferson wrote from Philadelphia, January 18, 1800: 
“We have in that State [Virginia] acollege (William and Mary) just 
well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a 
miserable constitution! has doomed it. It is moreover eccentric in its 
position, exposed to all bilious diseases, as all the lower country is, and 
therefore abandoned by the public care, as that part of the country 
itself is in a considerable degree by its inhabitants. We wish to es- 
tablish in the upper country, and more centrally for the State, an 
university on a plan so broad and liberal and modern, as to be worth 
patronizing with the public support, and be a temptation to the youth 
of other States to come and drink of the cup of knowledge and frater- 
nize with us. The first step is to obtain a good plan; that is, a judi- 
cious selection of the sciences, and a practicable grouping of some of 
them together, and ramifying of others, so as to adopt the professor- 
ships to our uses and our means. In an institution meant chiefly for 
use, some branches of s cience, formerly esteemed, may be now omitted ; 
so may others now valued in Europe, but useless to us for ages to come. 
As an example of the former, the Oriental learning, and of the latter, 
almost the whole of the institution proposed to Congress by the Secre- 
tary of War’s report of the 5th instant. Now there is no one to whom 
this subject is so familiar as yourself. * * * ‘To you, therefore, we 
address our solicitations, and to lessen to you as much as possible the 
ambiguities of our object, I will venture even to sketch the sciences 
which seem useful and practicable for us, as they occur to me while hold- 
ing my pen: Botany, chemistry, zodlogy, anatomy, surgery, medicine, 
natural philosophy, agriculture, mathematics, astronomy, geography, 
politics, commerce, history, ethics, law, arts, fine arts. This list is im- 
perfect? because I make it hastily, and because Iam unequal to the 
subject. * * * We should propose that the professors follow no 
other calling, so that their whole time may be given to their academical   
letters from Rome and to Waterland, as the basis of my own faith.” There would be 
much less obscurity and misunderstanding about Jefferson’s religious views if people 
would take him at his word and in the light of his relations to Priestley and Cooper. 
All three were Unitarians. 
1The strongest reason for abandoning William and Mary College is given in a letter 
to Dr. Priestley, January 27, 1800: ‘As [had proposed that William and Mary, under 
an improved form, should be the University, and that was at that time pretty highly 
Episcopal, the Dissenters after a while began to apprehend some secret design of a 
preference to that sect.” : 
2 In a subsequent letter to Dr. Priestley, Jefferson apologizes for the omission of lan- 
guages in his university scheme, and takes occasion to pay a warm tribute to classical 
culture, including Greek.

functions; and we should propose to draw from Hurope the first charac- 
ters in science, by considerable temptations, which would not need to be re- 
peated after the first set should have prepared fit successors and given 
reputation to the institution. From some splendid characters I have re- 
ceived offers most perfectly reasonable and practicable. * * * Willnot 
the arrival of Dupont tempt you to make a visit to this quarter?” 
These extracts indicate the shape which the idea of a university 
was already taking in Jefferson’s mind as early as 1800, and the in- 
fluence which Old World associations had already exerted upon him, 
In another letter to Dr. Priestley, dated Philadelphia, January 27. 
1800, Jefferson said: “I have a letter from Mr. Dupont, since his 
arrival at New York, dated the 20th, in which he says he will be in 
Philadelphia within about a fortnight from that time, but only on a 
visit. How much would it delight me if a visit from you at the same 
time were to show us two such illustrious foreigners embracing each 
other in my country, as the asylum for whatever is great and good!” 
DUPONT DE NEMOURS ON NATIONAL EDUCATION. 
One of the most interesting of Jefferson’s correspondents was the dis- 
tinguished French economist and philosopher, Dupont de Nemours. He 
was a friend of Turgot, and belonged to that group of French econo- 
mists who labored to avert the French Revolution by economic meas- 
ures. His writings upon social and philosophical subjects were influ- 
ential in their day, and are mentioned in some detail in the sketch of his 
life printed in the Biographie Générale. Dupont de Nemours was a 
member of the Assemblée des Notables, and was one ot the best types 
of educated public men under the old régime. It was his earnest and un- 
wearied endeavor to benefit society by advocating sound political econ- 
omy and popular education. He made Jefferson’s acquaintance in Paris 
before the outbreak of the Revolution, and came to this country at the 
close of the eighteenth century. He arrived in New York in January, 
1800, and soon after visited Jefferson in Philadelphia, as is indicated 
in Jefferson’s letter to Priestley above quoted. On the occasion of 
this visit it is probable that Jefferson talked over with Dupont de Ne- 
mours the general project of encouraging higher education in America. 
By this time Washington’s scheme for a national university, to be es- 
tablished in the Federal city of Washington, was generally known. He 
had announced it to Congress and had provided for it by his last will 
and testament. Men’s thoughts of higher education were beginning to 
take national scope. 
Dupont de Nemours undertook to write a treatise on National Educa- 
tion inthe United States. This work (Sur 0 Education Nationale dans les 
Btats- Unis) was written in French, and was completed June 15, 1800, at 
“Good Stay, prés New York.” The work was published at Paris, and 
the author took occasion to say that it was written in the year 1800 “a 
Ja demande de M. Jefferson, alors vice-président, et depuis président des

Etats-Unis d’Amérique; il a eu le suffrage de ce grand Magistrat et de 
son respectable successeur.”. The work went through at least two 
French editions. A copy of the second edition, which the present wri- 
ter has read with great care, bears the imprint, ‘‘ Paris, 1812,” and con- 
tains 159 small octavo pages. By a curious chance this copy was sent to - 
the author of this report by a representative of the well-known Dupont 
family, long resident at Wilmington, Del., with a request for informa- 
tion whether this treatise, written by their ancestor, had any influence 
upon the plans of Thomas Jefferson for university education in Virginia. 
The one who sent the treatise had no knowledge of the fact that the 
writer, at that very time, was investigating the origin of the University 
of Virginia; hence the acquisition seemed remarkably good luck. 
CHARACTER OF THE TREATISE. 
Dupont de Nemours’ treatise on National Education in the United 
States relates in general, as the title implies, to a general system of 
popular education for the whole country, rather than to the organiza- 
tion of a university in Virginia. The author said, indeed, that it was 
especially concerning the establishment of a university that he had been 
desired to prepare his monograph. ‘The university idea of Dupont de 
Nemours included not only the higher, but also secondary and primary 
education. In fact, his plan embraced the whole educational field, and 
was described as the University of North America. The author says 
that he is perfectly well aware of the fact that he has broken away from 
the historic constitution of universities, with their traditional faculties 
of theology, law, medicine, and philosophy. In his judgment, however, 
America and even European countries require a national system of ed- 
ucation, beginning with common schools and culminating in special, 
professional, and technical institutions. . He proposed that the city of 
Washington should be made the educational, as well as the political, 
capital ot the United States. There, he said, should be planted four 
grandes écoles; (1) a school of medicine; (2) a school of mines; (3) a 
school of social science and legislation; and (4) a school of the higher 
mathematics. To be a student of the national university in the full 
sense of that term,one must have passed through all the ascending 
grades of education, from the lowest primary to the highest special 
school or professional schools (“Un jeune homme qui aura suivi l’école 
primaire, le collége et les grandes écoles, sera un éléve de notre uni- 
versité”). 
There was to be no necessary connection between the various grandes 
écoles in Washington, save perhaps in the fact of a common establish- 
ment in one grand building devoted to a national library, a national 
museum, with offices for the ministry of public instruction, rooms for a 
philosophical society, and a botanical garden attached. The brilliant 
imagination of the French philosopher pictured this palace of education 
as one of the chief adornments of the Federal city. He would have

recommended for Washington a national university in splendor sec- 
ond only to the Capitol itself. He would have had the American peo- 
ple, instead of building royal palaces, like the Louvre, or the Tuileries, 
or the palace at Versailles, build a People’s Palace for their own higher 
education in art, science, and self-government. 
It is obvious that the scheme for national education proposed by 
Dupont de Nemours was altogether too grand for realization in a fed- 
eral republic, where the higher education was but feebly developed, 
even within the individual States. And yet, although conceived upon 
far too magnificent a scale, this broad scheme, based upon common 
schools and developing into a university system, has some general re- 
semblance to that conceived by Jefferson for the State of Virginia as 
early as 1779. It is possible, and not altogether improbable, that 
Dupont de Nemours’ treatise gave both sanction and emphasis to Jef- 
ferson’s project for a State university, composed of distinct schools for 
the most advanced instruction. The idea was not peculiar to Dupont 
de Nemours. It was originated in the schools of Paris, which formed 
the oldest university in Europe, centuries before the time of Jefferson 
and his advisers. The influence exerted by Dupont de Nemours must 
be regarded as one that strengthened and confirmed ideas already in 
Jefterson’s mind. The thought of State education was in the air. 
Alexander Hamilton grasped it in his scheme for the University of the 
State of New York, regulating to this day educational interests high 
andlow. Early in the present century the statesmen of Prussia grasped 
the same idea, and reformed a down-trodden, humiliated people by a 
system of public education which began with the lowest and led to the 
highest. 
PROFESSOR MINOR ON DUPONT DE NEMOURS. 
Professor John B. Minor, in a graphic and instructive account of the 
origin of the University of Virginia, is generously inclined to credit 
Dupont de Nemours with considerable influence upon Jefferson’s plan 
for university organization. Professor Minor says: ‘The scheme 
adopted bears a close resemblance to that of the German universities, 
but it is probable that Mr. Jefferson derived it not from that source, 
but immediately from Mons. Dupont de Nemours, a Frenchman of prom- 
inence, with whom he occasionally corresponded, and who during a so- 
journ in the United States was a frequent guest at Monticello. The 
writer has seen a manuscript translation (executed by Francis W. Gil- 
mer) of an essay written by M. Dupont de Nemours, apparently by 
special request, setting forth his opinions as to the best mode of organ- 
izing seminaries of learning in the United States, the ideas of which so 
closely coincide in some particulars with the scheme of the University 
as to exclude the supposition of a resemblance merely casual.”! Pro-

fessor Minor clearly has in mind the prominence given by bota Jeffer- 
son and his French adviser to the university system of independent 
schools, severing allegiance from the time-honored dogma that a univer- 
sity must ‘‘have its foundation in arts,” or consist of four faculties— 
theology, law, medicine, and philosophy. In this respect the French- 
man and the Virginian certainly stood upon common ground. 
PROFESSOR PICTET, OF GENEVA. 
The Dupont treatise on national education by Dupont de Nemours 
was doubtless shown to Jefferson in 1800. Three years later we find 
the latter corresponding with Professor Pictet, of the Swiss College at 
Geneva, probably the same man who had been associated with Jeffer- 
son in Quesnay’s scheme for a French academy at Richmond. In alet- 
ter dated Washington, February 5, 1803, Jefferson said, respecting Pic- 
tet’s proposed removal to Virginia: “I knew it was not safe for you to 
take such a step until it would be done on sure ground. I hoped at 
that time that.some canal shares which were at the disposal of General 
Washington might have been applied toward the establishment of a 
good seminary of learning; but he had already proceeded too far on an- 
other plan to change their direction. I have still had constantly in view 
to propose to the Legislature of Virginia the establishment of one on as 
large a scale as our present circumstances would requireor bear. But as 
yet no favorable moment has occurred. In the meanwhile I am endeay- 
oring to procure materials for a good plan. With this view I am to ask 
the favor of you to give me a sketch of the branches of science taught in 
your college, how they are distributed among the professors; that is to 
say, how many professors there are and what branches of science are al- 
lotted to each professor, and the days and hours assigned to each branch. 
Your successful experience in the distribution of business will be a valu- 
able guide to us whoare without experience. I am sensible Lam impos- 
ing on your goodness a troublesome task; but I believe every son of 
science feels a strong and disinterested desire of promoting it in every 
  
came to the writer’s attention after his own work was substantially finished, and con- 
firms, by actual knowledge and independent testimony, many of the judgments 
formed by the present writer upon documentary evidence studied at a distance from 
the University premises, The above-mentioned historical sketches relate solely to the 
University of Virginia, and were continued in monthly parts from April, 1870, until 
June, 1871. The Old Dominion Magazine was early discontinued. Professor Minor 
said to the writer in a private letter: ‘‘I suspect my copy, now somewhat dilapidated, 
is the only one extant, and it is as precious to me as an ancient MS., because Icontem- 
plate some day reprinting it in book form.” The writer made a pilgrimage to the Uni- 
versity of Virginia to get a glimpse of this work, of which no trace could be found in the 
libraries of Richmond. The University of Virginia and the ‘‘ Theatre of Marcellus ” 
proved such interesting object-lessons, that a student could really find no time to read 
books upon those premises. By the necessities of the situation he was constrained to 
borrow the precious history and to take it to Baltimore for careful examination. He 
improves this occasion to thank Mr. Minor anew for his great kindness, and to thank 
also those who dwell in the “‘ Theatre of Marcellus” for their co-operating influences.

part of te earth, and it is the consciousness as well as confidence in this 
which emboldens me to make the present request.” This isa good illus- 
tration of Jefferson’s method of acquiring information upon educational 
matters, and of his continued interest in the university idea, even when 
burdened with responsibility as President of the Federal Republic. 
JOSEPH CARRINGTON CABELL’S EUROPEAN TRAINING. 
In the year 1806 a young Virginian, returning from three years’ travel 
and study in Burope, arrived in Washington with lettérs of introduc- 
tion to Mr. Jefferson, President of the United States. This young 
man, then twenty-eight years old, was Joseph Carrington Cabell (1778- 
1856). He was a graduate of William and Mary College in the year 
1798, and afterward studied law in Williamsburg with Judge Tucker. 
Like Thomas Jefferson, Cabell was one of the finest types of liberal and 
professional culture ever graduated from that royal old college, which 
trained up many statesmen for Virginia. Like Jefferson, too, Cabell 
had experienced the liberalizing and broadening influence of Huropean 
culture. He went to Europe in 1803 for his health, which remained 
delicate throughout his entire life. Like Jefferson, again, Cabell made 
Paris the centre of his European study. He heard the lectures of Cu- 
vier and other professors at the Collége de France. He studied natural 
science at Montpellier, and sojourned at various Italian universities, 
notably at Padua, Rome, and Naples. Educational methods appear to 
have been Cabell’s as well as Jefferson’s principal object of inquiry. 
Both men conceived the same ideal of benefiting their native State by 
means of progressive ideas from Europe. Liké Jefferson, Cabell in- 
terested-himself in Swiss education. He went to Verdun and studied 
the novel system of Pestalozzi, which he afterwards endeavored to in- 
troduce into Virginia. He visited also the Universities of Leyden, Cam- 
bridge, and Oxford, and thus completed a grand tour of educational ob- 
servation. Such was the preliminary training of the man whose influ- 
ence was to become second only to that of Jefferson in founding the 
University of Virginia. This man’s work is almost unknown outside 
his native State, and it is the privilege of a student of educational 
history to point out the important connection established between Ca- 
bell and Jefferson. 
JEFFERSON AND CABELL. 
The young Virginian attracted the veteran statesman so strongly, that 
the latter offered Cabell various positions in the civil and in the diplo- 
matic service; but Cabell had lived long enough away from home. He 
was anxious to return to Virginia and to identify himself with the in- 
terests of his own people. In the year 1807 he became interested in the 
project of De la Coste, a French scientist, to establish a museum of nat- 
ural history at William and Mary College. Application was made to 
Mr. Jefferson for aid, but the project was discouraged by him. Jefferson
-P-A-G-E-74
  54 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
had now drifted far away from his alma mater. His private sgcretary, 
Col. Isaac A. Coles, wrote to Cabell, expressing, naturally, Jefferson’s 
own views, and making this important suggestion: “Ifthe amelioration 
of education and the diffusion of knowledge be the favorite objects of 
your life, avail yourself of the favorable dispositions of your country- 
men, and consent to go into our legislative body. Instead of wasting 
your time in attempting to patch up a decaying institution, direct your 
efforts toa higher and more valuable object. Found a new one, which 
shall be worthy of the first State in the Union. This may, this certainly 
will one day be done, and why not now? You may not succeed in one 
session, or in two, but you will succeed at last.” Thus, in 1807, from 
Jefferson’s own secretary came to Cabell a Declaration of Independence 
in the matter of higher education for Virginia. It was at once the as- 
sertion of a new line of educational policy, and a practical suggestion 
to an ambitious young man, able and willing to carry the university 
idea into the Virginia Legislature. 
Following the advice of his friend, Cabell went into Virginia polities. 
He: became a member of the House of Delegates in 1809, and two years 
later was elected to the State Senate, where he remained until the year 
1829, the most efficient champion of Jefferson’s three great ideas,—local 
government, popular education, and a State university. It is the sim- 
ple truth to say that, without Joseph Carrington Cabell’s persistent 
labors in the Legislature, his self-sacrifice and indomitable courage, his 
wonderful political tact and unfailing diplomacy, Jefferson’s university 
ideal would never have been realized, at least in his life-time. It was 
once publicly stated in the Virginia Senate, in 1828, that in promoting 
“that monument of wisdom,” the university, Cabell was “ second only 
to Jefferson.” 
In visiting the library of the University of Virginia, all men gaze 
with interest upon the statue of Jefferson, standing there under the 
stately dome which he so nobly planned. Few strangers, however, 
seek out that interesting portrait of Cabell which hangs upon the library 
wall. A thoughtful, kindly, yet determined face has this Virginia 
scholar, who, by good politics, founded and sustained a great university. 
Through that one man’s energy Jefferson succeeded in achieving the in- 
dependence of higher education in Virginia, and ih uniting men of all 
sects in the support of a State university.

CHAPTER IY. 
ALBEMARLE ACADEMY AND CENTRAL COLLEGE. 
JEFFERSON'S NEW PROJECT. 
In the possession of Miss Sarah N. Randolph, of Baltimore, is an 
original letter by Jefferson, dated at Annapolis, December 31, 1783, and. 
containing the first intimation of an attempt to establish an institute 
for liberal education in the vicinity of his own home. There is no ad- 
dress upon the letter, but it was evidently written to some gentleman 
in Albemarle County. A copy has been kindly made for insertion here: 
“DEAR Str: Just before I left Albemarle a proposition was started 
for establishing there a grammar school. You were so kind as to tell 
me you would write me the progress of the proposition. On my part 
I was to inquire for a tutor. To this I have not been inattentive. I 
inquired at Princeton of Dr. Witherspoon, but he informed me that 
that college was but just getting together.again, and that no such per- 
son could of course be had there. I inquired at Philadelphia for some 
literary character of the Irish nation in that city. There was none such, 
and in the course of my inquiries I was informed that learning is but 
little cultivated there, and that few persons have ever been known to 
come from that nation as tutors. I concluded on the whole, then, if 
the scheme should be carried on, and fixed on so firm a basis as that 
we might on its faith venture to bring a man from his native country, it 
would be best for me to interest some person in Scotland to engage a 
good one. From that country we are sure of having sober, attentive 
men. However, this must await your information. 
“We learn with certainty that a war in Europe is unavoidable—the 
two empires on one side and the Turks on the other. It is probable 
France and Prussia will aid the Turks; Great Britain is likely to be 
employed by Ireland. The Dutch are engaged in civil commotions, 
the object of which is the reduction of the power of the stadtholder. We 
have yet but seVen States in Congress, and nine are required to ratify the 
treaty. As the ratification should be exchanged in Paris by the 3d of 
March, this gives us greatuneasiness. Iam, with much esteem, Dear Sir, 
“Your friend and servant, TH. JEFFERSON.” 
Thus, in the greatest diplomatic crisis in our nation’s history, and in 
the midst of world-moving events, Jefferson found time to think of the

higher educational interests of his native county. The letter is most 
remarkable, not only as illustrating the condition of higher education in 
America at the close of the Revolution, but as clearly foreshadowing 
that broad educational policy which Jefferson afterwards adopted for 
the University of Virginia in securing its first professors from Europe. 
The project for an academy in Albemarle County slumbered until 
1803, when the institution was chartered by the Legislature; but it re- 
mained on paper only, until after Mr. Jefferson’s election to the board 
of trustees, March 23, 1814. From that election dates the beginning of 
the actual development process of the Albemarle Academy into the 
University of Virginia. After long years of inquiry and reflection, Jef- 
ferson had evolved in his own mind a system of higher education, of 
which William and Mary College had supplied the original germ. That 
system was now to be grafted upon Albemarle Academy and made to 
flourish under Jefferson’s own eye. 
He was present at the next meeting of the board of trustees. Peter 
Carr was chosen president, and Mr. Jefferson was made chairman of a 
committee to report a plan for raising funds. The committee reported 
within ten days; subscriptions were recommended, a lottery was pro- 
posed, and Jefferson was made chairman of a committee to petition the 
Legislature for the proceeds of the sale of certain glebe lands in Albe. 
marle County. A committee was soon appointed to select a site for 
the academy, who reported August 19, 1814, in favor of placing the 
academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, and presented a 
plan for improving the site. In all probability this plan was drawn by 
Jefferson, who certainly prepared the ground-plan of Central College, 
which became the University of Virginia. Albemarle Academy, al- 
. though it existed only on paper, is important historically, for it was the 
legal foundation of those two higher institutions, and the immediate 
occasion of the educational correspondence with Dr. Thomas Cooper 
and Peter Carr. 
DR. THOMAS COOPER. 
Dr. Thomas Cooper was an Englishman by birth and the son-in-law 
of Dr. Priestley, the English philosopher. With him Cooper came 
ont to America, and found refuge from political and religious persecu- 
tion in the State of Pennsylvania.!. Both were liberals in politics and 
in religion. Cooper edited his father-in-law’s writings and acquired 
the reputation of being a Unitarian, which greatly impeded his scien- 
tific career in this country. The man was well versed in the natural 
sciences, particularly in chemistry, physics, and physiology. To all 
the excellence of scientific training and a well-rounded university cult-   
1 Jefferson mentions Priestley and Cooper in a letter to Tench Coxe, dated Monticello, 
May 1, 1794: “I am sorry Mr. Cooper and Priestley did not take a more general sur- 
vey of our country before they fixed themselves. I think they might have promoted 
' their own advantage by it, and have aided the introduction of improvement where 
it is more wanting.”

ure, he added a special aptitude for the law and for political science. 
He was one of the earliest writers in this country upon the subject of 
political economy, and he was absolutely the first to introduce the study 
of Roman law by his edition of Justinian,! with analogies and contrasts.   
1Upon inquiry at the University of Virginia, the writer learned from Professor 
Minor, the head of the law department, that he owned a copy of Cooper’s work 
on Roman law. Amid the varied interests attending the writer’s hurried visit he 
neglected to note the,exact title of Cooper’s work. He owes the following informa- 
tion to the courtesy of Mr. Minor: 
“Law DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, 
“* December 1, 1887. 
“In pursuance of yours of 30th ultimo, received this morning, I inclose a copy of 
the title-page of Cooper’s Institutes, with the number of pages covering each part of 
the contents, showing also that the volume is ordinary law octavo. It contains 
nothing but Tribonian’s elementary exposition of the leading principles of the intended 
Corpus Juris Civilis, and especially of that part known as the Pandects or Digest. The 
English translation of Dr. Cooper is ranged side by side with Justinian’s Latin text ; 
so that the latter alone would embrace about 250 octavo pages. Cooper’s translation. 
is founded upon that of Harris, and differs from it only in occasionally employing a 
more condensed expression. His notes owe very little to Harris, and in the main ap- 
pear to me, who am only a sciolist in the Roman law, judicious and instructive. It 
is certainly remarkable that in England, as well as with us, the study of Roman juris- 
prudence should have been so slowly introduced amongst the professors of the com- 
mon law; and especially as amongst the practitioners in the ecclesiastical courts an 
the courts of admiralty a familiar acquaintance with it had been cultivated from the 
time of Stephen, in the eleventh century. Lord Mansfield seems to have stood alone, 
amongst the frequenters of Westminster Hall, in his knowledge of Roman law, and 
Judge Story and Chancellor Kent pretty much monopolized it in the United States 
until comparatively a few years ago. I suppose its being the basis of the law of 
Louisiana may have given some impulse to the more recent tendency to study it.- In 
1845 Makelday’s Compendium of Modern Civil Law, edited by Kaufmann, was pub- 
lished in New York, but I have the impression that its circulation was very limited ; 
and to this day with us the acquaintance with the Corpus Juris Civilis and with the. 
commentators is confined within the narrowest limits.”

A copy of the original edition of Cooper’s Institutes of Justinian, prepared when 
Cooper was professor of chemistry at Carlisle, Pa., and published at Philadelphia, 
1812, was presented to the writer of this report by one of his students from Penn-

fessor Minor.

between the English and the Roman law—a work which led Jefferson 
to propose a history of the common law and the study of historical 
jurisprudence.! Cooper was driven to the practice of law as a livelihood 
in Pennsylvania, and rose to the position of a judge. Hence he is fre- 
quently mentioned in Jefferson’s correspondence as Judge Cooper, 
although more usually known in American educational history as Dr. 
Cooper. He was fora time professor in Dickinson College, and was after- 
  
1 Jefferson anticipated some of the modern tendencies of legal education. Very in- 
teresting views with reference to historical jurisprudence and a proper course of legal 
study are to be found in his letter to Cooper, dated January 16, 1814, and in his ad- 
vice to Dabney Terrell, February 26, 1821. (See Works, VII, 206, 209, 382,414.) Jef- 
ferson’s views in regard to the subject of law were as advanced as his views of edu- 
cation. As early as the time of the Revolution he attempted to put the laws of Vir- 
ginia into simple, straightforward, intelligible English. He once said to Cabell, Sep- 
tember 9, 1817: ‘‘I dislike the verbose and intricate style of the modern English 
statutes, and in our revised code I endeavored to restore it to the simple one of the 
ancient statutes, in such original billsas I drew in that work. I suppose the reform- 
ation has not been acceptable, as it has been little followed.” 
A valuable article on “Thomas Jefferson as a Legislator” was published in the Vir- 
_ginia Law Journal for December, 1887, by R. G. Kean, Esq. He says that the influence 
of Jefferson in the reformation of the fautological style of legal expression made itself 
felt in the Virginia code of 1849, prepared by the late Conway Robinson and John M. 
Patton, The laws of Virginia, as revised by Jefferson, Wythe, [and Pendleton, ] were 
reported in one hundred and twenty-six bills, all embraced within ninety folio pages. 
Bills for a system of public education and a bill prohibiting the slave trade were among 
these proposed laws. Among them, also, was the famous statute establishing religious 
freedom, passed August 13, 1786, when Jefferson was in Paris. It excited great in- 
terest in Europe among diplomatic circles and was inserted in the Encyclopédie. 
The criminal law was wonderfully improved by Jefferson. He eliminated the barbar- 
ous‘features of English penal law, and reduced the cases requiring the death penalty 
from twenty-nine to two,— treason and murder. This portion of Jefferson’s work as a 
legislator is remarkable for his citations from the original Anglo-Saxon laws (see 
Works, IV, 146), 
In regard to slavery, Jefferson and his fellow commissioners not only reported a bill 
prohibiting the further importation of slaves (which was one of the first laws passed, 
1778; see Hening, IX, 471), but were prepared to report in favor of emancipation 
-of all of slave descent born after the passage of the act just named; but the public 
mind would not bear the proposition then, “ nor will it bear it even at this day,” said 
Jefferson in his memoir in 1821. ‘‘ Yet the day is not distant when it must bear it and 
adopt it, or worse will follow. Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate 
than that these people are to be free.” There is an interesting letter on abolition in 
Jefferson’s Works, VII, 408. Jefferson prepared statutes which swept away the Eng- 
lish laws of entail and primogeniture, with every vestige of feudalism. So perfect 
was his statute of descents that “in the experience of a completed century but one 
-single doubt as to the construction and effect of any part of it has arisen, That single 
-doubt was resolved by the case of Davis v. Rowe, 6 Randolph, 355,” Even that case, 
itis said, was decided by principles contained in the original act. 
The above statement is condensed from Mr. Kean’s interesting and suggestive ar- 
ticle. Similar views are expressed in 2 Minor’s Institutes (3d ed.), pp. 467-470, 
531-534, and in 1 Zd.,6. Upon Jefferson’s favorite idea of gradual emancipation, 
which would have been good statesmanship and good economy for the South, see 
Madison’s Writings, III, 133 et seq., and IV, 274. There is an article by A. D, White 
-on “‘ Jefferson and Slavery” in the Atlantic Monthly, Vol. IX, 1862, p. 29.

THOMAS COOPER. Do: 
wards a lecturer in the University of Pennsylvania. His connection with 
the University of Virginia and with South Carolina College, where he 
was the immediate predecessor of Francis Lieber, will be described in 
other connections. 
Cooper is mentioned in Jefferson’s first published letter to his friend, 
Joseph ©. Cabell, June 27, 1810, in a most graphic way: ‘I enclose you 
a letter from Judge Cooper, of Pennsylvania, a political refugee with 
Dr. Priestley from the fires and mobs of Birmingham. | He is one of the 
ablest men in America, and that in several branches of science. The 
Jaw opinion which he mentions I have received, and a more luminous 
one has not been seen. The best pieces on political economy which 
have been written in this country were by Cooper. Heisa great chem- 
ist, and now proposes to resume his mineralogical studies on this sub- 
ject ; you will perceive that he wishes a correspondent in our State. L 
know of nobody to whom I can so advantageously commit him as to 
yourself.” Although Cabell was unwilling, from his connection with 
politics, to revert to mineralogical studies once pursued in France and 
Switzerland, yet Jefferson continued to correspond with Cooper, who 
gave him much practical advice representing English university ex- 
perience. The importance of this advice to Jefferson may be suggested 
by the fact that Cooper was the first chosen professor of natural sci- 
ence and law in the University of Virginia, and that his opinion was 
courted with reference to filling the chair of language and history. 
JEFFERSON’S CORRESPONDENCE WITH COOPER. 
It is interesting to observe that Jefferson’s educational inquiries of 
Dr. Cooper begin to have a local and definite significance just before 
the attempted revival of Albemarle Academy, and that the correspond- 
ence proceeds upon that local basis of university education. On the 
16th of January, 1814, Jefferson wrote to Cooper: 
“T have long had under contemplation, and been collecting materials 
for the plan of an university in Virginia which should comprehend all 
the sciences useful to us, and none others. The general idea is sug- 
gested in the Notes on Virginia, Qu. 14. This would probably absorb 
the functions of William and Mary College, and transfer them toa 
healthier and more central position: perhaps to the neighborhood of this 
place. The long and lingering decline of William and Mary, the death 
of its last president [Bishop Madison], its location and climate, force on 
us the wish for a new institution more convenient to our country gen- 
erally, and better adapted to the present state of science. I have been 
told there will be an effort in the present session of our Legislature to 
effect such an establishment. J confess, however, that I have not great 
confidence that this will be done. Should it happen, it would offer 
places worthy of you, and of which you are worthy. It might produce, 
too, a bidder for the apparatus and library of Dr. Priestley, to which 
they might add mine on their own terms. This consists of about seven

  60 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, 
or eight thousand volumes, the best chosen collection of its size prob- 
ably in America, and containing a great mass of what is most rare and 
valuable, and especially what relates to America.”? 
A few mouths later, August 25, 1814, Jefferson again writes to Dr. 
Cooper, from Monticello, concerning the project for a university, and 
asks advice respecting the courses of study: “ In my letter of January 
16th, I mentioned to you that it had long been in contemplation to get 
a university established in this State, in which all the branches of sci- 
ence useful to us, and at this day, should be taught in their highest de- 
gree, and that this institution should be incorporated with the college 
and funds of William and Mary. But what are the sciences useful to 
us, and at this day thought useful to anybody? A glance over Bacon’s 
arbor scientie will show the foundation for this question, and how many 
of his ramifications of science are now lopt off as nugatory. To be 
prepared for this new establishment, I have taken some pains to ascer- 
tain those branches which men of sense, as well as of science, deem 
worthy of cultivation. To the statements which I have obtained from 
other sources, I should highly value an addition of one from yourself. 
You know our country, its pursuits, its faculties, its relations with 
others, its means of establishing and maintaining an institution of gen- 
eral science, and the spirit of economy with which it requires that these 
should be administered. Will you, then, so far contribute to our views 
as to consider this subject, to make a statement of the branches of sci- 
ence which you think worthy of being taught, as I have before said, at 
this day and in this country? But to accommodate them to our econ- 
omy, it will be necessary further to distribute them into groups, each 
group comprehending as many branches as one industrious professor 
may competently teach, and, as much as may be, a duly associated fam- 
ily or class of kindred sciences. The object of this is to bring the 
whole circle of useful science under the direction of the smallest num- 
ber of professors possible, and that our means may be so frugally em- 
ployed as to effect the greatest possible good. We are about to make 
an effort for the introduction of this institution.”? i 
On the 10th of September, but little more than a fortnight after the 
“letter to Dr. Cooper, quoted above, Jefferson addressed him again in 
language indicating that his plan was ripening fast: 
“T regret much that I was so late in consulting you on the subject of 
the academy we wish to establish here. The progress of that business 
has obliged me to prepare an address to the president of the board of 
trustees—a plan for its organization. I send you a copy of it with a 
broad margin, that, if your answer to mine of August 25th be not on 
the way, you may be so good as to write your suggestions either in the 
margin or on a separate paper. We shall still be able to avail ourselves 
of them by way of amendments.”

JEFFERSON'S EDUCATIONAL VIEWS. 61 
LETTER TO PETER CARR. 
The address to the president of the board of trustees of Albemarle 
Academy, of which a copy was submitted by Jefferson to Dr. Cooper 
for further suggestions, was a letter to Peter Carr, dated Monticello, 
September 7, 1814. It is the most important document in the early his- 
tory of the University of Virginia, for it defines Jefferson’s educational 
views as matured after more than thirty years of reflection, from the 
time when he first draughted a bill for the more general diffusion of knowl- 
edge. The letter! was originally printed in the Richmond Enquirer for 
the purpose of popularizing Jefferson’s views. It was reprinted in 
1817 in a pamphlet called ‘Sundry Documents on the Subject of a Sys- 
tem of Public Education for the State of Virginia,” which is absolutely 
the oldest and most original collection of materials upon the origin of 
the University. It is also reprinted in the appendix to the published 
letters of Jefferson and Cabell. This letter to Carr not only contains 
the plan of organization for the academy mentioned in Jefferson’s letter 
to Dr. Cooper, but it suggests the possibility of expanding that institu- 
tion into a college, with professional schools. Jefferson’s inquiries and 
his general plan of organization appear to have elicited three letters 
of comment from Dr. Cooper, written in quick succession, September 
15, 21, and 22, but all arriving at Monticello in the same mail. The 
first of these letters Jefferson returned to Cooper, who wished to pub- 
lish it in the Portfolio, “It will give our young men,” said Jefferson,” 
“some idea of what constitutes an educated man.” With Cooper’s 
views that “a professorship of theology should have no place in our insti- 
tution,” Jefferson quite agreed, although he included it in his original 
plan as communicated to Peter Carr. 
The following extracts and summary of the letter, which may be 
ealled the literary foundation of the University of Virginia, will not 
be without general interest to students of American educational history: 
“ On the subject of the academy or college proposed to be established 
in our neighborhood, I promised the trustees that I would prepare for 
them a plan, adapted, in the first instance, to our slender funds, but 
susceptible of being enlarged, either by their own growth, or by acces- 
sion from other quarters. I have long entertained the hope that this, 
our native State, would take up the subject of education, and make an 
establishment, either with or without incorporation into that of William 
and Mary, where every branch of science, deemed useful at this day, 
should be taught in its highest degree. With this view, I have lost no 
occasion of making myself acquainted with the organization of the best 
seminaries in other countries, and with the opinions of the most en- 
lightened individuals on the subject of the sciences worthy of a place   
‘It appeared in Niles’s Register, March 16, 1816. 
2 Jefferson’s reply, October 7, 1814, to Dr. Cooper’s comments appears to have been 
used by the former, together with the letter to Peter Carr and other documents, for 
university propaganda, See Correspondence with Joseph C, Cabell, pp. 36, 37.

  62 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
in such an institution. In order to prepare what I had promised our 
trustees I have lately revised these several plans with attention; and 
I am struck with the diversity of arrangement observable in them, no 
two being alike. Yet Ihave no doubt that these several arrangements 
have been the subject of mature reflection by wise and learned men, 
who, contemplating local circumstances, have adapted them to the con- 
dition of the section of society for which they have been framed. Iam 
strengthened in this conclusion by an examination of each separately, 
and a conviction that no one of them, if adopted without change, would 
be suited to the circumstances and pursuit of our country. The ex- 
ample they have set, then, is authority for us to select from their dif- 
ferent institutions the materials which are good for us, and, with them, 
to erect a structure whose arrangement shall correspond with our own 
social condition, and shall admit of enlargement in proportion to the 
encouragement it may merit and receive.” 
GENERAL VIEW OF EDUCATION. 
After this sensible introduction, which contains a wholesome warning 
against mere imitation in educational establishments and a proper rec- 
ognition of peculiar local conditions in every individual foundation, Jef- 
ferson proceeds to survey the general field of education and to mark out 
_that particular portion to be occupied by the proposed institution in his. 
immediate neighborhood. He considers the subject under three heads: 
elementary schools, general schools, and professional schools. Under 
the first head he observes that it is the duty of § government to see that 
every citizen is” educated according to his condition ant | pursuits in 
life. He divides the mass of citizens into the laboring and the learned 
‘classes, including under the former agricultural labor and handicrafts, 
and under the latter certain skilled labor and technical knowled ge. 
Elementary schools will suffice for the laboring classes. Jefferson notes 
the fact that a plan was once proposed to the Legislature of Virginia to 
divide every county into hundreds or wards, five or six miles square, each 
ward to have its own schools, for the elementary education of the chil- 
dren in reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography. He expresses the 
hope that this project, once ineffectually attempted, may be resumed 
“in a more promising form.” Passing to the second head, Jefferson re- 
marks that pupils leaving the elementary schools will separate into two 
classes, for the pursuit of labor and science, respectively. Pupils des- 
tined for the latter will go to college, where higher education is afforded 
by general schools and is specialized in professional schools. The 
learned class he divides into two sections: first, those destined for pro- 
fessional life ; and second, the wealthy, who “ may aspire to share in 
conducting the affairs of the nation, or live with usefulness and respect 
in the private ranks of life.” Both the learned and the wealthy will 
require the higher education, but the former will need to specialize and 
pass from the general to professional schools,
-P-A-G-E-85
  JEFFERSON'S EDUCATIONAL VIEWS. 63 
CLASSIFICATION OF THE SCIENCES. 
Jefferson then attempts to classify the branches of useful science, 
which ought to be taught in the generalschools. He groups them under 
three departments: language, mathematics, and philosophy. In the 
first department he arranges languages and history, ancient and mod- 
ern; grammar, belles-lettres, rhetoric, and oratory, and a school for the 
deaf, dumb, and blind. ‘“ History,” he says, “is here associated with 
languages, not as a kindred subject, but on a principle of economy, be- 
cause both may be attained by the same course of reading, if books are 
selected with that view.” .This thought, originally advanced by Jefferson 
as the basis of elementary education, became in the person of George 
Long, the classical historian, one of the ideal corner-stones of the Uni- 
versity of Virginia. Under the head of mathematics Jefferson classified 
the following sciences: pure mathematics, physico-mathematics, physics 
chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zodlogy, anatomy, and the theory of 
medicine. 
Under philosophy he grouped ideology, ethics, the law of nature and 
of nations, government, and political economy. By the term ideology 
Jefferson meant simply the science of the human understanding. He 
borrowed his novel term from a French writer, Count Destutt Tracy, 
member of the Senate and of the Institute of France, whose treatise on 
the Elements of Ideology was first published in France in the year 1801, 
and is reported by Jefferson to have been condemned by Napoleon as. 
“the dark and metaphysical doctrine of Ideology, which, diving into first 
causes, founds on this basis a legislation of the people.”? This work, 
which the present generation would probably condemn on other grounds, 
made a profound impression upon Jefferson, who wished to establish 
democracy upon a philosophical basis. 
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Let us observe what Jefferson said to Peter Carr concerning profes- 
sional schools, the third and last topic of the discussion. To these schools 
would come those students who propose to make learning their profes- 
sion, and who wish to pursue particular sciences with more minuteness. 
and detail than is possible in the college proper, which would give 
simply a liberaleducation. ‘In these professional schools each science 
is to be taught in the highest degree it has yet attained.” Here Jeffer- 
son discovers the real university idea, and at the same time the idea of 
specialization for a definite purpose. “To these professional schools 
will come,” he says, ‘‘ the lawyer to the school of law ; the ecclesiastic to 
that of theology and ecclesiastical history ; the physician to those of the 
practice of medicine, materia medica, pharmacy, and surgery ; the mili- 
tary man to that of military and naval architecture and projectiles ; the 
agricultor to that of rural economy; the gentleman, the architect, the 
pleasure gardener, painter, and musician, to the school of fine arts.”

64 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Besides the university idea and the thought of these special schools, 
Jefferson, in his letter to Carr, clearly anticipated the modern idea of 
technical education. He proposed what he called a “ school of technical 
philosophy,” where certain of the higher branches should be taught in 
abridged form to meet practical wants. “Tosuchaschool,” he said, ‘will 
come the mariner, carpenter, shipwright, pump-maker, clock-maker, 
mechanist, optician, metallurgist, founder, cutler, druggist, brewer, vint- 
ner, distiller, dyer, painter, bleacher, soap-maker, tanner, powder-maker, 
salt-maker, glass-maker, to learn as much as shall be necessary to pursue 
their art understandingly, of the sciences of geometry, mechanics, statics, 
hydrostatics, hydraulics, hydrodynamics, navigation, astronomy, geog- 
raphy, optics, pneumatics, acoustics, physics, chemistry, natural history, 
botany, mineralogy, and pharmacy.” In this school of technology Jef- 
ferson proposed to group the students in convenient classes for element- 
ary and practical instruction by lectures, to be given in the evening, so 
as to afford an opportunity for labor in the day-time. Military exercises 
were to be required on certain days throughout the entire course for 
all grades of students. Thus the features of military schools, techno- 
logical institutes, and modern agricultural colleges were associated with 
the higher education in a people’s university, as conceived by Thomas 
Jefferson. 
Of course Jefferson did not expect to realize all at once this educa- 
tional scheme as proposed to Peter Carr. He urged as a practicable 
beginning the establishment of a general school or college, with four 
professorships, grouping, (1) language and history, belles-lettres, rhet- 
oric, and oratory; (2) mathematics, physics, etc.; (3) chemistry and 
other natural sciences; (4) philosophy, which, in his view, included 
’ political science. He said these professorships “ must be subdivided 
from time to time, as our means increase, until each professor shall have 
no more under his care than he can attend to with advantage to his pu- 
pils and ease to himself.” With further increase of resources, profes- 
sional schools were to be added. Such were the fundamental lines of 
thought which gave shape to the first project for a University of Vir- 
giniain Jefferson’s own neighborhood. Like the preliminary drawings 
of a great artist, these bold outlines have a permanent interest to the 
student.   
JEFFERSON’S APPEAL TO CABELL IN THE LEGISLATURE. 
Peter Carr sent the letter which Jefferson had written him to a member 
of the Legislature, together with other documents prepared by Jefferson 
in the interest of the Albemarle Academy. That member appears to 
have held them back for some unaccountable reason. On the 5th of Jan- 
uary, 1815, Jefferson wrote as follows to his energetic friend, Joseph O. 
Cabell: “Could the petition which the Albemarle Academy addressed 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  
JEFFERSON AND CABELL. 65 
to our Legislature have succeeded at the late session, a little aid addi- 
tional to the objects of that would have enabled us to have here imme- 
diately the best seminary of the United States. I do not know to whom 
P. Carr (president of the board of trustees) committed the petition and 
papers; but I have seen no trace of their having been offered. Think- 
ing it possible you may not have seen them, I send for your perusal the 
copies I retained for my own use. They consist: (1) Of a letter to him, 
sketching, at the request of the trustees, a plan for the institution; (2) 
one to Judge Cooper, in answer to some observations he had favored 
me with, on the plan; (3) a copy of the petition of the trustees; (4) a 
copy of the act we wished from the Legislature. They are long, but 
as we always counted on you as the main pillar of their support, and 
we shall probably return to the charge at the next session, the trouble of 
reading them will come upon you, and as well now as then. The lot- 
tery allowed by the former act, the proceeds of our two glebes, and our 
dividend of the literary fund, with the reorganization of the institu- 
tion, are what was asked for in that petition. In addition to this, if we 
could obtain a loan for four or five years only of $7,000 or $8,000, I 
think I have it now in my power to obtain three of the ablest characters in 
the world to fill the higher professorships of what in the plan is called the 
second or general grade of education; three such characters as are not 
in a single university of Europe; and for those of language and mathe- 
matics, a part of the same grade, able professors doubtless could also 
be readily obtained. With these characters I should not be afraid to 
say that the circle of the sciences composing that second or general 
grade would be more profoundly taught here than in any institution in 
the United States, and I might go farther.” 
It is very interesting to observe, in this same letter to Cabell, that 
Jefferson says he has lately received a letter from Jean Baptiste Say, 
who was contemplating a removal to America, ‘‘and to this neighbor- 
hood.” Undoubtedly Jefferson had him in mind as “one of the three 
ablest characters in the world” for a professorship in the new institu- 
tion. Virginia would indeed have had one of the most distinguished 
representatives of economics, if Jean Baptiste Say! had been per- 
suaded to come, as at one time seemed highly probable. Another of 
the three prospective members of the faculty was undoubtedly Thomas 
Cooper, who would at that time have represented chemistry, and natural 
science in general, better than any man of Jefferson’s acquaintance 
in America, The third genius must have been a philosopher, for, ac- 
cording to the above letter, Jefferson had as yet no one in view for 
either language or mathematics. Possibly the “ideologist” was to be 
Count Destutt Tracy, for whose writings Jefferson was making vig- 
orous propaganda at this very time. It was certainly correspond- 
ence with such men as these that made Jefferson so eager to develop   
10n Say’s project of removing to ‘‘ the neighborhood of Charlottesville, on which he 
has cast his eye,” see Jefferson’s letter to M. Correa de Serra, December 27, 1814.

a local academy into a larger institution, where genius could find free 
scope. 
THE LITERARY FUND. 
As early as 1810 the Legislature of Virginia had instituted the so-called 
literary fund. A bill, drawn up by James Barbour and presented by a 
committee of which Mr. Cabell was a member, was passed that year and 
appropriated ‘certain escheats, penalties, and forfeitures to the en- 
couragement of learning.” It is not at all improbable that the influ- 
ence of Jefferson, through Cabell, was at the bottom of this enactment, 
although the credit of it was claimed by Governor Barbour in an ad- 
dress at a planters’ convention in Richmond, m 1836.! In the winter of 
1815-16 Charles Fenton Mercer, chairman of the committee on finance, 
reported to the lower house a measure favoring the increase of the liter- 
ary fund by the addition of the debt then due to Virginia by the Govy- 
ernment of the United States for expenses incurred in the war of 1812. 
This report, which was adopted, is the origin of Mr. Mercer’s rival claim 
to the honor of establishing the literary fund, which claim he advanced in 
an address on popular education, published in 1826. Undoubtedly both 
Governor Barbour and Mr. Mercer deserve individual credit for their 
part in laying what afterward became one of the most substantial eco- 
nomic foundations of the University of Virginia; but we must remem- 
ber that the forces of legislation are always very complex, and that the 
secret springs of action are not always seen. Some light is thrown 
upon Mr. Mercer’s report by the following extract from a letter to Jeffer- 
son, written by Cabell, January 24, 1816: “ Since writing the enclosed 
letter I have conversed with Mr. Mercer, of the House of Delegates, to 
whom I had lent your letter to Mr. Carr, upon being informed by him 
that he had it in contemplation to endeavor to get a considerable part 
of the debt due from the General Government to the State of Virginia 
appropriated to the establishment of a grand scheme of education. He 
appears much pleased with your view of the subject, and as he proposes 
to make a report to the lower house, concurs with me in the propriety 
of availing the country of the light you have shed upon this great in- 
terest of the community. Would you object to the publication of your 
letter to Mr. Carr? Indeed, sir, I may take the liberty to have your 
letter printed before I can get your answer. I do not believe the Gen- 
eral Assembly will make at this time so great an appropriation as the 
one proposed by Mr. Mercer; but I will do anything in my power to

Cabell, 50. 
2 Jefferson consented, February 2, 1816, to the publication of his letter, and it ap- 
peared in the Richmond Enquirer about that time. On the 2ist of February, 1816, 
Cabell wrote to Jefferson: ‘‘ You will have seen your letter to Mr. Carr in the En- 
quirer. It came out on the morning of the day that the resolution passed the House 
of Delegates appropriating the surplus [all over and above $600,000] of our United 
States debt to the literary fund, and, I have reasons to believe, had a considerable 
effect in promoting the passage of that resolution.”

“THE LITERARY FUND. 6T 
promote it. And should the measure succeed, my object would be to 
make your plan the basis of our measures. * * * My intention is, 
as soon as I hear from you, to secure the passage of the bill respecting 
the Central College, nearly or entirely in its present shape. Then, or 
previously, I will, if not prevented, publish your letter to Mr. Carr, so 
as to prevent this game from being easily taken out of the hands of 
those who are entitled to it.” Cabell referred to the probable rivalry 
of Staunton and Lexington with Charlottesville for the establishment 
of “a great State seminary.” 
Jefferson early saw the possibilities. of the literary fund for the en- 
dowment of a State university. In a letter to Cabell, dated Septem- 
ber 30, 1814, he urges legislative precautions with reference to ‘“ the 
funds of the literary society,” an expression which the editor of the cor- 
respondence between Jefferson and Cabell is unable to explain (see 
note to page 30 of that volume). Jefferson meant simply the literary 
fund, and he meant fo secure a county-dividend of the same for the 
benefit of Albemarle Academy, as the petition presented to the Legisla- 
ture about this time clearly shows. With the development of Albe- 
marle Academy into Central College, Jefferson’s intentions took larger 
scope. He proposed gradually to absorb the profits of the entire fund, 
and also to capture the lion’s share of the endowment of William and 
Mary College, reducing that institution to the level ef half a dozen or 
more small colleges, all tributary to the central university. There 
lurked a deep meaning in that term Central-College. It was the idea 
of centralization in the higher education, first geographically, for general 
convenience, then economically and intellectually, for the highest good 
of the whole State. It would be the best educational policy for the 
United States and for the individual States. The great obstacles to 
the first success of this bold idea were: 
(1) The democratic impulse to distribute the proceeds of the literary 
fund for the establishment of common schools, which, Jefferson always. 
urged, should be founded and sustained_by local government and local 
taxation, or by self help in townships, wards, or school districts. 
(2) The opposition of Federalists to Jefferson’s project. 
(3) The powerful opposition of William and Mary College, which was 
fighting for life. 
(4) The rivalry of Washington College at Lexington, a Presbyterian 
institution, second only to William and Mary in historic prestige. 
(5) The municipal attractions of Richmond, Staunton, and other 
growing places. 
(6) Eeclesiastical opposition, directed against the proposed non-sec- 
tarianism of Jefferson’s university,—another great idea in modern edu- 
cation. 
(7) The policy of decentralization and local distribution of State 
bounties to the higher education,—the worst of all enemies to the idea 
of State universities. 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
68 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
That Jefferson and Cabell should have succeeded in triumphing over 
all of these foes, in securing a large part of the literary fund, and in 
centralizing the higher education in the vicinity of Charlottesville, is 
one of the greatest triumphs in American educational history, for it 
was the first of its kind and cost the hardest struggle. 
CENTRAL COLLEGE. 
The methods by which the University of Virginia was evolved from 
the individual thought of Jefferson into apopular institution are an un- 
written chapter in American educational history, but it is worth writing, 
because it shows how vital a connection may be established between 
democracy and the higher education, and that, too, under the most un- 
favorable conditions. There was absolutely nothing for Jefferson to 
build upon except an idea. It was impossible to make a State univer- 
sity out of old William and Mary College, which was then a church in- - 
stitution. There were not even’ common schools to render education 
popular, Jefferson had conceived the original idea of developing into 
a State university a county academy which as yet existed only on paper. 
There was no endowment whatever. Everything had to be created. 
Through the energy of Cabell the petition of the trustees of Albemarle 
Academy to receive for this institution the money which had arisen 
from the sale of the two glebes of the parishes of Saint Ann and Fred- 
ericksville in Albemarle County, was granted; but the application to 
have, for the same purpose, their county dividend of the literary fund, 
was rejected by the Legislature. 
On the 14th of February, 1816, was passed an act changing the name 
of Albemarle Academy to Central College, of which the Governor of the 
Commonwealth was to be the patron, with power to appoint a board of 
six visitors and to fill vacancies. The visitors could appoint professors 
and other officers. Thomas Jefferson was the only one of the old acad- 
emy board who was re-appointed. The new appointees were James Madi- 
son, James Monroe, Joseph CO. Cabell, David Watson, and J. H. Cocke. 
in the new corporation were vested all the rights and privileges of the 
old board, which handed over the records of Albemarle Academy. The 
records of Central College extend from May 5, 1817, to May 11, 1818. 
They are interesting for the light they throw upon the gradual evolu- 
tion of the University of Virginia from a local seminary. The corner- 
stone of Central College was laid October 6, 1817, in the presence of 
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe, then President 
of the United States. Probably no institution of learning in the United 
States ever had so many presidential trustees. 
IDEA OF AN ACADEMICAL VILLAGE. 
Among the external features of the University of Virginia, as it now 
stands, nothing is more interesting to the visitor than the peculiar ground- 
plan of construction. Itseems to be a modern adaptation of the medieval 
idea of cloistered retreats, with colonnades and quadrangles, the latter

opening toward the south. The buildings consist of pavilions, or large 
-two-storied houses, for the professors, which, with the large library 
building or rotunda, are arranged at intervals around three sides of a 
a square, and are all connected by small one-storied brick dormitories 
for the students, each dormitory containing only one room, which opens 
upon a covered colonnade or kreuzgang, suggestive of a monastic cell. 
A reproduction of the medieval monastery was perhaps very far from 
Jefferson’s mind; but, whether. consciously or unconsciously, he revived 
some of its most striking architectural effects, although in classical 
rather than in Gothic style. 
The historical germ of the whole plan of construction may be found 
in the records of the first meeting of the trustees of the Central College, 
May 5, 1817, when “‘ on view of a plan presented to the trustees of the 
Albemarle Academy for erecting a distinct pavilion or building for each 
separate professorship, and for arranging these around a square, each 
pavilion containing a school-room and two apartments for the accom- 
modation of the professor, with other reasonable conveniences, the 
board determines that one of those pavilions shall now be erected, and 
they request the proctor, so soon as the funds are at his command, to 
agree with proper workmen for the building of one, of stone or brick 
below ground and of brick above, of substantial work, of regular archi- 
tecture, well executed, and to be completed, if possible, during the en- 
suing summer and winter. * * * And it is further resolved, that 
so far as the funds may admit, the proctor be requested to proceed to the 
erection of dormitories for the students adjacent to the said pavilion, 
not exceeding ten on each side, of brick, and of regular architecture, 
according to the same plan proposed.” 
In a report made by the trustees of Central College, January 6, 1818, 
to the speaker of the House of Delegates, it is stated that they pur- 
chased “at a distance of a mile from Charlottesville, and for the sum 
of $1,518.75, two hundred acres of land, on which was an eligible site for 
the college, high, dry, open, furnished with good water, and nothing 
in its vicinity which could threaten the health of the students. 
“Instead of constructing a single and large edifice, which might have 
exhausted their funds, and left nothing, or too little, for other essential 
expenses, they thought it better to erect a small and separate building 
or pavilion for each professor they should be able to employ, with an 
apartment for his lectures and others for his own accommodation, con- 
necting these pavilions by a range of dormitories, capable each of lodg- 
ing two students only—a provision equally friendly to study as to mor- 
als and order. 
“The plan offered the further advantages of greater security against 
fire and infection, of extending the buildings in equal pace with the 
funds, and of adding to them indefinitely hereafter, with the indefinite 
progress of the contributions, private or public, and it gave to the whole, 
in form and effect, the character of an academical village.”

70 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
Such was Jefferson’s idea of the external form of the future University 
of Virginia. In this report, of which he is manifestly the author, the 
trustees of Central College assure the Legislature of their willingness to 
transfer all the property and rights of Central College toward the estab- 
lishment of a State university. They say that they have realized nearly 
$3,200 from the sale of the glebe lands, and altogether, including sub- 
scriptions, they “count with safety on forty-six or forty-seven thousand 
dollars.” The actual subscription lists to the Central College which are 
printed in the Correspondence of Jefferson and Cabell, show a total of 
over $44,000. These lists of names represent twelve different counties 
and three cities, Richmond, Lynchburg, and Winchester, and show a 
remarkably wide-spread interest in Jefferson’s project. Jefferson, Mad- 
ison, Monroe, Cabell, Cocke, and five other gentlemen subscribed each 
$1,000. There were over two hundred subscriptions, ranging from $5 
to $500. Such liberality and such a considerable number of names are 
interesting evidence of the favorable attitude of the Virginia planters 
at this period (1818) toward the higher education. 
JEFFERSON TO JOHN ADAMS ON CENTRAL COLLEGE, 
The progress and prospects of Central College, just before its transi- 
tion into the University of Virginia, are well shown in a letter from 
Jefferson to John Adams, dated Poplar Forest,! September 8, 1817: 
“A month’s absence from Monticello has added to the delay of ac- 
knowledging your last letters, and, indeed; for a month before I left it, 
our projected college gave me constant employment; for, being the only 
visitor in its immediate neighborhood, all its administrative business 
falls on me, and that, where building is going on, is not a little. In 
yours of July 15th, you express a wish to see our plan, but the present 
visitors have sanctioned no plan as yet. Our predecessors, the first 
trustees, had desired me to propose one to them, and it was on that oc- 
casion I asked and received the benefit of your ideas on the subject. 
Digesting these with such other schemes as I had been able to collect, 
I made out a prospectus, the looser and less satisfactory from the uncer- 
tain amount of the funds to which it was to be adapted. This I ad- 
dressed, in the form ofa letter, to their president, Peter Carr, which, 
going before the Legislature when a change in the constitution of the 
college was asked, got into the public papers, and, among others, I 
think you will find it in Niles’ Register, in the early part of 18152 This, 
however, is to be considered but as a premiére ébauche, for the consider- 
ation and amendment of the present visitors, and to be accommodated   
1 Mr. Jefferson’s farm in Bedford County. 
2 The exact reference is Niles’ Register, March 16,1816, where Jefferson’s letter to 
Peter Carr may be found. A letter from Jefferson ou elementary education occurs in 
Niles, May 2,1818. This Baltimore journal followed with great interest the progress 
of Jefferson’s educational work. Niles, June 26, 1824, announces the courses of in- 
struction that were soon to be opened at the University of Virginia.

to one of two conditions of things. If the institution is to depend on 
private donations alone, we shall be forced to accumulate on the shoul- 
ders of four professors a mass of sciences which, if the Legislature 
adopts it, should be distributed among ten. We shall be ready for a 
professor of languages in April next, for two others the following year, 
and a fourth the year after. How happy should we be if we could 
have a Ticknor! for our first. A critical classic is scarcely to be found 
in the United States. To this professor a fixed salary of $500, with 
liberal tuition fees from the pupils, will probably give $2,000 a year. 
We are now on the lookout for a professor, meaning to accept of none 
but of the very first order.” 
  
1 An attempt was actually made, in 1820, to secure as professors for the University 
of Virginia, Mr. George Ticknor, of Boston, and Mr. Bowditch, of Salem. Apartments 
were promised, with a salary of $2,000 and with fees guaranteed to the additional 
amount of $500. Dr. Thomas Cooper, an Englishman, resident in Pennsylvania, was 
appointed the year before. All of these original negotiations excited considerable 
sectarian opposition in Virginia, because all three of the above-named gentlemen 
were reputed to be Unitarians. Upon this interesting point, see the Jefferson and 
Cabell correspondence, p. 233 et seg. The opposition to the Unitarian movement 
was not confined to the South. Cabell told Jefferson that it was through the corre- 
spondence of Bible Societies that ‘the discovery of the religious opinions of Ticknor 
and Bowditch was made.”

CHAPTER V. 
TRANSITION FROM THE COLLEGE TO THE UNIVERSITY. 
TWO LINES OF POLICY. 
Jefferson’s plans for the development of university education in Vir- 
ginia proceeded along two lines of policy. The first was local, origi- 
nating in Albemarle Academy, and advancing by local subscriptions to 
the actual foundation of Central Coliege. The second line of policy 
was legislative, and led from an economic base called the literary 
fund, to the idea of a State university. Itis clearly apparent that Jeffer- 
son meant that these two lines should converge and unite. His pur- 
pose then was to have Central College adopted by the State as the 
University of Virginia. Cabell was in the Legislature watching his 
opportunity and informing Jefferson of the progress of events. 
On the 24th of February, 1816, the president and directors of the 
literary fund were requested to prepare and report a system of public 
education, comprehending a university to be called “The University of 
Virginia,” and such additional colleges, academies, and schools as 
should diffuse the benefits of education throughout the Commonwealth. 
The responsible member of this commission was the president of the 
board of directors, W. C. Nicholas, Governor of the State. There was 
nothing easier for him to do than to seek the counsel of Jefferson. 
JEFFERSON'S LETTER TO GOVERNOR NICHOLAS. 
Although in retirement at Monticello, Jefferson was in constant cor- 
respondence with the public men of his time, both in and out of Vir- 
ginia. Early in the spring of 1816 we find Governor Nicholas asking 
Jefferson’s advice with reference to the subject of education. The Gov- 
ernor was president of the board of directors of the literary fund and 
was naturally desirous of making a good official report. Jefferson was 
an acknowledged authority upon educational matters, and to him the 
Governor turned for counsel. Jefferson gave it liberally in a long letter, 
dated at Monticello, April 2, 1816. After reminding the Governor of 
the close resemblance between the present recommendation of the Vir- 
ginia Legislature and bills for the more general diffusion of knowledge, 
reported in 1779, and proposing three grades of instruction,—a univer- 
sity, district colleges or grammar schools, and county or ward schools, 
Jefferson said: “The report will have to present the plan of an univer- 
72
-P-A-G-E-97
  JEFFERSON TO GOVERNOR NICHOLAS. 73 
sity, analyzing the sciences, selecting those which are useful, grouping 
them into professorships, commensurate each with the time and facul- 
ties of one man, and prescribing the regimen and all other necessary 
details. On this subject I can offer nothing new. A letter of mine to 
Peter Carr, which was published during the last session of Assembly, is a 
digest of all the information I possess on the subject, from which the 
board wili judge whether they can extract anything useful. * * * 
“ As the buildings to be erected will also enter into their report, I 
would strongly recommend to their consideration, instead of one im- 
mense building, to have a small one for every professorship, arranged 
at proper distances around a square, to admit of extension, connected 
by a piazza, so that they may go dry from one school to another. This 
village form is preferable to a single great building for many reasons, 
‘particularly on account of fire, health, economy, peace, and quiet. Such 
a plan had been approved in the case of the Albemarle College, which 
was the subject of the letter above mentioned; and should the idea be 
approved by the board, more may be said hereafter on the opportun- 
ity these small buildings will afford of exhibiting models in architecture 
of the purest forms of antiquity, furnishing to the student examples 
of the precepts he will be taught in that art.” Here is the connecting 
architectural link between the Albemarle Academy and the Univer- 
sity of Virginia, as conceived by Jefferson. 
In his letter to the Governor the Sage of Monticello did not fail to 
revertto his early and favorite project of elementary education by means 
of ward schools. He reminded the Governor that ideas upon that sub- 
ject had been long ago embodied in a bill for the general diffusion of 
knowledge in Virginia, and that time and reflection had only served to 
strengthen in his mind the general principle of subdividing the counties 
into wards, with a school in each ward, “ My partiality,” he said, “ for 
that division is not founded in views of education solely, but infi- 
nitely more as the means of a better administration of our goverment, 
and the eternal preservation of republican principles. The exam- 
ple of this most admirable of all human contrivances in government 
4s to be seen in our Eastern States; and its powerful effect in the 
order and economy of their internal affaire, and the momentum it gives 
them as a nation! is the single circumstance which distinguishes them 
go remarkably from every other national association. In a letter to 
Mr. Adams? a few years ago, I had occasion to explain to him the struct- 
ure of our scheme of education as proposed in the bill for the diffu- 
sion of knowledge, and the views of this particular section of it, and 
  
1 The use by Jefferson of the word “nation” for New England is very remarkable. 
It is, however, paralleled by the frequent employment, in American local usage, of the 
term “country” for-section, State, orcounty. And yet such usage is in perfect accord 
with the gradual development of our ideas of country and nation from local expe- 
rience. The Germanic village community of united families was the prototype of 
united Germany and of the United States.

in another lately to Mr. Cabell,! on the oceasion of the bill for the Albe- 
marie College, I also took a view of the political effects of the proposed 
division into wards, which, being more easily copied than thrown into 
new form here, I take the liberty of inclosing extracts from them. 
Should the board of directors approve of the plan and make ward di- 
visions the substratum of their elementary schools, their report may 
furnish a happy occasion of introducing them, leaving all their other 
uses to be adopted from time to time hereafter, as occasion shall occur.” 
CIRCULAR LETTER FROM GOVERNOR NICHOLAS. 
On the 30th of May, 1816, Governor Nicholas issued a circular letter 
to various distinguished gentlemen, asking advice respecting a system 
of public education for the State of Virginia. As president of the 
board of directors of the literary fund the duty to collect information 
devolved upon him, but itis highly probable that Jefferson, or his friend 
Cabell, who was in the Legislature, made valuable suggestions to the 
Governor with reference to this letter and the proper persons to address. 
Among the latter was Jefferson’s friend, Thomas Cooper, professor of 
chemistry in Carlisle College, Pennsylvania. The following passage 
from the circular letter is worthy of Jefferson himself: “The great cause 
of literature and science is not local in its nature, but is an object of 
interest to the whole human species. The commonwealth of letters em- 
braces every region, however remote. It can not fail to excite pleasing 
emotions in every enlightened American to perceive that Virginia has 
taken this subject under its patronage, and devoted a fund to its accom- 
plishment, which is annually increasing. To you, sir, 1 think it proper 
to address myself, knowing your attachment to literature, and feeling 
great confidence that you will not consider your valuable time mis- 
spent in communicating any ideas which may promote so useful an ob- 
ject. Ican assure you that they will be received with that high sense 
of obligation which their importance must inspire.” 
DR. COOPER ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. 
The following extracts from the reply of Dr. Cooper are worthy of 
preservation, for they are characteristic of one of the most remarkable 
educators in the United States at this period, and of the man in whom 
Jefferson had perhaps more confidence than in any other in American 
academic circles. In the lack of illustrations of his correspondence 
with Jefferson, this letter of advice to the Governor of Virginia, upon 
the subject dearest to Jefferson’s heart, is especially valuable. Cooper 
represents English? ideas of university education. After considering 
  
1 Letters of Jefferson and Cabell, 37. | 
2 Other traces of English influence besides the counsel of Dr, Cooper may be found 
in Jefferson’s study of English universities, as described in print. Jefferson owned 
 Russell’s Tract on the Universities of Great Britain, and lent it to Cabell, who showed 
it to such influential politicians as General Breckenridge and Mr. Johnson. Cabell 
also borrowed Jefferson’s Oxford and Cambridge Guide.
-P-A-G-E-99
  
COOPER ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, ao 
briefly the subject of schools and academies, he proceeds to state his 
views upon the main question : 
“Universities should be exclusively for aliberal and finished education. 
I doubt whether it be expedient to have more than one in the State, 
under State patronage.’ Such an university should, in my opinion, be 
instituted on a plan not much dissimilar to the following: 
“(1) It should be considered, held up, and taken for granted, that no 
young man can receive a finished education sufficient to enable him to 
commence the pursuit of any of the liberal professions, unless he has 
remained at the university till the completion of his nineteenth year ; if 
young men could be induced to stay for half a year longer it would be 
a very important acquisition, privately and publicly. They usually 
graduate so young that they enter upon life conceited sciolists. 
“ (2) It should be scrupulously insisted on that no youth can be ad- 
mitted to the university unless he can read with facility Virgil, Horace, 
Xenophon, and Homer ; unless he is‘ able, as a preliminary to matricu- 
lation, to convert a page of English at sight into Latin; uniess he can* 
demonstrate any proposition at sight in the six first books of Euclid, 
and shews an acquaintance with cubic and quadratic equations. With- 
out this, your university will become what all the American colleges 
and universities are, so far as I know them, mere grammar schools. 
You will have fewer students, but they will do credit to the institution, 
and raise its reputation; and entrance at such an university will be 
sought as an honor. 
‘“<(3) It can not be required, but it should be regularly and publicly ex- 
pected, that the university course of education should occupy four years. 
The more difficult Latin and Greek classics should be read at the uni- 
versity,—Euripides, Sophocles, Longinus, Demosthenes, ete. No week 
should pass without at least three pages of composition in Latin prose, 
and one in verse, upon given subjects. All the prominent political men, 
all the learned men, all the scientific men of my day, have entered upon 
active life as good classic scholars and good mathematicians. Judging 
from times past before I began life, and from what I have seen and ob- 
served myself, I am satisfied that a young man turned into the world a 
good classic and mathematician is far better qualified for any other lit- 
erary pursuit than those who have been educated in any other way. 
On this score my mind is fully made up. 
“ Attendant on these classical studies should be the higher parts of 
the mathematics, conic sections, fluxions, spherical trigonometry, etc. 
Also the study of the French language, with drawing, fencing, and the 
manual exercise. 
“These should occupy chiefly the two first years. I say chiefly, be- 
cause perhaps logic and a course of moral and political philosophy 
might be introduced the second year, though I should not incline to be- 
gin them till the third.

“The two next years might be occupied (never entirely omitting 
classical and mathematical studies) with— 
“The elements of moral and political philosophy and jurisprudence. 
“Lectures on natural philosophy—chemistry, botany, and zodlogy. 
“Perhaps room might also be found for a short course of anatomy. 
“Further than this it is needless to go. It will suffice to give them of 
these enough to show the roads that lead to the acquirement of knowl- 
edge. The basis of the system being classical and mathematical knowl- 
edge, I should not fear for a young man who was well grounded in 
these alone, at his first starting on the race of life, but much more may 
be added by a judicious course of study.” 
VIEWS OF PRESIDENT DWIGHT, OF YALE COLLEGE. 
Replies to the circular letter sent out by Governor Nicholas came 
from two college presidents, John Augustine Smith, M. D., president 
of William and Mary College from 1814 to 1826, and trom the Rey. Timo- 
- thy Dwight, president of Yale College. President Smith confined his 
remarks to the subject of popular education, and showed no special sym- 
pathy with the university idea. He said he presumed the object of the 
literary fund was “to inform those who must otherwise remain in total 
ignorance in the humbler but more important parts of knowledge than 
to make a comparatively few proficients in the sublimer parts of knowl- 
edge.” The management of William and Mary College was naturally 
opposed to the idea of a State university, which would certainly over- 
shadow the old college at Williamsburg and destroy its prestige. The 
struggle of William and Mary for existence and its race for life with 
Jefferson’s younger institution have been elsewhere narrated.! 
An interesting side light from New England is thrown upon colleges 
and universities in general, at this early period, by the answer of Presi- 
dent Dwight, of Yale College. He said: 
“ There are two difficulties in the way of returning such an answer 
to this application as in all probability is expected. One is, that the 
circular does not at all explain the specific views of the Virginian Legis- 
lature. The literary institutions which are mentioned in it are so ex- 
tremely different in different countries as often to have very little re- 
semblance to each other. An wniversity in Huropean language is, as 
your Excellency perfectly well knows, a seat of education in which stu- 
dents are conducted through all the branches of academical and pro- 
fessional knowledge, so as to be fitted to enter upon the practice of medi- 
cine, or to appear at the bar, or in the desk, without any additional 
instruction. A college, in the same language, is sometimes one of the 
several institutions which, when combined, constitute the university, 
and sometimes a seminary in which students barely obtain the require- 
ments for admission to the university. Lion College and the celebrated 
school of Westminster are seminaries of this nature.

  PRESIDENT DWIGHT OF YALE. 7 
“ In American phraseology, your Excellency must have observed, both 
these terms are used in a widely different manner. There are three sem- 
inaries in New England, which are styled universities; a fourth in New 
York; a fifth in Pennsylvania; a sixth in Georgia ; and a seventh in 
Kentucky. All these differ essentially from what is meant by the term 
in Hurope; and in none of them is education given to the extent spec- 
ified above. That of Cambridge, in Massachusetts, approximates nearer 
to the Huropean standard than any of the rest; but even that falls ma- 
terially short. 
“There are also in New England five colleges ; and many others which 
bear the name in different parts of the United States. In Yale College 
there is, probably, more science taught than in any other seminary in 
tbe American Union; but probably less of literature than in the univer- 
sity at Cambridge. Yetitis styled acollege. Several American colleges 
pursue nearly the same course of instruction; while others are calcu- 
lated upon so low a degree of the scale that bachelors of arts, coming 
from them to Yale College, have been unable to enter at any higher 
grade than the beginning of the second or sophomore year; and that 
without any defectiveness of talents or diligence. 
. “After these observations, it will be unnecessary to insist any further 
on the indeterminate meaning of these names, or on the impossibility 
of my knowing the sense in which they are used by the Legislature of 
Virginia. But without such knowledge it must be obviously impossi- 
ble for me to feel assured that any opinions which I might communicate 
would even reach the subject to which they were intentionally directed. 
“The other difficulty, to which I have referred, lies in the extensive 
and complicated nature of the subject. Will your Excellency pardon . 
me for observing, that, having lived more than thirty years in Yale 
College, and in every station included in its system, the experience 
forced upon me during this period has furnished me with a complete 
conviction that the views formed concerning such an institution by 
men unacquainted with this subject except by speculation, and those of 
the first talents, are necessarily inadequate and erroneous. If Iam 
not deceived, a considerable number of American colleges have failed 
of success from defects in their original establishment; defects de- 
rived from the want of an experimental acquaintance with such an in- 
stitution in those under whose direction their several systems began 
their operations. 
“Tf my experience has not deceived me, such a scheme of a college 
in the American sense, and still more of a university in the Huropean 
sense, as will fairly promise extensive utility to the public, must in- 
volve many important parts, all\of them nearly or absolutely indis- 
pensable, and many more subordinate ones, each of which would con- 
tribute in a considerable degree to the perfection of the whole. To 
state in the most concise manner a scheme of this nature, and the 
proofs by which its expediency might be evinced, would require at least

a large pamphlet. For such work I have neither time, nor health, nor 
eyes. 
“For the prolixity of this apology 1 have-no other justification be- 
side what is furnished by the high importance of the subject, and the 
respectability of the source from which the application is derived. 
“ With this letter I transmit to your Excellency a copy of the Laws of 
Yale College. In them may perhaps be found the best answer, in my 
power, to some of the questions which would naturally be asked in the 
course of such an investigation as that which the president and direct- 
ors of the literary fund have commenced. Here these laws have had a 
happy efficacy. 
“Tf I may suppose myself authorized to give an opinion concerning 
the subject at large, I beg leave to suggest that the best mode, within 
my knowledge, of conducting the requisite inquiries to a successful is- 
sue, so far as they may respect the New England seminaries, will be to 
_ commission a competent person to visit such of them as may be thought 
proper, and by inspection and conversation to learn whatever may be 
useful in their respective systems. Such a person would be able to 
state the specific purposes which the Legislature of Virginia have in 
view, and could ask the questions and obtain the explanations which 
may be conducive to the general design.” *° 
REPORT OF GOVERNOR NICHOLAS. 
Letters were received from James Monroe, then Secretary of State 
under Madison, and from Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, of New York. The lat- 
ter sent an elaborate article upon the philosophy of education, with peda- 
gogical plans for all grades of instruction, from domestic to scholastic, 
from the school to the university. Monroe recognized the importance 
of a general system of education for the preservation of good govern- 
ment, but intimated that there were men in Virginia better qualified than 
himself to give advice in educational matters. He accepted the ap- 
pointment as one of the board of visitors of Central College, in Albe- 
marle, but offered no suggestions to the president and directors of the 
literary fund. Their report was made through Governor Nicholas to 
the General Assembly in December, 1816, and is published in the collec- 
tion of Sundry Documents on the Subject of a System of Public Educa- 
tion, which was distributed among the citizens of the State by legislative 
order. If Jefferson was not the author cf this entire report, his ideas 
pervade it from beginning to end. We have already seen that Gover- 
nor Nicholas sought Jefferson’s advice before that of any one else, and 
we shall now see that he followed it in preference to other views. The 
official voice is the Governor’s, but the hand is Jefferson’s. 
We find the general subject subdivided into primary schools, acade- 
mies, and a university. The whole system was based upon a proposed 
subdivision of counties into townships, each to support one primary 
school and to have charge of its own roads, its own poor, and its own

police. The Lancastrian method of teaching was recommended, Next 
above the common schools were to be the avademies, where Latin, 
Greek, French, mathematics, geography, astronomy, etc., were to be 
taught. Jefferson’s provision for “ the boys of brightest genius” re-ap- 
pears in the proposed connection of the schools, academies, and univer- 
sity. ‘The term university,” declares this report, “comprehends the 
whole circle of the arts and sciences, and extends to the utmost boun- 
daries of human knowledge.” The directors of the literary fund say 
they have resorted to every source of information respecting the con- 
stitution of colleges in America and Europe, but they find no two abso- 
lutely alike. Jefferson had made that observation to Peter Carr. The 
peculiar conditions of Virginia must be studied and the university 
adapted to the needs of its people. The report advises against begin- 
ning on too large a scale. The purchase of land for the university is 
recommended ‘ in some central and healthy part of the Commonwealth.” 
Here surely is Jefferson’s hand. The buildings are to be paid for out 
of the literary fund. A board of fifteen visitors is recommended, with 
power to appoint nine professors, chiefly in modern and scientific stud. 
ies. Jefferson had always wished such acurriculum? The visitors were 
also to have power to appoint seven fellows “owt of the most learned and 
meritorious of those who have graduated at said university.” 
IDEA OF ESTABLISHING FELLOWSHIPS, 1816. 
The following extract from this remarkable report on the University 
of Virginia deserves to be quoted in full, because it anticipates so much 
of what is essentially modern in American university education. “The 
recommendation of the establishment of fellowships is founded on a 
wish to encourage the ardent pursuit of science in such young men, 
who, though destitute of the means of obtaining an education, have 
been selected for their talents, and instructed and supported at the pub- 
lic expense. It is to them we ought to look as the source which is to sup- 
ply us with teachers and professors, and thus by the service they will 
render in imparting instruction to the youth of the country, they will 
amply repay what that country has done for their benefit. Besides, it is 
a consideration of great importance that you ereate a corps of literary 
men, who, enabled by receiving a decent competence to devote their 
whole time to the pursuits of science, will enlarge its boundaries and 
diffuse through the community a taste and relish for the charms of litera- 
ture. The effect produced by concentrating at one place many literary 
men, whose co-operation, as well as whose collisions, will excite a gen- 
erous spirit of emulation, is incalculable.” 
MERCER’S BILL FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, 1817. 
The above favorable report naturally led to a bill providing for the 
establishment of primary schools, academies, colleges, and @ univer- 
sity. The bill, drawn up by Mr. Mercer partly upon the basis of 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  80 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY or VIRGINIA. 
Jefferson’s ideas, passed the House of Delegates on the 18th of Febru- 
ary, 1817, but it was rejected by the Senate on the 20th of the same 
month. The measure was, however, noteworthy in some of its features. 
It provided for a board of public instruction, to be elected by joint ballot 
of the Senate and House of Delegates, and to have general educational 
control of Virginia. They were to establish and locate “ the Univer- 
sity of Virginia,” together with a general system of colleges and acade- 
mies. The bill also provided for a system of primary schools, and for 
the subdivision of counties into townships and wards, and of cities, bor- 
oughs, or towns into wards, when containing more than one hundred 
white families; if less, the corporation was to be comprehended in some 
township. As soon as a ward or township had provided a school-house 
worth $200, and a board of trustees for school management, the direct- 
ors of the literary fund, to whom the school-house and lot must be con- 
veyed, were authorized to pay over annually the sum of $200 for the 
teacher’s salary and $10 for school books for poor children. Jefferson 
was always strongly opposed to such local distribution of the literary 
fund. He believed in the local maintenance of common schools; but the 
best experience of the Old World and of the New shows that localities 
vary so much in economic strength that county boards of equalization 
are sometimes a real necessity. A compromise between public bounty 
and local taxation is sometimes desirable. 
AOCADEMICAL DISTRICTS. 
The bill of 1817 further provided for the division of Virginia, accord- 
ing to the census of free whites, into forty-eight “ academical districts,” 
containing one or morecounties. Suitableand convenient academies act- 
ually existing were to be recognized as State institutions, when conveyed 
to the president and directors of the literary fund. While retaining 
their former trustees and local. government, they became entitled to 
State aid. Where new academies were to be erected, the same line of 
policy was proposed as in the case of the primary schools. The aca- 
demical district was obliged to furnish the necessary land, and at least 
three-fourths of the cost of the necessary buildings, which were esti- 
mated at $10,000. The management of the academy was to be intrusted 
to a board of thirteen persons residing within the district and appointed 
by the general board of public instruction. One-quarter of the cost of 
building and one-fourth of the salaries for teachers was to be paid from 
the literary fund. Noteworthy is the fact that the bill of 1817 author- 
ized the acceptance of “ the Anne Smith Academy, for the education of 
females,” and permitted the establishment of similar institutions not. 
exceeding five. 
PLAN FOR NEW COLLEGES. 
To the colleges then existing in the State four more were to be added, 
called, respectively, Pendleton, Wythe, Henry, and Jefferson, in con-
-P-A-G-E-105
  PLAN FOR COLLEGES. 81 
venient and healthful localities, where sufficient land had been freely 
offered, and at least $35,000 had been subscribed for the college and its 
library. Trustees were to be invested with governing authority by the 
board of public instruction. ‘The title to thé land and college buildings 
was to be conveyed to the managers of the literary fund, which in 
turn should grant the college one-fourth as much money as had been 
locally subscribed, and one-fifth of the annual salaries of teachers and 
professors. William and Mary, Hampden-Sidney, and Washington 
Colleges were to be allowed to make proposals with reference to 
entering this general system of State colleges and of sharing State 
bounty in a similar manner. 
IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY. 
The bill of 1817 made inadequate provision for the University of Vir- 
ginia, but the idea was clearly in view. The board of public instruc- 
tion was authorized to fix upon a proper site, with primary regard ‘“ to 
the geographical centre of the Commonwealth, and to the principal 
channels of intercourse through its territory,” together with health, econ- 
omy, and such advantages as might arise from local philanthropy. At 
least fifty acres of land, $100,000 for buildings, and $10,000 for a library 
must be secured and placed at the disposition of the literary fund for 
university purposes. A general subscription throughout the State was 
authorized through the agency of county and corporation courts. Pro- 
vision was also made for reports of all trustees to the board of public 
instruction, and for a general educational report to the General Assem- 
bly, concerning the state of education and embracing the University of 
Virginia. 
The provisions of this bill, although never carried out, are interesting 
and instructive as showing one of the first definite plans in this country 
for an organized system of education under the control of the State. 
The bill laid chief stress upon common-school education, and gave it the 
preference in the distribution of public money. Jefferson, while the 
friend of common schools, would have made them self-supporting, and 
have reserved State bounty for the higher education and the University. 
JEFFERSON’S BILL, 1817-18. 
Mr. Mercer’s bill, of which an analysis has just been given, was very 
unsatisfactory to Jefferson. He wrote to Cabell, October 24, 1817: “I 
received the pamphlet you were so kind as to have directed to me, con- 
taining several papers on the establishment of a system of education. 
A serious perusal of the bill for that purpose convinced me that, un- 
less something less extravagant could be devised, the whole undertak- 
ing must fail. The primary schools alone on that plan would exhaust 
the whole funds, the colleges as much more, and a university would 
never come into question. However slow and painful the operation of 
writing is become from a stiffening wrist, and however deadly my aver- 
17036—No. 2. 6    
-P-A-G-E-106
82 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
sion to the writing-table, I determined to try! whether I could not con- 
trive a plan more within the compass of our funds. I send you the re- 
sult brought into a single bill, lest by bringing it on by detachments 
some of the parts might be lost.” 
The following is arésumé of Jefferson’s bill, which is not without sug- 
gestive value. The old lines of historic continuity are discernible in 
this plan, and it is clearly an advance upon the views advanced in the 
famous letter to Peter Carr. Jefferson proposed that the judge of the 
superior court, in every county, should appoint three visitors of primary 
schools. These visitors were to subdivide their respective counties into 
wards, comprehending ‘each about the number of militia sufficient for 
acompany.” The visitors were then to call ward meetings, and the ma- 
jority vote of “the warders” was to determine the location of the 
school-house and how it should be built. A plurality vote was to elect 
a resident warden, to direct the process of building, and to care for 
school property. All persons liable to work on the highways were to 
be subject to the warden’s call to work on the school-house, unless it 
should be built by pecuniary contributions. Ward meetings were to 
be held in the school-house after its completion. This place should 
become the centre of local government as well as of local education. 
The selection of teachers and the examination of schools were to be 
intrusted to the county board of visitors—a good device for economic 
and uniform management. 
Jefferson then proceeded to distribute the several counties into nine 
collegiate districts. The president and directors of the literary fund, 
henceforth to be known as the board of public instruction, were to 
appoint a board of visitors for each collegiate district, with one mem- 
ber from each county in that district. These visitors were to view their 
district and report to the central board of public instruction the best 
sites for a college, and the latter board was to decide the matter. The 
visitors were then to be empowered to purchase the approved site, ex- 
ercising, if necessary, through the county sheriff, the right of condemn- 
ing private property for a public purpose. They were limited to $500 ex- 
penditure for grounds and to $7,000 for buildings. Each college was to 
have two professors, with salaries of $500 each, to be paid from the liter 
ary fund, with such additional fees from pupils as the visitors should de- 
termine. ‘In the said colieges shall be taught the Greek, Latin, French, 
Spanish, Italian, and German languages, English grammar, geography, 
ancient and modern, the higher branches of numerical arithmetic, the 
mensuration of land, the use of the globes, and the ordinary elements 
of navigation.” The visitors were to have the appointing power and the 
general management of the college property. They could employ a 
steward and a bursar. Members of the board were to visit the college 
at least once a year and examine its management. The action of col- 
legiate boards was subject to revision by the board of public in- 
struction.  
-P-A-G-E-107
  
CENTRAL COLLEGE. 83 
PROPOSITION FOR A CENTRAL UNIVERSITY. 
To these provisions for popular and collegiate education Jefferson 
added a proposition for a university, ‘in a central and healthy part of 
the State.” With regard to the very delicate question of the site he 
draughted two forms of statement, one in general terms giving the 
power of selection to a doard of eight visitors, subject to approval by the 
board of public instruction; and the other in specific terms providing for 
the acceptancgof all the lands, buildings, property, and rights of Central 
College, whenever its board of visitors should authorize a transfer to 
the board of public instruction, for the purposes of a university. In 
the institution should be taught “history and geography, ancient and 
modern; natural philosophy, agriculture, chemistry, and the theories 
of medicine; anatomy, zodlogy, botany, mineralogy, and geology; 
mathematics, pure and mixed; military and naval science; ideology, 
ethics, the law of nature and of nations; law, municipal and foreign; the 
science of civil government and political economy; languages, rhetoric, 
belles-lettres, and the fine arts generally; which branches of science 
shall be so distributed and under so many professorships, not exceed- 
ing ten, as the visitors shall think most proper.” Each professor was 
to have apartments and a salary, not exceeding $1,000 a year, to be paid 
from the literary fund, with tuition fees from students. The visitors 
were to have the appointing power and the general control of the insti- 
tution, subject to the board of public instruction. 
To prepare the way for this bill, Jefferson addressed to the speaker of 
the House of Delegates a report of the visitors on the progress of Cen- 
tral College, already described in another connection., Of this instruct- 
ive report two hundred and fifty copies were printed by order of the 
House and distributed. Jefferson wrote to Cabell, December 18, 1817: 
“J think you had better keep back the general plan till this report is 
made, as I am persuaded it will give a lift to that. Pray drop me a 
line when any vote is passed which furnishes an indication of the suc- 
cess or failure of the general plan. I have only this single anxiety in 
this world. It is a bantling of forty years’ birth and nursing, and if I 
can once see it on its legs, I will sing with sincerity and pleasure my 
nune dimittas.” 
PUBLIC EDUCATION. 
The most cherished scheme of Jefferson’s life was now to be launched 
anew upon the current of politics. He had attempted to promote uni- 
versity education in connection with William and Mary College, in the 
time of the American Revolution, but the project had been swamped. 
Now he was about to launch his own independent institution, bearing 
the name of Central College, but soon to be called the University of Vir- 
ginia. With what anxiety the old man of seventy-five years watched 
the fate of his carefully drawn report on Central College, and of his bill 
for establishing a system of public education! In a letter to Cabell, 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
84 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
dated January 14, 1818, minutely explaining his plan for self-support- 
ing elementary schools, Jefferson concludes: “A system of general in- 
struction which shall reach every decolipiaoe of our citizens, from the 
richest to the poorest, as it was the earliest, so will it be the latest of all 
the public concerns in which I shall permit myself to take an interest. Nor 
am I tenacious of the form in which it] shall be introduced. Be that 
what it may, our descendants will be as wise as we are, and will know 
how to amend and amend it until it shall|suit their circumstances. Give 
it to us, then, in any shape, and receive for the inestintable boon the 
thanks of the young, and the blessings pf the old, who are past all other 
services but prayers for the prosperity of their country and blessings to 
those who promote it.” D 
This letter was published by Cabéll in the Richmond Enquirer, Feb- 
ruary 10,1818. In every possible way| Cabell propagated Jefferson’s 
ideas. -While the “enlightened few” ee and read with favor, there 
was in the Legislature, particularly in the House of Delegates, a strong 
opposition to Jefferson’s bill: The printing of two hundred and fifty 
copies was only grudgingly allowed. The “back country” and western 
members were particularly stubborn. ‘They wanted the capital of Vir- 
ginia removed from Richmond to Staunton, and they were afraid that 
Central College would establish the ‘ded of political centrality for the 
neighborhood of Charlottesville. ‘For two months,” wrote Cabell, 
“certain persons have been training those members to oppose all that 
could come from you. The back-countily spirit has been industriously 
excited.” Cabell said the friends of ey and Lexington wished to 
keep down Central College. Sectional division and the clashing of local 
interests made him almost despair of any general plan. Jefferson’s op- 
ponents admitted that his bill was a finished production in theory, but 
they were not willing to let it go into practice. The bill received very 
few votes in a House committee of the|whole, and a substitute offered 
by Mr. Hill, of King William County, jwas recommended for adoption- 
FIRST APPROPRIATION FROM THE LITERARY FUND, 1818. 
The House of Delegates at first favored a small appropriation from 
the literary fund for the education of the poor, and the application of 
the rest of the fund to the payment of the debts of the State. From 
such a Philistine view of an economic resource, long set apart for educa- 
tional interests, the House at last rose, through the influence of agita- 
tion, to the idea of a compromise between the highest and lowest forms 
of education. Hill’s substitute for Jefferson’s bill proposed the appoint- 
ment by local courts of school commissioners in every county, city, and 
corporate town, “to determine what number of poor children they will 
educate,” and what should be paid for|their education, The commis. 
sioners were to select the children and| send them, with the assent of 
parents or guardian, to some convenient school, to be taught reading, 
writing, and arithmetic. The money for tuition, books, etc., was to come 
u

‘ 
ROCKFISH GAP COMMISSION. 85 
out of a $45,000 reservation from the income of the literary fund, to be 
paid over to local school commissioners of counties, cities, and towns,! in 
proportion to the free white population. To this local State aid was to 
be added the ineome of all property held by the overseers of the poor 
and derived from the sale or forfeiture of glebe lands. Such was the 
wretched provision for primary education as a local charity, dependent 
upon State aid and parish spoils. The House of Delegates had appar- 
ently no conception of the importance of establishing common schools 
and of supporting them by local taxation. The provision amounted to 
a State and parish bounty upon poverty. 
Upon this well-meant but inadequate popular legislation the Senate 
had the sovereign good sense to tack a $15,000 annual appropriation 
for a university, wherein all the branches of useful science were to be 
taught. The site of the institution was to be determined by a board of 
commissioners, one from each senatorial district, to be appointed by the 
Governor of the State. The board was to meet at the tavern in Rock- 
fish Gap, in the Blue Ridge, in August, 1818, and determine the follow- 
ing matters: (1) The site of the university; (2) a plan for its construc- 
tion; (3) the branches of learning to be taught; (4) the number and 
description of the professorships; (5) general legislative provisions for 
organizing and governing the institution. This amendment passed the 
House of Delegates on the 21st of February, 1818. It was the entering 
wedge for the Jeffersonian idea, and it was driven in by Joseph C. Cabell, 
when the commissioners were appointed. He wroteto Jefferson: “We 
have jifteen districts on this side of the ridge, and I think we are safe 
in the hands of the executive.” Mr. Preston was at this time the Goy- 
ernor of Virginia, and was in thorough sympathy with the university 
project. Cabell suggested to Jefferson that “our policy will be to invest 
all our funds in buildings, and get them as far advanced by August as 
possible.” The founder of Central College needed no spurring in this 
direction. It had been his policy from the beginning to get his institu- 
tion well under way and then make the Legislature adopt it. - 
1 The results of this policy, while not the best, were better than nothing. Niles’s 
Register for December 17, 1825, says of Virginia: ‘‘ By returns from 98 counties and 
towns, received between the 30th of September, 1824, and 30th of September, 1825, 
it appears that 10,226 indigent children have been sent to school in those counties 
within the year.”

  CHAPTER VI. 
THE UNIVERSITY COMMISSION AND JEFFERSON’S 
REPORT. 
MEETING OF THE COMMISSIONERS AT ROCKFISH GAP. 
Professor Schele de Vere, of the University of Virginia, in a graphic 
article entitled “ Jefferson’s Pet,” published originally in Harper’s Mag- 
azine in May, 1872, and now forming the historical introduction to the 
Semi-Centennial Catalogue of the Students of the University, has given 
us a picturesque description of the scene of that famous meeting of the 
commissioners at. Rockfish Gap, where the fate of the higher ee 
in Virginia was hung in the balance. 
“ High up in the Blue Ridge,” he says, ‘at an elevation from which 
the eye takes in at a single glance a variety of scenes unequalled on 
this continent for beauty and loveliness, a little river rises in a dark 
gorge, to fall gently from terrace to terrace, and after a brief and rapid 
course, abounding with falls and cascades of infinite attractiveness, to 
pour its waters into the James River. As the mountains here sink to 
a lower level, and thus afford one of the passes through which in older 
days itnmigrants passed from what is called the Piedmont region of the 
State to the great Valley of Virginia, the place has received the idio- 
matic name of Rockfish Gap. Here, at a modest country inn, unpre- 
tending in appearance, but offering an abundant and well-served table, 
far from the turmoil of cities and the excitement of politics, met a party 
of men remarkable for their ability and virtue amidst a people which 
had already given four Presidents to the Union, and was well known 
to possess as much private as public worth. In the low-ceiled, white- 
washed room, the whole furniture of which consisted of a dining-room 
table and rude ‘ split-bottom’ chairs of home make, sat the President of 
the United States, Mr. Monroe, and two of his predecessors, Mr. Madi- 
son and Mr. Jefferson, besides a number of judges and eminent states. 
men. ‘ Yet,’ says one of Mr. Jefferson’s biographers, ‘it was remarked by 
the lookers-on that Mr. Jefferson was the principal object of regard both 
to the members and spectators; that he seemed to be the chief mover 
of the body—the soul that animated it; and some who were present, 
struck by these manifestations of deference, conceived a more exalted 
36

idea of him on this simple and unpretending occasion than they had 
ever previously entertained,’ ” 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMISSIONERS. 
The proceedings and report of the commissioners are printed in full 
in the Analectic Magazine, Volume XIII, published in Philadelphia, 1819, 
a magazine to which Dr. Cooper was a contributor. It appears that 
Jefferson was unanimously elected president of the board. After some 
discussion, a committee of six, with Mr. Jefferson as chairman, was 
appointed to report on all the duties assigned to the commission by the 
Legislature, except that relating to the site. This subject was consid- 
ered by the entire board. Three places were proposed, Lexington, 
Staunton, and Central College. All three were acknowledged to be in 
healthful and fertile districts, but Jefferson is reputed to have made a 
point in favor of his neighborhood by exhibiting “an imposing list of 
octogenarians.” The question, however, turned mainly upon the relative 
degree of centrality. And here Jefferson had made his position impreg- 
nable. He showed the board by diagrams that Central College was 
well named, for it was not only geographically more central than any 
other college in Virginia, but it was actually nearest the centre of white 
population. 
These calculations were afterward published by Cabell in the Rich- 
mond Enquirer, December 17, 1818. There was then some bantering 
criticism of Jefferson’s method of drawing his two transverse lines in 
such a way that they intersected at Charlottesville. The point of de- 
parture for his westerly line was the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, 
which is much nearer the southern than the northern boundary of Vir- 
ginia; but Jefferson defended that point by saying, “the greatest part 
of what is north is water.” He did not draw his line due west, because 
the northern boundary of Virginia tended north of northwest. He dis- 
ereetly balanced his geography and followed the line of “ equal division 
of the population.” Nor did he draw a north and south line of inter- 
section. He found the Blue Ridge a natural line of cross division, and 
he sought a parallel course to that for his line of equal division of pop- 
ulation. Jefferson’s ingenious method of calculation is explained in a 
letter to Cabell, January 1, 1819, in which he took the bold ground, 
“Run your lines in what direction you please, they will pass close to 
Charlottesville.” Jefferson had no trouble in convincing the commis- 
sioners at Rockfish Gap, and, indeed, he was altogether fair in his gen- 
eral estimate of the geographical situation. A vote was taken, resulting 
in sixteen for Central College, three for Lexington,' and two for Staun- 
"1 Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, at Lexington, was at 
this juncture of affairs in the Legislature a more dangerous rival to Central College 
than was old William and Mary College, which came into politics a little later, and 
attempted to advance on Richmond, as elsewhere described in the author’s monograph 
on that venerable college. Washington College had developed from Liberty Hall

ton. Jefferson’s committee was instructed to include this expression of 
opinion in the report, which was made on the 3d of August, and, after 
sundry amendments, unanimously adopted. The next day two copies 
were signed by all the members present and were transmitted, one to 
the Speaker of the Senate and the other to the Speaker of the House. 
This report was probably prepared by Jefferson before he came to the 
meeting at Rockfish Gap, for it is an elaborate production, indicating 
careful thought. In the words of introductory comment in the Analectic 
Review, the report ‘“‘contains many novel suggestions worthy the atten- 
tion of our seminaries of learning already established.” A special 
consideration of some of Jefferson’s views will not be out of place in 
this study of his influence upon education in Virginia. 
AG JEFFERSON ON THE OBJECTS OF PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
Jefferson defined the objects of primary education as follows: 
“ (1). To give to every citizen the information he needs for the transac- 
tion 0 his own business ; 
«“(2) To enable him: to calculate for himself, and to express and pre- 
serve his ideas, his contracts and accounts, in writing ; 
“(3) To improve, by reading, his morals and faculties ; 2 
“(4) To understand his duties to his neighbors and country, and to 
discharge with competence the functions confided to him by either ; 
“(5) To know his rights; to exercise with order and justice those he 
retains; to choose with discretion the fiduciary of those he delegates ; 
and to notice their conduct with diligence, with candor, and judgment; 
“(6) And, in general, to observe with intelligence and faithfulness all 
the social relations under which he shall be placed.” 
For thus instructing the mass of citizens in their rights, interests, 
and duties, Jefferson maintained that primary schools, whether private   
Academy, founded in the year 1732. It had been endowed by George Washington with 
one hundred shares in the funds of the James River Company, his stock in the Potomac 
Company haying been reserved for the foundation of a national university in Wash- 
ington City, as described in the Johns Hopkins University Studies, third series, No. 1, 
pp. 93-5. The trustees of Washington College offered all of their funds, apparatus, 
books, grounds, etc., together with a subscription of nearly $18,000 by the people of 
Lexington and vicinity, and a deed of real estate amounting to over 3,350 acres, with 
all his personal property and fifty-seven slaves, promised by John Robinson, to the di- 
rectors of the literary fund, provided the university should be established in Lexing- 
tonor vicinity. Mr. Robinson’s proposed deed and gift were, however, subject ‘‘ to the 
payment of his debts and fulfilment of his contracts,” as Jefferson discreetly re- 
minded the Legislature. Over against the Lexington offer, which was altogether gen- 
erous, Central College placed its $41,248 in subscriptions, and $3,280 proceeds from the 
parish glebes; its grounds embracing 47 acres, ‘‘ whereon the buildings of the col- 
lege are begun, one pavilion and its appendix of dormitories being already far ad- 
vanced, and with one other pavilion, and equal annexation of dormitories, being ex- 
pected to be completed during the present season ;”’ and ‘another parcel of 153 acres 
near the former, and including a considerable eminence very favorable for the erec- 
tion of a future observatory.” This latter Jeffersonian idea has been realized since 
the War, by private philanthropy.

or public, should teach reading, writing, and arithmetic, the elements 
of mensuration, and the outlines of geography and history. These sug: 
gestions were skilfully inserted into the report, in order to remind the 
Legislature that something remained to be done for the people of Vir- 
ginia besides providing for the education of poor children. 
OBJECTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. xX 
Jefferson then proceeded to define the objects of the higher branches 
of education, and it is safe to say that the relation of universities to good 
citizenship and to the practical interests of American life has never 
been better formulated by any professional educator, much less have ~ 
these objects been concretely realized by any institution of learning. 
American colleges and universities will need to advance a long way 
before they reach the Jeffersonian ideal. He classifies the objects of 
the higher education as follows: 
“(1) To form the statesmen, legislators, and judges, on whom public 
prosperity and individual happiness are so much to depend ; 
(2) To expound the principles and structure of government, the laws 
which regulate the intercourse of nations, those formed municipally for 
our own government, and a sound spirit of legislation, which, banishing ~ 
all unnecessary restraint on individual action, shall leave us free to do 
whatever does. not violate the equal rights of another ; 
“(3) To harmonize and promote the interests of agriculture, manufact- 
ures, and commerce, and by well-informed views of political economy 
to give a free scope to the public industry ; 
“(4) To develop the reasoning faculties of our youth, enlarge their 
minds, cultivate their morals, and instil into them the precepts of vir- 
tue and order; 
(5) To enlighten them with mathematical and physical sciences, 
which advance the arts, and administer to the health, the subsistence, 
and comforts of human life; 
“ “(6) And, generally, to form them to habits of reflection and correct 
action, rendering them examples of virtue to others, and of happiness 
within themselves.” 
RELATION OF THE STATE TO SCIENCE. 
There is so much doubt in the mind of the average American citizen 
as to the duty of government to foster science and education of the 
highest sort, that it is worth while to call attention to the views of Jef- 
ferson upon this point. If the father of American democracy could 
entertain such views as these, thesons of the people need have no fears 
that the functions of the state are abused when directed toward the 
maintenance of a university or the advancement of science. Jefferson 
said, in his report to the Virginia Legislature : 
“ Some good men, and even of respectable information, consider the 
learned sciences as useless acquirements; some think that they do not 
better the condition of man; and others that education, like private 
and individual concerns, should be left to private individual effort ; not
-P-A-G-E-114

90 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
reflecting that an establishment embracing all the sciences which may 
be useful and even necessary in the various vocations of life, with the. 
buildings and apparatus belonging to each, are far beyond the reach 
of individual means, and must either derive existence from public 
patronage or not exist at all. This would leave us, then, without those 
callings which depend on education, or send us to other countries to 
seek the instruction they require. * * * Nor must we omitto mention 
the incalculable advantage of training up able counsellors to administer 
the affairs of our country in all its departments,—legislative, executive, 
and judicial, and to bear their proper share in the councils of our Na- 
tional Government; nothing more than education advancing the pros- 
perity, the power, and the happiness of a nation.” 
RELATION OF EDUCATION TO MORALS AND RELIGION. 
The strongest side of Jefferson’s educational philosophy was its bear- 
ing upon good morals and social progress. ‘‘ Education,” he said, “ gen- 
erates habits of application, of order, and the love of virtue; and con- 
trols, by the force of habit, any innate obliquities in our moral organi- 
zation. We should be far, too, from the discouraging persuasion that 
man is fixed, by the law of his nature, ata given point; that his im- 
provement is a chimera, and the hope delusive of rendering ourselves 
wiser, happier, or better than our forefathers were. As well might it 
be urged that the wild and uncultivated tree, hitherto yielding sour and 
bitter fruit only, can pever be made to yield better; yet we know that 
the grafting art implants a new tree on the savage stock, producing 
what is most estimable both in kind and degree. Education, in like 
manner, ingrafts a new man on the native stock, and improves what in 
his nature was vicious and perverse into qualities of virtue and social 
worth. And it can not be but that each generation, succeeding to the 
knowledge acquired by all those who preceded it, adding to it their own 
acquisitions and discoveries, and handing the mass down for successive 
and constant accumulation, must advance the knowledge and well-being 
of mankind, not injinitely, as some have said, but indefinitely, and to a 
term which no one can fix and foresee. * * * What but education 
has advanced us beyond the condition of our indigenous neighbors ? 
And what chains them to their present state of barbarism and wretched- 
ness but a bigoted veneration for the supposed superlative wisdom of 
their fathers, and the preposterous idea that they are to look backward 
for better things, and not forward, longing, as it should seem, to return 
to the days of eating acorns and roots, rather than indulge in the degen- 
eracies of civilization ?” 
Ethics occupied a prominent place in the plan for university educa- 
tion which Jefferson proposed to the Legislature. He recognized that 
under the Constitution of Virginia, which placed all religious sects upon 
an equal footing, it would be quite impossible to institute any sec- 
tarian theology. He proposed to place the éntire responsibility for re- 
ligious training upon: an ethical basis, where all sects could agree.
-P-A-G-E-115
  RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. 91 
He said: “The proofs of the being of a God, the creator, preserver, 
and supreme ruler of the universe, the author of all the relations of 
morality, and of the laws and obligations these infer, will be within 
the province of the professor of ethics; to which adding the develop- 
ments of these moral obligations, of those in which all sects agree, 
with a knowledge of the languages,—Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, a basis 
will be formed common to all sects.” Jefferson thought that it was the 
duty of each sect to provide its own theological teaching in a special 
school,! to which students might go for special instruction, as they did 
to their various denominational churches. An ethical solution of the 
theological questions in American universities has been found satisfac- 
tory in most of our State institutions, which have found themselves.   
1 In a letter to Dr. Cooper, November 2, 1822, Jefferson describes his plan of allow- 
ing independent schools of theology to be established in the neighborhood of the 
University. ‘In our University you know there is no professorship of divinity. A 
handle has been made of this to disseminate an idea that this is an institution, not. 
merely of no religion, but against all religion. Occasion was taken at the last meet- 
ing of the visitors to bring forward an idea that might silence this calumny, which 
weighed on the minds of some honest friends to the institution. In our annual re- 
port to the Legislature, after stating the constitutional reasons against a public estab- 
lishment of any religious instruction, we suggest the expediency of encouraging the 
different religious sects to establish each for itself professorship of their own tenets, 
on the confines of the University, so near as that their students may attend the lect- 
ures there, and have the free use of our library and every other accommodation we 
can give them; preserving, however, their independence of us and of each other. 
This fiils the chasm objected to ours, as a defect in an institution professing to give 
instruction in all useful sciences. I think the invitation will be accepted by some 
sects from candid intentions, and by others from jealousy and rivalship. And by 
bringing the sects together and mixing them with the mass of other students, we 
shall soften their asperities, liberalize and neutralize their prejudices, and make the 
general religion a religion of peace, reason, and morality.” 
The idea of a catholic grouping of theological seminaries around the University of 
Virginia was, of course, impracticable in a rural neighborhood, and it was never re- 
alized according to the Jeffersonian ideal. It is, perhaps, capable of an approximate 
fulfilment under modern conditions of university education in large municipal centres, 
where students naturally find their religious affiliations with their own form of church- 
life, and where connections are easily made which lead to special theological training 
upon the basis of a liberal education. A practical solution of the question of relig- 
ious services within the university was early found at the University of Virginia by 
the professors electing a university chaplain from year to year and from different relig- 
ious denominations—the Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Methodist, and Baptist. Other 
universities have come, each in its own way, to some such representative method of 
religious service. Harvard has its regular university preachers engaged from the Uni- 
tarian, Episcopalian, and Congregationalist denominations. Cornell has an eclectic 
system, and employs occasional preachers of recognized power and reputation. The 
Johns Hopkins University, in the city of Baltimore, is able approximately to realize 
the Jeffersonian ideal, and allow its students to seek such religious associations as 
family training or natural preference may incline them. It is the ‘ elective system” 
applied to church-going. City churches give university students free seats; and uni- 
versity students have, among themselves, organized Sunday afternoon services, at 
which city clergymen and university professors speak by special invitation. The 
idea of religious freedom is working itself out in university life, as it has already 
in the church and in the state. The exclusion of religion is not desired by any

under much the same stress of circumstances as did Jefferson amid 
the sects of Virginia. Moral science, social science, history, and the 
languages of the Old and New Testaments afford sufficiently solid and 
neutral foundations for all subsequent specialization in theology. 
JEFFERSON ON THE MODERN LANGUAGES AND ANGLO-SAXON. 
| 
While recommending the study of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew in the 
proposed university, together with his favorite groups of mathemati- 
eal, physical, scientific, political, legal, and philosophical studies, Jeffer- 
son takes special pains to urge the cultivation of the modern languages. 
His reasons for specifying French, Spanish, Italian, and German are in- 
teresting, but his early appreciation of the importance of Anglo-Saxon is 
especially striking, for this study had not yet found a place in America. 
He says: ‘‘ French is the language of general intercourse among nations, 
and as a depository of human science is unsurpassed by any other lan- 
guage, living or dead. Spanish is highly interesting to us as the lan- 
guage spoken by so great a portion of the inhabitants of our continents, 
with whom we shall probably have great intercourse ere long, and is 
that also in which is written the greater part of the early history of 
America. The Italian abounds with works of very superior order, val- 
uable for their matter, and still more distinguished as models of the 
finest taste in style and composition. And the German now stands in a 
line with that of the most learned nations in richness of erudition and 
advance in the sciences. It is, too, of common descent with the lan- 
guage of our own country, a branch of the same original Gothic stock, 
and furnishes valuable illustrations for us. But in this point of view, 
the Anglo-Saxon! is of peculiar value. We have placed it among the 
modern languages because it is, in fact, that which we speak, in the 
earliest form in which we have knowledge of it. It has been under- 
going with time those gradual changes which all languages, ancient 
and modern, have experienced; and even now needs only to be printed 
in the modern character and orthography to be intelligible, in a con-   
academic community. The introduction of religious liberty is what we need. That 
is the ideal which Jefferson attempted to realize amid great calumny and misinterpre- 
tation. And he, of all men, really solved the problem in the State of Virginia, by 
his statute for religious liberty, and prepared the way for its solution in all university 
education. 
1 There isan interesting article on ‘‘ Thomas Jefferson as a Philologist” in the Ameri- 
can Journal of Philology (Vol. III, No. 10, pp. 213-214), by Henry E. Shepherd, 
president of the College of the City of Charleston. ‘‘ By reference to pp. 417-418, 
Vol. VI, of Jefferson’s Works, it will be seen,” says Professor Shepherd, “ that Mr. 
Jefferson had remarkably clear and accurate views of the invigorating influence 
which dialects exert upon alanguage. In other words, Jefferson, writing about forty 
years before Max Miiller, seemed distinctly to apprehend the process which, in the 
technical language of modern philosophy, is known as ‘dialectic regeneration.’ He 
expresses himself as follows: ‘It is much to be wished that the publication of the 
present county dialects of England should go on. It will restore to us our language 
in all its shades of variation. It will incorporate into the present one all the riches 
of our ancient dialects; and what a store this will be may be seen by running the eye 
over the county glossaries, and observing the words we have lost by abandonment and

siderable degree, to the English reader. It has this value, too, above 
the Greek and Latin, that while it gives the radix of the mass of our 
language, they explain its innovations only. Obvious proofs of this have 
been presented to the modern reader in the disquisitions of John Horne 
Tooke ; and Fortescue Aland has well explained the great instruction 
which may be derived from it to a full understanding of our ancient 
common law, on which, as a stock, our whole system of law is engrafted.” 
Thus, in connection with the idea of historical study of our own English 
language, Jefferson came to the idea of English historical jurisprudence, 
which he recommended to Dr. Cooper, and the possibilities of which 
are just dawning upon students of the present generation. 
BODILY EXERCISE AND MANUAL TRAINING. 
It is interesting to note in Jefferson’s report the suggestion of cer- 
tain modern ideas of physical, manual, and artistic training now be- 
coming more and more prominent in our modern systems of education. 
“We have proposed,” he says, “no formal provision for the gymnastics 
of the school, although a proper object of attention for every institu- 
tion of youth. These exercises with ancient nations constituted the 
principal part of the education of their youth. Their arms and mode 
of warfare rendered them severe in the extreme; ours, on the same cor- 
rect principle, should be adapted to our arms and warfare; and the 
manual exercises, military manceuvres, and tactics generally should be 
the frequent exercises of the students in their hours of recreation. It 
is at that age of aptness, docility, and emulation of the practices of 
manhood that such things are soonest learned and longest remembered. 
The use of tools, too, in the manual arts is worthy of encouragement, 
by facilitating to such as choose it an admission into the neighboring 
workshops. To these should be added the arts which embellish life— 
dancing, music, and drawing; the last more especially as an important 
part of military education. These innocent arts furnish amusement 
and happiness to those who, having time on their hands, might less 
disuse, which in sound and sense are inferior to nothing we have retained. When 
these local vocabularies are published and digested together into a single one, it is 
probable we shall find that there is not a word in Shakespeare which is not now in 
use in some of the counties in England, from whence we may obtain its true sense.’ 
Mr. Jefierson’s views in regard to the relations of Anglo-Saxon to English are proba- 
bly better known to scholars than his opinions upon the points citedabove. He held 
that Anglo-Saxon was ‘Old English,’ and that it could be turned into intelligible 
English by simply divesting it of its antique orthography. He has given us some 
entertaining illustrations of the mode in which this transformation might be effected. 
His conception of Anglo-Saxon is in one aspect essentially the same as that held by the 
school of Freeman, Morris, and Sweet in our own time. The process by which he arrives 
at his conclusions is of course different from that adopted by scientific philology. 
During the recent visit of Mr. Edward A. Freeman to Baltimore, I showed him Mr. 
Jefierson’s essay on the Anglo-Saxon, which was published by the board of trustees 
for the University of Virginia in 1851. He examined it with great interest, and upon 
returning it remarked: ‘Jefferson had the right view. It [Anglo-Saxon] is only 
Old English.’ He further remarked: ‘It seems so strange to see Jefferson quoting 
Bosworth. It is like Washington quoting Stubbs.’”  
-P-A-G-E-118

inoffensively employ it. Needing, at the same time, no regular incor- 
poration with the institution, they may be left to accessory teachers, 
who will be paid by the individuals employing them, the university 
only providing proper apartments for their exercise.” Jefferson had 
somewhat the same ideas of the relation of bodily accomplishments to 
the higher education as have long prevailed at West Point and in Ger- 
man universities. In the matter of physical training, American univer- 
sities have advanced far beyond the Jeffersonian ideal, but there is still 
great room for improvement in the training of bodily powers to some 
useful or artistic end, as in drawing and other skilled exercise of the 
hand and eye. 
JEFFERSON ON STUDENT SELF-GOVERNMENT. 
It is very generally known that at the University of Virginia exists 
a remarkable system of student self-government, by which a high morale 
and a manly tone of self-reliance have been successfully maintained. 
In sharp distinction to the old-time method of tutorial supervision 
and professorial espionage, this system of self-government has devel- 
oped the most honorable relations between faculty and students. It has 
established a frank and kindly spirit of co-operation between master 
and pupil. It has repressed all dishonorable practices of cheating in 
recitations and examinations, so common under the old reign of terror, 
and it has promoted a spirit of independence and self-respect. This 
condition of student society in Virginia is in no small degree the re- 
sult of the teachings of Jefferson. While his ideal of student self- 
government was not immediately realized in that lawless period fol- 
lowing the first introduction of his ideas, yet a wholesome harmony 
between liberty and law was soon and easily secured. In the light 
of modern tendencies towards constitutional and self-government in 
American colleges and universities, the following extract from Jeffer- 
sov’s report may prove interesting : 
“The best mode of government for youth in large collections is cer- 
tainly a desideratum not yet attained with us. It may be well ques- 
tioned whether fear, after a certain age, is a motive to which we should 
have ordinary recourse. The human character is susceptible of other 
incitements to correct conduct more worthy of employ, and of better 
effect. Pride of character, laudable ambition, and moral dispositions 
are innate correctives of the indiscretions of that lively age; and when 
strengthened by habitual appeal and exercise, have a happier effect on 
future character than the degrading motive of fear. Hardening them 
to disgrace, to corporal punishments, and servile humiliations can not 
be the best process for producing erect character. The affectionate de- 
portment between father and son offers, in truth, the best example for 
that of tutor and pupil; and the experience of other countries, in this 
respect, may be worthy of inquiry and consideration with us.” 
Jefferson adds, in a foot-note, that “‘a police exercised by the stu- 
dents themselves, under proper diseretion, has been tried with success
-P-A-G-E-119
  STUDENT SELF-GOVERNMENT. 95 
in some countries, and the rather as forming them for initiation into the 
duties and practices of civil life.”. This idea of student self-govern- 
ment, borrowed from academic centres in the old world, where college 
and university government has always been more democratic than in 
America, was successfully planted by Jefferson in Virginia, and it is 
destined to spread throughout the country. It has sprung up, appar- 
ently by spontaneous generation, in certain of our colleges, and it has 
long survived as a precious inheritance in certain of our public schools, 
based upon the best old English models. 5 
SUMMARY OF JEFFERSON'S REPQRT. 
All of the foregoing special views upon the subject of education Jef- 
ferson contrived to introduce into the body of his report. Upon the 
five specific points actually referred to the commissioners for their opin- 
ion, the following summary statement may be made: 
(1) Central College was recommended as the proper site of the uni- 
versity. 
(2) The plan of building proposed was that of an academical village, 
with pavilions for the professors and ranges of dormitories for the stu- 
dents, the buildings to be arranged on the sides of “a lawn,” and to be 
connected by “a passage of some kind, under cover from the weather.” 
This Jeffersonian style of university construction has been described in 
connection with Albemarle Academy and Central College. 
(3) The branches of learning to be taught were those heretofore rec- 
ommended by Jefferson, but now arranged in ten homogeneous groups,

  CHAPTER VIL. 
ESTABLISHMENT -AND BUILDING OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
Jefferson’s report was transmitted to the speaker of the Senate 
through Cabell, who was the original mover of the Rockfish Gap com- 
mission. Early in Becember, as appears from Cabell’s letter to his 
friend, ‘the report was read and received with great attention in both 
the houses. A resolution to print a number of copies passed each house. 
The ability and value of the report, I am informed, are universally ad- 
mitted. It was referred in the lower house to a select committee, and 
the speaker is friendly to the measure. Present prospects are very 
favorable to a successful issue.” 
OPPOSITION TO THE UNIVERSITY IDEA. 
But a strong opposition to Jefferson’s project was speedily developed. 
A bill which he had prepared was reported by the House committee by 
a bare majority of one, ‘the casting vote of the chairman.” Then be- 
gan the fight. The western members from the Valley of Virginia and 
the friends of Staunton determined to defeat the university altogether. 
The Lexington party sought for delay, threw discredit upon Jefferson’s 
calculations as to the centrality of his college, and sought to re-enforce 
their own claims. Delay endangered the bill. Cabell wrote: “The hos- 
tile interests are daily acquiring new force by intrigue and management. 
The party opposed altogether to the university is growing so rapidly 
we have just grounds to fear a total failure of the measure. * * * 
The friends of William and Mary demand $5,000 per annum as the price 
ot their concurrence, and in the event of a refusal will carry off some 
votes. Ihave advised my friends not to enter into any compacts of 
the kind, and sooner will I lose the bill than I will give my assent to it.” 
Members of the Legislature from the region of William and Mary became 
the most determined opponents of the bill. Cabell, said the better edu- 
eated part of them, had studied at this institution, and quoted Adam 
Smith, the Edinburgh Review, and Dugald Stewart to prove that educa- 
tion should be left to individual enterprise. Others, more ignorant, 
maintained that the literary fund was about to be diverted from its 
original object, the education of the poor, and applied for the benefit of 
the rich. Some liberal and enlightened persons thought Charlottesville 
too small a place for a university. “They think a town of some size 
necessary to attract professors, to furnish polished society for the stu- 
dents, to supply accommodations, to resistthe physical force, and present 
the means of governing a large number of young men.”

OPPOSITION TO THE UNIVERSITY. 97 
SERVICES OF CABELL. 
Cabell determined to break down the general opposition. He went 
about from man to man, laboring to convert them to his views. He 
“passed the night in watchful reflection and the day in ceaseless ac- 
tivity.” He published articles in the Richmond Enquirer calculated to 
influence public opinion. Jefferson’s proofs of the central situation of 
the proposed university were published by Cabell and explained to 
everybody. He even wrote to liberally minded and influential men in 
the various localities whence the opposition proceeded, and persuaded 
them to write to their representatives in the Legislature urging a favor- 
able vote. He actually districted the entire country east of the Blue 
Ridge, and moved the very ground from beneath the feet of the oppo- 
sition by an appeal to loca! good sense. The chief trouble lay with the 
House of Delegates, which was made up of somewhat Philistine ele- 
ments; but Cabell, by his skilful tactics, at last won over the majority 
to his opinion. On the 18th of January, 1819, a motion in the House to 
strike Central College from the bill was lost by a vote of 114 to 69, “a 
decisive victory,” wrote Cabell. Mr. Baldwin, of Augusta, one of the 
leaders of the western opposition, then rose and made an eloquent plea 
for unanimity of action and for the suppression of local prejudice. He 
said he had supported Staunton as long as there was any hope of suc- 
cess, but now he implored the House ‘‘to sacrifice all sectional feel- 
ing.”! Democracy united in a sudden rush of good feeling, and Jeffer- 
son’s cause was overwhelmingly won. Cabell was so excited that he 
had to leave the House before the final vote was takep. He had been 
suffering two days before from hemorrhage of the lungs, “brought on 
by exposure to bad weather and loss of sleep;” but he was now victo- 
rious; he had fought a good fight and had kept his faith in the people. 
It was a foregone conclusion that Jefferson’s bill would pass the Sen- 
ate, where Cabell was a very influential member. On the 25th of Janu- 
ary, 1819, the University of Virginia and Central College were legally 
united by a vote of twenty-two to one. 
The seal of the University—‘‘ a Minerva enrobed in her peplum and 
characteristic habiliments as inventress and protectress of the arts”’— 
bears the date of 1819, which should be reckoned as the year of origin, 
although the institution was not formally opened to students until 1825. 
SERVICES OF OTHER MEN. 
Cabell wrote in triumph to Jefferson, December 4, 1819: * We have 
got possession of the ground, and it will never be taken from us.” He said 
the enlightened part of the people everywhere were in favor of the uni- 
versity establishment. Such acomplete conquest of public opinion was 
very remarkable, and it could have been gained only by the hearty co- 
operation of intelligent men in many local centres of influence. In the

versity by Judge Baldwin, General Breckenridge, and Mr. Johnson.

above letter Cabell pays an honest tribute of gratitude to the gentle- 
men in the various counties who had aided him in the Legislature and 
among the people. For example, he says: “‘ We are very much indebted 
to Mr. Taliaferro and Colonel Green for the favorable change in the 
delegation north of the James River and below tide-water. At Christ- 
mas, every member from Richmond to Hampton, except one, was op- 
posed to us. On the vote, all went with us, except one.” Cabell 
acknowledges also the efficient services of Captain Slaughter, of Cul- 
peper; Judge Brooke, Judge Brockenbrough, Mr. Stanard, Mr. Ritchie, 
Mr. Hoomes, of King and Queen; Dr. Nicholson, of Middlesex; Mr. 
Scott, of the Council; Mr. Minor, of Spottsylvania; Judge Roane, 
Colonel Nicholas, William Cabell (the brother of Joseph), Chancellor 
Taylor, Mr. Pannill, and others. Mr. Francis W. Gilmer did valuable 
work for Central College through the press. The Rev. John H. Rice, 
a Presbyterian clergyman in Richmond, also lent important literary 
aid. He was the author of an article signed “ Crito,” the following 
passage of which is thought to have exercised great influence upon the 
public mind, through Cabell’s frequent use of the facts stated: 
“Ten years ago,” said Mr. Rice, ‘‘ I made extensive inquiries on the 
subject, and ascertained to my conviction that the amount of money 
annually carried from Virginia, for purposes of education alone, ex- 
ceeded $250,000. Since that period it has been greater. Take a quar- 
ter of a million as the average of the last eight-and-twenty years, and 
_ the amount is the enormous sum of $7,000,000. But had our schools 
been such as the resources of Virginia would have well allowed, and 
her honor and interest demanded, it is by no means extravagant to sup- 
pose that the five States which bind on ours would have sent as many 
students to us, as under the present wretched system, we have sent to 
them. This, then, makes another amount of seven millions. Let our 
economists look to that—fourteen millions of good dollars lost to us by 
our parsimony! Let our wise men calculate the annual interest of our 
losses, and add it to this principal! They will then see what are the 
fruits of this precious speculation.” 
Such arguments, no doubt extravagant, had their weight in favora- 
bly balancing the university question in the scales of public opinion. 
Although Thomas Jefferson is undoubtedly “ the founder of the Univer- 
sity of Virginia,” we should not forget that there were a thousand his- 
toric forces without which his ideas would have failed of realization.'   
1 At the Boston meeting of the American Historical Association in May, 1887, Mr. 
James Schouler, author of a remarkable History of the United States, read a paper 
upon the subject of ‘‘ Historical Grouping,” in which he advised a study of the minor 
forces and subordinate characters which enter into great events and the work of great 
men. Individuals are, indeed, the highest expression of human thought and social 
action; but there is always a background of support without which the deeds of a 
Washington are incomprehensible, and thus it was with Jefferson’s university crea- 
tion. Without the aid of Cabell, it is perfectly clear that Jefferson would have been 
helpless, and back of Cabell were the Virginia Legislature and the common people.

  THE UNIVERSITY ESTABLISHED. oo 
SUMMARY OF JEFFERSON’S BILL, 1819. 
The act establishing the University of Virginia in definite form pro- 
vided for the acceptance by the State of the property of Central College, 
conveyed to the president and directors of the literary fund, which was 
really a board of public instruction. Seven visitors were to-be ap- 
pointed forthwith by the Governor of the State, and they were to have 
authority to choose a rector from their own number, and to control the 
general interests of the University. The provisions for instruction were 
much the same as in Jefferson’s report. The various branches of 
science were to be distributed among ten professorships. Each profes- 
sor should have apartments free, and those first appointed, such salary 
as the visitors might determine; their successors, however, a standing 
salary not exceeding $1,000 a year; but all professors should have such 
fees from students as the visitors might allow. The visitors were to 
hold two stated meetings each year, in April and in October; to visit 
the University once a year, and to report annually to the president and 
directors of the literary fund. Such, in general, was the legal basis of 
the University of Virginia. It was generally understood that the re- 
port of the Rockfish Gap commission was to be the accepted platform of 
the university party. That “plan,” said Jefferson in 1821, “was ex- 
actly that now carried into execution.” The significance of previous 
inquiries into the details of that report is now, therefore, clearly appar. 
ent, for we have already seen on paper the whole substructure and the 
detailed plans of the University of Virginia. 
JEFFERSON THE FIRST RECTOR. 
The visitors appointed for the University of Virginia comprised four 
members of the old board representing Central College, namely: Thomas 
Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph ©. Cabell, and John H. Cocke. The 
hew appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and 
Robert Taylor. They met March 29, 1819, and chose Thomas Jefferson 
to be their rector, as he had been of the former board. Henceforth, 
until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the directirg and shaping power 
in the upbuilding of the University of Virginia. From his original and 
sovereign interest in university education, and from his residence in 
immediate proximity to the University, the other visitors were well con- 
tent to leave to him practically the entire management of affairs. Never 
was an institution more completely the materialization of one man’s 
thought than isthe University of Virginia. Not only did he evolve the 
entire system of education there introduced, but he actually devised 
every feature of construction and administration. He drew plans, 
made estimates and contracts, busied himself about bricks and mortar, 
and superintended the whole process of building. 
BUILDING POLICY. 
The gradual rise of the University of Virginia can be best reviewed 
in the proceedings and annual reports of the board of visitors, and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  
100 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
Jetferson’s correspondence with Cabell and other personal friends. The 
original visitors of Central College were empowered by Jefferson’s bill 
to continue their functions until the first meeting of their successors. 
This gave a fine opportunity ‘of expediting the objects of said institu- 
tion.” The old board met for the lasttime February 26, 1819, and voted 
to apply all available funds toward the erection of additional buildings 
for the accommodation of professors and students. 
It was Jefferson’s policy, from the beginning, to push forward the 
material construction of the University; tomake it an accomplished fact, 
and thus an influence in appealing to the public imagination and to legis- 
lative support. It was perhaps a necessary policy in the early history 
of the University, before its pre-eminence over rivals and its superiority 
to all opposition was fully established. There was absolutely nothing 
in the neighborhood of Charlottesville to attract either professors or 
students. Jefferson was compelled, by the necessities of the situation, 
to create something visible and impressive which should compel admira- 
tion. Jefferson defined his building policy in a letter to Cabell, Decem- 
ber 28, 1822, in which it appears that he regarded a good material basis 
for the University as necessary to its intellectual superstructure. Jef: 
ferson said: ‘‘The great object of our aim from the beginning has been 
to make the establishment the most eminent in the United States, in 
order to draw to it the youth of every State, but especially of the South 
and West. We have proposed, therefore, to call to it characters of the 
first order of science from Europe, as well as our own country, and not 
only by the salaries and the comforts of their situation, but by the dis- 
tinguished scale of its structure and preparation, and the promise of 
future eminence which these would hold up, to induce them to commit 
their reputation to its future fortunes. Had we built a barn for a college 
and log huts for accommodations, should we ever have had the assurance 
to propose to an European professor of that character to come to it ?” 
Cabell also was thoroughly convinced of the soundness of the build- 
ing policy of the University. Even the enemies of the institution 
acknowledged that Jefferson’s course was wise. President Smith, of 
William ana Mary College, and Judge Semple, of Williamsburg, said 
that “ Virginians would never be pleased with anything on a small 
scale.” The judge confessed to Cabell that an influential politician 
from Charles City had been won over to the University by a mere visit 
of inspection, which impressed him with ‘the extent and splendor of 
the establishment.” Undoubtedly Jefferson’s building policy served an 
excellent purpose, politically and educationally, but candid students of 
the history of the University must admit that he carried his architect- 
ural crotchets rather too far for the best economy of slender educational — 
resources. | 
ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
Jefferson early conceived the ingenious idea that college buildings 
should afford perpetual object lessons to students in the right principles

of architecture. This idea, excellent in itself, was difficult for Jefferson 
to realize according to his classic ideals, for, unlike Pericles, he could 
not fully command the public treasury. Itis interesting, historically, to 
note the beginning of Jefferson’s architectural project. In the proceed- 
ings of the visitors of Central College, July 28, 1817, it is agreed ‘that 
it is expedient to import a stone-cutter from Italy, and that Mr. Jeffer- 
son be authorized and requested to take the requisite measures to effect 
that object.” The intention was to have chiselled capitals for the col- 
umns of the pavilions, or professors’ houses, and to make their porticos 
illustrate Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders of architecture. Two 
“Italian artists” were accordingly imported, and they proceeded to 
chisel the stone of Virginia into classic forms. At the second meeting 
of the visitors of the University in 1819, it was voted “ that as the stone 
in the neighborhood of the University is found not capable of being 
wrought into capitals for the columns of some of the pavilions, and it 
may be necessary to procure elsewhere proper stone or marble, and 
to have such capitals executed here or elsewhere, the proctor be au- 
thorized to take such measures relative thereto,” etc. The proctor was 
the business agent of the University and Jefferson’s right-hand man. 
The above resolution prepared the way for having the capitals cut in 
Italy, from excelient marble, and imported, like the original master 
workman, or “our artist,” with whom Jefferson settled for $1,390.56, 
including “ his past wages, his board, and passage hither.” The seven- 
teen capitals cost by contract but a trifle over $2,000, and no one who 
has ever visited the University of Virginia will feel disposed to find 
fault with Mr. Jefferson for indulging in these inexpensive architectu- 
ral luxuries, which are among the most charming features of that origi- 
nal creation. 
PAVILIONS COMPLETED. 
In the third annual report, 1821, to the president and directors of 
the literary fund, Jefferson stated that “ the visitors, considering as 
the law of their duty the report of the commissioners of 1818, which was 
made to the Legislature, and acted on by them from time to time sub- 
sequently, have completed all the buildings proposed by that report, 
except one; that is to say, ten distinct houses or pavilions containing 
each a lecturing room, with generally four other apartments for the ac- 
commodation of a professor and his family, and with a garden and the 
requisite family offices; six hotels for dieting the students, with a single 
room in each for a refectory, and two rooms, a garden, and offices for 
the tenant; and an hundred and nine dormitories, sufficient each for the 
accommodation of two students, arranged in four distinct rows between 
the pavilions and hotels, and united with them by covered ways; which 
buildings are all in readiness for occupation, except that there is still 
some plastering to be done, now on hand, which will be finished early 
in the present season, the garden grounds and garden walls to be com- 
pleted, and some columns awaiting their capitals, not yet received from

Italy.” Here is the picture of an academical village, taking form and 
comeliness according to original designs first conceived by Jefferson for 
Albemarle Academy. 
CosT OF THE PAVILIONS. 
According to Jefferson’s third annual report, 1821, the ten pavilions 
for the professors cost something over $86,000. The one hundred and 
nine dormitories for the students required an outlay of about $65,000. 
The six “hotels,” or boarding-houses; were estimated at $24,000. 
For back yards and gardens $1,500 were allowed. The entire expendi- 
ture proposed for buildings, lands, labor, etc., was reckoned at some- 
thing over $207,000. The final cost} proved much more than that 
amount. The library building, with its dome, proved very expensive. 
Jefferson continued to report progress from year to year until 1825, 
when the University was opened to students. He early declared in 
favor of prudent delay in organizing instruction. He said in his fourth 
report, 1822: ‘The visitors, from the beginning, have considered it in- 
dispensable to complete all the buildings before opening the institution; 
because, from the moment that it shall be opened, the whole income of 
the University will be absorbed by the salaries of the professors and 
other incidental and current expenses, and nothing will remain to erect 
any buildings still want:ng to complete the system.” 
JEFFERSON'S FINANCIAL POLICY. 
One of the most extraordinary features of Jefferson’s management of 
the University was his financial policy. To begin with, he had persuaded 
the Legislature to adopt Central College, with its modest fortune of 
$41,000, chiefly in unpaid subscriptions, and with its three thousand and 
odd dollars arising from the sale of glebe lands. In 1821, as appears 
from Jefferson’s own report, only about $25,000 of the above subscrip- 
tion money had been collected. The balance was for the most part 
deemed good, but it appears to have come in slowly and to have suf- 
fered some losses from the removal or insolvency of certain subscribers. 
In 1823 Jefferson estimated the probable loss at 6 per cent. of the 
$43,808 up to that time subscribed. But he more than made up for any 
such trifling disappointment by securing money from the Legislature, 
The annual appropriation originally made to the University from the 
income of the literary fund was only $15,000 a year. Of course it was 
impossible to build, organize, and equip a real university upon such 
meagre resources. But Jefferson and Cabell were good politicians. 
They took what they could get, and then asked for more. Jefferson’s 
financial policy in dealing with the Legislature of Virginia was some- 
thing like the camel’s method of entering an Arab’s tent, or like a wood- 
man’s method of splitting a log. To follow one’s nose, or to drive a 
1Niles’s Register for March 4, 1826, estimates the total cost at about $400,000,  
-P-A-G-E-129
JEFFERSON'S FINANCIAL POLICY. , 108 
wedge is a very simple procedure, but it sometimes requires discre- 
tion. Jefferson had it. The entire income of the literary fund was 
about $60,000 a year. Of this amount $45,000 annually was appro- 
priated for the education of poor children. This sum was not entirely 
exhausted by the demands of local commissioners, and Jefferson asked 
for the surplus. Through Cabell he tried again to establish common 
schools upon a self-supporting basis, and to liberate the entire fund. 
Failing in this excellent project, he did the next best thing. He bor- 
rowed the fund; that is, as much as he could obtain on legislative au- 
thority at one time, and pledged the annual appropriation of $15,000 
for payment. The first loan amounted to $60,000. When this was 
exhausted, Jefferson asked the Legislature for another loan. This 
process was repeated until he had borrowed from the literary fund 
$180,000. There was, of course, but one end to all this, and that was 
legislative relief for the university debt. Cabell supported Jefferson’s 
financial policy in the strongest way. As early as December 23, 1822, 
he wrote to Jefferson: ‘Let us have nothing to do with the old bal- 
ances, or dead horses, or escheated lands, but ask boldly to be exon- 
erated from our debts by the powerful sinking fund of the State. This 
is manly and dignified legislation; and if we fail, the blame will not be 
ours.” 
Jefferson’s financial policy is illustrated in the following naive state- 
ment to the managers of the literary fund, in his fifth annual report, 1823: 
“The several sums advanced from the literary fund as loans, when 
the balance of the last shall have been received, will amount to $180,000, 
bearing a present interest of $10,800. This, with the cost and neces- 
sary care and preservation of the establishment, will leave, of the an- 
nual endowment of the University, a surplus of between two and three 
thousand dollars ouly. As before mentioned, this loan of $180,000 will 
be extinguished by an annual payment ofa constant sum of $2,500, at 
theend of twenty-five years—a term too distant for the education of any 
person already born, or to be born for some time to come, and within 
that period a great expense will be incurred in the mere preserva- 
tion of the buildings and appurtenances. These are views which it is 
the duty of the visitors to present, and to leave to the wisdom and pa- 
ternal consideration of the Legislature, to whose care are confided the 
instruction and other interests of the present, as well as of future gener- 
ations proceeding from us.” 
THE UNIVERSITY FREED FROM DEBT. 
On the 27th of January, 1824, the Legislature voted to liberate the 
annual appropriation to the University from the incumbrances with 
which it was charged. This generous action, which the State could 
well afford from the surplus accruing to the literary fund from the 
United States Government and other sources, left immediately availa- 
ble, after all university debts had been paid, $21,000 toward the com-

pletion of the library or central academic building, upon which nearly 
$20,000 had already been expended. It left the annuity of $15,000 for 
the year 1824 altogether clear for current expenses and the salaries of 
professors, for whose engagement Jefferson had that year sent to Bu- 
rope Mr. Francis W. Gilmer, ‘a learned and trustworthy citizen.” 
Jefferson’s financial policy was grossly misrepresented the last year 
of his life by a contributor to the Richmond Enquirer, February 4, 1826, 
who called himself an “American Citizen.” He professed to have paid 
a visit to Jefferson at Monticello, and to have had a familiar talk with 
him about his method of obtaining money from the Legislature. Being 
asked why he had not asked for a lump sum, Jefferson is reported to 
have said jocosely, that no one liked to have more than one hot potato 
at a time crammed down his throat. This story naturally offended the 
politicians and seriously injured the pecuniary prospects of the Uni- 
versity. Jefferson was highly indignant at the gossip, and repudiated 
the insinuations made by the tattling correspondent. Jefferson wrote 
to Cabell, February 7, 1826: “‘He makes me declare that I have inten- 
tionally proceeded in a course of dupery of our Legislature, teasing 
them, as he makes me say, for six or seven sessions for successive aids 
to the University, and asking a part only at a time, and intentionally 
concealing the ultimate cost, and gives an inexact statement of a story 
of Obrian. Now, our annual reports will shew that we constantly gave 
full and candid accounts of the money expended, and statemeuts of 
what might still be wanting, founded on the proctor’s estimates. No 
man ever heard me speak of the grants of the Legislature but with 
acknowledgments of their liberality, which I have always declared 
had gone far beyond what I could have expected in the beginning. 
Yet the letter-writer has given to my expressions an aspect disrespectful 
of the Legislature, and calculated to give them offence, which I do ab- 
solutely disavow.” 
But it was impossible to counteract the impression made by that an- 
cient political anecdote, in which there was just enough truth to put 
Jefferson in an unfavorable light before the public.’ And yet his de- 
fence was perfectly sound. No man ever approached a Legislature in 
a more frank and manly way, stating fairly and fully what he had done 
and what he wanted todo. He even acknowledged the mistakes he had 
made in importing Italian sculptors and in engaging Dr. Cooper before 
the University was able to pay his salary. In reading his annual re- 
ports to the president and directors of the literary fund, one can not 
fail to be astonished at the minuteness of detail and the completeness 
of statement with reference to the use made of every appropriation for 
the University. His method of modest and repeated applications to   
1Contemporary public opinion concerning Jefferson’s undertaking is well illustrated 
in the following extract from the Richmond Whig, quoted in Niles’s Register, March 
4, 1826: ‘Much of the popularity which the institution might and ought to have en- 
joyed has been frittered away by incessant demands for pecuniary aid, anti-republican 
and meretricious ornament, and injudicious selections of professors,”  
-P-A-G-E-131
  
JEFFERSON'S FINANCIAL POLICY. 105 
the Legislature was the only practicable way of building up a great 
State university from small beginnings at that period, when public 
opinion was unfavorable to higher educational enterprise. Sooner or 
later all the friends of public education will learn that a frank and hon- 
est appeal to the public through the Legislature, or to representatives 
of the people, is quite as honorable business as begging money from pri- 
vate individuals for institutions of learning. Both methods will endure, 
and both are equally legitimate; but the era of democratic support of 
university education has dawned in many States, and it will not de- 
cline before individual or sectarian endowments, however generous. 
Institutions like the University of Virginia and the University of 
“Michigan are destined to live and to grow from more to more.

THE FIRST PROFESSORS. 
DR. KNOX, OF BALTIMORE. 
The first professor for the Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, 
Was obtained from the University of Virginia, and the first professor for 
Jefferson’s original institution was sought in Baltimore. On the 28th 
of July, 1817, the visitors of Central College agreed ‘that applica- 
tion be made to Dr. Knox, of Baltimore, to accept the professorship 
of languages, belles-lettres, rhetoric, history, and geography; and 
that an independent salary of $500, with a perquisite of $25 from each 
pupil, together with chambers for his accommodation, be allowed him 
as a compensation for his services, he finding the necessary assistant 
ushers.” Here was theoretical provision for an entire faculty, if Dr. 
Knox had been willing to exercise the appointing power, pay his own 
faculty, and teach all the humanities for $500 a year. We are not 
much surprised to learn from a letter of Jefferson’s to Cabell, Septem- 
ber 10, 1817, that “Dr. Knox has retired from business, and I have 
written to Cooper.” 
DR. THOMAS COOPER. 
On the 7th of October the visitors rescinded their original appoint- 
ment and resolved to offer the first professorship to Dr. Thomas Cooper, 
of Pennsylvania, from whom Jefferson had received an encouraging 
letter. Cooper was elected to the chair of chemistry, to which was 
added provisionally the chair of law, with a fixed salary of $1,000 a 
year and tuition fees of $20 from each of his students. If Dr. Cooper 
accepted, it was resolved to appoint a professor of mathematics. Writ- 
ing to Cabell, December 18, 1817, Jefferson speaks of “a letter Ihave 
just received from Dr. Cooper, engaging himself for our physiological 
and law schools.” 
At the first meeting of the visitors of the University, March 29, 1819, 
Dr. Cooper, “ heretofore appointed professor of chemistry and of law 
for the Central College,” was confirmed university professor of chemis- 
try, mineralogy, natural philosophy, and also of law, until the develop- 
ment of the institution and the increase of students should justify a sep- 
arate appointment to the latter chair. As we have already seen in Jef- 
ferson’s correspondence with Cooper, the latter was an accomplished 
lawyer, as well as one of the ablest men of his time in p hysical science.

in Publie Education,” by Samuel Knox, 31 East Street, Baltimore.

PROFESSOR THOMAS COOPER. 107 
In view of the extraordinary amount of work which the first professor 
was to undertake, it was voted that, in additioi! to his regular salary 
of $1,500, he should receive such an extra allowance as would make his 
income, including tuition fees, not less than $3,500 a year. The Uni- 
‘versity agreed to take his apparatus at cost, and 2,500 specimens from 
his mineralogical collection. Dr. Cooper was in position to dictate his 
own terms, for at this juncture his services were demanded in New 
York by Governor Clinton, also in Philadelphia, and at the same time 
in New Orleans. Jefferson said enthusiastically of his first professor: 
“Cooper is acknowledged by every enlightened man who knows him 
to be the greatest man in America in the powers of his mind and in 
acquired information, and that without a single exception.”! 
OPPOSITION TO DR. COOPER. 
This first appointment to the faculty created a decided opposition on 
the part of many real friends of the University. Cooper’s religious views. 
proved for him a stumbling-block. He was known to have been obnox- 
ious to the prevailing religious sentiment of England, and partly for that 
reason to have sought refuge in America. Prejudice and suspicion were 
naturally aroused against him in orthodox and conservative Virginia. 
Cooper had supplied an arsenal of attack upon his philosophical and 
religious opinions by editing and annotating the writings of his father- 
in-law, Dr. Priestley. Dr. John Rice,’ the editor of a religious magazine 
which was published in Richmond, and one of the original promoters of 
the University, led the crusade against Cooper in a critical article based 
upon extracts from Cooper’s own writings, which, in the judgment of 
many, were sufficient to condemn him. The clergy of Virginia could 
not be oblivious to the danger of introducing among Virginia youth a 
propagandist of new and strange doctrines, as Cooper’s views appeared 
to the men of his generation. So much pressure was exerted upon 
public opinion, and through it upon Cooper himself, that he felt con- 
strained to offer his resignation, which, after honorable treatment by 
the board of visitors, was finally accepted in 1820. From an economic 
point of view this arrangement was altogether wise, for the University 
needed every dollar for building purposes, and was not ready for stu- 
dents until five years after this unfortunate affair. 
JEFFERSON ON THE LOSS OF DR. COOPER. 
The loss of Dr. Cooper, the first appointed professor of the Univer- 
sity of Virginia, was a heavy blow to its founder, and moved him to re-   
1 Correspondence of Jefferson and Cabell, 169. Interesting references to Cooper 
occur also on pp. 164, 165, 167, 169, 172, 178, 234, 235, 397-399, 454, 458, and 469. 
2A strong defence of Dr. Rice and of the Presbyterian party which, under his leader. 
ship, opposed the appointment of Dr. Cooper, may be found in the Correspondence of 
Jefferson and Cabell, pp. 234, 235, notes. The spirit of the age is perhaps explana- 
tion enough. ‘The Presbyterians were among the dissenters who made a State uni- 
versity possible in distinction from William and Mary College, which was Episcopa~ 
lian, but they were not prepared for such extremes of dissent as were represented by 
Dr. Cooper.

peated? expressions of indignation in private letters to his friends. In 
aletter to General Taylor, May 16, 1820, Jefferson said : 
“You may have heard of the hue and ery raised from the different 
pulpits on our appointment of Dr. Cooper, whom they charge with 
Unitarianism as boldly as if they knew the fact, and as presumptuously 
asif it were a crime, and one for which, like Servetus, he should be 
burned; and perhaps you may have seen the particular attack made 
on him in the Evangelical Magazine. For myself, I was not disposed 
to regard the denunciations of these satellites of religious inquisition ; 
but our colleagues, better judges of popular feeling, thought that they 
were not to be altogether neglected, and that it might be better to re- 
lieve Dr. Cooper, ourselves, and the institution from this crusade. I 
had received a letter from him expressing his uneasiness, not only for 
himself, but lest this persecution should become embarrassing to the 
visitors and injurious to the institution, with an offer to resign if we had 
the sameapprehensions. The visitors, therefore, desired the committee 
of superintendence to place him at freedom on this subject, and to ar- 
range with him a suitable indemnification. I wrote accordingly, in an- 
swer to his, and a meeting of trustees of the college at Columbia [S. C.] 
happening to take place soon after his receipt of my letter, they re- 
solved unanimously that it should be proposed to, and urged on, their 
Legislature to establish a professorship of geology and mineralogy, or 
a professorship of law, with a salary of $1,000 a year to be given him, in 
addition to that of chemistry, which is $2,000 year and to purchase his 
collection of minerals; and they have no doubt of the Legislature’s com- 
pliance. On the subject of indemnification, he is contented with the 
balance of the $1,500 we had before agreed to give him, and which he 
says will not more than cover his actual losses of time and expense. He 
adds: ‘It is right I should acknowledge the liberality of your board 
with thanks. I regret the storm that has been raised on my account, 
for it has separated me from many fond hopes and wishes. Whatever 
my religious creed may be, and perhaps I do not exactly know it my- 
self, it is pleasure to reflect that my conduct has not brought, and is 
not likely to bring, discredit to my friends. Wherever I have been, it 
has been my good fortune to meet with or to make ardent and affec- 
tionate friends. 1 feel persuaded I should have met with the same lot 
in Virginia had it been my chance to have settled there, as I had hoped 
and expected, for I think my course of conduct is sufficiently habitual 
to count on its effects.’” 
“I do sincerely lament,” continues Jefferson, “that untoward circum- 
stances have brought on us the irreparable loss of this professor, whom 
I have looked to as the corner-stone of our edifice. I know no sne who 
could have aided us so much in forming the future regulations for our 
infant institution; and although we may perhaps obtain from Europe 
equivalents in science, they can never replace the advantages of his ex-

perience, his knowledge of the character, habits, and manners of our 
country, his identification with its sentiments and principles, and high 
reputation he has obtained in it generally.” 
DR. COOPER GOES TO SOUTH CAROLINA. 
Jefferson’s good-will followed Dr. Cooper to his new professorship in 
South Carolina College, at Columbia, whither, in 1820, Jefferson sent 
his grandson, Eppes, and another young Virginian for collegiate educa- 
tion, the University of Virginia being not yet open to students. Jeffer- 
son wrote to Cooper that the institution at Columbia was now “of im- 
mediate interest to me,” and that he had proposed to send his grandson 
“to Columbia, rather than anywhere northwardly.”. At Columbia, 
S. C., Cooper taught natural science, politics, and economics. He be- 
came an exponent of free-trade doctrines, and was the academic repre- 
sentative and supporter of the economic views of Calhoun. He was one 
of tne greatest and most influential teachers in the entire South. Dr. 
Cooper, at Columbia, and Professor Dew, at William and Mary College, 
were the scientific advocates of the two leading ideas in Southern poli- 
tics. Cooper attacked the tariff, or protection. Dew defended slavery. 
A study of the writings of these two men will show the influences which 
shaped the political opinions of Southern statesmen. The laws of South 
Carolina were edited by Dr. Couper, and his influence upon legislation 
in that State resembles that of Jefferson in Virginia. He was a bold 
and aggressive character, with warm friends and bitter enemies. He 
provoked considerable opposition by reason of his outspoken religious 
views, which were not altogether in harmony with those of the society 
in which he lived. The man walked rough-shod over other men’s opin- 
ions, and suffered the inevitable consequences. His relation to his as- 
sociates in South Carolina College is described at length, and with some 
feeling, in LaBorde’s history of that institution, where he was succeeded 
in 1835 by Francis Lieber. 
JEFFERSON ON THE QUALIFICATIONS OF PROFESSORS. 
With regard to the qualifications of professors, Jefferson was from 
the first determined to have the best. His acquaintance with European 
men of learning and distinction, his correspondence with the faculty of 
Geneva, and with distinguished men like Dr. Priestley, Dr. Cooper, and 
M. Dupont de Nemours, had inspired him with a high ideal of professo- 
rial excellence. Upon this scientific foundation he proposed that the 
University of Virginia should be erected. He wrote to Cabell upon this 
point, February 23, 1824: ““You know that we have all, from the begin- 
ning, considered the high qualifications of our professors as the only 
means by which we could give to our institution splendor and pre- 
eminence over all its sister seminaries. The only question, therefore, 
we can ever ask ourselves, as to any candidate, will be, is he the most 
highly qualified? The college of Philadelphia has lost its character of

    110 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
primacy by indulging motives of favoritism and nepotism, and by con- 
ferring the appointments as if the professorships were entrusted to them 
as provisions for their friends. And even that of Edinburgh, you know, 
is also much lowered from the same cause. We are next to observe that 
aman is not qualified for a professor, knowing nothing but merely his 
own profession, He should be otherwise well educated as to the sci- 
ences generally; able to converse understandingly with the scientific 
men with whom he is associated, and to assist iv the councils of the fac- 
ulty on any subject of science on which they may have occasion to delib- 
erate. Without this, he will incur their contempt and bring disreputa- 
tion on the institution.” 
IDEA OF EUROPEAN PROFESSORS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
There was at least one substantial result of Jefferson’s correspond- 
ence upon university matters with men like Cooper, Pictet, Dupont de 
Nemours, Destutt Tracy, and other men of European training or celeb- 
rity. He determined to secure a faculty of distinguished men, who 
should represent the best science and academical experience of the old 
world. Thomas Cooper, the Englishman, educated at Oxford and rep- 
resenting natural science and historical jurisprudence, was practically 
Jefferson’s first choice as early as 1817, That same year he was en- 
deavoring to persuade Jean Baptiste Say to come to the neighborhood 
of Charlottesville. The following year correspondence with Cabell in- 
dicates that the latter was the first special agent selected by Jefferson 
to go to EBurope and engage professors for Central College. As we 
haye seen, Cabell had himself studied at European universities, and it 
was his European culture which first attracted the friendly notice of 
Jefferson, and made Cabeli the representative of the university idea in 
the Virginia Legislature. Personal and political interests compelled 
Cabell to remain in this country, and Francis W. Gilmer,! “a learned   
1 Francis W. Gilmer had early been interested in the subject of higher education, 
and at one time had seriously thought of becoming a professor in William and Mary 
College, but was dissuaded by the advice of Mr. Jefferson. The following letter is 
not without interest as illustrating Gilmer’s relations with the founder of the Univer- 
sity of Virginia: 
“MONTICELLO, April 10, 1818, 
“Dear Sir: I thank you for the letter of Mr. Ticknor, which I have thought myself 
justified in communicating to his friends here ou account of the pleasure it would 
give them, and that, I am sure, will give you pleasure. I trust you did not fora 
moment seriously think of shutting yourself behind the door of William and Mary 
College. A more complete cul de sac could not be proposed to you. No, dearsir, you 
are intended to do good to our country, and you musf get into the Legislature, for 
never did it more need the aid of all its talents, nor more peculiarly need them than 
at the next session. For although the prospect of our University is so far good, yet 
all is to go again to the Legislature, and who can tell who they will be, and what 
they will do? The visitors of our college meet next on the 11th of May ; Correa and 
Cooper willthen probably be here. Make you the third, and be assured of the pleasure 
it will give to them and to

and trustworthy citizen,” who had supported the University by his pen, 
was sent abroad by Jefferson upon the professorial errand. 
We can follow Gilmer in Jefferson’s correspondence with friends in 
England, Richard Rush and Maj. John Cartwright. A letter to the 
first of these scholars is so interesting and instructive as to Jefferson’s 
ideas of university appointments—the crucial test of all academic ad- 
ministration—that the text is given in full: 
JEFFERSON'S LETTER TO RICHARD RUSH. 
“ MONTICELLO, April 26, 1824. 
“DEAR Sir: I have heretofore informed you that our Legislature had 
undertaken the establishment of an University in Virginia; that it was 
placed in my neighborhood, and under the direction of a board of seven 
visitors, of whom I am one, Mr. Madison another, and others equally 
worthy of confidence. We have been four or five years engaged in erect 
ing our buildings, all of which are now ready to receive their tenants, one 
excepted, which the present season will put into a state for use. The 
last session of our Legislature had by new donations liberated the rey- 
enue of $15,000 a year, with which they had before endowed the insti- 
tution, and we propose to open it the beginning of the next year. We 
require the intervening time for seeking out and engaging professors. 
As to these, we have determined to receive no one who is not of the first 
order of science in his line, and as such in every branch can not be ob- 
tained with us, we propose to seek some of them at least in the countries 
ahead of us in science, and preferably in Great Britain, the land of our 
own language, habits, and manners. But how to find out those who are 
of the first grade of science, of sober, correct habits and morals, harmo- 
nizing tempers, talents for communication, isthe difficulty. Our first 
step is to send a specialagent to the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, 
and Edinburgh, to make the selection for us, and the person appointed 
for this office is the gentieman who will hand you this letter, Mr. Francis 
Walker Gilmer, the best-educated subject we have raised since the Rey- 
olution, highly qualified in all the important branches of science, profess- 
ing particularly that of the law, which he has practised some years at our 
Supreme Court with good success and flattering prospects. His morals, 
his amiable temper, and discretion will do justice to any confidence you 
may be willing to place in him, for I commit him to you as his mentor and 
enide in the business he goes on. We do not certainly expect to obtain 
such known characters as were the Cullens, the Robertsons, and Porsons, 
of Great Britain, men of the first eminence, established there in reputa- 
tion and office, and with emoluments not to be bettered anywhere. But 
we know that there is another race treading on their heels, preparing to 
take their places, and as well, and sometimes better, qualified to fill © 
them. These, while unsettled, surrounded by a crowd of competitors 
of equal claims and perhaps superior credit and interest, may prefer a 
comfortable certainty here for an uncertain hope there, and a lingering

delay even of that. From this description we expect we may draw profess- 
ors equal to those of the highest name. The difficulty is to distinguish 
them; for we are told that so overcharged are all branches of business 
in that country, and such the difficulty uf getting the means of living, 
that it is deemed allowable in ethics for even the most honorable minds 
to give highly exaggerated recommendations and certificates to enable 
a friend or protégé to get into a livelihood, and that the moment our agent 
should be known to be on such a mission he would be overwhelmed by 
applications from numerous pretenders, all of whom, worthy or unwor- 
thy, would be supported by such recommendations and such names as 
would confound all discrimination. On this head our trust and hopeis 
inyou. Your knowledge of the state of things, your means of finding 
out a character or two at each place truly trustworthy and into whose 
hands you can commit our agent with entire safety for information, 
caution, and co-operation, induces me to request your patronage and 
aid in our endeavors to obtain such men, and such only, as will fulfil our 
views. An unlucky selection in the outset would forever blast our 
prospects. From our information of the character of the different uni- 
versities, we expect we should go to Oxford for our classical professors, to 
Cambridge for those of mathematics, natural philosophy, and natural 
history, and to Edinburgh for a professor of anatomy, and the ele 
ments or outlines only of medicine. We have still our eye on Mr. Blaet- 
terman for the professorship of modern languages, and Mr. Gilmer is 
instructed to engage him if no very material objection to him may have 
arisen unknown to us. We can placein Mr. Gilmer’s hands but a moder- 
ate sum at present for merely text-books to begin with, and for indis- 
pensable articles of apparatus, mathematical, astronomical, physical, 
chemical, and anatomical. We are in the hope of a sum of $50,000 as 
soon as we can get a settlement passed through the public offices.' My 
experience in dealing with the bookseller Lackington, on your recom- 
mendation, has induced me to recommend him to Mr. Gilmer, and if we 
can engage his fidelity, we may put into his hands the larger supply of 
books when we are ready to call for it, and particularly what we shall 
propose to seek in England. 
“Although I have troubled you with many particulars, I yet leave 
abundance for verbal explanation with Mr. Gilmer, who possesses a full 
knowledge of everything, and our full confidence in everything. He   
1 Jefferson hoped to get-this extra sum of $50,000 from Congress in payment of the 
interest on the debt to the State of Virginia for expenditures during the war of 1512. 
The principal of the debt had been for the most part paid, but this was a claim for 
interest paid by the State of Virginia to the local banks which advanced the money. 
The whole matter is explained in a letter from Cabell to James Monroe, ‘then Presi- 
dent of the United States, April 2, 1824. (See Correspondence of Jefferson and Cabell, 
pp. 488-499.) About that time the Legislature of Virginia “appropriated, for the pur- 
pose of procuring the requisite library and apparatus for the University of the State, 
the sum of $50,000, to be paid out of the first moneys which might be received from 
the General Government in further discharge of the debt still due to the Common- 
wealth.” (Compare also Jetferson’s letter to Cabell, January 11, 1825.)

takes with him plans of our establishment, which we think it may be 
encouraging to show to the persons to whom he will make propositions, 
as well to let them see the comforts provided for themselves as to show, 
by the extensiveness and expense of the scale, that it is no ephemeral 
thing to which they are invited. 
“ With my earnest solicitations that you will give us all your aid in 
an undertaking ou which we rest the hopes and happiness of our coun- 
try, accept the assurances of my sincere friendship, attachment, and 
respect.” 
LETTER TO MAJOR JOHN CARTWRIGHT. 
The following extract is from a letter to Maj. John Cartwright, June 
5, 1824, in acknowledgment of his work on the English Constitution, 
deducing ‘ the English nation from its rightful root, the Anglo-Saxon.” 
After a most remarkable tribute to early English institutions, Jeffer- 
son adverts to the University of Virginia and Gilmer’s professorial mis- 
sion. He expresses his “acknowledgments for your good wishes to 
the University we are now establishing in this State. There are some 
novelties in it. Of that of a professorship of the principles of govern- 
ment, you express your approbation. They will be founded in the rights 
of man. That of agriculture, I am sure, you will approve; and that 
also of Anglo-Saxon. As the histories and laws left us in that type 
and dialect must be the text-books of the reading of the learners, they 
will imbibe with the language their free principles of government. The 
volumes you have been so kind as to send, shall be placed in the library 
of the University, Having at this time in England a person sent for 
the purpose of selecting some professors, a Mr. Gilmer of my neighbor- 
hood, I can not but recommend him to your patronage, counsel, and 
guardianship against imposition, misinformation, and the deceptions of 
partial and false recommendations in the selection of characters. He is 
a gentleman of great worth and correctness, my particular friend, well 
educated in various branches of science, and worthy of entire confidence. 
“Your age of eighty-four and mine of eighty-one years, insure us a 
speedy meeting. We may then commune at leisure, and more fally, on 
the good and evil which, in the course of our long lives, we have both 
witnessed ; and in the mean time, I pray you to accept assurances of my 
high veneration and esteem for your person and character.” 
This letter from the Sage of Monticello, looking backward with his- 
toric appreciation to the Saxon sources of the great modern stream of 
liberty and self-government then flowing through Virginia, and looking 
forward with perfect calm to higher ranges of philosophic contempla- 
tion, is one of the most noteworthy in Jefferson’s later correspond- 
ence, rich as it all is in suggestive thought. To see him turning to a 
sage of the old world for counsel and guidance in the manning of “ our 
University, the last of my mortal cares, and the last service I can ren- 
der my country,”! is a nobler spectacle than the Homeric picture of

old men conversing together upon the walls of Troy; and yet it is but 
one of ten thousand subjects for the poet of modern democracy. 
GERMAN AND ENGLISH PROFESSORS. 
Agreeably to the wishes of Jefferson, the first faculty of the Univer- 
sity of Virginia was largely selected from younger professorial talent in 
England. His practical reasons for preferring English to Continental 
sources of supply are highly creditable to Jefferson’s good judgment. 
At one time he had thought of importing bodily into this country a 
French faculty from the College of Geneva. Although no Anglo-ma 
niac, Jefferson recognized that kinship of ideas, English antecedents, 
habits, and manners, and, above all, a good knowledge of the English 
language were important considerations. For German and Romance, of 
course, German and French professors were requisite. As intimated 
in Jefferson’s letter to Richard Rush, Mr. Blaettermann had been recom: 
mended for the modern languages, and he was promptly engaged. He 
was an accomplished Anglo-Saxon scholar, and served the University 
for fifteen years, from 1825 until 1840, when he was dismissed.! 
One of the finest representatives of English scholarship secured by 
Mr. Gilmer? was Mr. George Long (1800-1879), a graduate of the Uni- 
1 The Southern Literary Messenger for January, 1842, in a well-meant article upon 
the University of Virginia, has some unfavorable comments upon Dr. Blaettermann, 
who was perhaps too familiar with the manners of ‘‘ Die alten Deutschen.” 
2 After the present monograph was completed, the writer obtained possession of a 
large mass of original correspondence relating to the beginnings of the University of 
Virginia. Among the letters were those addressed by Francis W. Gilmer to George 
Long and other English scholars, and their replies. The correspondence is too exten- 
sive for reproduction here, and it has been intrusted to a graduate student at the 
Johns Hopkins University, Mr. William P. Trent, of Richmond, who will prepare a 
fresh contribution to the early history of the University of Virginia, with copious 
extracts from the Gilmer letters. A brief account of this new material may befound 
in the writer’s bibliography of authorities relating to the subject of the present mono 
graph. The following specimen letters are introduced in this connection as a fore 
taste of what is to come.   
Francis W. Gilmer to George Long (London, August 21, 1824). 
“T am sure the nature of this letter will be a sufficient excuse to Mr. L. for his re- 
ceiving such a one from a perfect stranger. 
“The State of Virginia has for six years been engaged in establishing a university 
on a splendid scheme. The homes are now finished, an avenue for the support of the 
professors, etc., appropriated, and I have come to England to engage professors in 
some of the branches in which Europe is still before us. I have heard your quali- 
fications as professor of Latin and Greek highly commended, and wish to know 
whether such an appointment would be agreeable to you. . My powers are absolute, 
and whatever engagement you make with me is binding om the University without 
further ratification. 
“You will have (1) a commodious house, garden, ete., for a family residence, en- 
tirely to yourself, free of rent ; (2) asalary of $1,500 per annum paid by the University, 
and tuition fees from $50 to $25 from each pupil, according to the number of profes- 
sors he attends; (3) your tenure of officeis sucb at you can be removed only by the

versity of Oxford. He was an excellent type of Oxford classical cult- 
ure and became the founder of the school of ancient languages, for 
the cultivation of which the University of Virginia has remained dis- 
tinguished, from the three years’ service of Long (1825-1828) and the 
  
concurrence of five out of seven, all the first men in our country, with Mr. Jefferson 
at the head. 
‘Mr. Key suggested that your being obliged to be in Cambridge next July might be 
‘an obstacle. That may be removed by a stipulation that in that year, 1825, you shall 
have liberty to come to England, for which reasonable time shall be allowed, so as to 
make your visit to Cambridge certain. 
“You will be required not to teach a mere grammar school, but to instruct young 
men somewhat advanced in reading the Latin and Greek classics. Hebrew is also 
included, but there will not be occasion for it, I think, and you could easily learn 
enough for what may be required. You should explain the history and geography of 
the famous ancient nations as illustrative of,their liberation. 
“The whole is now only waiting formy action to go into full and active operation. 
You will see, therefore, the necessity of making an early decision. I should like the 
professors to sail October or November, and shall thank you for an intimation of your 
wishes on the subject as soon as convenient.

“Dear Sir: I am sorry to learn that you still continue so weak from the effects 
of your illness. I anticipated the pleasure of seeing you in this neighborhood during - 
Christmas; your presence would have contributed to enliven the University up, which,

“T have been settled for some weeks in one of the pavilions. I bought only a few 
articles in Charlottesville, as I found the prices of most things extravagantly high.

safety, but I regret, both for the University and my own personal comfort, that they 
were so foolish as to embark in an old log. The people in Charlottesville, having 
nothing better to do, amuse themselves with inventing stories on this unfortunate 
subject. Almost every day, from undoubted authority, I am informed the professors 
have arrived; a few hours after I had received your letter a man very gravely assured 
me the professors were at that moment in Richmond. 
‘The books have arrived in safety; we have not been able to find a catalogue of 
them, and I believe we shall not take them out of the boxes before Mr. Jefferson 
receives one from you. I brought a sufficient number to employ myself on during 
this most anxious expectation of our friends’ arrival. Besides the loss of their society 
at present, Iam truly concerned for the interests of the University. I hear daily 
of many who are most eagerly looking forward to the opening of the institution ; it 
is possible their short delay at first may cause the University some temporary loss.

longer term of Gessner Harrison down to the régimes of Gildersleeve 
(1856-1876), Price, and Wheeler in Greek, and Peters in Latin (since 
1865). GEORGE LONG. 
Professor Long was the first of those engaged to arrive upon the 
University premises, and he seems to have made a favorable impression 
upon Jefferson. The latter wrote to Cabell, December 22, 1824: “Mr. 
Long, professor of ancient languages, is located in his apartments at 
the University. He drew, by lot, Pavilion No.5, He appears to: be 
a most amiable man, of fine understanding, well qualified for his de- 
partment, and acquiring esteem as fast as he becomes known. Indeed, 
Ihave great hopes that the whole selection will fulfil our wishes.” 
Professor Loug more than met the expectations of the friends of the 
University during the few years that he tarried in Virginia, although 
the English don must have surprised the authorities by marrying a 
Virginia widow. Jefferson had imagined that his professors would re- 
main single and live up stairs in the pavilions, leaving the ground floor 
for recitation-rooms; but professors’ wives soon changed all that, and 
the classes were driven out-doors. 
Mr. Long gave a character and a standard to the classical department 
which it has never lost. He represented history in connection with 
the classics; and certainly ancient history never had a more scholarly 
representative upon American shores. Unfortunately for this country, 
but to the great gain of historical science in his own land, Mr. Long 
was called home in 1828, to a professorship of Greek in the new Univer- 
sity of London. Madison, ina letter to Monroe, dated January 23, 1828, 
says, “I have received a letter from Mr. Brougham urging our release 
of Professor Long.”! The university authorities in Virginia parted 
most reluctantly with Mr. Long, but recognized the superior attractive- 
ness and advantages of his call to the English capital. They urged, 
however, most strongly that the professor should find a suitable suc- 
cessor. On the 10th of March, 1829, Madison wrote to Joseph ©. Cabell: 
“JT have just received from our minister in London and from Professor 
Long letters on the subject of a successor to the latter. Mr. B. is do- 
ing all he can for us, but without any encouraging prospects. Mr. 
Long is pretty decided that we ought not to rely on any successor from 
England, and is equally so that Dr. Harrison will answer our purpose 
better than any one attainable abroad. He appears to be quite sanguine 
upon this point.”* Dr, Harrison was one of Mr. Long’s own pupils, 
and one of the first graduates of the University of Virginia. No more 
fitting nomination or appointment, nor one better deserved, could pos- 
sibly have been made. 
It would be interesting to follow in detail the brilliant record of Pro- 
fessor Long after his return to England, if space permitted. He and his 
former colleague at the University, Mr. Key, who was made professor

of Latin in the London University, introduced into England the com- 
parative method in classical study. Long edited a great variety of class- 
ical texts, some of which remain standard to this day. The Encyclope- 
dia Britannica, in a striking article upon this remarkable scholar, says: 
“ Long has exercised by his writings, and indirectly through some of 
his London University pupils, a wide influence on the teaching of the 
Greek and Latin languages in England.” He was prominent in found- 
ing the Royal Geographical Society, and became a leading authority in 
both ancient and modern geography. Long’s Classical Atlas is known 
to school boys in both England and America. One can not help suspect- 
ing that Long’s knowledge of this country had something to do with 
the inception of his Geography of America and the West Indies. He 
became a thorough democrat in education, resigning his professorship 
to edit the Quarterly Journal of Education, published by the Society for 
the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, of which he was for years a most 
active member. Thirteen years of his life he devoted to the Penny Cy- 
clopxdia, of which he edited twenty-nine volumes. This was his great- 
est work for the education of the English people. He returned to aca- 
demic life, and wrote his great work on Roman history. He was the 
chief English authority upon Roman law and was one of the academic 
pioneers in this study, although he was anticipated by Dr. Thomas 
Cooper, who, in Pennsylvania, edited parts of the Code of Justinian long 
before his call to represent law in the University of Virginia. That in- 
stitution may well be proud of the scholarly Englishman first chosen 
by Jefferson to represent sound learning within its walls. 
THOMAS HEWETT KEY AND CHARLES BONNYCASTLE. 
Another well-trained university man from England, who was secured 
for Jefferson’s institution, was Thomas Hewett Key. He afterward went 
with Long to the University of London and became its first professor 
of Latin. He founded in Virginia that wonderful school of mathe- 
matics for which the institution has always remained famous. He was 
succeeded by Charles Bonnycastle, a third Englishman who came over 
with Key and founded a school of physics. Bonnyc&stle remained at the 
University of Virginia until his death, in 1840,’ when he was succeeded   
1The Southern Literary Messenger for January, 1842, speaking of the recent loss of 
three university professors, says of Professor Bonnycastle: ‘‘Mr. Bonnycastle was one 
of the early professors who came over from England with Mr. Gilmer in 1824. Though 
young, his high qualifications fitted him alike for several of the chairsin the University. 
He first filled that of natural philosophy, and, on the return of Mr. Key to England, 
succeeded to the wathematical, which he filled with pre-eminent ability up to the time 
of his death. He was always acknowledged to be the possessor of a great mind, which 
readily made him master of the most abstruse learning. The study of mathematics 
seemed to be to him but a process of attentive reading. As a lecturer he was clear, 
patient, and powerful; and in matters of science he was a complete agrarian, level- 
ling its difficulties to the comprehension of every mind. At times, in one short apho- 
rism, he would display a profundity of thought quite startling; and his students de- 
_ clared that, by way of illustration,he frequently solved difficulties which had perplexed

by Prof. J. J. Sylvester, who afterward returned to England, but who, 
in 1876, came out to America again, and founded a flourishing de- 
partment of mathematics at the Johns Hopkins University. In 1884 
he was called home to the chair of mathematics in Oxford. Among 
the American successors of this distinguished line of English mathe- 
maticians was Albert T. Bledsoe, famous after the civil war as the editor 
of the Southern Review, published in Baltimore. The present able 
representative of the mathematical department at the University of Vir- 
ginia is Professor Charles S. Venable, now the chairman of the faculty, to 
whose courtesy the writer is greatly indebted for prompt and efficient co- 
operation in acquiring material information for this educational report. 
ROBLEY DUNGLISON. 
Robley Dunglison was the fourth Englishman originally appointed 
professor at the University of Virginia. He was the founder of the 
medical school, and became a distinguished contributor to medical sci- 
ence. His published works are still spoken of with great respect. He 
was Jefferson’s favorite physician, and attended him in his last illness. 
_ It is to Dunglison’s journal and reminiscences of Jefferson that we owe 
the most pleasing glimpses into Jefferson’s friendly social relations with 
the professors of the University. 
Jefferson was highly gratified with the choice of these European schol- 
ars as instructors. In a letter to William B. Giles, December 26, 1825, 
he said: “Our University has been most fortunate in the five professors 
procured from England. A finer selection could not have been made. 
Besides their being of a grade of science which has left little superior 
behind, the correctness of their moral character, their acecommodat- 
ing dispositions, and zeal for the prosperity of the institution leave us 
nothing more to wish. I verily believe that as high a degree of educa- 
tion can now be obtained here as in the country they left.” Cabell also 
was delighted with the strength and promise of the new faculty. He 
wrote to Jefferson: “I cannot describe the satisfaction which I feel in 
reflecting on the present prospects of the University. Our corps of pro- 
fessors is full of youth and talent and energy. What will not such men 
accomplish with such advantages ?”   
them in other branches of their studies. Mathematics was rendered by him what he 
repeatedly said it was, ‘a pure system of logic.’ Many parts of his course were sup- 
plied by himself, and he wrote a text-book for his class, which gained him great re- 
nown. * * * Insociety and at home he was often taciturn, and it was only at cer. 
tain times that he opened his stores of information; but when he did, he never failed 
to charm and surprise. * * * I donot know that he ever became a citizen of the 
United States, though he frequently spoke of his intention todoso. He thought very 
favorably of our country and her institutions. Mr. Bonnycastle was a close student, 
and perhaps his devotion to study led to a premature death. He took very little ex- 
ercise, studied in an unhealthy posture and until a late hour of the night.” This 
glimpse of Bonnycastle, evidently by one of his former students, reveals the mathe- 
matical professor.

PROFESSORS OF ETHICS AND LAW. 119 
AMERICAN PROFESSORS. 
There were two professorships which, for practical reasons, Jefferson 
was determined to have filled by native Americans. These chairs 
were (1) ethics and (2) law and politics. He had the conviction that 
American youth should be trained to a knowledge of their duties, laws. 
and system of government by American teachers. The above subjects 
were as sacred in the mind of Jefferson as is the Protestant or Catholic 
religion to its respective adherents, who wish their own teachers for 
their own faith. 
GEORGE TUCKER AND JOHN TAYLOE LOMAX. 
For the chair of ethics or moral science, Hon. George Tucker, a mem- 
ber of Congress from Virginia, was chosen, and he served the University 
ably and well for twenty years, 1825-45. Greater difficulty was ex- 
perienced in filling the chair of law and politics. The first choice, after 
Dr. Cooper, was Francis Walker Gilmer, who had selected the English 
professors with such excellent judgment, but he declined the honor 
which was thrice urged upon ‘him. The position was then offered in 
succession to Chancellor Tucker, Mr. Barbour, Judge Carr, and Judge 
Dade; but, for professional and other reasons, all were unwilling to ac- 
cept the professorial office. It was then tendered to the Attorney-Gen- 
eral. of the United States, the Hon. William Wirt, together with the ° 
presidency of the University, an additional honor specially created in 
order to induce Mr. Wirt to take the chair of law and politics. Jefferson 
heartily approved of the choice of Mr. Wirt as professor, but he entered 
with his own hand upon the records, at the last meeting of the board of 
visitors which he ever attended, a vigorous protest against the office 
of a permanent president, as being inconsistent with republican ideas. 
After Mr. Wirt’s declination, the “ presidency ” was never revived. The 
executive headship is annually committed to an appointed “ chairman of 
the faculty,” a democratic office corresponding to the pro-rectorship of 
a German university. The professorship of law and politics was finally 
accepted by Mr. Gilmer, but he died in 1826. John Tayloe Lomax, of 
Fredericksburg, was appointed.in the spring of 1826, and he held the 
office with distinction for four years. He was not only-an able pro- 
fessor, but he contributed substantially to the development of jurispru- 
dence in Virginia. He published a digest of Virginia law and various 
useful texts. The Jaw school which Lomax founded has had other able 
representatives, but none more able or more widely known for his learn- 
ing and power as a teacher than Professor John B. Minor, who has been 
the head of the school for many years, and whose pupils! are conspicu- 
ous wherever they go.   
1Qne of the most successful and distinguished of Mr. Minor’s pupils is Woodrow 
Wilson, author of Congressional Government, sometime professor of history and poli- 
tics in Bryn Mawr College, now of Wesleyan University, and lecturer on Administra- 
tion at the Johns Hopkins University, where he took his doctor’s degree in the year 
1886.

120, JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
JOHN P. EMMET. 
In addition to Tucker and Lomax, Dr. John P. Emmet should be 
counted among the original American professors. Although born in 
Treland, he was educated in this country, chiefly at West Point and in 
New York City. He is the nearest approach to a “literary character 
of the Irish nation,” such as Jefferson wished in 1783 to introduce into 
Albemarle County. But the young Irish-American, a nephew of Robert 
Emmet, the great orator, was engaged to teach chemistry and natural 
history, in which subjects he had been well trained in connection with 
medical and other scientific studies. Jefferson regarded Dr. Emmet as 
- a representative cf the natural sciences. 
  THE UNIVERSITY OPENED TO STUDENTS. 
  The University of Virginia was opened to students on the 7th of 
March, 1825. Jefferson, in his seventh annual report to the president 
and directors of the literary fund, dated October 7, 1825, said there were 
forty students present at the beginning; ‘others continued to arrive 
from day to day at first, and from week to week since; and the whole 
number matriculated on the last day of September was 116. Few more 
can be expected during the present term, which closes on the 15th of 
December next; and the state of the schools on the same day was as 
follows : 
“Tn the school of— Scholars.

   Modern language - 64 
Mathematics ..-... 268 
Natural philosophy - 33 
Natural, history. . ee OU) 
Anatomy and medicine a 20) 
Moral philosophy .-.--.-...-. vores 
Jefferson said the dormitories would accommodate about 218 students, 
and the neighboring town of Charlottesville perhaps 50 more. Seven 
of the schools were organized and in successful operation in the course 
of the year 1825. There was some delay in securing a professor of law, 
as we have already seen. The original number of professors recommended 
in Jefferson’s report to the Legislature in 1818 was ten; but motives of 
economy compelled a reduction to eight. 
Jefferson showed the mostactive interest in shaping and expanding the 
course of study. There are two interesting letters to Professor Emmet 
in Jefferson’s Correspondence, dated, respectively, April 27 and May 2, 
1826, concerning the importance of introducing botany into university 
instruction, and indicating Jefferson’s views! with regard to the develop-

ical Science. Pronounced by reqaest before the New York Lyceum of Natural His- -

mentand co-ordination of the various branches of scientific study. Jet: 
ferson proposed the establishment of a botanical garden and a seminary 
for forestry upen the university premises. He communicated to Em- 
met a detailed plan, prepared by the Abbé Correa, a distinguished 
European botanist, one of Jefferson’s old friends, who had served Port- 
ugal as foreign minister at Washington. “Our institution being then 
on hand,” writes Jefferson, ‘in which that was of course to be one of the 
subjects of instruction, I availed myself of his presence and friendship 
to obtain from him a general idea of the extent of ground we should 
employ, and the number and character of the plants we should intro- 
duce into it. He accordingly sketched for me a mere outline of the 
scale he would recommend, restrained altogether to objects of use, and 
indulging not at all in things of mere curiosity, and especially not yet 
thinking of a hot-house, or even of a green-house.” 
JEFFERSON'S CONNECTION WITH THE JARDIN DES PLANTES. 
Jefferson was extremely practical in some of his scientific projects, 
and especially in the pursuit of botany. He wished to introduce plants 
and trees that would be useful to his countrymen. “For three-and- 
twenty years of the last twenty-five, my good old friend Thonin, super- 
intendent of the Garden of Plants at Paris, has regularly sent mea box 
of seeds, of such exotics, as to us, a8 would suit our climate, and con- 
taining nothing indigenous to our country. These I regularly sent to 
the public and private gardens of the other States, having as yet no 
employment for them here.” 
This letter was written only about two months before Jefferson’s 
death. Maintaining for nearly a quarter of a century his connections 
with Paris, the original source of Jefferson’s enlarged ideas of uni- 
versity education, he had been scattering seeds from the Jardin des 
Plantes over the public and private gardens of America. Could there 
be a more pleasing historic picture of that dissemination of educa- 
tional ideas which has now gone on for more than two generations 
from the University of Virginia, that seminary of higher learning, 
founded by the Sage of Monticello? Broadcast over the entire South 
have been scattered the seeds of culture and the germs of science. 
Some have fallen by the wayside; some where there was not much 
earth; but some have fallen upon good ground. Little is known at the 
North concerning the University of Virginia, but it is barely possible 
that some seeds of Jeffersonian influence have been wafted by the winds 
of destiny into the very gardens of New England culture.

CHAPTER IX. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND HARVARD COLLEGE. 
GEORGE TICKNOR VISITS JEFFERSON, 1815. 
It is not beyond the range of possibility that the advanced ideas 
of Thomas Jefferson had some quickening influence upon educational 
reform at Harvard College. When only twenty-three years old George 
Ticknor, of Boston, on a Southern tour, visited Jefferson at Monticello. 
One of the most charming glimpses of social life in that hospitable man- 
sion, in its best estate, may be found in Ticknor’s letter home. In his 
interesting Life, Letters, and Journals, it is said that Mr. Jefferson 
“formed quite an affection for the young Federalist from New England.” 
A pleasant correspondence sprang up between the old Virginian and the 
young Bostonian, who went abroad’ after conscientiously travelling 
through historic portions of his own country. 
CORRESPONDENCE WITH TICKNOR. 
As early as 1817 Jefferson communicated to Ticknor, while the latter 
was yet abroad, the entire plan for the advancement of education in 
Virginia. In'1818 Jefferson wrote to Ticknor: “You will come home 
fraught with great means of promoting the science, and consequently 
1In a letter to M. Dupont de Nemours, dated February 15, 1800, Jefferson thus rec- 
ommends young Ticknor: ‘This letter will be delivered to you by Mr. Ticknor, a 
young gentleman from Massachusetts, of much erudition and great merit. He has 
completed his course of law reading, and before entering on the practice, proposes to 
pass two or three yearsin seeing Europe, and adding to his store of knowledge what 
he can acquire there. Should he enter the career of politics in his own country, he 
will go far in obtaining its honors and powers. He is worthy of any friendly offices 
you may be so good as to render him, and to his acknowledgments of them will be 
added my own. By himI send you a copy of the Review of Montesquieu, from my 
own shelf, the impression being, I believe, exhausted by the late president of the Col- 
lege of Williamsburg having adopted it as the elementary book there. I am persuad- 
ing the author to permit the original to be printed in Paris. Although your presses, I 
observe, are put under the leading strings of your Government, yet this is such a 
work as would have been licensed at any period, early or late, of the reign of Louis 
XVI. Surely the present Government will not expect'to repress the progress of the 
public mind further back than that. Tu. Jerrerson.”—Maupin MS. Collection.

the happiness of your country.” Jefferson then describes the progress 
of his plans, and suggests that Ticknor take the professorship of ethics, 
belles-lettres, and the fine arts. ‘TI have some belief,” he continues, 
“that our genial climate would be more friendly to your constitution 
than the rigors of that of Massachusetts; but all this may yield, pos- 
sibly, to the hoc celum, sub quo natus educatusque essem. I have in- 
dulged in this reverie the more credulously, because you say in your 
letter that ‘if there were a department in the central government that 
was devoted to public instruction, I might have sought a place in it; 
but there is none; there is none even in my State government.” Jeffer- 
son then attempts to convince Ticknor that there is no possible outlook 
for a bureau of education in Washington without an amendment to the 
Constitution, and that the University of Virginia will supersede the 
necessity for it. 
On the 3d of October, 1820, immediately after the arrangement with 
Dr. Cooper had been cancelled, and fully four years before any nego- 
tiations were opened with professors in England, the board of visitors 
of the University of Virginia, acting, as always, under Mr. Jefferson’s 
leadership, authorized the engagement of “ Mr. Bowditch,! of Salem, and 
Mr. Ticknor, of Boston,” as professors, with the promise of apartments, 
asalary of $2,000 per annum, and lecture-fees guaranteed to the amount 
of $500 extra. This was an extremely liberal offer for those times. 
Harvard College had already secured? Ticknor for the professorship of 
French, Spanish, and belles-lettres, at the moderate salary of $1,000, of 
which Ticknor afterwards regularly renounced $400 a year to aid the 
embarrassed finances of the institution. 
JEFFERSON ON THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM. 
Ticknor’s interest in the development of the University of Virginia 
was keen and pronounced. He continued his correspondence with Jef- 
ferson, and proposed a visit to the University as soon as it should be 
“fairly opened.” In acknowledging Ticknor’s Syllabus of Lectures on 
Spanish Literature, Jefferson said, June 16, 1823: “Iam not fully in- 
  
4 Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838) was originally a Salem sea-captain, who became 
eminent for his contributions to mathematics and to the American Academy of Arts 
and Sciences. He was deserved ly recognized by Harvard College, which gave him 
the degree of LL.D. President Quincy, in his History of Harvard (II, 438) says 
Bowditch “received successively the offer of three professorships of mathematics—in 
Harvard University, in that of Charlottesville in Virginia, and in the United States 
Military Academy at West Point—all which he declined.” Dr. Bowditch was a very 
modest and unassuming man. After retiring from sea-voyages he became president 
of the Salem Fire and Marine Insurance Company, and after 1823 was the Boston act- 
uary of the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company. His nearest approach 
to academic life was membership of the corporation of Harvard University. One of 
his many works was a commentary on the Mécanique Céleste of La Place, which he 
translated into English. 
2Ticknor was elected professor in June, 1816; he accepted in January, 1817, and 
entered upon his duties in 1819. (Quincy’s History of Harvard University, II, 324.)

formed of the practices at Harvard, but there is one from which we shall 
certainly vary, although it has been copied, I believe, by nearly every 
college and academy in the United States. That is, the holding the 
students all to one prescribed course of reading, and disallowing ex- 
clusive application to those branches only which are to qualify them for 
the particular vocations to which they are destined. We shall, on the 
contrary, allow them uncontrolled choice in the lectures they shall choose 
to attend, and require elementary qualification only and sufficient age. 
Our institution will proceed on the principle of doing all the good it can, 
without consulting its own pride or ambition ; of letting every one come 
and listen to whatever he thinks may improve the condition of his mind.” 
Jefferson then urges Ticknor not to defer his visit beyond the autumn 
of the ensuing year, when the last building would be nearly finished. 
“T know that you scout, as I do, the idea of any rivalship. Our views 
are catholic, for the improvement of our country by science, and, indeed, 
it is better even for your own university to have its yoke-mate at this 
distance rather than to force a nearer one from the increasing necessity 
for it.” 
_TICKNOR VISITS THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
In December, 1824, Ticknor visited Jefferson and the University of 
Virginia, and wrote a most charming description of both the man and 
the institution to William H. Prescott, the historian. The following 
sketch of the new foundation has an historic value: ‘Yesterday we 
formed a party, and, with Mr. Jefferson at our head, went to the Univer- 
sity. It is a very fine establishment, consisting of ten houses for pro- 
fessors, four eating-houses, a rotunda on the model of the Parthenon 
[Pantheon], with a magnificent room for a library, and four fine lecture- 
rooms, with one hundred and eigkt apartments for students; the whole 
situated in the midst of two hundred and fifty acres of land, high, 
healthy, and with noble prospects all around it. It has cost $250,000, 
and the thorough finish of every part of it and the beautiful architect- 
ure of the whole show, I think, that it has not cost too much. “Each 
professor receives his house, which in Charlottesville, the neighboring 
village, would rent for $600, a salary of $1,500, and a fee of $20 from 
every student who attends his instructions, which are to be lectures 
three times a week. Of the details of the system I shall discourse much 
when I see you. It is more practical than I feared, but not so practical 
that I feel satisfied of its success. It is, however, an experiment worth 
trying, to which I earnestly desire the happiest results; and they have, 
to begin it, a mass of buildings more beautiful than anything archi- 
tectural in New England, and more appropriate to an university than 
ean be found, perhaps, in the world.” 
TICKNOR’S EFFORTS FOR REFORM IN HARVARD COLLEGE. 
This is high praise from a Harvard professor, who had seen the best 
institutions of Europe. But the point to which this narrative is di-

TICKNOR’S REFORMS AT HARVARD. “AD 
rectly tending is this: George Ticknor was now beginning to introduce 
into Harvard College precisely those educational reforms which Jeffer- 
son had been advocating in Virginia for many years. Jefferson’s ad- 
vanced ideas were probably well known to Ticknor by reason of his long 
correspondence with Jefferson, and by reason of the early negotiations 
regarding a professorship in the University of Virginia. There is but 
one opinion as to the pioneer influence of Ticknor in the reform move- 
ment at Harvard College. The history of that movement is given in the 
Life, Letters, and Journals of George Ticknor, Vol. I, Chap. XVIII, 
on the “Efforts for Reform in Harvard College.” It is perfectly clear 
that 'Ticknor, through a letter to Hon. William Prescott, a member of 
the corporation, set on foot, in the year 1821, the first systematic in- 
quiries which led to important educational reforms. Ticknor’s views 
found absolutely no support from the faculty ; on the contrary, the pro- 
fessors voted repeatedly against his innovations. It was chiefly through 
Hon. William Prescott and Judge Story that Ticknor’s ideas found 
favor with the corporation and the board of overseers, who adopted 
them in June, 1825. At the request of Judge Story, Mr. Webster, and 
Mr. Prescott, Ticknor prepared an article for the North American Re- 
view explaining and vindicating the proposed changes. This article, 
although invited and accepted by the editor, was finally suppressed “by ~ 
the advice of friends.” It appeared, however, in pamphlet! form in 
September, 1825, and went through two editions that year. 
The changes ordered by the governing authorities encountered great 
opposition from the faculty. In the annual visitation by the overseers, 
in 1826, “‘the new arrangements were not found working successfully 
in any department but that of the modern languages.” The corpora- 
tion was forced to relax the binding force of its own legislation. In 
1827, the faculty resolved that the new law “should not be applied to 
the departments, or by individual instructors, without the assent of the 
faculty,” but “that if the department of modern languages choose to 
apply the law to the classes instructed by that department, the faculty 
assent.” It is therefore clear that George Ticknor, the head of that de- 
partment, was the acknowledged representative of a novel policy which 
is best described in the following extract from President Eliot’s annual 
report for 1883-84. Speaking of the new code of 1825, President Eliot 
says: 
THE NEW CODE OF 1825. 
“These laws provide, among other new things, for the admission to 
the university of persons not candidates for a degree (Statutes and Laws 
1 Remarks on Changes Lately Proposed or Adopted in Harvard University: By 
George Ticknor, Smith professor, ete. Boston: Cummings, Hilliard & Co. 1825. 
Speaking, on p. 40, of the desirability of an elective system, Ticknor said: ‘This, 
perhaps, is not yet possible with us, though it is actually doing in the University of 
Virginia ; and will soon, it is to be hoped, be considered indispensable in all our ad- 
vanced colleges.”

of the University of Cambridge, 1826, § 11); for the division of the in- 
struction into departments, with a professor at the head of each depart- 
ment responsible for its efficiency (§§ 58 and 60); for the division of 
classes according to proficiency (§ 61); and for the consideration, to a 
limited extent, of the desires of students in the arrangement of their 
studies (§ 63). These provisions originated in the overseers, and were 
adopted by the corporation and overseers against the judgment of the 
‘immediate government, or faculty, and obtained but very imperfect 
execution; but they gave to George Ticknor, Smith professor of the 
French and Spanish languages and literature, the means of demonstrat- 
ing, during the ensuing ten years, in the single department which he 
organized and controlled, the admirable working of a voluntary sys- 
tem.” 
TICKNOR’S RESIGNATION. 
In 1835, when Ticknor resigned his professorship, he reviewed his 
fifteen years’ work at Harvard in a letter from which the following sig- 
nificant passage is taken. He says: “Within the limits of the depart- 
ment I have entirely broken up the division of classes, established fully 
the principle and practice of progress according to proficiency, and in- 
-trodueed a system of voluntary study, which for several years has em- 
braced from one hundred and forty to one hundred and sixty students, 
so that we have relied hardly at all on college discipline, as it is called, 
but almost entirely on the good disposition of the young men and their 
desire to learn. If, therefore, the department of the modern languages 
is right, the rest of the college is wrong; and if the rest of the college 
is right we ought to adopt its system, which I believe no person what- 
soever has thought desirable for the last three or four years.” 
ORIGIN OF TICKNOR’S EDUCATIONAL IDEAS. . 
Now the question arises, where did George Ticknor get all these ad- 
vanced ideas of university education, upon which Harvard has been 
growing from more to more during two generations? Notin Cambridge,! 
surely, for Ticknor was a graduate of Dartmouth College and the Cam- 
bridge faculty bitterly opposed hisinnovations. Not from Mr. Prescott 
and the board of corporation, for he first inspired them with the policy 
which the faculty for a long time successfully obstructed. The college 
environment was not favorable to the evolution of educational theories 
utterly at variance with the scholastic experience of nearly two cen- 
  
1 Germs of an elective system appear to have existed at Harvard College as early as 
1824. Among the questions proposed to the immediate government of Harvard Col- 
‘lege by the committee of the board of visitors, October 16, 1824, was the following: 
“Question II. How far have the students a choice as to what studies they way pur- 
‘sue? 
“Answer II, The Juniors have an option between Hebrew and several other 
studies, viz, French, mathematics, Latin, and Greek; and the Seniors-between the 
recitations in chemistry and in fluxions.”

turies. It may be suggested that Ticknor came home from Goettingen 
and from European travel with a new educational philosophy which he 
was eager to put into practice. But he says: ‘ When I came from Eu- 
rope [1819], not having been educated at Cambridge, and having always 
looked upon it with great veneration, [had no misgivings about the wis- 
dom of the organization and management of the college there. I went 
about my work, therefore, with great alacrity and confidence; not, in- 
deed, according to a plan I proposed in writing, but according to the es- 
tablished order of things, which I was urged to adopt as my own, and 
which I did adopt very cheerfully.” 
Called the very next year, 1820, to a professorship in the University 
of Virginia, with more than double his salary at Cambridge, and in 
frequent correspondence with Jefferson after the year 1815, Ticknor 
had sufficient occasion and opportunity to become acquainted with Jef- 
ferson’s educational ideas. Ticknor was a Bostonian, always on the 
alert for new and suggestive things. That he was deeply interested in 
the new institution is shown by his visit in 1824, and by his letter to 
William H. Prescott, the son of the man who, from the first, was Tick- 
nor’s avenue of approach to the corporation of Harvard College. ~The 
year before, in 1823, when Ticknor had proposed making this visit to Vir- 
ginia, Jefferson had, by letter, distinctly emphasized the following points 
as characteristic of the new educational departure in Virginia: 
ANALYSIS OF JEFFERSON’S VIEWS. 
(1) The abolition of a prescribed curriculum for all: students, and 
consequently the overthrow of the class system. ' 
(2) The introduction of specialization, or, as Jefferson phrased it, “ ex- 
elusive application to those branches only which are to qualify them 
[students] for the particular vocations to which they are destined.” 
(3) The elective system, or “ uncontrolled choice in the lectures they 
shall choose to attend.” 3 
(4) The reduction of discipline to a minimum, “avoiding too much 
government, by requiring no useless observances, none which shall 
merely multiply occasions for dissatisfaction, disobedience, and revolt,” 
ete. 
ANALYSIS OF TICKNOR’S REFORMS. 
‘Let us now analyze the reforms actually introduced into the modern 
language department at Harvard by George Ticknor, and reviewed by 
himself in 1835. 
(1) The division by classes had been broken up in the modern lan- 
guage courses. 
(2) Progress was recognized according to “proficiency.” (This is 
the only standard of progress which has ever been recognized in the 
University of Virginia.) 
(3) Voluntary study, or the elective system. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  
128 JEFFERSON AND THE ueul OF VIRGINIA. 
(4) Reliance on the good disposition of the students, rather than 
upon discipline. | 
This correspondence of ideas, to say the least, is very remarkable. 
There are other likenesses between reforms urged by Ticknor at Har- 
vard and certain ideas of Jefferson. For example, Ticknor urged ‘in- 
struction by subjects rather than by books, so that, for instance, a student 
should not merely read Livy and Horace, but learn Latin.” The crea- 
tion of well-organized departments, controlled by a single responsible 
head, was also one of Ticknor’s favorite notions, which was carried into 
effect, however, only in the teaching of the modern languages. Ticknor 
had anne or four tutors! under his direction. His was the only depart- 
ment thus responsibly organized under the law of 1825. The system 
corresponds exactly to Jefferson’s plan for autonomous “schools,” one 
of the most efficient systems of department administration in modern aca- 
demic life. Ticknor was absolutely alone in representing these advanced 
ideas of university education and administration. In 1835 he wrote: . 
“‘T have been an active professor these fifteen years, and for thirteen 
years of the time I have been contending, against a constant opposi- 
tion, to procure certain changes which should make the large means of 
the college more effectual for the education of the community. In my 
own department I have succeeded entirely, but I can get these changes 
carried no further. As long as I hoped to advance them, I continued 
attached to the college; when 1 gave up all hope, I determined to re- 
sign.” 
THE QUESTION STATED. 
The whole spirit of Ticknor’s educational reforms was clearly foreign 
to his environment. His ideas were far in advance? of his age, and yet 
they were identical, in many respects, with the ideas of Jefferson. That 
they were consciously borrowed from him is not asserted, but the possi- 
bility of a connection between the educational projects of the two men 
has been already suggested. The question is here stated: Did Jefferson 
and Ticknor come to absolutely the same educational conclusions in in- 
dependent ways, or was some influence wafted northward from Monti- 
cello, whence Jefferson for many years had been scattering seeds of 
thought and suggestion. A single copy of one of Jefferson’s printed 
_ educational reports, like that noticed in the North American Review 
in 1820, would have explained the whole situation to Ticknor. Jeffer- 
son borrowed many of his own educational notions from that Jardin 
des Plantes—the schools of Paris, and the universities of the Old World. 
The elective system was then, and is now, the life principle of higher   
1Francis Sales, Charles Folsom, and Charles Follen all taught in Professor Tick- 
nor’s department. 
? President Eliot, in his report for 1883-84, said (p. 10): ‘‘ Professor Ticknor, who 
had so effectively promoted the legislation of 1825, was a reformer fifty years in ad- 
vance of his time. Professor Longfellow, succeeding Professor Ticknor, held in the 
main to his methods, and the reform gradually gained new ground.”
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE QUESTION STATED. ‘129 
education in Europe. Ticknor must have seen it in operation at Goet- 
tingen. But the point of inquiry is this: Did Ticknor devise that entire 
group of advanced ideas independently of the personal influence of 
Thomas Jefferson, who had been writing to him for ten years before 
those ideas were adopted at Harvard, and who called Ticknor to a pro- 
fessorship in Virginia five years before the reform of 1825? 
It must have required considerable gathered momentum of interest 
to cause Ticknor to travel all the way from Boston to Virginia to see an 
institution of learning. The writer had to spend some months in study- 
ing the history of the University of Virginia before he could muster 
enough zeal to take a few hours’ trip by cars from Baltimore to Char- 
lottesville. There was not a railroad in the country when Ticknor 
made his visit to the University of Virginia. Having announced his in- 
tention to do so eighteen months before, what was Ticknor’s motive in 
putting himself to all this trouble? There is a psychological element 
in the problem. One must discover a sufficient cause to induce a man 
to travel six hundred miles. by stage-coach and the slow conveyances of 
that period, and to be prepared to endure with patience the annoyance 
of bad roads and the discomfort of bad inns. Probably Ticknor had no 
idea of leaving Boston to become a professor in the University of Vir- 
ginia. What was le thinking of in such a long journey southward? 
Possibly for the reformation of Harvard College he was seeking the 
best American model. He was going to see Jefferson’s new univer- 
sity “fairly opened.” He found “the system” “more practical” than 
he had feared. He found “an experiment worth trying.” 
MADISON’S LETTER TO TICKNOR. 
Ticknor’s interest remained unabated. On the 6th of April, 1825, 
James Madison wrote to George Ticknor: “ Our University has been 
opened with.six or seven professors, and a limited but daily increasing 
number of students. I shall take a pleasure in complying with your re- 
quest of such information as may explain its progress. In compiling a 
code of regulations, the University has had the benefit of that of Har- 
vard, which was kindly transmitted. Of all exchanges, that of useful 
lights ought to be the freest, as doubling the stock on both sides, with- 
out cost on either. Our University is, as you observe, somewhat of an 
experimental institution. Such, however, is the nature of our federa- 
tive system, itself not alittle experimental, that it not only excites emu- 
lation without enmity, but admits local experiments of every sort, 
which, if failing, are but a partial and temporary evil; if successful, 
may become a common and lasting improvement. ” 
JOSIAH QUINCY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: 
In the life of George Ticknor, it is said (Vol. I, p. 368) that after Dr. 
Kirkland’s resignation, in 1828, and after Josiah Quincy’s succession to 
the presidency, a new spirit and vigor were infused into Harvard College, 
17036—No. 2——9 » 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  130 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
and Mr. Ticknor ‘had no longer the same difficulties to contend with 
as in earlier years.” The biographer of Quincy says he favored the elec- 
tive system.! Itis interesting to note that, the very next year after his 
election, President Quincy began to inquire about the origin and meth- 
ods of the University of Virginia. In the writings of James Madison, 
then rector of the University, is a letter to Joseph C. Cabell, indicating 
that the line of inquiry which George Ticknor had first opened, by his 
visits to Monticello and Montpellier, and by his correspondence with 
Jefferson and Madison, was now leading even the president of Harvard 
University to a knowledge of Jefterson’s original ideas, particularly with 
reference to theological education.” 
The following is the extract in question: 
“T have received a letter from Mr. Quincy, now president of Harvard 
University, expressing a wish to procure a full account of the origin, 
the progress, and arrangement of ours, including particularly what may 
have any reference to theological instruction; and requesting that he 
may be referred to the proper source of all the printed documents, that 
he may know where to apply for them. Can a set of copies be had in 
Richmond, and of whom? Mr. Quincy is so anxious on the subject that 
he was on his way to the University when the report of the fever stopped 
him.”® The historian of Harvard University was doubtless properly sup- 
plied with annual reports by Joseph C. Cabell. 
FRANCIS WAYLAND AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
There was another college president who, twenty-one years later, not 
only set out for, but actually reached the University of Virginia. That   
1Quincy: Life of Josiah Quincy, 442. President Quincy in his History of Harvard 
University, II, 344-353, 369, gives some account of the changes attempted in 1825. He 
says George Ticknor had recommended to the overseers ‘‘that the division into classes 
should be abolished, and the whole course be thrown open, as in some foreign univer- 
sities.” The latter statement has weight, but this very elective system made both 
Ticknor and Quincy interested in the University of Virginia. 
2A writer in the North American Review, January, 1820, had called attention to 
a rather startling fact. Speaking of the profession of divinity, the writer said: 
“No provision is made for instruction in this department in the University of Vir- 
ginia. As this is probably the first instance in the world of a university without any 
such provision, our readers will perhaps be gratified with seeing the portion of the 
report in which this subject is mentioned: ‘In conformity with the principles of our 
Constitution, which places all sects of religion on an equal footing; with the jeal- 
ousies of the different sects, in guarding that equality from encroachment and sur- 
prise; and with the sentiments of the Legislature in favor of freedom of religion, 
manifested on former occasions, we have proposed no professor of divinity; and the 
rather, as the proofs of the being of a God, the creator, preserver, and supreme ruler 
of the universe, the author of all the relations of morality, and of the laws and obli- 
gations these infer, will be within the province of the professor of ethics, to which, 
adding the developments of these moral obligations, of those in which all sects agree, 
with a knowledge of the languages of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, a basis will be 
formed common to all sects. Proceeding thus far without offence to the Constitution, 
we have thought it proper at this point to leave every sect to provide, as they think 
fittest, the means of further instruction in their own peculiar tenets.’”

  DOCTOR WAYLAND AND THE UNIVERSITY. 131 
visitor was Francis Wayland, D. D., LL. D., the distinguished presi- 
dent of Brown University. ‘The result of his observation,” his biog- 
raphers say, ‘‘so far as it related to the practicability and efficacy of 
the system, was highly favorable. He was particularly impressed with 
the earnestness and enthusiasm of the officers of instruction.”! Presi- 
dent Wayland had just presented a report to the corporation of Brown 
University recommending a reorganization of its system of instruction. 
The changes proposed were quite in harmony with Jefferson’s ideas of 
higher education. Both men advocated the elective system, specializa- 
tion, modern studies, degrees for merit rather than for seniority, and the 
payment of professors, at least in some measure, according to their aca- 
demic success, as shown by the number of students. 
The publication of Dr. Wayland’s report in 1850 is said to have 
marked ‘‘an era in the history of collegiate education in America.” It 
is, however, very reasonable to suppose that Dr. Wayland had heard 
something of the above ideas from Harvard or from the University of 
Virginia. Every one of these ideas had been published by Jefferson 
in educational reports more than thirty years before the date of Dr. 
Wayland’s recommendations to the corporation of Brown University. 
These ideas, moreover, had been actually realized at the University of 
Virginia, which Dr. Wayland visited doubtless for that very reason. 
At the time of George Ticknor’s visit, the University was on the point 
of architectural completion, and was not yet open to students; but its 
proposed educational features had been described by Jefferson in mani- 
fold ways, by correspondence and by published reports, before Ticknor 
returned from Europe in 1819. Ideas of the University of Virginia 
were doubtless in the minds of educational reformers in New England 
before the administrations of Wayland and Quincy, and before Ticknor 
succeeded in putting his proposed reforms into practice in 1825. One 
excellent source of information concerning the good example set in the 
South may be found as early as the year 1820. 
EDWARD EVERETT’S REVIEW OF JEFFERSON'S UNIVERSITY REPORT. 
The proceedings and report of the commissioners for the Univer- 
sity of Virginia, printed in 1818, were elaborately noticed by Edward 
Everett in the North American Review for January, 1820. He made 
the report the basis of an article of twenty-three pages on “ University 
Education”. The phenomenon of a real university at the South must 
have commanded not only Everett’s attention, but that of other thought- 
ful men of his and Ticknor’s time. Speaking of the literary fund of 
Virginia, amounting, in 1818, to $1,114,159, Mr. Everett, then one of 
the professors in Harvard College, said : “ Nothing in the United States, 
except a similar fund in Connecticut, which amounts, we believe, to

between thirteen and fourteen bundred thousand dollars, can be com. 
pared to this splendid public dotation of literature.” 
Mr. Everett copies into his article Mr. Jefferson’s entire scheme of 
studies proposed for the University of Virginia. While criticising it in 
some points, the reviewer says: “‘ We highly approve of the professor- 
ship of the modern languages, and could wish to see this example fol- 
lowed by such of our universities as have not already made provision 
for them. * * * We rejoice, too, at the kindly remembrance in 
which our almost forgotten ancestor, the Anglo-Saxon, is borne. An 
acquaintance with it unquestionably belongs to a thorough education in 
the English tongue.” 
After reviewing the entire scheme of study, Mr. Everett proceeds to 
discuss the two questions, what a university ought to be, and how it 
should be founded and supported. He regards it as a defect of the 
American, as well as of the English university system, ‘that no refer- 
ence is had to the destination of the student, but that he is required to 
dip into the whole circle of science. ‘He pleads for a higher order of 
special education, or for the elevation of universities into professional 
schools. He then takes a bold stand for the support of the highest 
education by the state. He reviews the origin and history of European 
establishments of sound learning—universities which very generally 
were founded or are supported by the state. He contrasts this fact 
with the public indifference in America to higher education: “One 
knows not where to find the cause of the indifference which the Amer- 
ican Government has at all periods testified to national education. 
One would have thought that, as a favorite object with Washington, 
and one of which he had himself in some sense laid a foundation, it 
would have found an early place among the measures adopted by the 
Government. It has perhaps been thought that national education 
should be left to the States. * * * But what have the States done? 
In the first place, have they founded any institutions for the most im- 
portant and crowning part of education—the professional—from Georgia 
to Maine, from New York to Indiana? Not one. They have, indeed, 
in some cases, patronized the existing colleges. Massachusetts, a few 
years since, granted $160,000 to her three colleges. New York has 
liberally endowed Hamilton College. Something, we believe, has been 
done in Pennsylvania; and Virginia is now establishing schools and 
universities. But are two or three hundred thousand dollars appro- 
priated to colleges scattered over the country at vast distances from 
each other, and granted by independent bodies, without mutual concert 
or system, all that the people of America think that literature is en- 
titled to?” 
After this suggestive plea for the national endowment of higher edu- 
cation, Mr. Everett considers briefly the prevailing method of support- 
ing institutions of learning by private endowment. He recognizes the 
fact that almost all of our literary establishments have been ‘“alms- 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  
EDWARD EVERETT ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. 133 
gifts of public-spirited men.” While according to private beneficence 
the “warmest gratitude and praise,” he takes the ground that it does 
not become this nation “to depend on charity for the education of our 
sons and the upholding of our national character.” He says: “ This 
dependence on single and private bequests of rich individuals is a relic 
of a state of society which never existed among us, and to which we have 
nothing else corresponding. In the Catholicages, * * * when men 
thought their peace with heaven could be made at dying for lives spent 
in violation of all its laws, by founding or endowing public institutions 
for religion and literature, there was no need of the interference of the 
state for the erection of these establishments.” Mr. Everett says that 
the situation has entirely changed. We now lack the means of “ extort- 
ing bequests from departing profligates and heretics.” There are few 
good men who can really afford to build colleges, regardless of the in- 
‘ terests of their children or natural heirs. In any case, the public has 
no right to depend solely upon private philanthropy for the endowment 
of educational institutions. Mr. Everett maintained that ‘enlightening, 
instructing, and elevating the nation” is the most sacred of public du- 
ties. ‘Who can see without shame that the Federal Government of 
America is the only government in the civilized world that has never 
founded a literary institution of any description or sort?” 
When we reflect that the establishment of university education by 
the State of Virginia was the immediate occasion of this extraordinary 
declaration, by a Harvard professor, in favor of the Federal endowment 
of the highest education, we shall realize that Jeffersonian ideas were 
capable of starting something more than a local ripple in academic cir- 
cles at Cambridge. It is very interesting to note that in 1820 the only 
two men in the Harvard faculty who had been educated in Europe 
were Edward Everett! and George Ticknor. Both were friends and 
  
1In a biographical sketch of Edward Everett (1794-1865) by Edward Everett Hale, 
in the Encyclopedia Britannica, itis stated that after resigning a Boston pastorate in 
1814, Mr. Everett devoted five years to European study, in preparation for a professor- 
ship in Greek literature at Harvard College. Entering upon his duties about the 
same time as did Mr. Ticknor, Mr. Everett, “ for five years more gave a vigorous im- 
pulse, not simply to the study of Greek, but to all the work of the college. About the 
same time he assumed charge of the North American Review, which now became a 
quarterly ; and he was indefatigable in contributing on a great variety of subjects, 
with a spirit like Sydney Smith’s in the early days of the Edinburgh Review. He 
vigorously defended American institutions against the sneers of English travellers, and 
had reason to congratulate himself on the success of a series of articles written to 
bring about a better mutual understanding between Englishmen and Americans. 
The success of his lectures in Cambridge, and the enthusiasm aroused by the rebellion 
in Greece, led him to deliver a series of popular lectures on Greek antiquities in Boston. 
They were the first lectures on purely literary or historical subjects ever delivered 
in America, and were the first steps toward a system of popular entertainment and 
education which now has very wide sweep in the United States.” In 1824 Mr. Ever- 
ett resigned his professorship and became a member of Congress. He had a seat in 
the House for ten years. In 1835 he was elected Governor of Massachusetts, and 
served in that office for four years. He was United States minister to England in

correspondents of Thomas Jefferson. The broad minds of these two 
able professors, liberalized, like Jefferson’s, by European travel and 
study, were moved by his suggestions to thoughts that will widen in 
future generations. 
JEFFERSON'S COMMENT ON THE REVIEW. 
Everett’s review of Jefferson’s report came under the eye of the latter, 
although it is doubtful whether he knew the authorship of the article. 
On the 15th of August, 1820, Jefferson wrote to his old friend, John 
Adams: “I have lately had an opportunity of reading a critique on this 
institution in your North American Review of January last, having been 
not without anxiety to see what that able work would say of us; and I 
was relieved on finding in it much coincidence of opinion, and even 
where criticisms were indulged, I found they would have been obviated 
had the developments of our plan been fuller. But these were restrained 
by the character of the paper reviewed, being merely a report of out- 
lines, not a detailed treatise, and addressed to a legislative body, not 
to a learned academy.”   
1841. He was the immediate successor of Josiah Quincy as president of Harvard College 
in 1846, resigning two years later. He was Secretary of State under Fillmore, and 
later became Senator from Massachusetts. Resigning on account of his health in 
1854, he devoted the rest of his life to literary pursuits. He delivered his last great 
oration at Gettysburg in 1865, an effort which resulted in his death that year.

CHAPTER X. 
JEFFERSON’S SCHOOL OF LAW, POLITICS, AND HISTORY. 
PATRIOTIC MOTIVES OF JEFFERSON. 
Patriotic motives moved Jefferson to the idea that youth who were 
to become American citizens needed such training in moral and political 
science as would fit them for the practical duties of citizenship and self- 
government. Nothing is clearer in Jefferson’s educational philosophy 
than his recognition of the importance of moral and political education 
under our American system of government. Our American colleges 
and universities have hardly yet risen to the Jeffersonian ideal in either 
of these great branches of education. As a matter of fact, there is 
almost no recognized connection between morals and politics, either in 
our organized systems of instruction or in political life. 
Jefferson had the idea of establishing a school of law and polities, 
based upon ethics, natural science, and the ancient and modern lan- 
guages, which were to be associated respectively with ancient and 
modern history and literature. All the arts and sciences were to be 
tributary to the education of American citizens for their highest 
duties. Separate the patriotic idea from thé institution of the Univer- 
sity of Virginia and you have removed its roof and crown. Jefferson 
repeatedly expressed the idea that the University was patriotic in pur- 
pose ; it was to be for the benefit of his State and native country. He 
looked upon the appointment of English professors “as one of the effi- 
cacious means of promoting that cordial good will which it is so much 
the interest of both nations to cherish.” He wrote to the Hon. J. Evelyn 
Denison, a member of Parliament, that it was the interest of America 
to receive instruction through English teachers, and it was England’s 
interest to furnish it; “for these two nations holding cordially together 
have nothing to fear from the united world. They will be the models 
for regenerating the condition of man, the sources from which represent- 
ative government is to flow over the whole earth.” Through Jeffer- 
son’s plans for university education ran a broad and generous purpose; 
but he was practical enough to see that America must have her own 
political philosophy.

  136 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
JEFFERSON’S INFLUENCE UPON POLITICAL EDUCATION. 
Jefferson early interested himself in devising a proper system of polit- 
ical education for American youth. As far back as 1816 he recommended 
to the president of William and Mary College Destutt Tracy’s Review 
of Montesquieu as ‘the best elementary book on the principles of gov- 
ernment and as equally sound and corrective in political economy.” He 
said Chipman’s and Priestley’s Principles of Government and the Fed- 
eralist were excellent, but not comparable to the above review forfunda- 
mental principles. Tracy’s work was actually adopted by Dr. Smith 
for the students of William and Mary College. A more formal treatise 
by Tracy upon political economy Jefferson caused to be translated. He 
revised the copy and proof with his own hands and prepared an anony- 
mous prospectus! or preface to the work, sketching the history of politi- 
eal economy and ranking Tracy as a worthy successor of Jean Baptiste 
Say, Adam Smith, Dupont de Nemours, Turgot, LeFrosne, Gournay, 
and Quesnay who were the founders of the modern science of politi- 
cal economy. ‘This preface is perhaps the first attempt of an American 
to treat economics from an historical point of view. The translation, 
published by Joseph Milligan, of Georgetown, D. C., in 1817, is proba- 
bly the first systematic treatise on political economy that ever appeared 
in this country. The work was translated from the French manuscript, 
the publication of which had been forbidden in France, as was Tracy’s 
Review of Montesquieu, which Jefferson brought out as a political text- 
book on the science @f government for American youth. 
Thus Jefferson prepared the way for the entrance of political science 
into American colleges. He deserves the credit of first introducing at 
Williamsburg, as early as 1779, this modern current; but it was strength- 
ened by correspondence with the French economists, Count Destutt Tracy 
and Dupont dé Nemours, and with the English refugee, Judge Cooper, 
who was one of the earliest economists in the United States and the 
first professor appointed for the University of Virginia. Into this in- 
stitution the modern current was turned by Jefferson, and from thence 
it hurried on to the College of South Carolina, whither Cooper? was   
1 See Jefferson’s letter to Milligan, the publisher, April 6, 1816. 
2Professor Cooper brought out in the year 1819 an adaptation of Say’s Political 
Economy for the use of American youth. This work continued to be used as a text- 
book by Francis Lieber, whose annotated copy is now in the possession of the his- 
torical department of the Johns Hopkins University. Cooper early dabbled in eco- 
nomics while living at Carlisle, Pa., where he appears to haye edited or contributed 
to a publication called the Emporium. Jefferson wrote him January 16, 1814: ‘You 
have given us, in your Emporium, Bollman’s medley on Political Economy. It isa 
work of one who sees a little of everything and the whole of nothing, and were it 
not for your own notes on it, a sentence of which throws more just light on the sub- 
ject than all his pages, we should regret the place it occupies of more useful matter.” 
In the same letter Jefferson acknowledges the receipt of Cooper’s edition of Justinian, 
with notes, probably the first work on Roman law ever published in America, and 
advises the historical study of the common law of England, with valuable sugges- 
tions to that end.

called, and where he was succeeded by Francis Lieber, the great German 
tributary to American political science. 
POLITICAL TEXT-BOOKS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
When the University of Virginia was founded, it became a vital 
question in Jefferson’s mind what political philosophy should be taught 
to students. While he believed in general in leaving the matter of 
text-books entirely to the professors, yet he maintained in a letter to 
Cabell, February 3, 1825, “there is one branch in which we are the 
best judges, in which heresies may be taught of so interesting a char- 
acter to our own State, and to the United States, as to make it a duty 
in us to lay down the principles which are to be taught. It is that of 
government. Mr. Gilmer being withdrawn, we know not who his suc- 
cessor may be. He may be a Richmond lawyer, or one of that school * 
of quondam Federalism, now consolidation. It is our duty to guard 
against such principles being disseminated among our youth, and the 
diffusion of that poison, by a previous prescription of the texts to be 
followed in their discourses.” Thereupon Jefferson inclosed a list of 
authorities which he and Madison had previously agreed upon as suffi- 
ciently sound for American pedagogical purposes. While recognizing 
the impropriety of using the University of Virginia as a school of party 
politics, the critic can really find no general fault with the political 
pabulum chosen for Virginia youth at that period. The works recom- 
mended were the product of their time, and wére congenial to the 
minds of most Virginians. 
The following list of authorities appears to have been agreed upon 
by Jefferson and Madison} after due consultation : 
(1) Sidney’s Discourses and Locke’s Essay on CivilGovernment. Madi- 
son said these were ‘‘ admirably calculated to impress on young minds 
the right of nations to establish their own governments, and to inspire 
a love of free ones,” although, as Madison admits, they “ afford no aid 
in guarding our republican charters against constructive violence.” 
(2) The Declaration of Independence, “as the fundamental act of 
union of these States.” 
(3) The Federalist, ‘‘as the most authentic exposition of the text of 
the Federal Constitution, as understood by the body which prepared 
and the authority which accepted it.” Madison adds that the Federal- 
ist ‘“‘has been actually admitted into two universities, if not more—those 
of Harvard and Rhode Island—but probably at the choice of the pro- 
fessors, without any injunction from superior authority.” 
(4) The Virginia Document of 1799. This was a political commen- 
tary on the famous Virginia resolutions of 1798,! which affirmed that the 
1Upon this point see Madison’s Writings, III, 481-482, and IV, 30. The Virginia 
Document may be found reprinted in Niles’s Register, 1833. An interesting discussion 
of a similar set of resolutions, prepared chiefly by Jefferson, may be found in the Na- 
tion for May 5, 1887, entitled ‘‘ The Kentucky Resolutions in a New Light,” by Miss

Constitution was a compact between the States, urged the duty of the 
States to defend their reserved rights, and declared the unconstitu- 
tionality of the Alien and Sedition Laws, which abridged free speech and 
the freedom of the press. 
(5) The Inaugural Speech and Farewell Address of George Washing- 
ton. These later documents were suggested by Madison, in addition to 
Jefferson’s list, ‘as conveying political lessons of peculiar value.” Madi- 
son, however, concluded that “after all, the most effectual safeguard 
against heretical intrusions into the school of politics will be an able 
and orthodox professor,' whose course of instruction will be an example 
to his successors, and may carry with it a sanction from the visitors.” 
POLITICAL ORTHODOXY. 
These careful provisions by the two most experienced statesmen in 
Virginia for the maintenance of political orthodoxy at their new Univer- 
sity are very interesting, both from an historical and from a psychological 
point of view. While protesting against sectarianism? in education,   
Sarah Nicholas Randolph, of Baltimore, who is a great-granddaughter of Mr. Jeffer- 
son, and who found original material bearing upon the Kentucky resolutions among 
his manuscripts now preserved in Washington. 
1In September, 1833, Madison, at that time rector of the University of Virginia, in 
the eighty-third year of his age, wrote to Mr. W. A. Duer, who had prepared the out- 
lines of a book on the constitutional jurisprudence of the United States, with the 
evident hope of introducing the work, when published, as a text-book into the Univer- 
sity of Virginia. Madison said: ‘‘ The choice of text and class books is left to the pro- 
fessors respectively. The only exception is in the school of law, in which the subject 
of government is included, and on that the board of visitors have prescribed, as text 
authorities, the Federalist, the Resolutions of Virginia in 1798, with the comment 
on them in 1799, and Washington’s Farewell Address. The use, therefore, that will 
be made of any analogous publications will depend on the discretion of the professor 
himself. His personal opinions, I believe, favor very strict rules of expounding the 
Constitution of the United States.” Madison’s writings, IV, 308. Madison adds an 
interesting historical point: ‘‘ You are, I presume, not ignorant that your father was 
the author of several papers auxiliary to the numbers in the Federalist. They ap- 
peared, I believe, in the Gazette of Mr. Childs.” 
2Tn a letter to Edward Everett, dated March 19, 1823, Madison said: “A university 
with sectarian professorships becomes, of course, a sectarian monopoly; with pro- 
fessorships of rival sects, it would be an arena of theological gladiators. Without 
any such professorships it may incur, for a time at least, the imputation of irreligious 
tendencies, if not designs. The last difficulty was thought more manageable than 
either of the others.” Writings of Madison, III, 307. 
Madison does not mean that the first professors in the University of Virginia were 
irreligious men or without church connections. As a matter of fact, most of the pro- 
fessors were Episcopalians. Dr. Dunglison, the original head of the school of medi- 
cine, once said in a private letter: ‘(I was an Episcopalian, so was Mr. Tucker, Mr. 
Long, Mr. Key, Mr. Bonnycastle, and Dr. Emmet; Dr. Blaetterman, I think, was a 
Lutheran, but I do not know so much about his religion as I do about that of the 
rest. There certainly was not a Unitarian among us.” Jefferson regarded himself 
as a Christian and as a Unitarian, basing his views upon the writings of Dr. Joseph 
Priestley, who was a Unitarian clergyman. Jefferson was baptized into the Episcopal 
Church and usually attended its services, joining in the responses and prayers.  
-P-A-G-E-167
  
  POLITICAL ORTHODOXY. 139 
they were deliberately substituting for it party control. There could be 
no possible objection to students discussing any or all of these historical 
documents; but the idea of imposing them as a permanent educational or 
party yoke, to the exclusion of other good means of political training, is 
intolerable. Madison himself saw the difficulty of chaining up a profes- 
sor to one set of bocks, and proposed to secure an “orthodox” man and 
give him free rein. ‘Vhat is precisely the kind of man that every sec- 
tarian college has been honestly striving to discover for every depart- 
ment of education. It always has been, and perhaps always will be, 
a difficult question to determine the standard of “ orthodoxy” in a pro- 
gressive state of society, but there is a steady drift of opinion, in this 
nineteenth century, toward more tolerant forms. While recognizing 
with Jefferson and Madison the importance of “orthodox” political 
education, in the sense of loyalty to State and country, is it not better 
for every college and State university to teach political science rather 
than party spirit? And is not a scientific criterion of “ orthodoxy ” 
worthy of recognition in every branch of learning? 
Ina letter to James Madison, dated February 17, 1826, Jefferson 
called attention to the importance of appointing a law professor who was 
sound in the political faith: “‘ In the selection of our la w professor, we 
must be rigorously attentive to his political principles. You will recollect 
that before the Revolution, Coke [on] Littleton was the universal element. 
ary book of law students, and a sounder whig never wrote, nor of pro. 
founder learning in the orthodox doctrines of the British Constitution, or 
in what were called English liberties. You remember also that our law- 
yers were then all whigs. But when his black-letter text and uncouth 
but cunning learning got out of fashion, and the honied Mansfieldism of 
Blackstone became the students’ horn-book, from that moment that 
profession (the nursery of our Congress) began to slide into toryism, 
and nearly all the young brood of lawyers now are of that hue. They 
suppose themselves, indeed, to be whigs, because they no longer know 
what whiggism or republicanism means. It is in our seminary that 
that vestal flame is to be kept alive; it is thence it is to spread anew 
over our own and the sister States. If we are true and vigilant in our 
trust, within a dozen or twenty years a majority of our own Legislature 
will be from one school, and many disciples will have carried its doc- 
trines home with them to their several States, and will have leavened 
thus the whole mass.” Jefferson carried his patriotism rather too far 
when he attempted to make provision for the exclusion from the Univer- 
sity of federalism, which he regarded as political heresy. By dictating a 
republican course of instruction he was guilty of narrowing political 
science to a party platform. But in the essential idea, however 
illogical from a cosmopolitan point of view, Jefferson was in a meas- 
  
Whatever his private convictions, he could truthfully say he “never attempted to 
make a convert nor wished to change another’s creed.” See Randall’s Life of Thomas 
Jefferson, Vol. IiI, Chap. XIV, on “ Jefferson’s Religious Views.” /

ure right. To a certain extent, American youth require American 
training in the duties of citizenship. There are lines in politics, as in 
religion, which must be drawn. ‘In the former they mark what men 
call patriotism, national independence, loyalty to kindred, country, or 
race. 
JEFFERSON ON THE STUDY OF HISTORY. 
It was provided in Jefferson’s educational plan that ancient history 
and ancient geography should be studied in connection with the ancient 
languages, and modern history and modern geography in connection 
with modern languages. The representatives of these great historical’ 
fields were George Long on the one side, and George Blaetterman on 
the other. From the excellence of the historical and geographical! work 
represented by Long’s History of Rome and Long’s Classical Atlas, we 
may rest assured that his teaching in these branches was of a high or- 
der. Of Blaetterman’s work we have only the presumptive evidence of 
German training, which has favored history most decidedly since the 
time of the Napoleonic wars, when the restoration of Germany began in 
schools and universities. Jefferson’s own views upon the study of history 
are precisely stated in a letter addressed to one of the newly-appointed 
professors, and dated October 25, 1825: 
“T know not whether the professors to whom ancient and modern 
history are assigned in the University have yet decided on the course 
of historical reading which they will recommend to their schools. If 
they have, I wish this letter to be considered as not written, as their 
course, the result of mature consideration, will be preferable to any- 
thing I could recommend. Under this uncertainty, and the rather as 
you are of neither of these schools, I may hazard some general ideas, to 
be corrected by what they may recommend hereafter. 
“In all cases I prefer original authors to compilers. For a course 
of ancient history, therefore, of Greece and Rome especially, I should 
advise the usual suite of Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Diodorus, 
Livy, Cesar, Suet onius, Tacitus, and Dion, in their originals if under- 
stood, and in translations if not. For its continuation to the final 
destruction of the Empire we must then be content with Gibbons [sic], 
a compiler, and with Ségur for a judicious recapitulation of the whole. 
After this general course, there are a number of particular histories 
filling up the chasms, which may be read at leisure in the progress of 
life. Such is Arrian, Q. Curtius, Polybius, Sallust, Plutarch, Dionysius 
[of] Halicarnassus, Micasi, ete. The ancient universal history should be 
on our shelves as a book of general reference, the most learned and 
most faithful, perhaps, that ever was written. Its style is very plain 
but perspicuous.   
1Long wrote a very valuable work on historical geography, and a treatise on the _ 
Geography of America and the West Indies. He was also one of the editors of a 
special work on the Geography of Great Britain (Part I, England and Wales. Lon- 
don, no date).
-P-A-G-E-169
JEFFERSON ON HISTORY. 141 
“Tn modern ‘history, there are but two nations with whose course 
it is interesting to us to be intimately acquainted, to wit: France and 
England. For the former, Millot’s General History of France may be 
sufficient to the period when 1 Davila commences. He should be fol- 
lowed by Péréfixe, Sully, Voltaire’s Louis XIV and XV, Lacretelle’s 
XVIII™e Sidcle, Marmontel’s Régence, Foulongion’s French Revolu- 
tion, and Madame de Staél’s, making up by a succession of particular 
history the general one which they want. 
“ Of England there is as yet no general history so faithful as Rapin’s. 
He may be followed by Ludlow, Fox, Belsham, Hume, and Brodie. 
Hume’s, were it faithful, would be the finest piece of history which has 
ever been written by man. Its unfortunate bias may be partly ascribed 
to the accident of his having written backwards. His maiden work 
was the History of the Stuarts. It was a first essay to try his strength — 
before the public. And whether as a Scotchman be had really a par- 
tiality for that family, or thought that the lower their degradation the 
more fame he should acquire by raising them up to some favor, the 
object of his work was an apology for them. He spared nothing, there- 
fore, to wash them white and to palliate their misgovernment. For 
this purpose he suppressed truths, advanced falsehoods, forged author- 
ities, and falsified records. All thisis proved on him unanswerably by 
Brodie. But so bewitching was his style and manner, that his readers 
were unwilling to doubt anything, swallowed everything, and all Eng- 
land becaine tories by the magic of his art. His pen revolutionized the 
public sentiment of that country more completely than the standing 
armies could ever have done, which were so much dreaded and depre- 
eated by the patriots of that day.” 
Jefferson then proceeds, in a somewhat elaborate way, to criticise 
Hume’s history of the dynasties preceding the Stuarts, in which Hume 
maintained the thesis of his first work, that “it was the people who en- 
eroached on the sovereign, not the sovereign who usurped the rights of 
the people.” Hume’s third work was a complete history of England, 
basing its Constitution upon the physical force of the Norman conquest. 
Condemning this philosophy of English history, Jefferson maintained 
that whig historians “have always gone back to the Saxon period for the 
true principles of their Constitution, while the tories and Hume, their 
Corypheus, date it from the Norman conquest, and hence conclude that 
the continual claim by the nation of the good old Saxon laws, and the 
struggles to recover them, were ‘encroachments of the people on the 
crown, and not usurpations of the crown on the people’” Jefferson said 
that Hume, with Brodie, was the last of English histories which the stu- 
dent should read. “If first read, Hume makes an English tory, from 
whence it is an easy step to American toryism [Federalism]. But there 
is a history, by Baxter, in which, abridging somewhat by leaving out 
some entire incidents as less interesting now than when Hume wrote, 
he has given the rest in the identical words of Hume, except that 
when he comes to a fact falsified, he states it truly, and when to a sup-

  142 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
pression of truth, he supplies it, never otherwise changing a word. It is, 
in fact, an editic expurgation of Hume. Those who shrink from the 
volume of Rapin may read this first, and from this lay a first foundation 
in a basis of truth. 
_ * For modern Continental history, a very general idea may be first 
aimed at, leaving for future and occasional reading the particular his- 
tories of such countries as may excite curiosity at the time. This may 
be obtained from Mallet’s Northern Antiquities, Voltaire’s Esprit et 
Maurs des Nations, Millot’s Modern History, Russell’s Modern Europe, 
Hallam’s Middle Ages, and Robertson’s Charles V. 
“You ask what book I would recommend to be first read in law. I 
am very glad to find from a conversation with Mr. Gilmer, that he con- 
siders Coke [on] Littleton, as methodized by Thomas, as unquestion- 
ably the best elementary work, and the one which will be the text-book 
of his school. It is now as agreeable reading as Blackstone, and much 
more profound. I pray you to consider this hasty and imperfectsketch 
as intended merely to prove my wish to be useful to you, and that with 
it you will accept the assurance of my esteem and respect.” 
Thus, it is evident that Jefferson regarded both law and history as 
formative elements in the training of patriotic citizens who should be- 
come defenders of popular rights. The stress which he laid upon the 
teaching of early English, or “Anglo-Saxon”, forms of government is 
most remarkable from two points of view. First, it shows that his polit- 
ical principles were historic and genuinely English,' rather than purely 
philosophical and French. Second, Jefferson’s “ Anglo-Saxon” prin- 
ciples, if they had been taught in the University of Virginia and prac- 
tically applied in local self-government, would have undermined that 
reverence for Norman principles which was the bane of Virginia and 
of the whole South for nearly two generations after the death of Jet- 
ferson. 
POLITICAL ECONOMY. 
Political economy appears to have been assigned to Professor Tucker 
during the first year of the University. Madison, acknowledging, 
December 26, 1826, the receipt of a copy of Dr. Cooper’s published lect- 
ures on political economy, said that, before he had time to look into the 
work, ‘I had an opportunity of handing it over to Professor Tucker, 
of our University, now charged with that branch of instruction, who 
wished to see it, as I did that he should, not doubting that it well 
merited his perusal.” By the same letter Madison acknowledges the 
receipt of Cooper’s lectures on Civil Government and on the Consti- 
tution of the United States.? It is remarkable to find, at the very   
1 Jefferson’s views on the Anglo-Saxon origin of the English Constitution are finely 
illustrated in his letter to Maj. John Cartwright, June 5, 1824. 
2It is interesting to note that Dr. Cooper’s immediate successor at Columbia, S. C., 
Francis Lieber, should have elaborated his class lectures into a magnum opus in the 
same field as Dr. Cooper's work. Lieber’s masterpiece is called Civil Liberty and 
Self: Government.

opening of the school of Jaw and politics, these published lectures 
coming into the hands of its friends from aman who was originally 
chosen to represent those very subjects. At that time Dr. Cooper was 
undoubtedly the ablest professor in the country in the field of politics 
and economics. One cannot refrain from wishing that he might have 
had a fair chance, among that original staff of eminent professors, to 
develop those very subjects which the University of Virginia, by reason 
of the exactions of other important studies, found no early opportunity 
to foster. But the eccentricities of Dr. Cooper’s character and genius 
stood in the way of academic success, even in South Carolina. 
CONCLUSION. 
THE HOLY CAUSE OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
No one can read from beginning to end the correspondence between 
Jefferson and Cabell without increasing amazement at the many ob- 
stacles, the local opposition, the rivalries, jealousies, intolerance, indif- 
ference, and popular lethargy over which these two men triumphed 
from 1817 to 1826, by their resolute perseverance and indomitable 
courage. At one time of financial emergency Cabell announced his 
return to the Senate in these courageous words to Jefferson: ‘TI re- 
turned hastily over stormy rivers, and frozen roads, to rejoin the band ~ 
of steadfast patriots engaged in the holy cause of the University.” 
It would be difficult to find in our entire educational history anything 
more heroic than that brave fight for the University of Virginia, a 
struggle begun and sustained for fifty years (1776-1826) by Jefferson, 
who was past fourscore when he saw his hopes fulfilled. To study the 
history of those fifty years gives onean exalted sense of the devotion and 
self-sacrifice of the Sage of Monticello in the execution of the greatest 
project of his life. What pains were bestowed upon those letters, which 
seem to us so easily written, and upon those numerous educational bills 
and reports which the student hurries through in a few minutes! The 
following, from a letter to Cabell, December 28, 1822, when Jefferson 
was in his eightieth year, shows what infinite labor those writings 
cost: 
“You propose to me to write to half a dozen gentlemen on this sub- 
ject. You do not know, my dear sir, how great is my physical inability 
to write. The joints of [my] right wrist and fingers, in consequence of an 
ancient dislocation, are become so stiffened that I can write but at the 
pace of a snail. The copying our report, and my letter lately sent 
to the Governor, being seven pages only, employed me laboriously a 
whole week. The letter I am now writing you [three printed octavo 
pages] has taken me two days. I have been obliged, therefore, to - 
withdraw from letter-writing but in cases of the most indispensable

urgency. A letter of a page or two costs me a day of labor, and a 
painful labor.” 
Cabell’s more active service to the University in the Virginia Legis- 
lature lasted for about twenty years. His record there is all the more 
remarkable, because he was a man of delicate constitution. He suf- 
fered from malaria and hemorrhages of the lungs. His declaration,

that he could not risk his life in a better cause than that of the Univer- 
sity, was no unmeaning phrase, for he repeatedly exposed himself with 
the utmost daring in those arduous educational campaigns. Only once 
did he falter. In 1821, when suffering from bodily weakness, worn out

with public speaking, utterly weary of politics, and of Richmond hotels, 
where he had lived for thirteen winters, and longing for return to “ do- 
mestic, rural, and literary leisure,” Cabell wrote to Jefferson, expressing 
a purpose of speedily withdrawing from the Legislature. Then it was 
that the old hero felt his soul stir within him. He wrote a letter from 
the heights of Monticello, words of almost prophetic significance, moving

Cabell to remain loyal to the greatest purpose of his life. Appealing 
at once to his patriotism and hissense of duty, Jeffersonsaid : “I know 
well your devotion to your country, and your foresight of the awful 
scenes coming on her, sooner or later. With this foresight, what service 
can we ever render her [the University] equal to this? What object of 
our lives can we propose so important? What interest of our own which 
ought not to be postponed to this? Health, time, labor, on what in the 
single life which nature has given us, can these be better bestowed 
than on this immortal boon to our country? The exertions and the 
mortifications are temporary; the benefit eternal. If any member of 
our coliege of visitors could justifiably withdraw from this sacred duty, 
it would be myself, who, ‘quadragenis stipendiis jamdudum peractis, have 
neither vigor of body nor mind left to keep the field; but I will die in 
the last ditch. And so, I hope, you will, my friend, as well as our firm- 
breasted brothers and colleagues, Mr. Johnson and General Brecken- 
ridge. * * * Pray then, dear and very dear sir, do not think of 
deserting us, but view the sacrifices which seem to stand in your way 
as the lesser duties, and such as ought to be postponed to this, the 
greatest of all. Continue with us in these holy labors, until having 
seen their accomplishment, we may say with old Simeon, ‘nunc dimittas, 
Domine?” + 
Cabell replied, “It is not in my nature to resist such an appeal.” 
Without further words upon the subject of domestic comfort, rural 
pleasure, or literary ease, this noble scholar returned to politics and to 
the business of sustaining the University by good legislation. He con- 
tinued to serve the institution as legislator, visitor, and rector until his 
death, in 1856. Such was the self-sacrificing and devoted spirit which 
entered into the life and constitution of the University of Virginia. 
The final recognition of the university idea and its loyal maintenauce 
through every crisis, by the common people of Virginia, illustrates 
the truth of Robert Browning’s verse: 
“A people is but the attempt of many 
To rise to the completer life of one.” 
THE FATHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
Emerson’s words, with which the writer began the present mono- 
graph, recur now with renewed force: “An institution is the lengthened 
shadow of one man.” This saying has peculiar significance to one who 
has studied with some care the origin of the University of Virginia, and 
who has stood in front of Jefferson’s house at Monticello and looked - 
across that beautiful country toward the “ academical village” which 
represents the best energies of his life. From that height Jefferson

correct the error. We can well believe it; for in August, 1820, he wrote 
to John Adams: ‘“ Our University, four miles distant, gives me fre- 
quent exercise, and the oftener, as I direct its architecture.” The build- 
ings of the University of Virginia are Jefferson’s thoughts material- 
ized in artistic form. If those pavilions and that grand rotunda should 
ever be shaken down by an earthquake, the future archeologist might 
perhaps find the name of Jefferson upon every stone in the ruins. 
Jefferson died with the feeling that the University was not yet fully 
appreciated by his fellow-citizens; but he was confident that posterity 
would do it justice.. He once wrote to Cabell: ‘‘I have long been sen- 
sible that while I was endeavoring to render our country the greatest 
of all services, and placing our rising generation on the level of our sis- 
ter States (which they have proudly held heretofore), I was discharging 
the odious function of a physician pouring medicine down the throat of 
a patient insensible of needing it. I am so sure of: the future approba- 
tion of posterity, and of the inestimable effect we shall have produced 
in the elevation of our country by what we have done, as that I can 
not repent of the part I have borne in co-operation with my colleagues.” 
The University was the noblest work of Jefferson’s life. His system of 
higher education marks the continuation of his personal, vitalizing in- 
‘fluence in Virginia and in the country at large more truly than does 
any other of his original creations. ! 
By order of Congress a new monument! has lately been erected upon 
the site of the old and battered shaft which stood over his grave in that 
little burying-ground by the road-side, to the left as one goes toward 
the valley from Jefferson’s old home. The new monument bears the in- 
scription copied from the old stone, which has been piously removed to 
the campus of the University of the State of Missouri, at Columbia: 
«Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of 
American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Free- 
dom, and Father of the University of Virginia. Born April 2d, 1743, 
0.8. Died July 4th, 1826.” 
Here lies aman who gave the best that he had to his country, his State, 
his friends and neighbors, and to the University which bears not his 
name but that of Virginia. He sacrificed alarge private fortune in ex-

CHAPTER XI. 
THE INFLUENCE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA UPON 
SOUTHERN LIFE AND THOUGHT. 
AN INQUIRY INTO ITS CAUSES AND EXTENT. 
By WILLIAM P. TRENT, M. A. 
INTRODUCTORY. 
Doctor Adams has asked me to write an essay upon the above subject 
to serve as a supplementary chapter to his work upon Thomas Jefferson 
and his relations to the University of Virginia. As an alumnus of the 
University,! and as a modest student of institutional history, I am 
naturally interested in the good work Dr. Adams has undertaken, and I 
have not thought it right to allow any feelings of diffidence to prevent 
me from lending what help I can to his labors. 
In studying the influences exerted by laws, by customs, or by insti- 
tutions, it is by no means easy to hold the balance even; we are all in- 
clined to forget that persuasion is not proof, oy that denunciation has no 
place in history. I fear that mine is by no means a steady hand; but 
as a faulty experiment generally brings about others and, in time, the 
true one, I am inclined to proceed with my subject without further 
preface. 
That the University of Virginia has had an appreciable influence 
upon the South goes without saying. The very fact that the institu- 
tion is living and working to-day proves it. If further argument were 
needed, I should simply point to the creative genius of its founder, and 
to the fact that a professor in a sister university has worked for months 
over its early history. This last fact, by the way, shows the good 
effects of institutional studies in subduing that spirit of prejudice and 
captious criticism which too often alienates institutions that should work 
in harmony. It remains, then, for us to consider the causes, the extent, 
and the character of this influence. 
1 The University of Virginia is known throughout the South as ‘‘ the University,” 
and this is my excuse for using an expression otherwise indefensible.

INFLUENCE UPON SOUTHERN LIFE AND THOUGHT. 151 
Manifestly these three objects of inquiry are interdependent; it is 
equally manifest that we are practically confined to two fields of inves- 
tigation. On the one hand, we may study the workings of the Univer- 
sity, both in its history and on the spot, and from such study arrive at 
what seem to be the causes of the influence the existence of which we 
have taken for granted ; on the other hand, we may follow its students 
into the world, watch their careers, and from thousands of particular 
facts obtain by induction such general conclusions as to the extent and 
character of their influence as a fair mind might be expected to make. 
When a friend of an institution endeavors to prove its usefulness, he 
will, as a rule, employ the first method; but it is equally the rule that 
he only convinces neutrals, or those who were partly inclined to his 
view of the matter; he will hardly silence strenuous opponents. If an 
appeal be made to statistics, opposition will frequently be silenced, but 
this, too, has limitations to its suecess. Unless the results obtained in 
the shape of statistics are given in a clear and attractive manner, they 
will repel neutrals and half-way friends; and, unless opponents are 
eandid and truth-loving, the most convincing figures will be as barren 
of result as the mere dictum of an uninformed partisan. These are the 
two dangers that beset all those who would fain lay before the public 
the results of their institutional studies. ; 
I.— ANALYSIS OF THE WORKINGS OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
If this essay were to be published independently of Dr. Adams’s 
monograph, I should have to devote some space to an examination of 
Jefferson’s ideas with regard to higher education, in order to fairly be- 
gin any study of the workings of the University ; butas Dr. Adams has 
already treated this subject ably and fully in the preceding pages, my 
labor in this respect will be considerably abridged. It suffices to say 
that the broadness of Mr. Jefferson’s views and the suggestive quality 
of his genius are nowhere more strikingly displayed than in his choice 
of the lines along which the work of his favorite institution-was to run. 
These lines the University has in the main adhered to. The combina- 
tion of the monastic with the democratic spirit, the high standard and 
broad scope of study which he advised, the honor system of discipline, 
and the merging of party and sect into literary and scientific fellowship 
all survive in the University, and in their results bear testimony to the 
wisdom of the mind that first combined them. 
LIST OF CAUSES OF THE UNIVERSITY’S INFLUENCE. 
I shall now present to the reader a list of the causes or working 
forces which, in my opinion, have given extent and character to the in- 
fluence of the University upon Southern life and thought. A brief dis- 
cussion of each head will follow, and we shall then be brought to the 
second division of our subject, which corresponds to the second method 
of investigation before laid down. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
152 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
These chief causes or working forces may be stated as follows: 
(1) The continued refusal of the faculty and visitors to rest satisfied 
with the present standard of requirement in the several studies or with 
the number of subjects taugut, and the constant tendency to improve- 
ment in both of these particulars. 
(2) The substitution of the elective for the curricular system of in 
struction. | 
(3) The honor system of discipline. 
(4) The even balance held between sects and parties. 
(5) The high qualifications, both mental and moral, of the men chosen 
as instructors. 
(6) The unique position of the University in the South; a position 
largely brought about by the existence of the above-mentioned causes, 
and by others to be stated hereafter. 
STRIVING AFTER BETTER RESULTS. 
We shall now consider the first claim made for the University. 
In 1826 the faculty consisted of eight professors, occupying the fol. 
lowing chairs: Ancient languages, modern languages (including Anglo. 
Saxon—see page 92), mathematics, natural philosophy, natural history, 
anatomy and medicine, moral philosophy, and law. Iam informed by 
the present chairman of the faculty, Col. Charles S. Venable (to whom 
I amindebted for kind assistance), that the examinations held during the 
first years of the University were as searching and thorough, in propor- 
tion to theextent of the course, as those now in vogue, and of the thorough- 
ness of the latter I am qualified to speak by experience. In 1827 the 
medical department was organized and the work distributed to three pro- 
fessors; in 1859 there were four professors and a special demonstrator of 
anatomy. Although there have been few clinical advantages connected 
with this school, the thoroughness of its teaching has never failed to at- 
tract students, and the men who obtain its diploma are uniformly sue- 
cessful in any collegethey may subsequently attend. In1851an adjunct 
professor of law was appointed, who became a full professor in 1854. In 
1856 the chair of ancient languages was superseded by two new chairs, 
those of Latin and of Greek and Hebrew. In 1857 the school of history 
and general literature was established. Since that time the faculty has 
been enlarged by the appointment of professors in applied mathematics, 
in natural history and geology, in analytical chemistry, in English, in 
scientific agriculture, zodlogy, and botany, and in practical astronomy. 
The professor of moral philosophy had Jong ago delivered lectures on 
political economy ; but in 1882 this subject was handed over to the pro- 
. fessor of history, whose school is now known as that of historical 
science. In 1887 the faculty consisted of nineteen full professors, to 
whom may be added five special instructors. All this indicates a natural 
and steady growth; chairs have been created to meet the needs of the

INFLUENCE UPON SOUTHERN LIFE AND THOUGHT. 153 
time; there has been no rush orover-eagerness to make: a display of 
high-sounding names on the pages of the catalogue. 
If inquiry be directed to the workings of these several schools, a 
conformity to the laws of evolution will be discovered which would, I 
suspect, fairly shock the professors in charge. Attention has already 
been called to the strictness of the early examinations. The method 
of class-instruction has always been by lectures, supplemented by text- 
book work. Of course the horrible state of secondary education 
throughout the South cramped and retarded the development of the 
carly schools ; but when University graduates betook themselves to this 
labor-craving field, an advance in method and scope of teaching became 
possible—an advance characterized by the same natural and steady 
growth to which [before alluded. for want of space I am not able to par- 
ticularize upon this subject; but when I come to spéak of Dr. Gessner 
Harrison, who succeeded Mr. George Long in the chair of ancient 
languages, we shall see that the philological work of Bopp was being 
made familiar to students in the University of Virginia at a time when 
not even the professors of other colleges in this country had realized © 
the immense im portance of the great German’s undertaking. The chair 
of moral philosophy might be selected as another example of this 
academical evolution, if I may be allowed the phrase. Within my own 
memory two lectures a week have been added to this course. 
: EVOLUTION OF DEGREES. 
If attention be turned to the degrees awarded by the University, the 
same spirit of adaptation to the needs of the time will be perceived, per- 
haps, however, in a less degree. It was early recognized by the found- 
ers of the University that an institution was needed, upon the thor- 
oughness of whose work the utmost reliance could be placed. A glance 
at the state of secondary education proved this. Thoughtful men were 
beginning to see that it was folly to intrust their children to teachers 
whose want of qualification would only be discovered after they had 
ruined the minds of their pupils. Hence it was that Princeton was 
crowded with Southern students; and hence it was that Mr. Jefferson 
and his coadjutors determined that their new University, by giving its 
honors only to the highly meritorious should send forth men stamped 
with a seal—ready and able to assist in the regeneration of culture and 
learning, not only in Virginia, but throughout the entire South. 
At first an attempt was made to drop the long-established academical 
titles, save that of M. D., and to adopt the simple title of graduate U. 
V., the name of the school or schools in which the student had been 
“declared eminent” being expressed in his “certificate,” which was to 
be “attested” by the particular professor. This is certainly the most 
striking—probably the only instance of a lack of “ sweetness and light” 
on the part of the founders of the University; but it gives one pleas- 
ure to see how quickly they recognized their mistake and how prompt

they were in correcting it. In 1828 the visitors recommended the 
faculty ‘to consider and report to the board whether some change be 
not proper in the regulations concerning degrees.” The faculty, after 
consideration, reported in favor of that title which has since been re- 
garded in the South as the highest academical honor a man can wear, 
the title of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. For this 
degree, which was adopted in 1831, graduation was required in the 
schools of ancient languages, mathematics, natural philosophy, chem- 
istry (which seems to have taken the place of the old school of natural 
history), and moral philosophy. But the visitors, in adopting the 
degree, showed their wisdom further by recommending the faculty 
“to consider and report whether higher or other degrees ought not 
to be provided for, and whether proficiency in the modern languages, 
or any of them, should be essential to such degrees.” This last rec- 
ommendation would suffice to show us that the visitors were no or- 
dinary men. A glance at the catalogue discloses the names of James 
Madison (Monroe’s term expired in February, 1831, and he died just 
about the time this resolution was passed), of Joseph C. Cabell, of 
Chapman Johnson, of John H. Cocke, and of Thomas Jefferson Ran- 
dolph.. The faculty did not report on this, at least there is no record 
of their having done so; but in 1832 the visitors added “ graduation 
in at least two of the languages taught in the school of modern lan- 
guages” to the requisites for the master’s degree. Since that date 
other changes have been made in the M. A., all tending to make it more 
difficult to obtain; but in 1884, owing no doubt to the increased diffi- 
culty of graduation in the several schools, graduation in the depart- 
ment of historical science ceased to be a requisite. This is one of the 
few backward steps the visitors have taken. To send out a master of 
arts who may be—and I think is, as a rule—comparatively ignorant 
both of history and of political economy, is hardly in keeping with the 
traditions of the University—is certainly not in keeping with the ideas 
entertained by Mr. Jefferson. The degrees subsequently added present 
points both for favorable and for unfavorable criticism. In the year 
1840 the law school was permitted to give its full graduates the title of 
bachelor of law. This was a decidedly advantageous step. In 1848 
the degree of bachelor of arts was authorized, but the requisites at- 
tached to it were such that it can scarcely be regarded as having 
served any definite purpose. <A reference to the catalogues of the Uni- 
versity will readily show the truth of the latter statement. The degree 
was generally, and with good reason, looked upon as a sop thrown to 
those who had failed to become masters; and it was entirely too diffi- 
cult of attainment to answer the purpose which it serves in a curricu- 
lum college.! Changes have recently been made with this last end in 
view, and the success of the innovation is to be hoped for. Since 1848   
11t must be stated here that the master’s and the bachelor’s degrees have no neces- 
sary connection with one another.  
-P-A-G-E-185
  
INFLUENCE UPON SOUTHERN LIFE AND THOUGHT. 155 
nine additional degrees have been authorized by the visitors, viz.: Bach- 
elor of letters, bachelor of science, bachelor of philosophy, bachelor of 
scientific agriculture (shades of medieval Oxford defend us!), civil 
engineer, mining engineer, doctor of letters, doctor of science, and 
doctor of philosophy. The three last-mentioned degrees are post-grad- 
uate, and denote a departure from established custom pregnant with 
interest to the future of the University. Whether the first four degrees 
enumerated serve any very good purpose is, I conceive, an open ques- 
tion. It is necessary to add that no honorary degrees are ever con- 
ferred by the University; a rule originating, 1 doubt not, in the deter- 
mination before alluded to, of providing the South with an institution 
whose degrees should be sure evidence of high merit. 
We have thus seen the truth of the statement that the faculty and 
visitors have never been content with present standards, but havealways 
aimed at higher things. We have found points to criticise, itis true, 
but such as do not affect the general conclusion. Now, it is at once 
plain that this striving after better results, being, as it were, part of the 
mental and moral atmosphere of the place, could not fail to affect the 
minds and characters of many of the students. It is impossible to fully 
trace the effects of this spirit of enterprise and thorough-goingness; it 
will be sufficient to remark that from 1830 the cause of secondary edu- 
cation in the South began to revive, and that this revival was largely, 
if not entirely, due to the graduates of the new institution who went 
forth as teachers. Another result of this constant improvement in 
method and scope of instruction is found in the fact that there is 
scarcely any college in the South which has not to a greater or less 
extent modelled its system of teaching after that of the University ;1 and 
in the further fact that the University has always furnished these vari- 
ous colleges with a large proportion of their professors.2 But I have 
already dwelt too long upon this matter; the remaining heads can, 
however, be more summarily dealt with.   
1 Mr, S..W. Powell, in an article entitled ‘‘ Schools in Dixie,” which appeared in the 
Independent for August 18, 1887, gives the number of these colleges as thirty-five. 
He also adds a statement which is perfectly true: ‘A scholarly Northern man, who 
has taught many years in the South, told me that when he met a graduate of this insti- 
tution (University of Virginia) he generally could count on finding him a man of 
exact knowledge and opposed to all shams.” I may mention here that a member of 
our historical seminary at the Johns Hopkins, who is also an alumnus of Vanderbilt 
University, told me that at the latter institution it is a common thing to hear men 
say, “Oh, if we can just get our standard up to that of the Virginia University we 
shall be all right.” Such praise from a progressive university like Vanderbilt is 
very gratifying, and shows that rivalry grows there like a flower and not like a weed. 
2JIn reviewing my work, I find it necessary to call attention to the fact that the 
University is leading in the South along new lines of education as well as along the 
old. Since Professor Mallet began to teach industrial chemistry in 1868, the Univer- 
sity has sent out over a dozen professors of chemistry, all of whom have their own 
laboratories. The great success of the Miller Manual Training School has been largely 
due to the fact that all the principal teachers, and nearly all the subordinate ones, 
have been University men; and the best school of the kind in Maryland has been 
since its foundation in the hands of an alumnus of the University.

SUBSTITUTION OF ELECTIVE FOR CURRICULAR SYSTEM. 
To enter into a discussion of the respective merits of the elective and 
curricular systems, though logically not out of place here, would scarcely 
harmonize with the promise just made. I can dwell on only one point 
of advantage which the elective system offers, naturally the one which 
in my opinion has most increased the influence of the University upon 
the South, viz., the fact that under the elective system poor men who 
desire to become proficient in one study can come to the University at a 
moderate expense, and in one year by hard work fit themselves as 
thoroughly in ‘that special study as they can under the ordinary col- 
lege system in three or four years. It is easy to see what a powerful 
lever this has been for raising the poorer classes throughout the South; 
nor is the beneficial reaction upon the wealthier classes less apparent 
or important. When we come to the statistical part of our work, we 
shall see that the above reasoning is in no sense fanciful. 
HONOR SYSTEM OF DISCIPLINE. 
I shall be equally brief with regard to the third cause mentioned, viz., 
the confidence reposed in the students in allowing them to exercise col- 
lege discipline by means of the honor system, To argue at length as 
to the merits of this system would be'superfluous. College spies are as 
odious as those of government, and have not as much excuse for their 
existence. All the best principles of paternalism have been present at 
the University, but the worst principles have been banished since its 
foundation. The history of the institution itself furnishes the best com- 
mentary upon the workings of the honor system. Only one instance is 
recorded of any serious insubordination, and the cure for that insubor- 
dination was found in an appeal to the honor of the guilty parties. The 
effects of such' training are not doubtful. Self-reliance, love of truth, 
jealousy for the good name of all with whom one is intimately con- 
nected—these are qualities which were inculcated in every student, and 
which went to form that type of Southern manhood which has had so 
many noble exemplars.'   
1 With regard to the honor system as extended to examinations, it may be interest- 
ing to note that sucha thing as cheating is almost unheard-of, although the fullest 
freedom is allowed to the students during the hours set for the examination. The 
few instances that occur of a student’s taking unfair advantage of this confidence re- 
posed in him furnish further proofs of the excellent results of the honor system; for 
it is the students who practically expel the culprit, the faculty’s power of expulsion 
being rarely exercised, An interesting letter upon this subject, addressed to the Hon. 
N. H. R. Dawson, Commissioner of Education, by John T, Harris, Jr., of Harrison- 
burg, Va., now lies before me. I cannot do better than quote his closing sentence; 
“Tt [the principle of relying upon a student’s honor during examinations] is now a 
part of the life of the institution, and there are none of her alumni who do not remem- 
ber with feelings of intense satisfaction that the honors of their alma mater are all 
the more worth the wearing, because they are not only testimonials of mental at- 
tainments, but evidence as well the fact of their having been fairly and honorably 
obtained.”
-P-A-G-E-187
  
-INFLUENCE UPON SOUTHERN LIFE AND THOUGHT. ibe 
BALANCE HELD BETWEEN THE SECIS AND PARTIES. 
The fourth cause of the University’s influence was stated to be the 
even balance held between sect and sect, party and party. Somewhat 
before the foundation of Mr. Jefferson’s ideal college a reaction had set 
in against the religious indifference of the preceding generation. The 
history of the colonial church in Virginia is not a bright one, and after 
the Kevolution the gloom deepens. French thought seems to have 
played an important part in strengthening the general opposition to 
religion; but that opposition had long been at work in the form of in- 
difference—a form which, though it may be called weak from a philo- 
sophical stand-point, is in its effects upon the lower classes of society 
most subtle and dangerous. It is a mistake to suppose that the gentry 
alone were irreligious; the clergy and the common people were equally 
so. Here and there a man like Devereux Jarratt would succeed in 
arousing some religious enthusiasm; but one has only to read his let- 
ters of 1794 and 1795 to see the truth of the statements made above. 
Indeed, he gives as his reason for writing his life that he must be do- 
ing something, for, work as he would, his clerical duties left him 
ample time for bitter reflection. It is not my intention to describe the 
manner in which the revival was conducted. By 1825 its effects were 
very manifest. That Mr. Jefferson was foolish enough to believe that 
he could establish, in the face of this reaction (to say nothing of the 
total inutility of the project), a university to be conducted on atheistical 
principles, I, at least, can never be brought to believe. That such a re- 
port was long current is true ; but in view of the statistics I am about to 
present, I cannot think that it did the University any great harm. The 
opinion that the new institution was to be a seminary for atheists has 
left its evil fruits, as everything that is false must do; but it is a com- 
fort to think that the holders of the opinion gathered the crop. It has 
not even yet wholly died out; but sensible people are at last becoming a 
little ashamed to express it—a proof of the truth of the assertion I am 
about to make, that this principle of holding an even balance between the 
sects (and the same is true to a less degree of parties) has liberalized 
Southern thought to a most gratifying extent. If any of my readers 
are opposed to such liberalizing influences, the argument may as well 
be dropped here; to those who appreciate the necessity of such influ- 
ences, any further discussion of the point will seem superfluous. 
  
1 For an account of the condition of the early church in Virginia, see Henshaw’s Me- 
moir of Bishop Moore, Chapter IV (Philadelphia, 1843); see also Bishop Meade’s Old 
Churches, etc., Article I; but the best souree of all is the “Life of the Reverend 
Devereux Jarratt, Rector of Bath Parish, Dinwiddie County, Virginia, written by 
Himself, in a series of letters addressed to the Rev. John Coleman,” etc. Baltimore: 
printed by Warner & Hanna, 1806. This book, in addition to its historical value, 
is as interesting as a novel. But for certain obvious considerations one might imagine 
Defoe had written it.

HIGH QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PROFESSORS. 
In considering the fifth cause mentioned, viz., the high qualifications, 
both mental and moral, of the men chosen as instructors, I shall en- 
deavor to avoid prolixity; but, when one is describing character, details 
are often invaluable, and I may have to employ them, even at the risk 
of some impatience on the part of my reader. It can hardly be doubted 
that the influence of a few fine teachers upon their scholars will be felt 
over almost the whole territory from which those scholars are drawn. 
Indeed, this will be readily admitted in the case of men of genius; such 
names as that of Coleridge, or, if a teacher in the professional sense of 
the word must be chosen, of Dr. Arnold, will at once recur to every 
mind. Nor must the proposition be essentially modified when we speak 
of men below the rank of genius; probably the influence they exert 
will not be so great, but even this is by no means certain. It remains 
. then for me to show as briefly as I can that the faculty of the University 
of Virginia has been composed of men whose influence has been great 
and for the good. Toavoid the iuvidiousness inherent in such an under- 
taking, is by no means an easy task; but the attempt must be made. 
I need hardly state that I do not intend to refer here to any professor 
who is still living. 
Mr. Jefferson, determined that his pet institution should not start 
handicapped, had to look to Europe for a majority of the first faculty. 
“Only the two professorships of law and moral philosophy,” says Prot. 
Schele De Vere, “ Mr. Jefferson, with his usual tact and intuitive just- 
ness of perception, determined to bestow at all hazards upon uatives, 
as the subjects here to be taught ought to be national in the highest 
sense of the word. He even suggested that the text-books to be used 
by the professor of law should be prescribed, so that ‘ orthodox political 
principles’ might be taught and ‘the vestal flame of republicanism’ be 
kept alive.” This last is not exactly what we should have expected 
from a statesman so far ahead of his age. Possibly he was not serious. 
Certain it is that, had his suggestion been adopted, the Andover con- 
troversy would have had its parallel in politics. The two native pro- 
tessors were George Tucker in the chair of moral philosophy, and John 
Tayloe Lomax in the chair of law. We shall speak of these before turn- 
ing our attention to the distinguished foreigners whom Mr. Jefferson 
invited over to Virginia. 
GEORGE TUCKER. 
George Tucker was a native of Bermuda, but was educated at William 
and Mary College, and for the rest of his life was a resident of the 
State of Virginia. He engaged at first in the practice of the law, and 
such was his success, that he was chosen a member of Congress in 1819, 
and held his seat until called to the University in 1825. In Congress 
he won deserved recognition as a debater and a constitutional lawyer. 
He had been known as an author before Mr. Jefferson’s choice placed

him at the head of the school of moral philosophy, and during his long 
and useful life he can almost be said to have never laid aside his pen. A 
reference to the list of his works given at the end of this monograph will 
show that Mr. Tucker’s heart must have been in his labors, especially 
in those connected with political economy. Nor must we forget another 
fact connected with his work, viz., that he early recognized the necessity 
of teaching literature and rhetoric systematically, instead of allowing 
his students to pick up a knowledge of them as they could. To this 
end he combined instruction in these departments with his own special 
work in philosophy; a not illogical combination, and a most advanta- 
geous one to young men who must be presumed to have had little gen- 
eral education. As might have been expected, he did not include polit- 
ical economy in this grouping, but gave special lectures upon this 
subject, as Mr. Jefferson had before advised. On the whole, we are 
justified in concluding that the twenty years of Mr. Tucker’s stay at the - 
University were highly profitable ones, both to himself and to his stu- 
dents. In 1845 he retired to Philadelphia, where he lived quietly but 
not idly; for much of his best literary work was done during this well- 
earned rest. He died in 1861, in Albemarie County, Va. When we 
consider what a condition the country was then in, and when we remem- 
ber that not twenty years before he had written a history of its progress 
and development, we are almost tempted to wish that he had not lived 
so long. 
JOHN TAYLOE LOMAX. 
Of John Tayloe Lomax little need be said, as he only occupied the 
chair of law for four years—1826 to 1830. He was a distinguished law- 
yer in his day, and published two works—a Digest of the Law of Real 
Property, and The Law of Executors and Administrators. This last 
work is still highly prized in Virginia, and perhaps in other States. 
Mr. Lomax, after severing his connection with the University, became 
one of the justices of the General Court. He was succeeded by John 
A. G. Davis, a lawyer of high ability, who published a work on criminal 
law. Indeed, the making of books seems to have characterized the pro- 
fessors in this department. Mr. Davis was followed by Judge H. St. 
George Tucker, who was a son of the still more distinguished St. George 
Tucker, and who had been a member of Congress (1815-19) and presi- 
dent of the Court of Appeals of Virginia. Judge Tucker was the author 
of several legal works of high repute. ¢ 
The foreigners invited over by Mr. Jefferson were five in number: 
George Long, George Blaetterman, LL.D., Thomas Hewett Key, 
Charles Bonnycastle, and Robley Dunglison. Of these we shall speak — 
briefly. 1 
GEORGE: LONG. 
George Long filled the chair of ancient languages from 1825 to 1828. 
He was a master of arts and fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  160 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
on the establishment of the University of London was called home to 
fill the chair of Greek in that institution. Mr. Long’s influence upon 
his fellow teachers and his students was great, notwithstanding his 
short stay; for he fixed the standard of requirement in his classes at a 
higher point than was then known in this country, and he was the in- 
structor and life-long friend of his successor, Gessner Harrison, whose 
immense influence upon the University we shall soon consider at some 
length. To characterize the scholarship of a man so well known would 
be a work of supererogation on my part, if not of impertinence; but I 
can not forbear quoting in this connection the opinion of the man who 
was perhaps the best fitted of all English critics to judge such matters— 
Mr. Matthew Arnold. In his essay on Marcus Aurelius,' speaking of 
Mr. Long’s translation of the Meditations, Mr. Arnold. said: ‘ Mr. 
Long’s reputation as a scholar is a sufficient guarantee of the general 
fidelity and accuracy of his translation: on these matters, besides, I am 
hardly entitled to speak, and my praise is of no value. But that for 
which I and the rest of the unlearned may venture to praise Mr. Long 
is this: that he treats Marcus Aurelius’s writings, as he treats all the 
other remains of Greek and Roman antiquity which he touches, not as a 
dead and dry matter of learning, but as documents with a side of mod- 
ern applicability and living interest, and valuable mainly so far as this 
side in them can be made clear; that as in his notes on Plutarch’s Ro- 
man Lives he deals with the modern epoch of Czsar and Cicero, not as 
food for school-boys, but as food for men, and men engaged in the cur- 
rent of contemporary life and action, so in his remarks and essays on ~ 
Marcus Aurelius, he treats this truly modern striver and thinker, not as 
a classical dictionary hero, vut as a present source from which to draw 
‘example of life, and instruction of manners.’ Why may not a son of 
Dr. Arnold say, what might naturally here be said by any other critic, 
that in this lively and fruitful way of considering the men and affairs 
of ancient Greece and Rome, Mr. Long resembles Dr. Arnold ?” 
8 GEORGE BLAETTERMAN. 
I regret that 1 have not been able to obtain more facts of importance 
with regard to Dr. George Blaetterman. He was a German by birth, 
but was residing in London at the time Mr. Jefferson selected him to 
teach the modern languages. Dr. Adams has already laid sufficient 
stress upon Mr. Jetferson’s wonderful anticipation of modern educa- 
tional ideas, so I need only remind the reader that the University of 
Virginia was the first college in this country which taught these lan- 
guages as carefully as it did the classical, and which included among 
them the Anglo-Saxon. Dr. Gessner Harrison bears testimony to Dr. 
Blaetterman’s abilities in the following words: “He gave proof of ex- 
tensive acquirements, and of a mind of uncommon natural vigor and 
penetration. In connection more especially with the lessons on German

  oe an eee re Ul sh ee 
INFLUENCE UPON SOUTHERN LIFE AND THOUGHT.” 161 
and Anglo-Saxon, he gave to his students much that was interesting 
and valuable in comparative philology also, a subject in which he found 
peculiar pleasure.”! Dr. Blaetterman occupied his chair until 1840. 
THOMAS HEWETT KEY.” 
The first professor of mathematics was Thomas Hewett Key, a mas- 
ter of arts of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a few years older 
than Long, and spent two or three years after getting his degree in 
studying medicine. The climate of Virginia did not suit him, so he re- 
turned to England in 1827, and in the following year was elected pro- 
fessor of Latin in the University of London, thus again becoming a col- 
league of Mr. Long’s. About 1840 he gave up the chair of Latin, and 
became professor of comparative grammar and head-master of the pre- 
paratory school connected with the University. He died in November, 
1875. Mr. Key’s reputation as a philologist has been assured by the 
publication of many valuable works, of which a partial list will be 
found at the end of this monograph.   CHARLES BONNYCASTLE. 
Charles Bonnycastle was first invited to teach natural philosophy, but 
on the removal of Mr. Key to England the department of mathematics 
was assigned to him, Robert M. Patterson, of Philadelphia, afterwards 
sub-director of the United States Mint, succeeding him in the chair of 
natural philosophy. Mr. Bonnycastle was educated at the Royal Mili- 
tary Academy of Woolwich, where his father was a professor. This 
Mr. John Bonnycastle was a noted mathematician in his day, and the 
University got the benefit of much of his experience through his son, 
who seems to have had a decided influence upon its methods of instruc- 
tion. From a letter from Chairman Venable, the present professor of 
mathematics, I gather that the examinations set by Mr. Bonnycastle 
were “years ahead of any mathematical instruction given to any college 
classes in the United States.” Heintroduced the use of the ratio method 
of the trigonometrical functions, first used in the English universities in 
1830. This is but one of the many facts which show how thoroughly 
the University of Virginia kept abreast with the times—in many in- 
stances almost even with the institutions of Europe—far ahead of those 
in this country. Mr. Bonnyecastle held his chair until 1840. He was 
succeeded by J. J. Sylvester, who was followed by Edward Courtenay, 
a graduate of West Point and a mathematician of high standing. A 
treatise on the integral calculus, which Mr. Courtenay left at his death, 
was published for the benefit of his family, and was used as a text-book 
at the University for many years. Only within the last three or four 
years has a more suitable book been found for the class. :

162 ° JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
DR. ROBLEY DUNGLISON.! 
The name of Dr. Robley Dunglison is so familiar to all who have 
dipped into medical literature, even to those whose attention is not 
directed further than to the backs of the books, that I need hardly dwell 
upon it here. Dr. Dunglison was born at Keswick, England, in 1798. 
He was educated at Erlangen, in Germany, and came to this country 
at Mr. Jefferson’s request in 1825. He remained eight years at the Uni- 
versity, and left a deep impression upon the minds of all who knew him. 
In 1833 he became a professor in the University of Maryland, and was 
afterwards called to Jefferson College, Philadelphia. He died in this 
latter city in 1869. Dr. Dunglison, in addition to his vast professional 
aequirements, was a man of scholarly feelings and of general culture. 
His contributions to medical science were valuable and extensive. Next 
to Mr. Long, he was probably the most widely distinguished man con- 
nected with the early faculty.” 
It may be well to note here that the medical school was at first estab- 
lished to give culture and training in medical science to the general stu- 
dent, rather than to furnish thorough professional training to the would- 
be practitioner. But this idea was, in some respects, too much ahead of 
the times, and in some not sufficiently in keeping with the requirements 
of the position the new college had taken upon itself to fill, so in 1827, 
as we have already seen, the school was re-organized as follows: Rob- 
ley Dunglison, M. D., professor of physiology, theory and practice of 
medicine, obstetrics, and medical jurisprudence; John P. Emmet, 
M. D., professor of chemistry and materia medica ; Thomas Johnson, 
M. D., demonstrator of anatomy and surgery. 5; 
Certainly, if the date be borne in mind, no one can complain of the 
narrowness of this scheme of studies. 
DR. JOHN P. EMMET. 
John P. Emmet, M. D., who first taught chemistry and natural history, 
was a nephew of the famous Ivish patriot, and was born in Dublin in 1797. 
11 have before me a copy of Dunglison’s$1uman Physiology, 3d edition, Philadel- 
phia, 1838. I am informed by high medical authority that this work has a most im- 
portant position in the history of American medical science. The first edition was 
published before the author had left the University, and was designed as a text-book 
for his students. It was dedicated to ex-President Madison, whom Dr. Dunglison had 
known while the former was rector of the board of visitors. Foreign and native 
scientific journals were loud in their praise of it, and it is still interesting even to the 
general reader, who is at once struck by the author’s acquaintance, not only with 
German contributions to science, but also with general literature, 
? The facts presented in the preceding sketches are mainly derived from a compari- 
son of the accounts to be found in various encyclopedias, and from an article on the 
University of Virginia, by Dr. Gessner Harrison, in Duyckinck’s Cyclopedia of Ameri- 
can Liferature, II, 725. A memoir of Dr. Dunglison was published by his son, 
Dr. R. J. Dunglison, in 1870. For the early years of the University the preface to 
Dr. Schele De Vere’s catalogue, and an address delivered by the late Professor Tut" 
wiler, of Alabama, before the alumni in 1882, may be consulted.  
-P-A-G-E-193
  INFLUENCE UPON SOUTHERN LIFE AND THOUGHT. 163 
His father having emigrated to New York, young Emmet was sent to 
West Point; then he got a year of travel abroad, and finally was gradu- 
ated a doctor of medicine from the College.of Physicians and Surgeons 
of New York. Dr. Emmet was highly qualified for the position he occu- 
pied, and was for a long time a contributor to scientific journals. His 
disposition was genial and winning, and we shall not be wrong in at- 
tributing to him many of those fine endowments which are not to be 
gained from the study of books, but which are eminently necessary to 
the teacher who would animate and encourage as well as instruct. 
DR. GESSNER HARRISON. 
We now come to the man who of all others had, as far as I am able to 
see, the greatestinfluence upon the University, and, through his students, 
upon Southern life and thought; I refer to Dr. Gessner Harrison. 
Whatever may be the value of memorial literature for the historical 
student, it too often belongs to the “ no-book” class of literature which 
excited—I can not say the ire—perhaps I had better say the pity of 
Charles Lamb; but the memorial address of Dr. John A. Broadus upon 
Gessner Harrison is certainly worth reading, apart from its interest to 
the friend or special student. The subject of the address was bornin 1809, 
and was one of the first students entered at the new University. At the 
beginning of his career he intended to make a physician of himself, but 
he devoted much attention to the study of the ancient languages under Mr. 
Long. In 1828 he was one of the three graduates in Greek and also one 
of the three in medicine, these being the first men regularly graduated 
by the University. But he was not destined to be a physician. Mr. 
Long had been recalled to England and had been asked to name his suc- 
cessor. ‘To the surprise of all he named Gessner Harrison, then barely 
twenty-one. The visitors, with many misgivings wemay imagine, gave 
him the appointment for one year; the next year they made it perma- 
nent. Ofcourse such a thing could not happen now except in the case 
of a second Mill. The study of Sanskrit and of comparative philology 
has so widened the field of investigation that no man of twenty-one 
would now be qualified to undertake the teaching of one of the classical 
languages in a college of high standing, much less of both. But the 
case was very different in 1828. The philosophy of language was to all 
intents and purposes unknown, and the ignorance of a few facts more 
or less as to syntax would hardly make against a teacher’s general effi- 
ciency. That it was a highly responsible position can not, however, be 
denied; that the young man filled it nobly is equally patent to the stu- 
dent of his life. 
We may pass over the troubles of the youthful professor, although 
they were serious enough, owing to the bad state of secondary educa-   
! The best source of information with regard to Gessner Harrison seems to be a 
memorial address delivered before the alumni by Dr. John A. Broadus, published as a 
pamphlet, also in the Southern Review, Vol. XIII, p. 334 (1873), and in his Sermons 
and Addresses (Baltimore, 1887), I have drawn largely upon this in the following 
sketch.

tion and to the lawlessness of a few of the students. It is sufficient to 
say that in the opinion of many who from a long life and distinguished 
position have had opportunities for judging, Gessner Harrison achieved 
a remarkable triumph over his difficulties, and that without invidious- 
ness he may be said to have done more than any one man, with the 
single exception of Mr. Jefferson, in raising the standard of education 
throughout the South. From 1828 to 1859 he labored zealously and 
successfully ; then, worn-out and fearing that he could not make a proper 
provision for his large family, he resigned his professorship and opened 
a classical boarding school. Attracted by his reputation, pupils came 
from all parts of the South. But the War broke out and Gessner Har- 
rison did not survive it. From nursing a son who had sickened with 
camp-fever, he contracted a modification of the disease and died on 
the 7th of April, 1862. A more fitting end to his career could not have 
been wished : he lived for others, he died for another. 
A few words as to his methods of teaching, andI shall hasten on to 
the consideration of our sixth and last cause. He laid great stress on 
the necessity for a thorough knowledge of history and geography in 
studying the classics; and as text-books. were wanting he prepared a 
pamphlet to meet the needs of his students. Says Dr. Broadus: 
“In history he seized at the outset upon the ideas of Niebuhr, and 
even in the first half of his career made a great impression upon, at least, 
a few minds, though greatly hindered by the lack of a text-book. In 
the latter half he was cheered and assisted by the appearance of Ar- 
nolé@’s Rome and of Grote’s Greece, followed by manuals not ill-suited 
to the wants of his class. There was then in the University no profes- 
sor of history in general, and many remember as an epoch in their lives 
the views of history and enthusiasm for its study which they derived 
from Dr. Harrison.” 
With regard to comparative philology the labors of Gessner Harrison 
deserve more attention than I could give them in this article, even were 
I qualified to pass judgment upon them; but a few words must be said 
on the subject. Mr. Long sent his successor copies of the earlier por- 
tions of Bopp’s Comparative Grammar, the first part of which appeared 
in 1833. Dr. Harrison seized upon these, and began independent work 
in the application of the new methods to the ancient languages. Nat- 
urally his students came in for a share of the benefits derived from this 
study, and Dr. Broadus gives an amusing account of how the profes. 
sor’s enthusiasm was received by some of them. ‘Old Gess’s humbug- 
gery” seems quite a fit expression for the modern sophomore. This 
application of the German methods was long after unknown in any 
other American college ; it was still unpracticed in the English univer- 
sities, and had not met with general recognition even in Germany itself. 
When Dr. Gildersleeve entered the faculty of the University, he found, 
to use Dr. Broadus’s words, “ that his colleague, Dr. Harrison, had long 
been making free use of comparative philology at a time when in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-195

leading universities of Germany it was scarcely at all applied to the ex- 
planation of Latin and Greek, and that he himself could profit by the 
views found in Dr. Harrison’s Latin Grammar.” 
Besides a sketch of the University in Dayckinck’s Cyvlopadia of 
American Literature, Dr. Harrison published a Latin Grammar, and a’ 
Treatise on the Greek Prepositions and the Cases of Nouns with Which 
They are Used. Of the value of these last I am not able to speak per- 
sonally ; for various reasons they were not adapted to popular use, and 
the predominance. of German works on the subjects they treated may 
account for their not having taken a higher stand with advanced philo- 
logians. Dr. Broadus mentions that Bishop Ellicott, the distinguished 
English commentator, spoke very favorably of the“ Greek Prepositions.” 
About 1870, according to the same authority, an American student 
showed the Latin grammar to Curtius at Leipsic. On returning it the 
great scholar said: “This is a good book, an excellent book for the time 
at which it appeared, though of course we have got a good way beyond 
it by this time.” ‘‘ Had Curtius known,” continues Dr. Broadus, “that 
nearly all of the etymological portion, to which alone his attention was 
directed, had appeared in the earlier volume which Dr. Harrison printed 
for his class in 1839, only six years after Bopp’s first part was published, 
and at least six years before Curtius himself made his first publication, 
he would doubtless have used still stronger language.” 
Such was the character and work of this extraordinary man. AlI- 
though more attention has been given to him than to any other of his 
fellow-workers, I can not think that attention disproportionate. It ne- 
cessitates, however, my passing over the names of others upon whom 
I would willingly dwell. I should love to write of William B. Rogers, 
so well known for his devotion to science, and dear to Massachusetts 
as the first president of her Institute of Technology.1 Then there are 
-other names that come to ‘mind: Socrates Maupin, William H. Me- 
Guffey, Stephen O. Southall, John Staige Davis. All these did their work 
nobly and faithfully, and shall they not be mentioned? But a line 
must be drawn somewhere, and I draw it with my humble tribute to 
one whose loss the University has had recently to deplore. I refer to 
that highly gifted man, Dr. John H. Wheeler, a graduate of Harvard 
and Bonn, a pupil of Professor Gildersleeve, and the successor of Dr. 
Price as professor of Greek in the University of Virginia. He was one 
of the very few of whom it may be said that outside and inside the 
teacher you found the whole-souled man. 
UNIQUE POSITION OF THE UNIVERSITY IN THE SOUTH. 
The sixth and last cause mentioned is also a resultant of the five causes 
previously enumerated. But the unique position of the University with 
regard to Southern education was also due to the absence of statesmen 
of Mr. Jefferson’s calibre, to the inability ina large measure of the other 
1A memorial of William B. Rogers by William Cabell Rives was published at Cam- 
bridge, Mass., in 1883.

' 
Southern States to shake off the trammels of sectarian prejudice, and 
to the condition of secondary education which made it practically need: 
less that each State should havea separate university of high standing. 
That of Virginia for a long time sufficed for the whole South; and the 
wideness of the field from which it drew its students is a partial explan- 
ation of the wide-reaching character of the influence it exerted. I now 
pass to the statistical portion of my inquiry. 
I.—Sraristies. 
The following tables have been prepared with great pains, and it is 
hoped that they are comparatively free from errors. In dealing with 
over nine thousand names and nearly one hundred thousand facts, 
some small errors may have crept into my calculations, but from the 
nature of the work these will be found on the side of underestimation. 
I have still further guarded against the possibility of any mistakes in 
favor of the University by giving round numbers and percentages in 
the first two tables, always striking off the extra units and decimals. 
The third table could not be treated in this way; but I think it is toall, 
intents correct. In this connection I shouid state that the source from 
which I have mainly derived my information is the semi-centennial 
catalogue of the University, compiled by Prof. Schele De Vere and | 
Capt. Joseph Van Holt Nash, and published in Baltimore in 1878. 
This is a very valuable work, and a treasure to the alumnus who has 
not forgotten his alma mater. Its preparation cost immense labor, but 
its editors have already had their reward in the thanks of all well 
wishers to the University. Speaking of the memory of an alumnus, re- 
minds me of a curious psychological fact mentioned in the preface to 
the catalogue, that not a few letters were received written by men who 
claimed to have won honors at the University and to be warmly attached 
to it, but who were found never to have been entered on the record. I 
have been through this catalogue, from A to Z, and have discovered 
very few errors. Some mistakes with reference to the degrees conferred 
I was enabled to correct by means of a valuable little pamphlet issued 
by the university authorities in 1880, entitled ‘A Sketch of the His- 
tory of the University,” ete.

1The fact that the percentages in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and twelfth

counted twice; e. g., clergymen who conducted schools in addition to their clerical work.

EXPLANATORY REMARKS ON THE TABLES, 
The tables in which my statistics are presented almost explain them- 
selves. A few explanatory remarks may not, however, be amiss. I 
shall then proceed to give such additional facts as are worthy of note, 
but oes could not well be put into a table, and shall conclude by 
drawing such inferences as are in keeping with my subject and my fig- 
ures and which have not been introduced in other places. These infer-
-P-A-G-E-199
  
INFLUENCE UPON SOUTHERN LIFE AND THOUGHT. 169 
ences, if their truth be admitted, together with the results obtained by 
our analysis of the werkings of the University, will abundantly suffice 
to prove the truth of my thesis—that the influence of the University of 
Virginia upon Southern life and thought has been highly beneficial. 
The figures presented in all three’ tables are true for the period of 
time between March, 1825, and July, 1874. The first table gives statis- 
tics for the whole body of students; but it must be, carefully borne in 
mind, when attention is directed to particular percentages, that over 
21 per cent. of the men enrolled as students have left no record 
behind them, and that of many who are not entered under the head of 
“unknown,” our information is extremely slight and often misleading. 
It must further be borne in mind that of the 9,160 students who attended. 
the University during these years, 8,505 (I am speaking in round num- 
bers, of course), or over 92 per cent., were from the South; and further, 
that of the 1,485 men who left their native States to settle elsewhere, 
over half settled in the South, so that the University’s field of influence 
has been emphatically Southern, although Maryland and Missouri have 
felt that influence strongly. Itis especially interesting to note the 
fact that many of the students from the North and West were tempted 
to remain in the South, and that not a few of these immigrants took sides 
with the Confedcracy—a fact which, whatever else may be thought of it, 
certainly testifies to the strength of the attachment which the Univer- 
sity has always been enabled to elicit from its students. 
With reference to the omissions in the work, it is but just to say that 
they are not due to any carelessness on the part of the compilers of the 
catalogue, but rather to the indifference of individual alumni or of their 
relatives and friends. 4 
Under the head “In Confederate service” are included not only 
active soldiers, but all surgeons, chaplains, or others who took any part 
in the labors or perils occasioned by the War. The significance of the 
last five heads will be explained further on. 
In Table II the same general statistics are given for each of the South- 
ern and allied States, the language of percentage being employed only 
to avoid cumbrousness. For convenience the District of Columbia has 
been grouped with Maryland, and West Virginia with Virginia. The 
justness of the latter grouping will be obvious when it is remembered 
that for three-fourths of the time to which these figures apply, the two 
States were united. 
In Table III particular statistics of interest have been brought to- 
gether and referred to the individual States. It must be borne in mind, 
however, that the name of the State simply indicates the place of birth; 
it does not mean that the office was held within that State, for, as a mat- 
ter of fact, many of those who emigrated rose to high positions in the 
State of their adoption.

  ADDITIONAL FACTS OF INTEREST. 
We ls come to what may be termed the gleanings from .my first 
harvest. The statistician, as well as the poet, should have sufficient 
patience and self-control to review his work. 
Of the 1,935 lawyers, over 8 per cent. became judges, many of whom 
rose to the highest courts of their respective States. The number of 
commonwealth’s and district attorneys is very large; but few seem to 
have been elected to the office of attorney-general. For this last fact I 
have been unable to find any satisfactory reason, unless it be that the 
office is not a lucrative one for a successful practitioner; but this reason 
applies also to the judgeships of many of our States. The proportion of 
degree men (bachelors of law) to the whole number of lawyers is nearly 
25 to 100. The lawyers have, as might have been expected, proved very 
prominent in politics. Some of them have written law treatises of value, 
for example, Daniel on Negotiable Instruments. 
With regard to the physicians, I quote some interesting facts from an 
address recently delivered at the University by Dr. Paul B. Barringer, 
a graduate of 76. ‘The record shows that from 1827, when the medi- 
cal school was established, until 1880 there were over 3,000 matriculates 
and 616 graduates. Of these, 43 are now, or have been, professors and 
teachers in medical colleges. Notwithstanding the high standard ex- 
acted by the Army and Navy, 60 graduates of this school have been 
professionally in their service. From 1880 to 1885, 38 of the 180 grad- 
nates gained entrance into the Army and Navy ; 16 of the 57 passed- 
assistant naval surgeons were University of Virginia men, while in the 
Army the number was 14.” A comparison of these figures will show a 
decidedly increasing tendency to engage in the service of the Govern- 
ment (the proportion is about 9 to 20), a significant fact, if we are allowed 
the presumption that the standard of requirement for service in the 
Army and Navy has increased pari passu with that for graduation at 
the University. If the increase has been in favor of the Army and Navy 
service the fact is still more significant. 
ALUMNI IN THE WAR. 
In considering the part played by the University alumni in the late 
War, many interesting points are brought to our notice. In the first 
place, the number of generals and brigadiers is very large; I should 
have wearied of the task of counting the colonels, the majors, and the 
' eaptains. Chairman Venable writes me that with regard to the ord- 
nance department, so many University men got in by examination that 
a certain number of appointments had to be assigned to each State to 
avoid dissatisfaction. A large proportion of the engineers employed 
in the service were University men, as were most of the staff officers of 
rank, Perhaps more than three hundred alumni fell. If attention be 
turned to the legislative and executive departments of the Confeder-
-P-A-G-E-201
INFLUENCE UPON SOUTHERN LIFE AND THOUGHT, 141 
ate Government, the statistics are equally striking. In the cabinet 
we find Robert Toombs and R. M. T. Hunter, Secretaries of State ; 
George Wythe Randolph and James A. Seddon, Secretaries of War; 
and Thomas H. Watts, of Alabama, Attorney-General. In the Con- 
gress we count thirty-one alumni, many of whom were senators. 
The number of authors, etc., is surprisingly small, although I was very 
liberal in including the producers of the “no book” class. I shall dis- 
cuss this fact in a more appropriate place, and need only mention here 
the names of Edgar Allan Poe and John R. Thompson, and, for recent 
years, of Virginius Dabney and Thomas Nelson Page. After all, how 
many of our hundreds of American colleges can boast the name of 
even one man of great literary genius? It may not be amiss to notice 
here that Dr. Kane, the great Arctic explorer, was an alumnus of the 
University, as were also Capt. J. Melville Gilliss, astronomer and super- 
intendent of the U. S. Naval Observatory, and Rear Admiral John 
Rodgers, who served with such bravery during the late War. 
CLERGY AND TEACHERS. 
If regard be had to the clergy, the statistics would not seem to prove 
that the University has served as a nursery for atheists. Three per 
cent. in the money market is considered alow rate; but that 3 per cent, 
of the alumni of a non-sectarian institution should, in the land of the 
dollar, turn aside into this laborious and often poorly paid field is a 
fact, to say the least, somewhat remarkable. Of those who entered the 
ministry, five have become bishops, viz, Bishops Lay, Galleher, Peter- 
kin, Dudley, and Doggett. My information on this point is not ex- 
haustive, however, and I am inclined to think that the number may be 
greater. To the various theological seminaries the University has 
furnished such men as John A. Broadus, R. lL. Dabney, F. S. Sampson, 
of Virginia, Charles A. Briggs, of New York, and William H. Whitsitt, 
of South Carolina. Prof. Crawford H. Toy, of Harvard University, may 
be mentioned as one of the most distinguished of the masters of arts. 
A large number of the alumni have entered on missionary work; in- 
deed, Colonel Venable says: “‘ Wipe out the foreign missionaries of the 
Southern Presbyterian Church who are University men, and you almost 
destroy the enterprise.” 
In estimating the number of teachers I have not counted those who 
only taught for a year or two preparatory to entering one of the other 
professions. These men have unquestionably done much in helping to 
raise the standard of instruction throughout the South, and if they be 
added to the number given in the first table, we may safely say that 
over one thousand of the University alumni have been engaged in the - 
good work of education. It would seem well to acknowledge individual 
merit here as always; but I must again disclaim any invidious inten- 
tions. My information is by no means full, nor have I too much space 
at my disposal. I think I shall be safe, however, in calling to mind the

noble work done in Alabama by the late Professor Tutwiler. He was 
one of the first graduates of the University, and was the room-mate of 
Gessner Harrison. I am informed by competent authority that his 
labors for secondary education in Alabama were as successful as they 
were great; and I regret that this meagre notice is all that I can give 
to this great pioneer of educational reform. 
The work of Dr. Thomas R. Price at Randolph-Macon College, at 
the University of Virginia, and now at Columbia College, New York, 
may be cited as a further illustration of what the University has done 
in behalf of education. Dr. Woodrow Wilson, of Bryn Mawr, will 
long be known as the author of Congressional Government, but proba- 
bly Princeton and the Johns Hopkins will dispute our claims to him. 
Among Anglo-Saxon scholars the names of Prof. James M. Garnett 
and of Prof. James A. Harrison stand deservedly high, and the latter 
is equally well known for successful literary work. To the Virginian 
the names of McCabe, Norwood, McGuire, Blackford, and Abbott, and 
to the North Carolinian that of Bingham, will at once suggest the noble 
efforts that are being made to-day in the cause of secondary education. 
It is a noteworthy fact, if the zeal of the University for obtaining the 
services of first-class scholars be borne in mind, that of the nineteen pro- 
fessors now composing its faculty, twelve are its own alumni, and that 
of fifty-five full professors since 1826, twenty have been alumni. 
ALUMNI IN POLITICS. | 
Turning to politics, we find that the number of those who have served 
in the State legislatures is quite large, the percentage with respect to 
the whole number of: students being about three and eight-tenths. 
The number of mayors is small; perhaps the dirty political work so 
often necessary for obtaining the office has deterred alumni from aspir- 
ing toit. The number of consuls and secretaries of legation is also 
small, but is easily accounted for by the same reason which may be 
given for the comparative absence of University men from the higher 
executive and diplomatic positions. The men who graduated between 
1830 and 1840, and who might have stood forward prominently in na- 
tional politics, were fighting against the Government at the very time 
when they would have been qualified by age and experience for positions 
in the cabinet and abroad. For some time after the War statesmen from 
the South were not greatly in demand. 
The two alumni who sat in cabinets were both Virginians—the late 
William Ballard Preston, Secretary of the Navy under the Taylor ad- 
ministration, and Alexander H. H. Stuart, Secretary of the Interior un- 
der Millard Fillmore. There have been two Speakers of the House: R. 
M. T. Hunter, Speaker for the Twenty-sixth Congress (1839-41), and 
James L. Orr, of South Carolina, Speaker for the Thirty-fifth Congress 
(1857-59): Mr. Orr was also the only minister plenipotentiary furnished 
by the University during the first fifty years of its existence. He was

made minister to Russia by President Grant in 1873, but died shortly 
after his arrival at St. Petersburg. Mr. Orr was also one of the com- 
missioners sent to Washington in 1860 by South Carolina. He was a 
Confederate Senator, and the provisional Governor of his State. 
Since the election of Mr. Cleveland the University alumni from the 
South have come more and more to the front. Of the ministerial ap- 
pointees, Hubbard, Tree, Keiley, Winchester, Lewis, and Maury are all 
University men. : In the consular service we find the names of Withers, 
Cardwell, Wingfield, Old, and others. The number of Congressmen 
furnished by the University is, in my opinion, a large one. Since the 
period covered by the tables (1825-74) the figures have been greatly 
increased. Colonél Venable calculates that there were thirteen alumni 
in the last Congress, a greater number than was furnished by any other 
college. Of these I may mention Tucker, Daniel, and Barbour, of Vir- 
ginia; Herbert, of Alabama; and Davidson, of Florida. Of the govern- 
ors we may name Swann and Ligon, of Marylatd; Watts and Lewis, 
of Alabama; and Stevenson, of Kentucky. To these the name of F. W. 
M. Holliday, of Virginia, may be added. 
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS. 
A few words now as to the general conclusions to be drawn from these 
statistics. In the first place, let me again call attention to the fact 
that the University’s influence has been distinctly Southern. Let it 
next be considered what a leavening force one really educated man is. 
Then let it be remembered that before the advent of the modern news- 
paper and the railroad, a large part of the population of the South de- 
pended upon the hustings for their instruction, and that the lawyers 
trained by the University of Virginia furnished much of that instruction. 
If these facts are lost sight of, I am afraid that my statistics and any 
conclusions I can draw from them will be of little value. 
Waiving all subtleties as to the distinction between productive and 
unproductive labor, we may safely assert that the influence of such a 
body of alumni distributed through all the channels of intellectual labor 
must have been enormous. Those who went to the bar carried with 
them, in addition to thorough professional knowledge, a sense of honor 
highly developed by the system of discipline to which our praise has 
been already given; those who went to the pulpit had chosen without 
constraint of any kind their life of self-sacrifice, and were ready to abide 
by their choice; and those who gave themselves up to the education 
of the young had already learned, in their own persons, the value of 
thorough-going work and systematic training. Many who were landed 
proprietors went back to their estates to introduce new methods of ag- 
riculture, to represent their counties in their respective legislatures, to 
set an example of upright living to those beneath them, and to affect 
the society of their equals in that subtle way which can be better un- 
derstood than described. Not a few left their homes and carried to the

still unsettled West the brains and hands that were needed for its de- 
eet Many entered business at home, to apply to all the affairs 
of mercantile life those habits of perseverance and calm study of details 
and that strict spirit of integrity which had been fostered by their uni- 
versity life. A cursory glance at the catalogue will show that they 
succeeded, ‘Bank president”, “president of railroad”, “treasurer”, 
and ‘“‘cashier”, are words frequently seen on its pages. 
But I promised to explain the significance of the last five heads of the 
first table. We see that over one-half of the students spent only one 
year atthe University. This means, as I showed before, that these men 
were enabled to get, not as much education as they needed, but enough 
to fit them either to practise law, or to teach some special branch, or to 
pursue their studies without further assistance. Of course it is not 
claimed that all of these five thousand men made the most of their ad- 
vantages, but they had them offered, and no other college could do 
the like. The large number of two-year men shows an appreciation on 
the part of the students of the work that was being done for them. 
The fifteen hundred who remained three, four, and five years mean at 
least a thousand finely educated men; and what a force was here! 
As was to be expected, the influence of the University has been larg 
est upon Virginia; but we must, in this connection, take into account 
the fact that over five hundred and fifty alumni went from Virginia to 
settle in the other Southern States. Virginia of course received contri- 
butions from her sister States, but not in any considerable numbers. 
| THE UNIVERSITY AND SOUTHERN LITERATURE. 
The excess of the physicians over the lawyers would afford an oppor- 
tunity for interesting but rather fine-spun reasoning, if I were to forget 
the impatience of my readers; but I have no such intention, and shall 
only dwell briefly on one more point,—the paucity of authors among the 
alumni. I should hardly have been tempted to notice this fact, but for 
the consideration that it might cause doubt in some minds as to the 
extent I have claimed for the University’s influence, especially upon 
Southern thought. I do not think that the University can be blamed 
because her sons have not been foremost in strictly literary work—for 
where is the literature of the South? The truth seems to be that the 
University must have instilled a love of literature into the minds of 
many ofits students, but that counter-forces were at work which checked 
or diverted the faculty of literary expression for the whole South. A 
diversion of this faculty is seen in the oratory, bad as it too often was, 
of the hustings andof the court-room. The causes of the repression are 
far to seek. It will not suffice to lay the charge to slavery. That much 
enduring institution, to whatever extent it may haveretarded the South’s 
industrial development, did not degrade society, nor could it well have 
checked the growth of a Southern literature: Old Greece had her arts 
and letters in spite of slave labor. We must go deeper if we expect to

find a solution of the Southern problem. From a study of colonial lit- 
erature we must endeavor to ascertain how and in what manner a 
change of environment affects the literary capabilities of a race. Our 
conclusions may be exceedingly general and imperfect, but I can see 
no other way worthy of a serious student; and, even after such consci- 
entious study, our results are sure to be worthless, unless we carry with 
us in our investigations that true literary touchstone which so few 
possess. How amusing, then, are many of the grave opinions we every 
day hear advanced with regard to the South’s backwardness in literary 
production! The fact is there, the true explanation of it will long be 
wanting. There are indications, however, that the season of our bar- 
renness is over and that the spring is at hand. If premature praise, 
like a March wind, do not blight this promise, we may confidently ex- 
pect that the University of Virginia will play an important part in that 
literary development for which we are all watching and praying—many 
of us as if there were something almost criminal in our not having had 
a literature before. © 
CONCLUDING REMARKS. 
And now my work is over, but I part from it with reluctance. The 
words “influence,” “ alumnus,” “University,” which the reader is as 
tired of seeing as I am of trying to find substitutes for them, will occur 
nomore. In this respect I can not even take comfort from the example of 
the great reiterator, for Matthew Arnold might reiterate till doomsday 
and still be charming. I have also tried not to assume the attitude of 
a special pleader (I use the phrase, of course, in its objectionable sense), 
but it would be too much to hope that I have always succeeded. The 
labor I have given to the preparation of my statistics has been very 
tedious, but it has been occasionally lightened in unexpected ways. For 
instance, it was highly interesting to watch the careers of the “rolling 
stones” from the University, many of whom, after trying three or more 
professions, finally wound up as “ forty-niners” in California. One got 
into Garibaldi’s service; one was made chief medical inspector of the 
Egyptian army ; one started from Virginia, was a member of the Texas 
Congress, then treasurer of Texas, then got a diplomatic appointment 
abroad, and finally settled down as a farmerin Maryland. One student 
from Peru became a professor of law in the University of Lima, was 
afterwards Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and then represented his gov- 
ernment in China and Japan. But perhaps the entry which gave me 
most food for reflection was the following: “ Nathaniel Holt Clanton, 
of Augusta, Ga.; born 1847; student, Paris, France; pressed into serv. 
ice of Commune, and killed on barricades, 1872.” 
In conclusion, it may be permitted a loving son to apply to his college 
mother a verse from a great old poet, whom he learned to love within 
her walls— 
“Ts she not worthy of gaining golden honor?”!

CHAPTER XII. 
PRESENT ORGANIZATION AND CONDITION OF THE UNI. 
VERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
By PRoFressor JouHn B. Minor. 
The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and 
methods of instruction were virtually left to be prescribed by Mr. Jef- 
ferson alone; and they still retain, in a great degree, the impression 
derived from him, and in many respects bear the stamp of his charac- 
teristic traits. : 
ORGANIZATION, 
The supreme government of the institution, under the General Assem- 
bly, is vested in a rector and visitors, appointed by the Governor, by 
and with the consent of the Senate, for four years. They are nine in 
number, three being selected from the Piedmont division of the State, 
in which the University is situated, and two from each of the other grand 
divisions. The visitors elect a rector from amongst themselves, and 
the style of the corporation is declared to be “ The Rector and Visitors 
of the University of Virginia.” They are required to meet at the Uni- 
versity at least once a year, and as much oftener as circumstances re- 
quire ; and to submit to the General Assembly an annual report setting 
forth the condition and progress of the institution. 
The board of visitors, thus constituted, is declared by law to be 
charged with the care and preservation of the property belonging to 
the University ; with the appointment of as many professors as it shall 
deem proper; with the power to prescribe the duties of each professor, 
and the course and mode of instruction; and, with the assent of two- 
thirds of the whole number of the visitors, may remove any professor. 
It is also empowered to appoint a bursar and proctor, and to employ 
any other agents or servants, to regulate the government and discipline 
of the students, and generally, in respect to the government and man- 
agement of the University, to make such regulations as it may deem 
expedient, not being contrary to law. 
Under the general direction of this board, and subject to its regula- 
tions, the affairs of the institution are administered immediately by the 
faculty and its chairman. The faculty, as a body, exercises the judicial 
176
-P-A-G-E-207
  PRESENT ORGANIZATION AND CONDITION. LG 
functions incident to the administration of the University, in respect to 
students and tho subord inate officers, and is empowered also to make 
general rules for the government of those persons, provided, of course, 
they shall be consistent with the regulations prescribed by the board of 
visitors, and with the laws of the State. The chairman is sclected an- 
nually, by the board of visitors, from among the professors, and dis- 
charges most of the functions usually devolved upon a president, being 
for the time the chief executive of the University. To this republican 
feature of rotation in the office of chairman, Mr. Jefferson attached not 
alittle importance. The system is not without its disadvantages, but 
its benefits decidedly preponderate. The chairman doesnot monopolize 
the administration, as a president would do, but each professor, feeling 
that he is a constituent element of the governing body, with his proper 
share of influence in shaping its destiny and fortunes, is animated at 
once by a sense of duty, of responsibility, and of ambition to devote his 
utmost powers of thought, care, and assiduous effort to augmentits use- 
fulness and prosperity. 
The professors were at first paid in part by salaries ($1,000 a year 
each), and in part also by fees of tuition received from each student 
who might attend them severally, thus, as Mr. Jefferson conceived, pre- 
senting to each at once the most natural and the strongest motive to 
exert himself with all the strenuousness he could command to promote 
in all ways the efficiency, and consequently the success, of the institu- 
tion. But circumstances, in the opinion of the board of visitors, and of 
most of the professors, were judged to require a departure from this 
plan, and for some years past each professor has been paid a salary of 
$3,000 per annum, which, together with an official residence, or a money 
equivalent therefor, constitutes his sole emolument. 
SCHOOLS OF INSTRUCTION. 
The scheme of instruction contemplates no fixed and uniform curricu- 
lum of study to be pursued by every student alike without discrimina- 
tion; but each distinct branch of knowledge is assigned to a separate 
“school” by itself, with its own instructors; and in these several schools, 
which are exclusively under the control of the instructors therein (sub- 
ject only to the board of visitors), a separate degree is conferred, de- 
nominating the recipient a “ graduate” in that school, and in a few cases 
earrying with it a title, as of doctor of medicine, bachelor of law, civil en- 
gineer, mining engineer, or bachelor of scientific agriculture. The Uni- 
versity may, therefore, be fairly regarded as a collection of schools, each 
devoted to a special subject, but under a common government. 
This plan gives ample scope to the just ambition of each professor, 
and affords a strong stimulus to each to advance the standard of attain- 
ment in his school, in point as well of accuracy as of extent, whilst it 
' holds him, besides, to an undivided responsibility for any neglect or de- 
fault. It admits also, and contemplates, an indefinite multiplication of 
17036—No. 2——12

  178 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
“schools,” so as to keep pace with the progress of knowledge and the 
demands of society. 
Dr. Dunglison, afterwards so distinguished in the medical world as 
an author, was expected to teach anatomy and medicine merely as a 
branch of liberal education. But in 1827 the school was enlarged to a 
department, organized as follows: Robley Dunglison, M. D., professor 
' of physiology, theory and practice of medicine, obstetrics, and medical 
jurisprudence; John P. Emmet, M. D., professor of chemistry and ma- 
teria medica; Thomas Johnson, M. D., demonstrator of anatomy and 
surgery. 
Two other schools have since been added to this department; so that 
its organization at present embraces: (1) A school of the theory and 
practice of medicine, obstetrics, and medical jurisprudence ; (2) a school 
of physiology and surgery; (3) a school of chemistry and pharmacy ; 
(4) a school of anatomy, materia medica, and therapeutics; and (5) a 
demonstratorship of anatomy. 
In 1851 the school of law was converted into a department, by the 
creation of an adjunct professorship, which, in 1854, was made a full 
professorship; so that thenceforward in the department of law there 
were, and are, two schools, namely, (1) the school of common and stat- 
ute law and (2) the school of constitutional andinternational law, equity, 
evidence, and the law-merchant. 
In 1856 the school of ancient languages was divided into two schools, 
namely, (1) the school of Latin, and (2) the school of Greek and of 
Hebrew. 
In the same year was also established the school of history and gen- 
eral literature, which, however, did not go into operation until the 1st of 
October, 1857. 
In 1867 the school of applied mathematics, with reference especially 
to engineering, was created as an adjunct to the school of mathematics, 
and has since (in 1869) been constituted an independent school. 
In the same year was instituted, as an adjunct to the school of chem- 
istry, the school of technology and agricultural science, a designation 
soon after changed to that of analytical, industrial, and agricultural 
chemistry. 
In 1870, by means of a munificent endowment of $100,000, derived 
from the liberality of Samuel Miller, Esq., of the county of Campbell, 
the school of scientific, experimental, and practical agriculture was 
created; since, with some change of subjects, denominated the school 
of agriculture, zodlogy, and botany. 
In 1882, by the extraordinary liberality of Leander J. McCormick, Usq., 
a native of Virginia buta citizen of Chicago, of William H. Vanderbilt, 
Esq., of New York, and of a number of other friends of learning and of 
the University, the means were provided to maintain, and there was in- 
stituted, the school of practical astronomy, in connection with the Lean- 
der McCormick Observatory.

  PRESENT ORGANIZATION AND CONDITION. 179 
In 1879 Mr. W. W. Corcoran added to his previous noble benefactions 
to the University the gift of $50,000, wherewith to endow a school of 
natural history and geology, which was instituted accordingly. 
In 1882 was established the school of the English language and liter- 
ature, which necessitated a change in the subjects taught in the school 
of history and literature, and it was enacted that that school should 
thenceforward be known as the school of historical science. 
Thus it appears that since 1867 the University, maimed and enfeebled 
as it seemed to have been by the Civil War and its consequences, has 
added six schools of great value to the thirteen previously existing, and 
so is enabled to supply the largest and most thorough instruction that 
the advanced requirements of the country and the times can demand. 
At present the University consists of nineteen schools, with one or more 
instructors in each; of these schools, twelve are academic and seven 
professional; and of the twelve academic schools, six are literary and 
six scientific. Thus arranged, they may be enumerated as follows:

ment. 
Students attend as many of the schools as they think fit, paying a tu. 
ition fee for each; but in order to insure that every student shall have 
his time sufficiently occupied, no one can attend less than three, without 
leave from the faculty. In this feature is seen Mr, Jefferson’s character- 
istic confidence in the capacity of individuals to determine, each for him- 
self, what is best for him. He thought it safe to submit to the judgment 
of each student and his friends, the choice of subjects best adapted to 
the cast of his mind and to his views in life. The system is certainly 
liable to some grave objections, but it is specially adapted to a univer- 
sity as distinguished from a colJege, and the results have upon the whole 
proved eminently favorable. Custom recommends a general order or

succession of studies, which experience has approved ; but if one, from 
peculiar circumstances, is led to prefer a different course, he is free to 
pursue it. One of the chief advantages, however, is found in the effect 
on the several schools, in stimulating the professors having them in 
charge to unceasing progress. And it may be observed that of late 
many institutions of the higher education in the United States have 
remodelled their methods in accordance with this example. 
SCHOLARSHIPS. 
It is only within a recent period that scholarships have existed in the 
University. The design in instituting them is to encourage sound and 
advanced learning by assisting the poor to attain to it, and by stimulat- 
ing those to attempt it to whom such pecuniary aid is not indispensable 
and yet welcome. Such expedients have been resorted to ever since 
the revival of learning in the twelfth century, and led to the establish- 
ment, throughout western Europe, of great institutions of education. 
The colleges in the English universities were devised to this end, and 
were, indeed, simply endowed boarding-houses, with a provision for the 
“fellows,” who were admitted to share their beneficence which, in pro- 
cess of time, by the enhancement in value of the lands bestowed upon 
them, has become, in modern times, extremely munificent. 
At present there are in the University four classes of scholarships, 
namely: (1) University scholarships, (2) free scholarships, (3) Miller 
scholarships, and (4) alumni scholarships. 
(1) University scholarships are supplied by the University itself. They 
are eleven in number, and entitle the successful candidates at a com- 
petitive examination to prosecute the studies of one session at the Uni- 
versity without the payment of matriculation or tuition fees, and are 
open to new-comers from all the States at the beginning of each aca- 
demic year, which at present is October Ist. ; 
_ Of these eleven scholarships five are in the academic department, and 
two, severally, in the departments of medicine, of law, and of engineer- 
ing. The examination is uniform for all, and embraces Latin, Greek, 
mathematics, and English. In order to secure positive attainments, the 
right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach the standard re- 
quired for a distinction at the final examination in junior Latin, junior 
Greek, and junior mathematics, and do not show a competent acquaint- 
ance with the grammatical and rhetorical structure of the English lan- 
guage. 
(2) Free scholarships.—The board of visitors in 1882 founded three 
free scholarships, to be called, respectively, the Corcoran scholarship, 
the McCormick scholarship, and the Vanderbilt scholarship, in com- 
memoration of three of the principal benefactors of the University, the 
appointments to be made by them respectively, or, if they decline, by 
the faculty. Each scholarship admits the beneficiary to the University 
in all the departments, professional as well as academic, free from the 
payment of matriculation and tuition fees.

PRESENT ORGANIZATION AND CONDITION. 181 
(3) Miller scholarships—The agricultural department having been 
founded upon the liberal benefaction of Samuel Miller, three scholar- 
ships have been instituted in that department, and named from the 
founder, Miller scholarships. The emolument belonging to each is 
$333.334, and they are bestowed upon such as upon competitive exam- 
inations appear to be the most worthy. 
(4) Alumni scholarships.—These scholarships are founded, some by 
the Society of Alumni, and some by individuals. The emolument at- 
tached to them is various, and the appointments to them rest with the 
persons who founded them, or with the executive committee of the 
Society of Alumni. 
DURATION OF THE SESSION AND OF THE VACATION. 
The session extends from the 1st day of October to the Wednesday 
before the 4th day of July, with no break or holiday during that period 
(Sundays of course excepted), save only one day at Christmas. There 
is no remission of college exercises even on Saturday, the school-boy’s 
immemorial weekly holiday. The number of working days in the session 
is therefore about two hundred and thirty-two, which exceeds, it is be- 
lieved, the number of working days in any collegiate institution in the 
world. 
The vacation is of about three months’ duration, extending from the 
Wednesday before the 4th of July to the Ist of October. 
THE LOCAL ARRANGEMENT AND EQUIPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
According to its original design, the University buildings were dis- 
posed in four parallel ranges, which, it seems, it was contemplated should 
be extended indefinitely in both directions, as occasion might require, 
although the configuration of the ground seems hardly adapted to such 
ascheme. Their present length is about 600 feet each. 
The eastern and western ranges look, respectively, towards the east 
and west, and front upon a broad street, which makes the circuitrof the 
University. They consist of one-story dormitories for students, with 
an arcade running along the front, of some 12 feet in width, the outer 
wall of which consists of a series of arches, exhibiting a not unpleas- 
ing effect, reminding one of the cloisters of a monastery. This long 
. range of low structures is broken by wide alleys, giving access to the 
two interior ranges, and is relieved further by dwellings which rear 
their roofs somewhat higher than the dormitories, and were originally 
meant to serve as hotels or boarding-houses for the accommodation of 
the students, to which use two of them, much enlarged, are still ap- 
plied, whilst one is the residence of a professor, another of the proctor, 
and two others are society halls. 
The two interior ranges front upon a grassy lawn, shaded by trees, 
and about 200 feet wide. They also consist of one-story dormitories for 
students, broken by the above-mentioned alleys communicating with the 
east and west ranges respectively, and agreeably relieved by five houses
-P-A-G-E-214
  182 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
in each range, the dwellings of as many professors, the fronts of which 
display considerable regard to architectural effect. In the front of the 
dormitories and of the professors’ houses is a continuous colonnade of 
about 12 feet in width, taking the place of the arcade of the east and 
west ranges, the arches being replaced by handsome columns, which 
support a roof, nearly flat, over the paved walk below, the whole sur- 
mounted by an iron balustrade, and affording a communication in the 
upper story between the professors’ houses on each side. 
At the northeastern extremity of the two lawn-ranges stands the Ro- 
tunda, a structure modelled nearly after the Pantheon at Rome, about 
70 feet in diameter, and about the same in height to the bottom of the 
dome, which rises about 20 feet above the body of the building. It is 
adorned with a very striking and classical marble portico in front, 
reached by stone steps extending the whole width of the portico, and 
contains on the ground and second floors four handsome elliptically 
shaped lecture-rooms, and on the third floor a circular library-room cov- 
ering the whole area of the building, with two galleries between the 
floor and the dome extending quite around the capacious circle, and 
supported by graceful Corinthian columns. Accommodation is thus af- 
forded for about 42,000 volumes, which is the present extent of the 
library. In the course of a few years, slowly as, with the slender rev+ 
enues of the University, the books increase, it will be necessary to make 
some additional provision for their safe-keeping and accessibility. 
This library hall, itself a remarkably handsome apartment, is graced 
by a statue in marble of Mr. Jefferson, executed by Galt, the Virginia 
artist. It was the gift of the General Assembly, and represents the 
great statesman 1n a costume modelled after that which he was accus- 
tomed to wear, the needful flowing drapery being supplied by a cloak 
flung over the shoulders. The pedestal bears the following inscription, 
which, it will be observed, is that prepared by himself for his tomb:

  PRESENT ORGANIZATION AND CONDITION. 183 
The columns of the hall also are adorned by a number of portraits, 
among which are those of General Robert E. Lee and of Mr. W. W. 
Corcoran, one of the chief benefactors of the institution. 
The buildings thus far described constitute all belonging to the Uni- 
versity at the beginning. But as soon as the Medical School became 
the Medical Department, it was indispensable to provide therefor addi- 
tional lecture-rooms, an anatomical theatre, and a dissecting hall, which 
were accordingly erected opposite the northwestern extremity of the 
west range. 
The need of still additional lecture-room accommodation led, in 1851- 
53, to the erection of a building in rear of the Rotunda, and connected 
with it by a porch, corresponding in architectural design with that in 
front, and terminating towards the northeast in a like porch. This 
building is about 100 feet long by 54 wide, and the connecting and ter- 
minal porches, of about 30 feet each, make the whole additional struct- 
ure extend some 160 feet towards the northeast. The ground and 
second floors of this building,and also the fourth floor, an attic, are 
occupied by lecture-rooms, and rooms for the safe keeping of the 
costly apparatus belonging to the school of natural philosophy; the 
third floor, corresponding with the second in the Rotunda, and imme- 
diately connected therewith, is taken up with the extensive public 
hall, used upon commencement and other similar occasions, capable of 
_ Seating, upon the floor and in the galleries, about twelve hundred 
persons. f 
In this hall, occupying the greater part of one extremity of it, is a 
copy, made by Balze, of Raphael’s famous painting of “The School of 
Athens,” which it may be hoped will be the germ of an art gallery at 
some future day. 
In 1854-55 a comfortable house was erected by general subscription 
for the residence of the chaplain, and a short time afterwards (in 1855- 
56), also by general subscription, a hall for the use of the Temperance 
Association, which has for many years existed amongst the students of 
the University. 
In 1859 the number of students resorting to the University had so 
much increased (being upwards of six hundred), as to make additional 
accommodation needful, and accordingly a row of six buildings, con- 
taining in all about fifty rooms, was constructed to the southwest of 
the University, distant from it about 200 yards, arranged in the arc of 
a circle, which having been built largely from the proceeds of a tract 
of Iand devised to the University by the will of Martin Dawson, Esq., 
received the designation of “ Dawson’s Row.” 
At the close of the Civil War, in 1865, the situation of the University 
seemed well-nigh hopeless. Its buildings required extensive repairs, 
its apparatus needed to be refitted, and its revenues were virtually an- 
nihilated. The institution was much endeared, however, to the General 
Assembly and to the people of Virginia, and as a place of liberal and

thorough education enjoyed the entire confidence of the South and of a 
great part of the West; and the faculty and visitors, addressing them- 
selves energetically and hopefully to the work of rehabilitation, with the 
cordial co-operation of the Legislature, experienced a success so gratify- 
ing as to warrant an enlargement of the corps of professors, and a conse- 
quent addition to the buildings. Thus a small house, once occupied by 
President Monroe, on what from that circumstance has been denomi- 
nated “Monroe Hill,” at the extreme northwestern limit of “* Dawson’s 
Row,” was enlarged and otherwise fitted up so as to make a comfortable 
dwelling for a professor, whilst a new and handsome residence for an- 
other was erected in extension of the same line, and west of West-range, 
together with a chemical laboratory, said to be one of the largest and 
best appointed in the United States. 
In 1875-76, by the munificence of Lewis Brooks, fia a venerable 
and honored citizen of Rochester, N. Y., supplemented, after his decease, 
by the liberality of his brother and nen of Prof. William B. Rogers, “ 
and others, a museum of natural history was erected and equipped in 
the completest manner, so as to afford unsurpassed facilities for illus- 
trating the principles taught by the sciences of zodlogy, botany, min- 
eralogy, and geology. The collections are large and have been selected 
solely with a view to be aids in teaching. This building, which is of a 
style of architecture entirely variant from the previous structures of 
the University, is much admired. It is placed just at the entrance to 
the institution, and has its interior adorned with heads, executed in 
stone, of various animals, and with the names, also in stone, of the great 
naturalists of the world, in all ages, including, on the front, Aristotle, 
Linneus, and Cuvier; on the rear, Pliny, Werner, and Humboldt; on 
the north or right side, Hall, Gray, Audubon, Agassiz, Dana, and Rog- 
ers; and on the south or left side, Lyell, De Candolle, Owen, Darwin, 
St. Hilaire, and Huxley. 
In 1880-81, in response to the generous invitation of Leander J. 
McCormick, Esq., of Chicago, as already mentioned in this sketch, who 
proposed to contribute for the purpose the refracting telescope, complete, 
estimated at $50,000, the enterprise of establishing an astronomical ob- 
servatory in connection with the University was set on foot, and, by 
the singular liberality, as before stated, of William H. Vanderbilt, of 
New York City, and an additional most liberal gift from Mr. McCormick, 
and by the contributions of many other friends of learning, not only 
was an endowment fund created to maintain a professor of astronomy, 
with his assistants, and to defray contingent expenses, but also to erect 
the observatory building, and to put the telescope and other needful 
appliances in position, the University itself providing suitable accommo- 
dations for the professor and his assistants in immediate proximity to 
the observatory. 
These buildings, which are substantial and Slagabts are situated on 
“Observatory Mountain,” or, as it is more recently styled, “ Mount Jef-

ferson,” about a mile southwest of the University, on a spot selected for 
such a structure by Mr. Jefferson himself, and where, indeed, he caused 
to be erected a small building for the purpose of an observatory, but 
which was never used nor even completed, and in 1859 was pulled down, 
and the material composing it applied to other purposes. 
This description of the equipment of the University for its great work 
would be by no means complete without reference to the experimental 
farm, which occupies a considerable portion of the open arable land 
within the University domain. It affords to the students of agriculture 
opportunities for observing, in connection with the scientific exposition 
of the principles of the subject, most of its practical processes, con- 
ducted in the most careful and approved manner, under thesupervision 
of the professor of agriculture, by a skilled, practical farmer; and also 
of noting the structure, character, and working of the best agricultural 
implements and appliances, and of following the progress and methods 
of the experiments always going on under the same intelligent and 
skilled direction. 
Summing up the various equipments which have been mentioned un- 
der this head, they may be enumerated as follows: 
(1) Provision of dwellings and necessary grounds for professors ; 
(2) Abundant provision of lecture-rooms ; 
(3) Sufficiency of lodgings and boarding-houses for students ; 
(4) Costly and continually enlarging apparatas for the school of nat- 
ural philosophy ; 
(5) Costly and remarkably complete anatomical illustrations ; 
(6) A laboratory building containing a well-equipped chemical labora- 
tory, capable of accommodating some seventy students in chemical 
analysis, a very complete chemical apparatus for general chemistry, a 
commodious lecture hall, and a museum of industrial chemistry, the 
valuable illustrative collections in which are hardly equalled in this 
country, and are said not to be surpassed in Europe; 
(7) The Lewis Brooks Museum of natural history and geology, with 
singularly extensive and complete illustrative collections, costing in the 
aggregate, including the building, no less a sum than $86,000; 
(8) The Leander McCormick Observatory, on Mount Jefferson, about 
a mile from the University, but still within its domain, which is fully 
equipped for its work, with the great refracting telescope, the greatest, 
with one or two.exceptions, in the world, and with other suitable ‘in- 
struments and appliances ; and, lastly, 
(9) The experimental farm, under the direction of the professor of 
agriculture, affording to the students of that school ample illustra- 
tions of all manner of farming operations, and of the best agencies 
and implements for conducting them.

Of the foregoing sum of $282,600, permanent and fixed tunds, about 
$2,600 had accrued before the Civil War. The residue of $280,000 has 
been contributed since 1869. And if to this very large sum be added 
the $653,600 mentioned under the preceding head, it appears that since 
1869 the University has received gifts and contributions amounting to 
$891,100! Thus wonderfully realizing, even in a period of general de- 
pression, the anticipation of Mr. Jefferson, that for the promotion of the 
higher education of the people, private munificence would ere long 
richly supplement and eclipse the contributions of the State. 
THE ANNUAL INCOME OF THE UNIVERSITY, 
The annual income of the University arises from sundry sources, some 
of which are variable, depending on the number of students. It 1s in- 
deed no small hinderance to its growth and prosperity that so large a 
proportion of its annual receipts is derived from students, and imposes 
unavoidably a considerable tax on them, instead of coming from fixed 
investments. Some.of the wealthier institutions of the country are en- 
abled to admit pupils at lower rates of expense for tuition and other 
charges, and thus secure the advantage of numbers, although they may 
be possessed of no more educational merit. It may be hoped that ere 
very long the munificence of friends of learning will contribute such ad- 
ditional endowments as will make it possible for the University to lower 
its present necessary charges. 
The revenues of the institution may be stated thus:

  CHAPTER XIII. 
THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIR- 
GINIA! 
By ProFessor J. M. GARNETT. 
[The discussion started in the November number [1885] of the An- 
dover Review by the article of Professor Palmer on “The New Edu- 
cation” will doubtless! be continued by the advocates respectively of 
the curriculum and the elective system of education. The present ar- 
ticle is in no sense polemic, and the system described is not new. This 
elective system has been in operation in the University of Virginia for 
over sixty years. Its working is well known throughout the South 
but it is not so well understood in the North, and discussions of the 
elective system of education have grown out of the adoption of the sys- 
tem, in a somewhat different form, by Harvard University in recent 
years. The writer has thought that a plain and simple description, 
without argument, of the system pursued for so long in a sister univer- 
sity may not be without interest to educators who are seeking to find 
out the best way to attain the objects which we all have in view. The 
success which has attended the University of Virginia, and the prom- 
inence which ‘its alumni have attained in all walks of life, are at least a 
testimony to the suitableness of the system for this particular institu- 
tion. 
This article was prepared, by invitation, for the International Con- 
gress of Educators, which met at New Orleans in February, 1885, dur- 
ing the World’s Exposition, and has already appeared in the proceed- 
ings of that body published by the United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion. It was intended to show the inner workings of the University, 
and as a supplement to a Sketch of the University of Virginia, pre- 
pared by a committee of the faculty as a part of the University exhibit 
in the Exposition, and containing a brief history of the origin of the 
University, an account of its early organization, and the subsequent ad- 
ditions to its subjects and means of instruction, and a particularly full 
account of its local arrangements, endowments, andincome. Such mat- 
ters are, therefore, not described in this article, except in so far as the 
present organization of the University illustrates the working of its 
elective system. The University of Virginia was the first institution in 
the country to adopt this system, and its work has been consistently 
done on the lines originally laid down, the question of changing it for

any other having never even been mooted, as far as the present writer 
is informed.] 
The University of Virginia was first opened for the reception of stu- 
dents on March 7, 1825, so that it may now be said to have completed 
its period of middle life, and to have attained the comparatively vener- 
able age of sixty years. The system with which it started, then alto- 
gether unique in this country, continues|to be the system at the present 
day, notwithstanding the many changes and additions which have since 
taken place. This system was an arrangement of the subjects of in- 
struction taught at that time into eight separate and distinct schools, as 
they are technically termed, namely, ancient languages, modern lan- 
guages, mathematics, natural philosophy, natural history (soon, how- 
ever, limited to chemistry), moral philosophy (including mental pbi- 
losophy), anatomy and medicine combined, and law. These eight 
schools have expanded into nineteen, in some of which, besides the pro- 
fessor, there are assistant instructors ; and of these, twelve are academic 
schools, six being literary, and six sciéntific (though two of the latter 
are attended only by specialists), and seven are professional schools, 
three being in the medical department, two in the law, one in the en- 
gineering, and one in the agricultural.!_ Each of these schools is inde- 
pendent of every other as far as its course and methods of instruction 
are concerned. The professor himself is the sole judge of the special 
subjects which he shall include in his course, and of the manuer in 
which he shall teach those subjects. Within the limits, then, of each 
particular chair there is the greatest freedom allowed in the selection 
of subjects and arrangement of the course. One of the cardinal princi- 
ples of German university organization, Freiheit des Lehrens (freedom 
of teaching), was thus initiated in this country sixty years ago. 
The faculty, as a whole, consisting of the professors at the head of 
each school, is the immediate governing body of the University, and 
controls the number of hours, and even the particular hours, which are 
devoted to instruction in each school; and, subject to the approval of 
the board of visitors, representing the State authority, directs what 
honors shall be awarded in a part, or the whole, of the course taught in 
each school, and what schools, in whole or in part, shall be required for 
  
1 These schools are now designated as follows : 
ACADEMIC SCHOOLS.—Literary department.—Schools of Latin, Greek, modern lan- 
guages, English language and literature, historical science, and moral philosophy 
(six). Scientific department.—Schools of mathematics, natural philosophy, general 
and industrial chemistry, analytical and agricultural chemistry, natural history and 
geology, and practical astronomy (six). 
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS.—Medical department.—Schools of physiology and surgery, 
anatomy and materia medica, medicine, obstetrics and medical jurisprudence, and 
chemistry and pharmacy [same asacademic] (four). Law department.—Schools of com- 
mon and statute law, and of constitutional and international law, mercantile law, evi- 
dence, and equity (two). Engineering department.—School of mathematics applied to 
engineering (one), Agricultural department.—School of agriculture, zodlogy, and 
botany (one), q

the academic and professional degrees of the University. The faculty 
is presided over by a chairman, appointed annually by the board of 
visitors, although in practice the same professor is reappointed as often 
as he is willing to undertake the onerous duties, which no one desires 
to undertake, notwithstanding the additional compensation. Upon the 
chairman devolve all the administrative and executive duties usually 
discharged by the president of a literary institution, but his power is 
more limited, for every question that arises outside of the ordinary rou- 
tine must ms referred to the faculty, and be decided by that body. 
The faculty acts usually through committees, but no decision of a com- 
mittee is final unless approved by the faculty. This feature of the Uni- 
versity system is thought by some to be open to objections, and the more 
common organization, with a president at the head of the institution, is 
considered, in some respects, better; but the plan has been found to work 
well in practice; it is thought to place more responsibility upon the in- 
dividual professor, and it is at least an open question whether a different 
organization would be better for this particular institution. Moreover, 
it was a pet idea of Mr. Jefferson’s, derived, perhaps, from the annual 
election of a rector magnificus in the German universities, and we are 
told in a paper from the pen of Professor Minor, written thirty years 
ago, that ‘Mr. Jefferson attached not a little importance to this repub- 
lican feature of rotation, insomuch that at the very last meeting of the 
board [of visitors] before his death [in 1826] Mr. Wirt, then Attorney- 
General of the United States, having been appointed professor of law 
and president of the University, Mr. Jefferson, while expressing his 
hearty concurrence in Mr. Wirt’s appointment to the chair of law, en- 
tered upon the minutes, with his own hand, so strong a protest against 
the creation of the office of president that, upon Mr. Wirt’s declining, 
the proposition was never renewed.”! But though the rotation existed 
in the early days of the University, no professor having then held the 
office more than two years in succession, this ceased forty years ago, 
and, as already stated, it is customary for the board of visitors to re- 
elect the same professor as often as he is willing to retain the office. 
Another feature of the organization of the faculty deserves notice, and 
that is, that there is no distinction whatever between the professors in 
the academic and in the professional departments. They all meet on 
an equal footing as one body, and questions relating to each depart- 
ment are decided by the whole body. The division of the philosophical 
faculty, which has recently agitated the German universities, has not 
yet been suggested here, even so far as relates to a separation of aca- 
demic and professional schools, but each professor avails himself of 
whatever light may be thrown upon the subject under discussion by 
any one of his colleagues. This tends to prevent narrowness, to avoid 
considering the claims of one school or department separate from the 
rest, and to give force to a decision of the faculty as that of the whole 
body, and not of a fractional part of it.

  192 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
_ The board of visitors has been referred to as the highest authority of 
the University. This board consists of nine members, appointed every 
four years by the Governor of the State, and confirmed by the Senate, 
three from the Piedmont region, in which the University is situated, 
and two from each of the other three grand divisions of the State, the 
Valley, Southwest Virginia, and the Tide-water region. In the hands 
of this board are lodged all powers usually exercised by boards of trus- 
tees, and especially the control of the finances of the University, 
although in respect to these the faculty, at the close of each session, 
through one of its committees, prepares for its annual report a state- 
ment-of estimated receipts and expenditures for the ensuing session, 
with such suggestions as it may think proper in respect to expenditures 
for special purposes, which statement serves as a guide to the board of 
visitors in authorizing the disbursements. This board is required by 
law to make to the Legislature an annual report of the condition of the 
University. The University receives from the State an annual appro- 
priation of $40,000, in return for which it is required to admit, free of 
charge for tuition in the academic schools, all Virginia students sixteen 
years of age who pass an elementary examination for admission into 
the respective schools which they desire to attend, or who present cer- . 
tificates of satisfactory attainments from some college or preparatory 
school. The limit of age has heretofore been eighteen years, but this 
was changed by the Legislature in 1884 of its own motion. 
Having thus briefly sketched the organization of the University as re- 
gards its subjects of instruction and its governing bodies, let us con- 
sider it from the point of view of those for whose benefit the University 
is established, and see how it affects them. A student who enters the 
University is supposed to have arrived at such an age as to know what 
he wishes to study, or to have had directions from his parents to pursue 
certain subjects of study. This is, of course, true with respect to profes- 
sional students, whose average age on entrance is over twenty-one years, 
and itis presumed to be true with respect to academic students. The 
average age of these students on entrance is about nineteen years, so that 
the presumption is reasonable.!| The entering student finds at least ten 
academic schools open for his selection, three of which he is required to 
enter, unless he is of age or has his parents’ authority to enter a less num- 
ber. Sometimes as many as four are entered, in whole or in part; but 
it is seldom advisable for a student, and especially a first-year student, 
to enter more than three. Cases frequently occur where a student has 
taken up more studies than he can attend to, and therefore applies to 
the faculty for permission to drop some one school. If the student isa 
candidate for a titled degree, he will find these schools grouped in ac- 
cordance with the requirements for that degree, but the order in which 
he sball take up the specified schools is left entirely to his own selection. 
The schedule of hours is to some extent a limitation upon his selection,   
1See the table on next page.

THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM. 1935 
as, of course, students can not enter the same year schools of which the 
lecture hours conflict. If the student is not a candidate for a titled de- 
gree, he may select any three schools he pleases; there is absolutely no 
restriction upon his choice but that necessarily imposed by the schedule 
of lecture hours. Thus another principle of German university organ- 
ization was introduced into this country at the inception of the Univer- 
sity of Virginia, sixty years ago, that is, Fretheit des Lernens (freedom 
of learning). As is well known, this is termed the elective system in 
distinction from the curriculum system, and it has been gradually intro- 
duced into many of our higher institutions of learning. But the mis- 
take has been made, as it seems to me, of introducing it into many of 
our lower institutions of learning also. We are told by Prof. Charles 
F. Smith, of Vanderbilt University, in an article on ‘‘Southern Col- 
leges and Schools,” in the Atlantic Monthly for October, 1884 (p. 
548), that “at least thirty-five Southern colleges and universities have 
adopted this system, following the example of the University of Vir- 
ginia.” Iam inclined, however, to agree with the president of Tulane 
University, who is quoted in the above article as saying (p. 551): “It 
is just as demoralizing for a college to invade the domain of true uni- 
versity work as for a preparatory school to attempt to be a college;” 
and again: “While I approve of the ‘elective system? for real univer- 
sities, I regard its application to colleges and schools as a misfortune.”

194 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
The elective system as it prevails in the University of Virginia, which 
has never known any other system, has been often misunderstood. It 
has been sometimes imagined that the University of Virginia confers a 
titled academic degree for any combination of studies that the student 
himself may select, provided that he fulfils the requirements of the 
written examinations. This is, of course, an entire mistake. There is 
attached to each school the degreo of graduate in that school, conferred 
on completion of the entire course taught in that school, which is tested 
by means of rigid written examinations, on which the student is re- 
quired to attain at least three-fourths of the total value of the questions. 
A student who has received this diploma of graduation in Latin, say, is 
entitled to call himself “a graduate of the University of Virginia in . 
Latin;” and so for all other schools. In some schools, where the sub- 
jects are capable of division, the degree of proficient is similarly con- 
ferred on completion of certain specified partial courses in these schools, 
and in a few schools the attainment of two such proficiencies on distinct 
subjects constitutes graduation in the school. These degrees, however, 
are not titled degrees. The requirements for titled degrees are strictly 
specified! In some of these degrees there is no option possible, but 
certain fixed requirements are made, which the student must fulfil if he 
wishes the particular degree; in others option is permitted within very 
narrow limits; and in only one—the recently established degree of bach- 
elor of philosophy—does the option vary to the extent of one-half of 
the academic schools of the University, graduation in five schools, any 
three of thesix literary and any two of the four scientific schools, being re- 
quisite for the attainment of this degree, which is, to my mind, more con- 
sonant with the genius of the elective system and ofa university than any 
other one of the bachelor’s degrees. It will thus be seen that the require- 
ments of the University of Virginia are stricter with respect to subjects 
for the titled degrees than those of many institutions which still retain 
the curriculum system; which fact, combined with the high standard 
requisite for graduation in each school, will account for the small num- 
ber of titled degrees conferred by tho University. In respect to titled 
degrees, there is another point which deserves mention. The B. A. de- 
gree is not preliminary to tho M. A. degree, as in most institutions; it 
is merely a degree conferred for lower attainments. A student may 
attain the M. A. degree without ever having received the B. A. degree, 
or, in certain cases, without ever having studied some of the subjects 
specified for the B. A. degree, as in this last a limited substitution is 
allowed. Again,a student may receive the B. A. degree and never 
attain the M. A. degree, for it is not conferred in course, but only after 
graduation in the specified schools. The two degrees have, then, no 
relation to each other, and, as a matter of fact, the M. A. degree was 
established in 1831, seventeen years before the institution of the B. A. 
degree, the only degree originally instituted being that of graduate in a

school, which may be called the basis of all degrees. Just here I may 
be permitted to correct a slight error into which Prof. OC. F. Smith has 
fallen, in the article above referred to, with reference to the require- 
ments for the M. A. degree in the University of Virginia. There is no 
such “ student public opinion” which “ holds students to a certain order 
of studies” (J. ¢.,p. 549) as that with which the University is credited. 
I presume none would be more surprised than the students themselves 
to hear that such “public opinion” was reported to exist. The illus- 
tration given—namely, that “a student who had taken French and 
Spanish as the two modern languages for his [M. A.] degree found, after 
he had gotten his certificates of proficiency [read, diplomas of gradua- 
tion], that student public opinion regarded no other modern language as 
an equivalent for German for the M. A. degree, and he therefore took 
German in addition,” must have been based on misinformation as to 
the requirements for the M. A. degree. From 1832, when graduation in 
the school of modern languages was first required for the M. A. degree, 
to 1859 the student was at liberty to take any two of the four modern 
languages taught for his M. A. degree. In 1859 the requirement of 
French and German as the two modern languages necessary for this de- 
gree was made obligatory, and has so continued ever since. It is the 
faculty, under approval of the board of visitors, that regulates the re- 
quirements for all degrees at the University of Virginia as at other 
institutions, and no “student public opinion” affects these or con- 
cerns itself in any way with the order of studies that any student 
chooses to pursue. <As already stated, if the student is a candidate 
for a titled degree, he finds the requirements strictly specified; if not, 
he is at liberty to study any subjects he pleases, and the only con- 
cern of the faculty is to see that his time is fully occupied, which is 
sought to be effected by the requirement that he must enter at least 
three schools, unless special circumstances exempt him from it, and 
that, having entered these schools of his own choice, he attends the 
lectures regularly and discharges the duties incumbent upon him. If 
the student is a candidate for any titled degree, he will find, also, that 
no limit of time is specified for its attainment; this depends entirely 
upon his ability to fulfil the requirements. Of nine M. A. graduates 
of 1884, the time of attendance at the University varied from three 
years to six, the usual time being three and four years. The one B. S. 
had attended for two years, and the one B. A. for six years. (I should 
add that the last was a professor’s son, who had entered quite young— 
only fifteen years of age—and had therefore gone very slowly through 
the course.) In like manner graduation in a school is not dependent 
upon the time of attendance. While a student who is well prepared 
may graduate in a particular-school the first year, another may take 
several years to accomplish graduation; and cases have occurred where 
a student has attended the Senior class of the same school for three 
years and still failed to graduate. As there is no annual promotion 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
    196 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
_ from class to class, as in a curriculum, the element of time does not 
enter, and a student may accomplish his course fast or slow, according 
to his inclination and. ability. The same standard is set for all, and it 
must be reached regardless of time. There is also no entrance exami 
nation, except for Virginia students who desire free tuition—and this is 
of a very elementary character in each school—so that no student is 
rejected for lack of preparation. Upon the student himself rests the 
responsibility of undertaking the courses prescribed? In the schools of 
Greek and mathematics there are three classes—Junior, Intermediate, 
and Senior; and in those of Latin, modern languages (that is, in French 
and in German), and natural philoscphy, there are two classes—Junior 
and Senior, and the student enters whichever one, after consultation 
with the professor, he finds himself prepared for; but only those who 
complete the course of the Senior class can apply for graduation in the 
school. 
The class-work during the year, consisting of the preparation of cer- 
tain portions of the text-books, the writing of exercises in the languages, 
and the preparation of the notes taken from the oral lectures of the 
professor, is by no means all of the student’s work. In all the language 
classes certain authors are assigned to be read privately, from which 
reading of the Senior classes one of the pieces for translation in the 
graduation examination is usually taken, the other being taken from 
the classical writers of the language at will. The pieces for translation 
in the graduation examination are never taken from what has been read 
in the class-room. It was formerly customary to leave to the student 
himself the selection of his private, or extra, reading, both pieces for 
translation in the examination being taken from the classical writers of 
the language at will, but now the so-called “ parallel reading” is 
assigned by the professor at the beginning of the session, and the 
student reads it from time to time during the year. In the mathemat- 
ical classes extra problems are assigned for solution each week, or even 
each day, so that the student’s original powcr for this kind of work is 
continually tested. In some other schools a course of parallel reading 
in connection with the subjects studied—or corresponding private work 
in addition to that of the class-room—is assigned, the object being to 
encourage the habit of private study along with the preparation of a cer- 
tain portion of the text-book or a certain quantity of lecture notes from 
day today. The proper preparation of this last also is tested by careful 
questioning at each lecture on the portion of the text-book assigned 
and on the subjects of the preceding lecture. 
The student’s presence at each lecture is ascertained by a regular 
roll-call, and if his absences reach as many as three during the month 
in any one school without valid excuse, his name is reported to the fac- 
ulty, and he is admonished to be more particular in attendance. Also, 
the number of times that he has absented himself from lectures in each _ 
school, and a brief statement as to how he is doing, are entered upon
-P-A-G-E-235
THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM. 197 
the monthly report regularly rendered to his parents. A student who 
is persistently idle and neglectful of admonition,or whose conduct is 
deserving of severe censure, is usually informed at the close of the 
session that his presence during the following session will be dispensed 
with; or, in flagrant cases, his parents are requested to with- 
draw him forthwith. It may be truthfully said that cases: of this 
kind seldom arise, and I do not suppose that any institution in the 
country enjoys greater immunity from bad conduct on the part of its stu- 
dents than the University of Virginia. Every student is treated asa 
gentleman, he respects himself as such, and conducts himself accord-_ 
ingly, and cause for censure very seldom arises. Supposing that the 
student has applied himself to his studies, and maintained a good class- 
standing during the year, which is determined by the regularity of his 
attendance at lectures and by the judgment of the professor as to the 
student’s answers in the class questioning—for there is no marking 
system in vogue in the University—he presents himself for the written 
examinations. These oecur twice during the year, in February and in 
June, and in some schools the two examinations count as of equal value, 
being on different portions of the course, while in others the whole stress 
is laid on the final examinations. The professor endeavors in these ex- 
aminations by aseries of questions, some of which often require lengthy 
answers, to test thoroughly the student’s knowledge. A list of exami- 
nation questions is often very deceptive ; so much depends upon the 
character and extent of the answer required, and even upon the judg- 
ment of the examiner. While the professor in each school sets the ques- 
tions and examines the papers, two other professors along with him 
constitute the committee of examination for that school, and any ques- 
tion that may arise relative to the examination or to the student’s 
papers is decided by the committee and not by the professor alone. 
The examinations for graduation last usually from six to eight hours on 
each subject, though sometimes, in the case of students who write 
slowly, they may extend'to ten hoursor more. They are seldom limited 
to a shorter period than six hours, so that a student is not required to 
write against time; he is given a full opportunity to state what he 
. knows, even if he may think slowly. As already stated, he must attain’ 
three-fourths of the total value of the questions, or he fails of graduation, 
and in the professional schools the standard is higher, being four-fifths 
in the medical department, and five-sixths in the law department. Each 
student appends to his examination paper .a pledge that he has 
“neither given nor received any assistance during the examination,” 
which pledge is most rigidly observed as a point of honor by all the stu- 
dents. Ihavenever known personally of but one violation of this pledge, 
and in that case a committee of his fellow-students waited upon the of- 
fender and informed him that he must leave the University, which he did 
forthwith. Ihave heard that a few similar cases have occurred in the his- 
tory of the University, which were similarly treated. Here it is “stu-  
-P-A-G-E-236
  198 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, 
dent public opinion” that regulates the matter and sets the tone of the 
University. A violation of the examination pledge may not even reach 
the ears of the faculty, but is dealt with by the students themselves. 
It is simply an impossibility for any faculty to regulate this, and it 
must be left to the honor of the students. The University of Virginia 
is not peculiar, however, in this respect, for the same tone and practice 
exist in other institutions in Virginia and the Southern States, and have 
extended to the preparatory schools also. They may, too, exist in in- 
stitutions in the Northern and Western States, but as to this I am no 
so well informed. 
Thus by means of class teaching and private study during the year, and 
rigid written examinations at the close, the University of Virginia en- 
deavors to secure thoroughness of attainment on the part of its students. 
A diploma of graduation in any school is an evidence that the student 
has worked hard on the subjects taught in that school, and has come up 
to the standard required, whether he has spent one, two, or three years 
in obtaining his diploma. A titled degree is evidence that the student 
has accomplished such hard-work in several specified schools, and as 
the M. A. degree requires graduation in more schools than any other, 
it has always been regarded as the highest honor of the University. 
There have been established, however, recently, doctorates of letters, — 
science, and philosophy, which require that a student who has obtained 
the corresponding bachelor’s degree, or, in the case of the last, the de- 
gree of B. A., or of B. Ph., shall pursue post-graduate courses in two 
schools of his own selection out of those in which he has graduated. His 
proficiency in these courses is tested by theses and examinations, and 
while no limit of time is fixed, it is estimated that the completion 
of the post-graduate courses will require at least two years of 
study after attainment of the bachelor’s degree. The candidate’s 
thesis must show independent research in the subject of his selection, 
and, on approval, must be printed. The effort is thus made by means of 
the doctorates to encourage and reward specialization. Tho system has 
been in operation too short a time as yet to produce results, but there 
are now certain students pursuing post-graduate courses who will apply 
for the doctorate in due time.! 
It deserves to be added here that no honorary degree is conferred by 
the University of Virginia. It may be taken for granted that any one 
_ of its graduates who writes a titled degree after his name has worked 
hard for it, and has attained on the written examinations the standard 
requisite for graduation in the several schools specified for that degree. 
In order not to prolong this paper to too great length, it remains to 
notice briefly, in conclusion, the character of the preparation necessary 
  
1 The degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred for the first time in 1885, and it 
was in that year also decided to recognize the B. A. degree from other reputable insti- 
tutions as a preliminary to this doctorate, the requirement, however, of graduation in 
the two selected schools of the University being still maintained.

for academic students to enter the University of Virginia profitably. 
Professional students, of course, being over twenty-one years of age, 
will enter with whatever preparation they may have been able to ac- 
quire, and will profit accordingly. From the average age of entrance of 
the academic students, already stated as about nineteen years, it will 
be seen that they have attained greater maturity of mind than the first- 
year students of many institutions of learning, and their preparation 
should correspond. 
In several schools of the University no previous knowledge of the 
subjects taught is required, and a student may enter these schools 
without further preparation than is implicd by the possession of a good 
common English education, such as the highest grade of public schools 
can supply, for the teaching begins with the elements of the subject, as 
in chemistry, for example, or moral philosophy; but some maturity of 
mind is requisite in order to profit by the courses taught. In judging 
of this preparation, then, it will be necessary to take those subjects 
which the preparatory schools profess to teach, namely, Latin, Greek, 
mathematics, French, and German, if, indeed, these last can be rightly 
added. I wish I could add English also, but as yet the courses in 
English are so meagre and so varied in the preparatory schools that one 
can not, for the large majority of students, count upon more than in- 
struction in the ordinary English grammar, and in the elementary 
principles of composition and rhetoric. There are some important ex- 
ceptions to this statement, but I think that I speak rightly as regards 
the English course taught in the great majority of preparatory schools 
in the South, which is the chief constituency of the University of Vir- 
ginia, and possibly in the North and West; but of these I speak under 
correction. In my judgment the great want in most of our preparatory © 
schools is a thorough course in English parallel with the courses in Latin, 
Greek, and mathematics, and of equal importance. We are not so de- 
ficient in good preparatory schools, at least in Virginia, as one would 
infer from a letter of Prof. W. M. Baskervill,-of Vanderbilt Univer- 
sity, printed in the Nation of December 18, 1884 (No. 1016), in which, 
after enumerating five schools by name—one in North Carolina, one in 
Tennessee, and three in Virginia—he adds: ‘All the rest of the South 
can not add five more such schools to this list.” I would beg leave 
to say that I can easily add from Virginia alone “ five more such 
schools” and over, whose course is equally as high in grade as that of 
those mentioned, and, in fact, a colleague informed me that he could 
count fifteen. But these schools have not yet established full and 
thorough courses in English equal in extent and importance to their 
courses in classics, mathematics, and modern languages, though I look 
hopefully for this to come in time, even if something else must “ go by 
the board.” While our schools are doing good work, and sending up 
some students every year prepared to enter the Senior classes in the Uni- 
versity, they are not now equal in numbers, nor, perhaps, in the grade
-P-A-G-E-238

of their work, to the schools in what was “ the golden age” for Virginia 
preparatory schools, and for the University—the decade from 1850 to 
1860. Then there were at least a half dozen schools in the State whose 
number of boarding pupils varied from sixty to a hundred, and several 
others with a less number, all preparatory to the University, and draw- 
ing their pupils from all parts of the South. The University during this 
period was in its most flourishing condition, having for at least six 
years successively over six hundred students in attendance, nearly four 
hundred of whom were academic students, coming from all of the South- 
ern States from Maryland to Texas. Almost all of these preparatory 
schools either were conducted by graduates, usually M. A.’s of the Uni- 
versity, or drew their principal teachers from it. Having been educated 
in one of these schools and having taught in another, I may be permit- 
ted to speak from personal experience of the preparation afforded, as anil- 
lustration of the school course. In the school attended we had been read- 
ing for three years the higher Latin and Greek authors—others having 
been previously studied—of which I recall, in Latin, Tacitus and Juve- 
nal, Plautus and Terence, Cicero’s Letters, and Tusculan Disputations ;, 
and, in Greek, Euripides, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Theocritus, and we 
had written weekly exercises in Latin and Greek composition, retranslat- 
ing into these languages a piece of English translated from some classi- 
cal author; we had studied trigonometry and surveying, analytical 
and descriptive geometry, and the class succeeding ours studied also 
the differential and integral calculus; we had pursued a French course 
during the three years, reading lastly Racine and Moliére, and writing 
weekly exercises. I do not now recall any English studies pursued, 
except spelling, which was rigidly insisted on for the whole school, and 
composition and declamation; for the time of English was not yet. I 
can not say that all, or even a majority, of the students entering the 
University enjoyed this amount of preparation, but it was not any too 
much for entering the Senior classes in the respective schools, and any 
student who desired to graduate the first year in the schools named 
must have had somewhat equivalent preparation, even if he had not 
read quite as much Latin and Greek. I speak of “Senior classes” and 
of “graduation the first year,” because a student may enter the lower 
classes in the schools of Latin, Greek, mathematics, and modern lan- 
guages with very much less preparation, or he may even enter the 
Senior classes and profit by the instruction given; but he will not grad- 
uate the first year. Comparing the courses taught in these schools of 
the University now with those taught twenty-five years ago, I should 
say that graduation in Latin and mathematics is somewhat more diffi- 
cult now than it was then; in Greek and modern languages it is about 
the same. The preparatory schools have, therefore, now a somewhat 
harder task than’ they had then, and, with some exceptions, it does not 
seem to me that they fulfil it as well, but I may be mistaken. Educa- 
tion in Virginia, if not in the whole South, does not seem to have re-

. covered from the great cataclysm, notwithstanding twenty years have 
elapsed, and a new generation has come on the scene. The University of 
Virginia is certainly now much better equipped for its‘work than ever 
before. Its thirteen schools of 1860 have expanded to nineteen; it pos- 
sesses a chemical laboratory and a museum of natural history and 
geology of extraordinary value; its gifts, endowments, and appropria- 
tions are greater than at any former period; and it has just been pro- 
vided with an endowed observatory, and a refracting telescope equal to 
any in this country-and excelled by few in Europe. That its students — 
are not as numerous as formerly, is due, in my opinion, to two causes— 
the one, perfectly just in itself and not to be regretted but in its effect, 
that other Southern States are building up their own institutions, and 
are educating for themselves the students whom Virginia formerly edu- 
cated for them; in this they are wise, and are to be congratulated, and 
no lover of education would wish to see them take one step backward ; 
the other cause is, I fear, not so creditable to our people as a whole, 
and here I include Virginia, as well as other Southern States; it is, 
that there is not as great a desire for higher education as there once 
was; our people have been occupied with their material interests, and 
have starved their minds; young men are growing up all around us. 
with a mere smattering of education, but as it is sufficient to enable 
them to enter upon an agricultural, manufacturing, mercantile, or com- 
mercial life, they are satisfied; education costs money and postpones 
the time for making money, and we are content to do withoutit. But 
“the three R’s” will uot suffice; the education given in our public 
schools is very desirable as far as it goes, and these schools should, by 
all means, be extended; but, if we are content to stop there, it will not 
answer ;, we can never rear a cultured community on the rudiments of 
learning; we can never take the position we once occupied in the states- 
manship of this great country, nor even hold our own, if our higher 
institutions of learning are neglected. 
The so-called “New South” has developed in many ways, has ex- 
panded prodigiously, from a material point of view, and has extended 
the blessings of elementary education to a much larger number than 
ever before. But I question seriously whether, in proportion to the 
population, there are as many young men now seeking a higher educa- 
tion as there were in 1860.1. Some who write about the condition of 
education in the South previous to 1860 do not know what was the real 
condition of affairs. They do not reflect that the higher institutions 
of learning in each State, and the private schools preparatory to them, 
were generally well attended, and that the character of the liberal 
education supplied by them was in no whit inferior, if it was not supe- 
1 This view is expressed also in two thoughtful and well-written articles on “Edu- 
cation in the South,” which appeared in the Nashville Christian Advocate of Jan- 
uary 24 and 31, 1885, but the anonymous writer is rather pessimistic in regard to 
education not only in the South, but in the whole country.

rior, to what it is now. While we have broadened, we have not deep- 
ened. Lack of private means, doubtless, has had much to do with this, 
but as material interests have progressed, this lack is being gradually 
supplied. The caution which, it seems to me, is now most needed by 
the people of the South is not to let regard for material interests over- 
ride consideration of intellectual growth. Mind must rule, and mind 
must have the opportunity of being developed to its highest capacity 
if we would keep pace with the intellectual progress of the world. 
Our higher institutions of learning must be cherished, not only sup- 
ported from the public funds, but aided by private benefactions, and 
especially sustained by receiving for education the sons of all who can 
afford to send their sons to be educated. With much increased facili- 
ties for instruction, the colleges and universities should not lack stu- 
dents, for whom these facilities are provided. Higher education should 
be at least as highly appreciated now as it was by our fathers, or the 
; result will inevitably be seen in the career of our sons. We can not 
afford to neglect the higher education, for, if we do, it will undoubtedly 
react upon the lower, and we shall stand before the world a half-edu- 
cated people, regardless of our most important interests. Moreover, we 
can never contribute our share to the literature of the world unless we 
lay the foundation broad and deep. Writing novels and works in the 
negro dialect is not contributing to the highest forms of literature. 
Does any of this ephemeral literature, or all of it together, deserve to 
be placed beside the papers which emanated from the statesmen of the 
past, or the speeches with which the halls of legislation once resounded? 
Let us not deceive ourselves. Let us realize that the higher education 
must be maintained, and that we must take advantage of it if we would 
be an educated people; that there isa higher life than the mere material, 
and that making money is not the chief end of man. 
This sketch of the way in which the University of Virginia is en- 
deavoring to do its part towards securing that thoroughness in the higher 
education which is so essential to suecess, is offered as a contribution 
to the general educational work in this country, and especially as a 
plain description of one modest phase of that work.

OF VIRGINIA. 
By THE EDITOR.

The above are the best sources of information concerning the origin of Jeffer- 
son’s educational ideas and his early plans for the development of a uni- 
versity in his native State. Here will be found his correspondence with M. 
Pictet upon the project of transferring the Geneva faculty to Virginia; also 
his letters to M. Dupont de Nemours, Dr. Priestley, Dr. Cooper, and many 
other gentlemen, whose advice Jefferson sought upon educational questions. 
In Jefferson’s complete works will be found his Notes on Virginia, which 
contain valuable historical references to his first plans for transforming 
William and Mary College into a university, and to his original bills for 
the establishment of a system of public education. 
The Writings of George Washington, edited by Jared Sparks. 
These contain the interesting correspondence between Washington and Jefter- 
son respecting the project for a French-Swiss university in Virginia, a proj- 
ect which undoubtedly had great influence upon both of these Virginians 
in shaping their schemes for national and State education.

bibliographical work appearetl, the Bibliotheca Jeffersoniana: A List of Books Written 
by or Relating to Thomas Jefferson, by Hamilton Bullock Tompkins (New York and 
London: G. P, Putnam’s Sons). 350 copies printed. The writer’s purpose in the pres- 
ent Bibliography is educational, and specifically concerns the University of Virginia, 
but he gladly expresses his gratitude to Mr. Tompkins for so comprehensive and com- 
plete a Bibliotheca Jeffersoniana. Such collections of historical material with regard 
to other American statesmen would prove of great service to students and specialists.

  204 JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
The Writings of James Madison. 
The third and fourth volumes of these writings are very important for an under- 
standing of the historical and political significance of the University of 
Virginia. Madison was one of the original board of visitors and one of 
Jefferson’s most valued advisers in the direction of the institution, espe- 
cially in the matter of political education. He and Jefferson agreed upon 
and prescribed text-books upon the science of government. Both men 
wished to keep the University out of the hands of the Federalists. 
Sundry Documents on the Subject of Public Education for the State 
of Virginia. Published by the President and Directors of the Literary 
Fund. Richmond, 1817. 
With this invaluable publication the documentary history of the University of 
Virginia begins. It was the discovery and acquisition of this pamphlet 
of 78 pages in an antiquarian book-store at Baltimore which first led the 
writer to an interest in the educational history of Virginia. The collection 
of ‘Sundry Documents” was issued through the political influence of Ca- 
bell as a means of propaganda for the university idea, which, in the year 
1817, first began to influence the Virginia Legislature. The collection con- 
tains Jefferson’s bill for the more general diffusion of knowledge, proposed 
by the committee of revisers of the laws of Virginia, appointed by the 
General Assembly in the year 1776. This is the historical corner-stone of 
Jefferson’s university. The writer has called particular attention to this bill 
in the preceding monograph. Note also Jefferson’s original bill for amend- 
ing the constitution of William and Mary College, which was to be the roof 
and crown of a system of populareducation. The next great land-mark in 
the history of the University of Virginia is Jefferson’s letter to Peter Carr, 
September 7, 1814. It represents a complete break from the idea of trans- 
forming William and Mary College into a State university, and takes a 
fresh departure in the proposed development of Albemarle Academy into a 
college or university. This letter, which contains Jefferson’s educational 
platform, was published by Cabell in the Richmond Enquirer, and marks 
the first introduction of the new idea into the public mind. Then follow 
all the legislative documents, such as the report of the president and direc- 
tors of the literary fund to the General Assembly in December, 1816, a re- 
port which marks the entrance of Jefferson’s educational ideas into poli- 
tics. The correspondence between Governor Nicholas and the leading 
educators of the country upon a system of public education for Virginia, 
and also Mercer’s bill ‘for the establishment of primary schools, academies, 
colleges, and an university,” are of considerable historical interest. All 
of these Sundry Documents have been digested in the preceding mono- 
graph. Although the pamphlet was printed by the managers of the literary 
fund and “distributed among the citizens of this Commonwealth” of Vir- 
ginia, yet it is not likely to have survived in any considerable number of 
copies. Friends of education in Virginia who happen to own these ‘‘Sun- 
dry Documents,” one of the primary sources of the higher educational his- 
tory of that State, would do well to present the pamphlet to public libra- 
ries and institutions of learning for preservation. 
Proceedings and Report of the Commissioners for the University of 
Virginia, presented December 8, 1818. Richmond, 1818. 
This document is quite as important as the one just mentioned, for it is the re- 
port of the Rockfish Gap Commission, which decided that the University 
of Virginia should be established upon the site of Jefferson’s “* Central 
College.” The commission was a brilliant idea, first suggested to the Leg-
-P-A-G-E-243

islature by Mr. Cabell. It was appointed by the Governor, who favored 
Jefferson’s project, from the senatorial districts of the State. Some of the 
best men in Virginia assembled at Rockfish Gap, a pass through the Blue 
Ridge to the Valley of Virginia, in August, 1818, and there came under the 
persuasive influence of Mr, Jefferson. He convinced the commission, by 
maps and ingenious diagrams, that, of all competitors for the University, 
the region of Charlottesville was nearest the geographical centre and near- 
est the centre of: white population. The idea of centrality and the educa- 
tional foundations already laid by Jefferson carried the day in opposition 
to Lexington and Staunton. Jefferson prepared a most elaborate report, 
containing his entire philosophy of education, from the primary school to 
the university. The original printed document has never come to the eye 
of the present writer, but he has found a printed copy in the Analectic 
Magazine, Vol. XII, pp. 103-116, Philadelphia, 1819. To this magazine Jef- 
ferson’s friend Dr. Cooper, the first professor in the University of Virginia, 
was acontributor. For example, see his review of Count Destutt Tracy’s 
Political Economy, in the March number, 1819, pp. 177-191. The book was 
a translation from the French, which Jefferson had caused to be made and 
published. This Analectic Magazine was evidently one of the means of 
contemporary propaganda for Jefferson’s ideas. The report of the Rockfish 
Gap Commission is also reprinted in the Early History of the University 
of Virginia, a valuable documentary collection described below.

This is adocumentary history of the University, and by far the most important 
work which has ever appeared upon the subject. The work contains Jef- 
ferson’s extensive correspondence with Cabell, some of which “ unpub- 
lished” material may also be found in Jefferson’s Writings, with Cabell’s 
name unfortunately omitted. The above volume contains also the published 
records of the trustees of Albemarle Academy, of the visitors of Central 
College, and to a limited extent of the visitors of the University of Vir- 
ginia. Jefferson’s most important educational reports and the early acts of 
legislation for the University are also to be found in this invaluable col- 
lection, for the use of which the writer is indebted to the courtesy of Pro-

These contain, in the most authentic form, the fundamental law and subsequent

Manuscript Catalogue of the University Library, by Jefferson. 
This is the only manuscript in Jefferson’s own hand that could be found in the 
University library. The catalogue gives additional evidence of Jeffer- 
son’s attention to details in the organization of his University. There 
are catalogued 2,436 volumes. described by Jefferson as 1 grand folio, 
168 folio, 388 4to, 1,609 8vo, 2,270 12mo. Jefferson classified the library 
as follows: (1) Ancient history; (2) Modern history (foreign); (3) Brit- 
ish; (4) American; (5) Ecclesiastical; (6) Physics; (7) Agriculture ; (8) 
Chemistry ; (9) Anatomy; (10) Surgery; (11) Medicine; (12) Zodlogy; 
(13) Botany ; (14) Mineralogy; (15) Technology; (16) Astronémy ; (17) 
i Geography, etc. He observes, characteristically, at the beginning of his 
catalogue: ‘‘ Books are addressed to the three faculties: memory, reason, 
imagination.” 
The University Memorial. By Rev. John Lipscomb Johnson. Balti- 
more: Turnbull Brothers. 1871. 
This work consists of a series of biographical sketches of alumni of the Univer- 
sity of Virginia who fell in the late Civil War, and contains many glowing 
tributes to the character and talents of the sons of this institution. 
The Gilmer Manuscripts. 
Inquiring of Col. Charles S. Venable, chairman: of the faculty of the University 
of Virginia, for original manuscript materials relating to that institution, 
the writer first learned of the existence of original and unpublished letters 
written by Thomas Jefferson to Francis W. Gilmer. Upon application to 
the present owner of the letters in question, John Gilmer, Esq., of Chat- 
ham, Pittsylvania County, Va., the writer was courteously intrusted with 
the entire bound collection, which includes not only letters from Jeffer- 
son, but also some from Madison and from the gentlemen in England to 
whom Gilmer had letters of introduction. There are letters of advice or 
suggestion from Major John Cartwright, Dugald Stewart, Benjamin Rush, 
Lord Brougham, Lord Teignmouth, Lord Forbes, Dr. Samuel Parr, Henry 
Drury of Harrow, Prof. John Leslie of Edinburgh, Peter Barlow of the 
Royal Military Academy, and many others. It is very interesting to trace in 
this correspondence the lines of personal influence, inquiry, and recommen- 
dation which led gradually to the selection and engagement of a faculty 
for the University of Virginia. Here are the letters written by Thomas 
‘Hewett Key, George Long, Dr. Dunglison, George Blaetterman, and va- 
rious other gentlemen with whom negotiations were opened. Much inter- 
esting light is thrown by the Gilmer manuscripts upon the beginnings of 
the University of Virginia. The collection, which is well preserved in a 
~ large volume, quarto, came into the writer’s hands too late to make any 
use of its contents in preparing the body of the present monograph, but 
he has appended in foot-notes to the chapter on the first professors certain 
selections from the Gilmer correspondence. By the consent of the owner of 
the manuscripts, the editor has committed the entire collection to one of his 
students from Virginia, William P. Trent, A. M., for further use. There are 
some very interesting letters from George Ticknor, written in Boston and 
at Goettingen; also several communications from the Abbé José Correa de 
Serra, Dupontde Nemours, and a great mass of unpublished letters from Will-

iam Wirt. The discovery of the Gilmer collection, which has fortunately 
survived the ravages of war, is only another illustration of the importance 
and practical value of American students utilizing academic connections. 
and the historical environment for the prosecution of their original studies. 
Probably the Gilmer collection is but one of many family collections of im- 
portant papers which might be made useful to historical science in the hands 
of students. The field of American educational history is comparatively 
unbroken, and it is not unlikely that many other interesting materials and . 
discoveries may yet be made. It is the ploughing of new lands that un- 
earths interesting relics of a forgotten race, and it will prove no ungrate- 
ful task to follow in the track of educational pioneers like Thomas Jef- 
ferson and Francis Gilmer.

George Tucker was professor of moral philosophy in the University of Virginia,

to professors and students is striking. Every week Jefferson had a little 
company of students to dine with him, although he himself, being a little 
deaf, sat apart in order not to repress student conversation.

He was then eighty-two years old, with his intellectual powers unshaken 
by age, and the physical man so active that he rode to and fro from Mon- 
ticello, and took exercise on foot with all the activity of one twenty or 
thirty years younger. He sympathized with us on the discomforts of our 
long voyage, and on the disagreeable journey we must have passed over 
the Virginia roads; and depicted to us the great distress he had felt lest 
we had been lost at sea, for he had almost given us up when my letter ar- 
rived with the joyful intelligence we were safe.”

JEFFERSON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
Jaines Parton’s Life of Thomas Jefferson. Boston, 1874, 
Chapter LXX, on Jefferson’s labors to promote education, is very cleverly writ- 
ten, and contains valuable information, derived from Prof. Charles S. 
Venable, on the examination system of the University, the healthful re- 
ligious life there prevailing, and the moral effect of trusting to student 
honor. In Mr. Parton’s book are valuable notices of Dr. Priestley and Dr. 
Cooper. Kt appears.that the latter suffered under the Alien and Sedition 
Acts for harmless animadversions upon John Adams. Judge Chase imposed 
upon Cooper a fine of $400 and sentenced him to prison for six months. Jeffer- 
son’s relations to Cooper and Priestley are well described. Parton’s work 
contains a heliotype reproduction of a somewhat remarkable portrait of 
Jefferson, painted by Rembrandt Peale in 1803, and now in the possession of 
the New York Historical Society.

This contains an article by Edward Everett in review of Jefferson’s report for 
the Rockfish Gap Commission. The article is interesting as an expression 
of Northern opinion respecting the new educational departure in Virginia. 
Jefferson himself read the article, and commented upon it in a letter to 
John Adams, August 15, 1820. 
American Quarterly Review, June, 1831. Article by Dr. Dunglison 
on ‘College Instruction and Discipline.” 
This article contains an important discussion of the subject of student co-op- 
eration in the matter of college discipline, by one of the original professors, 
who held views somewhat opposed to those of Mr. Jefferson. Cf, Randall’s 
Life of Jefferson, III, 517-519, where the story of the disorders that oc- 
curred even in the time of Mr. Jefferson are plainly told. In spite of the 
disagreeable experiences through which, in common with most colleges, 
the University of Virginia has passed in the matter of student riots (of 
which Dr. Dunglison, Professor Tucker, and Professor Minor tell the un- 
varnished truth), there has certainly resulted from Mr. Jefferson’s original 
experiment in college government a remarkable harmony between the 
faculty and the students. The principles of authority and self-government, 
of law and liberty, have found a happy reconciliation. Jefferson was early 
convinced of this possibility. He wrote-to Governor Giles: ‘A finer set of 
youths I never saw assembled for instruction. They committed some irregu- 
larities at first, until they learned the lawful length of their tether ; since 
which it has never been transgressed in the smallest degree.” 
. H. Tutwiler, in his address before the alumni society of the University of 
Virginia, June 29, 1882, said: “It is but recently, as we learn from the 
newspapers, that the distinguished president of Amherst College has sub-

mitted to the students of that institution a proposition to make them 
judges, under certain limitations, in the matter of discipline. This was pre- 
cisely the plan of Mr. Jefferson, as set forth in the first published edition of 
the laws.” 
Niles’s Register, 15; Supplement, 79. 
Under the heads of “‘ Education,” ‘‘Jeffersou,” ‘ Virginia,” in Niles’s Register, 
various interesting allusions to the University may be found. The state of 
the Literary Fund is from time to time noted, e. g., January 10, 1818. 
Bohn’s Album. 
This work is remarkable solely for its pictures of professors and for its views 
of the University. Two engravings from Bohn have bees reproduced in 
this report. 
Southern Literary Messenger, January, 1842, and April, 1856. 
This interesting repository of Southern literature before the War contains two 
articles on the University of Virginia, bearing respectively the above 
dates. Most remarkable side-lights are thrown upon the institution by ob- 
servers belonging to those times. Friendly, although critical, their testi- 
mony is highly valuable. The first article contains interesting sketches of 
three professors whom the University had lost—Bonnycastle, Davis, and 
the German, Dr. Blaetterman—from which sketches the present writer has 
already drawn. 
The second article, published fourteen years later, is devoted to ‘‘The Univer- 
sity: its Character and Wants.” ‘his is a very spirited and refreshing cri- 
tique of the institution by one who evidently had its interests warmly at 
heart. The author, who is evidently a Southerner and has seen something 
of the world, possibly at a German university, rushes with a free lance at 
some of the weak points of the rural civilization of the Old South, and 
does not spare the University of Virginia. This critic, whoever he was, 
uttered some rather striking ante-bellum observations. He said: ‘‘ In the 
* way of general culture our Southern States generally are not abreast of 
the major part of those other civilized States whom we consider our peers. 
Even if slavery is a blessing, even if our social state is superior to that 
of France or that of Maine, slavery will not therefore supply or be a sub- 
stitute for art. Slavery can not playatune. * * * Where are the fine 
arts? Whereis our music? Where are our pictures? Where are our sculpt- 
ures? Where are the treasures of our science? And, saddest yet, where 
is our literature? Will any man say that our civilization has culminated? 
“The great immediate wants of Virginia are physical and intellectual devel- 
opment, railroads, and educational appliances. If the physical resuurces 
of Virginia were developed, wealth and the growth of towns would result. 
* * * Railroads are as essential as the schools. There can be no higher 
development, no outbreaking of the intellect, without a dense population, 
or without towns. Minds must be brought together.” This reformer then 
advocates with great vigor a policy of internal improvements, with liberal 
provisions for education, ‘‘ beginning with the University.” He states, 
if not quite fairly, yet with perfect freedom, the condition of that institu- 
tion as it appeared in 1856. He says: ‘‘ Not a solitary additional chair has 
been established since its original foundation. For years, and years, and 
years, $15,000 has been its annuity. No sort of effort has been made to ex- 
tendits provisions. No kind of modification has been adopted from regard 
to the advancement of knowledge. It is just like those old French diligences 
that have been running ever since the Merovingian dynasty.” This aggres- 
sive writer then proceeds to urge a longer sojourn of students at the Univer-

sity; greater attention to their qualifications for admission; the division 
of the chair of ancient languages into two professorships, one of Latin, 
the other of Greek [this was done in 1856]; the institution of a chair of 
history and English literature [1857]; a chair of geology [1857] and prac- 
tical mining ; increase of the University library. Upon this latter point 
the critic speaks feelingly: ‘‘Our earliest recollections are of seeing in 
Smith’s Geography that the library of the University contained 17,000 vol- 
umes.” After a long period, he says the collection has increased to 18,000 ; 
but now for many years ‘‘no additions whatever have been made to the 
library.” 
He next urges the establishment of fellowships, yielding a few hundred dollars 
a year, ‘for the purpose of fostering and encouraging an elevated scholar- 
ship.” He reviews, with evident understanding and appreciation, the fel- 
lowship system of Oxford and Cambridge, and also describes the prizes and 
scholarships then offered at Harvard and Yale Colleges. He explains accu- 
rately and approvingly the German system of recruiting professorships 
from privatdocenten, or private lecturers, who establish themselves at a uni- 
versity and compete with one another and with the regular professors. He 
contrasts the German system with the English, saying, “the professors at 
Oxford and Cambridge do no work at all; they deliver an occasional lan- 
guid lecture; but the business of instruction is committed to private tutors, 
who are in no way as such connected with the university.” The critic 
then proceeds to urge university provision for the study of Christianity, 
its philosophy and literature. ‘‘ Why should the authenticity or genuine- 
ness of Homer be a matter of livelier interest than who wrote the Penta- 
teuch?” ‘Then follows a searching review of the educational results actu- 
ally accomplished at the University of Virginia by a student who reaches 
the highest grade, master of arts, and compares them with the results of 
higher educationin Germany. While not yielding superiority of university 
standards to any American institution, the critic reviews in a frank and 
suggestive way the courses of instruction, number of instructors, etc., at 
the University of Virginia, at American colleges, and at various English 
and German universities. The statistics were well calculated to induce 
reflection. ‘Che University of Virginia had, all told, 15 instructors ; Har- 
yard, 42; Yale, 43; Princeton, 20; Amherst, 17; Montreal, 18; Quebec, 
22; Oxford, 593; Cambridge, 482; Berlin, 152; Bonn, 70; Leipsic, 97; 
Munich, 66; Tiibingen, 62; Gottingen, 83; Heidelberg, 62. 
He notes the relative size of college libraries in this country in 1855-56: Har- 
yard, 101,000 volumes ; Yale, 63,000; Brown, 34,000; Bowdoin, 28,000; Dart- 
mouth, 32,000; Georgetown, 25,000; South Carolina College, 22,000; Frank- 
lin, in Athens, Ga., 10,000; Saint Mary’s, Maryland, 20,000. He then con- 
trasts the annual appropriations for educational purposes in the dif- 
ferent States, for schools alone: Massachusetts, $1,140,000; New York, 
$3,046,430; New Jersey, $388,572; Pennsylvania, $2,0U0,000 and over; Mis- 
souri, $210,000; Delaware, $50,000; North Carolina, $240,000; Tennessee, 
$280,000; Louisiana, $250,000. ‘In Virginia the annual appropriation 
from the literary fund and the capitation tax amounts to about $170,000, in- 
cluding the University and the Institute.” He then compares relative en- 
dowments and appropriations for the higher education: Harvard had, in 
1855, over'a million dollars endowment, and annual receipts from the same, 
from tuition, ete., of $256,303. The University of Virginia had $15,000 per 
annum from*the Legislature, and this sum, with total receipts from tui- 
tion, room-rent, ete., would amount perhaps to $65,000 per annum. South 
Carolina was then appropriating $21,000 a year to her college at Columbia ;
-P-A-G-E-249
oe BIBLIOGRAPHY. 211 
Alabama and Louisiana were giving about $30,000 a year to their colleges ; 
and Mississippi appropriated annually to her university $17,000. 
The significance of these facts and figures could not have escaped the critic’s 
mind, nor that of his readers in 1856. The object of the entire article was ° 
clearly to arouse public opinion to the needs of the university situation 
in Virginia. The author wished to secure a more hearty support of the in- 
stitution, an increase of the faculty, better pay for the professors, alumni 
representation upon the board of visitors, and many other excellent reforms. 
He wished greater attention to be given to the qualifications of students 
entering the University and a longer sojourn there. Inadequate prepara- 
tion for university work and insufficient time for a liberal education ap- 
pear to have been radical student faults at the University of Virginia; but 
it is well known that the authorities have always maintained high stand- 
ards of examination and graduation. The small proportion of honors 
awarded in 1854-55, as compared with the total number of students in the 
various schools, is very striking:

1 There were 18 graduates in French, 13 in Spanish, 9 in German, and 5 in Italian; bat 
none who were graduated from the entire school of modern lanzuages. 2 The autor now under review says the course in mathematics at the University of 
Virginia ‘‘is almost identically the West Point course, where mathematics is the main 
and engrossing study.” 
In the above attendance upon the various schools some students are counted 
more than once. There were in all that year, 1854-55, at the University, 
514 students; 352 in the academic as distinguished from the professional 
schools, The proportion of graduates to undergraduates in other American 
colleges was, and still is, much higher than at the University of Virginia. 
In 1854, at Harvard, there were in all 329 undergraduates, of whom 88 were 
Seniors, destined, by far the greater part, to receive their diplomas in 
course. At Yale, in 1855, there were 473 undergraduates, including 97 
Seniors, most of whom received their degree of B. A. That same year, 
at the University of Virginia, while 106 men, out of a total of 352, were 
eraduated from individual academic schools, only 3 succeeded in taking 
the degree of B. A., and only 7 the master’s degree. From statistical evi- 
dence like this, which runs through earlier anJ later years, from the recog- 
nized ability and requirements of the professors since the very foundation 
of the University, and from the-high repute in which its degrees have, 
always been held, it is clear that the standards of higher education in Vir- 
ginia were kept above reproach, whatever the drawbacks and difficulties 
of the situation. 
Mr. Jefferson’s Pet [the University of Virginia]. Harpers’ Magazine, 
May, 1872. 
This readable and well-illustrated article was written by Prof. Schele de Vere, 
of the University of Virginia. It attracted the writer’s attention when a 
college student, and was his first introduction to a knowledge and appreci- 
ation of that Southern institution. A year later (1873) he met upon an 
ocean steamer a professor of Latin from that institution, and received from 
him his first letters of introduction to professors in Berlin. This was the 
beginning of an academic comity of interest, which the writer of this report 
is disposed to cherish. Prof. Schele de Vere’s article is reprinted as a pref- 
ace to the following valuable work, edited by him:

This painstaking compilation was a labor of love by Prof. Schele de Vere, and 
as a basis for estimating the influence of the University of Virginia upon 
the South, it has been of great value to Mr. William P. Trent, one of its 
graduates, who has made a valuable contribution, descriptive and statisti- 
cal, to the present report.

University of Virginia. The Old Dominion Magazine, Richmond, Va., 
Vol. IV and Vol. V, beginning March 15, 1870, and ending June 15, 
1871. 
These sketches of the University of Virginia are short articles extending 
through fourteen different numbers of a popular magazine, now discontin- 
ued and very scarce. These sketches were published anonymously, but the 
present writer finds them accredited to Professor John B. Minor among 
the publications by Virginia authors in the period from 1867 to 1873, a valu- 
able list appended to the third annual report of Dr. W. H. Ruffner, super- 
intendent of public instruction in Virginia. Through the courtesy of Pro- 
fessor Minor the writer has been permitted to examine the author’s anno- 
tated copy of these sketches, which, it is understood, he intends at some 
time to revise and publish in book form. They cover the entire history of 
the University from its origin down to the time immediately preceding the 
Civil War, with an occasional reference to academic matters since that date. 
The work is by far the most important source of information for the local 
and internal history of the University. It contains information upon the 
gradual growthand development of the University, the history and personnel 
of its departments, the extension of its buildings, and the financial history 
and administration of the institution. 
Particular emphasis is laid upon the importance of reviving Mr. Jefferson’s plan 
for the payment of professors partly by a fixed salary and partly by fees 
from students, according to the views of Adam Smith and Dupont de Ne- 
mours, and according to the long-established practice of certain European 
universities. 
Mr. Jefferson’s idea was to make the self-interest of the professors co-operate 
with their sense of duty, instead of directly opposing it. The theory is, 
that when the amount of a professor’s remuneration for his services de- 
pends upon his success, in competition with other professors, then his 
entire energy goes into his professorial work ; when his salary is fixed and 
protected from competition, laziness or indifference to duty sometimes 
overcomes him, or else his activities seek other channels ; this latter is al- 
most certain to be the result when success meets with no adequate reward. 
On the other hand, it may be said that academic competition breeds inter- 
nal dissensions, constant rivalry and jealousy among professors, and an 
eagerness for money-making, which is the root of all evil; moreover, on
-P-A-G-E-251

principles of competition pure science can never prosper in a university 
when its professors are rewarded according to standards of popularity. It 
is, however, as Mr. Minor clearly demonstrates, both unwise and unjust to 
disregard altogether economic laws in the appointment and payment of pro- 
fessors. The popularity, success, amount, and character of a professor’s 
work, as determined by a subtle law of competition, must always be taken 
into account in the estimate of the value of his services. Without a retarn 
to the Jeffersonian principle it is doubtful whether the University of Vir- 
ginia could have been so quickly revived after the War, although, te Mr. 
Minor’s regret, it has since returned to the principle of fixed salaries.

ent of Public Instruction, 1872. 
This excellent account of the University of Virginia, by Professor Minor, was

the administration and resources of the University. Professor Minor contrib- 
uted a paper on the administration of the University to the appendix of the

This monograph contains (pp. 58-61) some facts illustrating the early rivalry of 
the University of Virginia and of the royal old college at Williamsburg. If 
the latter institution had succeeded in getting to Richmond, as intended in 
1818, it would have been greatly invigorated by that municipal environment. 
A historic college in the capital of the State would have endangered the 
success of Jefferson’s university. He and Cabell, however, defeated the 
threatening project by skilful tactics in the Legislature. 
Local Examinations adopted by the University of Virginia. By

July, 1877. 
This article describes a plan, authorized circa 1877 by the board of visitors, for 
local examinations of persons not members of the University, on the model 
of the tests established by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Ox- 
ford introduced this system in 1857, and Cambridge followed in 1858. 
Girls were admitted to Cambridge local examinations in 1865, and to the 
Oxford locals some years later. The examinations instituted in Virginia 
were in no way connected with entrance examinations to the University,

The Virginia University Magazine. : 
This periodical is edited by representatives of the two literary societies of the 
University, and has been in existence for many years. The writer of this 
report observed a bound set in the library of the Young Men’s Christian 
Association at the University of Virginia, which college association is the 
oldest and one of the most flourishing in the country. It was founded at 
the University in the year 1858. In the same library are bound volumes of 
the various addresses given before the society of the alumni, founded in 1838. 
It is the custom to invite distinguished graduates to address the students of 
the University. In the same library collection are very many printed ser- 
mons and religious addresses delivered before the students by distinguished 
clergymen invited for the purpose. These discourses and the earnest char- 
acter of the Young Men’s Christian Association at the University of Vir- 
ginia, together with the maintenance of a university chaplain by voluntary 
subscriptions, are a sufficient refutation of the charges of irreligion which 
have frequently been made against the institution.

first time I saw Mr. Jefferson. It wasin 1825, in the proctor’s office, whither 
Ihad gone with some students on business. A tall, yenerable gentleman,

in plain but neat attire, entered the room, and, bowing to the students, took 
his seat quietly in one corner. One of my friends privately gave me to un-— 
derstand that it was Mr. Jefferson, I was struck by his plain appearance 
and simple, unassuming manners. When Mr. Brockenbrough was done 
with the students he looked up and recognized Mr. Jefferson, who then 
came forward to greet him. We used to see him afterwards as he passed 
our room on the eastern range in his almost daily visits to the Univer- 
sity. He was now in his eighty-third year, and this ride of eight or ten 
miles on horseback over a rough mountain road shows the deep interest 
with which he watched over this child of his old age, and why he preferred 
the more endearing title of Father to that of founder. This is also shown in 
the frequent intercourse which he kept up with the faculty and students. 
Two or three times a week the former, often with their families, dined 
with him by invitation, and once a week he had the students. 
list of these, and through one of his grandsons, then a studént in the Uni- 
versity, four or five were invited to dine with him on the Sunday following. 
This day was selected because it did not interfere with the regular lectures. 
When he found that some of the students declined the invitation from relig- 
ious convictions, he ascertained how many there were of this class, and in- 
vited them on aweek-day. Mr. Jefferson had a wonderful tact in interesting 
his youthful visitors, and making the most diffident, feel at ease in his com- 
pany. He knew from what county each student came, and being well ac- 
quainted with the most prominent men in every part of the State, he would 
draw out the student by asking questions concerning them, or about some- 
thing remarkable in his neighborhood, thus making one feel that he was 
giving instead of receiving information; or he would ask about the stud- 
ies of the students, and make remarks about them or the professors, for all 
of whom he had a high admiration. He was thus careful to pay attention 
to each individual student.” 
Address of Hon. W. C. Rives on Life and Work of W. B. Rodgers, 1833. 
Address of Prof. Asaph Hall, U.S. Navy, on opening the Leander 
McCormick Observatory, 1885.

CHAPTER XVI. 
HAMPDEN-SIDNEY COLLEGE. 
By C. R. MoILwarne.! 
Hampden-Sidney College, in Prince Edward County, Virginia, claims 
an age of more than one hundred and eleven years. As Prince Ed- 
ward Academy, it originally formed one of the series of log colleges 
which, during the eighteenth century, began to look out from the shade 
of the forest, and to extend among the people the civilizing influence 
of letters. Its foundation is to be attributed to the intellectual and 
religious energies of the descendants of Scotch and Scotch-Irish blood, 
many representatives of which had left their native countries and the 
more settled portions of eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, to found 
in portions of Virginia a suitable inheritance for their posterity. 
The Synod of Philadelphia had already, in 1738, petitioned the Goy- 
ernor of Virginia to protect those of this race and religion, settling the 
valley in the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty. Having received 
a favorable response, the authorized representative of the Synod began 
to settle Presbyterian families in Charlotte, Prince Edward, and Camp- 
bell. Families of this race were, at this time, scattered throughout 
Virginia; but, owing to the popular sentiment in favor of the established. 
church, there had hitherto failed to exist between them that bond of 
civil and religious community which afterwards became so prominent a 
factor in the Revolutionary era of the State. 
During an early period of the last half of the eighteenth century, 
after the formation of Hanover Presbytery, the relations between the 
Presbyterians became more firmly established, and they began now to 
excite attention as a positive element in State politics. 
The College of New Jersey, the historic survivor of Nassau Hall, was 
laying deep the foundation for an accurate culture, and became a re- 
sort for Presbyterians who desired to extend their religious and mental 
training. Samuel Stanhope Smith, a native of Lancaster County, Pa., 
and a graduate of the College of New Jersey in 1769, subsequently united 
with the Presbytery at Hanover, in Virginia, and represented the cause 
IMr. Clement R. McIlwaine is a graduate of Hampden-Sidney College and a son of 
its distinguished president, Dr. Richard McIlwaine. He studied for some time in the 
historical department of the Johns Hopkins University, and was subsequently gradu- 
ated at the law school of the University of Maryland, in Baltimore. The editor of 
this report takes this occasion of thanking his former pupil for preparing the present 
chapter.—EDITOR. 3

of religion and education with such eminence as to make his name his- 
toric in the early annals of the Commonwealth. The cause of learning 
among the Presbyterians in Virginia was already advancing apace, 
when the impetus, happily given to it by the New Jersey pioneer, may 
be said to have occasioned the foundation of two academies—Prince 
Edward and Liberty Hall—each tracing its origin from one parent 
source. Under the auspices of Hanover Presbytery the Prince Edward 
Academy was opened to students in January, 1776, under the con 
trol and direction of Samuel Stanhope Smith, rector, to whose magical 
influence its early prosperity may be attributed. The Presbytery, con- 
sulting the best interests of the academy, endeavored to encourage 
every necessary branch of literature, and, while reserving a preference 
in favor of the Presbyterian service, extended the benefits of the foun. 
dation to all denominations. 
The name of Prince Edward Academy was changed to that of Hamp- 
den-Sidney in May, 1777, in honor of those principles of political lib- 
erty which had been sealed by the blood of martyrs. Among the trus 
tees of the academy may be mentioned the names of James Madison and - 
Patrick Henry; which indicate that the institution was a product of 
civil and religious liberty, and was first launched upon its existence 
during the most important epoch in our history. 
In October, 1779, the rector was released from his duties in order to 
accept the professorship of moral philosophy in the College of New 
Jersey ; his brother, the Rev. John Blair Smith, by common consent 
succeeded him. The second rector of the academy, who afterwards 
became the first president of the College, when chartered by the 
Legislature of the State in 1783, was also a graduate of the College of 
New Jersey, and, through the influence of the two brothers, the curricu- 
lum and government came to resemble the Princeton model. Those who 
were most closely comnected with the early history of Hampden-Sidney, 
were allied by ties of sympathy and respect with that central school, 
which had been so essential, not only in directing the educational tend- 
encies, but also in shaping the political and religious principles, which 
were adhered to with such fidelity by the Presbyterians! until the bill 
1JIn this connection the editor notes the historical importance of the early move- 
sments in behalf of religious liberty in Virginia by the Hanover Presbytery in 1774. 
Hon. William Wirt Henry, of Richmond, who has discussed the pioneer influence 
of Patrick Henry in promoting religious freedom (see papers of the American His- 
torical Association, Vol. III, and Dr. Stillé’s reply, Vol. III), has lately made a valu- 
able documentary discovery, which is described and published in the Central Presby- 
terian, Richmond, May 16, 1888. Mr. Henry’s letter and the document in question 
are here reprinted in full:   
“RICHMOND, VA., May 7, 1888. 
“Tn looking among the archives of the State a few days ago, I found a paper of 
great historical value, in its bearing on the part taken by the Presbyterian Church 
in the struggle for religious liberty in Virginia. I enclose it with the request that it 
be published, and although it was written in 1774, this will be its first publication. 
“ The occasion of its preparation was the introduction in the House of Burgesses 
in 1772 of a bill having for its professed object the better security of the religious

for establishing religious freedom was finally enacted in 1785. Histori- 
cal justice claims honorable mention of the first president of Hampden 
Sidney, in his defence of religious liberty before the committee of the 
whole house in the Virginia Assembly, sustained by an eloquence and 
astuteness which were said by many to have excelled Patrick Henry. 
In characterizing that civil and religious conflict, in the midst of which 
Hampden-Sidney was called to life, the memorial from Hanover Pres. 
bytery of 1776 most fittingly expresses the sentiments of our founders: 
“ That duty which we owe our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, 
ean only be directed by reason and conviction, and is nowhere cogniz-   
liberty of Protestant dissenters in the colony, but really contrived for their oppres- 
sion in several particulars. The objectionable features are commented upon in the 
paper now sent you. Foote, in his Sketches of Virginia, p. 320, states the dissatis- 
faction of Hanover Presbytery with the proposed bill, and the appointment of Rev. 
John Todd and Capt. John Morton as commissioners to attend the next Assembly in 
opposition to it. Nothing was done in the next Assembly touching the matter, and 
at the meeting at the house of Robert Caldwell, on Cub Creek, in Charlotte County, 
October 14, 1774, there being apprehension that the Assembly would take action 
during the fall session, the Presbytery adjourned to meet on the second Wednesday 
of November next, at the house of Col. William Cabell, of Amherst, to remonstrate 
against the bill. This paper is that remonstrance, and is most interesting and in- 
structive, not only because of its ability and the light it sheds on the then condition 
of the Church and the colony, but because it is the first paper of the kind, so far as I 
have seen, which was ever presented to the Virginia Assembly claiming equal rights 
for dissenters. It may therefore be regarded: as the advance guard of that army of 
remonstrances which so vigorously attacked the Establishment, and finally overpow- 
ered it and established perfect religious liberty on its ruins. 
“ Foote evidently never saw this paper. Taking it in connection with the able 
memorials of Hanover Presbytery in 1776 and 1777, which Foote gives in full, the 
reader can have no difficulty in seeing where M® Jefferson, who was a member of the 
Assembly, got his views of religious liberty. His famous bili was not written before 
1777, nor reported before 1779, and it shows no more advanced thought on the sub- 
ject than the able papers of Hanover Presbytery. I will add that it is probable that 
Rey. Caleb Wallace, who wrote the memorial of 1776, wrote this paper. He was a 
graduate of Princeton, and became in later life a distinguished judge in Kentucky. 
“Wa. WirT HENRY.” 
“* To the Honorable the Speaker and the Gentlemen of the House of Burgesses : 
“The Petition of the Presbytery of Hanover, in behalf of themselves, and all the 
Presbyterians in Virginia in particular, and all Protestant dissenters in general, 
humbly showeth, That upon application made by the Rev. Mr. James Anderson in 
behalf of the Synod of Philadelphia, the Honorable Governor Gooch, with the advice 
of the council, did in the year 1738, or about that time, for the encouragement of all 
Presbyterians who might incline to settle in the colony, grant an instrument of writ- 
ing under the seal of the colony, containing the most ample assurances that they 
should enjoy the full and free exercise of their religion, and all the other privileges 
of good subjects. Relying upon this express stipulation, as well as upon the justice 
and catholic spirit of the whole legislative body, several thousand families of Presby- 
terians have removed from the Northern provinces into the frontiers of this colony, 
exposed themselves to a cruel and savage enemy, and all the other toils and dangers 
of settling a new country, and soon became a barrier to the former inhabitants who 
were settled in the’more commodious parts of the colony. Ever since that time we 
have been considered and treated upon an equal footing with our fellow subjects, 
nor haye our ministers or people been restricted in their religious privileges by any

able but at the tribunal of the Universal Judge.” “ In this enlightened 
age, and in a land where all are united in the most strenuous efforts to 
be free, we hope and expect that our representatives will cheerfully con- 
cur in removing every species of civil as well as religious bondage.” 
By the act of 1783 the academy became a college, thereby dissolving 
all connection with the parent presbytery. The ties of an earlier con- 
nection, however, have not been forgotten or ignored, and the board of 
trustees, which has annnally assembled under the protection of the 
charter since 1783, has been often constrained to refer with pride to the 
parent of one of the most important literary institutions in the State.   
Jaw of the colony. Your humble petitioners further show, that with gratitude they 
acknowledge the catholic design of our late honorable Assembly to secure by law the 
religious liberties of all Protestant dissenters in the colony; accordingly they did in 
the year 1772 prepare and print a Toleration Bill, but as the subject was deeply in- 
teresting it was generously left open for amendment. But notwithstanding we are 
fully persuaded of the catholic and generous design of our late representatives, yet 
we are deeply sensible that some things in the above named bill will be very grievous 
and burdensome to us if passed into alaw. Therefore we humbly and earnestly pray 
that the said bill may not be established without such alterations and amendments 
as will render it more agreeable to the principles of impartial liberty and sound policy, 
which we presume were the valuable ends for which it was first intended. Therefore 
we humbly beg leave, while we are making the prayer of our petition in a more par- 
ticular way, to lay before this honorable House, in the most respectful manner, a few 
remarks upon the Dill. 
“The preamble is agreeable to what we desire, only we pray that the preamble and 
every other part of the bill may be so expressed as will be most likely to obtain the 
royal assent. 
“We are also willing that all our clergymen should be required to take the oaths of 
allegiance, etc., usually taken by civil officers, and to declare their belief of the Holy 
Scriptures. ¢ 
“Likewise, as is required in the said bill, we shall willingly have all our churches 
and stated places for public worship registered, if this honorable House shall think 
proper to grant it. But every minister of the gospel is under indispensable obliga- 
tions to follow the example of our blessed Savior, ‘who went about doing good,’ and 
the example of his Apostles, who not only ‘taught in the Temple, but in every house 
where they came they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.’ From which, 
and their constant practice of travelling into every quarter of the world, we humbly 
trust that it will appear to this Assembly that we cannot, consistent with the du- 
ties of our office, wholly confine our ministrations to any place or number of places: 
and to be limited by law would be the more grievous, because in many parts of this 
colony, even where the majority of the inhabitants are Presbyterians, it is not, and 
perhaps it may not in any short time be, easy to determine where it would be the most 
expedient to fix upon a stated place for public worship, and, indeed, where we have 
houses for worship already built, generally the bounds of our congregation are so 
very extensive that many of our people, especially women, children, and servants, 
are not able to attend by reason of the distance, which makes it our duty, as faithful 
ministers of Christ, to double our diligence, and frequently to lecture and catechise 
in the remote corners of our congregations. This restriction would also be very 
grievous to us in many other respects. We only beg leave to add: That the number 
of Presbyterians in this province is now very great and the number of clergymen but 
small, therefore we are obliged frequently to itinerate and preach through various 
parts of the colony, that our people may have an opportunity to worship God and re- 
ceive the sacraments in the way agreeable to their own consciences. As to our hay-

  HAMPDEN-SIDNEY COLLEGE. 231 
The historic influence to which Hampden-Sidney owes its origin has 
been briefly ‘stated, and as the second college founded in the history of 
the State, its life began under different auspices from those of the more 
venerable William and Mary, which sprang into existence at a period 
when a college was the dream of individuals, but had made no im- 
press upon the people of the colony. Nor is there any historic connec- 
tion between Hampden-Sidney and the University of Virginia, which 
was matured many years after the organic life of Hampden-Sidney be- 
gan. The educational ideas of Jefferson found embodiment in an in- 
stitution which has proved a fountain of intellectual culture, not only   
ing meetings for public worship in the night, it is not in frequent practice among 
our churches; yet sometimes we find it expedient to attend night meetings, that a 
neighborhood may hear a sermon or a lecture, or be catechised, without being much 
interrupted in their dailylabor. And so long as our fellow-subjects are permitted to 
meet together by day or by night for the purposes of business or diversion, we hope 
we shall not be restrained from meeting together, as opportunity serves us, upon 
business of all others the most important; especially if it be considered that the 
Apostles held frequent societies by night, and once St. Paul continued his speech 
till midnight; accordingly it is well known that in city and collegiate churches even- 
ing prayers and lectures have long been esteemed lawful and profitable exercises. 
As to any bad influence this practice may have upon servants or any others, it is suffi- 
cient to say that there is nothing in our principles or way of worship that tends to 
promote a spirit of disobedience or disorder, but much to the contrary; and if any 
person shall be detected.in doing or teaching anything criminal in this respect, we 
presume he is liable to punishment by a law already in being; therefore we pray that 
no dissenting minister, according to law, may be subjected to any penalty for preach. 
ing or teaching at any time, or in any place in this colony. 
“‘We confess it is easy for us to keep open doors in time of divine service, except in 
case of a storm or other inclemencies of the weather; yet we would humbly represent 
that such a requirement implies a suspicion of our loyalty, and will fix a stigma upon 
us to after ages, such as we presume our honorable representatives will not judge 
that we have anyhow incurred; therefore we pray that this clause may also be re- 
moved from the bill. 
“And as to baptizing or receiving servants into our communion, we have awa 
anxiously desired to do it with the permission of their masters; but when a servant 
appears to be a true penitent and makes profession of his faith in Christ, upon his 
desire it is our indispensable duty to admit him into our Church, and if he has never 
been baptized, we are to baptize him according to the command of Christ: ‘Go ye 
therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I 
have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. 
Amen.’ And we are so confidently persuaded of the liberal sentiments of this House, 
that in obeying the laws of Christ, we shall never be reduced to the necessity of diso- 
beying the laws of our country. 
“« And we also, having abundant reasons to hope that we shall be indulged in every 
other thing that may appear reasonable, your petitioners further pray: 
“For liberty and protection in the discharge of all the functions and duties of our 
office as ministers of the gospel, and that the penalties to be inflicted on those who 
may disturb any of our congregations in the time of divine service, or misuse the 
preacher, be the same as on those who disturb the congregation or misuse the preach- 
ers of the Church of England, and that the dissenting clergy, as well as the clergy 
of the Established Church, be excused from all burdensome offices. All which we 
conceive is granted in the English Toleration Act.

for Virginia, but for the entire South. Hampden-Sidney has remained 
true to its original vocation as a college, and cannot offer to-day more 
_ extensive advantages than might be reasonably expected from the terms 
of the original charter. This. instrament, however, is so liberal in its 
character that no recourse to the ey for revisal or amendment 
has ever been deemed necessary. 
According to charter provisions the corporation was established with 
a view to diffusing useful knowledge among the citizens of the Common. 
wealth. Under the legal title of ‘‘ President and Trustees of Hampden- 
Sidney College,” every right is accorded by law which is necessary to 
perpetuate a useful existence, and no legislative stricture is imposed to 
mar the symmetry of its development. By Article IV “ the president   
which is allowed by law to every member of the British Empire in civil affairs, and 
which has long been so friendly to the cause of liberty. 
"And also we pray for a right by law to hold estates, and enjoy donations and lega- ~ 
cies for the support of our churches and schools for the instruction of our youth. 
Though this is not expressed in the English Act of Toleration, yet the yreatest law- 
yers in England have plead, and the best judges have determined, that it is manifestly 
implied, 
“Finally, we pray that nothing in the Act of Toleration may be so expressed as to 
render us suspicious or odious to our countrymen, with whom we desire to live in peace 
and friendship; but that all misdemeanors committed by dissenters may be punished 
by laws equally binding upon all our fellow subjects, without any regard to their re- 
‘ligious tenets. Or if any non-compliance with the conditions of the Act of Toleration 
shall be judged to deserve punishment, we pray that the crime may be accurately 
detined and the penalty ascertained by the Legislature; and that neither be left to 
the discretion of any magistrate or court whatsoever. 
“¢ May it please this honorable Assembly, there are some other things which we omit, 
because they are less essential to the rights of conscience and the interest of our 
Church; we trust that we petition for nothing but what justice says ought to be ours, 
for as ample privileges as any of our fellow-subjects enjoy: ‘To have and enjoy the 
fall and free exercise of our religion, without molestation or danger of incurring any 
penalty whatsoever.’ We are petitioning in favor of a Church that is neither con- 
temptible nor obscure. It prevails in every province to the northward of Maryland, 
and its advocates in all the more southern provinces are numerous and respectable ; 
the greatest monarch in the north of Europe adorns it; it is the established religion 
of the populous and wealthy states of Holland; it prevails in the wise and happy 
cantons of Switzerland; and it is the possession of Geneva, a state among the fore- 
most of those who, at the Reformation, emancipated themselves from the slavery of 
Rome; and some of the first geniuses and writers in every branch of literature were 
sons of our Church. 
“The subject is of such solemn importance to us that, comparatively speaking, our 
lives and our liberties are but of little value; and the population of the country and 
the honor of the Legislature, as well as the interest of American liberty, are certainly 
most deeply concerned in the matter. Therefore we would willingly lay before this 
honorable House a more extensive view of our reasons in favor of an unlimited, im- 
partial Toleration; but fearing we should transgress upon the patience of the House, 
we conclude with praying that the allwise, just, and merciful God would direct you 
in this and all your other important determinations.

and trustees are authorized to grant degrees in as ample a manner as 
any college in America can do, and to elect and commission, under their 
common seal, professors and masters.” “The greatest care and caution 
shall be used in electing such professors and masters, to the end that no 
person shall be so elected unless the uniform tenor of his conduct mani- 
fests to the world his sincere affection for the liberty and independence 
of the United States of America.” 
Having enjoyed for more than a century an organic existence, a brief 
survey of its internal development during this period will be useful in 
explaining the present status of Hampden-Sidney. 
The first laws framed for the government of the corporation were 
drafted by John Blair Smith, in 1784, at the instance of the board of 
trustees, and, while stamped by the masculine vigor of their originator, 
they are characterized by a simplicity almost primitive in comparison 
with the more refined regulations in force to-day. 
The students were classified as members of the grammar school, 
Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors, who were all subject to the control 
and direction of the president and masters, assistants or tutors. The 
title of professor did not come into use until 1816, when a “ First Pro- 
fessor” was appointed. The Freshman first makes his appearance in 
the collegiate annals in 1812. 
For moral suasion, not so much respect was entertained at Hamp- 
den-Sidney as to exclude occasional recourse to corporal punishment. 
While this mode of correction was reserved mainly for the members of 
the grammar school, the liberties of Sophomores and Juniors were not 
so well defined as to be entirely secure from invasion. The collegiate 
classes, however, had their moral status well hedged in by law at an 
early period, while the members of the grammar school remained sub- 
ject to the more paternal treatment until the school was discontinued 
as a department in 1865. 
A peculiar respect for gravity and decorum was characteristic of the 
old régime at Hampden-Sidney. The president, masters, and stu- 
dents were enjoined to appear at church in “ distinguishing habits of 
black ;” a requirement which, it is needless to say, was soon dispensed 
with. The tutors resided in the college building in order to keep the 
students in proper obedience. The latter were strictly enjoined to re- 
main in their rooms after the hour of nine at night. Attention to moral 
and religious duties was enforced by fines, provisions for which did 
not disappear from the code until 1809. The last of the original laws, 
which exists to-day in its primitive vigor, is the article forbidding 
proselytism. While condemning any tendency in the authorities to in- 
fluence the students in favor of any particular sect, it enjoins the duty 
of respecting that freedom of conviction which belongs to true religion— 
a‘law which has never been violated, and which has received but one 
interpretation within the entire history of the College. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
234 HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA. 
The development of a good curriculum has been gradual, but de- 
cided. In the period of the academy, particular attention was devoted 
to the classics, mathematics, and natural and moral philosophy—studies 
which have always commanded an important place in the curriculum 
of theCollege. To the presidents born before the era of the Revolution, 
the Smith Brothers, Drury Lacy, Archibald Alexander, and Moses 
Hoge, may be ascribed the honor of having kept alive the institution 
of which they were the guardians. Such learning as was taught from 
1776 to 1820 was sound and good; but it was not classified according 
to the approved models of to-day. To a finical modern student, who has 
not examined the methods existing in our collegiate schools of a half 
century ago, the system might appear rude. Assistants and tutors were 
generally appointed during this period at the instance of the president, 
and, as they were always men of the soundest moral and intellectual 
vigor, they were quite as efficient in the discipline of youth, and quite 
as well adapted to impart what was then considered sound learning, as 
many of their historical successors, the professors of our day and gene- 
ration. A tendency to improvement began. under the presidency of 
Moses Hoge, and resulted in a well-regulated and durable system under 
the enlightened administration of his successor, Jonathan P. Cushing. 
With the death of Dr. Hoge, the era of masters and assistants ends, 
and thatof the professors properly begins. ‘The administration of Presi- 
dent Cushing is the most unique, and, in many respects, the most mas- 
terly, in the history of the college. Jonathan Peter Cushing was born 
in 1793, at Rochester, N. H., and at an early period of life was appren- 
ticed as a mechanic. Imbued with a desire to pursue learning, and to 
cultivate the tendencies of a naturally refined and energetic mind, he 
withdrew from his not less honorable but more humble sphere in order 
to become a scholar. Having studied at Phillips Exeter Academy, he 
graduated at Dartmouth College in 1817, and subsequently removed to 
Virginia, where he became identified in early manhood with Hampden- 
Sidney College. As tutor and professor of natural philosophy his ability 
and rare executive talents were discovered. Upon the death of Dr. Hoge, 
Mr. Cushing was elevated to the presidency of the College in 1821. 
About this time professorships in natural philosophy and mathematics — 
were established, followed in quick succession by professorships in liter- 
ature and belle-lettres, Latin and Greek. 
From the conclusion of President Cushing’s administration to the be- 
ginning of the present régime, 1835 to 1883, the names of the successive 
presidents are Carroll, Maxwell, Sparrow, Wilson, Green, and Atkinson. 
During this period the development was in some respects painfully slow, 
although the curriculum as established under Cushing was maintained 
in its entirety. The classical influence had for many years attained a 
supremacy to which it was not legitimately entitled. The curriculum 
at one time seems to have solidified to such an extent as not to permit 
healthful development. The Civil War of 1861-65 tried the institution 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  
HAMPDEN-SIDNEY COLLEGE. 235 
severely, but it survived and incorporated into its course such studies as 
were calculated to impart new life and vigor to the College, and to keep 
it apace with the demands of the age. A professorship of English and 
a systematic course of Bible studies were established. The facilities 
for studying German and French were enlarged, and their importance 
was duly emphasized. Under strict but reasonable limitations elective 
studies were allowed. With these important changes the administra- 
tion of President Atkinson terminated in 1883. 2 
The department of the English professorship embraces English, rheto- 
ric, history,political economy,and logic, a blending of courses which, from 
the view of a specialist, may be subject to many objections; but, as 
different combinations of these branches are pursued during each aca- 
demic year, the elements of each may be taught with some degree of 
precision within the period prior to graduation. This is the germ from 
which a more extended course of history and political science may be 
developed in the future. A recent introduction, indicating the practical 
tendencies of the curriculum, without marring its classical and scientific 
features, was the establishment, in 1886, of a department of commercial 
arithmetic and book-keeping. 
At this pointit may be interesting to mention some of the financial meas- 
ures to which Hampden-Sidney has had recourse in the past in order to 
continue its existence as a literary institution. The original fund for 
erecting the academy was collected by subscription from friends in Prince 
Edward, Charlotte, and Cumberland, and those without the limits of 
these counties who sympathized with the liberal project of old Hanover 
Presbytery. The Presbytery, having been determined in its choice of 
a location for the College by the liberality of Peter Johnston,! of Prince 
Edward, who donated 100 acres of land in this county for the pur- 
pose. of its erection, the foundation of Hampden-Sidney was laid in 
a tobacco-growing section, where currency had but a very limited cir- 
culation, and where, through the peculiar system of land tenure exist- 
ing before the War, no tendency to manufactures was encouraged, and 
the profits to the farmer class continued unreasonably small. Cor- 
dially supported,,from the beginning, by the sympathy and respect of 
the people living in the vicinity, the trustees of the College soon recog- 
nized the necessity of having recourse to more certain sources of reve- 
nue than were promised from the paucity of the currency in the country, 
in order to secure the permanancy ofa literary establishment. While the 
trustees were ever maturing plans for increasing the funds by means of 
private donations, they were not insensible of the privileges offered by 
lotteries, to which, in an emergency, so many institutions resorted for 
aid at that time. In May, 1777, in Virtue of a petition from the board   
1Peter Johnston, of Longwood, was a Scotchman, the friend and correspondent of 
Sir Walter Scott’s father. He was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, and 
was the adjutant of General Lighthorse Harry Lee’s famous legion during the Rev- 
olutionary War., His son Peter was a member of the first class, and was the father 
of General Joseph E. Johnston, of Virginia.

of trustees of Hampden-Sidney, the Legislature permitted a lottery to 
be erected for the benefit of the academy. At a later epoch in the his- 
tory of the College, its guardians approved most highly of the utility 
of lotteries, and not only invested money in the purchase of tickets, 
but passed resolutions, couched in the most complimentary language, 
in consideration of their regard for a donor who gave several lottery 
tickets for the use of the institution. Even so late as 1797, at a meet- 
ing of the board, during which Archibald Alexander, afterwards the 
founder of the theological school at Princeton, was installed as presi- 
dent, a petition to the General Assembly for a lottery to be erected in 
favor of Hampden-Sidney was most gravely approved and recorded. 
The wants of the ‘institution, it is scarcely necessary to remark, were 
not relieved by having recourse to a source which, in time of need, had 
enriched many more fortunate adventurers. 
From 1776 to 1820 the College was enabled to exist through the 
union of the pastoral office with that of president, each successive 
president, after his qualification, being installed pastor of Cumberland 
and Prince Edward churches. In 1803 a ray of hope appeared to pos- 
sess the hearts of the trustees by their petition for aid to the Cincinnati 
- Society. In so low a condition was the state of finances at that time 
that an offer was made to change the name of the College; but the so- 
ciety, not satisfied with so complete a resignation, bestowed its endow- 
ment upon a more fortunate rival. The financial success which was 
finally reaped by the College under the presidency of Cushing, is to be 
attributed, partly, to his rare administrative ability, but more reason- 
ably, perhaps, to the greater ability of the friends of Hampden-Sidney 
at that time to supply her wants. During this administration the ex- 
chequer seemed to have been full to overflowing, in comparison with its 
exhausted state during past years. 
The present college edifice was erected under the happy auspices of 
this era, and, while somewhat defaced by an age of more than fifty 
years, it is still substantially complete, and bears the symmetry and 
beauty of the original design. The first systematic attempt to raise 
a permanent endowment was matured under Presidept Cushing, and, 
_ while the project has been slow of realization, the permanent funds of 
the College have continued slowly toincrease. In 1846 the finances were 
somewhat relieved from embarrassment by the establishment of a sys- 
tem of scholarships. Under Doctor Atkinson’s administration the Col- 
lege was safely brought through the period of civil strife; and while for 
a time enervated by that paralytic shock which no human power could 
avert, she has finally emerged from an apparent state of torpor, and bears 
to-day the same relation to present Virginia which she once sustained 
to the Virginia of the past. The scheme for raising $100,000, as a 
permanent endowment, planned in 1859, has already been more than 
‘realized ; and, while the present resources of the College are incapable 
of supporting her corps of instructors without recourse to the income

arising from tuition, her financial condition is more prosperous than 
at any epoch in her past history. The financial project set afloat 
by the board of trustees during the present administration, to raise a 
permanent fund of $250,000, is being pursued with the same persistency 
which has characterized a continuous effort of more than a hundred 
years. If this plan can be realized, the sphere of usefulness which Hamp- 
den-Sidney has never failed to fill in the past, can be widened and ex- 
tended in the future; although the territory which will most naturally 
patronize her in the future must, in virtue of the educational develop- 
ment in the Southern States, be necessarily more contracted. 
There are two institutions closely connected with Hampden-Sidney 
which, even in this cursory review, claim particular mention. Hano- 
ver Presbytery, in 1808, conveyed to Hampden-Sidney funds for found- 
ing a theological department, the latter simply acting as trustee to exe- 
cute the behest of her venerable mother. Under the administration of 
Moses Hoge, the president performed the duties of professor of theol- 
ogy, although in an entirely separate and distinct capacity. In 1824 
the department was discontinued, and from the germ sprang Union 
Theological Seminary, an institution full of interest to the Presbyte- 
rians of the South. In 1837 a medical department was established in 
Richmond under the control and direction of Hampden-Sidney College. 
From this year until 1850 the degree of M. D. was conferred under the 
seal of the College, at which time the department was discontinued, and 
the former ward, under the name of the Medical College of Virginia, has, 
during a corporate existence of nearly four decades, elevated the science 
of medicine in the State. 
In her relation to the State, Hampden-Sidney has never failed to per- 
form those duties imposed by the terms of her charter, and, while a ma- 
jority in the board of trustees have always been closely associated with 
those pervading influences which have never ceased to flow from the 
parent spring, she is only responsible for the duties imposed by a char- 
ter which renders her absolutely free from the undue influence of any 
denomination of Christians. 
The more distinguished of her alumni have occupied prominent po- 
sitions in church and state, and have been associated with the most 
eminent institutions of learning in Virginia and the South. Those less 
distinguished, but not less honorable, have shown a power of endurance 
ingrained in their natures by a principle transmitted from the academy 
to the College,—that liberty is only valuable when submissive to reason 
and law.

Hampden-Sidney College: Its relation and services to the Presbyterian Church and 
to the cause of education and religion. A discourse preached at the Second Pres- 
byterian Church, Richmond, Va., February 5, 1888, by Richard McIlwaine, D. D. 
From this historical address, by the father of the author of the above sketch, the 
following additional notes are appended by the editor: 
“One of the most interesting pages of American history is to be found in the annals 
of old Hanover Presbytery, and one of its most important features is the concern felt 
and the measures adopted to provide for the scholastic, moral, and religious educa- - 
tion of the youth of the State. At a meeting of this venerable body, held in the 
county of Charlotte, in the year 1774, the subject of Christian education was prayer- 
fully considered, and it was determined to establish an academy for the education of 
youth on the east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. In February, 1775, this institution 
was located in Prince Edward County, was opened for students in January, 1776, and 
the spirit of American independence being abroad in the land, was named Hampden- 
Sidney, after the two English patriots who sealed their love of constitutional freedom 
with their blood. The school was at once filled to overflowing with students, and 
among the first acts of the Legislature of Virginia after independence had been ac- 
knowledged, was the incorporation, in 1783, of Hampden-Sidney College, under a 
charter broad in its provisions and ample in the privileges it conferred. In that in- 
strument these memorable words occur: ‘And that, in order to preserve in the minds 
of the students that sacred love and attachment they should ever bear to the princi- 
ples of the present glorious Revolution, the greatest care and caution shall be used 
in electing such professors and masters, to the end that no person shall be so elected 
unless the uniform tenor of his conduct manifests to the world his sincere affection 
for the liberty and independence of the United States of America.’ 
“It is worthy of remark that the history of Hampden-Sidney has ever been in accord 
with this patriotic declaration. Even during the pendency of the Revolution, its 
students were formed into a company under the command of the president, Rev. John 
Blair Smith, and marched to Williamsburg and placed at the service of the Governor 
of the Commonwealth. So, too, in the war of 1812, the young men, under the com- 
mand of John Kirkpatrick, a late graduate, who was then pursuing his theological 
_ studies under Rey. Dr. Moses Hoge, the president of the college, took part in the de- 
fence of Norfolk, and were for some time in service. And again, in our late War, 
Captain J. M. P. Atkinson, better known to you as my predecessor, led the Hampden- 
Sidney Boys out to the field of conflict in defence of what they believed to be the 
rights of constitutional government. * * * 
“We have at Hampden-Sidney a faculty of six professors, and also a fellow, annually 
elected to give instruction in sub-freshman studies. Our professors are gentlemen of 
marked ability, cultivated scholars, exemplary Christians, and most laborious and 
earnest in the discharge of all their duties. We have over one handred students, the 
sons of our ministers, elders, and christian people, whose general bearing, behavior, 
and studiousness can not be excelled by any similar number of young men. on the con- 
tinent. We have a college building 160 feet long by 40 wide, an excellent structure
-P-A-G-E-277

of solid masonry, which, with some improvements, can be made all that is wanted in 
such a building. Besides, we have a commodious steward’s hall and five professorial 
residences in a fair state of preservation, and in addition we have about two hundred 
and fifty acres of land, on and in the midst of which these buildings stand. 
“ Our endowment amounts to $110,000, and we have a building fund of something 
more than $8,000, which we are now endeavoring to increase in order to erect buildings 
absolutely necessary to the well-being of the college. 
“<Tt will be seen from this statement that we already have a good foundation. Our 
board of trustees has authorized an effort to raise $250,000 in addition, $200,000 for 
permanent endowment and $50,000 for buildings and improvements. 
“As to the location of the college, I may say that I regard it one of the most desirable 
in Virginia. It is in a portion of the State where it is greatly needed; is the only 
institution of high grade in southside Virginia between the mountains and the sea, 
and is in a region proverbially healthful, and distinguished for its moral and relig- 
ious influence. Union Theological Seminary is immediately adjacent, and the inter- 
course maintained between the faculties and students of the two institutions is 
mutually salutary. Our community is composed entirely of the families and students 
of the college and seminary, and can not be excelled for the genial and kindly infiu- 
ence exerted on our young men. * * * 
“Tt was from Hampden-Sidney that the venerable Samuel Doak, one of its first corps 
of teachers, and the founder of Presbyterianism in Tennessee, went forth to establish 
a college across the mountains. He carried on the backs of mules the first library 
‘which was ever on the west of the Alleghanies, before a wagon road had been cut 
across the mountains. From that day to this Hampden-Sidney has been among the 
foremost institutions in the land in furnishing Christian educators for our colleges and 
schools. The largest institution in the South is to-day presided over by a Hampden- 
Sidney graduate, the venerable Landon C. Garland, chancellor of Vanderbilt Univer- 
sity. The present presiding officer at our own State University and another member 
of its faculty are Hampden-Sidney men, and another, the lamented and gifted South- 
all, lately fell at his post as professor of law. Two of our graduates have been presi- 
dents of Davidson College; one a professor of Washington College; one of Washing- 
ton and Lee University; one is now in Richmond College; one in the University of 
Texas; another is the noble chancellor of Central University, Kentucky ; another is 
the founder of the Southwestern Presbyterian University, and now professor of bib- 
lical literature at that institution; another is professor in your own theological semi- 
nary ; five are professors in our own college; and there are many others in colleges 
and at the head of classical and high schools, male and female, throughout the country.”

CHAPTER XVII. 
RANDOLPH-MACON COLLEGE. 
By AUTHORITY. 
Rey. John E. Edwards, D. D., a well-known trustee of the college, 
thus describes the origin of the institution in “A Fragmentary Sketch” 
communicated to the centennial edition of the Randolph-Macon Monthly, 
April, 1882, a magazine which may be regarded as a good source of 
collegiate history : 
“Randolph-Macon College is the oldest Methodist college in the 
United States. Its charter was granted by the Legislature of Virginia 
at the session of 1829-30. The inception or birth-idea of the college 
originated as early as 1828, perhaps earlier, and is traceable to Gabriel 
P. Dissosway, a layman, then living in Petersburg, Va., in consultation 
with Rev. Hezekiah G. Leigh, Rev. John Early, and other leading 
Methodists, ministers and laymen, of that day. At the Virginia An- 
nual Conference, held in February, 1829, before the charter was obtained 
or the name agreed upon, the Rev. H. G. Leigh was appointed college 
agent, to canvass the subject and raise funds for the establishment of 
the institution. It was a new movement, and it encountered, prejudice 
or cold indifference on the part of the preachers and people; but the 
eloquent and earnest appeals of the agent in the field disarmed the 
one and stirred the sluggishness of the other; prejudice and indiffer- 
ence gradually gave way, and in a comparatively short time a general 
interest was awakened in behalf of the new movement that foretokened 
success. The site was selected and the name of the college was agreed 
upon, and measures were put on foot for the erection of the college 
buildings and the inauguration of the institution. As a large portion 
of North Carolina was then embraced in the bounds of the Virginia 
Conference, it was deemed proper and advisable that the college should 
occupy a local position equally accessible both to Virginia and North 
Carolina. Hence the location near Boydton, Mecklenburg County, Va. 
Nathaniel Macon, of North Carolina, and John Randolph, of Virginia, 
were Representatives in the United States Congress from coterminous 
districts—Mecklenburg County being in Randolph’s district ; Macon’s 
district, was just across the State line. Whether it was to avoid a de- 
nominational name for the college, or the hope of securing large dona- 
tions from these distinguished gentlemen in building up an institution

that was to perpetuate their names, that governed the board of trus- 
tees in fixing on Randolph-Macon as the title of the college, I shall 
nct attempt to determine. Ifthe former, it was a blunder; if the lat- 
ter, the hope was disappointed. Neither of these gentlemen, so far as 
Iam advised, ever gave a dollar to the college.” 
The organization and development of the institution are described 
in an authorized article, printed in the Richmond Dispatch, and sent to 
the editor of this report by President W. W. Smith: 
“In October, 1831, the board of trustees elected the first board of in- 
struction, viz, Rev. John Emory, D. D., of New York, president and 
professor of moral science; Rev. Martin T. Parks, professor of mathe- 
matics; Landon C. Garland, professor of natural science; and Robert 
Emory, of New York, professor of languages. The first and last de- 
clined the positions to which they were elected ; the other two accepted. 
One of these, Rev. M. T. Parks, was a graduate of West Point Acad- 
emy. Professor Garland was a graduate of Hampden-Sidney College, 
and at the time of his election a professor in Washington College, Vir- 
ginia. Rev. Stephen Olin, at that time a professor in Franklin College, 
Georgia, was then elected president, and Edward Dromgoole Sims, a 
graduate of the University of North Carolina, was elected professor of 
languages. 
“Dr. Garland survives, now past eighty years, full of honors, filling 
the office of chancellor of Vanderbilt University, Tennessee. He has 
literally and wonderfully gratified a landable ambition referred to in his 
letter of acceptance. He wrote: ‘The only ambition of my life has been 
to devote all my time and talents to the promotion of the welfare and 
happiness of our common country; and that situation which would en- 
able me to do this most efficiently I have ever esteemed most eligible.’ 
“In October, 1632, the buildings for college purposes having been 
partially completed, the doors were opened for the reception of students, 
and regular work commenced. At this time a large proportion of the 
students came from Georgia and South and North Carolina. This con- 
tinued for a number of years, the young men coming by slow stages for 
hundreds of miles, until the Methodist conferences in these States es- 
tablished colleges of their own. 
“Very soon after the inauguration of the college it was determined 
by the board of trustees to make the study of English more prominent 
than it had. been in this or in the colleges generally. To accomplish 
this end Prof. Edward Dromgoole Sims was authorized to spend 
several years in the universities of Europe, making a specialty of the 
Anglo-Saxon and Gothic languages and perfecting his acquirements in 
other languages, classical and, modern. On his return, in 1839, he com- 
menced a course of English instruction, but having found no suita- 
ble text-books in Anglo-Saxon for ‘his classes, he taught them by les- 
sons on the blackboard, at the same time using the classics of the Eng- 
lish language for texts. He was engaged in preparing a regular course 
17036—No. 2——16

of English instruction when his valuable life was cut short by death. 
During Professor Sims’s absence in Europe Rev. W. M. Wightman, of 
South Carolina, filled the chair of ancient languages. He was after- 
wards president of the Southern University, Greensborough, Ala., and 
then was made bishop of the Southern Methodist Church. 
“The first degree was conferred on a graduate in June, 1835. The 
recipient was John C. Blackwell, of Lunenburg County, Va. He was 
a type of a large number of alumni who succeeded him. For over forty 
years, till time and age checked his ardent zeal, he presided over male 
and female schools. 
“TInorder to give permanency to the college, efforts were made from 
the first to raise an endowment for it. This was mainly done through 
agents. One of the first agents was the Rev. John Early, who was for 
many years president of the board of trustees, and afterwards bishop in 
the Methodist Episcopal Church South. He raised a goodly sum for en- 
dowment in 1839, the centennial year of Wesleyan Methodism. This 
work was further continued by the Rey. W. B. Rowzie, now the oldest 
trustee of the college, and its life-long friend. In 1855-56 this endow- 
ment was vigorously pressed to success by the late Rev. Dr. W. A. 
Smith, then president of the college, and Rev. H. B. Cowles, the regular 
agent. They canvassed the State, and succeeded in raising the amount 
to $100,000 in money and solvent bonds. 
“At this period, one marked by great material prosperity in Virginia, 
the college was largely attended. Ina short time the War of the States 
came, which first drew all the older students away, and then put a stop 
to its exercises for about two years. At its close the endowment fund 
was sadly broken up, its libraries and apparatus mutilated by soldiers 
and camp followers, and its halls filled with dust and cobwebs. 
“So great was the desolation and impoverishment of the people, that 
much hesitation was felt by the board in making a new departure, es- 
pecially as during the War the railroad to Clarksville had been destroyed, 
thus throwing the college over twenty-five miles from any railway. 
However, in 1867 the institution was re-opened with a new president, Col. 
Thomas ©. Johnson; Dr. Smith having resigned and taken the presi- 
deney of Ceutral College, Missouri. This effort was not successful for 
many reasons, and the alternative seemed to be forced on the board 
to let the college go down or take steps to change its location, and 
place it where it would be accessible and central to those who were dis- 
posed to patronize it. This was more important from the fact that the 
Baltimore Conference had divided, and that part adhering to the Meth- 
odist Episcopal Church South had become a patronizing conference of 
the college. At a meeting of the board of trustees, held June, 1868, the 
removal was ordered. Ashland, Hanover County, was fixed upon as the 
new location. At this village builéings and a campus were bought, 
which were putin order for professors and students, and in September, 
1868, the institution made its new departure under the new board of

instruction, with the late Rev. James A. Duncan, D. D., president. 
With such an able and popular president, and a faculty composed 
mainly of young and rising scholars, a short period only was required 
to regain its former numbers, which increased till the patronage ex- 
ceeded anything known in its history. 
“Tn 1877 the eminent president was taken away by death, and sev-. 
eral of those associated with him were soon afterward elected to various 
universities. Dr. W. W. Bennett was elected, to fili the vacancy occa- 
sioned by the death of Dr. Duncan, in November, 1877. During his 
presidency all the old wooden buildings first used were removed. In 
their places, besides the literary halls previously built during Dr. Dun- 
can’s life, new and 4vell-arranged halls, lecture-rooms, and a chapel have 
been built, and also new dormitories for students. A more beautiful 
campus can hardly be found anywhere than this. Improvements are 
still going on, and will go on, till all will satisfy the most fastidious 
taste. 
“Itwould be invidious, perhaps, to name individuals when space would 
forbid mention of all the prominent men who have been educated in 
this institution. In the Church they have become bishops, pastors in 
city and country, missionaries to the heathen on this continent and 
others. They may be found in all the Southern States and all the new 
Western States doing faithful work. Many of the highest universities 
and colleges have the. 
“ Randolph-Macon College, though denominational, in that it is sup- 
ported and patronized mainly by one Church, is nevertheless not sec- 
tarian in its course of study. Many young men of other Churches have 
matriculated there who could testify that it is conducted liberally, and 
no proselyting influences are used on students belonging to families con- 
nected with other churches. It does, however, seek to combine relig- 
ious influences with scholastic advantages, believing that learning 
divorced from religion is a dangerous accomplishment to any one who 
receives it, and that such divorcement made general will be injurious 
to the State.” 
Randolph-Macon College has educated hundreds of ministers free of 
tuition fees. There is a regular organization for the aid of deserving 
young men. It is thus doing a work which is of interest and value to 
the State. 
“‘When the college was removed to Ashland and reorganized, the 
‘eclectic’ system was adopted. This was thought to be preferable, 
because the preparation of young men generally was found to be defect- 
ive. Besides, it is claimed that more thorough work can be done un- 
der this system than under the old curriculum system. But students 
are not allowed to choose for themselves without consultation with the 
faculty. Practically, every student has a curriculum chosen for him 
according to the course he wishes to pursue, thus insuring the advan-

tages of the curriculum with the mobility of the elective system. It is 
: found in practice that fully as many take a course leading to A. M. or 
A.B. as under the old system. These two degrees are the most popu- 
lar. The A. B. degree has two courses leading to it, one including 
Greek, the other substituting the modern languages for Greek. With 
proper preparation to begin with this degree can be taken in four years. 
The A. M. course requires longer time. 
“There is also a course of study laid out especially for business men 
requiring three years for its completion. A proud boast of this college 
is that it was the first in the South to establish a course of English 
which should be in every way equal to the classical course.” * 
ENGLISH AT RANDOLPH-MACON. 
Prof. Richard Irby communicated to The State (Richmond, Va.) the 
| following interesting historical statement regarding the origin and 
: development of the English department at Randolph-Macon : 
“The recent discussion of the establishment of a full English course 
in Randolph-Macon College and Richmond College is a matter of too 
great interest to pass by without getting at the full history in the case. 
I therefore give the record as I find it in minutes of the board of 
trustees of Randolph-Macon College. The first item is found in the 
proceedings of the board, June 3, 1836: 
“¢On motion of Mr. Waller [Rev. W. J. Waller] it was unanimously 
Resolved, That we estavlish a professorship of English literature in Ran- 
dolph-Macon College.’ 
“On the next day Rev. Mr. Tomlinson, president of Augusta College, 
Kentucky, was elected to fill the new chair. This gentleman having 
declined to accept the chair, Rev. William M. Wightman, of South Car- 
olina (an A. M. of Charleston College, and afterwards bishop of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church South), was elected in 1837 to the chair, 
and entered on his duties in March, 1838. On the 27th of September 
Professor Wightman resigned the place, and Prof. Edward Dromgoole 
Sims (A. M. of North Carolina University) was transferred from the 
chair of Oriental literature to that of English literature. Professor 
Sims had spent several years in Europe, making a special study of 
Anglo-Saxon and other languages, and returned to the college in 1839, 
“June 19, 1839, on motion of J. Early, 
“¢ Resolved, That as soon as practicable the trustees of Randolph- 
Macon College will establish a normal school as a department in the 
college, in which a good and liberal English education can be obtained, 
and which in its organization shall be especially fitted to educate com- 
mon-school teachers, and that the professor of English literature be ree- 
tor thereof,’ 
“On the same day Professor Sims was permanently appointed pro- 
fessor of English literature. '  
-P-A-G-E-285
RANDOLPH-MACON COLLEGE. - 245 
“At the annual meeting of the board the report of the faculty to the 
board read : 
“<¢ We have had under review the whole course of study and are pre- 
pared to recommend several changes, which have for their object the 
introduction of Anglo-Saxon as a basis for the proper study of English 
literature and language.’ 
“Professor Sims held the chair of English literature for three years. 
During this period he introduced the study of Anglo-Saxon. No text- 
books being accessible, he taught it by exercises on thé blackboard, 
and delivered a series of lectures on Anglo Saxon as a basis of the 
English language. In connection with this language he also had as 
a part of the course the analysis of Milton and other English authors, 
English composition, structure of words, etc. 
“ Professor Sims was elected to a chair in the Alabama University 
in 1842, where he continued his labors in the same line, and was en- 
gaged in the preparation of a series of text-books in Anglo-Saxon when 
he was untimely cut off by death in the midst of his usefulness. His 
successor in the chair of English literature was Rev. D. S. Doggett. 
He not being acquainted with the Anglo-Saxon, this part of the course 
was discontinued, but the other parts were kept up as before. 
“ Referring to the journal, it appears that Anglo-Saxon was again 
introduced into the course by Prof. Thomas R. Price! in 1869-70. Of 
this step Professor Price wrote: 
“¢The president and the trustees of Randolph-Macon College in 
1868-70 deserve, I think, the credit of having made the boldest and 
wisest move in education that has taken place in my time. Dr. Dun- 
can, above all, so great and wise in many directions, was, in my judgment, 
the most deeply devoted and the most far-sighted friend of collegiate 
education that I have known. When made a member of the faculty, 
in 1868, as professor of Greek and Latin, I had, with my large classes, 
to struggle against great difficulties and grave discouragements. Amid 
all I had his tender sympathy and wise and loving help. The funda- 
mental difficulty of all soon revealed itself tome. I was seeking to give 
a knowledge of the ancient languages to boys and young men that 
knew not enough of their own language to receive or to apply it. It 
was irrational, absurd, almost criminal, for example, to expect a young 
man whose knowledge of English words and construction was scant and 
inexact to put into English a difficult thought of Plato or an involved 
period of Cicero. Dr. Duncan, to whom I imparted my conviction of 
the sense of the grave evil, braver and more hopeful than I, bade me 
not to despair, but to cut at the root of the trouble by introducing the 
‘study of English. His eloquence and good sense won thé majority of 
the trustees, and the English school was founded. I had the honor,   
"1 Professor Price was the successor of Professor Gildersleeve in the school of Greek 
at the University of Virginia, and is now professor of English literature in Columbia 
College, New York.—EpiTor.

which I prize highly, of being made professor of English, giving up the 
Latin to Dr. James A. Harrison. I had the duty laid on me by the 
trustees of drawing up the programme of the new course and of select- 
ing text-books and supplementing text-books by lectures. My plan 
was through the course of four years to make the literary and historical 
study of our great language go forward evenly balanced. I began with 
the study of grammar, and of easy texts in the preparatory section, and 
then year after year thus formed in succession the four college classes 
up to the Senior and graduation. To Dr. Duncan and to the good and 
wise men of the board of trustees I am profoundly grateful for having 
used me to carry out the bold and noble design. It was their own 
work, not suggested from the outside, imitating nothing that existed, 
springing from their clear conception of what education meant and 
from their sense of duty to their Church and people.’ 
«The school of English, planned by Professor Price, will be found in 
the catalogue of 1869-70, the second year of the removal of the col- 
lege to Ashland. Omitting a part of the preamble, the following will 
give the design and the scope of the school as laid down in the cata- 
logue: 
“<Tt has, therefore, been resolved to put the study of English at 
Randolph-Macon College on an equal footing with the study of the 
Latin and the Greek. The same thoroughness of instruction will be 
aimed at, the same strictness of method will be enforced. The course 
of study in the introductory and Junior classes will be largely made up 
of English composition. The intermediate and Junior courses will be 
given to English literary history, the historical grammar of the English 
language, and to the Anglo-Saxon and Gothic languages as the sources 
of the English. Distinctions in the school of English as far as the end 
of the Junior course will be required of all graduates of the college. 
Graduation in the full school of English will be required of masters of 
arts and of bachelors of arts.’

PHYSICAL CULTURE AT RANDOLPH-MACON. 
The editor of this report observes that Randolph-Macon College is do- 
ing pioneer work in introducing the new system of physical culture at 
the South, a system based not upon calisthenics or acrobatic perform- 
ances, but upon properly regulated exercises, which are prescribed by 
a competent director to each student after special examination of his 
individual case. Randolph-Macon has appointed Professor Crenshaw 
as director of its new and well-equipped gymnasium. He is a well-edu- 
eated man, one of its own masters of arts, who took a graduate course 
at the Johns Hopkins University, and there obtained his first insight into 
the new system of physical culture. Besides working under Dr. E. M. 
Hartwell, Mr. Crenshaw had also the advantage of Dr. Sargent’s per- 
sonal instruction in the normal course at Harvard University, where 
the newsystem of physical education was first developed in this country. 
. The department of physical culture at Randolph-Macon has been given 
professorial dignity and a position of equality by the side of the other 
departments of the college curriculum. This is as it should be. Physi- 
cal culture has been too long kept upon the level of the prize ring. 
College authorities should appoint educated men instead of boxers and 
acrobats to direct the important work.of physical education, which is 
the basis of good intellectual work. 
LIST OF PRESIDENTS.

signed the presidency, and Dr. William Capers, of South Carolina, was 
elected, but he declined, and Mr. Garland was re-elected) ; Rev. William 
A. Smith, D. D., from 1846 to 1866, a faithful service of twenty years; 
Thomas C. Johnson, A. M., from 1866, upon the reorganization of the 
school after the War, to 1868, when the institution was removed to Ash- 
land; Rev. James A. Duncan, A. M., D. D., from 1868 to 1877 (this emi-

DISTINGUISHED ALUMNI.! 
“ Among teachers the college has representatives of whom she may 
be justly proud. Rev. John C. Blackwell, A. M., of Virginia, the first 
YAmong the graduates of Randolph-Macon who are unknown to fame but yet de- 
serving of honor, is John Lynch Clemmons, Esq., of Louisville, Ky., step-father of the 
Hon. Albert 8. Willis, M. C., from that State. His claim to honorable mention rests 
upon his early anticipation of the idea of the electric telegraph, in 1833, when he was 
yet a student at Randolph-Macon, from which institution he was graduated in 1837. 
The following statement by Mr. Clemmons to a Washington correspondent was pub- 
lished in the Charlotte (N. C.) Observer, March 19, 18386: 
“Tn the spring of the year 1833, when about the age of twenty years, I commenced 
attending lectures on chemistry, and was forcibly struck with the powers of the gal- 
vanic battery, and its connection with electrical currents. In thinking over the 
matter I felt convinced that electricity could be practically used in conveying intelli- 
gence between distant points on insulated wires. I announced this belief to my 
classmates, and to illustrate my idea, drew adiagram * * * exhibiting a wire 
supported by glass brackets on upright poles, such as are now in use, with a bat- 
tery at each end and an independent clock-work on which to receive messages. 
“T attempted frequently to explain this to my comrades, but was only laughed at 
for my pains. I was regarded as a visionary, and my project as a dream. I con- 
tended that it would work, and prophesied that in the near future a man would be 
sitting in his chamber in New York conversing with his brother in New Orleans as 
familiarly as if they were seated at his own fireside. * * * 7 
“In after years a number of my schoolmates came out with voluntary communica- 
tions to different newspapers testifying to what I have above stated. Prominent 
among them was J. W. Cameron, at one time editor of a paper published at Wades- 
boro, N. C. 
“Being young and somewhat diffident, I did not press my suggestions upon the 
public attention; but hearing that a gentleman by the name of Page, in Washington 
City, had become quite eminent as an electrician, I resolved to communicate to him 
my ideas on the subject of telegraphy by the electric current, and to obtain his views 
on the subject. I therefore wrote to him, explaining in detail my views, accompany- 
ing the same with diagrams, etc., and asking him for his opinion. To this request I

graduate, yet lives to reflect honor upon his alma mater. He has spent 
a long life in the work of instructing both sexes, and has had fe w equals 
and no superiors as a careful, capable, and conscientious teacher. The 
following gentlemen are enrolled as graduates on the records of the 
college: Bishop Holland N. McTyeire, D. D.; Rev. John C. Granbery, 
D. D., of Vanderbilt University; Rev. A. W. Mangum, D. D., of the 
University of North Carolina; Richard W. Jones, M. A., of the Uni- 
received no answer. ‘This failure to answer was rather a damper upon my enthusiasm 
and I thought that, after all, probably my theory was not practicable, or its merits 
would have been appreciated by a man eminent in electrical science. 
“T therefore dropped the matter, and devoted myself to my studies, saying but lit- 
tle more about the telegraph. I was preparing myself by a collegiate literary course 
for entering upon my profession as a lawyer, and devoted myself exclusively to that 
purpose. ‘ 
“Years rolled by, and I had almost forgotten the telegraph mat ter, when in the 
year 1844 I opened the Washington Globe one morning, and the first paragraph that 
attracted my attention was an account of the formation of a part nership between 
Page, Morse, Amos Kendall, and Smith, to erect an experimental telegraph wire be- 
tween Baltimore and Washington City, and an application to Congress for pecuniary aid, 
“The moment I saw the combination the conviction flashed upon my mind that 
Page had used my suggestions to him, made eleven years before, in the furtherance of 
the Morse project; and when I learned that at the time I wrote to P age in 1833 and 
for some years afterwards he was an examiner in the Patent Office and forbidden by 
law to take out a patent in his own name, my convictions were confirmed. Indeed, 
I was so positive of the fact that I wrote a communication to the Washington Globe, 
publicly charging Page with having availed himself of my suggestions. 
“Being thus publicly charged with appropriating my suggestion’, he was com- 
pelled to reply to my communication, and did so by admitting that he had eleven 
years before received my letter and diagrams, but excused himself for not answering 
it on the ground that he then thought there was nothing in it. 
“Tn the meantime Morse, Page & Co., having received Congressional aid, proceeded 
to erect their line between Baltimore and Washington, which proved a success, and so 
linked Mr. Morse’s name with the project as to give him the boom over everybody else. 
“Not wishing [continued Mr. Clemmons] to place my reputation for veracity in 
the crucible of public criticism, and caring very little about the matter anyway, I 
remained silent ever afterwards. 
“T should say that the alphabet which I suggested to Mr. Page was precisely the 
same as that which was used by Mr. Morse, and I believe is still used. I have long 
since ceased to give any attention to telegraphy, but take it for granted that itis now 
a very different thing from what it was in the beginning, on account of the numerous 
improvements resulting from experience. 
“Tt is, in fact, hardly proper to say that the electric telegraph was an invention, 
or that it originated with any one man. It wasa growth, not an invention. It com- 
menced with Volta and Galvani, a hundred years ago, and has gradually grown up 
to its present stature. In the years of 1835, 1836, 1837, much attention was given to 
the subject, both in Europe and America. Scientists in England, France, Germany, 
and the United States were working upon the problem in those years. Dr. Jackson 
in Boston, Joseph Henry at Princeton, and others, were studying the subject, and, 
in fact, making experiments in a small way. Doubtless the idea of telegraphing by 
the electric current was original with several different persons, as well as myself. 
Its practical introduction, however, was due to Morse, and he is entitled to the credit 
of having first proved its utility. I think he is entitled to the greater honor, for 
while with others it was mere theory, he put it into practice, and conferred thereby 
its blessings upon the world. I would not pluck a single leaf from the laurel that 
circled his brow, or drop a word that would reflect upon his memory.”

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES. 
President W. W. Smith, of Randolph-Macon, at the opening of the 
year 1887-88 supplied the editor with the following supplementary i in- 
formation: 
“To bring the sketch down to the present date, I would Lak that the 
college is free from debt, and has accumulated $100,000 toward an en- 
_ dowment, in addition to the equivalent of $60,000 in the annual pay- 
ment of $3,600 to its fands by the Church. It is expected soon to in- 
crease the fund to $250,000. The attendance is larger than for twelve 
years, there being 144 present to-day, and we shall probably eatalogue 
about 160, as against 109 last year. Improvement is being made in 
every direction.” 
Concerning the Greek course at Randolph-Macon College, the fol- 
lowing interesting note has been furnished by Professor Richard M. 
Smith, a brother of President W. W. Smith. 
* The professor assigns to each class, in addition to the dub Greek 
work, a course in translations of the best Greek writers. From this the

student. gains what he can gain in no college course by exclusive reading 
of Greek—a moderately good acquaintance with Greek literature. This 
is a new feature, and to it sympathetic and critical attention is invited. 
“Tn addition to this, standard primers on Greek history, literature, 
education, and social and religious life, are studied, and there are given 
on these subjects supplementary talks, taken directly, so far as is pos- 
sible and advisable, from the classic writers themselves. Thus, for in- 
stance, Plutarch is made to lecture upon Demosthenes or Alexander, 
while Demosthenes and Aischines may contend before the class with 
their own speeches. In like manner, every important author mentioned 
in the literature studied is illustrated by a selected reading from his 
own writings. 
“Based on this work there is required in every class an essay, such 
as ‘Homeric Theology and Morality, ‘Contrasts between Greek and 
American Education,’ ‘Socrates,’ and ‘Greek and American Social 
Life,’ 
«<The inspiration of this plan is the belief that God and Christ are in 
history, and that the Greek nation had a great mission for the world. 
The aim of the present course is that the student may be not merely 
trained by the Greek language, but also brought into extensive and 
stimulating contact with Greek life, Greek thought, and Greek achieve- 
ments, and warned by Greek sins and disasters. 
“Another feature of the course is that the student is made acquainted 
with the original form of the documents of what all must admit to be 
the greatest and purest religion, and not only studies them in class, 
but also hears lectures that strive to give him, not a good sermon, but 
all the light that the study of the Greek language and literature casts 
upon the New Testament. This lightis great. It iseasy to find. To 
have it is the desire, not of theological students only, but of every true 
Christian and of every wise man. To give it is the duty of one that 
professes to know and teach Greek. As few young men attend theologi- 
cal seminaries, it is the duty of every complete curriculum to meet this 
need. 
“The course here suggested has been tested by the experience of 
three years. He who has followed it believes it to be good, and hopes 
it will be approved and improved by others.” 
BIBLIOGRAPHY. 
Besides the authorities mentioned in the course of the preceding 
sketch, a good notice of Randolph-Macon College may be found in the 
Appendix to Part I of the Third Annual Report of the Superintendent 
of Public Instruction (Dr. W. H. Ruffner) of Virginia, 1873, pp. 145- 
147. Perhaps the most complete and authentic history of the institu- 
tion is contained in the document written by John Howard, Esq., coun- 
sel for the trustees on the occasion of a lawsuit brought against them 
and testing the right of removal from Boydton to Ashland. This docu- 
ment, or demurrer, contains a full record of all legislation affecting the 
college, and is of great importance.

CHAPTER XVIII. 
EMORY AND HENRY COLLEGE! 
By AUTHORITY. 
About the year 1833-34 the practicability of establishing an institu- 
tion of learning somewhere in Southwestern Virginia or East Tennessee 
that would afford educational advantages of a higher order than any 
then existing that were accessible, began to be discussed. The want of 
a first-class college was felt, especially by the ministry and those in 
professional life. Up to this time the few who wished to obtain more 
than a common-school education were forced to seek it abroad. Ran- 
dolph-Macon, at Boydton, Va; Hampden-Sidney, in Prince Edward 
County, Va. ; and the college at Knoxville, Tenn., were the most avail- 
able. As a class, the preachers in the Holston Annual Conference of 
the Methodist Episcopal Church were doubtless most impressed with 
the need of a first-class vollege. Rev..Creed Fulton, then in the prime 
of his life, a member of the conference, warmly and zealously advocated. 
the enterprise before the conference and in private circles. Under his 
leadership that enterprise soon took definite shape. 
The Holston Conference, at its annual session in the fall of 1835, held 
in Knoxville, Tenn., resolved to establish somewhere in Southwestern 
Virginia what was then called a manual-labor college, an institution 
of learning in which the pupils were to be trained to labor as well as 
think. This manual-labor feature was a very prominent one in the en- 
terprise as it was first brought before the public; a feature that was 
subsequently modified and finally abandoned, for reasons which will be 
noticed hereafter. It is not to be regretted, however, that this feature 
was made prominent in these incipient movements, for the institution 
was to be built up by a people engaged almost wholly in agriculture and 
the mechanic arts; a people among many of whom a prejudice existed. 
against what was considered a learned and lazy race. The conference 
at this session took further steps by appointing Rev. Creed Fulton.as 
general agent to solicit subscriptions, and, with the aid of a committee 
appointed for the purpose, select a location and enter upon the work of 
building. Mr. Fulton hastened to Virginia. The knowledge he had of 
the country, acquired as a travelling preacher, enabled him to select 
wisely and well. The first convention of citizens was ca!led to meet at 
the old Glade Spring Presbyterian Church, in Washington County. 
  
1This college owes its name to Bishop Emory and Patrick Henry, as representatives 
of Church and State in Virginia.

  The fact should be recorded that this first meeting was held in a Pres- 
byterian community, and a subscription was at once made amounting 
to about $5,000. The liberal and generous aid thus given at a critical 
time by the members of one religious denomination to an enterprise of 
this kind inaugurated by another, and intended to be denominational, 
should ever be held in pleasant recollection. Encouraged by this suc- 
cess Mr. Fulton immediately called the committee to meet " Abingdon, 
  where a further subscription of about $5,000 was obtained. Among the 
men of influence who warmly espoused the cause which Mr. Fulton ad- 
vocated, the names of Alexander Findlay, of Abingdon, and Col. Wil- 
liam Byars and Tobias Smyth, citizens of Washington County, should 
never be forgotten. After careful deliberation it was’ decided to locate 
the institution in a beautiful valley nine miles east of Abingdon. This 
valley, watered by a tributary of the Holston, lies just south of the ex- 
treme west end of Walker’s Mountain, and is noted for its beauty and 
fertility. It is 2,000 feet above sea-level. Whitetop Mountain, seen 
twenty miles south, rises 6,000 feet above the sea, The hand of Provi-. 
dence seems to have been in the location of the institution, for through 
this valley, then so secluded, now passes a great railway thoroughfare, 
connecting the East with the West, thus bringing the college, with all 
its beautiful surroundings, into public notice. 
A farm containing about six hundred acres of highly productive land 
was purchased and paid for out of the funds first raised. It was at first 
intended that this farm should be cultivated by student labor, for which 
a compensation was to be allowed which would assist in paying the stu- 
dents’ expenses. This farm, though not long cultivated according to 
the original plan, became subsequently a most valuable appendage, not 
only furnishing in its productions the means of boarding students at a 
low rate, but by enabling the authorities to keep at a distance any popu- 
lation that would be hurtful. This fine body of land was purchased 
from Rev. Edward Crawford, a Presbyterian minister, who we trust, 
true to his calling, had given more attention to the spiritual wants of 
his people than to the cultivation of his farm. The heavy forests were 
unbroken and the fields were overgrown with briars and es while 
the inclosures and buildings were in a state of general dilapidation. 
These conditions all favored an easy purchase of the land, but they 
subsequently sorely tried the temper and patience of the young laborers. 
Plans were drawn for acommodious boarding-house and for the main 
college building. The first was well planned and admirably built, 
meeting well the main purpose for which it was designed; it contained, 
in addition to the large dining hall, kitchen, store-rooms, and steward’s 
apartments, a farge public studying hall, and some dormitories. 
The school was opened April 13, 1838, and one hundred students were 
enrolled the first year under the presidency of Rev. Charles Collins. 
No better man could have been found to take charge of the institution 
in its infancy and start it on its career of usefulness. A man of re-

EMORY AND HENRY COLLEGE 255 
markably clear head, in early manhood, fixed in his purpose and reso- 
lute, with a laudable ambition to succeed, he combined within himself 
rare elements of success, both natural and acquired. 
The students were divided into small companies of eight or ten each, 
and each company placed under the supervision of one of the older stu- 
dents. These companies were taken at two o’clock each afternoon out 
upon the farm to work for two or three hours. They were allowed from 
three to five cents per hour, according to their skill and industry as 
estimated by their leaders. The impracticability of the manual-labor 
system soon became apparent. The farm work could not be done suc- 
cessfully in this way. A hundred hands were to be employed by the 
superintendent for two or three hours; the most of these had never 
been taught to work, and they often did more harm than good. Imple- 
ments and work stock in corresponding numbers had to be provided, 
these to lie idle three-fourths of every day, and often the fields would 
scarcely be reached before the bell would summon them to return, and 
that too often at a time when the care of the crop required immediate 
and prolonged attention. It was soon discovered that a full corps of 
regular hands had to be employed in addition to the students. But 
the students had to be paid for their labor, for the subscribers and 
patrons had been led to expect that in this way a student could meet 
the greater part of his expenses. Board and tuition had to be put at 
scarcely more than a nominal rate. Board was $1.25 per week and tui- 
tion $10 per session of five months. The consequence was that debts— 
an incubus that presses the life out of so many colleges—began to 
accumulate. The fact became apparent that manual-labor institutions 
Jnust be well endowed to insure their success. The system, however, 
was not speedily abandoned, but was persisted in for eight or ten 
years, changing gradually into a voluntary instead of a compulsory 
system. Then, as might have been: anticipated, it soon ceased alto- 
gether. Viewed in another light, the system was by no means devoid 
of advantage. It broke the monotony of ordinary student life; it pro- 
moted health and buoyancy of spirits; in the hours of field and forest 
labor there was found not only relief from study, but such a variety of 
incident, that the students of those days found more means of solid en- 
joyment than others have since. 
The debt alluded to as originating partly at least in the attempt to 
earry out the manual-labor system, continued to exist with gradual in- 
erease until 1843, when it was cancelled by obtaining a loan of $18,000 
from the literary fund of the State of Virginia. It should be stated in 
this connection as a very remarkable fact that, after paying the floating 
debt referred to above, the management of the college was such that 
without a single dollar of endowment or of donations it kept clear of debt 
for the lapse of about thirty years, and that the income from board and 
tuition, both of which were placed at figures unusually low for a first- 
class institution, was sufficient not only to meet current expenses, 
 
-P-A-G-E-296

but to make substantial improvements from time to time, such as 
the building of new and elegant houses and enlarging the library 
and apparatus. The patronage of the college has been drawn almost 
cna from the Southern States, and prior to the Civil War from 
the cotton States. The number of students attending the school, begin- 
ning with one hundred the first year, rose gradually, with slight fluctua- 
tions, to 280 in the year preceding the War. Since the War the number 
has varied from 80 to 150. 
The financial success of the college, in ante-bellum years at least, was 
due largely to the system of boarding. All the students, except day 
students, boarded in acommon hall, where by practising economy, and 
with the help of the farm, a variable surplus was realized each year, 
which was applied to making improvements. Since the War, however, 
the club or mess system has been adopted largely. Now the boarding 
department yields the college no revenue. The more important build- 
ings, added from time to time, have been erected in the following order: 
In 1848 a professor’s house was built at the west end of the campus and 
occupied by Professor Wiley; this building was subsequently enlarged 
and became the president’s house. In 1852a house was erected directly 
east of the one last named, and facing the campus, to be occupied by 
Professor Longley. In the year 1856 the number of students had so in- 
creased that one boarding hall was insufficient, and the building of a 
second became necessary. What is now known as the “Fulton House” 
was then erected on a small elevation northeast of the spring. These 
are all elegant brick buildings. Two additional dormitory buildings 
were erected—one a wooden one-story range on the east border of the 
campus, the other a two-story brick building. The eer pdras of the 
old boarding-house, already alluded to, was immediately followed by 
the erection of a more sightly and imposing building on ground a lit- 
tle south of that occupied by the old one. This college misfortune was 
promptly met by the friends of the institution in the county, mainly by 
a subscription of about $16,000, to erect the new building, which in ar- 
chitectural skill and plan far excels any other on the premises. Several 
objects were happily combined in this structure. Besides all the apart- 
ments necessary for the boarding department, it was arranged so as to 
contain two commodious literary halls, with adjoining libraries, a large 
college library room, a museum and cabinet room, and an observatory 
on a stately tower, which furnishes independent stairways to theliterary 
halls. This building is known as the “Byars House.” As regards 
other changes and improvements, the campus, once bis i to about 
four acres, has been enlarged to twenty-five, and amply supplied with 
shade trees. Among these trees the returning alumnus, after many 
years’ absence, may find the one which his own hands, aided by those

of grass. The college cemetery, now a marked feature in the landscape, 
with its monuments, crowns the northern hill. Here sleep, undisturbed 
by din of battle, more than two hundred soldiers of the Confederacy. 
The building of the railroad through this valley marked an era of im- 
provement in everything connected with it. Itsweeps in a gentle curve 
around north of all the buildings, except the depot, giving the observer 
a pleasing panoramic view of them. On the margin of the college farm 
and half of a mile west of the college, where once grew the chincapin and 
the vine, a quiet, shady vale, well suited for evening walks, now quite 
a village has sprung up, containing some business houses, shops, and a 
number of handsome dwellings. Ona small elevation near by stands 
the residence of Professor Davis. Other beautiful residences have been 
erected in sight on the neighboring farm. The main college building 
has been marked, from time to time, by varying conditions. The ovig- 
inal wooden roof, having been many times on fire, was replaced by one 
of metal. After the War the building was thoroughly renovated inter- 
nally; all the old lathing and plastering were removed and replaced, the 
rooms repaired and repainted. More recently the entire building has 
been painted and pencilled externally, so that its appearance is now fresh 
and attractive. The old college bell, whose tongue was now and then 
stolen, but which continued to call students and faculty to duty for 
nearly forty years, at length succumbed to a crack in its side. In view 
of its associations it was remelted and made part of a new and larger 
one, which now sends its heavy, but melodious tones far over the sur- 
rounding hills. The heavy forests surrounding the college have, to 
some extent, been cleared away, and in their places are cultivated fields. 
These old woods, in days of yore, were ever and anon made vocal by 
youthful orators. This custom still prevails, although the forest area 
is somewhat contracted, and often an approaching anniversary or ex- 
hibition is heralded in this way. Well-graded roads have taken the 
place of the original trail-like pass-ways that radiated in all directions. 
Besides these physical changes to which allusion has been made, 
others of a different kind have been continually occurring, generally, 
as we trust, marking progress in harmony with the spirit of the times, 
though it can scarcely be claimed that these changes have always been 
for the better. 
Comparing the routine of daily duty as prescribed and followed in the 
early years of the college with that practised now, many changes are 
found. Change sometimes is needed simply for the sake of change; it 
breaks the monotonies of life. The first generations of students re- 
member this programme: The morning bell aroused them from slumber 
at 5A.m. In the winter season all as yet was night. The more diligent 
rose at once, kindled their fires, dressed, and set their rooms in order. 
At half past 5 the bell summoned to morning prayers in the chapel. 
This signal roused the laggards from their beds, who hastened, half clad, 
to join their comrades in the dimly-lighted chapel—one tallow candle

usually furnishing the light. After roll call, reading the Scriptures, 
and prayer, during which good order was scarcely expected, some es- 
caped in the dim light to their rooms. From the chapel a large number 
passed directly to the lecture rooms, well warmed and lighted, the re- 
mainder to their rooms; the diligent to their books, and the laggards 
possibly to their beds. Two series of recitations, of thirty minutes each, 
passed before the bell for breakfast rang at 7. At 8 A.M. half-hour reci- 
tations were resumed, which continued until 1, the hour fordinner. At 
2 Pp. M., in the days of manual labor, the companies went to work until 4. 
When the labor feature was dispensed with, the time from 2 to 4 was 
given to study in private rooms. Then duty began on the huge trunks 
of trees which teamsters and oxen had dragged in, and which the students 
cut and carried to their rooms. From the supper table, at 5, they 
passed again to the chapel for evening prayer, at which singing was 
substituted for reading the Scriptures. Then followed the evening 
walks and recreations until 7 Pp. M., then studying until 9, when the 
bell rang for retiring—a signal which many took for ceasing to study 
and not retiring. Thus ended the day. This old system, though ridi- 
culed now as something obsolete and impracticable, had much of merit 
in it, which one might commend without the charge of “fogyism.” It 
encouraged early retiring and early rising, industry, and economy in the 
eareofrooms. In thepresent routine, which is more sybaritic, the morn- 
ing slumber is not broken until 6 o’clock; breakfast at 7, with no reci- 
tation or study hours preceding it. Recitations begin at 8, to which 
forty minutes each are allowed. At 10 A. M. there is a convention of 
all the students, with all the faculty, in the chapel for worship, which 
consists in reading the Scriptures, singing,and prayer. This is a great 
improvement on the old system. It is the usual time for making com- 
munications and announcements to the students and for hearing Senior 
speeches. There is much more of the spirit of devotion, and excellent 
order invariably prevails. The students are not called together for af- 
ternoon prayers. There is no cutting and carrying of wood now as for- 
merly. Coal is used for fuel, and is delivered to the students in their 
rooms, which is far better in point of economy andrisk of damage by fire. 
The ringing of the 9 o’clock bell has been dispensed with, the entire night 
being regarded as sacred either to study or repose. The literary soci- 
eties formerly met in their halls on Friday nights, now they meet on 
Saturday nights. This last change is found to work well. Part of Sat- 
urday was formerly employed in hearing the classes in elocution, now 
the time is allowed for making preparations for debate. On Sunday, 
in addition to the customary service of preaching, etec., much attention 
is given to Sabbath-school work. Bible reading 1s encouraged, a large 
and interesting Bible class being conducted every Sabbath by the pres- 
ident of the college. | 
The changes that have taken place from time to time in the board of 
curators and in the board of instruction will be seen by reference to 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  EMORY AND HENRY COLLEGE. 259 
records where these boards are named. The methods of instruc- 
tion have been modified, but radical changes have been avoided, while 
many of those introduced have been adopted, not so much from a settled 
conviction that they were great improvements over older methods, as 
from a desire to conform to the custom of the times. No substitute for 
mental labor on the part of the student has yet been found to yield 
satisfactory results. The old tread-mill methods of drilling, although 
often now subjects of ridicule, secured a degree of mental discipline 
which no short method, involving merely a passive reception of what is 
taught, can equal. 
In the curriculum of Emory and Henry it is still maintained that 
Latin, Greek, and mathematics should be held as standard studies for 
mental discipline. Much time must be devoted to a patient study of 
the natural, mental, and moral sciences, and the curriculum made yet 
more symmetrical by due attention to the modern languages, specially 
the German and the French; holding the idea as preposterous that any 
one-sided development that nfay be secured by a few weeks’ special 
study of a few branches, intended as special preparation for some par- 
ticular pursuit, can be properly regarded as education. To aid instruc- 
tion in the natural sciences a “Science Hall” has just been erected, 
with lecture-rooms and a laboratory below, and a cabinet of minerals 
and museum above. 
The facilities for boarding students prior to the time of the War were 
limited, at least in variety, being confined almost entirely to the two 
college boarding halls. The usual evils attending such a system were 
manifested—such as coarseness of manners, arising from an absence of 
refined family influences, and dissatisfaction with the fare. After the . 
Civil War a number of family residences were erected in the immediate 
neighborhood, where boarding can now be had, and the students are 
permitted to select any approved place or to board themselves in messes. 
This last method is now quite popular and economical. Companies 
containing fifteen or twenty each take some building, provided by the 
college at a small charge, and elect one of their number to superintend 
their operations and employ a cook. In this arrangement one of the 
evils alluded to above is eliminated. They are never known to com- 
plain of their board. 
In the government of the college and in the administration of disci- 
pline there has been much change. The system now practised would 
have been inefficient in ante-bellum days, nor would the former methods 
be applicable now. These changes have not only been in harmony with, 
but they have been necessitated by, a change in the general charac- 
ter of the students. The old dispensation was emphatically one of law, 
anda rigid enforcement of law seemed to be necessary. The patron- 
age of the school was drawn almost exclusively from slave-holding 
territory. Among the evils arising from the system, a very serious one 
was that it tended to weaken inducements to study, by favoring an idea
-P-A-G-E-300
  260 HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA. 
in the minds of the young men of the dominant race that bids were 
independent, not only of the necessity of manual, but in a measure of 
mental labor. Their relations to the servile race at home did not tend 
to make them specially submissive to wholesome restraints at school ; 
the spoiled favorites of fortune, they were frequently sent abroad be- 
cause they were unmanageable at home. With such boys college rebel- 
lion was a favorite pastime, to prevent which the severest penalties be- 
longing to college discipline were inflicted; such as reproof, pri- 
vate, then public dismission,and expulsion, following these last with 
a publication of the same in the annual catalogue. In former years 
the dominant party was often composed of the worst characters, who 
held the better class in a state of abject fear. The idea was fostered 
that the faculty was one party and the students another, having no 
interests in common; that their stay at college, far from being a 
privilege, was a sort of durance, to which they were subjected con- 
trary to their wishes, and. from which they longed to be delivered. 
To these was added a spirit of vandalism that took delight in muti- 
lating and destroying whatever had been prepared for the comfort 
and welfare of the college community. In all these things there has 
been a most gratifying change brought about, gradually, by many 
different causes. The overthrow of the “peculiar institution” pre- 
pared the way, by bringing our young men to feel that they were de- 
pendent upon themselves for success, and that education was a 
necessity. Much is to be attributed to the changes that have taken 
place in the whole social fabric; to the march of mind and of manners; 
to educational advantages that have been extended to all classes, and 
doubtless a great deal to such influences as have come from the pulpit 
and the Sabbath school. In the school itself much has been done, in- 
dependent of faculty action or influence, to bring about this important 
transformation, inducing a higher and healthier tone of public senti- 
ment among the young men, and giving to the better class a controlling 
power, both by numbers and influence. Among these we notice the es- 
tablishment of the Young Men’s Christian Association, which is becom- 
ing everywhere a power for good. To this may be added the presence 
of a large number of sterling young men in our college community who 
are preparing for the ministry; and, lastly, the influence of the periodi- 
cals published by the literary societies. Whether these in colleges gen- 
erally are productive of good or evil depends entirely on the manner in 
which they are conducted. In Emory and Henry such ae in 
laté years at least, have been managed with surprising skill and pru- 
dence, reflecting great credit on those in charge of them, and by their 
timely suggestions and admonitions giving shape and tone to the senti- 
ments and conduct of the students. In the midst of a body of students 
of this character, students who feel that their interests are identified 
with those of the faculty, there is but little use for so-called “ college 
law.” College law, as well as other law, “ was not made for the right-
-P-A-G-E-301

EMORY AND HENRY COLLEGE. 261 
eous,” and might perhaps be laid aside almost wholly, leaving the 
young men to be a law unto themselves, were it not that still with each 
returning session there are present some few of the baser sort. Rules, 
both general | and specific, however, are always necessary for the efii- 
cient working of every institution of learning, which must be sacredly 
observed. 
A very important feature in the history of Emory and Henry 
College yet remains to be noticed, and that is the origin and work- 
ing of the literary societies, known respectively as the Calliopean 
and the Hermesian. It has been claimed for these that they stand 
unrivalled in their history and operations. They were established prior 
to the year 1840. It would not be doing them justice to say that they 
had encountered no perils and surmounted no difficulties. The boys of 
either crew have sometimes proved their ship among the breakers, when 
the skill of all on duty was put to the test. Working side by side, it 
would have been a marvel indeed if they had never been antagonistic ; 
the great wonder is that their relations have generally been so emi- 
nently pleasant and their intercourse marked by so much of reciprocal 
courtésy. Olub-like in their character when first organized, without 
libraries or equipments, they held their meetings in the lecture-rooms. 
In the course of two or three years, however, they fitted up the attics 
in the wings of the main college building as halls. These were small, 
with ceilings low and means of ventilation imperfect, but they were 
rendered very attractive. Indeed, the ornamentation seemed to be in 
an inverse ratio to the fitness of the apartments otherwise. Limited in 
space for their operations as these societies were at that period, and 
subjected to inconveniences of various kinds, it is, nevertheless, ques- 
tionable whether the god of eloquence and the queen of the muses were 
ever more lavish in bestowing success on their votaries. Indeed, the 
reputation which Emory and Henry has borne as a school eminently 
successful in elocutionary training was well established at this time. 
In the building of the Byars House, in 1858, by special contract with the 
literary societies, the third story was built and devoted solely to their 
use, affording two halls, each about 40 by 50 feet, with lofty ceilings, 
and sufficient space for libraries contiguous to each hall, and separated. 
therefrom by arched doorways and glass partitions. A large collection 
of books had been made by each society, by purchases and otherwise, 
before they entered their new halls, but with new library apartments 
and ample space a spirit of rivalry sprang up which has resulted in 
large collections. The equipments of these halls are such as to make 
them highly beautiful and seemingly verging on extravagance, but as 
each generation of students has contributed only a part, the expense 
has been easily met. In the main they have been wonderfully free from 
internal feuds and schisms or party strife. The happy exception they 
enjoy from such evils is due largely to the fact that secret organiza- 
tions are not allowed to exist as such in the college. A generous 
rivalry between these literary societies, with other good results, has 
 
-P-A-G-E-302

modified the bearing of the older students towards new rodrdit The 
unkind treatment of new students, technically known as “ hazing,” in 
some colleges, is here considered ungentlemanly and is practically un- 
known. The manly and business-like way in which the affairs of these 
societies are conducted would surprise any one not familiar with them. 
By inspecting the faculty record it may be seen that four members 
thereof were officially connected with and worked together as colleagues. 
for twenty-four consecutive years, while three of these were thus united 
for thirty-four years, and two of them are still thus associated, After 
a lapse of more than forty years we know of no other institution that 
can exhibit such a record. It indicates great steadiness in the work- 
ing of the machinery and great harmony among those placed in charge 
of it, both of which are essential to success in operations of this kind. 
In later years, when similar institutions became more abundant, when 
competition became active and a struggle for existence began through 
lack of patronage, some changes were made which restored the confi- 
dence of the people in the college, and stirred them up to retaining the 
great school in their midst. | 
In the half century now closing on the history of the institution it has 
run a career of prosperity and usefulness surpassing the most sanguine 
expectations of its founders. If the career of Emory and Henry should 
end even now, our whole country should rejoice in the good it has already 
accomplished. It has proved a blessing to the country and to the 
church, such as has abundantly repaid all it has cost of ete and treas- 
ure. It has already aided in educating 5,200 young men; it has gradu- 
ated more than 500. Of these graduates over 200 have belonged to the 
State of Virginia, more than 100 to Tennessee, and 31 to North Carolina, 
while all the other Southern States have been well represented. It has 
provided first-class teachers for high schools and colleges, while five 
universities are partly manned by its graduates. Our records show, in 
part at least, to what extent the pulpit and the bar, the editorial chair 
and the healing art, legislative bodies and our Congress halls, have 
been supplied with efficient men from these academic shades. 
At a special meeting of the Joint Board of Trustees and Visitors of 
’ Emory and Henry College held on July 18, 1888, Major R. W. Jones, 
of Mississippi, was elected president of the college and professor of 
chemistry, mineralogy, and geology, to fill the vacancy caused by the 
resignation of President Jordan. Mr. E. B. Craighead, of Missouri, 
was elected professor of Latin and French: The oa stands 
as follows: R. W. Jones, M. A., LL. D., president; Rev. E. E. Wiley, 
D. D., treasurer and financial agent; Rev. Edmund Longley, M. A., 
professor of moral philosophy and English; Rev. James A. Davis, M. 
A., professor of natural philosophy, astronomy, and botany; George W. 
Miles, Jr., M. A., professor of Greek and German; Samuel M. Barton, 
Ph. D., professor of pure and applied mathematics; R. W. Jones, M. 
A., LL. D., professor of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology ; HE. B. 
Craighead, M. A., professor of Latin and French.

CHAPTER XIX. 
ROANOKE COLLEGE. 
By tHE EpIToR. 
There is a short historical account of this institution in Dr. William 
H. Ruffner’s Third Annual Report of the Superintendent of Public 
Instruction, 1873, pp. 148, 149, in which attention is called to the orig- 
inal design of the college in the valley of the Roanoke. It was “for 
the especial benefit of the Anglo-German population of Virginia, who, 
to a great extent, then [1853] constituted the industrious, rural people 
of the valley counties and other parts, mostly of West Virginia, who 
from different causes, to a very limited extent, patronized the old estab- 
lished institutions of the State.” 
Roanoke College was the historical outgrowth of a private Lutheran 
foundation called the Virginia Institute, established within the limits of 
the Mt. Tabor congregation, in Augusta County, by the Rev. David F. 
Bittle and the Rev. C. C. Baughman, in the vear 1842.. The institution 
was adopted by the Virginia Synod of the Lutheran Church in 1843, and 
in 1847 it was removed to its present site, Salem, in the Roanoke Valley. 
The Virginia Collegiate Institute was chartered as Roanoke College in 
1853. The college is characterized in the original charter as “ A seminary 
of learning for the instruction of youth in the various branches of science 
and literature, the useful arts, and the learned and foreign languages.” It 
was distinctly asserted that nothing in the charter should be ‘so con- 
strued as at any time to authorize the establishment of a theological pro- 
fessorship.” Although remaining under the auspices of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church, the institution has always been conducted in a most 
catholic spirit, and has largely drawn both its students and its support 
from non-Lutheran sources. About two-thirds of its present constitu- 
ency come from other denominations. As indicative of the liberal tend- 
encies of the college, it is stated that Roanoke College had representa- 
tives at seven theological seminaries in 1886-87—Lutheran (Gettysburg 
and Philadelpbia), Presbyterian (Onion, N. Y., and Princeton), Episco- 
palian (Alexandria), Congregational (Yale), and Baptist (Louisville, 
Ky.). 
The sources of information concerning the historical development of 
Roanoke College are few and scattered. Probably the most authentic 
are the historical articles of the late President Bittle, the first president 
263, 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  264 HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA. 
and virtual founder of the college, contributed to the Bhshoke Col- 
legian, of which a bound set is preserved in the Roanoke College li. 
brary. A memorial address delivered by 8S. C. Wells, Ph. D., at the 
opening of the Bittle Memorial Hall, Roanoke College, Salem, Va., Oc. 
tober 17, 1879, and printed in the Lutheran Quarterly for Uctober, 1880 
(Gettysburg), contains an excellent sketch of Dr. Bittle’s! life-work as 
the builder of a good institution of learning on an educational frontier. 
The following scattered notices of the college have been gathered from 
various sources, but all have the sanction of President Julius D. Dreher, 
the energetic head of a hopeful college. The first notice is taken from 
the Journal of Education, Boston, June 30, 1887, which appears to be 
one of the most recent authoritative statements: 
“Tn the Virginia mountains there is no spot more healthful than the 
Roanoke Valley, which lies between the Blue Ridge and the Allegha- 
nies, at an average elevation of 1,100 feet above the sea-level. That it 
is a valley of wonderful beauty also may be seen from the accompany- 
ing cut, which was made for the Century Magazine when Edward King 
was writing ‘The Great South’ papers for that popular monthly. Itisa 
region much like the Wyoming, in Pennsylvania, the valley being small 
enough to be seen at one view from an elevation, together with the out- 
line of the mountains that completely encircle it. It bears a striking 
resemblance to the lovely valley in which Williams College is situated. 
When Rev. George Miiller, of Bristol, England, visited Roanoke in 1878 
to address the students, he remarked that the scenery around Salem 
strikingly reminded him of Switzerland. Mr. Charles Dudley Warner, 
Rev. Washington Gladden, D. D., LL. D., Dr. A. D. Mayo, and many 
others, have also written descriptions of the picturesque beauty of the 
valley of the Roanoke. * * * 
“The Virginia Collegiate Institute, which was catupiilibed in Salem 
in 1847, was erected into Roanoke College by act of the Legislature of 
Virginia in 1853, the charter vesting the government of the college in 
a self-perpetuating board of trustees. There was little except the char- 
ter to entitle the institution to the new dignity assigned. A brief his- 
torical sketch of those early days of the college informs us that— 
“<¢Cresus did not stand sponsor at its baptism, nor the Roanoke, as 
another Pactolus, stand ready to convert its ventures into gold. * * * 
The library at this time consisted of 140 volumes; the’ grounds and 
buildings were worth about $10,000, with liabilities of about $8,000 
resting upon them; and willing hands and hopeful hearts kept watch 
and ward over the financial and academic interests of the rising insti- 
tution in the prayerful hope that the blessing of Heaven would continue 
to attend the new enterprise.’

Lutheran Church, of Richmond, October 8, 1876, by W. H. Ruffner, Superintendent of

“Harnest work, done at great personal sacrifice, by an overworked 
and underpaid faculty, has marked every step in the onward movement 
of Roanoke College. Only fairly started when the Civil War was begun, 
its doors were nevertheless kept open throughout that dark period; and 
the college bell rang its daily call to peaceful tasks while the music of 
the bugle and the drum was heard on many a tented field. <A true pict- 
ure of the shifts resorted to and the sacrifices made to carry on the 
college during that trying time would reveal various lights and shad- 
ows—much that was amusing—to offset an otherwise too sombre back- 
ground. Scarcely had the War ended before an agent was in the field 
to collect money to erect an additional building; the enlarged main edi- 
fice and the west hall proving altogether inadequate to meet pressing 
demands. 
“The small library was increased from year to year until a building 
for its accommodation became a necessity. Through the generous gifts 
of friends North and South the trustees were enabled to erect such a 
building in 1879. It is substantially built of brick—as are all the 
college buildings—and is called the ‘ Bittle Memorial,’ in honor of the 
first president of the college. The library now contains about 16,000 
volumes, many of the books being rare and valuable, and a number of 
them from 200 to 400 years old. 
“ Following the example of the University of Virginia, many colleges 
in the South have arranged their studies into schools instead of courses. 
Roanoke College adheres to the historic classification of Freshman, 
Sophomore, Junior, and Senior classes, but allows a choice among sev- 
eral courses for degrees. | f 
“Roanoke College has always manifested a warm interest in the ad- 
vancement of popular education and in preparing well-qualified teach- 
ers for various grades of schools. Up to the year 1865 the college grad- 
uated only 41 men. The results the institution has achieved have been 
* accomplished almost entirely within the brief period of a little more 
than two decades. The whole number of graduates now aggregates 
nearly 300, the majority of whom are engaged as professors, teachers, 
and clergymen. Graduates of the college may be found in almost every 
profession and in connection with leading business interests in twenty- 
seven States and Territories. . | 
“Owing to the want of means and to irregular preparatory training 
@ great many students in the South pursue only a partial course at col- 
lege. Of this class Roanoke has received fully one thousand. As 
‘ many of these are pretty well educated, and as no inconsiderable num- 
ber of them oceupy prominent positions in professional and business 
life, the college may justly claim large consideration for them in mak- 
ing up any estimate of its usefulness to the country. 
«<The college draws its students from every Southern State and from 
some parts of the North and West. At different times young men have 
come from Mexico. For sixteen years Roanoke has been educating In-

dians. The Choctaws support a small number of students at the col- 
lege at the expense of their government. Three Choctaw superintend- 
ents of schools have visited the college in the discharge of their official 
duties. In 1883 William H. McKinney graduated at Roanoke with the 
degree of A. B., being the first Indian to take a diploma at a Virginia 
college, and also the first one to win that honor at Yale University, 
where he was made a bachelor of divinity in 1886. 
“The history of Roanoke College corresponds in general to that of 
Yale up to the year 1831, when the first endowment fund of $100,000 
was raised for that University, but more nearly with the story of the 
earlier years of Amherst, as told by Prof. W. 8. Tyler in his history of 
that institution. It must be borne in mind that Roanoke College is only 
thirty-four years old, including the War period; that the years since the 
‘War have not been favorable to the building up of a struggling institu- 
tion; that the college has never received even the smallest appropria- 
tion from the State; and that, although five bequests have been made to 
t, the college has as yet very little endowment—four of these bequests, 
left by friends in Virginia, not being yet available.’ It is surprising 
that the college has lived; it is still more surprising that it has made 
so good a record for sound scholarship and for wide usefulness. How 
this work has been accomplished need not be told here in detail. Any 
one at all familiar with the difficulties of establishing good colleges, 
even in wealthy communities and under favoring conditions and influ- 
ences, can fill up this outline with years of burdensome work on meagre 
salaries, with earnest devotion on the part of faculty, students, and 
friends, and, above all, with love to humanity and faith in God. 
“The college owes much to the unflagging energy and self-sacrificing 
spirit of its first president, Dr. D. F. Bittle, who gave to it twenty three 
years of constant and laborious service [from 1853 to 1876].” 
Speaking of this man, Dr. A. D. Mayo, associate editor of the Jour- 
nal of Education, Boston, in an editorial on “ Roanoke College,” says: 
«The true existence of the institution began with its first president, 
Dr. Bittle, who for more than twenty years toiled like a Hercules against 
every obstacle to establish a centre of good learning for the people of 
his religious connection. Around him grew up a corps of teachers 
worthy of such a leader, two of whom are still among the present fac- 
ulty. The school slowly grew, kept itself alive during the War, and 
now, at the end of its first generation, is able to make an honorable show 
of past service. In this time it has received more than 1,000 and gradu- 
ated nearly 300 students, the majority of young men of that substan- 
tial and vigorous sort on whom the future of every Southern State so 
largely depends. It has received students from some twenty States of 
the Union, and its name is cherished in every part of the South.   
1Since this was written a bequest of real estate (valued at $10,000) has become 
available by the death (October 11, 1887) of the widow of the donor. Col. G, B. Board, 
president of the board of trustees, died recently, leaving the college $10,000 for en- 
dowment, already well invested.

“ Our four days’ acquaintance with these young men, their professors, 
and the large number of visitors from the adjacent country, convinced 
us that President Dreher has not over-rated the importance of this 
fortress of the new education in new Virginia. With one exception 
Roanoke College is the only institution of the sort in a region as large 
as the State of Maryland, which is rapidly coming into notice as the 
mining, metallic, manufacturing, and cattle-grazing portion of the State. 
The new iron town of Roanoke is only seven miles away, and the whole 
country is alive with the omens of bright promise for anear future. It 
will be a great advantage if this young institution can offer, at its pres- 
ent moderate rates, a thorough college education to large numbers of 
the active young men of such a district.” 
Mr. Charles Dudley Warner, in his editorial ‘‘ Notes on Virginia,” in 
the Hartford Courant, July, 1883, says: “‘ Roanoke College is animated 
by the modern spirit, has put the past behind it, and is keenly alive to the 
importance of the right surt of educational training for the new Virginia. 
There is nothing more important, just now, for the South, than the thor- 
ough educational training of the so-called middle class. Only by this 
means can it keep step with the great industrial movement of our 
time. In tone and standard the college is good, its students are there 
to learn, and the results, according to its means, are satisfactory. But 
it is an institution peculiarly happily situated to tell upon the new 
awakening life of the South, and no amount of money would be thrown 
away on it. I thought while we were there, in the midst of so much . 
agricultural richness, with the mineral wealth opening up, and such 
signs near at hand of a vast industrial development, that here is just 
the place for a grand industrial scientific school, which would proba- 
bly tell more than any other one agency on the development of the 
resources of Virginia.” 
Rev. Washington Gladden, D. D., LL. D., in a communication to the 
Springfield (Mass.) Republican, June 27, 1882, said: 
“A large share of the students are from the middle class, and the 
spirit of the work and of self-reliance manifested by them is truly in- 
spiring. In the baker’s dozen of speeches by these young men in the 
contest for the prize medal in oratory, and on the commencement stage, 
there was a revelation of the temper of the new South that bodes noth- 
ing but good to that section and to the whole nation. Without excep- 
tion, the speeches were brave, manly, forward-looking. The fact that 
a new day had come to the South was the undertone of all this young 
thinking; and it was evident enough that these hopeful fellows were 
ready to spring to the front of the new movement, and make the most 
of its opportunities. National matters were referred to by most of them, 
and not: one word of bitterness was spoken, nothing that could have 
given pain to the most stalwart Northerner. In a literary way, the 
speeches were much more rhetorical than would be heard at Yale or 
Amherst, and some of them needed not a little chastening ; but what

they lacked in finish they made up in manliness. On the whole, | was 
greatly pleased with the indications given by the young men of this 
college, representing several different States, of the public sentiment at 
the South.” 
PROFESSIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF ALUMNI. 
The triennial catalogue of the alumni of Roanoke College gives the 
names, occupations, and residences of the graduates of Roanoke Col- 
lege. It shows that at the close of its thirty-fourth year the college 
had graduated 278 men, of whom 261 are living. We give the distri- 
bution of the whole number (278) by professions and States. 
By professions: Presidents, principals, professors, and teachers, 67 
(of these 20 are clergymen) ; clergymen, 61; attorneys-at-law, 48; mer- 
chants and in general business, 23; agriculturists, 22; physicians, 20; 
editors, 4 (six clergymen and teachers are also engaged in editorial 
work); bankers, 4; civil officers, 3 (not counting lawyers who hold 
offices or graduates who are members of State Legislatures); United 
States Civil Service, 3; officers in United States Army, 1; missionary 
in Mexico, 1; studying in Germany, 1; unclassified, 20 (including a num- 
ber of recent graduates). In this classification graduates preparing for 
a profession are counted as being already in it. 
By States: Virginia, 135; North Carolina, 19; Texas, 18; Pennsyl- 
vania, 13 ; Maryland, 12; West Virginia, 9; South Carolina, 9; Ten- 
nessee, 8; Kentucky, 7; Mississippi, 6; New York,5; Louisiana, Cali- 
fornia, and District of Columbia, 4 each; Alabama and Indian Terri- 
tory, 3each; New Jersey, Ohio, Missouri, Colorado, and Nebraska, 2 
each; Georgia, Arkansas, Illinois, lowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Utah Ter- 
ritory, Mexico, and Germany, 1 each. This shows that the graduates 
ot Roanoke are laboring in twenty-eight States and Territories and two 
other countries. 
In so brief an analysis it is not possible to enumerate the prominent 
positions filled by Roanoke graduates. In estimating the work done 
by the college we must keep in mind the fact that, besides the grad- 
uates, nearly 1,500 students have taken a partial course at Roanoke, 
and that many of these fill prominent positions in professional and busi- 
ness life. When it is borne in mind that Roanoke College has done its 
work with almost no endowment and under many disadvantages, its 
faculty and friends certainly have good reason to be gratified at what 
has been accomplished. (Roanoke Collegian, July, 1887.)

of Education, by F. V. N. Painter, A. M., professor of modern languages 
and literature. (International Education Series. New York: D. Apple-

  : CHAPTER XxX. 
RICHMOND COLLEGE. 
By ProFrssor H. H. HARRIS, 
Chairman of the Faculty. 
Enduring institutions are commonly the result of slow growth, and 
that often from small beginnings. So it has been with Richmond Col- 
lege. In common with nearly all other seats of Christian learning, it 
owes its foundation to the desire for a better educated ministry. 
ITS ORIGIN. 
On the 8th of June, 1830, a few devoted men, who had gathered in 
Richmond for their General Association, met in the Second Baptist 
Church at 5 o’clock, A. M., ‘to devise and propose some plan for the 
improvement of young men who, in the judgment of the churches, are 
called to the work of the ministry.” The slender means at their com- 
mand were but as the faint light of the sun just rising upon them in 
comparison with the strength and beauty that were to follow. They 
organized the “Virginia Baptist Education Society,” and for two years 
aided approved young men by placing them in private schools, nine 
with Elder Edward Baptist in Powhatan County, four with Elder Eli 
Ball in Henrico. 
In 1832 the society bought Spring Farm, a small tract some four miles 
northwest of the city, and there, on the 4th of July, opened a manual- 
labor school called the “‘ Virginia Baptist Seminary,” with Rev. Robert 
Ryland teacher, and 14 students. During the second session, which be- 
gan in February, 1833, the number of students ran up to 26, about two- 
thirds of them preparing for the ministry, the rest for other vocations. 
The course began with arithmetic, geography, and grammar, and, run- 
ning through four years, embraced algebra and geometry, Latin and 
Greek, natural and moral science, with theology as an optional study. 
All the classes yet formed were taught by Dr. Ryland and Rev. Fli Ball. 
In December, 1833, the seminary was removed to the site now held 
by the college, just within the present limits of the city, though then 
in the western suburbs, half a mile beyond the corporation lines. To this 
purchase of nine acres six more were added in 1836, making a location 
which was well described as “combining healthfulness, beauty, and con- 
venience.” The design in adding more land was to give larger scope 
271
-P-A-G-E-314
EE EEIETEI ee 
272 HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA. 
to the manuai-labor feature of the school. This was strenuously insisted 
on by the authorities, as giving to the needy opportunities for self-help 
and to all healthful exercise, but it proved unpopular with the students. 
The hours of daily labor were reduced from three to two, and finally, 
as we read in the report for 1841, ‘‘this feature of the seminary has been 
gradually fading from view, until (like all similar institutions in our 
own and other countries) it has been virtually abandoned.” 
The records of the seminary during the ten years of its existence 
under this name are unfortunately incomplete. The attendance grad- 
ually increased to more than seventy pupils. The corps of instructors 
consisted of Dr. Ryland and two tutors. Dr. Ryland had leave of absence 
for one year to accept the chaplaincy of the University of Virginia. 
Among the assistants were William F. Nelson, F. W. Berryman, Caleb 
Burnley, R. A. Claybrook, Elias Dodson, I. G. Barker, J. C. Clopton, 
S. C. Clopton, George Struve, and Charles L. Cocke—the first and last 
named served a number of years, the others for shorter periods. Thefirst 
class to finish the course went out in 1836, four in number—William I. 
Chiles, Elias Dodson, A. P. Repiton, and John O. Turpin—three of whom 
have recently died, after eminent and useful lives as ministers of the gos- 
pel. Three others, who should have been with them, had left school to go 
as foreign missionaries—William Mylne to Africa, R. D. Davenport to 
Siam, J. L. Shuck to China. The classes which followed year after year 
were not unworthy of this first one, though they were constantly thinned 
by the withdrawal of young men eager to enter active life or to secure 
elsewhere the advantages of a fully-equipped college. 
CHANGE OF NAME. 
By Act of Assembly, passed March 4, 1840, thirty-seven gentlemen, 
therein named, were incorporated as trustees, to establish, “at or near 
_ the city of Richmond, a seminary of learning for the instruction of youth 
in the various branches of science and literature, the useful arts, and 
the learned and foreign languages, which shall be called and known by 
the name of Richmond College.” The charter conferred ample powers, 
and allowed the purchase of the property of the Education Society, but 
provided “that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to 
authorize the establishment of a theological professorship in the said 
college.” This proviso, according to authentic tradition, was inserted 
at the request of an eminent brother and influential member of the Leg- 
islature who was selected to offer the bill—Col. Edmund Broadus, of 
Culpeper; without it there would have been difficulty in getting a charter 
at that time. It was omitted from the amended charter of 1858, under 
which the college is now working. 
The trustees spent two years in perfecting their plans and trying to 
raise means to carry them into effect. The work fell mainly to the lot 
of their president, Dr. Ryland, and his rare candor and supreme scorn 
for all shams made him unwilling to call the school a college until 1t
-P-A-G-E-315
a p-nesae FE Gabbage RRL Se: ee a a a i A ae es ee ee ee a oe oe 
RICHMOND COLLEGE. 273 
could do real collegiate work. The terms of transfer agreed upon in 
1841 were, (1) that the college should admit free of charge, except for 
board, all ministers and candidates for the ministry who may be recom- 
mended by the Education Society or its board of managers [by common 
consent this has been extended to all such persons whether recom- 
mended by the society or not]; (2) that in case of failure to continue 
the institution, or to comply with the foregoing stipulation, the property, 
or its estimated value, $20,000, should revert to the Education Society ; 
(3) that any vacancy in the trustees shall be filled from a list of not less 
than ten persons, named by the society, if it shall in due time furnish 
such list; and (4) that the transfer be made only after a permanent en- 
dowment of $50,000 had been secured. This last condition was with- 
drawn the next year, because, said the society, “ we think that it will 
facilitate the collection of funds to change the institution at once intoa 
college, and to conduct its operations in strict accordance with its re- 
sources.” And so, on the Ist of January, 1843, grounds and buildings 
worth $20,000, a library of 700 volumes, 3 teachers, at salaries of $900, 
$600, and $500, and 68 students, 21 of them beneficiaries, were turned 
over from the care of a voluntary denominational society to the control 
of the legally incorporated trustees of Richmond College. The Educa- 
tion Society has continued its work of aiding young men recommended 
by the churches, in co-operation with it, in preparing for the ministry, 
by making arrangements for their board, leaving the care and the cost 
of their tuition to the college. 
SECOND DECADE. 
In 1842 we had a principal and two tutors, working ten months, at fixed 
salaries, with 68 pupils, divided into four classes, two-thirds of them 
engaged in preparatory studies; in 1851 we had a president and three 
full professors, paid partly from endowment, partly by tuition fees, a 
nine months’ session, and 76 students, no longer classified as Fresh- 
men, Sophomores, etc., but ‘admitted to any classes they are pre- 
pared to enter, and allowed to pursue the studies they may desire to 
prosecute.” The steps by which these changes were introduced are too 
full of interest to be entirely omitted even in a brief sketch. 
The principles which the youthful institution adopted for its guid- 
ance are shown in these memorable words, printed in the catalogue of 
1842-43, and republished for several successive years : 
‘“ As the trustees are determined to avoid pecuniary embarrassment, 
they propose to conduct the college classes only so far as their resources 
may justify, taking care to have the students thoroughly taught as far 
as they shall go. It is not their purpose to confer degrees till they shall 
have afforded facilities for education equal to those of other chartered 
institutions. As the patronage of the community, and the proceeds of 
an endowment now being raised, shall increase their means, they will 
17036—No. 2——18
-P-A-G-E-316
    
274 HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA. 
continue to add to their corps of instructors, until they shall have pro- 
cured a faculty sufficient to conduct the classes through the ordinary 
collegiate course. * * * Itis far better to proceed cautiously—to 
live within our means—and to rise gradually, but surely, than by affect- 
ing a premature prosperity, to plunge the enterprise into the vortex of 
ruin.” 
In accordance with these principles additional professors were chosen 
only as the progress of the endowment would allow. Dr. Ryland, 
who had been professor of ancient languages, took, in 1845, the chair of 
_ moral science, which he continued to fill till 1861. George Frederick 
Holmes, now of the University of Virginia, filled the chair of ancient 
languages, 1845-47, and was succeeded by Heath Jones Christian. 
Charles L. Cocke, now of Hollins Institute, appears first as tutor, then 
as instructor in mathematics, and upon his resignation, in 1846, he was 
succeeded for three years by Thomas Bolling Robertson, then by John 
Lawson, and in 1850 by Lewis Turner, as professor of mathematics. S. 
C. Clopton, second tutor, went out as a missionary to China, and his 
duties as teacher in the academic department were devolved on John 
M. Murray for two years, S. E. Brownell one year, N. H. Massie two 
years, T. L. Snead one year, and B. Puryear one year. The academic 
department ceased for a time at least to have any separate existence 
upon the election of Mr. Puryear, in 1850, to the professorship of natural 
sciences. This chair had its beginning three years before in the ap- 
pointment of N. B. Webster as lecturer on natural science. Mr. Turner 
was elected to the chair in 1849, but soon found that an exchange with 
Mr. Puryear would be better for all parties. For instruction in French 
provision had been made year by year with Messieurs Ansman, Guillet, 
Odenhall, and Michard, and in 1849 by the election of Prof. Arthur 
Frise, who, however, held the chair only one session. The division of 
tuition fees among the faculty was first made in 1849 “in proportion to 
the relative salaries they at present receive.” 
Up to 1842 the students were divided into four classes, as in the be- 
ginning of the seminary. From that time the third and fourth were 
designated as Freshman and Sophomore. In 1845 a Junior class was 
added, and in 1848 a Senior. During all these years, however, the 
proportion of irregulars, or students pursuing a select course, was con- 
stantly increasing, and every facility for such selection was provided. 
So that the year 1849, which witnessed the first award of the degree of 
bachelor of arts, saw also the abolition of the curriculum, and the sub- 
stitution of a system of classification and advancement in each study 
according to the students’ abilities and attainments. The attendance 
increased very little, because of the constant cutting off of the lower or 
sub-collegiate classes, which had been fullest, and the substitution of 
higher, and therefore smaller classes. Of the 68 catalogued in 1843, 
only 25 were in collegiate classes; the number, therefore, had really 
trebled by 1851. ’
-P-A-G-E-317
  RICHMOND COLLEGE. 275 
Another notable change in the period under review was the discon- 
tinuance of theological instruction as a part of the course. This did 
not in any wise impair, it rather increased, the religious influence of the 
college, but it changed the main design, or as one might say, it shifted 
the centre of gravity. The seminary was designed especially for minis- 
terial students and admitted others on payment of fees; the college 
aimed ata liberal education for any and all vocations, and granted cer- 
tain privileges and exemptions to students preparing for the ministry. 
The seminary, moreover, was distinctively, in fact as in name, Baptist; 
the college, though unquestionably denominational, had from the first 
other denominations represented in its trustees and faculty, as well as 
in its students. 
THIRD DECADE. 
From 1851 to 1861 the college made large strides on the road to pros- 
perity. By the agencies hitherto employed—among which the work of 
Rev. L. W. Allen in 1847-49 deserves particular mention—means had 
been gathered for current expenses, alterations and repairs of buildings, 
and an interest-bearing fund of $16,680. At the annual meeting in 1851 
it was decided to raise $85,000 in bonds of $100 or over, payable in three 
annual instalments, the first to become due as soon as $60,000 had 
been secured., Rev. A. M. Poindexter was appointed agent, and all un- 
paid bonds and pledges hitherto given were turned over to him for ad- 
justment. His success was socomplete that on the 10th of June following 
he reported in bonds and cash $60,732.40; in unbonded subscriptions 
and pledges of less amount than $100, $3,696. This was counted as 
making the endowment $75,000, and the agent was requested to con- 
tinue his labors and raise $25,000 more for endowment and $50,000 for 
buildings.” At this he worked two years longer, and secured means to 
erect, in 1854, according to plans drawn by Thomas A. Tefft, architect, 
and at a cost of $25,500, the north wing of the present college building, 
devoted mainly to dormitories. The collection of bonds for endow- 
ment progressed fairly ; the funds invested in public securities was, in 
1854, $72,642 ; in 1859, $77,042. 
Increase of funds enabled the college to give its professors better 
salaries and to increase their number. In 1851 the chair of ancient 
languages was divided, Mr. Christian retaining the Greek, and George 
E. Dabney being chosen professor of Latin and French. This faculty— 
Messrs. Ryland, Christian, Dabney, Turner, and Puryear—remained 
without alteration for six years. The chair of Greek was filled 1857-59 
by Sidney H. Owens, then for one year by E. Adkins, and then by Will- 
iam P. Louthan and C. H. Toy. In place of Mr. Puryear, who resigned 
in 1858, William G. Strange was made professor of natural science; and 
in 1859 William S. Chase was made professor of modern languages. 
The academic department, revived in 1855, was conducted by Robert 
Hall, John C. Long, H. W. Reinhart, and A. B. Slocomb.  
-P-A-G-E-318
  276 HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA. 
The number of students fluctuated considerably. The fervid elo- 
quence of Poindexter stirred the people all over the State and the at- 
tendance ircreased rapidly, reaching its highest point (161) in 1855-56, 
coincident with the occupation of the new building and the re-opening 
of an academic department. From this it declined again till 1859-60 
and 1860-61, in both of which sessions the number was 114. 
Upon the establishment of a chair of modern languages, in 1859, the 
whole subject of degrees and awards was reconsidered, and it was de- 
cided that a “certificate of proficiency be given to a student who has 
satisfactorily completed the studies of any department;” the degree of 
A. B. for “ proficiency in the departments of Latin, Greek, mathemat- 
ics, natural science, and moral science,” with the privilege of substi- 
tuting one modern language or Hebrew for the calculus; and the de- 
gree of A. M. for proficiency in the whole course except Hebrew. 
SUSPENSION AND LOSSES. 
Inter arma silent leges. Silent also were the voices of art and litera- 
ture. With the outbreak of war in 1861 the youth of the Jand flocked 
to the front, and the college record began to receive opposite many a 
promising name the sad entry ‘“‘ Died in Confederate service,” or “ Killed 
in battle.” The buildings were occupied as barracks and as a hospital 
by the Confederates, and again as barracks by the Federal troops in 
1865; the apparatus was broken up and the library was carted away 
by a United States surgeon “to save it from destruction” (he after- 
wards kindly returned the Patent Office Reports and such like vol- 
umes); the endowment, or rather so much of it as had been invested 
in bank stocks and city and railroad bonds, was sold in 1862 and con- 
vertéd into Confederate 8's. Thus the trustees found themselves in 
1865 with desolated grounds, defaced buildings, $20,500 of State stock, 
and seven town lots in the suburbs of Chicago. Everything else had 
been swept away. ‘They authorized Professors Ryland and Dabney to 
take charge of the premises for one year and open a private school. 
REORGANIZATION IN 1866. 
Anteus renewed his strength by falling back upon the bosom of his 
mother. The college was more fortunate in having both mother and 
sons to support and revive it in its time of prostration. The General 
Association, into which the Education Society had now been merged, 
met in Richmond June 7-11, 1866. In the body were fourteen grad- 
uates and about twenty-five other sons of the college. A few of 
these, with also two or three alumni resident in the city, held a consul- 
tation as to what could be done for alma mater, and appointed Messrs. 
John C. Long, George B. Taylor, and H. H. Harris to lay their views 
before the association. Mr. Long had already secured the appoint- 
ment of a committee (T. G. Jones, A. Broadus, W. E. Hatcher, J. O.
-P-A-G-E-319
  RICHMOND COLLEGE. 2717 
Turpin, and W. R. McDonald, all former students) to consider and re- 
port on the interests of the college. The general feeling, however, was 
despondent, almost despairing. 
On Monday morning, June 11, the education board presented a re- 
port, showing that they had during the year “ collected no funds, as- 
sisted no young men, transacted no business,” because of the suspen- 
sion of the college and the depressed condition of the country. On 
this Drs. Burrows and Poindexter made burning appeals for the imme- 
diate resumption of ministerial education. Then Mr. McDonald pre- 
sented the report of his committee, in two resolutions, recommending 
the immediate opening of the college, and on a scale worthy of its sup- 
porters. “The report was advocated by G. W. Samson, J. C. Long, 
G. B. Taylor, W. 8. Penick, J. Thomas, Jr., A. M. Poindexter, H. H. 
Harris, T. W. Syduor, J. E. Massey, M. L. James, C. C. Bitting, and J. 
B. Watkins.” It will not be invidious discrimination to refer more par- 
ticularly to three of the speakers. Mr. Long, in behalf of the alumni, 
with true filial devotion, made a pathetic plea for their dismantled 
college, pointed proudly to her past, and pictured with prophetic power 
a yet brighter future. He urged the propriety of using the remnant ot 
endowment, if necessary, to re-open the college with full equipment. 
Mr. Taylor began more cautiously, advocating careful preservation of 
the existing fund as the nucleus of another endowment, but, warming 
up as he spoke, nobly seconded the appeal for early and complete re- 
sumption. The climax was reached when James Thomas, Jr., from his 
place near the centre of the church, briefly told how, as one of the 
trustees, he had protested against the change of investment, and when 
it was made in spite of all protest, had given up in despair, but added 
that “ the enthusiasm of those young men” had touched him, and that 
he was ready to subscribe $5,000 for another endowment, and pending 
its collection to pay the salary of one professor. This thrilled the au- 
dience with hope and settled the question. Dr. Poindexter at once’ 
got permission to take other subscriptions, amounting in all to some 
$8,000. The association thereupon added a third resolution, tendering 
to the trustees the subscription just made, and requesting them to take 
steps to increase it to not less than -$100,000. The trustees held a 
meeting the very next day, appointed J. L. Burrows, James Thomas, 
Jr., and J.B. Jeter a committee on new organization, and elected A. 
M. Poindexter agent to raise the proposed endowment. 
In asubsequent meeting the trustees adopted a plan of organization, 
which provided for a president and four professors. Of those first 
chosen, July 5, 1866, two only accepted—H. H. Harris and B. Puryear. 
E. B. Smith and Edmund Harrison were elected August 4, and Dr. T. 
G. Jones was chosen president August 24. To meet the expenses of 
refitting the buildings and providing apparatus they authorized the 
sale of the Chicago lots, and so, on the 1st of October, the college was

reopened with an attendance, which, tating the session, ran up to 
ninety—sixty-five non-resident and twenty-five resident students. 
NEW FEATURES. 
The committee on organization sought the aid of Drs. John A. 
Broadus, William D. Thomas, and C. C. Bitting, all of whom then re- 
sided in Greenville, 8. C., and the plan drawn up by those gentlemen, 
with some modifications of detail, was approved by the trustees and 
by the faculty when elected. Some of its improvements on the former 
policy are worthy of special attention: 
1. It proposed a system of independent schools. This increases the 
responsibility, and therefore the efficiency, of the professor, and enables 
the student, under proper advice, to select the course of study best suited 
to his wants, his ability, and his previous progress. The certificate, 
under the seal of the college, formerly awarded for “proficiency in any 
department” is now given for certain subsidiary subjects, and a mas- 
tery of the leading subjects taught in a school secures a diploma of 
graduation in that school. This feature had been long in operation in 
the University of Virginia, and the college, as we have seen, had here- 
tofore approached: it, but now, for the first time, adopted it fully. 
2. The English language was put on its proper plane as of equal dig- 
nity. with Latin or Greek, French or German. As early as 1856 the 
Albemarle Female Institute had established a school of English, and a 
year later the State University inaugurated its school of history and 
literature, but Richmond College claims to have led all the colleges 
of the land (except possibly one, of which we are in doubt) in doing 
appropriate honor to our peerless mother tongue. Many others have 
already followed the example. 
3. In reference to discipline, the plan provided that itshould be main- 
tained, “not so much by minute regulations, as by cultivating among 
the students the sentiment of personal honor and responsibility.” This 
allows the utmost freedom of social intercourse between pupils and 
teachers. It works more or less satisfactorily according to the age and 
character of the students, but, on the whole, yields far better results 
than any other system of college government. 
4. Attendance upon religious exercises was made purely voluntary. 
This may diminish somewhat the apparent amount of external, formal 
religion, but greatly to the advantage of real vital piety. 
5. Circumstances, rather than any deliberate purpose, introduced the 
messing system, which has since become popular, and has been taken 
up by other institutions. Among the resident students who came in 
1866 were some inured to camp life, while through the country pro- 
visions were abundant and money scarce. Thus clubs were formed, to 
live mainly on supplies sent them from home, with small contributions 
for necessary purchases and for the cost of serving meals. Out of this 
the present system has been developed through successive changes dic- 
tated by experience.

ENDOWMENTS AND BUILDINGS. 
The agency of Dr. Poindexter secured, in two years bonds and 
subscriptions to the amount of $75,000. But to suit the condition of 
the country, just recovering from four years of war and still under mil- 
itary rule, the bonds were made payable in five annual instalments, 
and the donors were allowed to retain the principal so long as they paid 
the interest. A little more than one-third of the amount was paid in 
and added to the interest-bearing fund. The rest was swallowed in the 
whirlpool of general bankruptcy which soon followed, or merged into 
the memorial endowment mentioned below. To accommodate the in- 
creasing number of resident students, cottage A, with eight dormito- 
ries, was built in 1869, at acost of $2,500, and the year following cottage 
B was erected by the liberality of Judge D. B. De Land, of Fairport, 
N. Y., who had already contributed handsomely to the endowment 
fund. His beneficence was the beginning of a rich stream of Northern 
gifts. 
In 1872 the General Association of Virginia Baptists, on motion of 
C. H. Ryland, resolved to celebrate next year its semi-centennial, and, 
among other things, to raise ‘a fund towards the permanent endowment 
and buildings of Richmond College.” The sum first proposed was 
$100,000, which, in the enthusiasm of the moment, was increased to 
$300,000. Dr. J. L. Burrows, who was selected to take charge of this 
“memorial movement,” employed scores of volunteer agents, who 
traversed the State, and collected very nearly the amount named in 
cash, bonds, promises, and promiscuous donations of nominal value. 
Several thousands were collected in Northern cities, chiefly through 
_ Rey. Dr. George B. Taylor. Of the “memorial fund” about one-half” 
has been paid in; its collection was cut short by the panic of 1873; the 
rest is of doubtful value. In 1873 the central portion of the present 
main building, containing chapel, lecture-rooms, and society halls, was 
erected according to plans drawn by A. Y. Lee, architect. This, with 
the alterations of the north wing to conform to the new style of archi- 
tecture, cost about $50,000. In 1877 the trustees expended $24,000 for 
an addition to the grounds, giving a good front eastward. This makes 
the campus a rectangle, 686 feet from Broad to Franklin, and 800 feet 
from Ryland to Lombardy Streets. , 
Upon the death of Dr. J. B. Jeter (February 18, 1880), a life-long 
friend of the college and the president of its trustees, a self-constituted 
committee undertook to erect to his memory a library hall. When the 
scheme seemed likely to fail James Thomas, Jr., again came to the rescue 
with a subscription of $5,000, on condition that the hall be so planned 
as to complete the unfinished college building. By the agency of Dr. 
A. E. Dickinson some $35,000 more was raised, mostly in the North, and 
the committee, in June, 1884, handed the trustees the keys of a nearly 
completed building. The erection of this, according to the plans of 
Capt. A. Lybrock, architect, and some further modifications of previous  
-P-A-G-E-322
  280 HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA. 
structures, have produced an edifice second in size and beauty to none 
in Virginia. The improvements to the old buildings, the introduc- 
tion of water and of a complete system of drainage, and the grading of 
the grounds entailed an expenditure of $15,000, to which nearly as 
much more must be added before all will be complete. The main floor 
of the new wing—a splendid room 103 by 43 feet clear and 22 feet pitch— 
is fitted up with tasteful walnut cases for the Jeter Library Hall. The 
upper floor of the same size and pitch will be similarly fitted up as the 
Thomas Museum, in memory of our most liberal benefactor, who died 
October 8, 1882. Besides the two instances already mentioned, when 
he came to the rescue in times of crisis, he was constantly giving to the 
college. His last gift, made in 1881, was an endowment of $25,000 for 
one of the chairs; the school of philosophy was subsequently designated. 
BEQUESTS. 
The college in its earlier years received some small legacies, but they 
were not kept separate from other funds, and can not now be satisfac- 
torily traced. Samuel Tunstall, a merchant of King and Queen County, 
Va., who died in 1876, devised property amounting to $8,200, now 
invested and held as the “Tunstall foundation.” James Phillips, of 
Richmond City, died in 1878, leaving to the college $5,000, which has 
been invested, and a residuary legacy, which is expected to yield several 
thousand more on the final settlement of his estate. Several other 
bequests of considerable value are known to have been made and will 
in due time be realized. The trustees look to this as one important 
source of supply for the ever-increasing needs of a growing institution. 
THE TRUSTEES. 
Want of space prevents us from giving a full list of all who have 
been trustees with the dates of their appointment, and death or resigna- 
tion. ‘They meet twice a year, in December and in June, and frequently 
at other times. The committees on finance, on grounds and buildings, 
and on library and museum, as well as not a few others of the body, give 
to the affairs of the college much valuable time and earnest thought. 
All act without fee or reward, even paying their own expenses in attend- 
ing meetings of the board. 
Their secretary and treasurer, Rev. C. H. Ryland, D. D., was elected 
in December, 1873, to attend to the “collection, preservation, and in- 
crease of the funds of the college.” He is also librarian and superin- 
tendent of grounds and buildings. 
CHANGES IN THE FACULTY. 
In 1869 the trustees abolished the office of president, and devolved 
its executive duties upon a chairman, to be nominated annually by the 
faculty. At the same time Dr. Jones resigned his connection with the 
college, since which Professor Puryear has been annually elected chair-
-P-A-G-E-323
  
RICHMOND COLLEGE. » 281 
man of the faculty. J. L. M. Curry, LL.D., was elected in 1868 pro- 
fessor of English, and filled the chair till 1881, when he became general 
agent.of the Peabody Fund. During most of the time he taught also 
the school of philosopby. odes Massie, now of the University of Ten- 
nessee, was elected professor of modern languages in 1873, and resigned 
in 1882. Prof. W. W. Valentine, in Mr. Massie’s absence, had filled the 
ehair for the session of 1880-81. Since 1882 its duties have been di- 
vided between Professors Smith and Harris. In 1873 the school of 
natural science was divided, Professor Puryear retaining chemistry 
and geology, and Charles H. Winston being chosen professor of phys- 
ics. in 1877-78 George 8S. Thomas filled the chair of Greek during the 
absence of the professor. Drs. William D. Thomas and A. B. Brown 
were elected to the chairs of philosophy and of English in 1881. 
A preparatory department was established in 1867, and was taught 
for one year by Messrs. L. T. Gwathmey and E. C. Cabell, undergradu- 
ates, then by H. A. Strode, E. K. Murray, William T. Thom, and L. T. 
Gwathmey, ranking as assistant professors. It was discontinued upon 
the increase of the faculty in 1873, and the work of some preparatory 
classes was assumed by the several professors. 
A commercial department was begun in 1867, under the charge of the 
professor of mathematics, and from 1868 was conducted for five years 
by Prof. G. Morris Nicol. 
A class in physiology and hygiene was formed in 1871 by Dr. Z. B. 
Herndon, and was continued for four years. 
A law school was established in 1870, and was conducted for two 
years by Profs. J. D. Halyburton and William Greene; for two years 
more by Profs. William A. Maury and James Neeson; and from 
1877-82 by Prof. Samuel D. Davies. 
ATTENDANCE OF STUDENTS. 
The total number enrolled in 1866-67, as we have seen, was ninety. 
Comparatively few of them were really prepared to enter college, be- 
cause the high schools and academies which once dotted the State, had 
been nearly all closed for five years. A preparatory department was 
for a while absolutely necessary. The situation of the college marked 
it also as a suitable place for a commercial course and for a law school. 
The addition of these adjuncts to the regular course and the revival of , 
agricultural prosperity brought a rapid increase in numbers, followed 
by subsequent reductions in consequence of circumstances which af- 
fected all similar institutions. Latterly there has been a steady ad- 
vance to the present number, 164, which is the largest attendance of 
collegiate students in our whole history. 
For years the college has had a larger Virginia patronage than any . 
other institution could boast, if we exclude professional schools. In 
the catalogue of this year are found students from New York, Penn- 
sylvania, New Jersey, Louisiana, and Florida (1 each), 2 each from
-P-A-G-E-324
  282 HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA. 
Maryland, West Virginia, and Mississippi, 3 from Georgia, 4 from 
Tennessee, 4 from North Carolina, 7 from South Carolina, and 135 from 
Virginia, 43 of these being from Richmond City. 
In age the students range from fifteen to thirty-five, the average be- 
ing about twenty. Those who will take a degree must attend from two 
to six sessions, according to preparation and ability ; seldom less than 
three, rarely over five. 
LIBRARY. 
The library, which had been gradually accumulating up to 1860, was 
robbed, as we have seen, in 1865 of all its valuable volumes. The ac- 
cumulation of another, while the college was struggling for existence, 
has been slow. Every year, however, has seen some additions by pur- 
chase or by gift. Edward Jorworth Owen, LL.D., a native of Wales, 
resident in Saint Louis, in 1867 (two or three years before his death), 
presented his very valuable library of 2,597 volumes. Charles K. Fran- 
cis, of New York, gave, in 1874-75, 162 “rare and valuable books.” Mrs. 
L. H. L. Herndon, of Washington, D. C., gave in 1875-76 “nearly 200 
volumes.” <A. P. Repiton, D. D. (one of the first graduates of the semi- 
nary) bequeathed in 1876 “over 100 volumes.” Dr. J. B. Jeter, in 1881, 
left to the college over 500 volumes and his manuscripts. During the 
same year Mrs. Frazer, of Orange County, Va., sent about 100 volumes 
from the library of her late husband, Rev. Herndon Frazer. Hon. Isaac 
Davis, LL.D., of Worcester, Mass., gave, in 1882, $1,000, to be used in 
the purchase of historical works. The names of Drs. C. C. Bitting, of 
Philadelphia, and Edward Bright, of New York, appear in several suc- 
cessive years as donors of valuable books. Many others, too numerous 
to mention in detail, have lent their assistance. Upon the completion 
of the new hall, in 1884, the two literary societies turned over to the 
college their libraries, amounting to nearly 2,000 volumes. 
Among the books thus gotten together, there were, of course, many 
duplicates, and some of little value. The librarian, with the assistance 
of Messrs. E. B. Pellard, W. A. Harris, and A. Bagby, spent a vaca- 
tion in arranging and cataloguing them. There appeared as worthy of 
a place in the list over 9,000 volumes. The system of library manage- 
ment, adopted after consultation with many experts, is believed to be 
the simplest and best. ; 
In prosecuting his agency for the Jeter memorial, Dr. A. E. Dickinson 
undertook to raise also a library fund of $50,000—one-half to be ex- 
pended at once, the other to be invested, and the interest used from year 
to year. He has not yet collected the full amount, but has enough 
secured to warrant the committee in making large purchases, and to 
insure valuable additions every year. 
In connection with the library, two reading-rooms have been opened— 
one in a public hallway, supplied with daily newspapers; another, 
more quiet, for the monthlies and quarterlies, as well as for examining 
books of reference.   
 
-P-A-G-E-325

MUSEUM. 
In 1874 the two literary societies, working independently, began the 
collection of museums. Within a year they had the nucleus of a good 
collection, and while continuing to work for its increase, handed it over 
to the care of the faculty. No satisfactory catalogue has yet been com- 
pleted, and until it is made, proper credit to donors can not be given. 
The number of contributors up to 1877 was about seventy-five, among 
them Rev. Dr. Bitting, Hon. B. O. Duncan, United States consul at 
Naples; Rev. Dr. Taylor, of Rome, and Dr. J. L. M. Curry, are mentioned. 
The last named has been unremitting in his interest, and has added 
much more than any other one person to the value of the collection. 
Among many contributors, since 1877, may be mentioned Lieut. J. C. 
Gresham, United States Army (Indian curiosities), Mrs. T. P. Crawford, 
and Mrs. S. J. Holmes, of Tung Chow, China; Rev. W. J. David, of 
Lagos, Africa; Rev. R. H. Graves, D. D., of Canton (a large historical 
collection of Chinese coins and other articles); Col. William Townes, of 
Mecklenburg, Virginia (valuable collection of coins), and Rev. W. C. 
Bitting (numerous specimens from the Luray Cavern). In the fall of 
1876 the trustees made a small appropriation, and sent Prof. C.H. Win- 
ston to Philadelphia, where he obtained, partly by gift and partly by 
purchase, many articles which had been exhibited in the Centennial 
‘Exposition. As soon as everything is mounted in the new hall, a com- 
plete catalogue, with full acknowledgments, will be prepared. 
LITERARY SOCIETIES. 
Very important adjuncts of the college are the two societies which 
meet weekly for debate and other literary exercises. The Mu Sigma 
Rho dates from 1846, its name and motto having been suggested by Dr. 
G. F. Holmes, then professor of ancient languages. The Philologian 
was organized in 1855. Each stimulates the other by a generous rivalry, 
and both work together, as in starting the museum, for the common good 
MEDALS. 
The Woods medal for excellence in declamation, awarded by a select 
committee after public contest, was founded in 1868 by a gift of $100, 
yielding $6 a year, from Hiram Woods, Esq., of Baltimore, Md. It is 
made in the shape of a crescent inscribed with the names of Chatham 
and Henry. 
The Frances Gwin medal, awarded by the professor of philosophy to 
his best graduate, was established in 1872 by Rev. D. W. Gwin, D. D., 
then of Atlanta, Ga., in honor of his mother. On it is engraved the~ 
figure of a student kneeling, with the motto, credo ut intelligam. 
The Steel medal, for excellence in reading, awarded by the faculty 
after competitive trial, was founded in 1875 by Dr. George B. Steel, of 
Richmond, who gave $200 so invested as to yield $10 a year.

The Tanner medal, awarded by the professor of Greek to his best 
graduate, was established in 1883 by the gift of. $250, so invested as 
to yield $15 a year, from Col. William E. Tanner, of Richmond, in 
memory of his parents, John F. and Harriet L. Tanner. It is in the 
shape of a Grecian helmet inscribed with the figure of Athena present- 
ing a crown and the legend, odd, dvev zdvov. 
SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The First Baptist Church, of Richmond, Va., gave in 1876, $1,055 to 
found a scholarship. It pays the tuition of one student nominated by 
the church. About the same time other sums amounting to $1,645 
were contributed to found scholarships for the benefit of sons of Vir- 
ginia Baptist ministers. Still another, to be named in memory of Dr. 
A. M. Poindexter, has been undertaken by the Dan River Association, 
in which he long lived and labored. On it $300 have been paid. 
In 1883 Hon. George A. Woolverton, of Albany, N. Y., proposed. the 
_ raising of a scholarship fund of $10,000. He has paid $1,000 for his 
part and the rest has been subscribed and partly paid. As soon as it 
is completed due publication will be made of the names of other donors 
and of the conditions on which the benefits may be obtained. Hon. J. ~ 
B. Hoyt, of Stamford, Conn., has recently paid over for a kindred pur- 7 
pose the sum of $5,000. j 
' ALUMNI. 
The plan of the college in requiring thorough mastery and rigid ex- 
aminations in every school, and in allowing selection of studies with 
reference to the student’s needs rather than to his graduation, limits 
the honor of its degrees to comparatively few persons. Many others = 
are quite as much benefited by the instruction received and reflect 
quite as much honor on the institution. The list of over 2,000 students 
who have not taken a degree includes three college presidents, half 
a dozen professors, as many judges, six or eight editors, and scores 
of lawyers, doctors, teachers, preachers, and other influential men. 
SOME GENERAL REMARKS. 
The foregoing sketch shows that Richmond College is emphatically a 
growing institution. Its plan allows indefinite expansion and admits 
contraction without jar whenever required by stress of circumstances. 
It is therefore able, while holding firmly to whatever is good in the 
ideas and systems of the past, to adapt itself readily to the demands of 
the future. Firmly rooted in the affections of a great Christian denomi- 
nation, and commanding the respect, the confidence, and, to no incon- 
siderable extent, the patronage of all denominations, including Israelites, 
it has grown by the combined labors and liberality of many. 
Its eight schools, equipped with all needful maps, charts, and appa- 
ratus and manned by seven professors, its buildings sufficient for the
-P-A-G-E-327

accommodation of two hundred and fifty students, its library and 
museum, its aids and incentives, its general and special endowments, 
and its alumni, scattered from New York to California, and from the 
lakes to Texas, are no mean result from these years of toil. Butit has 
not attained its goal, has not reached its purposed stature, it is but en- 
tering as if upon young manhood with bright visions of many victories 
yet to be won, great advances still to be made. All its traditions and 
all its hopes require that it shall offer the best facilities for getting a 
sound, liberal education at the lowest possible cost. The trustees have 
always carefully avoided debt, and cared more for solid worth than for 
mere show; the faculty have constantly insisted on honest industry, 
rigid examinations, and a high standard of graduation; the students 
have generously responded to the genius of the place, have aimed at 
real learning, and worked faithfully forits attainment; most of all, and 
best of all, the blessings of God have rested richly upon this outgrowth 
of the prayers and the self-sacrifices of His faithful servants. 
The following additional information has been received from the chair- 
man of the faculty of Richmond College: “Of the present faculty, 
Professors Thomas and Harris were students at Richmond College, ob- 
taining their B. A. in 1851 and 1856, respectively. Professors Thomas, 
Smith, Winston, and Harris (in the order named), obtained the master’s 
degree at the University of Virginia. Puryear and Harrison were stu- 
dents there but did not complete a degree-course. Pollard was edu- 
cated at Columbian College, District of Columbia, and Hasseleff in Eu- 
rope. Since the sketch was written we have considerably increased our 
endowment. It is about as follows :

  CHAPTER XXL 
VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE! 
The Virginia Military Institute was established and is supported by 
the State of Virginia. It was organized in 1839 as a State military 
and scientific school, upon the basis of the United States Military 
Academy at West Point, and has been in successful operation for forty- 
seven years. The cadets admitted consist of two classes, State and 
pay cadets. The Institute supplies to the State cadet his board and 
tuition; and, in consideration thereof, he is required to teach two years 
after graduation. The pay cadetis at his own expense, which averages 
$360 per academic year, for every charge, including clothing. The State 
cadets are selected from those who are unable to pay their own expenses. 
The State makes an annual appropriation for the support of the Vir- 
ginia Military Institute of $30,000. This sum supplies tuition and board 
to the State cadets without charge, and supports—by the aid of the 
  
1 Reprinted from “The South” June, 1887, A brief but excellent sketch of the Vir- 
ginia Military Institute may be found in the report of the superintendent of public 
instruction (Dr. W. H. Ruffner) of Virginia for 1872. A good sketch may also be 
found in the official register of the institute for 1886-87. The revised regulations for 
the Virginia Military Institute describe in minute detail its martial discipline and 
interior administration. The introductory address to the corps of cadets on the re- 
sumption of the academic exercises September 10, 1866, on ‘‘The Inner Life of the 
Virginia Military Institute Cadet,” by General Francis H. Smith, LL. D., superintend- 
ent of the institute, gives a striking picture of cadet life in ante-bellum days. The 
following interesting letter is printed in the official register for 1806-87: 
“Hpgrs. First BRIGADE, SECOND Corps, ARMY OF THE PoToMAc,

“ GENTLEMEN : Your circular of the 9th instant has been received, and I beg leave 
to say, in reply, that I only took the field from a sense of duty; and that the obliga- 
tion that brought me into service still retains me in it, and will probably continue to 
do so as long as the War shall last. At the close of hostilities I desire to assume the 
duties of my chair, and accordingly respectfully request that, if consistent with the 
interest of the Institute, the action of the board of visitors may be such as to admit 
of my return upon the restoration of peace.

tuition fees, and the income from vested funds—the faculty. In 1860 
a donation of $20,000 was made by General Philip St. George Cocke, for 
the endowment of the chair of agriculture, and in the same year a dona- 
tion was made of $11,000 by Dr. William Newton Mercer, of Louisiana, 
to endow the chair of animal and vegetable physiology, applied to agri- 
culture. A donation was made at the same time by Mrs. E. L. Claytor, 
of Virginia, of $5,000, to erect a hall of natural history. 
The Virginia Miltary Institute had just placed itself before the pub- 
lic as a general school of applied science, for the development of the 
agricultural, mineral, commercial, manufacturing, and internal improve- 
ment interests of the State and country, when the army of General Hun- 
ter destroyed its stately buildings and consigned to the flames its library 
of 10,000 volumes, the philosophical apparatus used for ten years by 
“Stonewall” Jackson, and all its chemicals. The cadets were then 
transferred to Richmond and the institution was continued in vigorous 
operation until the evacuation of Richmond on the 3d of April, 1865. 
On the 21st of September, 1864, the board of visitors met in Richmond 
to reorganize the institution. The War had made sad traces on the 
school, besides the destruction of its building, library, and apparatus. 
Three of its professors, Lieut. Gen. ‘‘ Stonewall” Jackson, Maj. Gen. R. 
E. Rodes, and Col. 8. Crutchfield, two of its assistant professors, Capt. 
W.H. Morgan, and Lieut. L. Crittenden, and 200 of its alumni had 
been slain in battle, and 350 others maimed. Considering, however, the 
great demand flowing from the general suspension of education in the 
South, and the special field of usefulness distinctly marked out for this 
school of applied science, the board of visitors proceeded with energy 
and resolution in their work, and having elected Gen. G. W. Custis Lee 
and Col. Wm. B. Blair, distinguished graduates of the U. 8. Military 
Academy, to fill two of the chairs made vacant by the death of Gene- 
ral Jackson and General Rodes, and at subsequent meetings appointed 
Commodore M. F. Maury, LL. D., late of the Observatory, professor of 
physics and superintendentof the physical survey of Virginia, and Capt. 
John M. Brooke, late of the Navy, to the new chair of practical astron- 
omy, geodesy, physical geography, and meteorology, the Virginia Mili- 
tary Institute resumed its accustomed work amid its ruins at Lexing- 
ton on the 17th of October, 1865, with some 50 cadets, organized in four 
classes, and prosecuted its work with earnestness and effect, and on the 
Fourth of July following, 10 cadets, constituting the first’ class, who 
had borne the hardships and perils of the institution during the whole 
of the War, were graduated, having completed a course of scientific and 
general study which will commend them to the confidence of the scien- 
tific scholar. 
The Legislature of Virginia promptly responded to these evidences of 
vitality on the part of the school by providing for the payment of its 
annuity and the interest on its vested funds. This provision enabled 
the board of visitors to appoint the State cadets required by law to be

admitted, and arrangements were at the same time in progress to re- 
store the buildings; and on the 1st of July, 1870, they had the pleasure — 
to report to the Governor the complete execution of this work, including 
a full equipment of the laboratories, engineering, and drawing depart- 
ments of the institution. The Virginia Military Institute now numbers 
1,334 graduates, 430 of whom were State cadets. There have been al- 
together 4,975 matriculates, and of these 813 were State cadets. 
By the Act approved March 15, 1884, relief was given to the Virginia 
Military Institute, by providing substantially for the payment of the 
floating debt and the gradual retirement of the whole of its bonded 
debt; these debts resulting from the work of restoring the ruin of war. 
SYSTEM OF INSTRUCTION AND GOVERNMENT. 
The system of instruction and government in the Virginia Military 
Institute is distinctive. and is founded upon that of the United States 
Military Academy at West Point. As soon as a young man enters this 
institution it assumes over him an entire control, and not only directs his 
moral and intellectual education, but provides everything required for 
his personal wants or comfort. A cadet may, if his parents desire it, 
remain in the charge of the institution for the entire term of four years, 
as the system of government keeps it always in operation. The months 
of July and Augustin each year are devoted exclusively to military ex- 
ercises. Furloughs are granted to those who may desire it, in turn, dur- 
ing this period. The cadets are lodged and boarded in the institution, 
their clothing, books, and other supplies being provided by the quar- 
termaster of the Institute at cost. The sick are under the special care 
of the surgeon, with hospital and other facilities for nursing. 
The energy, system, subordination, and self-reliance which the mili- 
tary government of the Institute cultivates give a practical character 
to the education which it supplies. The high reputation which its 
alumni have established for the school is the evidence of its value. At- 
tendance at church and Bible instruction are prescribed for each Sab- 
bath. The government of the Virginia Military Institute, although 
military in its organization, is carefully arranged for the protection and 
_ development of the moral character of the cadets. Attendance on the 
public services of the sanctuary and regular Bible instruction on the 
Sabbath are positively enjoined by the regulations. 
Appended to the report of the examining board, July, 1875, is the 
following remark: ‘In conclusion, your committee can not too highly 
commend what has seemed to them the marked and distinguishing fea- 
. tures of this institution, the happy combination of the military system 
of instruction with the department of science and of literary culture, 
and the more ennobling culture of the heart and soul. Nowhere else 
have we seen this combination so complete and perfect. We can not 
speak of it too highly. Itis such a system as fits a pupil for life and 
for death. Under its guidance he is sure to tread always the path of 
duty, virtue, and honor.”

MEDALS AND SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The Hon. A. J. B. Beresford Hope, M. P. for the University of Cam- 
bridge, England, acting as representative of the association which pre- 
sented to Virginia the statue of *¢ Stonewall” Jackson, by Foley, trans- 
mitted, in 1876, the sum of £243 16s. 1d., being a surplus of the statue 
fund, to be invested as the foundation of a further memorial of the great 
Confederate soldier. By authority of the honored donors, and in ex- 
ecution of their wishes, this fund was dedicated to be invested and 
perpetuated as an inalienable and inviolable capital, the annual income 
from which shall be expended in procuring two prizes of gold, to be 
engraved and designated as “The First Jackson-Hope Medal,” and 
‘The Second Jackson-Hope Medal,” respectively, and to be bestowed 
annually, as rewards of merit, upon the two most distinguished grad- 
uates of the Virginia Military Institute in the order of their distine- 
tion. . 
It was deemed most becoming that this fund should be dedicated to 
the institution of learning which Jackson, as instructor and disciplin- 
arian, so long and conspicuously adorned, his official connection with 
which was severed only by his illustrious death ; and it is equally ap- 
. propriate that its designation shall forever associate the munificence 
of his English admirers with his imperishable name, 
As long as the Virginia Military Institute stands it will prize, as one 
of its prerogative distinctions, the peculiar relation which it bears to 
the history of General T. J. Jackson. Here for a long time he labored 
as a professor. From her parade ground, in command of the corps of 
cadets, he made his first march in his career of glory, and when his 
career was closed by a soldier’s death, to the corps of cadets was as- 
signed the solemn charge of conducting his remains to the resting place 
selected by himself with his dying breath. 
By the generosity of those English gentlemen, whose munificence 
presented to the Commonwealth of Virginia a majestic statue of her 
illustrious son, this distinction for the Institute has been signalized and 
rendered conspicuous and perpetual. The two costly medals provided 
for in the benefaction, to be bestowed hereafter, annually, upon the 
first and second distinguished graduates of the Institute, will connect 
their names with that of Jackson, and will be cherished heirlooms for 
their descendants. 
Two scholarships have been established by the board of visitors on 
the endowment of General Philip St. George Cocke, for some time pres- 
ident of the board of visitors, and two on the endowment of Messrs. 
J. K. Gilliat & Co., of London, England. These scholarships entitle 
the holders to free board, tuition, and room-rent, and are valued each 
at the sum of $275.

  CHAPTER XXII. 
WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY. 
By PROFESSORS WHITE AND HARRIS. 
The history of Washington and Lee University is connected with the 
early settlement of the beautiful “‘ Valley of Virginia.” The lands ly- 
ing contiguous to the headwaters of the James and Shenandoah Rivers 
were occupied, about a century after the settlement at Jamestown, by 
an energetic, adventurous, and brave race of people, distinguished for 
their devotion to civiland religious liberty. These hardy “Scotch-Irish” 
1 Among these Scotch-Irish settlers of the Valley of Virginia was Robert Alexander, 
a master of arts of Trinity, who settled in Augusta County, 1743. In the Historical 
Sketch of the Catalogue of the Officers and Alumni of Washington and Lee University 
(1749-1888), it is said that the germ of this institution was ‘‘a mathematical and 
classical school, called the Augusta Academy, established in 1749 by Robert Alexan- 
der, and first located two miles south-west of the site of Greenville, in Augusta, and 
near the interlacingssof the headsprings of the Shenandoah on the eastward and of 
the James River on the westward. It was the first classical school in the Valley of 
Virginia, and was continued by an uninterrupted succession of principals and assist- 
ant instructors, on successive sites, increasing in usefulness and influence, until it 
gradually developed into Washington College [now Washington and Lee Univer- 
sity].” Robert Alexander is said to have been the predecessor of Dr. Brown and Mr. 
Graham, as principal of Augusta Academy. The early history of Augusta Academy 
is very obscure, and the editor of this report has been much perplexed by the varying 
accounts of recognized authorities, some of which he has endeavored to disentangle 
in the next chapter, on the ‘‘ Bibliography of Washington and Lee University.” 
The following account of Scotch-Irish educational beginnings in Virginia and at 
the South has been taken, at the suggestion of the Commissioner of Education, from 
The Early History of the Scotch and Irish Churches, and their Relations to the Pres- 
byterian Church of Ameriéa, by Rev. J. G. Craighead, D. D.: 
“The Presbyterian colonists of Virginia also made as ample provision for the edu- 
cation of their youth as their circumstances permitted. In most of their congregations 
pastors established classical and scientific schools. West of the Blue Ridge such 
a school was carried on at New Providence [in Augusta County] by the Rev. John 
Brown; while east of the Ridge [in Louisa County] a similar institution was con- 
ducted by the Rev. John Todd. * * * 
“The first of these, after removals to Mount Pleasant, where it was known as 
Augusta Academy, and then to Timber Ridge as Liberty Hall, finally became Wash- 
ington College. The widespread desire for literary institutions of a high order led 
the Presbytery of Hanover, as early as 1771, to take measures to establish an academy 
in Prince Edward County, which subsequently was chartered as Hampden-Sidney 
College. These institutions, so humble in their origin, awakened such a thirst for 
knowledge in the minds of large numbers of the youth of that State, that not a few

occupants of the Blue Mountains of Virginia were among the bravest 
of Revolutionary soldiers. In the darkest days of our struggle for in- 
dependence General Washington expressed his confidence in their patri- 
otism and courage; saying that, if all other resources should fail, he 
might retire with a single standard to Augusta, and rally a band of pat- 
riots who would meet the enemy on the line of the Blue Ridge, and there 
establish the boundary of a free empire in the West. Augusta em- 
braced the fine country, in the heart of the valley, now bearing that 
name, and the neighboring counties of Rockbridge and Botetourt, lying 
southwest and immediately on the headwaters of the James. Two com- 
panies of soldiers from Augusta were with General Washington at Brad- 
dock’s defeat and at the battle of the Great Meadows. 
‘These valley people, distinguished as they were for patriotism, were 
not less devoted to the cause of religion and education, and had hardly 
established places of abode when they erected the temple of worship 
and the school-house, the men quarrying the stone and hewing the tim- 
ber while their wives and daughters carried the sand, packed in sacks 
on horses, sometimes to the distance of six or eight miles. ; 
William and Mary was the only college in Virginia at this early period, 
and as it was located in the lower portion of the State, the Scotch-Irish 
settlers of the valley determined to establish a high school in their sec- 
tion.   
of them afterward became eminent for their literary attainments, and were distin- 
guished in the pulpit and at the bar. 
“Classical schools of great excellence were organized by Dr. David Caldwell at 
Buffalo, and afterward at Guilford, N. C., in whic many of the most eminent men 
of the South—lawyers, statesmen, and clergymen—were educated; by Dr. Samuel E. 
McCorkle, a thorough scholar and earnest student, whose school at Thyatira, N. C., 
bore the significant name of Zion Parnassus, and in which there was a department 
for the education of school teachers, and provision was made to have poor and pious 
young men taught free of expense, of whom 45 entered the pulpit; by the Rev. Will- 
iam Bingham, at Wilmingion, and subsequently at Chatham and Orange; by Dr. 
Joseph Alexander, at Sugar Creek; by Dr. Alexander McWhorter, principal of 
‘Queen’s Museum,’ in whose hall the debates preceding the Mecklenburg Declara- 
tion were held, and which the Legislature of North Carolina afterward chartered 
under the name of Liberty Hall Academy. Other classical and scientific schools were 
taught by Rev. Dr. Robinson, at Poplar Tent; by Dr. Wilson, at Rocky River; by Dr. 
Hall, at Bethany; by the Rey. Henry Patillo, at Orange and Granville; and by Dr. 
Waddell, at Wilmington, under whose instruction some of the ablest civilians of the 
State were educated. 
‘A large number of Presbyterian families moved at an early day from Virginia and 
the Carolinas into Tennessee, who carried with them their love of education. The 
Rev. Samuel Doak, a graduate of Princeton College, opened a classical school in Wash- 
ington County [Tenn.], which was afterwards incorporated under the name of Martin 
Academy, and finally became known as Washington College. This was the first lit- 
erary institution established in the Mississippi Valley. The books that formed the 
nucleus of the college library were transported from Philadelphia over the mountains 
in sacks on pack-horses. After acting as president of the college for several years, 
Mr. Doak resigned and remoyed to Bethel, where he founded Tusculum Academy, and 
continued to be the active advocate and patron of learning, as he had ever been the 
decided friend of civil and religious liberty.”

One of the earliest, if not the very earliest school established, was 
known first as Augusta Academy,! then as Mount Pleasant, and during 
the Revolutionary War as Liberty Hall. This school, after occupying 
other neighboring localities, was finally established in the vicinity of 
Lexington, Va., May, 1776, under the name of Liberty Hall Academy 
with William Graham, its virtual founder, as its rector. Mr. Graham was 
the son of a Pennsylvania farmer, who lived in Paxton Township, near 
the site of the city of Harrisburg, and was educated at Princeton, where 
he was a class-mate of General Henry Lee, familiarly known as ‘“Light- 
Horse Harry,” the confidential friend of Washington, and ancestor of 
Gen. Robert E. Lee, the late president of Washington and Lee University. 
There was thus, in some sort, an association between General Washing- 
ton and the founder of Liberty Hall Academy. Liberal subscriptions, 
considering their scanty means, were made for the maintenance of their 
school by these good and true men, who gave sums ranging from 1 to 
10 pounds sterling, and Mr. Graham made a northern tour as far as 
Boston, collecting 776 pounds and 18 shillings. 
Among the pupils of Liberty Hall were Priestly, the distinguished 
teacher of Tennessee, and Alexander, of Princeton, whose descendants 
to the third generation are so widely known for their worth, talents, 
and learning. 
Liberty Hall was seriously embarrassed in its operations, and almost 
disbanded during the struggle for independence then convulsing the 
country. When the General Assembly was driven from the low coun- 
try towards the mountains by the British dragoons under Tarleton, the 
rector of the academy, with his boys and such of his neighbors as he 
could rally, marched to Rockfish Gap to dispute the passage of the Blue 
Ridge. What with the interruptions incident to the War, and the em- 
barrassed condition of its finances in consequence of a depreciated cur- 
rency, the academy was very much crippled, its entire property at this 
time being estimated at £2,000. 
1“The Presbytery of Hanover, about the year 1773, determined to establish ‘Augusta 
Academy,’ and it was at first proposed to locate the institution at Staunton. At a 
meeting of Presbytery in April, 1775, persons were appointed to solicit subscriptions 
in behalf of the academy, among whom were William McPheeters and John Trimble 
at North Mountain; Thomas Stuart and Walter Davis at Tinkling Spring; Samp- 
son Mathews at Staunton, and George Mathews, George Moffett, and James Allen in 
Augusta Congregation. In May, 1776, the Presbytery determined to locate the school 
on Timber Ridge ‘as there was no one in Staunton to take the management and it 
was uncertain whether there ever would be.’ At the same time the ie. William 
Graham was elected rector, and a young man named John Montgemery his assistant. 
Mr. Graham was born in Pennsylvania in 1746, and was educated at Princeton Col- 
lege. Mr. Montgomery was born in Augusta, and graduated at Princeton in 1775. 
He spent the last years of his life as pastor of Rocky Spring Church in Augusta. 
Trustees were also appointed: Rev. John Brown, Rey. James Waddell, Thomas and 
Andrew Lewis, William Preston, Sampson Mathews, Samuel McDowell, George Mof- 
fett, and others. In 1779 the school was removed to Lexington and called ‘Liberty 
Hall.’ An act of incorporation by the Legislature was obtained in 1782, and the in- 
stitution has now become ‘ Washington and Lee University.”” (Waddell’s Annals of 
Augusta County, Va., pp. 184, 185.)  
-P-A-G-E-342
  296 HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA. 
Liberty Hall Academy was chartered in 1782 by the Legislature of 
Virginia, and was the first literary institution incorporated by the State 
after the English colony became a Commonwealth. 
In January, 1796, the rector called a meeting of the trustees, ‘“ to take 
into consideration some information that he had received, that the Leg- 
islature of Virginia had resolved that there should bea seminary in the 
upper part of the State, and that the President of the United States 
was about to bestow his 100 shares in the James River Company to aid 
in endowing the same.” 
Early in 1784 the Virginia Legislature chartered the first company to 
improve the navigation of James River. Soon afterwards they passed 
an act instructing the State treasurer to subscribe 100 additional shares 
in the company, “ the said shares to be vested in George Washington, 
his heirs and assigns forever.” This was not designed as a trust fund, 
but was a gift, as they expressed it in the preamble to the act, “ out of 
the desire of the representatives of this Commonwealth to embrace every 
suitable occasion of testifying their sense of the unexampled merits of 
George Washington, Esquire, towards his country, and itis their wish in 
particular that these great works for its improvement, which, both as 
springing from the liberty which he has been so instrumental in estab- 
lishing, and as encouraged by his patronage, will be durable monu- 
ments of his glory, may be made monuments also of the gratitude of 
his country.” On receiving a copy of this act, Washington wrote to 
the Governor declining to accept the donation designed for his private 
emolument, expressing, however, his “ profound and grateful acknowl- 
edgments inspired by so signal a mark of their beneficent intentions 
towards himself.” His reason for declining the gift is expressed in the 
following letter: ‘ When I was called to the station with which I was 
honored, during the late conflict of our liberties, to the diffidence which 
I had so many reasons to feel in accepting it, I thought it my duty to 
join a firm resolution to shut my hand against every pecuniary recom- 
pense ; to this resolution I have invariably adhered ; from this resolu- 
tion (if I had the inclination) I do not feel at liberty to depart. But if 
it should please the General Assembly to permit me to turn the destina- 
tion of the fund, vested in me, from my private emolument to objects of a 
public nature, it will be my study, in selecting these, to prove the sin- 
cerity of my gratitude for the honor conferred on me, by preferring such 
as may appear most subservient to the enlightened and patriotic views 
ot the Legislature.” 
The General Assembly, at the ensuing meeting in October, 1785, in 
compliance with this request, repealed the former act, and in its stead 
enacted, “that the said shares with the tolls and profits thereafter ac- 
eruing from them, should stand appropriated to such objects of a pub- 
lic nature, in such manner and under such distributions as the said 
George Washington, Esquire, by deed during his life, or by his last will - 
and testament, should direct and appoint.”

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY. 297 
During ten years of unfinished work the James River stock was un- 
productive, and Washington determined to defer the appropriation of 
his interest until it should appear whether any profits would accrue. 
Washington referred the decision of the object to the Legislature, who 
referred it back to him, with the suggestion that he should bestow the 
gift upon some seminary of learning in the upper country, as the lower 
country was adequately provided with academies and colleges. On 
learning that General Washington was left to determine the object of 
his bounty, General Andrew Moore, of Rockbridge, and General Francis 
Preston, of Washington County, both at that time Representatives in 
Congress from western Virginia, called the attention of the illustrious 
patriot to Liberty Hall Academy, as an object worthy of his donation. 
In September, 1796, General Washington officially communicated to 
Governor Brooke his decision in favor of Liberty Hall Academy. In 
recognition of this generous gift the authorities at Liberty Hall ad- 
dressed the following letter to Washington: 
“Srr: It was not earlier than September, 1797, that we were officially 
informed of your liberal donation to Liberty Hall Academy. Permit 
us, as its immediate guardians, to perform the pleasing duty of ex- 
pressing those sentiments of gratitude which so generous an act natur- 
ally inspires. We have long been sensible of the disadvantages to 
which literary institutions are necessarily subjected, whilst dependent 
on precarious funds for their support. Reflecting particularly on the 
many difficulties through which this seminary has been conducted since 
the first moments of its existence, we can not but be greatly affected by 
an event which secures to it a permanent and independent establish- 
ment. Convinced as we are that public prosperity and security are inti- 
mately connected with the diffusion of knowledge, we look around with 
the highest satisfaction on its rapid advances in these United States, 
unfeignedly rejoicing that the citizen who has been long distinguished 
as the assertor of the liberties of his country, adds to this illustrious 
character the no less illustrious one of patron of the arts and literature. 
And we trust that no effort will be wanting on our part to encourage 
whatever branches of knowledge may be of general utility. That 
you may long enjoy, besides the uninterrupted blessings of health and 
repose, the superior happiness which none but those who deserve it 
can enjoy, and which arises from the reflection of having virtuously and 
eminently promoted the best interests of mankind, is the present prayer 
of the trustees of Washington Academy, late Liberty Hall. » 
| “ By order of the board, 
“SAMUEL Houston, 
“ Olerk.” 
General Washington wrote in reply as follows: 
“MouNT VERNON, June 17, 1798. 
“GENTLEMEN: Unaccountable as it may seem, it is nevertheless 
true, that the address with which you were pleased to honor me, dated 
the 12th of April, never came to my hands until the 14th instant.

“To promote literature in this rising empire, and to encourage the 
arts, have ever been amongst the warmest wishes of my heart. And 
if the donation which the generosity of the Legislature of the Common- 
wealth of Virginia has enabled me to bestow on Liberty Hall, now 
by your politeness called Washington Academy, is likely to prove a 
mean to accomplish these ends, it will contribute to the gratification of 
my desires. Sentiments like those which have flowed from your pen 
excite my gratitude, whilst I offer my best vows for the prosperity of 
the Academy, and for the honor and happiness of those under whose 
auspices it is conducted. 
“GEO. WASHINGTON.” 
The Washington donation at this day yields 6 per cent. interest on 
$50,000. 
The foregoing details are derived mainly from an unpublished manu- 
script of the late Rev. Henry Ruffner, D. D., who was for many years 
president of Washington College. 
The Association of the Cincinnati of Virginia was organized by the 
surviving officers of the Revolutionary War, with the view of perpetu- 
ating fraternal relations and to provide for the widows and orphans of 
their comrades in arms. When there had ceased to be any objects re- 
quiring relief from their treasury, the society resolved, influenced by 
the example of their illustrious chief, as they declared, to appropriate 
their funds to Washington Academy, and on 13th December, 1302, in 
the city of Richmond, adopted the following resolutions : 
“1st. That a committee be appointed of thirteen to make an appropri- 
ation of the funds of the society to such objects as may be agreed upon 
by the present meeting, subject, however, to confirmation by a majority 
of the whole number composing the society at the next general meeting, 
in person or by proxy, appointed in writing or by letter to the president, 
and of which due notice shall be given in the public papers and by let- 
ter from the president. 
“2d, That the object of the appropriation of the funds of the society 
be the seminary of learning in the county of Rockbridge, denominated 
Washington Academy (to which the shares of the James River Company, 
heretofore vested in our late illustrious leader and hero, General Wash- 
ington, have by him been appropriated), subject to such charges of a 
charitable nature as have been or may be adopted by this society.” 
The fund, so generously conveyed, now yields to the institution that 
received it the interest on about $23,000. 
John Robinson, of Rockbridge County, Va., a native of Lreland and 
a soldier under Washington, in imitation of the munificeuce of his com- 
mander, bequeathed to the school, now under a new charter styled 
Washington College, of which he was himself a trustee, his estate, 
which the authorities of the college made available as an endowment for 
about $40,000. 4

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY. 299 
Founded in the opening of our eventful struggle for independence, 
generously sustained by its origina} friends, and at a later period in its 
history munificently endowed by Washington and his compatriots, 
Washington College became and continued to be a valuable seminary of 
learning, sending out a large number of alumni, who conspicuously 
adorned the various learned professions, the halls of legislation, both 
State and national, and the walks of private life. 
Having on two occasions, in its earlier history, been the victim of fire, 
and having participated in and survived the struggle for American in- 
dependence, the College during the late unhappy War suffered very seri- 
ously in the damage done to its buildings, its library, and philosophical 
apparatus, and in the temporary failure of any income from its endow- 
ment fund. 
Notwithstanding this prostration of its material interests, the board 
of trustees metin the summer of 1865, and with a liberality highly com- 
mendable pledged their individual credit in negotiating a loan, by means 
of which they might repair the desolations and see again in operation 
the school that had been entrusted to their control. 
General Robert Edward Lee, who it was known had declined all pro- 
posals that seemed to involve a compromise of personal independence, 
was tendered the presidency of Washington College, in the belief that 
he might accept a position which would give him honorable employ- 
ment, the thing that he desired, and would at the same time be a chan- 
nel through which he might do something for the intellectual and moral 
training of the young men of the country. The position was accepted 
by General Lee under the influence of these considerations, and in doing 
so he gave a new impulse to the old college of Washington, attracting 
a large number of students, reassuring its friends and enlisting in its 
behalf many generous benefactors in all parts of the country. 
The course of instruction, academic and professional, was greatly 
enlarged under the energetic and wise administration of General Lee, 
who brought to the school, not only the weight of his elevated Christian 
character, which gave him unsurpassed influence over all who came 
within its sphere, but also a thorough and intelligent knowledge of what 
should be required in a leading institution of learning. 
Washington College, up to 1865, had the organization of most Ameri- 
ean colleges—a fixed curriculum of four years, terminating in the de- 
gree of bachelor of arts. In 1865-66 the course of instruction was 
broken up into separate schools. This change was made in view of the 
heterogeneous character of the students and their varying aims and 
grade of preparation. As the inconveniences of this organization be- 
came more apparent there has been a gradual reversion to a curriculum, 
with a pretty wide election, so that the present organization is substan- 
tially the same as that of Yale or Princeton. The University at present 
embraces three courses for the degree of bachelor of arts; fuller and 
more thorough courses for the degree of master of arts; special courses
-P-A-G-E-346

for doctor of philosophy, and schools of law and civil engineering. 
The present productive endowmentpf Washington and Lee University 
amounts to a little over $600,000, and its entire property is valued at 
about $800,000. 
The course which General Lee proposed to pursue in the disturbed 
condition of the country at that time is shown by the following senti- 
ments, expressed in his letter of August 24, 1865, addressed to the board 
of trustees, in which he indicated his acceptance of the presidency : 
“T think it the duty of every citizen, in the present condition of the 
country, to do all in his power to aid in the restoration of peace and 
harmony, and in no way to oppose the policy of the State or General 
Government directed to that object. It is particularly incumbent on 
those charged with the instruction of the young to set them an exam- 
ple of submission to authority.” 
The work of fully organizing the professional, classical, and scientific 
departments was completed under the assiduous supervision of Gen- 
eral Lee, and remains a monument to his faithful labor, and the effort 
to secure a more adequate endowment fund was progressing favorably, 
when, in October, 1870, Washington College was called to mourn the 
death of its honored president.) 
The board of trustees at once assembled, and elected General George 
Washington Custis Lee to fill the office of president, made vacant by 
the death of his father, the name of the institution being changed by 
an act of the Legislature from Washington College to Washington and 
Lee University. : 
He was inaugurated in February, 1871, and has filled the presidency 
of Washington and Lee University for the period of seventeen years, 
during which the institution has received many signal testimonials of 
public favor, has sustained its reputation as a thorough school of learn- 
ing, and now affords superior educational advantages to the young men 
of the country.   
1General Lee is buried in the chapel of Washington and Lee University, standing 
in the foreground of the general view of the institution. This chapel, without the 
apse-like addition, was the first building erected under the direction of General Lee 
after he assumed the presidency of the University. The accompanying view of the 
interior of the apsis shows the monumental chamber, in which is placed Valentine’s 
recumbent figure of General Lee. The lower story of the apsis contains the crypt or 
vault, in which the remains of General Lee repose. Adjoining the crypt and under- 
neath the chapel is the room used as an office by General Lee during his presidency, 
and kept now precisely as he left it. The foreground of the picture represents the 
_ platform of the University chapel. The portraits upon the wall are of certain dis- 
tinguished men: Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Chief-Justice Marshall, General 
Zachary Taylor; and certain benefactors of the institution: W. W. Corcoran, War- 
ren Newcomb, Thomas A. Scott, Dr. W. N. Mercer, and Vincent L. Bradford. The 
general effect is very striking, and illustrates the educational history of Virginia in a 
remarkable manner. Harvard University has its memorial hall, frequented daily by 
Cambridge students. Here is the shrine of Washington and Lee University, facing 
young Virginians as they meet for chapel service. These memorials are now historic, 
and they can be viewed with interest and profit by any historical student.

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY 
By THE EDITOR. 
Manuscript History of Washington College, by Henry Ruffner, D. D. 
This unpublished account of the early history of the college is by one of its for- 
mer presidents, the father of Dr. W. H. Ruffner, who was for a long time 
superintendent of public instruction in Virginia. The editor of this report 
finds the Ruffner manuscript quoted in Howe’s Historical Collections of Vir- 
ginia, p. 433, where the origin of the academy of Hampden-Sidney in 1774 
(chartered as a college in 1783) is explained as a Presbyterian foundation, 
“established in Prince Edward, at a point convenient for the Presbyterians 
of Virginia and North Carolina.” Howe quotes at some length from Dr. 
Henry Ruffner, not only upon the origin of Hampden-Sidney, but upon the 
origin of the other Presbyterian foundation in the State of Virginia, which 
Howe says was built upon Timber Ridge, near Fairfield, in Rockbridge 
County, 1776. (See Howe’s Historical Collections, pp. 419, 454, and 455.) 
Howe’s quotation from Dr. Ruffner is not very satisfactory, and students 
of Virginia educational history would be glad to see the original manu- 
script in published form. The historian’s son, Dr. W. H. Ruffner, informs 
the writer that the manuscript is in the keeping of the secretary and libra- 
rian of Washington and Lee University, Mr. Jacob Fuller. 
Foote’s Sketches of Virginia. First Series, Chapters XX, XXI, pp. 
438-489; and Second Series, Chapter VII, pp. 96-97. 
This work is far more satisfactory than Howe’s Collections upon the educational 
beginnings of Virginia. In fact, Foote is invaluable for students of Vir- 
ginia local history and ecclesiastical biography. Foote finds the germ of 
Washington College, or Liberty Hall Academy, in a private grammar school, 
kept by the Rey. John Brown,! and adopted, in 1774 by the Presbytery of   
1 Rey. John Brown was a graduate of Nassau Hall, in the class of 1749, and a licen- 
tiate of the New Castle Presbytery. 
He began his ministerial life in 1753, when he became the pastor of New Providence 
church, Augusta County, Virginia. He married Margaret Preston, the second daugh- 
ter of John Preston and Elizabeth Patton, who emigrated from Ireland in 1740, and 
settled near Staunton, Va. After serving his congregation faithfully for forty-four 
years, weighed down with the infirmities of age, he resigned his charge of New Provi- 
dence and followed his children to Kentucky, where he died, in the seventy-fifth year 
of his age, 1803. His wife preceded him to the grave, dying, in 1802, in the seventy- 
third year of her age. They are both buried at Frankfort, Ky. They reared seven 
children; First, Elizabeth, who married Rev. Thomas B. Craighead, of Tennessee ; 
second, Johu, who married Margarettia Mason, of New York; third, William, a phy- 
sician, who died early, in South Carolina; fourth, Mary, who married Dr. Alexander 
Humphreys, of Staunton, Va.; fifth, James; sixth, Samuel, and seventh, Preston. 
Several of these sons reached distinction in the service of the country. Their de- 
scendants are now found throughout the Southern and Western States. (See Foote’s 
Sketches of Virginia, p. 99.) i

Hanover, then embracing all Virginia. The Presbyterian school was then 
intrusted to William Graham, under the supervision of the Rey. John 
Brown, and was removed in 1777 to Timber Ridge, from the region of Mr. 
Brown’s home, near Fairfield. Liberty Hall Academy was chartered in 1782, 
and was endowed by George Washington in 1796. To him it owes the 
names, Washington Academy and Washington College. 
History of Washington College, Virginia, in the American Quarterly 
Register, conducted by B. B. Edwards and W. Cogswell, and pub- 
lished by the American Education Society, Volume X, No. 2, Novem- 
ber, 1837, pp. 145-150. 
This invaluable repository of American educational, ecclesiastical, biographi- 
eal, and Jocal history contains interesting and important extracts from the 
original records of the Presbytery of Hanover, Virginia. It appears that 
the discussion of the project of “ erecting a seminary of learning somewhere 
within their bounds” began as early as October 9, 1771. After various 
postponements, it was decided, October 4, 1773, at Rockfish Gap (wherethe 
site of the University of Virginia was afterward determined), ‘“‘ to fix the 
public seminary for the liberal education of youth in Staunton, Augusta 
County.” Onthe 12th of October, 1774, it was agreed that the proposed in- 
stitution should ‘‘be managed by Mr. William Graham,—a gentleman prop- 
erly recommended to this Presbytery,—and to be under the inspection of the 
Rey. John Brown.” It was stated that there was no person to take the 
management of the school ‘‘in the place first agreed on,” that is, at Staun- 
ton. Committees were appointed to collect subscriptions: ‘Mr. Brown, in 
the Pastures, Providence, and the North Mountain ; Mr. Rice, in Botetourt, 
on thesouth side of James River; Mr. Cummins, in Fincastle; Mr. Irvine, 
at Tinkling Spring, the Stone Meeting-House, and Brown’s Settlement; 
Mr. Wallace, in the fork of James River; and Mr. Smith, at pleasure.” 
This extract gives a local coloring to the efforts of those Presbyterian cler- 
gymen to establish an educational centre in the Valley of Virginia. An 
extract from the records of the Presbytery, dated April 15, 1775, shows that 
the institution was already developing under the direction of the Rev. John 
Brown. ‘‘As the Presbytery have now an opportunity of visiting the school 
under the direction of Mr. Brown, they accordingly repaired to the school- 
house, and attended a specimen of the proficiency of the students in the 
Latin and Greek languages and pronouncing orations, with which they 
were well pleased.” On the 27th of October, 1775, it was agreed that Mr. 
William Graham continue to have the care and tuition of the school, and 
that John Montgomery, “‘late from Princeton College,” be his assistant. 
To understand the origin of Presbyterian colleges in the Southern States, 
one should know that Nassau Hall and the ‘log college” at Princeton, N. J., 
were the original points of departure. Those Scotch Presbyterian minis- 
ters who were so prominent in the educational upbuilding of Virginia and 
Kentucky were Princeton men. This current of influence is very marked. 
The log college in American institutional history is a pioneer type well 
worthy of carefulinvestigation, and the man who undertakes it must study 
the records of Presbyteries. Forexample, the Hanover Presbytery, May 6, 
1776, agreed to accept the offers of Capt. Alexander Stewart and Mr. Samuel 
Houston, in the congregation of Timber Ridge, who propose to give forty 
acres of land apiece for Augusta Academy if it is placed there, and ‘the 
neighbors have offered to build a house of hewn logs, 28 by 24 feet, one and 
a half stories high, besides their subscriptions, and assuring us of the prob- 
ability that the firewood and timber for buildings will be furnished gratis 
for at least twenty years.” This is all as interesting and graphic as the a

order of the General Court of Massachusetts Bay, November 13, 1644, that 
the deputies and elders in every town should urge every family to give one 
peck of corn or twelve pence in money for the college at Cambridge (see 
Records of the Colony Massachusetts Bay, II, 86). The log college upon 
Timber Ridge was opened January 1,1777. The rector had a framed house. 
“They both had well-walled celiars and stone chimneys. Both buildings 
are now (1836) standing, are likely to outlast the present generation, and 
remain as a memorial of the zeal and energy of the Hanover Presbytery.” 
The above facts, which serve to place the original foundation of the Au- 
gusta or Liberty Hall Academy in a clear light, appear to have been drawn 
from the records of the Hanover Presbytery, from the Richmond Religious 
Telegraph for December 19, 1834, January 2, January 23, and February 6, 
1835, and from the life of President Graham, in the Richmond Literary and 
Evangelical Magazine, 1821, p. 75 et seq.

This valuable catalogue, containing a list of the faculty, trustees, and stu- 
dents from the very beginning of the Academy, contains also a valuable 
historical sketch of the institution. The statement is therein made that 
‘‘on the first meeting after the battle of Lexington, the trustees direct the 
record for the 6th of May, 1776, to be entitled ‘ Liberty Hall’—as this acad- 
emy is hereafter to be called, instead of Augusta Academy.” Many of the 
facts mentioned in the preceding note are recorded here, evidently from 
the records of the Hanover Presbytery. This catalogue of the alumni of 
Washington College will prove very helpful to the student who may wish 
to trace the influence of the institution upon Virginia and the South, for it 
gives not merely the names of alumni, arranged chronologically, but also 
their occupations.

happily the character of its early presidents and professors. Lexington in 
war time is graphically pictured, and the story of the ‘‘ boy companies fol-

The Southern Collegian, nineteen volumes. 
This student periodical, representing Washington and Lee University, was es~ 
tablished in 1868, by S. Z. Ammen and C. R. Breckinridge. It is full of 
suggestive materials, illustrating the character and growth of the institu- 
tion. With the second volume the name of the magazine was changed from 
the Collegian to the Southern Collegian, under the editorial direction of 
Charles A. Graves, now a professor of law in the above University. Vol- 
ume IV contains the first literary efforts of Thomas Nelson Page, whose re- 
cent writings are characteristic of Southern life and thought, as well as of 
peculiar local dialects. In the commencement number for 1887 there is a 
remarkable address upon ‘‘The Old South,” delivered by Mr. Page before 
the alumni association of Washington and Lee University, June 14, 1887. 
The main thesis of the address is that “the new South is really the old, with 
its energies directed in new lines.” , 
SUPPLEMENTARY LETTER TO THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The following interesting letter throws additional light upon the 
origin of Liberty Hall Academy! and upon the educational pioneers of 
Virginia and Kentucky.—EDIroR. \ 
“ LOUISVILLE, Ky., October 17, 1887. 
“My DEAR Sir: Iam obliged by yours of the 13th, and only ‘regret 
that my information as to the organization and history of Augusta 
Academy, in Virginia, is quite limited. My great-grandfather, Rev. 
John Brown, came in his youth from County Limerick, Ireland, where 
‘his family, of English extraction, had long been settled. He entered 
Nassau Hall (Princeton), and graduated in 1749 in the second class 
turned out from the college. His diploma, which I found in his old pa- 
pers, has been presented by me to Princeton College as a relic, and is 
now framed and hangs in the college library. The class consisted of 
only two, one being my great-grandfather, the other being the Rev. John 
Todd, afterwards of Louisa County, Va., uncle and preceptor of that 
very extraordinary man Col. John Todd, killed at Blue Licks, in 1782. 
My great.grandfather, John Brown, after his academic graduation, 
studied theology and became a Presbyterian minister. In 1753 he took 
charge of the churches of New Providence and Timber Ridge, in Augusta, 
County, Va., and continued in the pastorate of the former for forty- 
1 The ruins of old Liberty Hall are still standing on a hill about three-quarters of a 
mile west of Washington University, and in full sight of it. They are in an open 
field, some two hundred yards from the road, surrounded by a small grove of trees evi- 
dently younger than the building. The material is grey limestone, and the work- 
manship is admirable. Only the end-walls are standing. They show the building 
to have been three stories high, with low ceilings, rather small rooms, and the upper- 
most story apparently one large dormitory. The walls are very thick. The owner 
values this interesting relic as it deserves, and has protected it from spoliation. The 
photograph was taken by M. Miley, of Lexington, in the fall of 1885.

four years. He then followed his sons, who had long before settled in 
Kentucky, and died at Frankfort, in 1803. His wife was Margaret Pres- 
ton, daughter of John Preston. At the commencement of his pastorate 
he opened an academy, to which he gave greater attention as his own 
sons came to neéd educational care. His home, or rather the home of 
his people, in County Limerick, had borne the name of Liberty Hall 
(I found the place still so called and still inhabited by Browns in 1877), 
and I think it is not a very strained conjecture that the early name of 
‘Liberty Hall” which Washington and Lee College bore, may have had 
something of suggestion in the old man’s memories of his youth. At 
all events, the germ of the college was his school, and his own home, 
the stone walls of which yet exist, was ‘Liberty Hall’ When he 
came to Kentucky, he took charge of Pisgah Church, in Woodford, re- 
siding in the neighborhood. He actively promoted what was known as 
Kentucky Academy, at that place, and was to some extent an instruc- 
tor, but chiefly an emeritus and advisor. The active principal was Mr- 
Moore. This Kentucky Academy, and another institution called ‘ Tran- 
sylvania Academy,’ were blended in 1798 into Transylvania University 
by a legislative act. I think with much satisfaction of my reverend 
ancestor as being a pioneer in educational matters in both Virginia 
and Kentucky. He has left a number of old papers, chiefly. sermons, 
dull and hard toread. But among them is one preached in 1759, to his 
Calvinistic congregation, in which is sounded the first note of question 
of royal authority. It traces the origin of kings, the probable way in 
which hereditary right came to be claimed and recognized, and the 
fallacy of the claim, and concludes with the general proposition that 
governments and governmental institutions have no existence save in 
the consent of the people, and no right to exist except so far as they 
represent the will of the people. It was very bold language for that 
early day. Dr. John Todd! (class-mate of my great-grandfather) be- 
1Rey. Dr. John Todd graduated at Nassau Hall in 1749, in the second class admitted 
toa degree. He was licensed by the Presbytery of New Brunswick in 1750, and was 
sent to the colony of Virginia, at the request of the Rev. Mr. Davies. In the year 
1751 he was ordained by the New Brunswick Presbytery, and on the 22d of April, 
1752, obtained from the general court of Virginia the license required by law for a 
dissenting minister, and became the assistant of the Rev. Samuel Davies. 
After Mr. Davies removed to Princeton, Mr. Todd became the leading minister in 
the Presbytery east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. During the Revolution he was a 
staunch Whig. For a number of years he superintended a classical school in Louisa 
County. 
His nephews, John and Levi Todd, went from Pennsylvania to Virginia, and were 
educated at this school. They both became distinguished citizensof Kentucky. He 
preached in Virginia for forty-three years. In July, 1793, he attended the Presbytery 
in Albemarle County, and on Saturday, the 27th, after its adjournment, set out for 
home. Whether from the infirmities of age or in a fit of apoplexy, is not known, as 
he was alone, riding on horseback, but he was found in the road lifeless. His son, 
bearing his name, was licensed by the Hanover Presbytery, September 13, 1800. 
For some time he supplied the churches left vacant by his father, but in the year 
1809 removed to Kentucky with his family, leaving none of his name in Virginia.

came also a Presbyterian minister, and conducted a famous academy 
in Louisa County, Va. It was at his instance that Dr. Gordon, of Lon- 
don, collected books and apparatus, to form, with Dr. Todd’s addi- 
tions, the library for Transylvania Academy in Kentucky.) This acad- 
emy was, as I have said, united with Dr. Brown’s Kentucky Academy 
in 1798 to form Transylvania University. Dr. Samuel Brown, son of 
my great-grandfather, was one of the first professors of Transylvania 
University. This Dr. Samuel Brown married Miss Perey, of Alabama. 
You are thus, by marriage-with my cousin, allied to two educational 
pioneers, Rev. Dr. John Brown and Rev. Dr. John Todd, and their de- 
scendants may feel glad that their worthy names are to have a chron- 
icler. ‘

FINAL NOTE BY THE EDITOR. 
Colonel Brown’s valuable memoranda are incorporated with the bib- 
liography of Washington and Lee University, appended to the historic 
sketch. An interesting notice of the Rev. John Todd may be found in 
John Mason Brown’s oration, delivered on the occasion of the centen- 
nial commemoration of the battle of Blue Licks, August 19, 1882, and 
published under the auspices of the Kentucky Historical Society. The’ 
worthy Presbyterian divine trained up at his famous classical acad- 
emy in Louisa County, Va., a nephew, John Todd, who afterward be- 
came famous as a leader in border warfare, and as a pioneer of law, 
government, and education in Kentucky. Col. John Todd was one of 
the first two burgesses from the county of Kentucky (created out of 
Newcastle County, December 31, 1776). He was largely instrumental 
in persuading the Virginia Assembly and Patrick Henry, then Gover- 
nor, to commission George Rogers Olark for the conquest of the North- 
west Territory. Colonel Todd took part in that eventful campaign, 
which secured the Northwest to Virginia and the United States, and he 
succeeded Clark in command of the frontier, being’ commissioned “ Col- 
onel Commandant and County Lieutenant.” He appeared in the Vir- 
ginia House of Burgesses in 1780, and was there the successful cham- 
pion of asystem of public education for Kentucky, a system based upon 
land grants. He was one of the earliest advocates of emancipation in 
Kentucky, and favored the exclusion of slavery from the North-west Ter- 
ritory. This noble pioneer of liberty, education, law, and order upon a

dangerous frontier; this friend of Daniel Boone, who with him and a 
few trusty companions first organized government under a great elm- 
tree at Boonesborough, lost his life in the battle of the Blue Licks, with 
the Indians, on the 19th of August, 1782. “In the blood of that 
day were cemented the solid foundations of a powerful State.” The 
coming student of the educational beginnings of Kentucky, the daugh- 
ter of Virginia, will learn more of those remarkable pioneers of Scotch 
Presbyterian ancestry. The Todds and the Browns were men of good 
blood and fine character. (See. Foote’s Sketches of Virginia, second 
series, 44-49, 94-99). Their descendants are numerous, and are now 
scattered throughout the Southwest from Kentucky to Louisiana. The 
Rey. John Brown, principal of Augusta Academy, married the daughter 
of John Preston,! of Staunton, himself the ancestor of a distinguished 
line. Among the first graduates of the old academy were the sons of 
the principal: John Brown, who became a member of Congress from 
Kentucky; James Brown, who became United States Senator from Lou- 
isiana and afterwards minister to France; Samuel Brown, who became 
a professor of medicine in Transylvania University, Kentucky; Pres- 
ton Brown and William Brown, who both became physicians, the one 
in Kentucky, the other in South Carolina, Among the first students 
at the old academy was Archibald Stuart, afterwards a prominent law- 
yer, legislator, judge, and a member of the Virginia Convention in 1788. 
He married a sister of the Rev. John Brown, and was the ancestor of 
the Hon. Alexander H. Hi. Stuart, the present rector of the University 
of Virginia. Blood is thicker than water in Virginia and Kentucky. 
Collins, in his History of Kentucky, Vol. II, p. 183, says that Tran- 
sylvania University, the first literary institution of the West, was estab- 
lished in 1780 by the Legislature of Virginia; one-sixth of the sur- 
veyor’s fees, formerly contributed to the College of William and Mary, 
with 8,000 acres of the first land in the then county of Kentucky, which 
land was to be confiscated, were granted for the endowment and sup- 
port of the seminary. 
Kentucky and Tennessee are fields of educational history which 
should be entered and explored. It will be pioneer work, but none the 
less profitable on that very account. The whole country will be glad 
to see educational inquiries pushed where they are most needed, into 
the North-west and South-west and beyond the Mississippi. 
1 John Preston was a native of. County Derry, Ireland, and,with his wife Elizabeth 
Patton, came to America in 1740, and settled in Augusta County. John Preston died 
in 1747, leaving five children, all of whom were born in Ireland: William, who mar- 
ried Miss Susanna Smith; Letitia, who married Col. Robert Breckenridge; Margaret, 
who married Rey. John Brown; Ann, who married Francis Smith; and Mary, who 
married John Howard, all of whom, except William, emigrated to Kentucky, where 
they left a number of descendants, who have multiplied, and are now found in many 
of the Southern and Western States. (Peyton’s History of Augusta County, p. 303.)

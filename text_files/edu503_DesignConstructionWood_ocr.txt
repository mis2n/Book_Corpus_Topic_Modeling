FOREWORD 
The purpose of the following studies is, (1) to give to be- 
ginners in woodworking an opportunity for the acquisition of skill 
in the handling of tools, and, (II) some practice in designing sim- 
ple projects in wood. 
I. This series of projects is not offered as a hard and fast 
course. The training of the hand does not depend upon following 
a fixed order, like a course in geometry. Many roads lead to the 
goal. This course claims to be a practical one because, tho con- 
stantly changed, it has been a successful one. No greater misfor- 
tune could befall a course in handiwork than that it should be stere- 
otyped. Indeed, my chief misgiving in publishing the course is lest 
it seem to have found final shape. 
To obviate this impression, other projects involving the same 
or similar processes are suggested and illustrated. 
It will be noted that the course here outlined is so planned that: 
1. A variety of woods is employed, each appropriate for its par- 
ticular project\They are: cypress, whitewood, maple, white pine, 
mahogany, chestnut, hickory, sweet-gum, oak, and black walnut. 
2. In general, the technical processes involved inc¢rease in diffi- 
culty thru the series, but esthetic considerations are not sacrificed 
to this formula. 
3. Several types of construction are employed, involving such 
joints as: end-lap, rubbed, miter, middle cross-lap, doweled butt, 
and ledge. 
4. A few simple processes in copper working are included because 
their employment considerably extends the range of useful and orna- 
mental projects available. 
5. A variety of finishes is suggested, including several methods 
of staining, aswell as the use of such polishes as oil, wax, and 
shellac. i : 
In a word, the course involves a considerable variety of experience 
in technical processes.

The attempt is here made to reduce the practice of the shop to 
words and pictures, in order that it may be available to those who 
must work alone. The author, however, does not at all presume to 
believe that, however helpful books may be to the worker, they can 
ever fill the place of individual instruction and demonstration. 
II. In this series all but two of the projects, the picture-frame- 
clamp and the mallet, are such as to invite the worker to create 
his own designs. To this end a considerable number of suggestive 
illustrations are introduced. Design may begin with pure imitation, 
but it never ends there. It is my hope, therefore, that as the stu- 
dent worker proceeds thru the series, he will more and more freely 
design good things. Some general suggestions for help in designing 
will be found in Chapter II, and these are supplemented in each 
succeeding chapter by concrete application of the general principles 
to the project in hand.

WwooD 
Next to food and clothing, wood is to man the most useful of 
substances, and there is no othe*single substance that has as great 
a variety of human uses. The prosperity of any nation is largely 
measured by its timber supply, ind hence we Sec the extraordinary 
efforts now being made by progressive nations to conserve their 
forests. “Today the lumber industry is the, fourth largest industry 
in the United States,)and any intelligent person can quickly make 
a list of scores of uses to which wood is put. ‘Two-thirds of the 
people of the United States live in wooden houses and half of the 
population burn wood as fuel. 
One of the most useful qualities of wood, namely its combusti- 
bility for fuel, also constitutes one of its most serious disadvantages ; 
it is not fireproof. On the other hand, until it is actually burned 
thru, it retains its stiffness, a fact that is not true of hot steel. 
It is because of its destructibility by fire, as well as by insects and 
decay, that attempts are constantly made to find substitutes for it. 
But-even in spite of the employment of such substitutes as cement 
and steel in constructive work, its use is constantly increasing. 
Most of our paper is made of wood and practically all our fur- 
niture. Its great utility depends upon such qualities as its size, its 
strength, its lightness, its ease of working, its elastitity, its hardness 
and its beauty. Oe wood is to be used for building or other con- 
structive work, then its size is of great importance, while in work 
requiring only small pieces, other qualities, such as hardness, or a 
permanence of shape, are determining factors. /The strength of wood 
~ is shown by the ickory bar will stand more pull than a 
wrought iron bar of equal length and weight, and a block of long-leaf 
pine will stand nearly as much crushing weight as a block of cast 
iron of equal height and weight. ) Hickory is so tough that no 
substitutes for it in wheel-spokes, handles and similar articles which 
have to stand constant blows, have as yet been found. The hardness 
13

14 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
and elasticity of such woods as oak and maple make them suitable 
for floors. Some wood, like spruce, that is both light and strong, is 
used for ladders and poles and canoe paddles. 
For ease of working and permanence of shape, no wood compares 
with white pine, “the King of Woods,” but unfortunately this spe- 
cies is now becoming scarce. For the making of furniture, two woods 
now hold supremacy, oak and mahogany. This is due partly to their 
beauty, but also to their strength. The oak is native; the mahogany 
is imported. 
One of the most useful characteristics of wood is its ease of being 
joined together by nails, screws, glue, etc. Woods differ greatly in 
this respect, white pine, yellow poplar, and bass being very easy to 
nail, while oak, hickory, maple, and ash are difficult to nail without 
splitting. In general, the tough elastic woods split badly in nail- 
ing, while the soft brittle woods nail well. Hence, with some 
woods, before nailing, special precautions, like boring holes, have 
to be taken. On the other hand, woods like oak and maple, which 
are difficult to nail can be very securely joined together by means of 
screws. Certain woods, notable among which are mahogany and 
white pine, can be glued together with remarkable tenacity. This 
susceptibility to the cohesive action of glue is a most useful character- 
istic of all our common woods. Soft woods glue much better than hard 
woods. 
One quality, possessed by all wood, is of serious disadvantage, 
namely its sensitiveness to moisture. It shrinks when dry and 
swells when wet. This necessitates particular care in certain forms 
of construction and in methods of finishing. The shrinkage »f wood 
is to be explained by its internal structure. Wood is composed of 
“cells” or fibers, which are long, slender tubes, thru which, during 
the life of the tree, the sap passes. The cells formed during the 
spring of each year grow large with thin walls, and those formed 
in the summer grow smaller with thick walls. A layer of spring 
wood and of summer wood together form an “annual ring” as seen 
in a cross-section of a log, or stripes, as seen in a longitudinal sec- 
tion. Running across these up-and-down cells and radiating out 
from the center of the tree are other cells called “pith rays,” some- 
times very large, as the “silver flakes’ in oak (see frontispiece), 
sometimes very minute as in pine. They serve to bind the annual 
rings together and often, as in beech, sycamore and oak, add great
-P-A-G-E-15
wooD 15 
beauty to the grain of the wood. Now wood shrinks because the 
walls of the cells which compose it become thinner as they dry. 
For some unknown reason wood cells do not become shorter, so that 
wood shrinks very little in 
length. This peculiarity is made 
use of in constructing doors and 
in other panel constructions. 
Wood shrinks most 
cumferentially, that is, in the 
direction of the annual rings, 
and somewhat, radially. This 
explains why boards often warp 
as they do, that is, in the direc- 
tion opposite to that of the an- 
nual rings in them (Fig. 1). A 
board is said to be “warped” 
when one side shrinks more than 
the other. This warping is some- cir- 
times due to the fact that one side is drier than the other. 
  Fig. 1. Boards usually warp in the di- rection opposite to that of the usual rings 
in them. 
In such a 
case the board can often be straightened by drying the other (con- 
  Fig.2. 4, Comb grain board; B, Slash grain board. vex) side. But usually the warp- 
ing is due to the direction of 
the annual rings in it. A “comb 
grain” or “rift” board, Fig. 2, 
which is cut radially in the log, 
is less likely to warp than a 
“slash grain” or “bastard” board 
which is cut from the side of 
the log. 
It is partly for this reason 
that much fine lumber is “quar- 
ter sawed,” Fig. 3. That is, ra- 
dial boards are sawn out first, di- 
viding the log into quarters 
which are then sawed up as 
nearly radially as is consistent with economy. In some woods, as in 
oak and sycamore, the beauty of the grain caused by the exposure 
thus made of the pith rays, is an additional reason for quarter 
sawing. See frontispiece.
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
Disadvantageous as the shrinking and swelling of wood is for 
most purposes, it is sometimes made use of, as in splitting soft 
stone by means of wetting wedges which have been driven into bor- 
ings in the stone. 
The beauty_of wood depends 
largely upon the “grain,” a term___ 
which means several things. Us- 
ually the grain of wood means 
the pattern formed by the dis- 
tinction between the spring 
wood and the summer wood, 
Hence, according to the “figure” 
formed, wood may be straight 
grained, crooked grained, wavy 
grained, curly grained, or bird’s 
eye. The term “grain” may also 
refer to the appearance caused 
Fig 3. Common method of quartering log. by the presence of the “pith 
rays,” as in oak, (see frontis- 
piece), or to the peculiar changing reflection of light due to cross 
grain as in mahogany. The terms coarse grain and fine grain may 
refer respectively either to the 
width of the annual rings or to 
the presence or absence of pores’. 
Wood is sold by the board 
foat; that is, the unit of measure-_ 
ment is a board, one inch thick, 
one foot long, and one foot-wide, 
or 144 cubic inches, Fig. 4. A Hig aeagboarddose 
simple method of measuring is to 
multiply the length in feet by the width and thickness in inches and 
divide by 12. For example 1” (thick) x 8” (wide) X 10’ 0” (long) 
12=6'8” B.M. (board measure). Boards less than one inch 
thick are calculated as one inch. Dressed lumber, that is, planed on 
both sides, comes 3/16” less in thickness than sawn lumber. For ex- 
ample, boards sawn 1” thick are planed to 13/16”. For all ordin-

ary purposes it is economical to buy 13/16” stuff. For thinner boards 
one may have this resawn at the mill.” 
Following are descriptions of a few common varieties of wood. 
As an aid to their recognition, sce the illustrations, frontispiece. 
White pine has been the most useful_of-all-trees~in-the United 
States. The wood is one of the easiest and most satisfactory to work, 
owing to its uniformity of grain. For all purposes that require a 
wood that shrinks and checks but little and holds its shape well, 
such as molding patterns, window sashes, cores of doors and cabinet 
work, white pine is unrivaled. It is very light and soft, and is of 
medium strength, elasticity, and durability. It splits easily but nails 
well. In color it is light brown, almost cream color. The grain is 
not noticeable and has no particular beauty. Hence when used for 
house trim it is usually painted. Its former abundance made it 
cheap and it has therefore been used so recklessly that now it is be- 
coming scarce. Red pine is often sold with and for white pine. 
Price in N. Y. C., 1913, $120 per M (thousand). 
Cypress is a soft, easily worked wood, that does not warp badly 
but is likely to contain many fine checks. It nails well and is very 
‘durable. Hence it is much used for shingles, posts, railway ties, and 
conservatory construction. As seen in slash grain boards, it is often 
beautifully figured by the fine lines of summer wood between the 
broader spaces of spring wood. It has a reddish brown color and no 
resin ducts. Its beauty makes it a desirable wood for interior finish 
and for many pieces of furniture. Price in N. Y. C., 1913, per M. $65. 
Spruce is a straight grained, strong, light, elastic, and rather 
soft wood, which shrinks and warps but little, is easy to plane and 
saw, but hard to chisel neatly across the grain because the spring 
wood is so much softer than the summer wood that it crushes before 
it cuts. It nails fairly well. It is used chiefly for construction, for 
ladders, for paddles, and other articles requiring both strength and 
lightness and, preferably, for paper pulp. It is the wood from which 
sounding boards are made because it is very resonant. It can be sub- 
stituted for many uses of pine. The color is dull white, and the 
rings not noticeable. Very strong, light, furniture can be made of it. 
Price, in N. Y. C., 1913, $50 per M.

18 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
White oak is now the wood most commonly used for interior fin- 
ish and furniture. It is very strong, quite heavy and elastic, and 
hard. It is rather hard to work and to nail, and checks and warps 
considerably, unless carefully seasoned; but when once worked up 
is without a rival on account of its strength and beauty./ The color 
is a light brown. The rings are plainly defined by pores, which 
make a pleasing pattern in slash sawn boards. Its great distinction 
lies in the pith rays, which are broad, conspicuous, and irregular. 
They are often an inch or more wide and many inches long. These 
rays are very hard, almost like horn. They are brought to plainest 
view in radial (or rift) boards, and hence quarter sawing, tho un- 
economical, is commonly practiced to obtain the most effective 
“grain.” As the wood is becoming more scarce, inferior species are 
mixed in, smaller trees are cut, and radial veneers are more and 
more used. In staining, the pores absorb much more color than 
the summer wood or the pith rays, and hence, no wood is capable 
of such contrasts of grain when stained as oak. Price in N. Y.C., 
1913, $135 per M. 
White ash is a heavy, strong, elastic, hard wood, used especially 
for handles of farm tools, oars, barrels, etc. It splits badly in nail- 
ing. It is used considerably for inside finish and furniture both on 
account of its strength and the beauty of its figure when slash sawn. 
The “grain” is due to the massing of the pores in the spring wood. 
It is the hardest and best of the ashes. Black or brown ash is much 
easier to work, and is sufficiently strong for most furniture. Price, 
in N.Y.C., 1913, $85 per M. 
Yellow poplar or white wood grows with a tall straight trunk 
unsurpassed in grandeur by any other eastern American tree. This 
furnishes clear knotless boards, often 15” to 18” broad. It is a gen- 
eral utility wood, largely taking the place once held by white pine, 
and is used for cheap furniture, interior trim, and carriage bodies. 
It is light, brittle, soft, easy to work, nails very well, has medium 
strength, and does not warp badly when properly handled.) The pith 
rays are quite noticeable, but are not made much use of ‘for decora- 
tive purposes. The rings are distinct but not prominent, and the 
color is greenish or yellow brown. It is a good wood to keep in stock 
for all sorts of purposes, and an ideal wood to carve. In the south, 
magnolia is often sold with and for yellow poplar. They belong to 
the same family. Price in N. Y. C., 1913, $80 per M.

Sweet gum. Except for one quality, sweet gum would be one of 
the most useful woods. It has an even texture, is comparatively easy 
to work, takes a beautiful finish and polishes well, is an ideal wood 
for carving, and with a little care can be nailed well. It has a 
beautiful chocolate hue varied by uneven deposits of coloring matter. 
/But it twists and warps more than any other common wood, and hence

of household use, it is an excellent wood. Pricein N. Y. C., 1913,

Mahogany is a general name covering a number of species, all of 
which are imported. The chief varieties are Central American ma- 
hogany, African mahogany, Mexican mahogany, East Indian mahog- 
any (vermillion wood or padouk), and Spanish cedar. These varie- 
ties are somewhat alike in color, a reddish brown, the annual rings 
are inconspicuous, the pores are scattered, and few woods take glue 
better. They vary considerably in hardness, in difficulty of nailing, 
and in shade of color, The common uses are furniture and interior

finish. The grain is very likely to be variable, causing a very pleas- 
ing, changeable, reflection of light. Price in N.Y.C., 1913, $185 per M. 
In the following studies, the woods just described will be recom- 
mended. 
It is impossible to give explicit directions for laying in a supply 
of wood. Some varieties of wood may be plentiful in certain places, 
others may be scarce and hence expensive. Some workers may be able 
to obtain the wood in nearly the sizes wanted; others may be com- 
pelled to purchase whole boards. Some may have a dry storage room 
of ample size, as, for instance, an attic; others may be compelled to 
store their lumber in a damp cellar. In general it may be said 
that one should buy only what he can take good care of. Where any 
quantity of lumber is stored, it should, if possible, be “stacked,” that 
is, piled flat, each board separated from its neighbors by small cross 
sticks to allow free circulation of air. If possible, there should be a 
weight on the top board. Where only a few boards are to be put un- 
der pressure, it is often convenient to clamp them together with 
handscrews, as in Fig. 5.

Cuapter II 
WOOD A-MEDIUM. OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION 
Projects in wood that admit of artistic variation are subject to 
the same fundamental principles of design that underly all the space 
arts. The constant problem of the artistic woodworker is to famil- 
iarize himself with these principles. One way of doing this is the 
keen observation of their application by past and present masters in 
wood. Familiarity with the masterpieces of woodwork in other ages 
and lands will give additional zest and interest to the application of 
these principles. For instance, the hand workers in wood of Italy, 
Spain, France, England, Scandinavia, and Japan, have much to 
teach us in line, proportion, and construction. 
The other way of learning these principles of the space arts is 
by repeated application of them in constructive work. Only in the 
latter way does the worker come to realize the limitations of his own 
medium. \The production of beautiful objects acquires a much more 
lively interest when good taste and the ability to design are developed 
along with manipulative skill in execution./ On the other hand, tne 
acquisition of skill becomes of vastly greater importance if it is used 
as a means of creating things of beauty. 
In a word, artistic judgment and skill of hand develop best when 
they develop together. Each justifies and ennobles the other. 
In the making of the following projects, where ample“ opportun- 
ity is given both to design and to construction, the meaning of beauty 
as related to wooden structures should grow clearer as the articles 
suggested are worked out. Experience here, as elsewhere, is the best 
teacher. , 
It is not to be inferred, however, that one can safely hope to im- 
prove thru self-criticism alone. The dangers of going off at a tan- 
gent are too great. In design, even more than in construction, the 
critical assistance of a competent, teacher is invaluable. The con- 
stant appeal for help to superior artistic judgment is the surest path 
to good taste. 
21  
-P-A-G-E-22
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
The underlying principles of the visual arts have been clearly 
stated, tho not in identical terms, by several writers, and as the 
principles herein suggested for the woodworker are based upon the 
broader principles common to all space arts, the reader is strongly 
urged to familiarize himself with them. They are well analyzed and 
illustrated in the following books: 
Arthur W. Dow: Composition. 
Denman W. Ross: Theory of Pure Design. 
Ernest A. Batchelder: Design in Theory and Practice. 
George Lansing Raymond: Proportion and Harmony of Line and Color. 
Lewis F. Day: The Application of Ornament. 
  The properties of the particular medium thru which art is ex- 
pressed present to the artist certain limitations which he must recog- 
nize. This in no way suppresses creative expression, but rather dis- 
ciplines it. 
The following, then, are the possibilities and the limitations 
within which the woodworker may revel: 
1. In the first place, the thing to be made should in itself appeal 
to the craftsman as something worth while and interesting to make. 
For instance, scrap-baskets, picture-frames, desk-trays, hanging lan- 
terns, and such familiar objects as are frequently seen or handled, 
should call forth the worker’s best effort. 
2. The article to be made should be so designed and constructed 
as to be structurally sound. Nothing is completely beautiful which 
is poorly constructed. The joints of a frame should not open with 
varying temperature and humidity. A chair should be so con- 
structed as to hold the weight and strain ordinarily expected of 
chairs, for an indefinite time, or as long as the wood lasts. A hun- 
dred years is not too long to expect a chair to be of service. Many 
last longer. 
3. The form of the article should frankly indicate the material; 
wood should not be made to look like metal or stone. Appropriate- 
ness of shape to material should be so obvious that there would be 
no mistaking a wooden candlestick for one of pottery or brass. 
4. The structure of the article should be recognized or even 
emphasized, but not contradicted. In wooden structures this prin- 
ciple has to do primarily with the matter of joints. Joints may in 
many cases be made obvious, as in the decorative use of fastenings,
-P-A-G-E-23
  
WOOD A MEDIUM OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION 23 
so that there is no mistaking the form of construction. In cases 
where the joint is concealed, the principle stated would demand that 
there be no pretense of a form of construction that does not exist, 
as, for example, when a false keyed mortise-and-tenon joint is stuck 
on where the pieces are actually doweled together. In a word, the 
construction should be honest, and if it is obviously honest, it may 
be all the better. 
5. The article should also be convenient for use. The socket of a 
candle stick should be of the proper size to hold ordinary candles. 
A pen-tray should be long enough to hold pens and pencils and 
should not be easily upset. A chair seat should be the right distance 
from the floor, and the rail in front should be high enough to allow 
the sitter to slip his feet under it and so rise easily. The require- 
ments of convenience set limitations to design. Proportions must 
conform to intended use. 
6. Lastly, when an interesting object has been chosen, when 
proper materials and sound construction have been determined upon, 
when it has been planned for convenience in use, so that the size and 
shape are approximately fixed, then the sense of beauty plays, as it 
were, with these possibilities, feeling for the most satisfying propor- 
tion of parts to whole and parts to each other, trying one arrange- 
ment after another, studying how to secure a rhythmic repetition of 
the same motive, how to break up an outline or a surface harmon- 
iously into principal and subordinate parts, and how to keep it as 
a unit well balanced. 
In analyzing more particularly what it is with which the crafts- 
man plays in creating beauty in these little wooden structures, four 
considerations are of prime importance: (1) mass, (2) line, involv- 
ing light and_shadow,(3)..color, (4) finish. 
1. Mass. The first consideration is the appearance of the object 
as a whole. It is to be thought of as a silhouette, as an object stand- 
ing between the observer and the light, so that the general propor- 
tions are obvious; that is, the relation of width to height, of part to 
whole, and of part to part, including a consideration of vacant spaces 
as well as occupied spaces, should be clearly defined. Seen or imag- 
ined from this point of view, the details are lost, no lights or shad- 
ows are conspicuous, but only the general mass. It must have the 
beauty that one sees when the trees, rocks, and hills are silhouetted 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
in a pattern of pleasing proportions against a twilight sky. In other 
words, the first and fundamental esthetic test and requisite is that 
the proportions as a whole should be pleasing. 
The basket, candlestick, lantern, and so on, which in the follow- 
ing pages are suggested for making, are studied from this point of 
view ; they are planned to keep the height and width and depth in 
pleasing relation each to each, and to so proportion open with closed 
spaces as to secure an artistic arrangement of parts. In other words, 
the composition made by placing the object against a lighter or dark- 
er surface should be pleasing in dark and light. 
2. Line. When these general masses and spaces are approxi- 
mately determined, the next step is to fix the character of their 
boundaries. The outlines are to be refined and embellished, and 
here we may have all the variety that lies between that severity of 
line found in the earlier European furniture—whether Scandinavian, 
Italian, Spanish or English, and the elaborateness of carved and 
turned and fluted styles, such as is characteristic of the later Eliza- 
bethan or Gothic furniture. How simple or how intricate, how bold 
or how delicate the lines shall be, depends partly upon the nature of 
the material, partly upon the skill and the judgment and the taste of 
the craftsman, and partly upon the use to be made of the object. 
The nature of the line affects directly the high lights and shad- 
ows that appear when the object is well lighted. Good lines will 
produce interesting notes of light and dark. They will “catch the 
light” and “throw shadows” at pleasing rhythmic intervals, making 
interesting patterns in “notan”. ‘This is the merit of artistic mold- 
ings, turned work, carving, and inlay, that they make possible intri- 
cate and diversified compositions of dark and light (and in the 
case of inlay, of color), that are impossible in severe, plain styles. 
On the other hand, the attractiveness of plain forms lies in their 
very simplicity. Moreover, as the plainer early European or Japan- 
ese styles involve fewer elements to be spaced, the chances for the 
beginner to get better designs in them is greater than in the more 
elaborate styles. So, until considerable mastery in handling space 
relations in wooden structures is gained, the beginner is advised to 
work in the spirit of these plainer, simpler styles. 
*Notan—a Japanese term meaning dark-and-light.

WOOD A MEDIUM OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION 25 
3. Color. Thirdly, there is the consideration of color. The nat- 
ural hues of the woods give a considerable variety, ranging from the 
light yellow brown of oak, chestnut, and ash, to the reds of mahog- 
any and the purples of walnut and sweet gum. All of these can be 
greatly modified artificially by stains or by chemical processes. (See 
the author’s Handwork in Wood, pp. 209-214.) 
The problems in color, both in hue and value, is that of harmony 
with surroundings. No piece of furniture, however small, should be 
considered as a thing by itself. It is to be treated as one element that 
will enter into the composition of a beautiful room, and upon its 
harmony therewith will depend its own beauty. 
As regards the color of furniture, it may be said in general that 
the esthetic tendency is away from yellow tones. These are all the 
harder to avoid on account of the yellowness of the common finishes, 
varnish and shellac. The best that can be done by amateurs is to 
gray the yellow by fuming or staining. On the other hand, a frank 
yellow tone may be appropriate and effective, as, for instance in a 
blue setting. 
4, Finish. The fourth element of beauty in wood is finish. The 
simplest and oldest process is rubbing with or without oil or wax, 
which only emphasizes the quality of wood as wood. The more mod- 
ern finishes, varnish and shellac, succeed in “bringing out the grain,” 
but at the expense of making a surface that looks, not like wood, but 
like glass. Unlike glass, however, varnish is easily marred. To keep 
the shining surface perfect, demands constant protection and care, 
and suggests that such pieces are made, not to use, but to look at. 
It may frequently happen that in order to secure a desired ef- 
fect of mass or line or color, the design or construction originally 
adopted may have to be reconsidered and something else substituted 
that will give a satisfying harmony. Each feature is thus to be de- 
cided tentatively, subject to such modifications as other features may 
demand in securing unity of design for the structure when complete. 
Altho the steps mentioned seem to give the logical procedure in 
building all sorts of things, whether foot-stools, chairs, or thrones, 
trussed, arched, or suspension bridges, dog-kennels, cottages, or cas- 
tles, yet a little reflection and observation will show that one or 
another of these steps has frequently been omitted. The library of 
one of our famous universities is a good illustration of a beautiful    
-P-A-G-E-26
  
  26 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
building poorly planned for its use. Utility is sacrificed to good 
proportion. On the other hand, the so-called typewriter chair is a 
model of convenience and comfort, but it will never find a place in a 
museum as a thing of beauty. Utility has not yet been cast in pleas- 
ing line and tone. 
The following, then, is suggested as a logical method of proced- 
ure in designing simple wooden structures. In actual experience it 
is not necessary to decide these points in this order, or in any order, 
but in general these are the items that should receive deliberate con- 
sideration at some time between the conception and completion of an 
artistic structure. 
I. The fiwing of essentials, or of those points that make for an 
article’s convenience in use. Under this head, such matters as the 
following are determined: 
a. The approximate or definite size. 
b. The kind of wood to be used. Each has a quality that 
makes its characteristic appeal for certain construc- 
tions. See Chapter I, also Chapter III, Wood and 
Forest. 
ce. The construction, including: 
(1) Kind of joint or joints. 
(2) Methods of opening and shutting or locking. 
(3) Appliances for lifting or moving or hanging, 
and so on. 
Il The refining of proportions. 
a. Of the mass as a whole. 
b. Of each part to the whole. 
e. Of each part to each other part. 
d. Of each line within itself, if it curves or is a broken 
line, or is turned on a lathe. 
III. Decoration. This relates to the decorative treatment of the 
surface. 
a. Carving, border or surface (all-over) patterns in 
gouged lines or modeled. 
b. Panels, carved in, or constructed in. 
e. Inlay or veneer. 
d. Designing of accessories—handles, knobs, key plates, es- 
cutcheons, ete.

IV. Finish. 
a. Stain. 
b. Paint. 
e.. Oil. 
d. Wax. 
e. Shellac, including French polish. 
f. Varnish. 
In general, the order in designing suggested above has been fol- 
lowed thruout the making of the following articles. The illustra- 
tions used are largely photographs or sketches of articles designed 
and executed by my students. 
However, the possibilities for original design that lie within the 
range of these few objects of household use still invite the designer. 
There is here no intention of a cut and dried series of models, but 
rather such a presentation of what some of the possibilities of these 
projects are, that others to whom wood appeals as a medium of ar- 
tistie expression will be stimulated to create still more varied and 
beautiful objects for our common every-day life. Or, feeling not 
too sure of his ability to create, the beginner may choose from the 
following suggestions the ones he likes best, in itself an exercise of 
artistic judgment, and copy them. And so, little by little in the 
effort to re-create others’ designs that are known to be good, he may 
come to create good designs of his own. Or, at the very least, which 
is also much, thru this thoughtful copying of good things, he will be 
helped in his desire to appreciate beauty in wooden structures.

EQUIPMENT 
The equipment necessary for beginning to work in wood may be 
very inexpensive, costing not more than $25. It is better to begin 
with a few good tools, well chosen, adding to the number others as 
they are needed. The total cost of a first class equipment need not 
exceed $50.00. 
It is rarely wise to buy the sets already made up in cabinets, for 
the lists given often include cheap and dispensable tools, and the 
quality is apt to be not the best. One can soon learn to make a cabi- 
net to fit his own tools. It is wise to consult one’s local hardware 
dealer before buying as well as those firms that have made a spe- 
cialty of handling woodworking equipments for schools and ama- 
teurs. The latter have special facilities for furnishing the proper 
high grade tools. The names and addresses of reliable firms may 
be found in the advertising pages of any of the educational journals‘. 
The following tools are recommended for the individual equip- 
ment of a beginner’: 
The bench. The essential features of a good bench are: (1) Ri- 
gidity. This may be secured in a bench made with either mortise- 
and-tenon-joints, Fig. 6,A, or draw-bolt construction, Fig. 6,B. The 
bench should be firmly fastened to the floor by lag-screws passing 
thru the two foot pieces. 
(2) A maple top with trough at the back. 
(3) A low tool rack, that is, one not above the top of the bench, 
which does not obscure the light and is not in the way for large work. 
(4) A good vise. The strongest, most durable, and most con- 
venient are the rapid-acting vises, with the working parts of metal, 
which require an occasional oiling.

The jaws of the vise should be faced with maple. Sometimes 
there are two vises, a side vise and a tail vise. The latter is exceed- 
ingly convenient for certain kinds of work. 
There are various benches and vises on the market. Among other 
good ones are those of the following firms: 
E. H. Sheldon & Co., 182 Nims St., Muskegon, Mich.

These benches at this price are all equipped with a side and a 
tail vise, the last with a Toles rapid-acting vise. The rapid-acting 
vise adds about $6.00 to the cost, and by special order they may be 
attached to any standard bench. Among the many rapid-acting vises 
on the market are the W. C. Toles, Irving Park, Chicago, Ill.; The 
Abernathy Vise & Tool Co., 233 W. 62d Place, Chicago, Ill.; The 
Herriman Oo., 15 8. Canal St., Chicago, Ill.; the Richards-Wilcox 
Co., Aurora, Ill. 
A very good arrangement is to have a rapid-acting side vise, and 
wood-screw tail vise. 
In a word, the bench and vise may cost from $8.00 to $20.00.

Fulton St., N.Y. 
The Bridgeport Wood Finishing Co., Penetrating Oil Stain, 1 
pint, 20c, 155 Fulton St. 
Wax. The easiest finish to apply and repair is wax. A conven- 
ient prepared form is: 
Bridgeport Wood Finishing Company’s Old Dutch Finish, price, 
25¢ a pint. 
Supplies. Nails, screws, ete., are now commonly put up in con- 
venient packages, and would better be purchased as needed. Explicit 
directions will be given in each lesson as to what to obtain. A box 
divided into compartments, or a set of boxes so divided, which may 
be stacked in a set of drawers, will add greatly to the convenience of 
handling nails and screws. Until this is provided they may be kept 
in their paper packages”. 
Glue. “Star” glue (imported) is the strongest, but it sets quickly. 
Peter Cooper’s White Glue is excellent, and comes in convenient form.

A SCRAP-BASKET 
In designing a scrap-basket, matters for early consideration are: 
I. The fiving of the essentials. 
a. Of these the size must be approximately determined at the 
beginning. For ordinary purposes a waste-basket should not: be more 
than 18” or less than 14” high, depending—so far as looks go—upon 
the size of the desk beside which 
it is likely to stand. As to 
breadth, it may be properly be- 
tween 7” and 10”, depending on 
the height. The shape may be 
square, Fig. 9, the easiest con- 
struction; or six sided, Fig. 7; 
or eight sided; or square with 
the corners cut, Fig. 8. 
b. The next point to de- 
cide is the kind of wood to be 
used. Pine is easier for a be- 
ginner to work, but it is more 
expensive than cypress or spruce. 
Cypress is softer than spruce 
and hence easier to work, and 
has a pleasing grain. On the 
other hand, spruce is stronger. 
Take it all in all, cypress an- 
swers more requirements. The e - 
more expensive and harder cab- Wie Rete bakes. 
inet woods, oak and mahogany, are all right for the experienced 
worker. 
c. As to the construction, the simplest is the best; the slats are 
nailed to the flat bottom and to a frame consisting of a band of cleats 
. at or near the top. If the cleat is made as in Fig. 9 this band or

  36 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
rail may be boxed together very strongly with an end-lap joint as 
described below. If the rail is outside the slats, a miter joint should 
be used for appearance sake, Fig. 10. If the top is finished with a 
nosing, as in Figs. 10 and 17, the frame will serve as a ready means 
of lifting the basket. On the other hand, if the basket is finished 
with the frame inside it is more 
conveniently lifted if handles 
of wood or copper or leather 
are added on two opposite sides. 
See Figs. 8 and 11. 
Il. Proportions. With these 
essentials fixed, we pass to the 
refining of the proportions. 
The proportion of width to 
height should be subtle, not ob- 
vious, as 1 to 2 or 2 to 3. The 
width may be increased by 
changing the number of the 
slats or the spaces between 
them. To vary the width of the 
slats themselves increases the 
difficulty of planing which, for 
Fig 10. Basket with mitered a beginner, is better kept easy. frames at top and bottom. Various arrangements of slats 
are shown in the illustrations. 
A variety of designs is possible by changing the position and 
width of the frame. By putting it at the very top of the slats with 
a mitered nosing over both slats and cleats, a neat substantial fin- 
ish is obtained. Fig. 13. If the frame is lowered, some of the slats 
may be cut to different lengths and so shaped as to make a pleasing 
outline at top and bottom. Fig. 19. By the same method a handle 
may be introduced, Fig. 15. 
III. Decoration. Several features may be added for decorative 
purposes as, for example, feet at the corners, perhaps with a little 
line carving, Fig. 9; lacing, instead of nailing at the corners, Fig. 7; 
not to speak of the handles already mentioned. For those who have 
facilities for working in copper, well designed handles and corner 
braces give an added charm to the appearance of the basket. — 
     
-P-A-G-E-37
  
A SCRAP-BASKET 37 
The use of upholstery nails, or large copper tacks (120z.), with 
the heads hammered into knobs or filed square, gives an artistic touch. 
See Figs. 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 18. 
IV. The Finish. The stain chosen should make the basket har- 
monize with its surroundings. Soft browns and grays are the safest. 
Dull red or gray-green 
may be suitable. Finally 
the basket may be 
waxed or oiled as de- 
scribed below. 
The following direc- 
tions describe the mak- 
ing of the basket shown 
in Fig. 9. 
The scrap basket is 
chosen for the first pro- 
ject because it involves 
much sawing and plan- 
ing, both of which pro- 
cesses it is essential to 
master at the outset. 
Moreover the pianing 
is chiefly narrow-sur- 
face planing, which is 
easier for the beginner 
than broad - surface 
planing. Furthermore, :

I. Getting out material. For this first project select a. piece of 
wood that is free from knots, and smoothly planed on both sides. 
- The first step is 
o get 2 pieces, 
16” long and 8” 
wide. If you can 
get them exactly 
6” long at a 
mill, do so; ex- 
erience in mak- 
ing lengths will 
come better later 
after some prac- 
ice in handling 
ools. If you 
must get out the 
proper lengths 
yourself, buy one 
oard 4’ 0” long,

ollows: Select the straightest 
edge of the board, and with the 
help of the try-square, draw a 
encil line at right angles to

II. Planing the edges. The next 
step is to plane one edge of each 16” 
piece perfectly straight and square with 
a broad surface. To do this proceed as 
follows: Put one piece in the vise, long 
edge up, and clamp it firmly. Attend to 
the adjustments of your jack-plane.

these, there are 3 principal ones. 1, the

clamp screw (5) and the thumb

pushed down tight. Now turn 
over the plane and look along 
the “sole” as in Fig. 21, and see 
that the cutter barely projects.

far, bring it back by turning the brass set-screw (8). If one cor-

adjust it by means of the lever for 
lateral adjustment (9). Now try 
the plane on the wood. Grasp the 
handle (11) firmly in the right 
hand, and the knob (12) firmly in 
the left hand. Place the bottom or 
sole (16) on the edge of the piece 
in the vise, so that only the toe (17) 
(the part in front of the cutter), 
rests on the wood. Press down hard 
on the knob and push the plane for- 
ward. When the plane rests firmly 
on the wood, press equally on the 
knob and handle and then as the 
toe passes off the wood, press only 
on the handle. Finish the stroke 
with a slight upward swing of the 
handles and curner braces and withfeet_ plane. Be especially careful not to of carved blocks. 
press down on the heel (18) at the 
beginning or on the toe at the end of the stroke. If you do, the sur- 
face which you are planing will not be straight but convex. Test 
the edge with the straight arris (the external angle formed by the 
union of two surfaces) of the plane, looking to- 
ward the light. (Fig. 23.) If the light does 
not come evenly between the edge of the board 
and the arris of the plane, plane off only the 
high part. Now test the edge for squareness, 
pressing the head of the try-square firmly 
against the side of the board and sliding it 
down until the blade just touches the edge, 
Fig. 24. Do this at several points along 
the edge, noticing which, if either, arris is higher 
than the other. If the left hand arris is higher, 
take off a shaving along that arris using only 
the right half of the cutter, that is, letting the

the grain.” In that case simply reverse the piece. 
Repeat this operation on the other similar 16” piece. Put a pen- 
cil mark, thus =, on this edge for identification. 
If you obtained your pieces from the mill exactly 16” long, and 
sawed square, the next two steps 
may be omitted. If you sawed 
off the two pieces yourself, their 
ends must be squared. To do 
this fasten one piece in the vise, 
end up. Cut off diagonally with 
the knife or chisel the arris 
(corner) away from the edge al- 
ready planed for about 4”, as 
shown in Fig. 26.

ting off an arris is called a

This end must now be tested not only for straightness and for square- 
ness with the surface, but for squareness with the edge already planed,

away from the finished edge and 
proceed as before. 
Finally plane the other edge, 
taking pains to make it perfectiy 
parallel to the first edge. Repeat 
all these processes on the other 
16” piece. 
III. Laying out the slats. 
We are now ready to lay out 
the slats for the basket. This 
is done by drawing gage lincs 
on the two opposite faces of 
both boards. To do this pro- 
ceed as. follows: 
The lines are to be drawn 
as shown in Fig. 28. The spur 
of the marking-gage should project 
an inch and should be sharpened (

at 3/16” and tighten the

with the beam resting on one arris, Fig. 29, and the head sliding along 
the edge of the board (as in Fig. 214, Handwork in Wood). 
Now little by little roll the 
beam toward you until the spur 
just begins to scratch. By prac- 
ticing in this way for a: little 
while, you wil] soon learn to 
gage a line parallel with the 
edge. The difficulty that most 
beginners experience comes from 
trying to scratch a deep tine at 
once, and in not getting the 
pressure behind the spur. The 
Fig. Beets cae seapay prevent splin- finest line that is visible is best. 
As the distance between the spur 
and the head of the gage increases, so does the difficulty of holding 
the gage steadily. If you are not succeeding well, practice on only 
one board, and if the resuit is 
too bad, plane off the scratched 
surface, and try again and again 
until you can use the gage weil. 
(See p. 48 for broad surface plan- 
ing.) It is better to lose one 
board than two. 
Now gage this 3/16” line on 
both broad surfaces from the same 
edge. Then others on both 
broad surfaces from the other 
edge, and then others on the 
other 16” board in the same way. 
Now add 4”, setting the gage 
at 7/16” and gage again the 
eight lines. Then add another 
3/16", making 5%” and gage 
again. Add another 4”, and so 
on, until you have 28 3/16” spaces.

both boards.

IV. Ripping off the slats. 
When the two boards are prop- 
erly gaged, they are next to he 
rip-sawed up into slats. The 
saw kerfs are to be down the 
middle of the %4" spaces. To 
be sure of making no mistake, 
it is well to draw a pencil line 
where the kerfs are to be. 
To saw proceed as follows: 
Fasten one board in the vise as 
in Fig 30, 7. e., with the jaws 
  of the vise pressing the edges 
of the board, and the board in- 
clined back from the perpendicular. Fig. 28. Gaged lines on piece to be sawed into slats. The saw-kerfs are to be in the middle of the 4" spaces. 
Rest the left hand on the top 
end of the board with the thumb so held that it acts as a guide in 
  Fig. 29. How the beam of a marking- gage runs on its arris starting the saw. The saw to be 
used is the rip-saw (see Handwork 
in Wood, p. 63). Hold it in the 
right hand so that the line of the 
teeth and the surface of the board 
make quite an acute angle; that 
is, drop the right hand down as 
low as possible. Put the saw in 
proper position for making the 
cut, and be careful to hold up the 
saw so that the teeth will rest 
on the arris as lightly as possi- 
ble. If these directions are followed, it will not be necessary to make 
a false start by drawing the saw toward you, but the first stroke will 
be a push and   
will cut properly. 
Now saw away 
the pencil line in 
the middle of the 
Y4” space, watch- 
ing the line 
closely and also 
looking on the |      
  . Ripping with wood held in vise.

a te Wee. en eke ste thy, 
46 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
back to see if the kerf is in the middle of the space. If the saw tends 
to “run” to one side of the line, say the right side, pull it back nearly 
to its point, twist the handle a little to the left, and take a few short 
strokes until the kerf is in the proper place again. If the cut is going 
badly on the back, it may be necessary to turn the board back side 
front, until the kerf is right there. 
Saw about half way thru the board, then turn the other end up 
and saw the other half. 
After sawing off the strip, put the board in the side-vise, sawn 
edge up, and plane it down to the next gage line, being careful not to

go below it and yet to make the edge true. This is slightly more diffi- 
cult than it was to plane it true in the first place. Then saw off 
another strip as before, plane up the edge of the board, and so on, 
until the necessary number of strips (28) have been sawn off. By 
this time one should know how to rip-saw well. By cutting 14 slats 
from each board, a part of each board will be left which should be 
saved to be used later for the frame. 
V. Planing up the slats. The slats are now to be planed on the 
side still rough. If your bench has a tail vise, fasten one of the 
strips between the stop in the vise and the bench-stop, placed in that
-P-A-G-E-47
  
A SCRAP-BASKET 47 
hole which is at the right distance, and plane it to the proper thick- 
ness. The same can be done between the vise-dog and the bench- 
stop in the Sheldon vise, but since the parts are of iron, special pains 
must be taken to prevent the plane cutter from hitting the iron. To 
avoid this danger, put in a temporary wooden bench-stop. Another 
device for facilitating the planing of these thin 
strips, is shown in Fig. 31 and can be readily 
made, as follows: 
In any convenient piece of wood, 18” or so 
long, cut adado 1” deep, and 1” from one end, just 
wide enough to hold tightly a thin strip of wood 
(say 76” wide). Let the distance AB be %” less 
than the length of the strips to be planed up. In- 
sert this device between the vise-dog and the bench- 
stop letting the strip to be planed lie in the space 
A-B. Raise the vise-dog so that it will engage the 
strip. Then tighten the vise just enough to hold it 
firmly. Plane up all the strips to the required thickness. If any are 
spoiled, as is likely to be the case, in this first project, make others, 
but save the spoiled ones until the basket is done. 
Next trim off the arrises (corners) at one end of each of the slats, 
see Fig. 32. First mark carefully 1%” from the end and then draw 
the diagonal with a 
sharp pencil and the 
sliding Tee-bevel. The 
neatest way to cut this 
angle is by slicing it off 
with a chisel, see Fis. 
33. Cut these angles 
at one end only. 
VI. Making the bet- 
tom. Inasmuch as the 
thickness of the origi- 
Slicing off an arris with a chisel: nal boards and hence 
the width of the slats 
may not be exactly 74”, in order to find out the exact size of the bot- 
tom proceed as follows: Lay seven slats close together, side by side, 
measure their total width and add six times 3/16”, (the space he- 
  Fig.32. End of slat. 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
tween the slats) or 14%” in all. The total is the exact size of the 
bottom. Let us assume that the slats are exactly 74” wide. Then 
the proper size for the bottom will be 44” x74" x74". This is to 
be made next, and this involves 
broad surface planing. Fasten 
the board flat on the bench, be- 
tween. the tail-vise-dog and the 
proper bench-stop, the grain 
running lengthwise of the 
bench. If the board is at all 
warped, plane the convex side 
first. Before beginning to plane, Fig. 34. Testing a planed surface for flat- ness by using the arris of the plane. glance down the sole of the 
plane, Fig. 21, to see that the 
cutter projects evenly and but very little beyond the sole. Test the 
surface for flatness by placing the long arris of the plane on the 
surface in various directions, lengthwise, crosswise, and diagonally 
and looking toward the light, as in Fig. 34. If there are high places, 
plane them off first. Work carefully, planing only such parts as nee 
it. When the surface is flat, plane 
over the whole surface from end 
to end, working from left to 
right, and back again until the 
whole surface is smoothed. Mark 
this surface with a single mark, 
thus: —. This indicates the 
“working face.” Now plane one 
edge true and mark it with two 
marks, thus=. This indicates 
the “working edge.” It is import- 
ant to form early this habit of 
marking one’s work. Next draw 
with a sharp pencil and a straight 
edge, a line 714” from, and paral- Sed ere anuaret ot 
lel to the working edge. Since 
this distance exceeds the number of inches on the marking-gage, 
the most convenient method is to measure the distance near each end, 
and at right angles to the working edge, and then to rule a light 
      
    
   
-P-A-G-E-49
  
A SCRAP-BASKET 49 
line between these two points. Next score with the knife and try- 
square, as in Fig. 35, a line near one end of the piece. The working 
face will now appear as in Fig. 36. 
Cut off the corner A, as in Fig. 36, put the piece end up in the 
side vise, and plane off the end to the scored line. Test this end 
with the try- 
square, to see 
that it is square 
with both the 
working face and 
the working edge. 
Then measure ex- 
actly the length, 
714", and score it 
with knife and 
try-square. Cut 
off the corner 
outside the width = : A Fig. 36. How the working face loots when marked for

up the other end. Plane the width, 714”, to the ruled line. Use the 
try-square constantly for testing. The piece should now be perfectly 
square. To verify your measurement see that the diagonals are equal 
in length. AC = BD. 
With the marking-gage set at 34”, gage from the working face 
both edges and both ends of the board. Now plane down the other 
broad surface to the line thus gaged, being very careful not to plane 
any portion too much. The best way is to plane off the high places 
first and then by working back and forth across the board to reduce 
the whole surface evenly. Stop when you have just split the gaged 
line. 
VII. Making the frame. The next step is to get ready the 
frame, which binds the slats together near the top. From one 
of the pieces left from making the slats, dress up one piece, 7%” 
thick, 134” wide, and 16” long. Smooth the two broad surfaces, 
taking as fine shavings as possible. 
Plane true one edge of the piece, and gage a line 134” from the 
edges. Saw off the surplus and plane to the line. Now gage two 
lines, 5/16” from each broad face. Saw between these two lines, and

plane up the rough surfaces. Each of the two strips should be 5/16” 
thick. Cut each of these in two crosswise in the center making 4 cleats. 
The pieces made thus far may now be sandpapered. Tear a sheet

  of No. 1 sand- 
paper into four 
pieces. An easy 
way to do this is 
to place it, sand 
down, so that the 
middle of the 
sheet lies along 
the front arris of 
the bench. With 
the left hand 
hold the part on 
the bench down 
flat. With the 
right hand hold- 
ing the other 
half give a quick 
downward stroke which will tear the paper straight in two, Fig. 37. 
Repeat on each half. Fold one quarter neatly around a small block

every surface of each piece, and also touch off the sharp arrises. 
VIIla. Making the frame (end lapped). First with a couple of 
brads (114” No. 15) nail all four cleats together, keeping the sides 
and one end perfectly flush, 
and letting the heads project 
so that the brads can be re- 
moved later. Then saw them 
together in the miter-box to 
exactly the length of one side 
of the bottom 74”. Next 
measure carefully 5/16” from 
both ends and draw a line half 
across on one surface, and con- 
nect with these lines two other 
center lines as at A B, Fig. 38. 
Place the bunch in the miter- 
box again, and saw on the out- 
side of the lines A B, and care- 
fully chisel out these returns. 'ake the cleats apart and each will 
appear as C D in Fig. 38. Now nail the four together into a frame, 
reversing two of them so that the projection of two of them will 
fit into the return of the next ones as H# in Fig. 38. Nail both ways. 
VIILb. Making the frame (mitered). If the cleats binding the 
slats together are fastened, not inside of the slats, but outside, as in 
Fig. 10, the ends should be mitered. 
Mitering is done in the miter-box. If you have a simple wooden 
one, fasten it in the vise so that it will be rigid, as in Fig. 39. Place

Each cleat will now be of the shape

cleat to see that the end is square 
with the edge, and that all are 
of the same length. If not, the 
ends can be trimmed with a chis-

is shown in Fig. 41. Place the 
cleat, long side down, on bench- 
hook, the acute angle against 
cleat of the bench-hook. With 
chisel pare off sawn mitered sw -

all four cleats are alike, 77g” long, and with a true 45° miter at 
each end. In order to test this, set your sliding Tee-bevel at an 
angle of 45°, as follows: Measure accurately both ways from the

thus: With the scratch awl or a 
sharp nail draw a center line (di- 
ameter) thru a piece of tin 
2” x 214". On this center line lay 
off four 3%” spaces. With the 
scratch awl and sliding Tee-bevel 
set at 45°, draw oblique lines 
both ways from the center line as 
shown in Fig. 43. With the snips 
(or a pair of strong scissors) cut 
out the four braces in the shape 
shown in Fig. 44. Each one 
should be just less than 5/16” 
wide. With a small nailset punch 
four holes in each piece as shown Fig. 43. Lay-out of the tin braces. 
in Fig. 44. The best way to do this is by placing the tin on a piece of 
lead, but a piece of hard wood will do. Do not use the top of the 
bench. Then flatten out tie vs. 
Next nail together the frame 
by means of the tin braces aaa 
the 5%” flat head nails as showu 
in Fig. 45. The joints may alse 
be strengthened by driving braas 
(%", No. 18) at ABC. Fig. 45. 
To do this fasten one piece 2 
firmly in the vise, end up, start 
the nails A and B in the other 
piece (Y). Force the end of piece Y a little beyond the end of .Y, so 
that when the brad is driven home the outer arrises of the miter will 
just meet. Do this with all the 
corners, and lay aside. 
IX. Assembling. The parts 
are now ready to be assembled. 
On one long arris of one of the 
slats, lay out with a sharp pencil 
and a rule, the position of the 
slats as in Fig. 46. Using this as 
a pattern, lay out the same dis- Fig. 45. Tin brace nailed to cleats.

tances on all the upper arrises of the bottom, and on the correspond- 
ing arrises of the frame. Next, nail the slats to the bottom piece, as 
in Fig. 47, driving only one brad (7%” No. 18) thru each slat, and 
that one a little away from the center, so as not to interfere with the

upholstery nail, which will be driven in later, and yet near enough 
to the center so that it will be covered by the head of the upholstery 
nail. The lower end of each slat will be just flush with the lower 
surface of the bottom. 
The next step is to nail the slats to the cross-cleats which have 
already been joined together into a frame. 
Measure 114” from the top end of the four corner slats on the 
inside. Lay the basket on its side and drive brads from the inside 
of the basket thru the cross-piece just far enough into the corner 
slats to hold the frame in place. Later these brads are to be removed. 
See that the basket stands square in all parts. Now with upholstery 
nails, nail each slat in its proper place to the frame. These nails 
should be in two rows, so disposed that the point of each nail is in 
the vertical center of the slat, and half an inch from one edge of the 
frame, as shown in Fig. 48. 
In order to have something solid to nail against, open the vise 
wide enough so that the inside of the basket can rest on the outer 
jaw. Or cut a 
stick of wood 
just the length 
to fit snugly be- 
tween two oppo- 
site cruss-cleats, 
and fit it between 
them. Or, some- 
thing heavy like 
a hammer or a flat iron, may be held inside with one hand, while 
the other drives the nail. If the point of the upholstery nail pro- 
jects thru, clinch it; that is, drive it against a piece of iron. Pro-

little feet at the four corners, see Figs. 9 and 49. They may be 
made in this 
way: From a 7%”

of the basket. After staining a portion and before it dries, wipe the 
stain off with cotton waste (obtainable at a paint store) or with an 
old cloth. In this way stain 
and wipe the entire surface. 
Then let the stain thoroly dry, 
24 hours, before waxing with 
“Old Dutch Finish.” If the 
wax is hard, soften it by plac- 
ing the can in hot water. 
Smear it over the surface with 
a brush, and let it dry over 
night. Then rub with a piece 
of soft cloth, cheese cloth, for 
instance. The more rubbing 
the better will be the polish. 
No more wax is needed,   
The principal processes in this 
first project are the sawing and 
planing of a number of cleats. 
Other projects involving the 
same processes are (1) the letter tray shown in Fig. 50. The slats 
on the sides and bottom are rabbeted into the ends and nailed in place 
with brads. (2) The box screen in which a flower-pot may stand,

frames each made of seven slats nailed to four cleats. These are 
tied tight together with a bunch of newspapers between.

  CHAPTER V 
PICTURE-FRAME-CLAMP 
Design. A picture-frame-clamp is of good design when it serves 
its purpose well. As shown in Fig. 53, this clamp meets this re- 
quirement. In Fig. 54, the details of its construction are made 
plain. The two long arms, A,A, by pivoting on a hinge, and by 
means of a series of holes in them, make it possible to adjust the 
clamp to frames varying in proportions and sizes, while the two 
small pieces, C,C, into the 90° angles of which the frame fits, are 
made adjustable by pivoting at these holes. A pair of these clamps 
is necessary for gluing up one frame. When set up as shown in Fig. 
53, the joints of the frame are pulled tight into place by means of a 
handscrew. As here designed, 
this clamp will serve for frames 
from 6”x9”" to 18”x24”. To 
be of use it must be accurate, but a <a 
é = > I 
there is no necessity for mak- a 
ing it over-nice. net ee 
The woods selected are yel- 
low poplar (medium strength — Fig. 55 Method of perpendicular chiseling. 
and easy to work) and maple 
(very strong). But if the clamp is to be used often, maple should 
be used thruout. 
Finish. To prevent the glue in the picture-frame from sticking 
to the clamp, a coat of boiled linseed oil is applied all over the clamp. 
The following materials are required: 
Yellow poplar, or other medium strong wood, 7%”x6%4”x17”, 
Maple or oak, 7%”x1%4"x26", 
8 round-head screws, 1%4” No. 12, 
And a little boiled linseed oil. 
I. Making the arms. First see that your plane is sharp and 
otherwise in good order (See Handwork in Wood, pp. 76 and 58). 
The long pieces (arms) are to be of yellow poplar and each is

%"x 1¥%"x 16” in size. To get them out, first smooth one broad 
surface, if it needs it, then plane one edge of the board straight and 
square. Gage a line 1%” from this edge, rip-saw it off, dress up the 
edge again, and repeat, until you have the four required pieces. 
Plane these pieces to 114” wide. With the back-saw saw off one end 
of each piece square in the mi- 
ter-box. With the dividers, lay 
out a quarter-circle on the broad 
side of the other end of each 
piece, Fig. 55. Next trim off the 
waste by sawing off the corner 
and then by means of “perpen- 
dicular chiseling” (Handwork 
in Wood, pp. 56-58). Or chisel- 
ing alone may be employed. Pro- 
ceed as follows: Lay one of the 
pieces flat on a piece of waste 
wood or a cutting board. Grasp 
the handle of the 1” chisel, in 
the right hand, thumb up, Fig. 
56, (Handwork in Wood, Fig. 
72) and let the blade of the 
chisel pass between the thumb 
and the first finger of the left 
hand, which rests, back down, 
on the work, and holds it in 
place. The right hand pushes 
the chisel downward, and the 
left hand controls its position. 
ti ini Trim off the waste outside the

  If more force is required push with your chest against the end of 
the chisel handle. If still more force is needed, use the mallet in 
your right hand, grasping the blade of the chisel in your left hand 
(Handwork in Wood, Fig. 76). Always work around from the side 
- to the end (Fig. 75, Handwork in Wood) ; otherwise you are likely 
to split the piece. When you have cut nearly to the line, set the 
piece up diagonally in the vise so that the quarter circle is up, and
-P-A-G-E-61
PICTURE-FRAME-CLAMP 61 
pare off shavings with the chisel, flat side down (as in Fig. 74, 
Handwork in Wood). The right hand pushes the chisel forward 
while the left thumb pushes it sidewise, thus giving a diagona 
cut. Trim all the pieces 
in this way. Another 
method of trimming a 
curve is by means of the 
spokeshave. This is in 
reality a plane with a 
short sole, so made in 
order that the cutter 
can follow curves. It is 
held in both hands as 
in Fig. 57, and it may 
be either pushed or 
pulled. Before begin- |. : a Ee 
ning to use it, see that Fig. 87. Using the spokeshave. 
the cutter is sharp and properly set. In the kind recommende 
above (p. 30) the width of the throat may be adjusted by means 
of the thumb-screw. This also alters the depth of the cut. With 
this too] trim 
off the quarter 
circle. By turn- 
ing the blade 
diagonally to the 
direction of the 
cut, it will be 
found to work 
more easily and 
reliably.   
   
      
    
    
Next gage a 
center line from 
end to end on 
both broad sides 
of each piece. 
Then set the di- 
viders at 114” between points and beginning at the square end, step 
off and prick in this center line 7 points, Fig. 58. Repeat this process   
Fig.58. Stepping off distances with the dividers

on the other side and do it on all four pieces. Then set the compass 
at %” between points and starting from each point already pricked, 
prick 7 other points toward the rectangular end. Also make a mark 
on the center line 114” from the other (quadrantal) end. 
Now bore the holes, 
first the 7/16” holes at 
the points first pricked, 
then the 4” holes, at 
the points %4” from 
these. To insert the bit 
in the brace, hold by 
the left hand the sleeve of the chuck, pointing it upward, and revolve 
the handle with the other hand until the jaws open enough to receive 
the tang of the bit entire. Drop in the 7/16” bit, and reverse the 
motion until the bit is firmly gripped (Fig. 186, Handwork in Wood). 
Fasten one of the 16” pieces in the vise (Fig. 137, Handwork in 
Wood) flat side up, taking care to have it parallel with the top of 
the bench in order to help bore straight. Take the brace in the right 
hand and the bit in the left, and insert the point of the bit in the 
prick 114” inch from the end. Now grasp the knob of the brace in 
the hollow of the left hand. Set the try-square upright near the work

and sight from two directions, at right angles to each other, so as to 
see that the bit is perpendicular (Tig. 137, Handwork in Wood). 
Revolve the handle clockwise, bore about half way thru, then bore the 
next hole (114” from the first) and so on, till all the holes in one
-P-A-G-E-63
  PICTURE-FRAME-CLAMP 63 
side are bored. By counting the revolutions while boring, you can 
quickly learn when to stop. Turn the piece over and bore in the cor- 
responding pricks on the other side. Bore the holes in all the pieces. 
Remember that unless the work is accurate, the clamp will be of no 
use as a clamp. ‘Then insert the 14” in the brace and bore the other 
set of holes in the same way. Bore a %4” hole at the mark which is 
1%” from quadrantal end. 
The next step is to cut out the space between each %4” and 4” 
hole, making a buttonhole shaped opening, Fig. 59. Lay one piece 
down flat on the cutting board. Grasp the chisel as for perpendicu- 
lar chiseling (see above), cut out an opening between the two holes, 
which shall be V-shaped in cross-section, but tangent to the outside 
of the small hole; that is, parallel to the sides of the piece. Gradu- 
ally deepen this cut. Turn the piece over and repeat until you can 
cut clear thru it. Cut till the opening is tangent to the outside of 
the 44” hole all the way thru, as in Fig. 59. There are 28 of these 
openings to cut. 
Il. Making the blocks. Next prepare the small pieces of hard 
wood. They are all 7%” thick, 114” wide, so plane them while they . 
are all in one piece. In planing this hard wood, be content with tak- 
ing quite fine shavings. Otherwise your plane is likely to be “choked.” 
But if it does choke, do not try to pick the shavings out of the throat 
with another tool. This is likely to injure the cutter. Rather take 
the cutter out of the plane by first removing the clamp. If the shav- 
ings are wedged between the cutter and the cap, loosen the screw 
which holds them together using the edge of the clamp as a screw- 
driver, and remove the shavings and reset the cap, placing the edge of 
the cap quite close to the edge of the cutter (1/32”). See Fig. 60. 
Re-insert the cutter in the plane, adjust it carefully and proceed. 
When the piece is properly 
planed up, saw it up into the 
right lengths; namely, 6 pieces, 
334” long. 
Set the sliding Tee-bevel at 
45° (see p. 52) and mark 
out 2 internal angles on both Fig. 61, Method of sawing stop blocks of 
ends of 4 of the pieces, as ESERRe Are Rte CBU 
shown in the drawing. Set these diagonally in the vise; trim off 
with the chisel a little of the arris across the thickness, and with the 
back-saw, saw out the angle as accurately as possible, Fig. 61.

If an accurate miter-box is available (like the Stanley or Lang-

a piece of wood 4” wide, and clamp this to the fence of the miter-box 
in such a position that the saw 
will just rest on the end arris

Fig. 62. Saw to the center and 
repeat. 
Smooth up the cuts with a 
sharp chisel, testing them io

the broad side and make a true 
90° angle with each other.

and in the center sidewise, with a No. 5 gimlet-bit (number stamped 
on the tang), bore a hole partly thru, and screw in a round-headed 
screw (134” No. 12) until the head is 7%” from the surface, as shown 
in the drawing. You should be able to button this firmly into one of 
the openings which you have made in the long pieces. 
Next prepare the hinge pieces (76"x14"x334"). Bore a hole ~ 
(with No. 5 gimlet-bit) 34” from each end, part way thru. Slip a 
round-head screw (114” No. 12) thru the hole at the quadrantal end 
of one of the long pieces and screw it into the hole just made in the 
hinge piece. The hinge piece should be screwed firmly down to the 
long piece but the joint should turn easily. 
Insert screws in all 4 of these holes, making two hinged parts. 
Now oil all the parts with a coat of boiled linseed oil and wipe off 
with cotton waste. 
Other projects involving the boring of holes are shown in Fig. 63.

Cuapter VI 
THE MITERED PICTURE-FRAMK 
I. THE FRAMING OF PICTURES 
The first thing to do in making a picture-frame is to select the 
picture, because such details as the use of a mat, the size, proportion, 
tone, and decoration of the frame, all depend upon the character of 
the picture. Furthermore, the picture should be one well worth 
framing. To select a picture that is not beautiful, is but to honor 
what should be ignored. 
To be able to frame good pictures well, then, is the ideal to be 
kept in mind in learning to make picture-frames. 
The suggestions here given are intended to apply only to the 
selection and the framing of comparatively small pictures, such as 
photographic and chromolithographic reproductions and Japanese 
color prints. In these days of cheap reproduction, good pictures of 
this class are inexpensive and readily secured. In the periodicals 
are to be found excellent reproductions of the work of some of the 
greatest living artists, such as Maxfield Parrish, Jules Guerin, John 
W. Alexander, Edwin Abbey, Frank Brangwyn, Gari Melcher, Pamela 
Colman Smith, and Jessie Wilcox Smith, to mention a few. Also 
Japanese color prints as well as photographic reproductions of univers- 
ally recognized European and American masters may be procured at 
the best art stores. 
For the novice, a sufficiently safe guide to the chotce of good pic- 
tures, is to select from the works of these artists. However, a study 
of Prof. Arthur W. Dow’s “Composition,” would go a long way 
toward enabling the student to select wisely his own pictures for 
framing. 
When it is remembered that the frame is made for the picture 
and not the picture for the frame, then it follows that the frame is 
to be so designed as to set off the picture to the best advantage. 
As to the adaptation of the frame to the picture, in the first 
place, the mat may properly be considered as a part of the frame. It, 
65  
-P-A-G-E-66
    66 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
like the frame, is a device to give a setting to the picture. Whether 
or not a mat is to be included in the framing of the picture, depends 
somewhat on the location of the picture in the room, as well as the 
idea one has in 
mind in fram- 
ing the picture, 
and the charac- 
ter of the pic- 
ture. 
In favor of 
the mat, it is to 
be remembered 
that an ordi- 
  Fig. 64. The mat makes possible the introduction of interest- nary mitered 
ing proportions in the framing. _ 
frame by itself 
involves the necessity of having all the margins around the picture 
equal in width; whereas, by the use of a mat, this monotony can be 
avoided and a subtle and pleasing variety produced, as in Fig. 64. 
As to the size of the mat: If there is to be a mat it should be 
large enough to be effective. A mat that is only 
a little larger than a picture looks as tho it were 
a mere device for splicing out the picture to fit 
the frame. On the other hand the picture should ae 
not look lost in the mat. 
As to the width of the margins of the mat: Tt en 
one consideration to be borne in mind is the 
shape of the entire frame resulting from the in- | 
troduction of a mat. As a general rule it is safe Wake 
to say that the margins should not be such as to 
produce a square frame for an oblong picture ———— 
See Fig. 65. A little observation will show that arraszementofepaces is good because it con- 
squareness in either picture or frame is com- forms to the propor- tions of the picture. 
monly avoided by artists. An oblong is less The lower one is not : good because the 
monotonous and hence more pleasing than a square frame is out of : : harmony with the square, just as an ellipse or other varied curve long picture. 
is more pleasing than a circle. As to the proportions of the oblong, 
simple multiples are to be avoided; that is, the ratio of the short side 
to the long side should be not simply 1 to 2 or 2 to 3, but a more 
subtle relation.
-P-A-G-E-67
THE MITERED PICTURE-FRAME 67 
If the margins around a picture are widened uniformly on all 
sides, what was originally a pleasing rectangle will lose its good 
proportions, but they may be kept good by increasing the length of 
the mat more than its width, Fig. 65. It is a pat Hse Sane 
safe rule for the amateur never to place a picture fH | ~ 
elsewhere than in the vertical center of the-mat,— [| Ei 
nor to place a horizontal picture in a vertical

frame, the same tones and values that predominate in the picture 
may be repeated in the frame; for instance, for Maxfield Parish’s

: = : 67. The frame 
is finished in 
yellows match-

the harmony de- 
sired may be se- 
cured by the in- 
troduction of a 
strong contrast, 
as a blue mat for 
a picture pre- 
dominating in 
orange. Or, for 
a contrast in 
values, for in-

As to the width of a frame, it is difficult to make any rules that 
will definitely and easily solve all cases, but a few suggestions may be
-P-A-G-E-68
68 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WooD 
found serviceable_ The width of a frame and its value bear a close 
relation, in their effect on a picture, as follows: 
A wide frame finished dark is appropriate for a picture predomi- 
nating in darks and massive in treatment, as in Fig. 68. 
Or a wide frame finished light (Fig. 69) sets off well a picture 
light in value and broad in treatment, and go on, thru all the inter- 
mediate grades from very dark to very light. 
A narrow frame finished very dark, looks well around a picture 
where darks are used sparingly and delicately, as in some Japanese 
prints, See Figs. 70, 
71, 72. 
So, in like manner, a 
narrow and very light 
frame would be used 
only for a picture in a 
very light key and of a 
very delicate treatment, 
as in Fig. 73, 1 and 3. 
Where a mat is part 
of the framing of a pic- 
ture, the frame and mat 
may vary in tone and 
value, in sucha way as 
will not only not inter- 
fere with the unity of 
the picture, but will 
still further enhance its

the picture and its frame by repeating in the frame some character- 
istic feature of the picture. If severe straight lines and flat spaces 
predominate, these are easily reproduced in the plain unbroken sur- 
face of the frame. Sometimes the representation of carving in the 
picture can be repeated in the frame, or a certain treatment or pat- 
tern in the picture may be echoed by a suitable treatment of the 
frame. Often an appropriate beading or other molding may give 
the desired effect, see Fig. 74. Sometimes a touch of bright color, 
as that of the pirate’s cap in Fig. 75, can be repe ted with gond ef-

fect in a fine line in the frame. In a word, the frame must be con- 
sistent with the color, notan, and general character of the picture. 
In selecting the wood for a picture frame, it is well for a beginner 
to choose some soft wood like white pine or yellow poplar, until he 
is used to working the necessary tools and can make the joints well. 
These woods can be stained in a great variety of ways. Later it is 
better to make frames of hard wood. Oak is the most common. 
Maple is good 
for a “silver 
gray” effect to 
be obtained by 
staining with 
the water stain 
of that name. 
Mahogany is ex- 
cellent where the 
color can be 
made to har- 
monize. Care 
must be taken 
not to select 
woods having 
such a_ promi- 
nent “grain” as 
to divert atten- 
tion from the 
picture itself. 
Concerning the 
materials to be Fig 69. Broad frame (pine), stained gray, oiled and rubbed used for mats, with aluminum dust. Maxfield Parrish’s “Prince Agib.”     “cover paper” is one of the most suitable. Ash gray will be found to 
tone well with a great variety of prints. Dull toned wall paper which 
has no pattern is often good. Grass-cloth comes in various colors, 
and this or raw silk stretched on cardboard makes a very effective 
setting especially for some Japanese prints. 
Mounting the picture on the mat may be done in one of two 
ways: (1) The picture may be pasted directly on the mat. In most 
cases it will be found sufficient to fasten it in place by means of a

the top margin of the back of 
the picture. Before pasting the 
picture on the mat, locate it 
carefully and mark its location 
with fine pencil dots at the two 
upper corners. If the picture 
is to be mounted on the mat 
with paste all over the back, 
the mat must be of stiff enough 
material to hold its shape. If 
this method is used, the picture 
should first be dipped in water, 
the surface moisture dried off, 
paste applied uniformly over 
the back, the picture carefully 
laid in place and pressed un- 
der weight.

Il. The Framing of a Jap- 
anese Print. The picture chosen 
to be framed, according to the 
following directions, is a Jap- 
anese print, Fig. 76. The frame 
is to be perfectly plain. The 
size of the picture is 914”x13%”. 
The frame is to be 1” wide and 
34” thick. The materials re- 
quired are as follows: 
“White pine, 74”x1"’x4’o.” 
Picture backing, the same size as 
the picture, or mat, if the picture 
is to be mounted. The backing

THE MITERED PICTURE-FRAME 71 
Plane up the strips in two pieces, each long enough to make one 
long side and one short side of the frame. To determine the length 
of the members of 
a frame, add to 
the length of each 
dimension of the 
picture twice the 
width of the 
frame. In this 
case there will be 
needed two pieces 
about two feet 
long; thus, 914”

that they will be 1” wide and 34” thick. 
Test the straightness by sighting along 
the length, as in Handwork in Wood, Fig. 107. Be sure that the 
thickness and width of both pieces is uniform thruout. Unless the 
members are accurate the frame will not come together right. The 
next step is to 
plow out a rab- 
bet (or rebate) 
along one artis 
of each piece, to 
receive the glass 
and the picture 
and the back- 
ing. This should 
be done with 
the rabbet-plane 
(See Huandwork 
in Wood, p. 79).

  2) DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
To use the rab- 
bet-plane on a 
narrow piece of 
wood, it is first 
necessary to 
make a device 
like that shown 
in Fig. 77. On 
a piece X, say 
2” or 8” wide 
and slightly 
longer than the 
long members 
of the frame, 
nail a_ strip 
about 1%” wide, 
5%” from one 
edge. Into the 
internal angle

pieces and near

small nail or 
screw (A in Fig. 77) so that its head 
will project about 4”. This device when 
used is to be fastened on the bench be- 
tween a bench-stop and the tail-vise-dog. 
Set the rabbet-plane so that the fence al- 
lows but ™%” of the cutter to cut, and 
set the depth gage so that the plane can 
cut 3%” deep. The cutter should be ad- 
justed so as to cut as in an ordinary 
plane. Along the right arris of the sole 
is a removeable spur which scores the 
wood so that the cutter will not tear out 
but cut out the shavings clean. Before 
beginning to plane see that this spur is 
sharp and that the right corner of the 
cutter is in line with the arris of the 
sole. Now cut a trial rabbet on a waste 
    Fig. 76. Black frame

  THE MITERED PICTURE-FRAME 73 
piece of wood, which has a straight edge. At the first stroke the spur 
will mark the width of the rabbet. Be careful to hold the plane flat, 
tilting it neith- 
er to the right 
nor to the left. 
The beginner in 
his effert to 
keep the fence 
close up to the 
edge is apt to 
tilt the plane to 
the right. This 
makes the spur 
cut in obliquely, 
as in Fig. 114, 
Handwork in 
Wood. 
If the plane 
is not running Fig. 77. Device for holding strips when rabbeting. 
  true, stop planing and with a chisel trim out the recess clean and 
square and then proceed with the plane to the proper depth. After 
sufficient practice on waste pieces, plow the rab- 
bets on the members of the frame, as in Fig. 78. 
Cut the 24” piece of stock in two, so as to make 
one long and one short member of the picture- 
frame. Fasten the device already made between 
a bench-stop and the dog in the tail-vise. Lay 
one member of the frame, narrow edge up, in 
Fig.78 Endviewot this device, abutting against the nail. Plow out 
rabpetedistsip: the rabbets in all four members. The next 
step is to cut the pieces to their proper lengths with a miter at each 
end. Fig. 79 shows the shape. The picture and glass are 914” x 
1314”; the frame is an inch wide and the rabbet 3¢” wide. Hence the 
    Fig. 79. Rabbeted and mitered member of picture-frame. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
finished outside length of each member of the frame will be 54”-+5%” 
or 114” greater than the length (and width) of the picture and of the 
glass. Then allow 1%” for play and the outside lengths of the long 
members of the frame will be 147%” (13%” + 14%” + 1%”) and 
the outside length of the short members 1076” (914" + 114” + \%"). 
Place one member face up in the miter box, that is, so that the 
rabbet is down and front, as in Fig. 80. With the back-saw cut off one 
end at an angle of 45 degrees, taking care that the side which is to 
be the outside of the frame is the longer, as in Fig. 79. Do this to 
one end of all the pieces. Now cut the other end of one piece in the 
same way, except that the saw is 
laid in the other 45° kerf of the 
miter-box. Cut the other member 
of equal length, using the first 
member as a measure, and repeat 
with the second pair. Now test 
these angles with the try-square 
from what will be the face side of 
the member when in the finished 
frame, and again test with the 
bevel set at 45 degrees from what

milter box (See above, page 52.) If ne- 
cessary trim on the bench-hook with the chisel (as above, page 52), 
or fasten the piece in the vise at an angle of 45 degrees and carefully 
plane toward the acute angle. This acute angle may be supported hy 
a piece, X, also fastened in the vise, as in Fig. 81. Be sure the oppo- 
site members have equal lengths. 
Now set up the picture-frame clamp (Fig. 53), adjusting the small 
parts to their proper holes, put the members in place, face up, and 
clamp the whole together in a handscrew. If any corners do not make 
a close joint, either the angles are not square or the opposite mem- 
bers are of unequal lengths. Make them right before you proceed. 
When everything is ready, take the frame apart, put a little glue 
(see Handwork in Wood, p. 128) on all surfaces that are to join, and 
reclamp. Test the corners with a try-square, and if they are not right 
angles, adjust the handscrew by sliding one jaw sideways, one way 
or tbe other, until the angles come up right. Be sure that the faces 
are flush. Leave the frame in the vise for 6 hours to dry. When

THE MITERED PIOTURE-FRAME 75 
the frame is taken out of the vise it should be handled carefully, for 
the joints still need to be reinforced. A common way to do this is 
with brads. If brads are used it 
is a safe precaution to make a 
hole before gluing with a brad- 
awl thru one piece. Fasten the 
frame in the bench vise, so as to 
grip only one member at a time, 
and that vertically. Bore the 
hole and drive in the brad with 
great care. 
A better reinforcement is by 
means of a spline or slip-feather 
(see Handwork in Wood, Fig. 
268, No. 55). A convenient 
way to insert these is as follows: 
Get, if possible, some maple ve- ° Seg Holding member of ploture Frame

a knife into 8 pieces about 34”x 2”. Fasten the frame in the vise 
diagonally, so that one corner will project, and with the back saw cut 
two saw-kerfs, A and B, as in 
Fig. 82 and Fig. 83. The pieces 
of veneer should fit snugly into 
these kerfs. If the veneer is too 
thick, scrape or sandpaper it un- 
til it slips into the kerfs. If the 
veneer is too thin, use two pieces 
with glue between them for each 
kerf, thinning them if necessary. 
Put glue on both sides of 
each piece of veneer, slip it into 
place and set the frame away to 
dry. When dry, cut off the 
superfluous veneer with a chisel 
or knife. With the plane, set

eave no glue showing. 
    
      
 
-P-A-G-E-76
    
76 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
The next step is to stain the frame. As this frame is to be black, 
a simple method of staining it is to dissolve a little nigrosine in alco- 
hol, and apply with a brush. Directions for a more penetrating black 
stain are to be found in Handwork in Wood, p. 211. 
A good finish for picture-frames, which are handled but little, is 
wax. Apply as before directed. (See Handwork in Wood, p. 214). 
Next cut the picture backing, so that the grain will run the short 
way of the picture. It can be cut 
conveniently with a sharp knife 
and a straight edge. If neces- 
sary, cut on both sides and then 
break. Cut enough, and in as 
large pieces as possible, so as to 
cover the entire surface of the 
picture and mat as they lie in 
the frame. Next cut the glass to 
fit the frame, in this case 914”x 
13%”. A glass cutter with 
hardened steel revolving dise can 
be bought for 10 cents. It is 
well to practice on a piece of 
waste glass. To cut the glass, 
proceed as follows: Make marks 
Fig. 83. Kerfs cut in corner of picture- on the glass near the edges at the frame to receive slip feathers. proper length. Lay a. straight- 
edge of wood one-eighth of an inch to the left of these marks (to al- 
low for the distance of the cutting disc from the face of the giass 
cutter). Hold the glass cutter perpendicular, and with one firm 
stroke scratch the glass from edge to edge, Fig. 84. Be sure that 
the extreme edges are scratched. Then holding up the glass in the 
left hand, tap the underside of the glass near the near edge with the 
glass cutter, until the edge just cracks, Fig. 85. Now take hold of 
the portion of the glass to the right of the scratch between the thumb 
and first finger of the right hand, and with a slight pressure the glass 
will break clean along the line of the scratch, Fig. 86. If the scratch 
is so near the right edge that there is not room to hold it so, as de- 
scribed above, with a pair of pliers, carefully snap off the waste a 
little at a time, Fig. 87. Mark and cut the width in the same way. 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  THE MITERED PICTURE-FRAME 17 
Then wash the glass. An easy way to do this is with Bon Ami 
soap, rubbed on with a damp cloth, allowed to dry and polished off. 
Now lay the frame, face down, on the bench. Place the glass in posi- 
tion, the picture on top of it, and the picture back on top of that, 
fitting the pieces of it in place. Now nail all down in place, using 
   
       Fig. 84. Cutting glass. (Step 1.) Fig. 85. Tapping under the scratch 
in the glass to start acrack. (Step 2.) 
7%" brads, No. 18 as follows: Lay a brad flat down on the backing, 
point to the frame. Press it down with one finger, and tap the head 
with the hammer sliding on the backing. It will facilitate matters 
to let the frame rest against a bench-stop or a weight. 
The next step is to paste a piece of Manilla paper over the back 
of the frame to keep out dust. Spread a thin film of liquid glue over 
the back of the frame, near the outer edge. Dampen one side of the 
Manilla paper with a wet cloth passed over it. Lay the dry side down

on the back of the frame, as flat as possible. When it dries it will 
be stretched taut and the superfluous paper can be trimmed off with 
a sharp knife. 
Next locate the screw-eyes in the back of the frame, say 2” from 
the top. Start a hole with a brad awl, and screw home the screw-

eyes, (Brooks No. 21434”.) Stretch a flexible wire straight between 
the screw-eyes, twisting it back around itself, and the frame is done. 
III. Additional Suggestions for Frames. The frame just de- 
scribed is the plainest and simplest one possible. With but little dif- 
ficulty, however, before cutting the miters, it may be considerably

embellished. For examples see Fig. 88. Chamfers can be planed on 
the front arrises of the members of the frame, as at a, or the front 
surface may be rounded, as at 6. Instead of making the frame flat, 
it can be bevelled in or out, as at ¢c and d. This should be done with 
the plane after the rabbet is plowed. A thin line may be grooved near 
the inner edge so as to make it, in cross-section like e. This is done 
by means of a veining tool after the frame is joined together. Draw 
the line to be grooved carefully with a pencil. Lay a straight edge 
along this line and with the veining tool running along the straight 
edge, cut out the groove. Take care to keep the depth as even as 
possible. See Fig. 176, p. 130. 
A considerable variety of beads and flutings may be made by 
means of the Universal Hand Beader, (Stanley’s No. 66) a tool which 
costs about Y5c. See Fig. 89. 
More complicated moldings, such as that shown in Fig. 90 may be 
made with a cabinet scraper, filed to the desired shape, and clamped 
between a pair of blocks of wood by means of screws as shown in 
Fig. 91. The two edges A and B 
serve as guides sliding along 
both edges of the molding. 
A nosing may be added to the 
outside of a molding, as in Fig. 
88, f, as follows: Fig. 89, Hand beader with cutters. 
Prepare thin strips of wood, say 4%” thick and 4%” wider than 
the frame is thick. Round off one edge as follows:—Fasten the jack 
plane upside down in the vise, hold the strip at an angle and pull it 
over the plane cutter so as to plane off an arris, Fig. 92. Do this for 
both the arrises on one narrow edge. Finish it round with sand-

paper. Or better, round this with the hand beader, Fig. 89, or the 
cornering tool (Handwork in Wood, Fig. 124.) Drive thru these 
strips several little brads, so that the points project slightly and fit 
them exactly in place on the outside of the members of the frame. 
Prepare several handscrews so as to clamp these strips to the mem-

bers, taking care to protect the inner edges of the members by waste 
strips of wood, Fig. 93. When all is ready glue the strips in place, 
clamping them firmly with the handscrews. The brads will keep 
them from slipping out of place. Wipe off superfluous glue carefully 
with a rag moistened with very hot water. When dry, remove the 
handscrews and pull out the brads. The brad holes can be closed up 
by wetting them and placing a hot iron on them. This, by the way, 
is a good method of closing up all surface bruises where the fibers 
themselves are not broken. Finally cut the miters and proceed as 
before. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
    
80 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
A frame can be made to look lighter by plowing out a narrow rab-

best be done before the miters are cut, but it may be done after as-

THE CANDLESTICK 
Altho the essential features of this project set fixed limitations to 
its design, yet a great variety of forms and embellishments are pos- 
sible; see Fig. 95. The success of the design depends, primarily, on 
the harmonious unity of the parts. If the design be good, the piece 
is worth much painstaking labor. 
This project consists of two parts, the copper socket and pan, and 
the wooden base supporting these. 
I. The essential features to be fixed are: 
1. The size of the candle to be used. (Common sizes are 4” 
or 11%”.) This determines the diameter of the socket. 
2. The pan, of such a shape as to catch the drip well. This is 
to be soldered to the socket. 
3. A base, large enough to be stable. The construction sug- 
gested for this base is a cross-lap joint. 
4. A convenient means of handling. This may be either a loop 
for the forefinger, Fig. 96, or a column to be grasped, Fig. 97. 
5. The kind of wood. The piece does not require much ma- 
terial and is worth while making in wood of a good species and qual- 
ity. Mahogany, black walnut, and sweet gum are not difficult to 
work, can be finished handsomely and their colors harmonize well 
with the copper parts. 
II. The refinement of the proportions. The candlestick without 
the column may well be quite small, each member of the joint being 
not more than 4” or 5” long and 114” or more wide. 
With a column, Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, Fig. 97, the size of the base will 
naturally increase; the higher the column, the broader the base. The 
candlestick must seem as well as be stable. 
If feet are added, Nos. 2, 7, Fig. 97, the effect of stability will 
be increased. 
III. Embellishments. These include modifications in outlines by 
modeling, Fig. 97%, No. 5, chamfering, Fig. 97, No. 8, coving Fig. 98,

is done, the treatment should be harmonious thruout.

An appearance of lightness may be given to the column by con- 
structing it as in Fig. 99. 
The best finish for a candlestick that may be frequently handled 
and is liable to be smeared with wax or tallow, is boiled linseed oil, 
thoroly rubbed. If made of mahogany, the color may be darkened 
with bichromate of potash. See below, p. 92.

IV. Directions for making cross-lap joint. In order not to waste 
good wood in learning how to make the cross-lap joint, it is well to 
make first a practice joint of pine or other soft wood. 
Select a piece of straight grained pine, and carefully plane it to 
the size, 34”x154"x11”", finishing all surfaces.. For the order of plan-

ing surfaces, (see Handwork in Wood, page 72.) Be careful that the 
piece is of uniform width and thickness thruout, and finish both ends 
clean and square. Mark a point 5” from each end of the piece, score 
with a sharp knife all around the piece at both these points, cut a 
little groove on the waste side of the lines, on one broad surface, (see 
Handwork in Wood, page 66, and Fig. 91), saw off the waste and 
trim the ends with the block-plane. Now make the half-lap joint as 
described in Handwork in Wood, page 155.

get a surface parallel to the de-

When these two sides are cor- 
rectly tapered, lay out the other 
two sides in a similar way, draw- 
ing lines at L J and M K, Fig. 
102, and plane to shape. If for 
lack of a tail-vise, it is necessary Plane off from what is to

to hold this piece, already tapered on two sides, sidewise in the vise, 
two blocks of soft wood need to be made first, having a similar taper, 
and between these the column can be held without injury in the vise 
as in Fig. 103. These blocks will also be useful 
in holding the column while adding chamfers or 
other embellishments. 
The column is now to be jointed to the ped- 
estal. The simplest way to do this is with a butt 
dowel joint. Bore with a number 40 twist drill

clamp the base tightly to the col- 
umn with a handscrew. When 
dry, remove the handscrew, 
gently pull out one brad, bore

screws (114”, No. 4). See Handwork in Wood, p. 126. If the socket 
and pan are to be made as in Fig. 113, the capital should have in it a 
hole into which the socket may 
fit. For a 34” candlestick, this 
hole should be 7%” in diameter. 
Take for the capital a piece of 
wood several inches long. The 
extra length makes it easier to 
plane, and lessens the danger of 
splitting when the hole is bored.

proper width and thickness and bore a 7%” hole into it, gripping it 
sidewise in the vise. This also is to prevent splitting it. If the piece 
is 74” thick the hole should be about 5” deep, bored with a Foerstner 
bit. Next saw off to the proper 
length and finish the ends of 
the piece neatly with the block- 
plane. It may be glued and 
screwed securely to the column, 
driving the screws thru what 
wood is left at the bottom of 
the hole.

of wood to the desired thick- 
ness; in this case 34” thick, 2” 
wide and 8%” long, and if the 
arrises are chamfered or other- 
wise shaped, this should also be 
done before cutting up into 
small pieces. After cutting up, 
finish what are to be the outside 
ends of each piece harmoniously 
with their sides. That is, have 
the shape continuous around

Put a little glue in the middle of the upper surface of each foot, ad- 
just and press it to its proper place, and drive the brads home. The 
piece is now ready to be cleaned up and finished. After carefully 
sandpapering, wet the surface with water in order to “raise the grain,” 
and when dry sandpaper once 
more. Then when the water stain 
is applied, the grain will not 
rise again. 
If the piece is made of ma- 
hogany, it may be darkened with 
a solution of bichromate of 
potash crystals, to be obtained at 
any druggist’s. Make a satu-

V. The Metalwork. For the socket and pan 
for the candlestick, sheet copper, gage No. 20, is 
needed. To get the proper size for the socket or 
cylinder, wrap a piece of paper around the candle 
to get its circumference, and add to this four 
times the thickness of the copper. With the | Fie AP sid sont

this is as follows: Touch the 
joint thruout its length with a 
little stick dipped in soldering 
fluid. (This may be bought 
prepared at a hardware store, 
either in fluid form, or as solder- 
ing salt, (Yager’s) to be dissolved in water according to the direc-

On the joint lay a small piece, say 14”, of wire solder. By means 
of a pair of pliers, hold the cylinder, joint down, over the gas flame 
of a bunsen burner or gas stove, till the solder melts. With a small 
stick wipe the solder back and forth in the joint and set aside to cool. 
To make the pan proceed as follows: With the snips cut out a 
square of copper, 15%” square, 
snip off the sharp corners, and 
file the edges square and 
smooth. See Fig. 111. Use 
fine sandpaper or emery cloth 
to polish up the surface. Turn 
up the edges slightly all around 
as follows: Set a bar of iron, 
say 4” thick and 34” wide, up-

end so that it will be slightly 
rounded and smooth, and with the horn hammer, hammer the edges 
over this “stake”, as it is called. See Fig. 111 for the cross-section 
of the pan. Be particularly careful to make the corners all alike, and 
to keep the bottom of the pan flat. If it becomes concave turn it 
upside down on a flat surface and tap the bottom gently with the 
horn hammer. 
With a twist-drill, held in a hand-drill, (see Handwork in Wood, 
p. 106, Fig. 187,) bore and countersink two small holes in the 
bottom of the pan to fit 34” No. 2 screws, as in Fig. 111. These 
holes should be inside a circle 34” in diameter at 
the center of the pan, so as to be included in en

TABORET 
In order to keep the construction of this project as simple as pos- 
sible, the limitations imposed are that the frame shall consist of two 
cross-lap joints made of boards under one inch thickness, to which 
are butted and doweled the legs, 
having approximately the same 
thickness. To this frame is at- 
tached a board top. 
Even- under these limita- 
tions, great variety is possible, 
as shown in the accompanying 
photographs. The size may vary 
from a tea or smoking table, Fig. 
121 or 123, to a low stand, a few 
inches in height, Fig. 122. 
The wood suggested is chest- 
nut or cypress, because of their 
easy working qualities, but soft 
mahogany or baywood may be 
used with great success. 
The refinement of propor- 
tions includes the consideration 
of such items as the width and 
thickness of the legs in propor- 
tion to their height, the dispo- 
sition of the stretchers, whether | oi 
they shall be on edge or flat, ig..122:; Low, taboret. 
and where located, the amount of projection of the top beyond the 
legs and the shape of the legs and of the top. 
The attractiveness of the project depends largely upon its good 
proportions and upon the beauty of the grain of the wood. The 
rounding of the dowels into projecting buttons, plainly indicating

the structure, the use of 
chamfers, or coves, and 
the addition of feet, as in 
Figs. 121 and 123 are 
suggested. The color 
depends largely upon 
its intended environment. 
Chestnut turns to a 
beautiful brown when it 
is exposed to ammonia 
fumes and then oiled. 
Since a taboret is to 
be used to hold a potted 
plant, the finish should 
be such as will stand 
moisture best. That is 
boiled linseed oil. 
      The process of mak- 
ing the typical form, 
Fig. 124, will be described first, and the changes later. The drawing 
with dimensions is shown in Fig. 125. Either chestnut or cypress is

good for this project. Chestnut has rather a coarse texture, and is 
liable to split along the annual rings on account of the presence of 
many pores. Cypress is likely to contain many fine checks, produced 
in seasoning. 
Choose if possible wood with a pleasing grain, especially for the top. 
The materials necessary are as follows: 
A. 4 pieces 34”x274"x17”. 
B. 2 pieces 34”x2”x8%4”. 
C. 2 pieces 34”x2%4"x8%”". 
D. 1 piece 34”x13"’x13”. This may be made of two pieces jointed 
together, as shown later. 
16 dowel-pins 5 /16”x 134”. 
4 brass mending straps 1%4”x2’, No. 60. 
12 screws ¥%” No. 4. 
16 brads No. 13, 2%”, No. 12. 
Plane up four pieces, A, to proper size. In order to true the ends 
exactly, all four pieces may be clamped together in a handscrew and 
the bench vise, and block-planed at one time. First plane one set of 
ends, then reverse and plane the other set. Great pains must be 
aken to keep the whole block square, or 
all the pieces will not be of the same 
ength. 
Plane up the stretchers, B and C, in 
a similar way, all four to exactly the same 
ength. Make a cross-lap joint with 
ieces B and with pieces C according to 
directions given in Handwork in Wood, 
p. 155. 
The difference between the joints in 
rieces B and pieces C is that in B the

powenetretchet wittt leg: With this difference however the process 
of making is the same, the flat joint being slightly more difficult. 
Glue these joints together and leave in a handscrew to set, testing 
the joint to see that it is a perfect right angle. 
To fit the lower stretchers to the legs proceed thus: All around 
the legs, 374” from the bottom of each, draw a fine pencil line, and 
on the inside of the legs, at 3/16” from the edges, mark points as in 
Fig. 126. On this line on the outside of all the legs place a mark

34” from each edge to indicate the centers of the holes for the dowel- 
pins, with which the joints are to be fastened together. See Fig. 126. 
Mark center line on the edges of stretch- 
ers C at the ends, as at A B, Fig. 127. 
To fit the upper stretchers B to the 
legs, proceed as follows: Draw a fine pen- 
cil line across the center of the top ends 
of the legs and continue this line down 
both outside and inside of the legs for 
21%” from the top, as in C D £, Fig. 128. 
On this line on the outside of the leg in- 
dicate points A B, %4” and 114” from the 
top for centers of holes for the dowel-pins. 
Mark center lines on the edges of the 
stretchers B at the ends, C D, as in 
  Fig, 127 Center lines AB and 
Fig. 127. CD marked on stretchers. 
If the legs are to be shaped, as in Fig. 129 the following method 
may be used: 
Clamp two legs side by side and bore a 54” hole at the proper 
point A, in Fig. 130, setting the spur of the bit directly in the crack 
between the two legs. Bore half-way 
through, reverse, and finish boring. Re- 
peat on all the edges. The surplus wood 
may then be worked out with a saw and 
spokeshave or small plane. 
Next prepare 16 dowel-pins, each 
134” long and 5/16” diameter. When 
there are a number of pins to cut off, it 
saves time to use a miter-box, fastening a 
stop at the proper distance, (134” in this 
case) from the kerf, and so being able to 
cut each one off without stopping to 
measure, Fig. 131.

driving them with a mallet, not a hammer, thru the 5/16” hole in the

used (2%4”, No.

thru all the legs 
at the points in- 
dicated for the 
dowel-pins, four 
in each leg. Take 
especial pains to 
bore at right 
angles to the 
surface, because 
these holes will 
afterward deter- 
mine the direc- 
tion of the holes for the dowels. Drive the brads (21%4”, No. 12) into 
these holes so that their points just come thru. Start the brads 
(2%4”, No. 12) into these holes, and placing each leg at its proper 
place on each stretcher, drive the nails into the stretchers about 14” 
and take apart. The dents thus made by the nails in the ends of the 
stretchers will make it easy to locate them in place when gluing up.

Have ready two carpenter’s bar clamps, (Handwork in Wood, 
p. 103), two large (Aldrich’s No. 5, 18”): handscrews (Handwork in 
Wood, p. 101), and eight blocks of soft wood, three or four inches 
long and just large enough to fit between each 
pair of nails. 
If no clamps or handscrews are available, sub- 
stitutes may be made thus: Cut two boards ‘and 
two wedges, as in Fig. 134. These improvised 
clamps can be hooked over the blocks which are 
placed between the nails, and then the wedges 
driven in to draw the joints up tight. 
Put a little hot glue on the end of a stretcher, 
B, locate it by means of the marks already made 
in it by the nails in the leg, and drive in the nails, 
leaving the head of the brad projecting half an 
inch, so that it can be easily withdrawn later. In 
the same way nail stretcher C in place to the same 
leg. Then nail the opposite leg to the other ends 
of these two stretchers. Proceed in the same way 
with the other two legs, working as speedily as 
accuracy will permit in order that the glue may

Fold a piece of sandpaper, sand side in, 
hold it near a dowel as a buffer, and with 
a chisel, bevel side down, resting on this 
sandpaper, slice off the arris of the pro- 
jecting dowel as in Fig. 140. When the 
arrises are neatly trimmed, sandpaper the 
end of the dowel into a button shape, hold- 
ing the sandpaper over the thumb. Finish 
the remaining dowels in the same manner. 
Fig. 136. Method of squaring up Instead of shaping the protruding dowel 
eae pins into buttons, an easier way to finish is 
to drive the pins flush with the face of the legs, smooth off the sur- 
face, and drive upholstery nails, Fig. 141, of the appropriate color 
into the surface of each dowel. The taboret 
shown in Fig. 142 is finished in this way. 
If the processes so far have been neatly done, 
there should be very little superfluous glue to 
clean. up. If there is any, clean it off with a 
chisel and scraper. ‘This process may sometimes 
be facilitated by dampening the glue with a little 
hot water on cotton waste. Use as much heat 
and as little water as possible. 
If any bruises appear on the surface in which 
the fibers of the wood are crushed but not cut,

the brass plates with which 
the top is to be fastened to the

An agreeable modification of the de- 
sign described above is to set the lower 
stretchers edgewise, not flat, omit the up- 
per ones, and fasten the upper ends of 
the legs directly to the top, into which 
they are notched, as in Fig. 145. 
In this case the lower stretchers are 
located in the legs by perpendicular cen- 
ter lines on the legs, as in Fig. 146. For 
fastening the legs to the top after it is 
glued up and dressed to size, if the legs 
are to be perpendicular, not slanting, lay 
out on the top the notches for the legs so 
that the distance from opposite ones shall

also Fig. 147. Lay out on both sides of the piece in order to insure 
accuracy in chiseling later. 
  If the top is to be circular, 
lay out the notches first. Then

order prevents the sides of the 
notches from splitting off in

MALLET 
The excellence of design in a mallet depends primarily upon its 
utility. The “fixing of essentials’ is paramount in importance. 
Whatever grace of form or refinement of proportions it may have are 
the result of adaptation to use. In an object of such hard usage, dec-

oration too must play a minor part. As to essentials, a mallet must 
be of proper weight, must “hang” well in the hand; the head must 
be of the hardest wood available, that will not easily split, as maple; 
the handle must be of a tough elastic wood, as hickory, and its form   115

should be oval, so that the worker can feel, without seeing, that the 
face of the head will strike square. The handle should be joined 
firmly to the head, as with

it. A coating of shellac helps

maple is less likely to split with the annual rings than across them. 
(See Wood and Forest, p. 53.) Therefore plan to make the hole for 
the handle as nearly as possible along the annual rings, as in Fig. 155. 
To determine the location 
of the handle hole, mark with 
the marking-gage the center 
point on the cross lines already 
©O drawn, on two opposite sides. 
Fasten the block, thus marked, 
firmly in the bench vise, as in 
Fig. 156. Put a 34” auger-bit 
in the ratchet-brace, hold the 
knob of the brace in the hol- 
low of the left hand and hold 
the body firmly against it so 
that it will change position as 
little as possible; with the try- 
square, see that the bit enters 
the wood at right angles, both horizontally and perpendicularly, and 
when the hole is once started, use only a down stroke with the ratchet 
brace. The brace is thus held steadier and works easier than when 
it is swept round and round. If two persons can work together at 
this process, one can test the bit with the try-square, while the other 
bores. Bore half-way thru and repeat from the opposite side. 
With reasonable care, the holes should meet exactly. If they do 
not, chisel off the projecting 
shoulders inside the hole with 
an inside bevel gouge (34”). 
In order that the handle 
may be firmly held in the head

scribed below, it is necessary to

Next lay out, according to the dimensions given in Fig. 154, the

can be obtained by making a templet of cardboard or thin wood, thus: 
The curve is the

TRAYS 
One of the most valuable projects for a beginner in woodwork to 
make, looked at either from the point of view of the discipline of 
technique or from that of design, is a tray for pens or cards, trinkets 
or pins, clips or collar buttons, or whatsoever. For varieties of trays 
see Fig. 165. 
The first matter to decide is, of course, the use of the tray. If 
it is to be for penholders and pencils, the trough must be long and 
  
    
    
Fig. 166. Trays. 
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
wide enough to receive them, and the tray must be stable, so as not 
to be easily upset. If for cards, or crackers, it must be so designed 
as to be easily picked up. A suitable wood for this project is sweet 
gum, because it is of close even texture, moderately soft, cuts clean, 
polishes well, and has a handsome color and figure. The fixing of the 
essentials is an easy matter. 
123  
-P-A-G-E-124
    
124 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
The beauty of the tray will depend upon the refinement of its 
proportions and such embellishments as there are in the way of carv- 
ing. These are very closely related in this project. That a pen-tray 
should not be bulky or clumsy goes without saying. But its lightness 
and grace may depend as much upon the carved embellishments, Fig. 
166, Nos. 1, 2, 3, as upon the modeling of the edge, Fig. 167. 
A few suggestions may be offered as to the use of line decoration. 
It is the simplest form of carving and yet lends itself to endless 
variety. See Figs. 168, 169. One danger in line design is that the 
lines be too “wiry” or “wormy”. This can be corrected by breaking

the lines and modifying the ends. It should also be remembered that 
the blank spaces, that is, those uncarved, should make a pleasing pat- 
tern, as well as the carved lines themselves. The rosette design, 
shown in Fig. 170, is a pure line design, so arranged that the blank 
spaces make a rosette. An interesting discussion of the breaking up 
of spaces will be found in Ernest A. Batchelder’s Design in Theory 
and Practice. 
In making the tray itself the processes are few and simple, but 
like all good carving, require careful control of the hand, and call for 
considerable variety of manipulation. 
Taking for illustration a typical tray, the pen-tray with rosettes, 
shown in Fig. 170, first, with the plane, true up the working face, 
working edge, length, width, and thickness. If the design is not 
rectangular, but has curved outlines, it is necessary to true up only 
working face, working edge, and thickness.
-P-A-G-E-125
  TRAYS 125 
To lay out the design, draw on the working face, center lines, one 
lengthwise, one crosswise, at exact right angles to each other. Draw 
similar lines on the design. 
Lay the design already drawn in paper on a piece of glass, and 
with a sharp knife point, make a clean cut stencil of one quarter of

  it. Where necessary to prevent the stencil from becoming too weak 
or falling apart leave little bridges to hold the parts together, as A A, 
in Fig. 171. 
From this stencil, lay out the design on each quarter of the work- 
ing face of the board. If it is necessary to pin it in place, do so in 
places where the pin pricks will afterward be cut away. This is more 
important in a fine textured wood like gum than in a coarse textured 
wood like oak. 
As to when the outline is to be cut, that depends upon its shape. 
If it is nearly rectangular, it may be shaped before the trough is dug, 
but ordinarily, and especially if it is curved, it is better not to touch 
it, until trough and decoration are finished. In this rectangular 
shape, the edges will not be bruised while handling and it will be
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
easier to hold the piece between the bench-stop and vise-dog. For 
irections for shaping the outline, see below. 
Next gouge out the trough of the tray with a large (1”) outside 
bevel gouge. Work both with the grain and across it, noting care-

fully any dips in the grain, and taking particular pains at those 
places. Do not attempt to work within 1%” of the margin of the 
trough, until the main part is well gouged out. That is, leave the
-P-A-G-E-127
  TRAYS 127 
finest work till later, because with every added stroke greater control 
of the hand is gained. For use of gouge on ordinary cuts, see Hand- 
work in Wood, p. 60. 
For delicate cuts learn to use the twisting motion i.e., while push- 
ing the handle with the right hand, gently twist the gouge on its

axis. This motion is particularly useful when approaching an out- 
line, as of the trough. Twist away from the outline then if the 
tool slips no harm is done. 
Particular pains must be taken with the corners of the trough if 
there are any. In general they look better rounded. The are of the 
round should not be greater than the are of the gouge which you have 
to use. The sharper the corner, the harder it is to cut it out well. 
For very accurate work, and where the cross-section of the tray 
is uniform for some distance, as in Fig. 172, it is well to make a 
templet of thin wood with 
which the work can be gaged 
as one proceeds. 
But in many trays (as in 
Fig. 170) all that is necessary 
is to have a depth-gage. For 
this purpose a nail driven into a strip of wood having a straight edge 
will suffice, Fig. 173. With this it is easy to detect variations which 
make the work look slovenly. The curve of the edges of the trough

papering, irregularities in the surface undetected before will appear. 
If so, go back to the scraper, or even the gouge. But remember that 
the fine particles of sand rubbed into wood, will quickly dull edge tools. 
Next cut out whatever decoration there is in the design. If this 
is a mere line design. as in Fig. 165, Nos. 2, 6 and 11, one tool is

sufficient to cut it all out. This tool must be sharp, so sharp that it 
will cut soft wood across the grain clean without any tearing. Ordi- 
narily no scraping or sandpapering will follow line decoration. 
Be careful at the ends of the lines. Do not let them fade away, 
as A, in Fig. 175, but finish clean and round, as at B. 
For quite fine lines, as in Fig. 172, a veining tool, so called, is 
used. This is simply a very small gouge, and has to be whetted with 
a slipstone having a knife edge. Such a design

ROLLING BLOTTER-HOLDER 
The essential features of a convenient rolling blotter-holder are 
that it be the proper size and shape, say an oblong not larger than 
31%4"x614”"; that it be easily grasped; that the blotter be so fastened 
as to be easily changed; and that the blotter be properly cushioned. 
In the device shown in Fig. 179 these requirements are met. The 
construction is as follows: A dowel on which a thread has been cut, 
is screwed and glued into the knob, while the part projecting from 
the knob passes freely thru a hole in the cover, 4” thick, and screws 
into the rounded part, Fig. 180. 
The wood suggested is sweet gum, like the pen-tray described in 
the preceding chapter. 
The proportions are largely determined by its use, the knob alone 
admitting of great variety in outline. The knob as well as the back 
may well be decorated with a pattern in harmony with that of the 
tray. See Fig. 181. : 
The making of the blotter shown in Fig. 182 will be described. 
The materials needed are of sweet gum as follows: 
A. I piece, 34”x3”x5” (full). 
B. I piece, 4”x3”x5” (full). 
C. 1 piece, 1’x1”x2” and 
1 dowel-rod, 34”. 
The new tool needed is a screw-box and a wood tap, size 3%”. 
True up to size and dress carefully the two larger pieces A and B. 
Locate the center of each of these pieces. Bore a 34” hole thru B, 
and a 5/16” hole thru A, and a 5/16” hole into and nearly thru 0 
at the center of one side. Take great pains to bore perpendicularly 
to the surface. With the tap, cut the threads in the holes, in A and C. 
Select a straight grained piece of dowel-rod 34” diameter, and 
on one end by means of the screw-box cut a thread for two inches or 
more. If the box tears off the thread instead of cutting it clean, take

it apart, see that the cutter is sharp, reassemble, and try again. A 
little adjustment of the cutter back and forth may be necessary to 
get the best cut. Cut off two inches of the screw thus formed, work 
a little glue into hole—the 1” square piece, and screw in the dowel. 
  Fig. 180, Rolling blotter-holder. 
Now shape up the knob to the form desired. A piece 2” long was 
selected at the start in order to avoid the danger of splitting it while 
boring into it the 5/16” hole. Cut off the surplus 14” from each end, 
lay out the form on the two opposite sides, and with the chisel, gouge 
it and (or) file it and bring it into shape. If it is angular, it must 
be shaped by hand; if it is round, it may be turned on a lathe, if 
one is available. Shaping the knob by hand, is very difficult. Some 
may find it easy to whittle it inte shape with a penknife.

If one is a novice at the lathe, do not try the wood turner’s tan- 
gential cuts, but be content to scrape this piece into shape. Wrap a 
thickness or two of stiff paper around the projecting part of the screw 
and fasten it firmly but not violently into a three jawed chuck, and

SMALL BOXES 
The size of such a box as is contemplated in this project is de- 
termined by its use. If it is for gloves it should be approximately 
4”x5"x12". If for men’s handkerchiefs, about 6” square and 4” or 
5” deep. If for stationery, then to fit the stationery. In any case, 
the only safe way is to measure the proposed contents and make the 
box to fit. 
The wood suggested is mahogany or black walnut or oak, all 
strong, handsome woods. For the joints possible, see Handwork in 
Wood, pp. 187-190. 
In refining the proportions, sometimes even a slight modification 
from the dimensions which mere utility requires will give a more 
pleasing effect. Looking at each outer surface separately it may be 
said that oblongs are more pleasing than squares, or looking at the 
box as a whole, that cubes or multiples of cubes are to be avoided. 
For embellishment the modifications suggested are: 
(1) Extended tops and bottoms, as in Fig. 185, No. 3, with the 
edges modified by moldings. 
(2) A simple outline of inlay. 
The main esthetic reliance, however, should be on good propor- 
tion, accuracy of workmanship, and beauty of finish. 
The directions following are for the construction of a trinket box, 
3” deep x4” wide x?” long, outside measurements, of stock 5/16” 
thick when hand dressed. Fig. 185, No. 4. 
The material may be black walnut or mahogany, and the follow- 
ing pieces are required: 
2 pieces 34"x3"x7%", 
2 pieces 34”x3"x4”, 
2 pieces 34”x44"x7%".

138 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
The grain of the wood in the four sides of a box should always 
run parallel, that is it should run either around the box or up and 
down. The reason is that with equal conditions of grain, any shrinkage 
that takes place will be even. In general the grain runs the long way 
of each piece. In this case of a long box, the grain should run around. 
  
  
  
        
Fig. 185, Small boxes. 
When not working on the pieces keep them clamped together in 
handscrews, (as in Fig. 5, p. 19) or at least keep them wrapped up 
in a paper to prevent them from uneven exposure and consequent 
warping. 
In dressing up the pieces, proceed as follows: Cut from the wood, 
two pieces about 344” wide and 12” long. Each will serve for one 
side and end, and each is to be kept in one piece thru as many proc- 
esses as possible. Plane up the working face, the working edge, one 
end, the width, 274”, and the thickness, 5/16”. The width should be 
3” if the top is to be put on with a double rabbet joint, Fig. 186 B. 
To fix the length of the end pieces, from the dressed end of each 
12” piece measure off 334”, score all around with a sharp knife and 
a try-square, cut a groove for the saw, (Handwork in Wood, Fig. 91.) 
but do not cut off. First plow the rabbets. 
   
-P-A-G-E-139
  SMALL BOXES 139 
With the rabbet-plane plow the rabbets, 3/16” deep and 5/16” 
wide, on what will be the lower inside edge of the sides and ends. This 
is to receive the bottom. For di- 
rections for rabbeting, see p. 72. 
If the top of the box is to be 
affixed with its full thickness 
showing, as in Fig. 186, A, no 
rabbet is cut on the upper edges 
of sides and ends. But a neater 
and stronger joint is the double 
rabbet joint shown in Fig. 186, 
B. If this is to be used, rabbet 
out the upper edges of the 12” 
pieces with a rabbet 3/16” 
deep and 3/16” wide. 
Next saw off what will be the 
end pieces of the box and block- 
plane them true. 
  Fig. 186. Methods of affixing top of box. 
Be careful that both ends are of exactly the same 
size, 5/16"x274"x334", and all angles square. On both ends of each 
side piece, cut rabbets, (Handwork in Wood, page 179, No. 24) with

  the shoulders 63%” apart, the 
rabbet 3/16” deep, and let the 
surplus length remain for the 
present. It can be trimmed off 
after the box is put together. 
See Fig. 187. 
Make these end rabbets as 
follows: Score and groove the 
shoulders with the try-square 
and knife. From this line 
score across the edges for ap- 
proximately 3/16”. Wuiih the

ends and on the edges beyond

grooved. With the back-saw, saw in the groove down to the gaged lines.

square and surfaces flat. The squareness of the box depends absolutely 
upon the accuracy of this rabbet joint. ‘The sides and ends may now be 
assembled. Start brads (7¢” No. 20) in lines 34” from the ends of the 
  Fig 188. Location of brads in end of box. box ends, as in Fig. 188. 
The reasons for this careful 
ocation are: at the double dot- 
ed line 4%” apart, the box is to 
be cut in two, the upper part 
making the lid and the lower the 
box proper, and hence no brads 
must be in the way of the saw; 
and, second, the lower brad can- 
not safely be less than 14” from 
he lower edge on account of 
he inserted bottom. Start the 
brads so that they will be driven 
slightly outward, as in Fig. 189. 
Drive the brads until the 
points just prick thru. Put a 
ittle liquid glue on the joints, 
put the parts together accu-         rately, draw the sides up to the ends with a handscrew, being care-

that they are exactly square. If instead of liquid glue, hot glue is 
used, everything must be in readiness beforehand, so that the work 
may proceed as fast as possible, before the glue sets. Set aside to dry. 
     
-P-A-G-E-141
  SMALL BOXES 141 
The neatest way to conceal the holes made by the brads is this: 
Sharpen the end of a splinter of the same kind of wood as the box 
itself, so that it just fits a brad 
hole, dip the end in glue, tap it 
lightly into the hole with the 
hammer, cut it off with a sharp 
knife or chisel, sharpen the 
splinter again and so proceed 
till all the holes are plugged up. 
While the frame is drying 
the top and bottom may be 
worked up according to the di- 
rections given below. 
When the frame of the box 
is dry, test the upper and lower 
edges on a face plate, or some 
perfectly flat surface. If it 
rocks at all, note where and 
carefully plane it flat. In doing 
so, take care not to bump the

toe or the heel of the plane into the inner arrises of the sides or ends, 
as at A and B, Fig. 190. 
Another way to bring the edges into plane, is to lay a sheet of 
sandpaper (No. 1) on a perfectly flat surface and rub the box back 
  Fig. 191. Danger of rounding the corners, as at A, B. and forth on it. 
The danger here 
is of rounding 
over the cor- 
ners, as at A 
and B, Fig. 191. 
Next plane up 
the top and the 
bottom of the 
box, remember- 
ing to choose the better looking piece for the top. 
If the top is to be affixed with a butt joint, as in Fig. 186 A, it 
may well be thinned to 4” or even 3/16”, because if thin, it is more 
easily kept from warping by the boxed part of the lid. Do not try

  142 DESIGN AND er CTION IN WOOD 
to fit the butt jointed top to the exact size of the box, but plane only 
the two faces. It can be dressed off after it is glued on. 
If the top is to be rabbeted into the sides and ends, as in Fig. 
186, B, these rabbets in the top may now be plowed. Plane up the 
top square, but slightly larger than it will be when the box is fin-

ished. Plow out the rabbets 3/16” deep, and wide enough, just over 
y%”, so that the top will fit easily into its place. The bottom is to 
be 5/16” thick, and to be fitted exactly into the space rabbeted for it. 
Clean out any dried glue that there may be in the corners, apply a 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  SMALL BOXES 143 
thin film of glue to the joints, brad the bottom firmly into place, 
driving the brads thru the bottom up into the sides, and then set 
their heads. 
Fasten the top without brads using only glue, hot glue, if pos- 
sible. Since it has not yet been dressed to exact size, take care that 
the edges overlap all around. 
In gluing on the top protect both it and the bottom by placing 
between the box and the handscrews other boards, otherwise the 
pressure of the handscrews may bend and even crack the top and 
bottom. Use plenty of handscrews. (See Fig. 192.) 
When dry, say in six hours, dress off, sawing, if necessary, the pro- 
jecting ends and edges. Take care not to splinter the corners. 
Next, cut the box 
in two thus: With the 
marking-gage, gage two 
parallel lines, 34” and 
J" respectively, from 
the upper surface of 
the top. Between these 
two lines saw the box 
apart with the back- 
saw, Fig. 193. For a 
larger box, the rip-saw 
would be used. 
Now plane eachset = :

to the gaged line, and then test on a face plate, (flat surface) to see 
that they are in a plane. Finally test the cover thus: Lay it in place 
and tap each corner with the finger to see if it rests firm there. Ex- 
amine the crack all around and correct any errors. Round the external 
arrises if desired (See Fig. 194) but in any case do not leave them 
sharp, except where the box and its lid meet. Clean up and sandpaper. 
Setting the hinges. (See Handwork in Wood, pp. 131-133.) The 
hinges should be set about the length of the hinge from the ends of the 
box. Mark with the knife the length of the hinge on the edge of the 
back of the box, taking the length of the hinge from the hinge itself, 
by superposition. (Handwork in Wood, p. 204). Square across the 
edge with the try-square and knife. Do this for both hinges. Hold the      
-P-A-G-E-144

lid of the box in its proper place on the box as it will rest when shut, 
and mark the places for the hinges on the edge of the back of the lid, 
and square across for both hinges. Between these lines on both the in- 
side and outside of the box and of the lid, gage the proper depth of the 
notch, i. e., one half the thickness of the knuckle of the hinge. 
Chisel out the notches, set the hinges in place, drill or brad-awl the 
holes for a tight fit and drive the screws. Lubricate them with soap 
      Fig 194. a stationery box, external arrises slightly rounded.   
before driving; otherwise they may break. If rightly done the lid 
should shut tight all around with no springing back. If it does spring 
back, the hinges are set too deep, and it is necessary to loosen the screws 
and set in a shaving under the hinge. If there is a gap between the 
box and the lid at the back, the hinges need to be set in a little more 
deeply. If the sides of the lid do not lie flush with the sides of the 
box, one hinge is set further toward the outside side of the box than 
the other. If this difference is very slight, it may be corrected by loos- 
ening the screws a little and gently but firmly twisting the lid around 
in the right direction. If the discrepancy is great, notice carefully  
-P-A-G-E-145
SMALL BOXES 145 
where the error is, take out the screws that are wrongly placed, cut little 
plugs of wood, dip in glue, drive into the screw holes, and bore new 
holes for the screws. 
If a lock is needed for the box, see Handwork in Wood, p. 134, for 
directions for inserting it. 
If the box has been made of mahogany it may now be stained in the 
same way as the candle-stick. See p. 92. 
It looks well to stain only the outside including the edges where 
the lid meets the box, and to leave the inside unstained, as in Fig. 194. 
When the stain is thoroly dry, and the surface well rubbed down 
with steel wool, give the outside a coat of Wheeler’s Patent Paste 
Wood Filler, No. 7, (see Handwork in Wood, p. 213). Mix this filler 
with enough turpentine to make it the consistency of thin paste, 
apply with a brush with the grain, and as it dries, but before it sets 
hard, rub off the surplus carefully across the grain. The object of 
the filler is to fill up the pores of the wood and give a smooth even 
surface. The filler should dry for twenty-four hours. Then apply 
successive coats of shellac, rub ed down with steel wool, and, if de- 
sired, French polish it. (See Handwork in Wood, p. 21%.) 
If the box is of walnut, 
(Wheeler No. 10) will darken 
Tf the design of the box ca no stain is needed. A black filler 
it a little. 
1s for a projecting bottom and top, as 
in Fig. 185, No. 3, several parts of the construction are different. 
The sides and ends are not ral beted to receive either bottom or top, 
which are glued and nailed directly on their edges. 
In gluing on a top which has been finished to size, and perhaps 
made with molded edges, pains must be taken not to let it slip when 
the pressure of the handscrews is applied. One method of prevent- 
ing this is as follows: drive four brads into the upper edges of the 
sides, bite off the heads with t e nippers and sharpen the projecting 
points. Set the top exactly in place and press it down so that the 
brads will penetrate. When tl 
enter the same holes, and the toy he glue is applied see that the brads 
will remain true in place.

Instead of the rabbet joint described, which has the disadvantage 
of the brad holes showing, several others are feasible as described in 
Handwork in Wood, page 187. 
Box construction of a more simple form may be made use of in 
making bird-houses, as shown in Fig. 195. The necessity for mak- 
ing opposite sides of exactly the same size holds here as in all rect-

LANTERNS 
This project consists essentially of a frame covered with translu- 
cent paper or cloth. Fig. 196. It may be worked out in two dif- 
ferent ways, either as a hanging lantern, Fig. 197, suspended by 
chains, or a lantern supported on the wall by a suitable hook, or on 
a bracket, Fig. 196, Nos. 1 and 4. 
Either form may be so designed as to be lit either by a candle 
or by an electric light. The electric light is, of course, safer. In 
case a candle is used, a suitable socket and pan for the candle are 
essential, and the tantern must be large enough go that the flame of 
the candle cannot set fire to it. In the case of the wall lantern, the 
wall may be protected by a metal screen. Aside from these considera- 
tions, considerable latitude is possible. 
The wood chosen for this project is yellow poplar because it is 
not likely to be split by the fastenings used. It has, besides, a 
smooth even texture that finishes well. 
In a project as nearly rectangular as this, the chief consideration 
is to have a satisfying relation of height to width; that is, the faces 
are to be pleasing rectangles rather than squares. 
The embellishments may take various forms. In Figs. 197 and 
198, both the hanging lantern and wall lantern have the simplest 
possible frame with the interest centering in the stencils cut on the 
paper. In Fig. 196, Nos. 2 and 3, the pattern is made by the slats 
cross-lapped. The chain instead of being simple, as in Fig. 197, may 
have links of varying lengths. 
Since in Fig. 196, Nos. 1 and 4, the lantern consists of a screen 
set on a bracket which also holds the candle, the design of the 
bracket should harmonize with the screen. (See Handwork in Wood, 
page 185).

I. The suspended tantern with the wood fret, Fig. 196, No. 2. 
The ‘wood selected for this is yellow poplar, 5/16” thick. The 
following sizes are required: 
For the corners, which may be called stiles, 
4 pieces, 5/16’x34”x8”, 
4 pieces, 5/16”x7/16"x8”. 
For the cross-pieces, which may be called rails, 
4 pieces, 5/16”x1%4"x4%" (upper rails), 
4 pieces, 5/16’x134”"x4%” (lower rails). 
All to be of exactly the same length and properly shaped before assembling. 
For the horizontal cross slats, 
4 pieces 5/16’x56" x4”. 
For the muntins (vertical slats), 
8 pieces 5/16”x56"x514”. 
Prepare all these pieces, remembering that it is easier to work 
with as long pieces as it is convenient to plane and then to cut these 
up to the proper lengths afterward. Since there is a considerable 
number to be cut to the same length, fasten a stop at the proper place 
in the miter-box and saw off the pieces, measuring mechanically by 
that means. See Fig. 131. 
If these are carefully cut it will not be necessary to dress the 
ends of the rails or slats. The ends of the stiles should be carefully 
smoothed. Shape the rails with chisel and spokeshave. 
Next lay out and cut and fit the cross-lap joints of the slats. 
(Directions for making this joint are given on p. 155 of Handwork in 
Wood). Glue these together. 
Next make up the corner posts by gluing together, as in Fig. 199. 
When dry, dress off the outer surfaces of the joints so that they 
will be quite flush. The whole may now be assembled. 
On a flat board, leaving a space about 1” wider than the entire 
width of the lantern, nail strips of wood about 9” long parallel to 
each other, as A, A, Fig. 200. Prepare two wedges, B, B, 8” long, 
5/16” thick, and tapering from 5%” wide to a point, and a buffer 
strip, C. 
Lay the pieces of one side, outside down, in their proper position 
in this space. Put in the strip C and drive in the wedges B, B, mak- 
ing all true and square, and seeing that there is no buckle. 
At all the joints drive in 3/16” corrugated fasteners. Repeat 
on all sides. Stain the whole with brown oil stain and rub well.

Fig. 198, Wall lantern. : the simplest joint for 
such small pieces is the end-lap. Dress up all the parts and cut to 
he desired lengths, (stiles 8%” long, rails 334”). The fitting to- 
gether is a fine delicate job, requiring twelve distinct joints. If the 
lantern is made larger, say twice as large, the joints may be butt 
joints and doweled together. (For directions, see 
Handwork in Wood, p. 152, No. 8). Or, it may be 
ut together with corrugated fasteners, as in the 
hanging lantern (Fig. 200). 
To make the end lap joint see Handwork in 
Wood, p. 156, No. 16. When the parts are glued FE ects

gon, so that its sides shall be just equal to the short (inside) width 
of the panels.

To lay out the hexagon, with a compass, draw a circle whose 
radius is equal to the desired length of one of the six sides. As only 
half the circle is required place one leg of the compass on the edge 
of the board. From the point where the circumference touches the 
  Fig. 200. Method of clamping up the parts. 
edge of the board, step off on the circumference a distance equal to 
the radius. Repeat from the opposite point of the circumference, 
and connect by straight lines the points thus obtained, a, b, c, d, and 
the half-hexagon desired is drawn. Also inscribe a smaller circle of 
2%4” radius to make room for the candle-stick which is fastened to 
the bracket. See Fig. 202. Saw and plane out this shape. 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
154 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD 
For gluing the panels together, prepare a few forms of the shape 
shown in Fig. 203. Put a thin film of glue (liquid glue will do) on 
those edges of the panels which are to be jointed, and with small 
brads, (1” No. 18) nail the panels in place to the half hexagon bot- 
tom. Clamp the panels together with small handscrews, using the 
  
  Fig. 201. Working drawing of lantern shown in Fig. 19. 
forms just made. See Handwork in Wood, p. 171, Fig. 258, and 
p. 170, 2nd paragraph. When dry, clean up. 
The frame should be stained and finished before the stencils are 
put on. Hence it is better to make the bracket next, so that all the 
staining may be done together. See below for directions for making 
the bracket. 
The stencils are cut out of sheets of brown paper which fit the 
insides of the panels. (See p. 152.) 
Cut three pieces of silk of the same size as the stencils, and of an 
harmonious tint, and tack both paper and silk, (silk toward the
-P-A-G-E-155

candle) to the inside edges of the panels by means of thin strips of 
wood and small brads, say 44”, No. 20. Tack these strips all around 
the inside of each panel. 
The shelf of the bracket should conform in design to the lantern. 
The material for the bracket may also be 5/16” thick. If possible 
  
          
  
  
    
Fig, 202. Working drawing of lantern shown in Fig. 198, 
make all the parts, shelf, back, and two supports, out of one board, 
planing first the working face and working edge, and the exact thick- 
ness. Lay out the plans on this and cut out roughly. The shelf over- 
hangs the back when assembled. The back and shelf can now be 
finished exactly to shape by means of the plane, or if irregular in

shape with the spokeshave and chisel also. In order to make the two 
supports exactly alike, glue them together thus: Put a touch of glue } 
at several points on one piece, 
press a piece of paper over it, 
put glue on the other side of 
the paper at the points oppo- 
X 9 co” site those already glued, lay on 
the other piece and clamp to- 
esa Danae beetaeeEE Pal gether. When dry, proceed as 
if they were one piece, finishing carefully. When shaped, they may 
be pried apart with a chisel, and what little glue adheres may be 
planed off. Or, the two pieces may be handscrewed together, while 
eat Fig. 205. Methods of hanging the bracket.   
  
  
  
they are shaped. Assemble the parts of the bracket as in Fig. 204. 
First draw light pencil lines on the top of the shelf and on the back 
of the back, to indicate where the brads (1” No. 18) are to be driven 
into the supports, start two brads along 
each of these lines, driving them thru 
the boards until the points prick thru, 
and also driving brads thru the shelf 
to go into the back. 
Now, holding one of the supports in 
the vise, lay the back on it in its proper 
place and drive in the brad nearest the 
shelf. By means of the try-square hold 
the back exactly in place over this sup- 
port, and drive in the other brad. Re- 
peat with the other support. : 
Next brad the shelf and back to- 
gether, having the shelf overhang the 
back. See that the supports are 
squarely in place and drive home the 
brads thru the top into them. Stain the bracket to match the screen. Fig 204. Location of brads.

LANTERNS 157 
For hanging the bracket, gain into the back small copper or brass 
strips with holes in them, as shown in Fig. 205, or insert small screw- 
eyes (No. 21414) at the back edge of the shelf. Place these hang- 
ers so as not to interfere with the screen. 
If electricity is available it is of course much safer to have a 
small electric light bulb take the place of the candle.

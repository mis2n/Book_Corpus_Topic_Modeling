  Prince Kropotkin tells of a Russian woman 
of wealth who asked, “Why should my son 
be burdened with the study of geography, 
when the family coachman can take him to 
any place he needs to visit?” There was 
some sense in the lady’s question. Why, 
indeed, study mere facts of geography as if 
the acquiring of them were an end in itself? 
It is a sound principle of pedagogy that the 
relation of facts to life and culture shall be 
made apparent to the young student. That 
principle underlies this volume of Unit 
Studies in Geography. Here is a guide that 
points out directly or by apt questioning 
the relationships between different facts con- 
cerning our world and the bearing of these 
facts on our own lives. Here a specialist in 
the teaching of geography offers her effective 
aid in. presenting the subject under any 
course of study and with any basal text. 
Just this thing has not been done before, and 
the publication of Miss Clark’s book is a 
distinctive addition to the publishers’ list of 
“Books that apply the world’s knowledge to 
the world’s needs”

PREFACE 
Tuts book is made up of a series of units of study in 
geography. The units have been selected primarily to suit 
children’s needs and interests; secondarily, to conform to 
business practices and social ideals. The child’s world and 
the world of business and society thus become identical — 
and that is one of the great purposes of modern geography 
teaching. 
The unit studies outlined here provide the teacher with 
a working plan that is both flexible and individual. They 
show the connection between the child’s present interests 
and the geographical subject which he is to investigate. 
They suggest materials for him to work with and the way 
to use such materials. They are planned to start the child 
on the road to straight, clear thinking by giving him some- 
thing to think about and suggesting ways to do his thinking. 
Much of the school material that we put before children 
is so thin that there is nothing in it to think about! In 
self-defense the child resorts to mere memory work and 
acquires a few unrelated, comparatively meaningless facts 
in geography. And yet, real geography can interpret the 
world to the eager, wondering child! 
The unit studies outlined here may be used with any 
course of study and with any textbook. Since each unit is 
made independent of any other, it may be taken in the 
order which best suits local needs. The order in which they 
are given here has been tried out in many schools and has 
proved generally satisfactory. There is nothing arbitrary 
about it, however. 
About eight or ten units will make a full year’s work. 
If a few local studies are added and the units are arranged 
in the order which best suits the local school program, 
a course of study in geography may be made which is 
peculiarly your own. 
The superintendent or supervisor may select the units 
he wishes to include in a year’s work. He arranges them 
im

in the order that best suits his general program. He adds 
three or four unit studies on local geography. He makes 
the course flexible by giving the teacher some choice of the 
units which she may wish to emphasize in any given grade 
or year. 
It is hoped that these studies may simplify the work of 
the teacher of geography by defining exactly the units 
which she is to prepare to teach in a given year. For the 
busy superintendent or supervisor, it is hoped that the unit 
studies may suggest a very practical way of building his 
own course of study in geography.

PART ONE 
UNIT STUDIES FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
  
A FOREWORD TO THE PRIMARY TEACHER 
Turrz are two series of unit studies in primary geography, 
“Geography of Everyday Life” and ‘The World Outside.” 
“Geography of Everyday Life” is planned to help the child 
understand his own environment. These unit studies are 
chosen with a view to opening the child’s eyes to the things 
around him. He is surprisingly blind to some of his every- 
day surroundings; to others, he has an open mind and an 
eager curiosity. We wish to use this present interest to 
lead him into new fields of his environment. 
The units outlined here are to be made the basis of in- 
formal conversational lessons. They are simple studies on 
subjects of everyday experience. References to textbooks 
and to suitable supplementary books are given, so that the 
child may have an opportunity to read for himself, after 
each unit has been carefully introduced and discussed; or 
the teacher may prefer to use some of this reference material 
as a basis for her own discussion with the class. 
It is not intended that the unit studies of these series 
should be taken continuously. Alternate them with units 
from ‘The World Outside” series, and thus avoid the 
monotony of a too continuous demand upon the child for 
the same form of observation. 
The unit studies in “The World Outside” series were 
planned to help the child see how other people live. The 
“human types” were chosen because their environment 
and mode of life contrast sharply with his own, and because 
their response to physical environment is direct and easily 
understood. : 
These lessons, too, are informal and conversational. The 
reference lists suggest material suitable for extended silent

    2 FOREWORD 
reading. After a child has entered into a vigorous class 
discussion of one of these units and has read some of the 
story material, he should have the chance to stand up and 
talk freely on some subjects of his own choice. Perhaps he 
would like to stand by the sand table (which the children 
have previously arranged) and use it to illustrate his talk. 
Primary geography furnishes natural and delightful oppor- 
tunities for extended silent reading and for oral English. 
The children should also be encouraged to make short 
“‘write-ups” of phases of the unit study which have proved 
particularly interesting.

A. THE GEOGRAPHY OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
UNIT’ t. DIRECTION 
Time required: 1 to 2 weeks 
Disclose the need for a knowledge of direction by questions 
like the following: Your cousin in Denver wishes to know 
just where you live. How can you tell him in a letter? 
How do you go to your home from the post office? from 
the schoolhouse? from the railroad station? (Show that 
the terms right and left are not sufficient in locating 
places.) 
Fix north as the first direction. A few minutes before 
noon, stand with your back to the sun; now you are looking 
north. This is true all the year. It is not true that the 
sun rises in the east and sets in the west, except in March 
and September. For that reason do not fix those directions: 
in that way, except in March and September. Now fix 
other cardinal directions from north; then the semi-car- 
dinal directions. In an out-of-doors lesson, call attention 
to the direction of shadows at noon. Suggest that a line 
following this noon shadow direction is called our noon 
line or meridian. Help the children to imagine that 
line as it extends far north and far south. It passes through 
many interesting places, where strange people live; yet 
their noon shadows are on that line, and their noon comes 
just when ours does. 
Drill questions. Face east. Point north. Name two 
objects in the room that are south of you. What direction 
are you facing as you sit at your desk? In what direction 
is the nearest church? In what direction is the river or 
creek from the schoolhouse? In what direction does it flow? 
Draw on the floor a diagram of an eight-pointed star, 
showing the cardinal and semi-cardinal points. Teach 
these directions. Now'let eight children occupy the eight 
points. Name any two points and ask the children to 
change places.

4 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
Continue direction drill for a few minutes at frequent 
intervals throughout the year. Discover other methods of 
telling directions, as moss on trees, North Star, length and 
direction of shadows, the compass. Encourage the chil- 
dren to think about the noon line and to use the new word 
meridian,

UNIT 2. DISTANCE AND SIZE 
Time required: 1 to 2 weeks 
Norz. To help a child appreciate distances on the earth. 
Ideas of distance are necessary in order to understand 
how large the world is and how far apart places are. Begin 
by teaching the length of a foot. Do not teach twelve 
inches, but try to give the child a correct’ mental picture 
of the length of a foot. 
Drill questions and estimating size. Have the children 
hold their hands a foot apart. Measure. Let the child 
tell whether they are too close or too far. Point to objects 
in the room a foot long. Measure them. Draw a line a 
foot long. Draw a line twice as long as a foot. Point to 
lines or objects in the room two feet long. Walk within 
two feet of the teacher; then face east. Draw on the 
blackboard a line three feet long. This is called a yard. 
Point to some objects a yard long. How long are the desk, 
the wall map, a picture on the wall, etc.? What is the 
length of a step or pace? Pace the schoolroom, the school 
yard. 
Teach the mile by some well-known distance. How many 
blocks make a mile? How long does it take you to walk a 
mile? How many miles is it from your house (or town) 
to the next town? How long does it take to go there by 
train or automobile? Who has had a long journey on the 
train? Where did you go? How many meals did you eat 
on the trip? How many nights did you sleep on the train? 
Trace on the globe some of the long journeys the children 
have had, and estimate the distance. Judging by these trips 
over parts of the United States, estimate the entire distance 
across our continent. Who has traveled to Europe? How 
long did it take? How far is it across the Atlantic to France? 
Prepare for later work by this estimation of distance in 
terms of time required to travel over it. Repeat, at fre- 
quent intervals, drills in telling direction and in estimating 
distance and size.

  UNIT 3. SURFACE FEATURES IN YOUR 
NEIGHBORHOOD 
Time required: 1 to 2 weeks 
Purpose. That the child may learn to observe and 
recognize some simple geographic forms and to summarize 
his observations in statements that will prove true in later 
work. 
(A) Hitis anp VaLieys 
Select a hill to illustrate this lesson. It should be con- 
venient and conspicuous and should have several slopes 
and a definite summit. Teach the terms summit, base, foot, 
slopes (steep, gentle, abrupt, gradual), ridge, valley, bluff. 
Nore. In case such a hill is not easily accessible, model one on 
the sand table and develop the terms from this. 
A few suggestive questions. How many sides has this 
hill? What is the top called? the foot? the sides? What 
can you see from the summit? In what direction is your 
home? How do you walk downhill? Why do you come 
more slowly uphill? About how high is this hill? (Compare 
with near-by trees, houses, windmills, etc., to estimate 
height.) Teach the term horizon. Show that “each up- 
ward step widens the horizon.” What is the longest slope 
in your neighborhood? the steepest slope? the widest valley? 
Uses of hills. Are wagon roads usually located over the 
highest hills? How about the railroads? Are the best 
farms on steep hills? How does a farmer usually make use 
of the steep hill slopes on his land? Are trees planted on 
hillsides? Are there more orchards on the north slopes or 
on the south slopes in your neighborhood? Are there more 
vacant lots in your town on the hill slopes or on the level 
land? How are houses built on hillsides? 
Summaries. Some summaries are excellent in this study 
of land forms. A hill is a piece of ground a little higher 
than the ground around it. The lower land between hills is 
called a valley. A plain is a broad, nearly level piece of ground.

(B) Mountains 
This discussion naturally follows the study of hills, al- 
though mountains may not be found in the child’s neigh- 
borhood and cannot be studied from nature. Use many 
pictures in this work. Ask the children to bring pictures, 
and select only those which illustrate clearly some definite 
phase of mountain scenery. Suggested list of terms: peak, 
precipice, chain, range, plateau, pass, canyon, timber line, 
snow line, landslide. 
Show differences between hills and mountains, in height, 
materials, slopes, vegetation. Describe the appearance of 
mountains, using every significant phrase you can find. 
Compare distant mountains with masses of sunset clouds. 
Give the idea of height by showing that some mountains 
reach above the clouds. 
Interesting topics. How I climbed a mountain. Moun- 
tain railroads. Animals that live on mountains. Plants 
that grow in the mountains. Why I should like to see the 
mountains. 
Uses of mountains. Minerals, forests, scenery, health 
resorts, influence on climate (very simply stated). 
Summaries. A mountain is a very high piece of ground, 
much higher than a hill. The peak is the top. A precipice 
is a steep part of the mountain side, almost as straight up 
and down as a wall. A chain is a ridge of mountains. A 
pass is the lowest crossing of the mountains.

Construction Work 
(a) Model in sand a hill with one long slope and one steep slope. 
(6) Locate roads, houses, orchards, a town, etc., by simple devices. 
(c) Model a mountain chain, with peaks, passes, precipices. Use 
cotton to represent snow on the summits. Point out the snow line 
and the timber line, using twigs or bits of evergreen to represent trees. 
Be sure to show one or two high flat plains, and introduce signs of life, 
as something to represent a ranch, with pasture land and cattle. 
In using your collection of pictures, select certain ones to illustrate 
clearly such phases as canyon, snow line, chain, pass, mountain rocks, 
peaks, mountain vegetation, etc. Number the pictures and distribute 
them to the class, asking each child to name the features he recognizes 
in his picture. This study of the pictures may be made the basis for 
oral and written language lessons.

UNIT 4. THE WORK OF RUNNING WATER 
Time required: 2 weeks 
The fate of the rain. Some of the water that falls as 
rain runs off and flows downhill to lower places where there 
are creeks and rivers. How does Run-off find the way to go? 
Where does it run the fastest? Did you ever see the water 
running down the road after a rain? What did it do to the 
road? Are the ditches it cuts dangerous for travel? What 
became of the material that used to fill these ditches? Are 
the ditches deeper in some parts of the road than in others? 
Where? What does the rain water look like as it runs down 
a steep place in the road? What is it carrying? Mud, sand, 
and gravel are the load the Run-off carries.. Does Run-off 
carry more mud and sand when it is going fast or when it is 
going slowly? Did you ever see water run down a slope in 
a plowed field? Did it do any harm? Does it work in the 
same way when it runs down a slope in a pasture? Why 
not? Where does the water go after it gets to the foot of 
the hill? (Suggest some definite slope, where the water 
runs into a drainpipe or into a ditch, thence to a creek or 
river.) Does Run-off carry its load all the way? If Run-off 
is picking up and carrying off mud and sand from the hill- 
sides and dropping it on the more level places, what is 
happening to the hills? Run-off is very busy making over 
the surface of the earth on which we live. For ages it has 
been carrying away material, bit by bit, and storing it in 
some lower place. So nearly all our hill sand valleys are 
formed by Run-off, because it has removed more material 
from some places than from others. 
Visit a stream and observe the following: source, slope, 
divide, tributary, fall, delta, drainage basin. Find miniature 
land and water forms here: peninsula, cape, bay, island, etc. 
Select a place along the stream where there are several 
tributaries not far apart. Do the tributaries join the main 
stream on a level or with a fall? Do they make an acute 
angle upstream or downstream with the main stream?

-P-A-G-E-16
  10 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
What change takes place in the width of the valley as 
you go downstream? Which is the right bank? the left 
bank? 
Uses of Streams. 
1. Lower hills and fill in valleys. 
2. Make natural railroad beds (as the Platte Valley or 
the Mohawk Valley). 
Furnish fish. 
Supply ice. 
Supply water for cities. 
Afford means of travel. 
Falls make power for lighting cities and for running 
street cars and manufacturing plants. 
8. Move logs downstream in a lumber region. 
Summaries. Some of the rain soaks into the ground 
and feeds wells and springs. This may be called Run-in or 
Soak-in. Run-off goes fastest down steep slopes. Mud, 
sand, and gravel are the load Run-off carries. The faster 
Run-off goes, the greater the load it can pick up and carry 
away. Some of the load is dropped when Run-off has to 
go more slowly. Run-off goes more slowly where slopes are 
gentle. A drainage basin is all the land whose Run-off feeds 
a stream. A divide is a ridge which has Run-off going down 
two opposite slopes. The source of a stream is where it 
begins. The land over which it flows is its bed. 
Where does the water in a stream come from? Where 
does it go? Why do we sometimes have floods in stream 
valleys? What harm does a flood do? What good may it 
do? Tell about the Nile River, and locate it on tlie globe. 
How are falls made? Tell about Niagara, and locate it on 
the globe. Sy 
Construction Work 
Model in sand (a) a stream basin with the right slope steep and the left 
slope gradual, (6) a basin with a stream having many tributaries which 
become longer toward the mouth, (c) in which there is a fall, (d) in which 
the left slope is broken by many small hills, (e) in which a railroad is 
represented as running along the valley and a bridge and town are shown,

UNIT 5. SOIL, AND SOIL FORMATION 
Time required: 1 to 2 weeks 
Nore. This topic should be given in the spring, when the home and 
school gardens are being planned and when the study can be motivated 
from the local gardening interests. 
Uses of soil. Necessary for life of plants and indirectly 
of animals. What would be the result if the earth were 
solid rock without a covering of soil? 
What soil is. Observe crumbling rock in buildings, 
foundations, ete. Take the class on a trip to a neighboring 
field where there are some partly decayed rocks. Discover 
(1) that soil is made of decayed and broken rock, (2) that 
the agents that break rock are rain, heat, cold, ice, roots 
of plants, animals. 
Appearance of soil. 
1. Color. Visit a cut in the road and see that soil is 
blacker near the surface. 
2. Fineness. Bring specimens of different soils in bottle. 
Rub particles between fingers to discover differences in size. 
Pour water on each kind. Which takes up water most 
quickly? Which takes up most water? Which retains the 
water longest? Then which soil will withstand dry weather 
best? 
Occurrence of soils. Secure specimens of soil from 
(a) the edge of a stream, (b) a steep slope, (c) a broad val- 
ley. Compare as to color, fineness, etc. 
Most children have heard discussions about good soils, 
poor soils, thin soils, soils suitable for different crops, etc. 
Lead them to recall these, and to cite local instances of 
different soils which have proved excellent for corn, alfalfa, 
wheat, clover, beets, potatoes, watermelons, etc. 
Kinds of soils. Clay, sand, humus. If soil is decayed or 
broken rock, why are some soils largely clay and others 
very sandy? What effect has vegetation on soil? 
Additional questions. What is done to enrich poor soils? 
How does the gardener or farmer prepare the soil for crops?

UNIT 6. THE AIR 
Time required: 2 to 4 weeks 
How I know that air is a real thing. Based on children’s 
experience with the wind. Grass and trees sway. Clouds 
move. Birds fly and float. Kites fly. Windmills turn. 
Wind ruffles child’s hair; blows his garments; etc. 
Why does air move? — Winds. Heat expands air; that 
is, the air particles get farther apart, causing the air to 
become lighter and to push out in all directions, but mostly 
upward because it is easiest to go in that direction. After it 
rises, the air becomes cooler and heavier and then settles. 
Such movements (upward and downward) also cause side- 
wise movements. These latter are called winds. 
Experiments. Put a feather over the radiator or the stove. 
Watch it as it rises toward the ceiling, then settles to the 
floor. It is following the motion of the air, which, being 
heated over the radiator, rises; then, being cooled as it comes 
near the ceiling, settles to the floor, carrying the feather 
with it. 
What the air does for us. Let the children make a list 
of all the uses of air they can think of. Suggested list: 
1. Necessary for the life of people, animals, and 
plants. 
Necessary for the fires that heat our homes and cook 
our food. 
Carries sound to our ears. 
Acts as a blanket to keep the earth warm. 
Carries water from one place to another. 
Helps make soil. 
Makes beautiful clouds. 
Causes our twilights. 
Gives us all our colors (not including black and white). 
“How hard and colorless is life without an atmos- 
phere.” 
10. Moving sidewise (wind) runs our windmills. 
11. Fills tires, footballs, ete.

  14 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
How air carries water — evaporation. Wherever there 
is any water, in whatever form it may be, some of it escapes 
into the air and is carried off. The warmer air is, the thirstier 
it is and the more water it takes away. As soon as water 
escapes into air, the water becomes invisible. 
Experiment. Trace a word on the blackboard with a wet 
cloth on the finger. Watch the word slowly disappear. What 
becomes of the water? Why do clothes hung on the line 
become dry? Why do muddy streets dry? What becomes 
of the water? Tell all the instances you can think of in which 
air has taken water. 
When air refuses to carry water — condensation. When 
air is cooled, it cannot carry all its load of invisible water. 
Then the water suddenly becomes visible and takes on many 
forms. Illustrations: Dew on the pitcher of ice water on a 
warm day. Steam on the kitchen windows. The breath, on 
a cold day. 
Forms of water in air: Rain, snow, hail, dew, frost, mist, 
fog, clouds. Kinds of clouds: Cumulus, the wool pack. 
Stratus, the layer cloud. Cirrus, the mare’s tail. Nimbus, 
the storm cloud.

  UNIT 7. THE NEEDS OF LIFE 
Time required: 6 to 8 weeks 
The aim of this study is to give the child some idea of his 
dependence upon many people of many lands for the neces- 
saries of life. From his previous “human type” studies, he 
has seen how the simple needs of those people are supplied 
from their immediate environment. He now turns with 
interest to the study of his own needs, and discovers that his 
environment does not satisfy them entirely, but that ma- 
terials for food, clothing, shelter, etc., are furnished to his 
own land from many remote ones. 
Introduce the first study by planning a Thanksgiving 
menu. Then discover where most of the articles of food 
come from. It is not intended that details of production or 
manufacture should be stressed, but rather that vivid general 
impressions should be produced. Appeal to the imagination 
in discussing the story of coffee, cocoa, bananas, etc. These 
stories might be given by the child in the first person. 
See Chamberlain: How We Are Fed, pages 178-185, for a 
type of such a story. 
For further material the child may be led to consult the 
index of his geography textbook. All texts contain extellent 
pictures, which should be listed for the five different topics. 
Information may also be gained from adults and from books 
of general information for children. 
These studies may be made the basis for oral and written 
English lessons; problems in arithmetic will also suggest 
themselves, with regard to cost, amounts, etc. 
It is not expected that all the articles listed should be 
» studied. Select those of inherent interest to the child, or 
those pertinent to the time or the locality. If advisable, 
assign selected articles to each child for investigation and 
reports. 
What we eat. Ask the children to make lists of common 
foods. ~

oranges, etc. Many of these contain pictures showing the growth or prepa- 
ration of the articles advertised. Point out on the globe the places mentioned 
in the advertisement. Cut small, bright-colored arrows and label each 
with the name of some food. With little thumb tacks, pin them to the 
globe in the proper place to show where each food is produced in great 
quantity. Show how the whole world contributes to furnish our food. 
Also make use of industrial exhibits from various food-manufacturing 
companies. 
Why do we not raise all our own food? Do we send any of 
our surplus food products to other countries? What food 
do we get from the Arabs? the Dutch? What from the 
Swiss? (Milk chocolate.)

  UNIT 9. MAP READING 
Time required: 2 or 3 weeks 
A map is a shorthand method of locating and describing 
places. This is done by means of symbols, usually lines, 
dots, squares, or colored areas, which do not look like the 
features they locate, but merely represent them. Children 
do not understand these symbols instinctively, as they do 
not think in symbols. In introducing the symbolism of 
maps to the child, begin with objects so simple in themselves 
that the child is free to think only of the symbol. Such an 
order as this might be followed: 
1. Map the child’s desk, showing objects on it which are 
unlike in form, such as inkwell, ruler, books, etc. Draw the 
outline of the desk top; then select the symbols for the ob- 
jects on the desk, as a small circle for the inkwell, a straight 
line for the pencil, a rectangle for the books, a longer, nar- 
rower rectangle for the ruler. Show the children that these 
symbols do not resemble the objects but stand for them. 
Often they represent the shape of the space the objects cover. 
Criticize the maps as to proportionate size and placing of 
the symbols. Call the attention of the children to the fact 
that all the desks are the same size, but all the maps they 
have made are not the same size. Thus show the need for 
scale in map making. Decide on a scale, as one inch on the 
map equals six inches on the desk; then make a second map 
of the desk to scale, using rules. 
2. Map the schoolroom, using symbols selected by the 
children for desks, benches, stoves or radiators, platform, 
and doors. Do not attempt to show small pieces of furni- 
ture, windows, or wall decorations. Show nothing that does 
not touch the floor, for the map is a representation of the 
floor plan. Draw to scale, letting one inch on the map equal 
two or four feet in the room. Show that this map of the 
schoolroom is not a picture. 
3. Map the school ground, or some part of it, selecting 
symbols for trees, walks, fountain, playground apparatus, 
ete. 
25
-P-A-G-E-32
  26 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
4. Let each child map his home grounds, if it seems 
advisable. 
5. It now becomes necessary to introduce the child to the 
symbols used in wall and textbook maps. To make these 
clear, begin with a sand modeling of a seacoast with its 
hinterland. Include the following features in your modeling: 
a bay, a peninsula, a cape, an island, mountains, valleys, a 
river, a lake, a town, and a railroad. After the model has 
been made and discussed, tell the story of James, who lives 
in the town represented here and who wishes to write to his 
cousin and tell him just where he lives and what his sur- 
roundings are. So he draws a map of the region, as a short- 
hand method of giving this information to his cousin. Select 
the symbols which James uses in his map. He will need 
symbols for mountain, lake, river, lowland, town, railroad, 
etc. Use the symbols generally employed in wall maps; 
that is, lines and colors. 
Now turn to the. clearest and simplest physical map of 
North America that you can find in your textbook. Discuss 
the meaning of the colors: blue, green, yellow, brown, red, 
black. Then ask the children to find a mountain range, a 
lake, a lowland, a river, a bay, a peninsula, a plateau, an 
even coast line, an irregular coast line, an island which is 
mountainous, etc. 
To give further reality to map symbols, select from your 
collection of pictures views of certain physical features. As 
you present each to the class, have them touch the proper 
symbol, on the textbook map, for river, mountains, wide 
plains, shore line, ete. After you are sure the connection 
between the picture and the symbol is made instantly, tell 
the children you wish them to be more exact in locating the 
proper symbol. For instance, if you show a picture of a 
winter scene on a river, should they point to a river in 
Mexico? If the picture shows a wide plain with great corn 
fields, would a plain in northern Canada be meant? etc. 
This work with the pictures may occupy several periods. 
It is exceedingly important, in the early stages of map 
reading, to see that each child is getting thought from the
-P-A-G-E-33
  
UNIT 9. MAP READING 27 
mapped page. If he is too conscious of the symbols (such as 
lines, colored areas, etc.), so that they become the end and 
aim of his map reading, turn again to the sand table, to 
pictures, and to real scenes around him. Keep him away 
from much use of wall maps or textbook maps, until you 
are sure he can come to the map with interpretation ideas 
instead of symbol ideas. He will soon catch the trick of 
seeing through the symbol to the thought behind the symbol, 
and that is real map reading. 
General suggestions. 
1. Try to free the child of the idea that a place looks like 
the map of the place. The earth does not look like a map 
at all. 
2. Keep the same directions on the map and on the sand 
table. Make all first maps on a horizontal surface. If 
possible, draw one map on the floor, to keep the right idea of 
direction. Later, hang the maps on the north wall and show 
that north is now the top of the map and south the bottom. 
East and west have not changed. Try to avoid giving the 
impression that north is up. 
3. Do not begin to develop map making until the child 
has in mind something to map. 
4. Introduce wall maps after most symbols are clearly 
understood. Present physical maps first. Avoid the over- 
crowded political map. 
5. Try to put imagination into map reading; to see 
mountains, prairies, busy city streets, etc. Test frequently 
in map reading by having some child describe an imaginary 
map journey. 
6. Point to places on the map which have been studied 
in home and world geography. 
7. Plan distance and size drills on wall maps. For each 
continent select a conspicuous unit by which estimates of 
size can be easily made. 
In judging distances, convenient round numbers should 
be used, as, for instance: 
Europe: Italian Peninsula, 850 miles long. Scandinavian 
Peninsula, 1000 miles long. Spain, 500 miles square.
-P-A-G-E-34
28 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
North America: Florida, 400 miles long. 
Suggested estimates required. If the Scandinavian 
Peninsula is about 1000 miles long, what is the entire length 
of Europe? the width? If Italy is about 850 miles long, 
how long is Great Britain? etc.

UNIT 1. INDIANS, AND HOW THEY LIVE 
Time required: 2 to 4 weeks 
General suggestions for the study of ahuman type. Work 
out the study so fully that the child has clear-cut mental 
pictures of each type of life. Many details must be presented 
to make permanent impressions. Select these details with 
care, making use of those which are most significant and 
omitting all which might prejudice the child against the 
people he is studying. These lessons must be largely con- 
versational. Try to develop in yourself the power to de- 
scribe. “ Pictures tell what is seen in these different lands; 
you must tell what is felt there.” 
An outline for the teacher. Appearance, dress, food, 
houses (of skin, bark, mud, etc.), customs, skill in hunting, 
games, arts and industries, family life, training of children, 
ideals of behavior; incidents in nomadic life of the prairie 
Indians. 
Interesting subjects. An Indian village. Indian blankets, 
pottery, bead work, etc. What the Indians have given to 
us (corn, pumpkins, etc.) Indian picture writing. How an 
Indian builds a boat. The medicine man. A war dance. 
Stories of Indian life in early days. 
Construction Work 
(a) Plan a sand-table scene of a small Indian village. It may include 
wigwams, a tiny canoe in the river, deer and buffalo hiding behind hills (of 
sand or rocks), small figures of Indians (cut from construction paper). 
Mark off little irregular spaces near the village for patches of corn and 
pumpkins. (b) Plan a simple Indian costume for use in dramatization in 
geography.

5. Trade. What do the people of the desert give us? 
What do we'send to them? How would a child of the desert 
be impressed if he were to visit your home state? 
Construction Work 
Begin construction work as soon as interest is aroused and there is some 
notion of what to construct and a desire to construct it. 
Make a desert scene on the sand table. Heap the sand in mounds, with | 
wavy indentations on them, to represent dunes. Use sharp-edged stones, 
massed with sand, to show the jagged line of the mountains in the back- 
ground. Line a tin cup with putty and pebbles, fill it with water, and set 
it down in the sand to represent a well in an oasis. Fringe gray-green con- 
struction paper to make the spreading top of the date palm and attach to 
the end of a stick. Then wrap the stick in raffia to show the brown bark. 
Cut from paper small figures of camels, horses, Arabs. A piece of brown 
cambric three inches square will do for the tent covering. Use small sticks 
for tent poles. Try to let the effect be one of immensity and loneliness. 
Combine with language work by making these geography studies material 
for oral and written language work.

UNIT 3. THE ESKIMO, AND LIFE IN THE 
NORTHLAND 
Time required: 2 to 4 weeks 
Greenland, the country of the Eskimo. Imagine a 
country almost entirely covered by an immense ice sheet, 
except for a narrow margin a few miles wide along the shore. 
Here are many deep, narrow bays, called fiords, with snow- 
covered mountains rising as steep cliffs on either side. 
Icebergs, broken off from the glaciers, and great ice floes 
float about in the clear, deep waters of the fiords and in the 
open seas beyond. 
In winter the snow covers everything. In summer the 
rocks are bare and gray, with occasional patches of fresh 
green moss. On sunny slopes there are many beautiful 
flowers — daisies, violets, poppies, dandelions, roses. The 
sun shines all the time in summer, even at midnight. It 
never rises high in the sky; at noon, it is no higher than our 
sun at schooltime on a summer morning. Is it as warm 
when the sun is low in the sky as when it is high? In winter 
the sun does not shine at all, but the stars are out all day 
long. 
The people. Appearance, dress, food, houses (winter 
and summer), arts (boat making), games and sports. 
Animal life. Polar bear, dog, reindeer (or caribou), musk 
ox, whale, seal, walrus, birds, fish. 
Plant life. Trees, shrubs, vines, mosses and lichens, 
flowers. 
Construction Work 
Winter scene. Cover the sand table with snow (cotton). Make an 
igloo, or snow house, of paper or clay. Make figures of reindeer, musk ox, 
polar bear, seal, and several Eskimos with dogs and sled. 
Summer scene. Model in sand some high mountains at the back of the 
sand table. Let these descend to a coastal plain with a deeply indented 
shore line. Let fiords run well back into the land. Cover all mountain 
slopes and a part of the plain with cotton for snow. Let one glacier extend 
to the sea at the head of the fiord. Near the shore, place a paper represen- 
tation of a summer tent or hut. Use the same figures of animals and Es- 
kimos as in the winter scene. Cut a long narrow boat from brown paper, 
83. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  34 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
put an Eskimo figure in it, and place it in the fiord. Make icebergs of 
bluish white paper, to stand out from the fiords. Bits of moss and bright- 
colored tissue paper will represent the mossy slopes dotted with gay flowers. 
Let the scene show that these Eskimos live from the sea.

sports and games, means of transportation, industries 
(haying, lumbering, butter and cheese making, manufacture 
of watches, cuckoo clocks, music boxes, toys, laces, milk 
chocolate, etc.). 
The country where the Swiss live. Point out Switzer- 
land on the globe. Beautiful scenery — mountains, valleys, 
passes, lakes, glaciers, rivers, waterfalls, alps. Distinguish 
between an alp and the Alps. Climate — winds, snowfall, 
temperatures. 
Animal life. Chamois, sheep, goats, cattle, hares, marmots, 
birds.

gomery: Arnold Von Winkelried. Byron: The Prisoner of 
Chillon and The Lion of Lucerne. Longfellow’s poem to 
Agassiz on his fiftieth birthday. Tennyson: The Bugle Call. 
Comparisons. What do the Swiss send to us? What do 
we send to them? How would a Swiss farm differ from a 
farm in your community? Name three things which you 
can do that the Swiss boy or girl cannot do. Name three 
things which the Swiss boy or girl can do in Switzerland 
that you cannot do. Suggest all the differences you can 
think of between living on a plain, as most of us do in our 
country, and living among high mountains, as the Swiss do. 
Construction Work 
Model in sand a scene in Switzerland. Make jagged, snow-covered 
peaks, with occasional small flat alps, or mountain meadows. Cover these 
alps with moss or grass. Have many levels to show the great irregularity 
of surface. Use blue construction paper to represent mountain lakes, and

a long, ragged strip of cotton to show a glacier descending into the valley. 
Represent a river as beginning where the glacier ends. Make a very small 
paper house (two inches square) with a red roof. Paste tiny gravel on the 
roof to represent the boulders used to keep the wind from blowing the 
roof away. Cut out very small figures of goats and cows. Put the goats 
on the highest meadows.

  UNIT 5. THE DUTCH, AND LIFE IN 
COASTAL LOWLANDS 
Time required: 2 to 4 weeks 
The country of the Dutch — Holland. Dikes, polders, 
dunes. Dikes are walls of earth built to keep the sea from 
coming over the low land. Often they are built out into 
the sea, till they enclose a strip of land covered by shallow 
water. Then the water is pumped off and a low flat stretch 
of land is uncovered. This is divided into fields, which are 
called polders. Windmills are kept pumping day and night 
to remove the water that collects in these low fields. 
The people. Appearance, dress, shoes, houses, furniture, 
food, customs, sports, arts. 
Industries. 
1. Dairying. Care of cattle. Butter and cheese making. 
Compare with methods used in your neighborhood. 
2. Flower-bulb raising. 
Means of transportation. Canals and canal boats. Dogs 
used to pull carts. : : 
Interesting topics. A leak in the dike. A Dutch windmill. 
Skating in Holland. Dutch cattle (Holstein). Canals as 
streets. Dutch cleanliness (“Old Dutch Cleanser”). A 
Dutch dairy barn. How wooden shoes are made. What 
would a boy or girl from Holland think of your home? 
What do the Dutch send to us? What do we send to them? 
Construction Work 
With sand and narrow strips of blue paper, represent the low polders 
and the canals. Show a little of the shore line and mold a dike along the 
shore, several inches higher than the polders behind it. Let the canals inter- 
sect at right angles, thus dividing the land into small square fields. From 
paper or clay, make windmills, bridges, black and white cows, people. 
The effect may be rather overcrowded, to give the impression of density of 
population.

UNIT 8. THE OCEAN 
Time required: 4 weeks 
Appearance. As the ocean is remote from many American 
children, it is necessary to make a special effort to stimulate 
imagination regarding its appearance. Points to stress: 
wideness, restlessness, changing colors, dashing of the waves 
on the shore. Contrast the ocean surface with that of the 
land —no hills, valleys, mountains, roads, or cities — just 
water. 
The children will be eager to consult their friends who have 
seen the ocean, and to secure personal descriptions from 
them. Pictures will help greatly, if they are supplemented 
by vividly worded interpretations. Ask the children to 
search everywhere among their books for description and 
narration about the sea. As short extracts in prose or 
verse are read to the children, ask them to jot down any 
phrases they think are particularly delightful. Some of 
these they may wish to use later in their talks to the class. 
Size. Estimated in terms of the number of days it takes 
to cross by any well-known route. Study names of oceans 
and comparative sizes. 
With a string, measure the width of the Atlantic and 
Pacific —on the globe. Ask the children to name any 
foreign port they know: then measure the water distance 
to that port from New York, or San Francisco. Give an 
opportunity for each child to mention persons he knows who 
have traveled on the ocean, to tell where they went, and to 
point out the route on the globe; and if possible, to mention 
the time it took the traveler to go from port to port. 
Movements. (Very general.) Wind waves, tides, cur- 
rents. Describe, but do not try to explain these movements. 
Note their effect on man. Tell some interesting incidents 
about the tide. 
Travel on the sea. (Tarr and McMurry: New Geography,

Sea.) 
4. Interesting sights. Passing steamers, icebergs, whales 
spouting, flying fish, sea gulls and other sea birds, 
distant islands, etc. 
5. Ports and harbors. What makes a harbor safe for 
large boats? (Deep water, protection from the wind, 
freedom from fog and ice, plenty of anchorage and 
wharfage room.) Show the need for a place for ships 
to tie wp, by comparing with the need for parking space 
in our towns and cities. 
Sea life. In what kind of waters found? How obtained? 
How used? Whale, seal, shark, cod, salmon, mackerel, 
oyster, herring, sponge, coral. (Select three or four for 
study.) 
The sea as a builder. Chalk, limestone, sandstone, etc. 
Construction Work 
Model in sand a shore line, with several shallow indentations and one 
deep bay. Use blue construction paper to represent the water. Here, 
represent a port with wharves (made of construction paper). On the wharves 
have small cards labeled with names of articles carried by different ships 
as cargo: cotton, tea, coffee, wheat, meats, cloth, coal, wool, chemicals and 
dyes, cabinet woods, fruits, etc. Make boats, islands, lighthouses, etc., 
from construction paper. Discuss the loading and unloading of ships, and
-P-A-G-E-50
  44 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
trace on the globe the probable journey of each ship after it is loaded. Do 
not hesitate to try to represent these features even though your first attempt 
does not satisfy you. Merely suggest the details, and let the child’s imagina- 
tion fill in the rest. 
Make a booklet called The Book of the Ocean in shape of shell, fish, boat, 
lighthouse, ete. Paste in pictures or make drawings illustrating the ocean 
and ocean life. The children should select a name for each picture that is 
used. Add children’s write-ups about travel on the sea.

  PART TWO 
UNIT STUDIES FOR INTERMEDIATE GRADES 
AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS 
A FOREWORD TO INTERMEDIATE AND 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS 
In each unit study in Part II (with the exception of those 
which introduce continent study), there are six divisions 
of the work which should be clearly understood by the 
teacher. They are explained as follows: 
1. Finding the starting point. This is an informal intro- 
ductory discussion. It is not a place for instruction, but 
it is a period of exploration. The teacher wishes to call up 
the children’s present knowledge about the unit which is 
to be studied. She knows that there are some interests in 
the daily lives of the children which would lead naturally . 
into the new field, and that it is a great waste in education 
if these interests are not used. She thinks over the chil- 
dren’s experiences (as she knows them) and formulates ques- 
tions or suggests topics which are to remind the children of 
' whatever they already know about the subject to be studied. 
If any one of her suggestions fails to bring a response, it is 
quietly dropped for the time being. If no answering thought 
is aroused, it is apparent that the children have no knowledge 
concerning the topic, and it should be reserved for study as 
new material. The teacher is on the alert to discover a 
new line of investigation and to follow it with enthusiasm. 
Seemingly trivial incidents, or items of personal experience, 
may prove to be just what she needs to arouse individual 
interests and to obtain a contribution from every member 
of the class. In this way the teacher finds the starting 
point. The outline of each unit suggests ways of con- 
ducting this exploration. 
If the teacher finds that the introductory discussion con- 
cerning a unit of study has proved unsatisfactory and that 
45
-P-A-G-E-52
  46 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
there is really very little in it upon which to build, she 
might plan to give a carefully prepared talk of five or ten 
minutes, stating some of the more striking and significant 
geographical “‘controls” of the area, and suggesting some of 
the human activities which result from them. This will 
help the children to find their own interest centers. 
2. Reading the map. In each unit study, a series of map 
facts is given. Most of these facts were actually obtained 
from children of the grades. They are listed in the study, 
not as facts to be presented to the children, but as a standard 
by which the teacher may judge the map-reading ability of 
her own group. 
Map reading is conducted as a laboratory exercise. 
With books open at the best physical and political maps of 
the area, the children are asked to say what those maps tell 
them. They are not questioned as to specific items on the 
map; that makes the child so conscious of single elements 
that he cannot get the larger thought which the map has to 
give him. To read a map well, the child must learn to 
look beyond the symbols to the thought. 
To stimulate map reading, the teacher might say: “The 
children of the sixth grade in a certain city found twenty 
good map facts about this unit. Look at your maps and 
list every map fact concerning the subject that you think 
will help us in getting a fair and true understanding of the 
people who live here. After you tell me your facts, I will 
let you compare your list with the one I have in hand.” 
In the intermediate grades, many children will see loca- 
tional facts only. These have their value, but the children 
should be encouraged to find the map facts that give infer- 
ences, or that state comparisons. As a rule, older children 
will draw inferences sooner and will generalize more freely 
than the younger pupils. The younger child stresses the 
personal and the specific. Out of three hundred map facts 
presented by fifth-grade children, seventy were facts of 
location, seventy were identifications of surface features, 
fifty-six were inferences or conjectures, and thirty-two were 
comparisons.
-P-A-G-E-53
  FOREWORD TO TEACHERS AT 
If children are permitted to read a map freely, and en- 
couraged to state their findings, they will soon pass from 
statements of obvious locational facts to statements of con- 
clusions derived from groups of facts. 
List map facts on the blackboard as they are offered, 
using the childlike and naive expressions in which they are 
given. This translates the map into child language and 
gives it a real meaning. Explain to the children that these 
map facts will help us later, when we come to work out 
problems. Maps will give a wealth of information, if they 
are used. Read them freely; first, for the general thought; 
secondly, for specific information. 
8. Discovering interest centers. An interest center is 
some definite thing one wishes to know about an area, some- 
thing about which one has a lively curiosity. It may be a 
problem, although no single problem can center all the 
interests of a large area. An interest center originates with 
the child and is expressed in his own words. After the 
introductory discussion of a unit, and after the map reading, 
most children are ready to tell what they would like to know, 
or to do, with regard to the study. 
Some children are thing thinkers, and their interest will 
naturally turn to specific things — Ford cars, the locks of a 
canal, etc. Others are idea thinkers and are quick to find 
problems which call for investigation. In each unit study 
encourage class work and individual work in both types of 
interest centers. 
Many of the interest centers listed in these studies are in 
the exact words in which children expressed them. Like 
the map facts, they embody suggestions for various lines 
of work. 
4. Working out some of the problems. Some interest 
centers become true problems which all the members of the 
class may study profitably. Encourage the class to help 
you outline the problem. Talk over what facts are needed 
to help solve the problem. The children should read widely 
and discuss freely what they find. They will wish to make 
» laps and graphs, and to explain these to the group. Fre-  
-P-A-G-E-54
48 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
quent summaries of the different parts of the problem are 
also needed. These should be required in both the oral 
and the written form. 
5. Selecting tool facts for drill. After several interest 
centers have been dealt with and the class has assimilated 
much information about the unit, select a few facts which 
are worth remembering, because they will afford a founda- 
tion for thought. Then drill on such facts as one would 
drill on the words in a spelling lesson. 
6. Planning illustrative activities. During the course of 
a study, opportunities for dramatizations, for construction 
work, for debates, talks, exhibits, etc., will arise. Many 
suggestions for these activities are offered for each unit. 
Select those which seem to fit in naturally with your study, 
introducing them whenever they belong in the work, and 
as often as occasion may require.

CONTINENT STUDY 
UNIT 1. SEEING NORTH AMERICA AS A 
WHOLE 
Time required: 2 to 3 weeks 
North America is the home of three great nations. Let 
us see what advantages it offers to their people. 
Location. Does the location of the continent help to 
tell us why these nations are so great? If North America 
were where Africa is, would these nations be so great? 
If the whole continent were about where Greenland is, 
would these nations have the same opportunity? where 
Australia is? Why did not South America produce a nation 
as great as ours? With globe in hand, or with hemisphere 
maps, describe as well as you can just where North America 
is; then tell what points of its location are favorable, and 
what are unfavorable. 
Most children readily mention such points as these: 
North America is all north of the equator. 
Only its narrowest part lies in the torrid zone. 
Its widest part is in the temperate zone. 
It has few near neighbors. In the Eastern Hemisphere 
there are three continents very close together. 
Greenland is a close neighbor, but it is so far north 
that I think it would not be an important neighbor. 
6. The West Indies are island neighbors. I wonder if 
they are good neighbors for a big continent that is 
largely in the temperate zone. 
7. North America goes farther west than South 
America. 
Such simple map reading shows the need for a way of 
locating continents more definitely. This brings up the 
question: How can we locate North America more definitely? 
Explain that the measurement of latitude and longitude is 
a device to tell where places are on the globe.

1. Suggested methods. On a plain slated globe, or on 
any smooth ball, draw the equator and parallels 10 degrees 
apart (noting the division of circles into degrees). Name 
circles for different children. Teach the word latitude 
as meaning distance north or south of the equator. Let each 
child give the latitude of his parallel. Several children may 
have the same parallel. Then are they necessarily in the 
same place? How describe where they are? Draw a north- 
south line called the prime meridian; add other meridians, 
and teach the word longitude as distance east or west of the 
prime meridian. Drill in telling the longitude of given 
meridians; then drill in telling the latitude and longitude 
of points of intersection of parallels and meridians. 
From the globe showing the continents, estimate the 
latitude and longitude (a) of North America, (b) of the 
other continents. Note that the parallels are not all the 
same length on the globe, but that they are shorter toward 
the poles. Consequently degrees of longitude are not all 
the same length.

2. Additional drill questions on the globe. What is the 
latitude of the North Pole? the equator? Through what 
continents does the equator pass? the prime meridian? 
What is the longitude of a place on the globe opposite the 
prime meridian? What is the greatest longitude a place 
can have? the greatest latitude? How many degrees wide 
is North America at the 40th parallel? Then how many 
miles wide? Find widths of other continents at given 
parallels. Point to a place on the globe, latitude 40 de- 
grees north, longitude 90 degrees west, etc. Continue 
such drills at frequent intervals till the child thinks latitude 
and longitude easily.

Outline. It will help us to see the continent of North 
America as a whole, if we study its form and its coast lines 
and name its coastal features. 
Show form of continent, first, on the globe, then, on the 
flat map of the textbook. Note parallels and meridians here. 
Directions for sketching the map of North America: 
Place on the board and on paper lines to represent Tropic 
of Cancer, the Arctic Circle, the meridians of 60 degrees west 
and 120 degrees west. These lines are to be in proper space 
relations to the same lines in the map of the geography 
textbook. With these as guide lines, sketch in an outline of 
North America. 
Outline the continent with chalk on the sand table, and 
cover evenly with sand. Drill on the names and location 
of the following projections and indentations: 
Projections. Alaska, Bothnia, Labrador, Nova Scotia, 
Florida, Yucatan, Lower California. 
Indentations. Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay, Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, Gulf of Mexico, 
Gulf of California, Puget Sound, San Francisco Bay, Bering 
Sea. 
As you model, call attention to the different types of 
coast lines, such as the rocky, fiorded coast of southern 
Alaska; the low, shelving, sandy shore of the Carolinas; the 
steep, wall-like coasts of part of California, etc. 
Surface. How do the surface features and their arrange- 
ment help to make North America the home of a great 
nation? 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
    52 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
On the level sand map build in and name, with brief de- 
scription of each, the following physical features: Coast 
Ranges, Sierra Nevadas, Cascades, Great Valley of Cali- 
fornia, Sierra Madres, the Great Basin, the Rocky Moun- 
tains and plateaus, the Appalachian Mountains, the Great 
Central Plain, the Black Hills, the Ozarks, the Laurentian 
Highland, the Arctic plain. Have the children locate all 
the surface features you have modeled on their sketch maps 
of the continent. For excellent physical map as a guide for 
modeling, see Atwood: New Geography, page 124; Mc- 
Murry and Parkins: Elementary Geography, page 59; Smith: 
Human Geography, Book I, pages 34, 35. 
Nore. Do not hesitate to try the sand modeling, as it will prove very 
helpful in continent study. With the maps of the textbooks before them, 
the children suggest where the various highlands are and the teacher models 
rapidly with the moist sand. Use bits of cotton to show the snow on the 
lofty Sierra Nevadas, or to represent the glaciers which come down to the 
shore in southern Alaska. Describe in definite terms each feature modeled 
till a given plain or mountain system takes on an individuality of its own. 
Every teacher of geography should develop her vocabulary for describing 
physical features. Such phrases as jagged peaks, wooded slopes, rounded 
summits, snow-covered peaks help in the picture-forming process which is 
needed. 
After the continent as a whole is modeled and described, let the children 
model and describe selected features. Imaginary automobile trips across 
the continent in various directions will help to give reality to this study. 
Drainage. If the sand modeling is fairly accurate, it 
will be apparent which way water will run on such a surface. 
Have the pupils infer where there would probably be rivers, 
then consult maps to see if they are right. Represent on 
the sand map the following: Great Lakes, Mississippi River, 
Missouri River, Platte River, Ohio River, Colorado River, 
Columbia River, St. Lawrence River, Rio Grande, Mac- 
kenzie River, Yukon River. (Use common wrapping string, 
colored with blue chalk, to represent rivers.) Describe rivers 
as tidal, navigable, deep, shallow, clogged with sand bars, 
clear, rock-bottomed, muddy, having rapids and falls, delta- 
building, ete. A river is usually tidal if it empties into a 
sea or gulf which has a wide entrance to the ocean. Why?
-P-A-G-E-59
  
UNIT 1. SEEING NORTH AMERICA AS A WHOLE 53 
Then is the Mississippi tidal? the St. Lawrence? Would a 
tidal river be likely to build a large delta? 
With narrow strips of colored paper represent the 30th, 
40th, 50th, and 60th parallels, and the 75th, 90th, 100th, 
and 120th meridians on the sand map. Drill in estimating 
latitude and longitude of all features represented on the 
map. Then remove strips and practice in judging latitude 
and longitude without parallels or meridians marked. 
Verify, by the maps in your textbooks.

Climate. Does the climate help to make North America 
the home of a great nation? 
Nors. This study should be made very simple and be given without 
much explanation. It is necessary to teach many facts, but they should 
be related facts, and should be humanized as much as possible. 
1. Heat and cold. All places on the earth do not receive 
the same amount of heat from the sun. Nearer the equator, 
where the sun is almost overhead at noon, the rays shine 
more directly; therefore it is warmer there. The Tropic 
of Cancer is a line on the globe which shows how far 
north of the equator the sun’s rays ever fall vertically. Is
-P-A-G-E-60
    54 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
the sun ever directly over our heads in our home state? 
in Lower California? Which place would you expect to be 
the warmer? 
Nore. Hold some object, as a pencil, over the Tropic of Cancer, which 
is marked on the sand map. Call this object the sun. Show how rays from 
the sun in June will fall vertically upon the Tropic of Cancer, but will be 
very much more slanting in New York. Then, which place will probably 
be the warmer? Where, in North America, will the most slanting rays 
fall? Then, where will we expect the greatest cold? It is much colder in 
winter than in summer in New York. What must be one reason for this? 
Hold the pencil south of the tropic, and show how the sun’s rays are now 
more slanting in New York than they were before. We have noticed that 
winter days are much shorter than summer days. Would this also help 
to explain why winter is cold? Further explanation of the change of 
seasons should be left till the seventh grade. (Atwood: New Geography, 
page 270.) 
2. Winds. Although the sun gives light and heat to the 
earth, there are many things which affect the distribution 
of this heat. The most important of these is wind. 
From about the 30th parallel of the northern hemisphere 
to the equator, the winds blow steadily from the northeast. 
They are called trade winds. Why? From the 30th parallel, 
to the north, the winds blow from the west or southwest. 
These are called prevailing westerlies. Why? ‘These wester- 
lies are not so steady as the trades, but change their direction 
frequently. 
On the sketch maps of North America, and on the sand 
map, locate the 30th parallel; then arrange small paper 
arrows to show the directions of the trades and the westerlies. 
8. Drill questions. What is the direction of the prevailing 
wind in southern Mexico? Lower California? Hudson 
Bay? around the Great Lakes? The wind at Puget Sound 
has been blowing over what? Ocean water is cooler than 
the land in summer, and warmer than the land in winter. 
Then, in summer, what effect would the wind have on the 
temperature at Puget Sound? in winter? The side of a 
highland to which the wind blows first is called the windward 
side. The other side is the leeward. Which is the windward 
side of the Sierra Madres? the Cascades? the Appalachians? 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
       UNIT 1. SEEING NORTH AMERICA AS A WHOLE 55 
  Is the Great Basin on the windward or the leeward side of 
the Sierra Nevadas? 
Make an isotherm or temperature map, and draw (in red) 
the July isotherm of 68 degrees and (in blue) the January 
isotherm of 32 degrees. (Frye: New Geography, page 94.) 
4. Rainfall. Review unit study on Air and recall the 
following principles: rising air soon cools; cooling air gives 
up its load of water; settling air becomes warm; warming 
air takes up water. 
Does the air that blows over Puget Sound carry much 
water? As it moves eastward, over what mountains does 
it pass? Then, what change occurs in its temperature? 
What effect will this have on its load of water? On which 
side of the mountains would most of this water fall? As the 
air descends the Cascades, would there be much rain? Why? 
Would you expect heavy rainfall in the Great Basin? in the 
Great Valley of California? in the Great Central Plain? 
Judge, on the map, and on the sand map, where there would 
be abundant rain; scanty rain. Turn to rainfall map to 
verify your conclusions. Make rainfall map, using shading 
or coloring to represent the different amounts. (Brigham 
and McFarlane: Essentials of Geography, First Book, page 
76. Atwood: New Geography, page 124. McMurry and 
Parkins: Elementary Geography, page 151.) If the high 
mountains were in the East, instead of the West, what effect 
would this have on the rainfall? On the whole, what 
part of North America seems to have the most favorable 
climate, judging by temperature and rainfall? Is the 
greatest nation on the continent in that part? 
5. Plant and animal life. The temperature and the 
rainfall of a place help to determine the kinds of plants and 
animals that are found there. Mention a plant that will 
grow where it is hot and dry; where it is hot and rainy; 
where it is cold. What does corn need? cotton? wheat? 
oranges? dates? What conditions of temperature or rainfall 
are best suited to the seal, ostrich, sheep, camel, etc.? 
From maps showing surface, temperature, and rainfall, infer 
the vegetation to be expected in different parts of North    
  
-P-A-G-E-62
  56 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
America. Consult vegetation and animal maps to verify 
your conclusions. (Frye: New Geography, pages 79-80.) 
Have children contribute pictures of plants and animals. 
These may be grouped on the sand map in their proper 
places.

  UNIT 2. THE MID-WEST, OR THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS OF THE UNITED STATES 
Time required: 4 to 5 weeks 
Finding the starting point. The term Central Plains is so 
indefinite that it must first be made clear before there is any 
attempt to gather together the threads of knowledge the 
child already has regarding particular places within the 
area. 
Defining the term. 
What is a plain? What does it look like? Is it all entirely 
flat? What often grows on plains? Why? 
What is a central plain? How does it differ from a coastal 
plain? Where is our central plain? our coastal plain? (See 
physical map of the United States.) 
Do continents other than ours have central plains? 
(See relief maps.) Is a big plain in the middle of a continent 
a good thing? If a continent has a lowland in the center and 
highlands on the edges, it is something like a plate. Some 
continents are like a plate turned upside down, high in the 
center and low on the edges. Africa is like that. Is Europe? 
Is Australia? Is Asia? What is the country of Mexico 
like? 
Nors. The bounds of our Central Plains. These are very technical, if 
given accurately. They might be simplified for the children by using state 
boundaries only. The textbooks use the term The North Central States. 
Note, however, that eastern Ohio and Kentucky and southern Missouri 
are not real plains, but dissected plateaus. 
The three kinds of plains which make up the Central 
Plains should be described and located as follows: 
(a) Lake plains. A narrow hem around the Great Lakes 
formerly covered by lake water. Very flat; rich, fine-grained 
soils. Easy to cultivate, a good place for railroads, etc. 
The Red River Valley also belongs to this lake-plain area. 
In that valley there once was a lake larger than all the 
Great Lakes. It dried up and left its flat bed for farm 
land. 
57
-P-A-G-E-64
  58 UNIT STUDIES IN -GEOGRAPHY 
(b) Prairie plains. Not so flat as lake plains. Soil not 
usually so fine-grained. This plain can grow corn, small 
grain, and grass. A prairie does not have great forests 
growing on it. There are some trees, but they are usually 
near the streams, unless they have been planted elsewhere 
by man. 
(c) High plains. Not enough rain to insure crops. 
What people on the plains do for a living. A study of the 
illustrations in the textbooks will help the child to see that 
life on the plains is not a one-interest life, but that there are 
many kinds of work to be done. Divide the class into four 
groups, each group to select from the textbook and other 
reference books the pictures belonging to the subject assigned 
tothem. The subjects for these sets of pictures are (a) farm 
scenes, (b) mining scenes, (c) factory scenes, (d) travel 
scenes (including pictures of canals, roads, boats, etc.). 
Each group plans for brief talks to show the variety of work 
found in each set of pictures. A secretary lists the various 
employments as they are interpreted from the pictures. 
Other pictures of scenes in the Central Plains may be intro- 
duced to show that there are many kinds of places as well 
as many kinds of work here. 
Test the children’s knowledge of various places in the 
Mid-West. An informal discussion of the following topics 
may discover in the child’s everyday life some interest 
which he already has in the Central Plains: 
(a) Places in the Mid-West where the children have been. 
(6) Places where friends or relatives live or have visited. 
(c) Things we have in our homes which were made in the 
Mid-West (automobiles, furniture, shoes, breakfast foods, 
aprons, overalls, etc.). Each child must be sure he knows 
just where each article was made before he suggests it. 
Then he may step to the wall map and point out the location. 
Reading the map. The following are typical map facts 
which the children may be led to discover for themselves, if 
they are given a chance to tell what they can find on the 
map. Maps required: physical, political, railroad, popula- 
tion, rainfall, corn, wheat.

1. The Central Plains lie between the Eastern highland 
and the Rocky Mountains. 
2. They do not go so far south as the Gulf of Mexico, 
because the Ozark Mountains stop them. 
3. They have very long rivers, the longest in the United 
States. 
4. The Great Lakes seem to stop the Central Plains from 
going farther northeast. 
5. Almost all the rivers of the Plains flow into the Missis- 
sippi, but the Red River of the North goes the other 
way. 
6. There are many more people in the eastern part of 
the Central Plains than in the western part. 
7. The Black Hills make an uneven place on the Plains. 
8. The states in the western part of the Plains are larger 
than those in the eastern part. 
9. The Central states make up almost one fourth of the 
whole United States. I wonder if one fourth of the people 
of the country live here. 
10. I think there would be many railroads in the Central 
Plains because it would be so easy to build the track on such 
broad plains. 
Choosing some interest centers. An interest center is 
some definite thing one wishes to know about an area; some- 
thing about which one has a lively curiosity. It may be a 
problem, although no single problem can center all the in- 
terests of an area so large as this. It originates with the 
child and is expressed in his own words. It may be a ques- 
tion, a statement of a desire to find out something or to draw 
a comparison. It says what the child would like to do or 
to know. 
The following are typical of the child’s interest centers 
as he states them himself: 
1. I have always wanted to go to Chicago to see what 
it is like. 
2. Henry Ford lives in Detroit. I should like to know 
about his big factories there. 
3. In North Dakota, they use big gang plows drawn by
-P-A-G-E-66
60 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
  tractors to get the ground ready for the wheat. I should 
like to know more about that. 
4. The International Harvester Company is in Chicago. 
They sell farm implements all over the world. I should like 
to study about that. 
5. The big stockyards in Kansas City are an interesting 
place. 
6. I should like to find out more about sugar-beet 
growing. 
7. A trip on the Great Lakes would be a splendid way to 
spend a vacation. I should like to plan such a trip. 
8. I have always wanted to know how the locks in a 
big canal are worked. The Soo Canal would be an interest- 
ing study. 
9. I should like to spend a summer on a big cattle 
ranch. 
10. Why are there so many big creameries and dairies 
in the Central Plains? 
11. I want to find out more about how corn is raised. 
12. If the Central Plains raise wheat and corn and sugar 
beets and potatoes and meat, it looks as if this region must 
raise most of the really important food we have on our 
tables. Does it raise more than other sections of the coun- 
try? How much of the food supply of the whole country 
does it furnish? 
13. Why are there so many things manufactured in the 
Central Plains? 
14. Why are there so many big cities around the Great 
Lakes? : 
15. Why is there so much more rain in the eastern part 
of the Central Plains than in the western part? 
16. I should like to find out about the great power dam 
at Keokuk. 
Gathering data and grouping results around selected 
interest centers. Two interest centers which seem to be 
adapted to children of these grades, and which call for an 
investigation of the more essential characteristics of the 
Central Plains, are:
-P-A-G-E-67
  UNIT 2. THE MID-WEST 61 
1. How do the Central Plains help to feed the whole 
country? 
2. Why are so many automobiles made in the Central 
Plains? 
These have therefore been chosen for outlining in this 
study. The teacher should feel entirely free to use any other 
interest centers which appeal more to her children. One or 
two problems of this kind, however, should be worked out 
by the entire class in committee of the whole. The other 
interest centers may then be assigned to smaller groups or to 
individuals. 
How do the Central Plains help to feed the whole country? 
1. What food do the Central Plains furnish? (Wheat, 
corn, sugar beets, potatoes, meat, fruit.) From maps, locate 
the parts of the Central Plains where each is raised in 
abundance. 
2. Some figure facts will help us to understand just how 
much food is produced here as compared with the rest of the 
country. These facts are from Dryer: Elementary Eco- 
nomic Geography, page 397.

Make a simple graph, showing how much of these funda- 
mental foods comes from the Central Plains. A series of 
lines arranged on a flagstaff, the different lengths represent-
-P-A-G-E-68
  62 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
ing the different per cents, make an easy form for graphing. 
If the proportions are quite exact, this becomes an excellent 
problem in arithmetic. 
There is an interesting table of statistics on page 260 in 
the first book of the Brigham and McFarlane geographies. 
From this, pick out the states of the Central Plains which 
lead in the crops listed. 
8. Make maps showing the wheat, corn, live stock, and 
sugar areas of the United States. An excellent series of 
outline maps, containing full directions for children’s work, 
is published by the Dobson Evans Company, Columbus, 
Ohio. 
4. The corn belt. Why do the Central Plains raise 
nearly three fourths of all the corn of the United States? 
(Smith: Human Geography, Book I, pages 52-59. Allen: 
Industrial Studies: The United States, Chapter 10.) What 
is corn used for? Why does it pay the farmer to raise it? 
What kind of soil is good for corn growing? 
What weather is best suited to corn? See isotherm map 
to locate the July temperature belt of 70 to 80 degrees. 
What summer temperature is best for corn? (See rainfall 
map.) What rainfall is best suited to corn? Should the 
heaviest rains come in the early summer or the late summer? 
How long should the growing season be? Does frost, late 
in the fall, injure corn? Are cool summer nights favorable 
to corn? (Recall that corn is really a tropical plant and 
needs plenty of heat to make it grow well.) Does the corn 
stalk show by its structure that it needs plenty of moisture 
to make it grow? (Recall the desert plants, with their small 
leaves and their woody stalks.) The corn plant seems to be 
made so that it requires much water. Note the line of 
20-inch rainfall. Then turn to the map of corn. Does the 
area of heaviest corn production extend much beyond that 
line? 
Find reasons why the eastern end of the Central Plains 
has heavier rain than the western. What rainfall has 
Omaha? (Discuss the south and southeast winds which 
bring rains from the Gulf of Mexico.)
-P-A-G-E-69
UNIT 2. THE MID-WEST 63 
What kind of surface should the land have to be favorable 
for corn growing? 
(a) Corn requires much room. It must be cultivated 
often to keep down the weeds. There is need for 
wide areas of level land in order to use modern 
machinery. 
(6) Steep slopes wash badly, and the soil becomes too 
thin. High altitudes are too cold at night for corn. 
(c) Although corn is grown almost everywhere in the 
cotton belt, and is often found in the Appalachian 
and Ozark areas, it does not produce the big ears 
that are found in the corn belt. 
(d) How does the farmer dispose of his corn? (Stored in 
corncribs or silos; fed to hogs, cattle.) Why does 
not the farmer ship out his corn, as he does his 
wheat? Is corn easily stored? How long can the 
farmer keep corn safely? Why do the more pros- 
perous farmers in the corn belt feed most of their 
corn to stock? 
5. The wheat belt. Why do the Central Plains raise 
nearly three fourths of the wheat of the United States? 
(Smith: Human Geography, Book I, pages 59-65. Frye: 
New Geography, pages 100-101. Allen: Industrial Studies: 
The United States, Chapter 9.) What are the uses of wheat? 
Why does it pay a farmer to raise wheat? Tell what wheat 
fields are like as to size, surface, nature of soils, etc. What 
weather is best suited to wheat growing? Turn to wheat 
map, then to the temperature map, and discover what 
July temperatures are found in the wheat area of the Central 
Plains. In the same way, study the rainfall maps with 
reference to the wheat areas. Locate the Red River Valley 
and find its rainfall. 
Should the rains be abundant during the early growing 
period of the wheat or during the ripening period? What 
is true of winter wheat? Which ripens earlier, wheat planted 
in the fall or in the spring? The wheat that ripens earlier 
may escape some dangers, such as insects and disease. 
What kind of wheat is grown in the Red River Valley?
-P-A-G-E-70
  64 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
Is more spring wheat than winter wheat grown in 
Kansas? 
Turn to the population map to see the density of popula- 
tion in the wheat areas. What is it in the Red River Valley? 
Then would there be any difficulty about getting labor for 
the big wheat ranches? How much hand labor is required 
for wheat? What machinery is used? Is the same amount 
of labor required during the entire season? Are extra 
laborers at hand when their work is needed? Does wheat 
require as many laborers as corn? as cotton? as sugar 
beets? 
Find out how the wheat farmer disposes of his wheat 
after it is threshed. To whom does he sell it? Where is it 
shipped? What wheat areas could ship wheat by water? 
Trace the railroad lines over which much wheat is shipped 
from Kansas or North Dakota. 
Make a list of cities and towns that have flour mills. 
Locate on the wheat map the principal milling centers. Find 
three reasons why it pays to make flour at these places. 
Write a few paragraphs telling why the Central Plains 
produce so much corn and wheat. 
6. Meat. Our graph shows that nearly three fourths 
of all the meat produced in the United States comes from 
the Central Plains. What are some reasons for this? Are 
more hogs raised in the corn belt than in the wheat belt? 
Where does the corn-belt farmer get his feeder cattle? 
Why does it pay better to ship feeder cattle into the corn 
belt than to ship corn for feed to the Western cattle? What 
other feed besides corn is used for fattening stock? 
Where are the big packing houses? Find some reasons 
why Chicago has the largest packing plant in the United 
States. Why is Omaha a good place for stockyards? Kan- 
sas City? 
Why are so many automobiles made in the Central Plains? 
(Frye: New Geography, pages 137-141. Smith: Human 
Geography, Book I, pages 71-81. McMurry and Parkins, 
Elementary Geography, pages 84-90. Journal of Geography, 
April, 1923. Scientific American, 1919, Vol. 121, page 511.)

UNIT 2. THE MID-WEST 65 
1. Three out of every four farmers in Nebraska own auto- 
mobiles. Many have trucks and tractors. In Iowa, too, 
the number of automobiles is very large. Why do farming 
people buy so many automobiles?» Do they buy more cars 
than workers in factories or in big stores? Why would 
Iowans buy more automobiles than the people of Colorado, 
for instance? 
2. Compile a list of all the makes of cars you know, and 
after each place the name of the city where it is manufac- 
tured. You can get this information from advertisements, 
from garage men, and from car owners. 
3. Trace a map showing the state boundaries of the 
Central Plains, and locate with a cross the places on your 
list. What two places lead in number of automobiles manu- 
factured? 
4. What raw materials are needed to make automo- 
biles? 
(a) Iron. Where are the iron-ore fields? How is the 
ore mined? How is it loaded and carried to the Lake 
Superior ports? How is it loaded on the boats? 
What kind of boats carry the ore to the iron manu- 
facturing cities? Trace the route from Duluth to 
Detroit; to Gary; to Cleveland. (McMurry and 
Parkins: Elementary Geography, pages 85-90.) 
(b) Wood. (Frye: New Geography, pages 102-103. 
Smith: Human Geography, Book I, pages 71-75. 
MeMurry and Parkins: Elementary Geography, pages 
86, 115-116.) What parts of an automobile are made 
of wood? What kind of wood is used? Where did it 
grow? 
(c) Copper. For what used? Where obtained? 
(d) Rubber. The city of Akron, Ohio, makes more tires 
than any other city in the world. Where does the 
raw rubber come from? Why does it pay to ship it 
from southeastern Asia to the interior of the United 
States to be manufactured? 
5. What power is used to run the machinery in a big 
automobile factory? (See coal map.) How far are Detroit
-P-A-G-E-72
  66 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
and Cleveland from coal? Would coal cost as much in 
Detroit as it does in Des Moines? Coal is needed to smelt 
the iron ore in the great blast furnaces. It is usually made 
into coke before it is put into the furnace with the ore. 
Why? What is the iron called when it comes out of the 
furnace? Why does not Fargo, North Dakota, have great 
blast furnaces and automobile factories? 
6. How are automobiles shipped out to the dealers in 
the different parts of the country? Do some go by water? 
What railroad lines bring cars to your home town? Are 
there many railroads in the part of the Central Plains where 
most of the automobiles are made? Are any of these auto- 
mobiles shipped to foreign countries? In what section of 
the United States is there the greatest demand? Why? 
7. List all the reasons you can find why so many auto- 
mobiles are made in or near Detroit. 
Some significant facts for drill. 
1. Name and location of all the states in the Mid-West. 
2. Area of the Mid-West. (About one fourth of the 
United States.) 
8. Population of the Mid-West. (About one third of the 
United States.) 
4. Approximate per cent of total production of the 
United States, in Central Plains, of corn, wheat, meat, 
potatoes. 
5. Exact location of ten or twelve cities, the list to be 
made by the class. 
6. Names of the Great Lakes and their connecting 
links. 
7. Location of (a) Lake Superior iron-ore field; (6) three 
large coal fields in or near the Central Plains. 
8. Location of two forest areas in or near the Mid-West. 
9. Name and be able to trace two or three important 
railroad lines in the Mid-West. 
10. Trace the line of 20-inch rainfall. 
11. Trace the outline of the corn belt. 
12. Trace the outlines of two important wheat areas in 
the Central Plains. 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  
UNIT 2. THE MID-WEST 67 
Some suggestions for children’s activities. 
1. Model the Central Plains in sand. Locate the Great 
Lakes, the Ozark Mountains, the Black Hills, the Missis- 
sippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Red rivers. Use some symbol to 
locate the coal fields and the Lake Superior iron-ore fields. 
2. Have groups of children dramatize selected events in 
the life of the Central Plains. The children should choose the 
event they wish to present and plan the simple costumes 
and action needed. The following jis a list which may 
be helpful: 
(a) A scene in a Minneapolis flour mill. 
(b) A scene in a Minnesota iron-ore district. 
(c) Buying feeder cattle at the stockyards for a farmer 
in the corn belt. 
(d) Scene at a large elevator in the wheat belt. 
(e) An International Harvester dealer tries to sell farm 
implements: (a) to a sugar-beet farmer near Scotts- 
bluffs, Nebraska; (6) to a corn-belt farmer near 
Springfield, Illinois; (c) to a wheat farmer in the 
Red River Valley. 
(f) A group of capitalists discuss Topeka as a place to 
set up an automobile factory. 
8. Write to the International Harvester Company, of 
Chicago, telling them who you are, where you live, what 
you are studying in school, and ask for all the free adver- 
tising material they can send you. 
4, Write to the Moline Plow Company, of Moline, 
Illinois, asking for free advertising material from their 
great plant. 
5. Write to some automobile manufacturer, asking for 
information as to where he gets the coal, or the iron, or the 
wood for his factory. 
6. Children give talks on selected subjects, such as 
(a) my visit to Chicago, (b) a visit to the stockyards, 
(c) how sugar beets are raised, (d) a trip on the Great 
Lakes, (e) how a lock canal works, (f) an automobile trip 
over the Central Plains. 
7. An exhibit of manufactures of the Central Plains. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  
68 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
A committee collects articles, pictures, advertisements, etc., 
and arranges them for display, each exhibitor being re- 
sponsible for some explanation of the article he furnishes. 
8. Trace one or two of the automobile highways that 
cross the Central Plains, and discuss the scenes along the 
route.

  UNIT 3. THE WESTERN STATES 
Time required: 4 to 5 weeks 
Finding the starting point. The following topics may 
serve to introduce the study and enable the teacher to 
discover, in the child’s everyday experiences, some interests 
which could be used as a starting point: 
1. Places in the Western states where the children have 
been. 
2. Places where their friends or relatives live. 
8. Interesting places the children would like to see, and 
why. 
4. Things we have in our homes which came from the 
Western states: oranges, lemons, raisins, prunes, other 
dried or canned fruits, olives, Navajo Indian blankets, 
Mexican and Indian pottery, cedar shingles on our houses, 
other kinds of wood, canned salmon, articles made of silver 
or copper, borax, wool, the mercury in our thermometers, etc. 
5. Interesting Western people: Buffalo Bill, Roosevelt 
as a cowboy, Luther Burbank, John Muir. 
6. The making of moving pictures in California. 
7. Stories of the gold seekers of 749. 
A relative importance test. Aim: To aid the teacher in 
discovering the child’s judgment of values, before the study 
of the area is made; at the close of the study, she will then 
be able to tell how far his opinions have been modified. 
All of the following statements are true, but some are more 
important than others. Divide them in two groups accord- 
ing to their importance. Number the statements in each 
group in order of their worth. 
1. Charlie Chaplin lives in California. 
2. The Sierra Nevadas are the highest mountains in the 
United States. 
8. More than half of the copper of the United States 
comes from the Western states. 
4. Many Japanese wish to come to the Batata states to 
make homes for themselves.

5. The sheep herder in Wyoming has a lonely life. 
6. Colorado and California produce most of the gold in 
our country. 
7. The Grand Canyon of Arizona has rock layers of 
many colors. 
8. Seattle and Portland furnish much lumber to the 
dealers of the United States. 
9. Pike’s Peak always has snow on its summit. 
10. All the boundary lines of Colorado are straight lines. 
11. Some of the bears in Yellowstone Park are so tame 
that they come up to the hotels and camping places and 
take meat out of the garbage cans. 
Reading the map. The following are typical of the map 
facts which children may be led to discover for themselves. 
Maps required: physical, political, population, forest, coal, 
railroad. 
1. This section of states is more than one third of the 
whole country. I wonder if it has one third of the population. 
2. The states in the group are all large. There is not a 
state east of the Mississippi River so large as any one of 
these. 
8. Many of the state boundaries are straight lines. 
4. Many rivers start in Colorado and Wyoming, flowing 
in different directions from that center. 
5. Six of the states of this group touch foreign countries. 
6. The Rocky Mountains bulge the farthest eastward 
in Colorado. They are the highest there, too. 
7. There is a chain of valleys along the Pacific slope. 
The largest is the Great Valley of California. I should 
expect these valleys to be good farming land. 
8. The Columbia River cuts right through the Cascades. 
9. I should not expect many of the rivers in this section 
to be navigable, because they nearly all seem to cut through 
the mountains. They will probably be good for water 
power. 
10. The Coast Ranges break down in one place, so 
making the Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay. 
11. Puget Sound is like a great bite out of the coast of
-P-A-G-E-77
    
UNIT 3. THE WESTERN STATES Tr 
Washington. It has long, narrow; irregular bays extending 
into the land. I should think there would be many good 
harbors here. 
12. The land is much more level back of the Cascades 
(east) than it is back of the Sierra Nevadas. 
13. The state of Nevada has very few rivers. Those 
that are there seem to start, then disappear. They do not 
get out to the sea. 
14. I do not believe there would be much farming land 
in some of these states. 
15. The mountains here are much wider and higher than 
those of the Eastern highland. 
Choosing some interest centers. An interest center is 
some definite thing one wishes to know about an area, 
something about which one has a lively curiosity. It may 
be a problem, although no single problem can center all the 
interests of an area so complex as this. It originates with 
the child and is expressed in his own words. It may be a 
question or a statement of a desire to find out something 
or to draw a comparison. It says what the child would 
like to do or to know. 
The following are typical of the child’s interest centers 
as he states them himself: 
1. I should like to go to Hollywood to see how moving 
pictures are made. 
2. I should like to find out about the big sheep ranches 
in Wyoming. 
3. I want to visit Yellowstone Park sometime. 
4. Why do we get so much of our fruit from Cali- 
fornia? 
5. What are the Big Trees of California really like? 
6. I should like to find out how the railroad trains cross 
these high mountains. 
7. Why is so much of this area almost a desert? 
8. How do people make a living in these rough lands? 
9. Is there much manufacturing done here? 
10. The map shows that there are great forest areas in 
the mountains and along the Pacific slope. I should like
-P-A-G-E-78
  72 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
to know just what those forests are like. Do foresters take 
care of them? What is their work? 
11. What is a copper mine like? 
12. How does an irrigation system work? Why don’t 
they irrigate all the dry land in this section? 
13. Are the cities on the Pacific coast as busy with boats 
and railroad trains as those on the Atlantic coast? 
14. Why are there so many National Parks in this area? 
15. I should like to find out about the salmon-canning 
factories. 
Gathering data and grouping results around some interest 
centers. Two interest centers which seem to be adapted 
to children of this grade, and which call for an investigation 
of the more essential characteristics of the Western states, 
are: 
1. How do people make a living in these rough mountain 
lands? 
2. Is the Pacific coast as busy a place as the Atlantic, 
with many great steamships coming and going, with many 
trains loaded with freight and passengers, with great fac- 
tories and warehouses, and with a dense population? 
These have, therefore, been chosen for outlining in this 
study. The teacher should feel entirely free to use any 
other problems which appeal more to the children. One or 
two problems of this kind, however, should be worked out 
by the entire class in committee of the whole. The other 
problems may then be assigned to smaller groups. 
How do people make a living in these rough mountain 
lands? 
1. Some farming land. Not all the area is rough. There 
is a wide stretch of land to the east of the Rockies which is 
called the Great Plains. This is found in eastern Colorado, 
Wyoming, Montana, and New Mexico, and is generally 
level enough for farming. In the very heart of the Rockies, 
too, there are many valleys, some of them fifty miles long 
and nearly as wide, which make good farm lands. The 
great valleys just east of the Coast Ranges also have hundreds 
of square miles of flat or gently sloping areas which are 
   
-P-A-G-E-79
  UNIT 3. THE WESTERN STATES 13 
easily cultivated. On the relief map trace with your finger 
the eastern bounds of this section of states. Then notice 
the Great Plains, the valleys within the Rockies, and the 
great valleys of the Pacific slope. Try to think of all these 
as possible farming lands. Are there more uplands than 
lowlands in the Western states? What kind of soils do you 
expect to find in the valleys? Read something about the 
lava soils in the plateau east of the Cascades. 
2. The serious hindrance to Western farmers. Examine the 
rainfall maps and find out the amount of rainfall (a) on 
the Great Plains, (6) in the Rocky Mountain and pla- 
teau areas, (c) in the valleys of the Pacific slope. Where 
is the heaviest rain in this section? the least rain? What 
fraction of the area has less than ten inches of rain? What 
states are included in this group? About what fraction of 
this whole area has rain enough for crops? How much rain 
is enough? What is the annual rainfall at your home? 
See textbooks for reasons why this area is so dry. Imagine 
your hand is the west wind, and let it move slowly over 
the relief map. Wherever the air climbs a highland, there 
will be a chance for rain. Where it descends, that area will 
probably be very dry. Think of the different places, and 
infer what their chances for rainfall will be. Then turn to 
the rainfall map to see if you are right. 
Now turn to the July temperature map. Notice how even 
the temperatures are on the Pacific coast. Why? What is 
the lowest July temperature found in the whole section? 
Where? Why there? What temperature is best for corn? 
What crops could grow in places with a July temperature 
of only 50 to 60 degrees? Would the water that falls as rain 
evaporate rapidly in those places? Why? Then, could 
they farm with less rainfall than in the places having a July 
temperature of 80 degrees or above? 
8. Irrigation and dry farming.

If some of the surface and soil of the Western states is 
favorable for farming, and if the summer temperature is 
suitable for certain crops, what is the one thing needed? 
Where can the water be obtained? Describe an irrigation 
system, showing how the water is stored for future uses, 
how it is brought to the farms, etc. Model in sand an 
irrigation system; in one place, show some land higher than 
the river from which the water for irrigation is taken, and 
study out a way to irrigate this land from the river. 
Make a list of crops which can be grown on irrigated land; 
recalling the high temperatures of Arizona and New Mexico, 
list some of the tree crops of warm lands, as well as the 
field crops. 
On a simple sketch map of the Western states, locate, by 
shading, seven or eight irrigation projects. Is there water 
enough available in the West to reclaim all the dry farm 
lands? 
What is dry farming, and where is it practiced? What 
crops may be grown by this method? 
4. Grazing. Is there rainfall enough on some of the rough 
lands to grow grass? How does this grass differ from the 
blue grass on our lawns? Describe a sheep ranch in Wyo- 
ming. Tell about the herder and his outfit; the sheep dog; 
the care of the sheep; the size of the herd; sheepshearing. 
Why are sheep adapted to the scanty pastures of rough lands? 
5. Fruit growing. What fruits come to us from Cali- 
fornia? Does the orange require the same conditions as 
the apple in order to grow well? Examine an orange to see if 
you can tell something of the climate it requires. Notice 
the tough skin, with oily, bitter rind; the great amount of 
water in the fruit; the tough, varnished leaf; the hard 
wood of the stem. These indicate that the plant grows 
where it is dry. Unlike corn, it has many devices to save
-P-A-G-E-81
   UNIT 3. THE WESTERN STATES 15 
water. The fruit is so watery that we might infer it cannot 
stand frost. Locate Riverside, San Bernardino, and Red- 
lands on the map of California. These are centers of orange 
production. What is the rainfall in these places? What 
is the July temperature? Describe an orange grove. What 
care do the trees need? How is the fruit picked and shipped? 
From the names on cartons containing raisins, find where 
the raisin grapes are grown. Write to the Chamber of 
Commerce at Fresno, California, for free material on raisin 
grapes. What is the rainfall at Fresno? Is it heaviest in 
summer or winter? Tell how the grapes are dried and packed 
for shipment. 
6. Mining. Find out what kinds of mines are found in 
this section. Which is more important, a copper mine or a 
gold mine? Why? What uses of copper can you name? 
Make a list of the states which produce copper. Describe 
a copper mine: the shaft, the tunnels, the ventilators, the 
chambers where the miners work, etc. What is the smelter? 
List the states of this section which have coal. Do you infer 
that there are many railroads in the mountain lands? Then 
will all the available coal beds be mined? The Pacific states 
produce about 8 million tons of coal a year; the total output 
for the United States is usually about 500 million tons. 
Do these states furnish their share? Describe two ways of 
mining for gold. What states lead in gold output? About 
four fifths of all the gold, silver, and copper produced in 
the United States comes from the Western states. 
Oil wells are found in California near Los Angeles, and 
also in Bakersfield, in the Great Valley of California. Out of 
the more than 300 million barrels of petroleum which the 
United States produces in a year, California furnishes about 
one fourth. Does this oil help to make up for the coal 
shortage? Infer several conditions which may be expected 
here because of the supply of oil: oil-burning engines on 
railroads; pipe lines; oil-burning boats on the sea; 
oiled roads; great lines of oil-tank freight cars; enormous 
tanker boats, etc. Where are the other oil wells of the 
Western states? Los Angeles is the largest city in this whole        
-P-A-G-E-82
  16 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
section. What other reasons, besides that of having oil 
wells in its vicinity, can you find to account for this? 
7.4 Lumbering. See forest map. Make a list of the states 
in this section which have extensive forest areas. Why’ are 
great forests found on the west side of the Coast Ranges, the 
Cascades, and the Sierra Nevadas? See rainfall map. Why 
in the Rocky Mountains? What kinds of trees grow in these 
forests? What is meant by National Forests? (Carpenter: 
How the World Is Housed, pages 73-90. Allen: Industrial 
Studies: The United States, pages 253-286.) What special use 
is made of each kind of tree? (Cedar for shingles, spruce for 
paper, etc.) Describe the Douglas fir. Write a list of 
five ways in which forests may be conserved. The children 
should be encouraged to tell from their own observation 
some instances of conservation. Describe the work of a 
forester. Describe a lumber camp. Tell how the trees are 
felled and trimmed, how the logs are taken to the mill. 
Nearly one third of the lumber of the United States comes 
from the Western states. 
With so many great forests along the Pacific slope, we know 
there will be many lumber mills there. Locate the great 
lumber markets. Ask the local dealer to tell you from what 
Western markets he buys his lumber, and how it is shipped 
to him. 
8. Fishing. From the labels on salmon cans, find out 
where some of the canneries are located. Read of the life 
history of the salmon. How are salmon caught? How 
is the fish canned? What are some of the by-products of 
the canneries? What people usually work in the canneries? 
9. Manufacturing. What raw materials found in this 
section could be used for manufactures? What materials 
for manufacturing could be imported from Asia? Is there 
coal enough for extensive manufactures? What about water 
power? What manufacturing is now being carried on? 
Make a list of all the occupations you have found for 
people in the Western states. Decide whether these indus- 
tries would require many or few laborers. Write a para- 
graph about the possible density of population in these
-P-A-G-E-83
  UNIT 3. THE WESTERN STATES 17 
states as compared with that of the Central Plains. Find 
reasons for the rapid development of the Western states. 
Ts the Pacific coast as busy a place as the Atlantic coast? 
1. Turn to a population or city map. Write a very 
careful statement about the number of cities on each coast. 
Describe the two shore lines. Then examine the coal map, 
and write your conclusions about coal for the two coasts. 
Next find the Western section of the United States on the 
largest globe you have. With a string, using the scale of 
miles, find out about how far it is from San Francisco to 
Hongkong, or from Seattle to Nagasaki. Then measure with 
your string the distance from New York to Liverpool. What 
do you conclude about distances from other countries and 
continents? Will this affect the amount of trade on the 
Pacific coast? New York City has almost as much foreign 
trade as all the rest of the ports of our country added 
together. What are some reasons for this? 
2. Now look at a product map of the United States. See 
if you can decide which coast has the best (most produc- 
tive) land back of it. Seaports cannot be busy unless the 
lands back of them (their hinterlands) have many products 
which they are constantly sending to the ports for shipment 
elsewhere. Notice how large the hinterland of New York 
is, because the Eastern mountains are not so high or so 
wall-like as those of the West. This hinterland extends 
almost to the Rocky Mountains. Your state belongs to 
which hinterland, that of the Atlantic or that of the Pacific? 
Does grain and live stock from the Central Plains go east 
or west in shipment? Judging by the surface and the rain- 
fall of the Western hinterland, is it as productive as the 
Eastern? 
8. We have judged from the map that the Pacific coast 
cannot be so busy a place as the Atlantic coast. Now let 
us think what the boats of the Pacific would probably 
carry. What products of this coast are shipped to foreign 
countries? What do foreign countries send in return? 
What products are shipped eastward to other parts of our 
own country? What Eastern wares are shipped to the West?
-P-A-G-E-84
  78 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
Trace three main lines of railroads through the Western 
section. 
Nors. There are so many possible lines of study in this complex area 
that a short outline cannot cover them. The teacher will judge by the 
natural interests of her class, and select further interest centers for group 
work, 
Suggestions for children’s activities. 
1. Model the Western states in sand, locating the most 
important mountain ranges, the Great Valley of California, 
the Willamette Valley, Puget Sound, the Columbia, Colo- 
rado, Rio Grande, and Missouri rivers, and eight or ten 
cities. 
2. Some letters to write: 
(a) To the Bureau of Forestry, Washington, D.C., 
asking for maps and booklets. 
(b) To the Bureau of Mines, Washington, D.C., for 
material on mines and mining. 
(c) To the Secretary of the Los Angeles Chamber of 
Commerce, asking for free advertising material. 
(d) To some of the children of the fifth grade in the schools 
of Portland and Seattle, asking for information about 
salmon and lumber. 
3. Have different groups of children dramatize selected 
events in the life of the Western states. The children should 
choose the event they wish to present and plan the simple 
costumes and action needed. The following list may be 
helpful: 
(a) A scene in an Oregon lumber camp. 
(b) A scene in an orange grove. 
(c) A scene on a ranch in the irrigated area of Utah. 
(d) A buyer from the Western Electric Company inter- 
views the copper dealers at Butte, Montana, regard- 
ing an extensive sale of copper. 
(e) A scene on a sheep ranch in Wyoming. 
(f) A talk with a raisin-grape grower of Fresno, Cali- 
fornia. 
(g) Your lumber dealer pays a visit to the great lumber 
market at Portland and leaves an order for lumber.

(h) A guide takes a party through Yosemite Park. 
(2) A talk with a group of salmon fishers on the Columbia. 
Gj) Frontier Week at Cheyenne. 
4. Plan an automobile trip from your home to some 
point on the Pacific coast. Secure maps showing the main 
automobile highways; then make out a schedule of dates 
and places, and note interesting scenes on the route. 
5. An exhibit of articles from the Western states. A 
committee collects these, and arranges them for display; 
each exhibitor is required to give an explanation of the 
article he furnishes.

        UNIT 4. THE SOUTH 
Time required: 4 weeks 
Finding the starting point. 
1. Things we know the South furnishes us: cotton and 
cotton goods, rice, cane sugar, tobacco, peanuts, fruits and 
vegetables, oysters, beef cattle from Texas, gasoline from 
oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma, lumber for houses, ete. 
2. Our interest in the black race. 
8. Persons we know who live in the South. 
4, Experiences at Southern winter resorts. 
5. Places we have visited in the South. 
6. Advertisements about the South which we have seen 
in newspapers and magazines. 
7. History stories of Ponce de Leon, De Soto, Captain 
John Smith, Pocahontas, etc. 
8. Southern heroes we have read about: Washington, 
Jefferson, Patrick Henry, Robert E. Lee, etc. 
9. Southern songs we like: “ Dixie’; “Old Folks at 
Home”; “Old Kentucky Home”; “Maryland, My 
Maryland”; ete. 
10. Southern stories and poems we have read: Stories by 
Joel Chandler Harris, Ruth McEnery Stewart, Molly Sewell, 
Charles Egbert Craddock, and J. T. Trowbridge. Poems 
by Sidney Lanier, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and others.” 
Reading the map. Maps used: physical, political, rail- 
road, population, rainfall, temperature, coal, cotton, 
corn. 
1. When I look at a map of the United States, I can see 
that the South is about one fourth of the whole country. 
I wonder if it has one fourth of the population. 
2. Most of the area is a plain, except for the Appalachians, 
part of the Ozark Plateau, and the High Plains in Texas. 
3. This section has more coast line than any other group 
of states. The coast line is uneven in many places. I 
wonder if there are many good harbors. Are Southern 
people great seamen? 
81

  82 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY © 
4. Chesapeake Bay is long, and its shore line is much 
broken. 
5. There are many swamps along the coast. This is very 
different from the Pacific coast. 
6. Louisiana and Florida have no highland at all. Missis- 
sippi has very little. 
7. There are many rivers in the South. Those in the 
eastern part are not so long as those in the western part. So 
many rivers come from the mountains that I think there 
must be much water power here. 
8. I see many lakes in Florida. Are they glacial lakes, 
like those in Minnesota? 
9. I think railroading would be very easy over much of 
the South because it is a plain; the railroad map of the 
United States shows that the South does not have so many 
railroads as some other parts of the country. 
10. The population map does not show any areas of very 
dense population. The areas of least population are in 
Florida and western Texas. I wonder why. 
11. The temperature map interests me. I find that most 
of the plains areas of the South have a July temperature 
above 80 degrees. 
12. The rainfall map shows me that the South has plenty 
of rain everywhere, except in western Texas and Oklahoma 
(west of the 20-inch rainfall line). 
13. On the map which shows where cotton is grown, I 
find the areas of heavy production are not along the coast, 
but are farther inland. Texas has the largest area. There is 
a big cotton district along the Mississippi. Another is on the 
upper coastal plains of South Carolina, Georgia, and Ala- 
bama. They do not grow much cotton in the Appalachians. 
14. The corn map shows that they grow corn almost 
everywhere through the South. I suppose many of the 
people live on farms here. 
15. The coal map shows that most of the coal of this 
area is in the Appalachians. 
16. There are not so many cities in the South as in the 
North. 
    
-P-A-G-E-89
  UNIT 4. THE SOUTH 83 
Finding some interest centers. 
1. I should like to know more about boats on the Mis- 
sissippi River. 
2. Is the South, like the Central Plains, a great food- 
producing region? 
8. The advertisements about cypress wood interest me. 
4. What is the tobacco plant like, and how is it raised? 
5. I should like to know about alligators and other inter- 
esting animals in Florida. 
6. I want to know more about how they raise cotton. 
7. I will see what I can find out about peanuts. 
8. I will find out all I can about making cane sugar; it 
would be interesting to compare sugar cane and sugar 
beets. 
9. Are there many great factories in the South? 
10. What do the black people of the South do for a living? 
How is the South helping the negro? 
11. I should like to find out about Birmingham, because 
I have heard it is the Pittsburgh of the South. 
12. I should like to trace the main railroad lines of the 
South and tell about some of the big cities along them., 
18. New Orleans would be an interesting place to visit. 
14. Ishould like to know more about life in the mountains 
of Kentucky and Tennessee. 
15. I should like to make a comparison between the 
Central Plains and the Coastal Plains as a place for a 
home. 
16. I should like to go to Oklahoma to see the Indians 
there. 
Working out some of the problems. How does the South 
help to provide food and clothing for the whole country? 
1. Farming in the South. Recall the map facts you found. 
What part of the South is a plain, and so has a surface suited 
to farming? ‘There are also many fertile valleys in the 
mountains, with fine farm land. Where is the Piedmont 
Region, and why is it good farming land? Is the area along 
the coast favorable? What are its disadvantages? What 
other areas are too swamp-like for ordinary farming? (Find 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
      
     84 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
descriptions of surface of the country in your books.) Look 
for statements about the soils of the South. Locate the 
Black Belt; the belt of sandy soils. Where would you find 
rich river soils? Has the South much glacial soil? What 
fertilizers are needed? Can the South furnish these? 
Do forests cover much of the area? Locate the larger 
forest areas on the map. A little less than one third of the 
land in the South is improved. What reasons can you 
find for this? 
Judging by the rainfall map, is rain sufficient over all the 
area? Does the rain come mostly in winter, as in southern 
California? in early summer, as in the Central Plains? 
Is it quite well distributed throughout the year? How 
about the temperatures in summer and in winter? Nearly 
all the South has a frostless season of at least seven months. 
How long is the growing season in your community? Why is 
the South sometimes visited by cold waves in winter? What 
disadvantage is this? How is it an advantage as far as 
human energy is concerned? 
Are farms here large? What is a plantation? a ranch? 
Do most farmers own the land they cultivate? (About half 
the farms are cultivated by tenants. Is this a good thing?) 
Do many of the people live on farms? Is the land high- 
priced? 
What are the leading food crops grown in the South? 
Do these require many farm laborers? Is farm labor abun- 
dant here? 
Summarize all the points favorable to farming in the 
South. Find reasons to show why agriculture is the most 
important industry of the South. 
2. Foods furnished by the South. (Statistics from Blue 
Book of Southern Progress, 1923.) 
(a) Cane sugar. The South furnishes 25 per cent of the 
country’s sugar. What soils are suited to sugar cane? 
What amount of rainfall? How long a frostless season is 
required? How is ground prepared for cane? How is cane 
planted? How cultivated? How harvested? How is the 
cane taken to the mill? Describe briefly how sugar is made.   
-P-A-G-E-91
UNIT 4. THE SOUTH 85 
Where are the sugar-cane areas? Is more land available 
for cane? Why is it not all used? 
Compare sugar cane and sugar beets as to the following 
points: climatic requirements, soil requirements, labor re- 
quirements, sugar content, yield per acre, processes of sugar 
making, and by-products. (Journal of Geography, 1920, 
Vol. 19, page 255.) Why does not our country produce all 
the sugar needed, instead of importing so much? 
(b) Rice. The South furnishes about 80 per cent of the 
country’s rice. (Journal of Geography, November, 1922.) 
What are the best conditions for growing rice? (Air and 
soil both wet.) Tell how the ground is prepared for it; 
how it is planted; how the fields are flooded; how the crop 
is harvested: threshing, hulling, polishing. Where are the 
best rice areas? How is rice shipped from Louisiana to 
New York? How is rice packed when you buy it at the 
grocer’s? Do you know a good way to cook rice? 
(c) Fruits and vegetables. The South produces 91 per 
cent of the sweet potatoes, 90 per cent of winter and early 
spring vegetables, 40 per cent of the cabbages, 40 per cent of 
peaches and citrus fruits, 28 per cent of the berries, 25 per 
cent of the apples, 15 per cent of the pears of the country. 
What fruits and vegetables do you get in your home 
market from the South? Find out, if you can, just where 
they come from. What are some reasons for the high rank 
of the South in winter and early spring vegetables? (Mild 
temperatures, abundant rain, cheap fertilizers, labor supply, 
fast trains to Northern markets, etc.) Why does the South 
rank higher than the Pacific states in vegetables? Locate 
on a map the truck-farm area of the South. Trace railroads 
from these areas to Northern and Northwestern markets. 
Where is the citrus-fruit area? Why is it so small? Why 
does California grow more citrus fruits than the South? 
Where are pineapples grown? Under what conditions do 
they grow best? 
(d) Meat. The South has about 35 per cent of the hogs, 
33 per cent of the cattle, and 19 per cent of the sheep of 
the country. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  86 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
What advantages has the South forthe live-stock industry? 
What food for stock is grown here? Judging by the rain- 
fall and the temperature, what opportunity is there for 
pasture and for hay? Must stock here be warmly housed 
in winter? What disadvantages does a southern country 
offer? To what markets are Texas cattle sent? Where in 
the South would you expect to find sheep? Why are there 
so many more hogs than sheep? Describe how hogs may 
feed on mast; on peanuts. 
(e) Sea foods. Find out about oyster beds along Chesa- 
peake Bay. What kind of waters do oysters like? What 
temperatures? What do they feed on? How are oysters 
gathered? How sent to market? 
Read about shad, herring, and any other sea food you can 
find which is abundant in the South. 
(f) Corn. The South furnishes about 35 per cent of 
the country’s corn. 
Turn to the study of the Central Plains to find a discussion 
on corn. Find reasons why the South, though not in the 
corn belt, is an important producer of corn. How do the 
people of the South use corn? 
8. Clothing material furnished by the South. The South 
furnishes almost 100 per cent of the country’s cotton. 
What are some uses of cotton you can name? (Clothing, 
household linen, used in making automobile tires, garden 
hose, etc.) We have seen by the map that most of the 
cotton is grown on the Coastal Plain. Let us see why that 
is such a good cotton area. What does cotton require as to 
soil, temperature, amount of rainfall, length of season with- 
out frost? Why does cotton not grow well in the corn belt? 
the wheat belt? How is the ground prepared for cotton? 
How is cotton cultivated? How picked? Find how cotton 
and corn are somewhat alike in planting, cultivating, and 
picking. How much hand work is required for cotton? 
How much of the work can be done by machinery? What 
enemies has the plant? How is the South fighting the 
boll weevil? 
How do they get the seeds out? (There is a cotton gin
-P-A-G-E-93
UNIT 4. THE SOUTH 87 
at almost every country store. The ginner keeps the seeds 
as payment for his work. He puts them through the seed 
mill, where they are crushed to make oil or are ground into 
meal. What use is made of the oil and the meal?) 
How is cotton baled for shipping? How are the bales 
taken to the seaport? Describe the big cotton warehouses 
at New Orleans or Galveston. Name other cotton-shipping 
ports. 
Where are the Southern cotton mills located? the Northern 
mills? What foreign countries also have great mills? How 
is cotton spun? woven into cloth? Name several kinds of 
cotton cloth. How is the cloth dyed? What is meant by 
prints? How does gingham differ from percale or calico? 
What other countries of the world raise cotton? Why do 
we import some cotton from Egypt? What are some of the 
reasons why the South ships away so much of her cotton, 
instead of manufacturing it all at home? 
Why do the cotton-belt farmers now plant a great variety 
of crops, instead of putting most of their acreage in cotton? 
What are the risks in one-crop farming? Is the same thing 
true in the wheat belt? 
What opportunities does the South offer for manufacturing? 
1. What raw materials are found here? (Cotton and 
cottonseed, lumber products, fruits and vegetables, sea 
foods, sugar cane, minerals for making fertilizers, iron ore, 
petroleum, etc.). Add others to this list. What articles 
might be manufactured from such materials? Does the 
country need these? 
2. Has the South much fuel or water power? Find out 
what fraction of the country’s coal output comes from the 
South. Is it high-grade coal? Where are the coal fields? 
(See coal map.) Where are the Southern oil fields? the 
natural-gas areas? 
What are some of the water-power possibilities? (See 
Blue Book of Southern Progress, 1923, pages 107-108, for 
map and description.) What special advantages has the 
South for the development of water power? How does the 
distribution of rainfall throughout the year favor it? How
-P-A-G-E-94
  88 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
do the mild winters favor it? What is meant by the Fall 
Line? Where is it? Name four cities on this line. What 
is the chance for abundant labor supply? (Judge by the 
density of white population the possibility of using negroes 
for work in factories, the opportunities for getting foreign 
immigrants.) Could the South support a larger popula- 
tion? 
Are transportation facilities provided: railroads, auto- 
mobile highways, river traffic, seaports? Does the Panama 
Canal help the South? What advantages has New Orleans? 
Galveston? Mobile? Savannah? Charleston? Wilmington? 
Baltimore? Where could the South sell her manufactures? 
(Home demand; demand in other parts of the country; 
foreign markets.) What is now being manufactured in the 
South? Make as complete a list as you can of articles made 
here. What are the leading manufacturing cities? Find 
reasons for their supremacy. What advantages made 
Baltimore first of the South in population? 
Some suggestions for children’s activities. 
1. Model the area in sand. Build up the sand to show 
the Appalachians, parts of the Ozark Plateau, and the Great 
Plains. Locate six rivers and ten cities. 
2. Groups of children might dramatize selected events 
in Southern life and industry, such as a scene at the wharf 
in New Orleans; in the oil fields of Oklahoma; in the 
orange groves of Florida; in the rice fields of Louisiana; 
mountain life in eastern Tennessee; a group of capitalists 
discuss Atlanta as a place to set up a farm-implement 
factory; ete. 
8. Have an exhibit of Southern products. Include’ pic- 
tures as well as samples of any materials which the South 
contributes to us. 
4, Have children give talks on selected subjects such as 
(a) my visit to El Paso, (b) a winter vacation at Palm Beach, 
(ce) my trip down the Mississippi, (d) an automobile trip 
through the South, (e) why I should like to live in the South, 
(f) my visit to our National Capital. 
5. Make a booklet of the South. Include in it maps,

pictures, drawings, clippings, and brief original write-ups 
of the more important Southern interests.

  UNIT 5. NEW ENGLAND— MIDDLE ATLANTIC 91 
Reading the map. Maps used: physical, political, tem- 
perature, rainfall, population, coal, forest. 
1. As I look at this section on the map of the United 
States, it seems very small. I wonder why it is so important, 
since it is the smallest division. Does it have the greatest 
population? 
2. It extends the farthest north of any part of the country. 
I should expect cold winters in Maine. 
3. It has many mountains. Very little of the area is in 
lowland, except along some rivers and around the Great 
Lakes and the seacoast. I do not expect to find it a great 
farming region. 
4. It touches the Central Plains and the Coastal Plains. 
They would probably be good neighbors to this small high- 
land area, because they are the best farming regions in the 
country. 
5. The coast line is very much broken. I think there 
will be many good harbors. There are many little islands 
around the New England coast. This makes me think of 
Alaska. 
6. Two rivers, the Hudson and the Connecticut, flow 
almost straight south. The Susquehanna and the Delaware 
twist about. 
7. New England is almost fenced off from New York by 
a line of mountains. Wouldn’t that interfere with railroads? 
8. In New York, I see a break in the Appalachian high- 
land, so there is an easy passage from the Hudson River 
to the Plains around the lakes. (The teacher suggests that 
they examine the entire length of the Appalachians to see 
if there is another: such passageway. Then, will this one 
pass be a great advantage to New York, as well as to the 
Central Plains?) 
9. By the rainfall map, all the area gets sufficient rain. 
10. The population map shows this is the most densely 
populated part of the country. I wonder why? The pop- 
ulation is not distributed so evenly over this section as over 
the South. Northern Maine is almost empty. 
11. Railroads are thick here, but they are not so evenly 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  92 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
distributed as on the Central Plains. I think the moun- 
tains interfere. 
12. The coal map shows that Pennsylvania has large 
coal fields. New England has none. 
13. This section touches Canada. I wonder if it has much 
trade with Canada. 
14, There are many lakes here. Were they caused by 
the glaciers? 
Discovering interest centers. I should like to visit New 
York and see the high buildings. I want to find out about 
Niagara Falls and the water-power plants there. I should 
like to know more about Boston and Bunker Hill and 
Plymouth Rock and other historic places. I should like 
to ride down the Hudson in a big boat. The Pennsylvania 
coal mines interest me. I will find out about the fishing 
town of Gloucester; we get mackerel from there. I have 
heard about the paper mills in Maine, and should like to 
learn more. I should like to study about Pittsburgh, and 
how the big blast furnaces work. Why does so much of 
our ready-made clothing come from this area? The woolen 
mills interest me. Why is this the most thickly populated 
part of the country? How did it happen that New York 
became the largest city? How would farming here differ 
from farming in the Central Plains or the South? Is lum- 
bering here different from that in Oregon? What is a maple- 
sugar camp like? 
Working out some of the problems. How can this small 
area support so large a population? 
1. Some figure facts. Get figure facts as to the area and 
population of this section. Divide population figure by 
area figure and find density per square mile. Find what 
fraction of the country’s population belongs here. What 
per cent of the people here live in cities. Compare with the 
South in per cent of city people. 
From the population map, decide where the spots of 
greatest density are; of lowest density; turn to the physical 
map to find some reasons for the differences. Why has 
Pennsylvania dense areas at the west and east and rela-
-P-A-G-E-99
  
UNIT 5. NEW ENGLAND — MIDDLE ATLANTIC 99 
tively sparse areas near the central part? Does the coal 
map help to explain this? Why are the three northern 
states in New England so sparsely settled, while the three 
southern states are crowded? New York has a rim of 
dense population along the coast, another dense belt follows - 
the Hudson, then bends westward toward the Great Lakes. 
Name some of the large cities in these densely populated 
areas. Name some physical features, as the Catskills, 
which seem to hinder dense settlements, and others, as the 
Connecticut Valley, which encourage them. 
2. Conditions that help to determine the population of the 
area. 
(a) Dense population and coal. We have learned that an 
area where there are many kinds of manufacturing can 
support a large population. One of the first requirements 
for extensive manufacture is coal, or some other form of 
fuel. Coal attracts great industries. Let us find out about 
the possibilities for fuel and power in this area. 
Turn to the coal map and locate the coal areas of Penn- 
sylvania. Compare with the population map. Do you 
find a relation between the coal areas and dense population? 
Find statements in your books as to the bituminous area 
of western Pennsylvania; the anthracite fields in the eastern 
part. What large cities have grown up in each area? (Penn- 
sylvania produces about one third of the country’s coal 
tonnage. What part of the anthracite tonnage does she 
produce?) 
Describe a coal mine (Allen: Industrial Studies: The 
United States, pages 138-165. Carpenter: New Geographi- 
cal Reader: North America, pages 283-302), its shafts, 
tunnels, lighting, ventilation, drainage; the work of the 
miner — blasting, removing coal; the work of the breaker; 
how coke is made; uses of coke; by-products of coke 
making. 
What waterways provide means of cheap transportation 
for bituminous coal? How is anthracite coal taken to the 
seaports? We notice that New England has no coal; yet 
her seaboard population is very dense. This calls for coal. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  94 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
How is Pennsylvania or Virginia coal sent to New England? 
Would freight cost be very great? How far is New York 
City from the anthracite field? Does this help to explain 
why New York has grown so great? How far is the bitumi- 
nous area from Lake Erie? Trace the railway to the lake. 
How is coal shipped on the lakes? How would Buffalo get 
its coal supply? 
Other sources of power: oil and natural gas. Where found 
in this area? Importance in industry? 
(b) Dense population and water power. Where is Niagara? 
Is it well located for development and distribution of power? 
What is the height of the fall? Describe water-power plant 
here — how water is conveyed from the river, above the 
falls; how it drops down immense steel tubes upon turbine 
wheels; how the used water is led off and emptied into the 
Niagara gorge. (Carpenter: New Geographical Reader: 
North America, page 278.) Why is power development 
here so satisfactory? What horse power is developed? 
Name some cities to which this power is sent. Is this power 
as cheap as coal power? What manufactures has Buffalo? 
New England also has much water power. Turn to the 
physical map and notice the number of rivers; what is their 
general direction? How many can you find which have 
their sources in lakes? Why is this an advantage in a water- 
power stream? From the rainfall map, determine the 
average yearly rainfall here. How will this affect the streams? 
Is there a long dry season in New England? What differ- 
ence would that make in water-power development? Are 
New England streams usually rock-bedded? Why an ad- 
vantage? The Missouri River (Central Plains) in its widest 
parts has neither rock beds nor rock banks. Do you wonder 
that there are no great water-power plants along the Mis- 
souri? 
Another advantage of New England streams is that in 
many instances the falls of the river are not very far from 
the mouth. Show how glaciation helped to bring this 
about. Why is this favorable? Locate four or five cities 
which have developed at or near falls. What is manufac-
-P-A-G-E-101
  UNIT 5. NEW ENGLAND— MIDDLE ATLANTIC 95 
tured at Lowell, Lawrence, Nashua, Manchester, Fall River, 
Pawtucket, etc.? Water power in these cities must be 
supplemented by coal power. Where does the coal come 
from? 
(c) Dense population and raw materials. What raw 
materials are found here which may be used in manufactures? 
Iron ore, cement rock, brick clay, glass sand, lumber, fish, 
fruits and vegetables (canning and preserving). Add to 
this list as you find other materials mentioned. Is the 
variety and amount of materials as great as that found in 
the Mid-West? in the South? Where are the centers of 
manufacture of iron and steel? What advantages has 
Pittsburgh? Bethlehem? Buffalo? Philadelphia? (Compare 
with Gary and Birmingham.) Describe a blast furnace. 
What is pig iron? What is meant by the Bessemer process 
in steel making? (Allen: Industrial Studies: The United 
States, page 176. Carpenter: New Geographical Reader: 
North America, page 292. Journal of Geography, April, 1923.) 
What kinds of iron and steel articles are made in these 
great centers? What is made in New England? Why are 
the articles calling for little raw material but much work- 
manship more profitably made in New England? Where do 
hooks and eyes, for instance, come from? Do steel rails 
come from the same part of the section? Are agricultural 
implements made extensively here? Why not? Where is 
shipbuilding carried on? 
Cement rock is abundant here, as in many other parts of 
the United States. Why does this section lead in cement 
manufacture? 
Where are the forest areas of this section? Describe a 
lumber camp in Maine. How is it unlike an Oregon camp? 
The wood useless for lumber may be used in what ways? 
Describe the processes of making paper (pulp making, 
pressing into sheets, sizing and finishing). (Allen: Industrial 
Studies: The United States, pages 265-266. Smith: Commerce 
and Industry, page 205.) 
Fish, fruits, and vegetables call for many workers. Where 
are the fishing grounds? Kinds of fish; methods of fishing 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
96 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
(seining and trawling); curing and canning; dangers of 
fisherman’s life. Products from cod. Gloucester, an inter- 
esting fishing city. (Allen: Industrial Studies: The United 
States, page 287.) Where are fruit areas? truck farms? 
Why are the lake plains well located for fruit growing? 
What raw materials are brought in from outside? (Cotton, 
wool, iron ore, copper, hides, sugar for refining, etc.) Why 
does it pay to bring such materials to this area for manu- 
facture? How can New England cotton mills compete with 
Southern mills? In which section is the home market for 
the goods greatest? Which has more abundant labor supply? 
Where are the great woolen mills? Where do they get 
their wool? Is there much demand for woolen goods in this 
part of the country? Where is rug and carpet making ex- 
tensive? 
Where are the shoe manufactures? How can they com- 
pete with those of the Mid-West? Where do the hides and 
skins come from? Describe a visit to a great shoe factory. 
(d) Dense population and energizing climate. We call a 
climate energizing if it makes people feel like working. 
Scientists tell us the best climates for developing human 
energy have winters that are not too cold, and summers not 
too hot; there is rain enough for crops, and the air has a 
favorable amount of moisture; there must also be changes 
in temperature, air pressure, etc., often enough to be stimu- 
lating. See the temperature and rainfall maps for this 
area. Find January and July temperatures; are they 
extreme? Is the rainfall sufficient and well distributed 
throughout the year? Is this area visited by many cyclonic 
storms (highs and lows)? Judging by the coastal position, 
do you expect favorable humidity in the air? Find state- 
ments in your books about the climate, and reach a conclu- 
sion as to whether this is a good climate for human energy. 
Judging by the many famous men and women this area has 
produced, what is your conclusion? How does this area 
compare with the corn belt or the cotton belt in climate? 
in population? 
In the high latitudes of this area the summer days are 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
       NEW ENGLAND — MIDDLE ATLANTIC 97 
  UNIT 5. 
long, while the winter days are short. Are the winter days 
in Maine as long as those in Florida? Does this affect food 
production? What effect will the highlands have on the 
climate? 
(e) Density of population and coastal location. Describe 
carefully the coast line of this area, as you interpret it from 
the map and from statements in your books. How does it 
differ from the Gulf coast? the Pacific coast? Name five 
large seaports along this coast. Why is there not a great 
seaport on Cape Cod? on the coast of eastern Maine? 
Judging by the population map, does the coastal area favor 
dense population? What parts of the coast have rather 
sparse populations? Can you think of some reasons for this? 
The largest port — New York City — developed on New 
York Bay, rather than on Chesapeake, Delaware, or Boston 
bays. Let us find some reasons for this. From the maps, 
discover such facts as the following: New York is about 
halfway down the Atlantic coast; it has the Hudson, a 
tidal river; the Hudson Valley is behind it; the Mohawk 
Valley gives an easy pass through the highlands, and con- 
nects the Hudson Valley with the Lake Plains and Central 
Plains; the Coastal Plains to the south afford easy railroad 
connections; the hinterland of New York City includes 
much of the food-producing, textile-growing, and coal- 
producing areas of the country and extends almost to the 
Rockies. Find references in your books as to the harbor 
of New York (depth of water, safety of the channels, free- 
dom from fog and ice, wharfage room, anchorage room, etc.). 
Write a page telling some reasons why New York has be- 
come such a large city. In the same way, study Boston and 
Philadelphia. Which port is nearest to Europe? 
(f) Density of population and farming land. What did 
you notice as to density of population in the Central Plains, 
where farming is the chief industry? in the South? Why is 
farming not usually the chief business in densely populated 
areas? (India and China are interesting exceptions.) 
Find in your textbooks references to farming in New Eng- 
land. Does the surface of the country encourage farming?

  How did the glaciers affect the surface? the soils? Can 
New England compete with the Mid-West in grain pro- 
duction? What special crops are grown here? Account 
for tobacco growing in the Connecticut Valley; corn (for 
canning) in Maine; cranberries, potatoes, apples, etc. 
Would you expect large farms here, as in Iowa or Kansas? 
Where is the best farm land? Why are there many aban- 
doned farms? Why is it that foreigners settle on some of 
the hill farms and prosper? What is a good use for rocky 
and hilly fields? 
New York has more area in plains. Where are these 
lowland areas? What special crops are grown on the Lake 
Plains, and why? Dairying is a form of intensive agriculture 
which is profitable under favorable conditions. Why does 
New York rank so high in dairying? (Good forage crops, 
rapid transportation, dense population, etc.) What right 
of way have the milk trains? Does dairying give employ- 
ment to more people than ordinary farm work? What type 
of farm is found in Pennsylvania? in New Jersey? Do truck 
farms and fruit farms call for many laborers? 
In general, do conditions in this section encourage exten- 
sive farming? Write a paragraph showing how the type of 
farming profitable here calls for many helpers. Can this 
section produce food enough for its many people? Where 
will it get flour, meat, sugar, chickens and eggs, butter, etc.? 
(g) Density of population and inland transportation. What 
rivers are used extensively for transportation? Find refer- 
ences in textbooks and encyclopedias to the Hudson, Con- 
necticut, Delaware, Susquehanna, ete. Discuss the Erie 
Barge Canal, the Cape Cod Canal, and the Chesapeake and 
Delaware Canal. 
Trace on the railroad map the New York Central lines 
from New York to Chicago; the Pennsylvania lines; the 
Baltimore and Ohio. What river valleys help to give easy 
grades through the mountains? ‘Trace the Boston and 
Albany route, in New England. Read about the Hoosac 
Tunnel and how it cuts through the Berkshires. Also, trace 
the New York, New Haven and Hartford, the main railroad

UNIT 5. NEW ENGLAND— MIDDLE ATLANTIC 99 
line of New England. Now compare the railroad and popu- 
lation maps. Is the thickest net of railroads found where 
the population is densest? 
An automobile highway map will help to explain the op- 
portunities for transportation here. Is much business done 
by motor trucks in New England? Why?

    UNIT 6. CANADA, NEWFOUNDLAND, 
AND LABRADOR 
Time required: 2 weeks 
Nore. A study of Alaska, following much the same plan, may be in- 
cluded in this unit, if desirable. 
Introduction. Some of the following topics may serve te 
introduce this study of our northern neighbor in an informal 
discussion with the children: 
1. Items of current interest about Canada. 
2. What we know about the Eskimos of northern Canada 
and Labrador. 
8. Persons we know who have invested in Canadian wheat 
land. 
4. Canadian soldiers and their record in the World War. 
5. Persons we know who live in Canada. 
6. Travelers’ accounts of trips through the Canadian 
Rockies or along the St. Lawrence River. 
7. Stories of the Klondike. 
8. Adventures of the deep-sea fishermen on the Grand 
Banks. 
9. Stories of Dr. Grenfell and his work in Newfoundland 
and Labrador. 
10. Tales of the Northwest Mounted Police. 
11. Furs which people wear. Stories about the Hudson’s 
Bay Company. 
12. Incidents from Kipling’s Captains Courageous; Wal- 
lace’s The Lure of the Labrador Wild. 
13. Longfellow’s description of the village of Grand Pré 
in “ Evangeline.” 
14. History stories: the capture of Quebec, the expedi- 
tions of Cartier, La Salle, Champlain, and others. 
Finding the problem. The problems which follow are 
typical of those which the children may be led to discover 
for themselves as a result of the introductory discussion. 
They should then select one of their own problems as an 
interest center for the study. 
100
-P-A-G-E-107
  UNIT 6. CANADA, NEWFOUNDLAND, LABRADOR 101 
1. Why do not more people live in such a large country? 
2. Why do Americans sometimes go to Canada to make 
homes for themselves? 
8. Why are Canadians so proud of their country? 
4, Could Canada provide homes for people from over- 
crowded lands? 
5. Why should Canada and the United States be good 
neighbors? 
6. Does a Canadian boy or girl have as much opportunity 
to advance in the world as an American boy or girl? 
If we choose the first problem for our study, it will help 
us to understand Canada’s present development and to see 
something of her possible future. A fuller statement of the 
problem is as follows: Canada is larger than the United 
States. Its population, however, is less than one tenth that of 
our country. What conditions account for this? What are 
some of its possibilities for the future? 
The working out of the problem involves the selection 
and organization of the data essential to the solution of 
the problem, together with a statement of conclusions de- 
rived from them. Materials called for are maps, pictures, 
books, magazine articles, newspaper clippings, ete. The 
study of the map, however, should be the first form of in- 
vestigation for any problem. 
What does the map tell us regarding Canada? The map 
of Canada tells so many large, simple, and significant truths 
that it is especially well adapted to the teaching of map 
reading. With some care in questioning on the part of the 
teacher, the children may discover for themselves most of 
the following items, or similar ones. Two recitation periods 
could be well spent in this work. Begin with the physical 
maps of North America and of Canada in the textbooks. 
Then use climate, product, railroad, and population maps. 
Every child should be able to read the map fairly well before 
he takes up the other reading matter in the books. Some of 
the discoveries of these young map readers might be written 
in brief, clear statements. They will help to answer the 
problem we have selected.

Map facts the children will find. 
1. Canada is in the widest part of the continent. 
2. Part of Canada is so far north that the Arctic Circle 
crosses it. This makes us think of long cold winters, with 
almost no sunshine. 
8. There is a wide belt of mountains along the west side 
(just as in the United States), but it does not bulge eastward 
so far and so leaves more room for the plains. 
4. The Pacific slope in Canada does not have a chain of 
valleys to correspond with the Great Valley of California 
or the Willamette Valley in the United States. 
5. There are many islands around all the coasts of Canada. 
Those on the north have no towns mapped on them. 
6. Half of the Pacific coast line of this region belongs to 
Alaska and not to Canada. 
7. Canada, unlike the United States, has almost no 
coastal plain along the Atlantic. 
8. A long stretch of the Atlantic coast belongs to Labra- 
dor and not to Canada. 
9. The St. Lawrence River is so wide at the mouth that 
the tidewater can come in for a long distance. 'There are 
several large cities along this river valley, but none are near 
the mouth. 
10. The Great Lakes form part of the Canadian boundary. 
There are not so many large cities on the Canadian side of 
the lakes as on the American side. The only province which 
touches the Great Lakes is the large, irregular one called 
Ontario. 
11. Unlike the United States, Canada has a wide plain 
in the north which slopes toward the Arctic Ocean. The 
map does not show any cities on this plain, although there 
are several forts. These make us think of Hudson’s Bay 
Company and its Indian hunters and trappers. There are 
two large territories or districts mapped on this plain. 
12. Canada, like the United States, has a central plain. 
13. There are many lakes on the central plain and on the 
Arctic slope. This would not be true if the climate were 
dry and hot.
-P-A-G-E-109
    
UNIT 6. CANADA, NEWFOUNDLAND, LABRADOR 103 
14, Canada has many rivers. Some short ones flow into 
Hudson Bay and the Great Lakes; a very long one, the 
Mackenzie, flows into the Arctic Ocean. This makes us 
realize how wide the Arctic plain is. 
15. Canada has a great bay in the northeast. It is not 
so large as the Gulf of Mexico and does not have so many 
towns on its shores. The provinces of Ontario and Quebec 
border on this bay. 
16. The Pacific coast line is very irregular, and looks as 
if it might have many good harbors because it is a fiorded 
coast, but the map shows few cities here. 
17. Canada is divided into a few provinces instead of into 
many states. Two of these are on the central plain. The 
product map shows that wheat is grown here. 
18. Three small provinces are in the eastern part. This 
makes us think of the small states in New England. All the 
other provinces are very large. 
19. The four provinces in the western half use the 60th 
parallel for their northern boundary. There are almost no 
towns or railroads north of this parallel. 
20. The railroads are all crowded into the southern part 
of Canada. All the railroads go around the southern end 
of Lake Winnipeg. This reminds us of Lake Michigan and 
Chicago. At several points the railroads cross over into 
the United States. It will be interesting to find out just 
why they cross at these points. 
21. The province of Quebec has few towns or railroads 
north of the 50th parallel. 
22. There are several places where furs and timber are 
shown on the product map. This makes us think of animals 
that live in forests or near rivers — the bear, fox, mink, 
beaver, otter, lynx, etc. Perhaps some of the furs we wear 
came from these places. 
23. The United States is the only near neighbor with 
which Canada could have much trade. All but two of the 
nine provinces border on our country. 
How do the facts you have read in the map help to answer 
our problem?
-P-A-G-E-110
“104 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
Problems within the problem. The map has told us that 
parts of Canada are too mountainous or too cold or too 
densely wooded to be very attractive to people who are 
seeking new homes. In fact, almost one fourth of the land in 
the Dominion has not even been explored, and a much 
larger part has not been settled. It is estimated that less 
than one third of the land area could ever be used for farm 
land. Let us find out who live in Canada, and what it has 
to offer its people. 
1. What kind of people live in Canada, Newfoundland, 
and Labrador? (Eskimos in Labrador and on the Arctic 
plain. Indians in reservations throughout the country. 
French-speaking people in the province of Quebec; English- 
speaking people in other provinces. A few Hindus and 
Japanese in British Columbia.) 
2. Where is the population the most dense, and why? 
(To answer this problem, we must know whether the cli- 
mate and the surface favor dense population.) 
(a) What proportion of Canada has a climate favorable 
to a dense population. Compare the eastern prov- 
inces with New England in climate; the interior with 
Minnesota; the Pacific with Washington and Oregon; 
the northern districts with Alaska. How does the 
Chinook wind benefit Alberta? 
(b) What proportion of Canada has surface and soils 
favorable to a dense population? 
(c) Where is the largest cluster of cities? Why? 
8. What do the people do for a living? 
(a) In the central plain? in British Columbia? in the 
provinces along the Great Lakes and the St. Law- 
rence River? 
(b) Are the natural industries such as to require many 
workers or few? What is true for wheat farming? 
lumbering? mining? fishing? the fur trade? fruit 
raising? dairying? 
4. Have Canada and Newfoundland minerals which 
favor industrial development?
-P-A-G-E-111
  UNIT 6. CANADA, NEWFOUNDLAND, LABRADOR 105 
(a) Coal. Canada is second only to the United States in 
amount of available coal. Hard coal is found in 
western Alberta; soft coal in Nova Scotia, Alberta, 
British Columbia. Are the coal fields located as 
favorably as those of the United States? 
(b) Iron. In Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec, ete. 
(ec) Petroleum, copper, asbestos, silver, gold, nickel, etc. 
5. Does Canada have abundant water power to use in 
her industries? Notice the many rivers with falls, fortu- 
nately located in some of the places where coal is lacking 
and where raw materials are abundant. 
6. What manufactures could Canada develop? 
(a) From her own raw material: flour mills, packing 
plants, paper mills, lumber mills, steel works, leather 
works, fruit canning, fish canning, butter and cheese 
making. 
(b) Articles she now imports: farm machinery, tractors, 
automobiles, boats, railroad cars, rails, rubber goods, 
clothing, ete. 
7. What parts of the country have the best advantages 
for water transportation? Are the railroad lines so located 
as to encourage the settling of the new areas? How are the 
railroads located with regard to farm lands? timber areas? 
ore fields? Then where could mills be located? 
8. What advantages has Canada for foreign trade? 
(a) Location, midway between Europe and Asia, and 
adjoining the United States. 
(b) Excellent harbors, like those of Halifax, Quebec, 
Montreal, Vancouver, etc. 
(c) Navigable lakes and rivers. 
(d) Transcontinental railroad lines. 
(e) An abundance of raw materials which are needed in 
many countries. Make a list of the chief exports, and 
note to what countries they are sent. 
(f) Necessity for importing foodstuffs, textiles, and other 
products from warmer lands. Make a list of the chief 
imports, and note from what countries they are sent.

9. Could many more persons find homes and employment 
in Canada? 
Summary of problem. In one wide column, sum up all 
the reasons you can find for the present sparsity of popula- 
tion in Canada. In a second column, sum up all your reasons 
for thinking whether or not Canada can take care of a much 
larger population. 
Children’s activities. What the children can do to make 
Canada more real to them. 
1. Organization of tourist parties. The children are 
divided into three groups. One group plans a trip from its 
home town through the Canadian Rockies to the Pacific 
coast. The second group takes a journey by boat down the 
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. A third, with 
a thirst for adventure, canoes down the Mackenzie River 
to the far north. Each group, after providing itself with 
railroad and steamboat maps and folders, pictures, books 
of travel, etc., selects its own routes, schedules the cities 
visited, describes places of scenic or historic interest on the 
way. . 
2. Dramatizations. (a) A scene in a trading post of the 
Hudson’s Bay Company when the Indians come up with 
pelts. The agent receives and examines the pelts and gives 
in exchange merchandise from his stores. 
(b) A simple pageant may be worked out by the children 
in which they symbolize different parts of the country: 
the Wheat Lands, the Fruit Lands of the Southeast, the Fur 
Regions, the Forest Lands, the Land of the Eskimo, the 
Fishing Grounds, the Mining Lands, etc. 
(c) A list of ten leading cities is made. From these cities, 
each child chooses one to represent, so that the others may 
guess the one he has taken. 
8. Oral reports on such topics as (a) a maple-sugar camp, 
(6) my trip through the big woods, (c) a summer in the 
Klondike, (e) life on a wheat farm in Manitoba, (f) a hunt- 
ing lodge in Quebec, (g) fur farming. 
4. Booklets, with cover page decorated with a maple- 
leaf design.

  UNIT 7. MEXICO 
Time required: 2 weeks 
Introduction. 
1. Items of current interest about Mexico. 
2. Mexicans we know in our country. What are they 
like? What is their work? (On the railroad; in the beet 
fields; in truck gardens; in mines; etc.) 
8. Mexican articles in our homes: pottery, baskets, 
drawn work, souvenirs of travel. 
4. Raw materials Mexico furnishes to the United States: 
chicle for chewing gum, fiber for binder twine, rubber, 
cabinet woods, etc. 
5. Travelers’ accounts of Mexico. 
6. Stories of early days in Mexico; the Aztecs; the 
Spanish Conquest. 
Finding the problem. 
1. Why do so many Mexicans leave home and come to 
the United States? 
2. Why are many American business men interested in 
Mexico? 
3. Is Mexico an attractive country for people who are 
seeking new homes? 
4. Is Mexico as progressive as Canada? 
Let us select the last question for our problem, because 
it will help us the better to understand our nearest neigh- 
bors and the conditions under which they live. A fuller 
statement of the problem is: We hear more about Canadians 
and whai. they are doing in the world than about Mexicans. 
Is Mexico less progressive than Canada? Why? 
What does the map tell us concerning the location of 
Mexico? 4 
Mexico is in the narrowest part of the continent. 
It is nearly all south of the 30th parallel. 
It is crossed midway by the Tropic of Cancer. 
It extends over 17 degrees of latitude. 
It is largely on a highland. 
108 SEN CORO
-P-A-G-E-115
  UNIT 7. MEXICO 109 
6. It faces the widest part of the Pacific Ocean. 
7. It has very few islands around it. 
8. Except the United States, most of the neighboring 
countries are unimportant. 
9. Its northern part is in the horse-latitude belt. 
10. It is far from Europe and from the densely peopled 
part of North America. (Estimate the distance from 
Chicago to Mexico City; New York to Vera Cruz; Liver- 
pool to Vera Cruz.) 
Make similar inferences in regard to Canada, and draw 
conclusions as to which country is the more favorably 
located. 
What does the map tell us concerning the surface features 
of Mexico and their arrangement? Mexico is something 
like a stile, or set of steps, between the Gulf of Mexico and 
the Pacific Ocean. Make a diagram to show the general 
arrangement of highlands and lowlands from east to west. 
The following will illustrate a simple plan of a cross section. gots

ing crops, (e) a city found here, (f) minerals, (g) other 
facts of interest found in your textbooks. 
What does the map tell us concerning the climate. of 
Mexico? 
1. Mexico is in low latitudes, where the noon sun is high 
in the sky the year round. There would then be no winter 
season, except in the highlands or in the extreme north. 
2. Mexico is largely in the trade-wind belt. The trades 
blow over the Gulf of Mexico to reach this country, and so 
would be rain-bringing winds. The air of the trades would 
rise on the east side of the stile. Effect on rainfall? It 
would descend on the west side of the stile. Effect on rain- 
fall? 
8. The horse latitudes cross the northern part of Mexico. 
Effect of this belt of settling air on rainfall? 
4. The high plateau that extends from the United States 
to a point south of Mexico City would probably be much 
cooler than the coastal lowlands. 
5. Consult the rainfall map of North America. Discover 
what part of Mexico has less than 20 inches of rain. Are 
the larger cities in this part? Where are the areas of heaviest 
rainfall? Why there? Is Canada more fortunate as regards 
rainfall? 
6. Consult a map showing the isotherms, or temperature 
lines, which cross Mexico and Canada. (Atwood: New 
Geography, page 268.) We have learned that the people who 
live near the January isotherm of 30 degrees and the July 
isotherm of 68 degrees are usually very energetic. Which 
of the two countries is the more fortunately situated with 
regard to these temperature lines? 
7. Judging by the rainfall and isotherm maps, what 
crops could be grown in various parts of Mexico? How 
does your knowledge of crops in different parts of the 
United States help you in this? 
8. From the physical map and the rainfall map, find parts 
of the country (a) too rough for farming, (6) too wet for 
farming, (c) too dry for farming. 
Which seems more favorable to the development of an

area — a lowland in the central part, or a highland? Com- 
pare Mexico and Canada in arrangement of surface features. 
From a study of the physical map of Mexico and your 
diagram, judge the following: 
The length, character, and usefulness of the rivers. 
Difficulties in railroading. 
Parts of the country which could not be easily reached. 
The best step of the stile on which to live. 
The worst step of the stile on which to live. 
The number and character of the harbors. 
Reasons for the location of the four largest cities. 
Compare Mexico with Canada on each one of the seven 
points mentioned, and draw conclusions. 
The following figure facts (in round numbers) will help 
us in comparing the two countries: Noon we

Why are these facts significant in a comparison of countries? 
What conclusions do you draw from them? 
Problems within the problem. 
1. What kind of people live in Mexico? (About half are 
pure-blooded Indians. Many of the tribes are in the same 
stage of civilization as that which prevailed in Columbus’ 
time. Nearly one million people are whites, of European 
descent. The people speak many languages, but Spanish 
is the most common. There is little race prejudice.) Com- 
pare with races and peoples in Canada. 
2. How do the upper-class people live? (Homes, occupa- 
tions, customs, etc.) What do the common people do for 
a living? (Almost all depend on agriculture. Many work 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  112 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
on the large ranches, or estates, where they are virtually 
held as slaves. Often as many as 500 families live on one 
estate and work for the landowner. Wages are very low. 
The laborers, or peons, are not very efficient.) Is there a 
greater variety of occupations in Canada? Why? In 
which of the two countries are the conditions better for the 
workmen? 
3. What is the home life of the common people? 
(a) Houses. One-roomed huts of the peons, built of 
adobe, in the dry northern parts; of wood, with 
thatched roof, in the rainy parts. Little furniture 
— mats for beds, no tables or chairs, charcoal stove. 
(b) Dress. Men—coarse cotton trousers and jacket; 
huge hat, or sombrero; blanket, or serape; fiber 
sandals, woven or plaited. Women — coarse cotton 
dress; blue cotton scarf, or rebose. 
(ce) Food. Thin corn pancakes (tortillas), tomato sauce, 
beans, green peppers, melons, fruits. 
(d) Home occupations. Grinding corn, making tortillas, 
weaving cloth, making pottery, baskets, drawn work. 
(e) Amusements. Children’s games, as leap frog, etc., 
burro riding, horse racing, bullfighting, cockfighting. 
(f) Schools. Few, and very poorly attended. 
Compare with home life of common people in Canada, and 
draw conclusions. 
4. Is Mexico as well provided as Canada with routes of 
travel? 
(a) Waterways. Compare with Canada in use of rivers 
and lakes. 
(6) Railroads. Account for the location of the following 
lines: the road from border of United States to 
Mexico City; the road from Mexico City to Vera 
Cruz and Tampico; the road from Mexico City to 
Manzanillo; the road across the Isthmus of Te- 
huantepec. 
Why are seaports and railroads not found in Lower 
California?
-P-A-G-E-119
UNIT 7. MEXICO 113 
5. What minerals are found in Mexico which might 
contribute to her industrial progress? 
(a) Oil fields, near Vera Cruz and Tampico. Importance 
of location, output of wells, foreign investments in, 
etc. 
(b) The mineral region on the plateau. 
Compare with Canada’s coal, iron, gold, asbestos, petro- 
leum, etc. 
6. Could Mexico develop more manufactures? What is 
necessary for the development of manufacturing? Are 
these conditions found here? 
(a) Raw material (cotton, jute, rubber, sisal, hides, wool, 
timber, etc.). 
(b) Power to run the engines: coal, oil, water power. 
Amount and availability. 
(c) Cheap labor, with some degree of skill. 
(d) Transportation facilities. 
(e) Ready markets. 
Compare Mexico and Canada in regard to the present 
development of their manufactures. 
7. With almost twice the population of Canada, Mexico 
has less than one fourth of its foreign trade. What are some 
reasons for this? 
(a) What has Mexico to sell? (See world map of trade 
routes, in your textbook.) Are these raw materials 
as much in demand as the raw materials which 
Canada sells? 
(6) What does Mexico buy from other countries? From 
the United States: iron pipes, cloth, flour, sugar, 
automobiles, shoes, lumber, tires, canned salmon, 
paper, railway cars, plows, steel rails, typewriters, 
ete. Study each item to discover reasons why Mexico 
must buy these articles from a foreign country. 
Could she manufacture some of them for herself? 
8. Why are there so few large cities in Mexico? Compare 
with Canada. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  114 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
9. Does Mexico’s government take care of her people 
as well as Canada’s? 
10. If you were a Mexican, what would you be most 
proud of in your country? What would you strive hardest 
to improve? 
11. What can the United States do to help her weaker 
neighbor? 
Children’s activities. 
1. In two columns, headed respectively Mexico and 
Canada, record points in which each is superior, and thus 
keep a score of the two countries, which will be a summary 
of your conclusions. 
2. Plan an automobile trip from your home to some 
point in Mexico. Trace the route on the highway map, 
schedule your dates at various stopping places, note the 
interesting sights on the road, ete. 
3. Different groups of children might dramatize selected 
events in Mexican life. The children should choose the 
event they wish to present and plan the simple costumes 
and the action needed. The following is a list which may 
be suggestive: 
(a) Grinding corn and making tortillas. 
(6) Scene in a city market. 
(c) A Christmas posada (festival). 
(d) Scenes on a coffee plantation. 
(e) Scenes on a banana plantation. 
(f) Scenes on a henequen (sisal hemp) plantation. 
4. Each child might select a topic for an oral report. 
Suggestive list: (a) the plaza, (b) the cathedral, (c) the 
pulque shop, (d) the water carrier, (e) a bullfight, (f) mak- 
ing drawn work, (g) how the peons live, (h) Yucatan, the 
Garden of Mexico, (i) Lower California, (j) irrigation in 
Mexico. 
5. Plan for a Mexican exhibit. Bring Mexican articles, 
pictures, clippings from magazines, post cards, ete. A com- 
mittee of children should receive these and arrange them 
on a table where they may be accessible to all. One child,
-P-A-G-E-121
    UNIT 7. MEXICO 115 
appointed as manager, gives an explanation of each article 
on exhibit to the rest of the class. 
6. Booklets on Mexico, containing items of interest se- 
lected and written up by the children. The cover page 
might be in the shape of a sombrero, or it might be decorated 
with drawings of a banana plant, a coffee plant, etc. 
7. Make a sand map of Mexico, and place on the map 
articles which indicate products from the various parts of 
the country — rubber, binder twine, chewing gum, cotton, 
chocolate, jute, wool, etc. (Write to the International 
Harvester Company, Chicago, for their attractive booklet, 
“ Binder Twine.”)

  UNIT 8. THE DEPENDENCIES OF THE 
UNITED STATES 
Time required: About 2 weeks 
This unit provides for a comparative study of the four 
largest possessions of the United States, using the Hawaiian 
Islands as a base. 
Finding the starting point. 
1. What the islands furnish us: sugar, pineapples, ete. 
2. What Hawaii makes us think of: the ukelele, plaintive 
music, surf riding, volcanoes, ete. 
8. Travelers’ accounts; movies we have seen; stories 
we have read. 
Reading the map. Use the globe, the world map, and a 
detail map of the islands. 
On the globe and the world map, I can find these islands 
most easily by tracing the Tropic of Cancer west from Mexico: 
the Hawaiians are just a little south of the tropic. That 
tells me that they are in the trade-wind belt, and that they 
will have a high noon sun all the year round. Measuring 
with a string, I find that they are over 2000 miles from 
San Francisco or Los Angeles; over 4500 miles from Pan- 
ama; nearly 3500 miles from Yokohama; and almost 5000 
miles from Hongkong. 
The group of islands makes me think of a horn, with the 
little end pointing northwest. The largest island, Hawaii, 
is at the big end of the horn. From the physical map I 
can see that the islands are mountainous; there is very 
little lowland about them. Honolulu, the largest city, is 
not on the largest island, but is on the southeast side of 
Oahu. 
Finding the problem. The teacher suggests that some 
people think these islands are the most important possession 
of the United States. It will be interesting to compare our 
dependencies in several ways and see why Hawaii ranks 
so high. Let us select Alaska, the Philippines, and Porto 
Rico for this comparison.

Alaska, 590,000; Philippines, 115,000; Hawaii, 6500; 
Porto Rico, 3600. 
2. Comparison in population. Alaska, about  one- 
twentieth million; Philippines, ten millions; Hawaii, one- 
fourth million; Porto Rico, over one million. 
Judging by these figure facts, which seems the most im- 
portant? There are other ways of comparing places besides 
using figure facts. The class might divide into four groups, 
each group to study intensively one of the four possessions 
and to make reports to the rest of the class on their findings. 
Suggest that each group read the map carefully and write 
down the best map facts they find. They can use these in the 
debate that is sure to arise when the comparison becomes 
more definite. No doubt each group will become strongly 
partisan; this will motivate the study by giving a spirit of 
competition to the reports. The children will be very eager 
to suggest the points of comparison they would like to use, 
and will probably plan a simple outline, such as the following: 
Is this dependency a good place for white people to live? 
Does it produce things we need, but cannot get at home? 
Is it well located to be a coaling station? Would it be useful 
in time of war? Does it cost more to keep the dependency 
than it is worth? Would it be dangerous to us if some other 
world power owned the dependency? What kind of people 
live there? Do they need our help? What do they do fora 
living? Are there railroads there? good seaports? oppor- 
tunities for inter-island trade? Is the dependency on or near 
important commercial routes? Is it too far from great 
markets to meet competition of other areas, better situated, 
which produce much the same things? Has it coal or oil? 
What is the chance for water power? Are there valuable 
forests? Are manufactures well developed, or do they 
export most of their raw material? Is the dependency self- 
supporting; that is, does it furnish most of its food and
-P-A-G-E-124
118 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
material for clothing? Are its products largely luxuries, 
or are they necessaries? Can the people govern themselves? 
What is their education? Are they energetic? Are there 
race problems? How do the different races get along to- 
gether? Is there much good farming land here? Are the 
climate and the scenery attractive to tourists? Does the 
dependency import much from the United States? Could 
the area support a larger population? 
Each group should select two important products of its 
area and give a complete report on them. The Hawaiian 
group would probably choose Sugar and Pineapples; the 
Philippine group, Manila hemp and Copra; Porto Rico, 
Sugar, Coffee, Tobacco, or Fruit; Alaska, Fish, Furs, Min- 
erals, or Lumber. 
Some dramatizations would be effective in convincing 
the others that your dependency is the best. Select events | 
in the life of your area, and represent them by pantomime 
and by dialogue. If you could collect articles and pictures 
for an exhibit, it would help the other groups to understand 
just how important your area is. Have each member of 
your group give a short talk, explaining certain parts of 
the exhibit.

  UNIT 9. SOUTH AMERICA 
Time required: 6 or 8 weeks 
Seeing the continent as a whole. 
1. Introduction. (a) Review Panama Canal and _ its 
effect on our trade routes. (b) Note well-known products 
of South America in our stores. (c) Persons we know who 
have been in South America. (d) History stories about the 
continent. | 
2. Location. Latitude and longitude. How will the 
wide range in latitude affect the variety of products in 
South America? Note its easterly position as compared with 
North America. Name bordering waters. Estimate dis- 
tance from Europe, Africa, Asia, North America. 
3. Form. On paper, 9”x12", place the equator, the 
Tropic of Capricorn, the meridians of 40° and 80° west longi- 
tude. With these as guide lines, sketch in the continent. 
Practice till the child works rapidly and fairly accurately. 
Compare in shape and number of indentations and 
projections with North America. Which continent has 
the better coast line for the development of commerce? 
Drill in quick identification of the following: The mouths 
of the Amazon, the Orinoco, and the La Plata rivers; the 
Gulf of Guayaquil, Rio de Janeiro Bay, Gulf of Panama, 
Straits of Magellan, with the islands of Tierra del Fuego; 
Cape Horn, Cape St. Roque. 
4. Islands. Call attention to islands near South America: 
Galapagos, Falkland, Trinidad, Juan Fernandez. There is 
something of special interest about each. What is it? 
Describe the fiords of southern Chile. Where in North 
America are there fiorded coasts? 
5. Natural regions. Locate on outline map and model 
on sand map the following natural regions; Andes Moun- 
tains and plateaus, the highlands of Brazil-and Guiana, the 
lowlands of the Orinoco, the Amazon, and the Parana. 
Nors. Describe, as you model, the high, rugged, snow-covered Andes, 
with passes as high as the highest peaks of Colorado. Then buildgin the low, 
| 120

  UNIT 9. SOUTH AMERICA 121 
rounded peaks of the highlands of Brazil and of Guiana, calling attention 
to their importance as divides. Have the children make inferences as to the 
effect of the highlands on temperature. Picture the Wanos as very flat and 
grass-covered in the rainy season; the selvas, as equally flat, but densely 
forested; the pampas as grassy plains. Ask the children to find in their 
reference books interesting statements regarding each natural region. Use 
these in describing imaginary journeys through the continent. 
Compare the central plains of this continent with the Central Plains of 
North America; the Atlantic highlands with the Appalachian; the Andean 
highland with the Western highland of North America. Is the arrangement 
of highlands and lowlands favorable to the development of the continent? 
In which natural region do you think you would prefer to live? 
With thin strips of paper, represent on a sand map the equator, Tropic 
of Capricorn, 30th parallel, 40th parallel, 50th parallel, and the 60th meri- 
dian. Judge latitude and longitude of relief features named. Compare 
with North America as to corresponding parallels. 
Reading the physical map of South America. After the 
sand map has been completed and discussed, and a sketch 
map of the continent is ready for the notebooks, turn to 
the best physical maps in the textbook, and ask the children 
to tell all the map facts they can find. They are now ready 
to read such a map intelligently, because they can bring to 
the map reading the thoughts and experiences gained from 
the modeled map and its description. 
Some map facts the children will find. The Andean 
highland is not so wide as the Western highland of North 
America. It is widest in Bolivia. That reminds me of the 
way the North American highland bulges to the east in 
Colorado. The Eastern highland of South America is in 
two parts, separated by the wide Amazon Valley. The 
corresponding highland in North America is cut in two by 
the narrow Mohawk Valley. South America has a central 
plain extending from north to south. There is no chain of 
Great Lakes in the central plains of South America, as 
there is in North America. The Amazon River reminds me 
of the St. Lawrence; the Parana reminds me of the Mis- 
sissippi. I wonder if they lead into a central plain as im- 
portant as ours in North America. 
There is not so wide an Atlantic coastal plain in South 
America as in North America. The rivers on the west slope
-P-A-G-E-128
  122 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
of the Andean highland are short; I think they would not be 
navigable. Chile, like California, has a long central valley. 
I wonder if it is as busy a place as the Great Valley of 
California? The coast of southern Chile reminds me of 
Alaska. Railroading would be easy in the pampas and 
Ilanos. There are few good harbors along the Pacific coast. 
Most of the large cities are found along the border of the 
continent. I wonder why? 
Climate. Simplify the following study, if you find the 
class is not ready for it.

1. Zones. Much of the continent lies in the torrid zone. 
This may be defined as a belt in the equatorial region where 
the noon sun is straight above the heads of the people at 
some time throughout the year. It is bounded by the 
tropics. Make clear the fact that the sun is never straight 
above our heads in the temperate zone; therefore, we do 
not (on an average) receive so much heat from it directly 
as the people who live in the tropics. Illustrate by calling 
the child’s attention to the position of the sun in the morning 
and at noon, and the consequent difference in heat received. 
Note the proportion of the continent in the torrid and 
temperate zones. In Argentina, to get to a warmer region, 
do you travel south or north? The seasons are reversed in 
the south temperate zone; the school children of Chile have 
their long vacation in January and February, because that 
is the hot summer season. How will this difference in
-P-A-G-E-129
    UNIT 9. SOUTH AMERICA 128 
seasons help South America to find markets for her produce 
in northern continents? 
2. Winds. The position of the sun with regard to a 
given place determines the amount of heat received directly; 
however, the circulation of the atmosphere helps to deter- 
mine the distribution of that heat. Therefore, we must 
understand in what general direction the air is moving, in 
order to infer the climate of a given place. 
Review the lessons on Air in the primary grades, noting: 
air, when warmed, rises from the earth; rising air soon 
cools; cooling air gives up some of its load of water; cool 
air settles to the earth; the earth warms the air which 
settles toward it; warming air takes up water; belts where 
air rises or settles are calms. 
With these principles in mind, explain the scheme of 
world winds. Recall what is already known about the winds 
of North America. 
(a) Doldrum belt. Warm, calm, rainy. Why? 
(6) Anti-trade winds. (Upper air winds, moving poleward 
from the equator, with a bend to the east, because of rota- 
tion of earth.) 
(c) Horse-latitude belts. Located about at the parallels 
of 30 degrees north and south. Calm, dry. Why? Why 
called horse latitudes? Trace these parallels on the globe, 
and discover that many deserts are located-along-or near 
theni.— os am 
(d) Trade winds. Between horse latitudes and doldrums. 
Lower air winds. Steady and constant. Direction: equa- 
torward, with a bend to the west. The trades are blowing 
from a cooler to a warmer belt. Then, are trades usually 
taking away water, or are they bringing rain? Suppose the 
trades come to a highland — which is the windward and 
which the leeward side? Which side will receive rain? 
Why? On map of South America draw arrows to show 
where the northeast and southeast trades blow. As you 
draw, discuss whether trades are climbing highlands or 
descending slopes. Locate the Desert of Atacama in north- 
ern Chile, on the leeward side of the Andes.    
-P-A-G-E-130
  124 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
(e) Prevailing westerlies. From parallels of 30 degrees 
north and south, toward the poles. Bent or deflected 
eastward while moving poleward. Draw arrows, showing 
where the prevailing westerlies are found in South America. 
Which is the windward side of the Andes here? Then, 
which side will have little rainfall? Compare westerlies and 
trades as to regularity, and effect on temperature and 
rainfall. 
Norz. While the world winds must be taught as the prevailing system 
of atmospheric circulation over the globe, it should be very clearly stated 
that they are not prevalent over a large part of the Eastern Hemisphere. 
There the great continent of Eurasia causes a continental circulation which 
interferes with the world winds. Any further explanation of continental 
circulation should be deferred till the continent of Asia is studied in the 
junior high school. 
Additional drill questions. Trace the doldrum belt in 
South America. What great river is within it? This is the 
largest river in the world. Can you see one reason why? 
Why is this belt usually forested? 
The doldrum belt shifts northward in our summer. How 
would this affect the llanos? In our winter the doldrum belt 
shifts south again, and trade winds blow over the Ilanos. 
What effect will these have? Would you expect to find 
great forests here? 
The Gulf of Guayaquil and its neighboring lands are said 
to be the most unhealthful places in South America. Why? 
How do the highlands of South America make the wind 
belts irregular? 
Trace a journey by water from New York to the Straits 
of Magellan, noting wind belts traveled through and weather 
conditions to be expected. Would you prefer to go through 
the straits (a very dangerous passage) from the east or 
from the west? Why? 
Nore. Dramatize the world winds as follows: Draw east-west lines on 
the floor to represent the equator and the 30th parallels; and dots to 
represent the North and South poles. Place four children at the equator, 
two facing south and two north, back.to back. Let them move toward 
the 30th parallels, angling a little to the east. These are anti-trade winds
-P-A-G-E-131
       UNIT 9. SOUTH AMERICA 125 
of the upper air. Have two children continue poleward, one to the North 
Pole and one to the South Pole, still angling to the east. These are pre- 
vailing westerlies. The other two, who stopped at the 30th parallels, now 
turn about and move toward the equator, bending to the west. These are 
trades. Remind the children that the air rises at the equator, and settles 
at the 30th parallels, so making belts of calms. Let them tell what the 
effects will be as to rainfall. With three bold lines in a triangle, represent 
South America on the floor, in its proper location as to the equator and the 
80th parallel. Now have children represent the trades and westerlies again, 
and discuss their effects. Locate the Andean highland, and discuss its 
windward and leeward sides, judging rainfall in different places. 
Make a rainfall map of South America for your notebook. 
Print in the names of important plant products as you 
find them. 
1. Turn to the population map of the continent. Com- 
paring it with your sketch map of the surface features, and 
your rainfall map, determine why some areas are densely 
settled, while many others have a sparse population. 
2. Judging by the location, the surface features, and the 
climate, what are the chief differences between South 
America and North America? What reasons can you find 
why South America has not developed a nation that is a 
world power? 
What kind of people live in South America? 
1. Indians. (Bowman: South America; A Geography 
Reader. See race map, op. cit., page 317. Bryce: South 
America. Ross: South of Panama.) (a) The wild Indian 
tribes of the Amazon Valley and of Patagonia. What 
reasons can you find why the people of these areas are lowest 
in civilization of all the native tribes? How do they live? 
What do they look like? What is their work? their educa- 
tion? Do they have a voice in the government? (6) Civil- 
ized Indians, more than half of whom live in Peru and 
Bolivia. This was also the home of the ancient Incas, the 
most highly civilized Indians ever known. Can you find 
some reasons, judging by the character of the area, why it 
encouraged a complex civilization? Where, in North 
America, was the highest type of native Indian found? 
What fraction of the entire South American population    
-P-A-G-E-132
    
  126 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
  is Indian? What countries have the highest per cent? 
Why the northern lands? The native Indians, when South 
America was discovered, were mainly agricultural; compare 
with the fierce nomadic tribes found in North America by 
early settlers. Could such Indians be forced to do the work 
of the settlers? In South America the Indians were prac- 
tically enslaved. How did this affect the history of the 
two continents? 
2. Negroes. Nearly all of these are in Brazil. Why? 
What is their work? (In rubber forests, on coffee planta- 
tions, etc.) 
8. Mizxed races. These make up about one third of the 
population. Is there any race or color prejudice in South 
America? 
4. Whites. (About one fourth of the population.) Por- 
tuguese, in Brazil; Spanish; Italian; German; and other 
Europeans. Why are Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and 
Brazil the white man’s countries? 
5. Japanese and other Asiatics. Why do they come to 
South America to live? What work can they do? 
What languages are most common here? What religion? 
What per cent of illiteracy do you find? Are schools provided 
for all? What are some of the customs of the people? 
What characteristics of the people are favorable to the 
development of their continent? What hinder its develop- 
ment? 
What South America furnishes to the world. 
1. Coffee. (Allen: Industrial Studies: South America. 
Bowman: South America; A Geography Reader, pages 217- 
224. Carpenter: New Geographical Reader: South America, 
pages 293-301. Chamberlain: The Continents and Their 
People: South America.) Where are the coffee areas? On 
the map, find Sao Paulo, in Brazil—the center of the 
industry. Is it on a plain or in the highlands? From rain- 
fall map, find the rainfall of the area. What does the tem- 
perature map tell you about Sao Paulo? Find other coffee 
areas (the highlands of Colombia, etc.). What part of the 
world’s coffee is grown in Brazil?      
-P-A-G-E-133
    UNIT 9. SOUTH AMERICA 127 
In your reference books, find a good description of the 
coffee plant. In what kind of soil does it grow best? How 
is coffee planted? cultivated? Can coffee stand frost? How 
long a growing Season does it need? Why are so many 
workers needed in the month of May? Describe a visit to 
a coffee plantation. Tell how the berries are picked, sorted, 
and dried. What kind of people do the work? Is much 
hand labor required? By what routes is coffee shipped to 
our country? 
2. Rubber. What uses of rubber can you name? What 
part of your telephone equipment is made of rubber? What 
are some important rubber manufacturing cities in the 
United States? Why does our country lead in the manu- 
facture of rubber? 
Locate the raw rubber regions of South America. What 
conditions are necessary for rubber-yielding forests? Why 
is the doldrum belt favorable? Are rubber trees all of one 
species? Are the trees numerous in the jungle? What kind 
of people gather the liquid rubber (latex)? How do they 
tap the trees and collect the latex? How is this liquid 
hardened for shipping? How are the biscuits or slabs taken 
to the port (at Manaos or Para)? Describe the living con- 
ditions of the rubber gatherers. 
Is wild rubber now the chief resource of the rubber manu- 
facturers? Where are the world’s rubber plantations? 
Why in southern Asia and adjacent islands rather than in 
Brazil? (More healthful climate; dependable labor; 
European management.) 
3. Chocolate (cacao). In how many ways do you use 
chocolate or cocoa? The Amazon Valley produces more 
cacao than any other area. Describe the cacao tree. How 
does the fruit grow on the tree? Why is a windy area not 
favorable for these trees? After the fruit is picked, how is 
it prepared for shipping? Describe the beans as they are 
received at the factory. How are they prepared for your 
use? 
4. Nitrate for fertilizer. What use of fertilizers do you 
know about? What materials for fertilizer are found in our
-P-A-G-E-134
128 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
country? What are imported? The whole world depends 
on Chile for nitrates. Where are the nitrate beds? Why 
found only in deserts? Tell how the nitrate is obtained 
(blasting the rock, loading the broken pieces on mule carts, 
the haul to the railroad; the nitrate works — dissolving the 
nitrate, evaporating, drying, sacking, shipping). How do 
nitrate workers live in the desert? What are their houses 
made of? Where do they get their food? their water? What 
are the ports from which nitrate is shipped? What countries 
are the greatest buyers of nitrate? 
Nitrate has other uses besides that of making fertilizer. 
What are they? Why was nitrate in demand during the 
World War? On the whole, why is nitrate the most valuable 
mineral in Chile? 
5. Meat and grain. In our country do we produce enough 
meat and grain to supply the demand? Find out if we im- 
port from South America. European trade with South 
America is much heavier than ours. Can you see some 
reasons for this? 
Recall the grain and live-stock regions in North America. 
What conditions favor these industries? After studying the 
maps of South America (physical, rainfall, railroad), decide 
where you would expect to find areas devoted to live stock. 
Will they be in the rainiest parts? the driest parts? among 
the jungle forests of the Amazon? in the rough lands of 
the Andes? in the hot, moist coastal lowlands? in the level 
valley of the Orinoco? In deciding on live-stock areas, why 
do you wish to know the latitude of each place? Why do 
you also look at the population map to help in your choice? 
Are you quite sure you can point out the best grass lands 
in the continent? Why do you look at the railroad map 
before you select live-stock areas? 
Describe the cattle lands of Argentina. (Allen: Industrial 
Studies: South America, pages 171-179. Bowman: South 
America; A Geography Reader, page 36.) Compare these 
with the High Plains of North America. Describe a cattle 
ranch (estancia) and the work of a cowboy (gaucho). 
How is the meat prepared for market? How is it shipped
-P-A-G-E-135
    UNIT 9. SOUTH AMERICA 129 
to foreign countries? To what countries is it shipped? To 
what countries are hides and wool shipped? Where are the 
meat-packing centers in South America? Compare Rosario 
and Chicago in location, transportation facilities, nearness 
to grain and live-stock regions, etc. 
Locate the corn and wheat belts in South America. Why 
does Argentina export much of her corn, while the United 
States keeps most of hers at home? Why does Argentina 
ship so much wheat? To what countries is it sent? 
6. Other products. South America also furnishes sugar, 
cotton, copper, diamonds, lumber. Brazil has the world’s 
greatest iron-ore field. Why is it not the center for steel 
manufacture? How has the coal shortage in South America 
affected industrial development? 
The countries of South America. The following prob- 
lems may suggest ways to investigate South American 
countries: 
1. The A. B. C. countries. Why is Argentina the most 
progressive country? Brazil, with an area greater than the 
United States, has a population less than one fourth that of 
the United States. What are some reasons for this? Chile 
may be called the California of South America. (Allen: 
Industrial Studies: South America, page 229.) Find out in 
what respects this is true. (Great length, central valley, 
mountainous background, variety in climate and products, 
few good ports, etc.) Score the two areas on these, and 
other points. 
2. The northern countries. What hindrances has Ecua- 
dor? What favorable conditions are found in Venezuela and 
Colombia? Why do European nations wish to own the 
Guianas? 
8. Central Andean countries. Why may Peru be called 
a white man’s country? Bolivia resembles Colorado and 
Utah in some points. What are they? 
4. Small countries of the plains. How is Paraguay like 
Florida? Why is Uruguay attractive to white settlers? 
(Pleasant climate, fertile soil, almost no waste land, no 
mountain barriers, natural grass and grain regions, navigable
-P-A-G-E-136
130 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
rivers, railroads, good harbor at Montevideo, population 
nearly all white, etc.) 
5. Some general problems. Why is manufacturing com- 
paratively unimportant in South America? What countries 
will probably develop manufacturing in the future? Why 
should the United States plan to increase’ her trade with 
South America? Can South America provide homes for 
overcrowded people of Europe and Asia? 
Suggestions for children’s activities. 
1. Talks and dramatizations. (a) A visit to a coffee plan- 
tation, (b) what the ancient Incas were like, (c) the wild 
Indians of Tierra del Fuego, (d) a trip up the Amazon 
River, (e) in the rubber forests, (f) my visit to the nitrate 
deserts, (g) on a ranch in Argentina, (h) the beautiful 
harbor of Rio de Janeiro, (i) where I should rather live in 
South America, (j) my choice of a travel route through 
South America. 
2. Debates. (a) That Brazil has more opportunities for 
advancement than Argentina, (b) that the character of the 
inhabitants has more to do with the slow development of 
South America than the physical conditions of the conti- 
nent, (c) that South America offers the best opportunities 
for young people, of all the undeveloped lands in the world. 
8. An exhibit. Collect samples of South American prod- 
ucts, pictures of scenes and events in South American life, 
etc. Label and arrange these in order; have ‘the children 
explain the exhibit to visitors, or to groups from other grades.

  UNIT 10. SEEING EUROPE AS A WHOLE 
Time required: 1 or 2 weeks 
Specific aims in the study of Europe. (a) To learn about 
the continent from which most of the settlers of America 
came, (b) to try to find out why the people of Europe 
developed the highest civilization in the world, (c) to com- 
pare Europe with America and thus be able to understand 
America better. 
Finding the starting point. 
1. Persons we know who have come from Europe. 
2. Articles in our homes made in Europe. _ 
8. Places in Europe from which our ancestors came. 
Location. A near neighbor to Africa and Asia, really a 
great peninsula from the continent of Asia. 
Problem. What are the advantages in the position of 
Europe? Suggested points: fronts the Atlantic — one of 
the great oceans of commerce; near other continents; none 
of it lies in the torrid zone; largely in the westerly wind 
belt, ete. 
Extent. Compare with South America and North 
America. 
Form. On paper, 9” x 12”, draw the Arctic Circle, the 
parallels of 40, 50, and 60 degrees north latitude, the prime 
meridian, and the meridians of 10 degrees west and 60 
degrees east longitude. With these as guide lines, sketch in 
the outlines of the continent. Drill in recognition of the 
following projections and indentations: peninsulas—Scan- 
dinavian, Iberian, Italian, Balkan, Danish, Crimean; in- 
dentations — North Sea, Baltic Sea, English Channel, Bay of 
Biscay, Tyrrhenian Sea, Adriatic Sea, AXgean Sea, Black 
Sea, White Sea, Caspian Sea. Surrounding islands: British, 
Iceland, Shetland, Balearic, Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, Crete. 
Problem. We found the islands around the two Americas 
rather unimportant. Why are the islands around Europe so 
much more important ? 
Draw the outline of the continent on the sand table; 
132 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  
UNIT 10. SEEING EUROPE AS A WHOLE = 133 
cover with sand, while drilling on the names listed above. 
Now discuss the differences in coast lines as you model, 
calling attention to Norway’s fiorded coast; to the low, 
shelving coasts of Denmark; to the steep wall-like coasts of 
northwestern France, with their few harbors; to the sand- 
dune coast along the Bay of Biscay, etc. 
With the Italian peninsula (about 850 miles long) as a 
unit of measurement, have the children estimate the length 
of (a) Great Britain, (6b) the Scandinavian peninsula, 
(c) the Caspian Sea, (d) the entire continent, etc. 
Surface. On the sand map build up and describe the 
following: Scandinavian Mountains, Pyrenees, Cantabrian 
Mountains, Alps, Apennines, Carpathians, Transylvanian 
Alps, Dinaric Alps, Balkan Mountains, Urals, Caucasus; 
locate the great central plain, the Hungarian plain, and 
the plain of Lombardy (the Po Valley). Note that the 
central plain widens eastward till it reaches from the White 
to the Black Sea. The Hungarian plain is almost square 
and is surrounded by mountains. The Lombardy plain 
is a wedge-shaped lowland between the Alps and the Ap- 
ennines. 
Now try to see the surface of the continent as a whole 
and to describe its pattern. This will help the children to 
recognize the natural regions: the northwest highland, the 
central plain, the southern uplands and plains. Compare 
the European pattern of surface features with simpler 
arrangement found in the Americas. 
After the slopes have been modeled, trace in the following 
rivers: Volga, Danube, Rhine, Rhone, Po, Vistula, Elbe, 
Thames, Garonne, Ebro, Tagus, Douro. Locate surface 
features in sketch map. 
Trace the southern limit of glaciation, and discuss the 
effects of glaciation on the central plain. 
Judge the latitude and longitude of the relief features 
named above. What places in North America are in the 
same latitudes? 
Problems. 
1. The highlands of the two Americas extend north and
-P-A-G-E-140
  
134 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
south, while the great highland of Europe extends east and 
west. What are some effects of this arrangement of high- 
lands in Europe? 
2. Are the central plains of Europe as important to the 
continent as the Central Plains of North America? 
Climate. Review world winds. Trace on sketch map of 
Europe arrows showing direction of the prevailing westerly 
winds. 
The westerlies have been blowing over the ocean. Recall 
that ocean water is warmer than the land in winter and 
cooler than the land in summer. Then what effect will 
these winds have on western Europe? 
The world winds help to cause surface streams on the 
ocean, called ocean currents, and these affect the tempera- 
ture of the air above them. On an outline map of the world, 
trace the North Atlantic equatorial drift. Begin at the 
westernmost point of Africa, tracing the current westward, 
almost parallel with the equator, and noting that the north- 
east trades give direction to this drift or slow movement. 
The current is interrupted in its westward flow by the east 
coast of South America; it then swings northward, a part 
curving into the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, emerging 
at the Florida Strait; part making a short circuit east of 
the West Indies and joining the longer circuit along the east 
Florida coast. The current has now crossed the 30th 
parallel. It is in what wind belt? Then what will be its 
direction? What is its name now? As the Gulf Stream 
moves eastward, toward Europe, it widens out like a fan and 
then slowly drifts back toward the African coast. Is the 
water of the Gulf Stream warmer or colder than the sur- 
rounding ocean water? Then what effect will it have on 
the westerlies which blow over it to Europe? 
Examine an isotherm map of Europe. Why do the 
isotherms bend to the south after leaving the Atlantic 
coast? Do temperatures vary more from north to south, 
or from east to west, in Europe? Discover that distance 
from the La is more important than latitude in deter- 
mining the temperature of places in Europe. Compare
-P-A-G-E-141
UNIT 10. SEEING EUROPE AS A WHOLE 185 
with the isotherm map of North America. Are places on 
the 60th parallel in North America as warm as those in 
Europe on that parallel? How about the 40th and 50th? 
Account for the difference. 
Make a rainfall map of Europe, using symbols as for 
North America. Compare rainfall of the British Isles and 
of the Caspian Sea area; of Scandinavian and Iberian pen- 
insulas; of central France and central Russia; etc. Account 
for differences. What would be the effect on the distribu- 
tion of rainfall in Europe if a great mountain chain, like the 
Rockies, extended along western Europe? Has Europe as 
much desert land as North America or South America? 
Would this help to account for the high civilization found 
here? 
Countries. 
1. Leading countries. Britain, France, Italy, Germany, 
Russia. 
2. Other countries. Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, 
the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, 
Jugo-Slavia, Czecho-Slovakia, Bulgaria, Austria, Hungary, 
Greece, Poland, Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Albania, 
the Ukraine. 
8. Small independent countries. Andorra, Monaco, Lux- 
emburg, San Marino. 
Which of these have natural boundaries? Which have 
long frontier lines without natural defense? 
Problem. North America is divided into a few large 
countries, while Europe is divided into many small ones. 
Give some reasons for this. 
Soviet Russia is the largest country of Europe, and the 
Ukraine is next in rank. France and Spain are about the 
same size, each being nearly three times as large as the state 
of Missouri. The United Kingdom, Rumania, Norway, 
Finland, Poland, Jugo-Slavia, and Italy might be placed 
in the same class — each not quite twice as large as Missouri. 
With the exception of Germany and Sweden, the other 
European countries are smaller than Missouri. 
Reading the map of Europe. Be sure the children under-  
-P-A-G-E-142
  136 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
stand the symbols used on the maps they are reading. 
Then expect them to get real thought. 
Map facts children suggest. Maps used: physical, po- 
litical, rainfall, population, temperature. 
Europe has the most peninsulas of any continent. It is 
cut into by many seas. It has many little fenced-in places. 
I wonder if that is why there are so many countries. It has 
many islands around it. Its highlands are not continuous, 
like the Western highland of the Americas, but are cut into 
different parts. The highlands bulge northward in Germany, 
until they make the plain there quite narrow. I find two 
long routes through the highlands, where the Rhone and 
the Danube have cut through. That makes me think of 
the Hudson-Mohawk Valley through the Appalachians. 
Europe has more plains than highlands. It would be easy 
to build railroads on the plains, running from the Pyrenees 
Mountains clear to the Urals in Russia. Europe has many 
rivers. I think those on the plains would be navigable. 
The seas on the north and northwest are shallow; those on 
the south are deep. By the rainfall map, most of western 
Europe has plenty of rain. Eastern Europe, like western 
North America, has areas where the rain is scanty. The 
population map tells me that the densest areas are in the 
western half of the central plains. The area of fewest people 
is in the north. Europe’s belt of dense population is farther 
north than the belt in our continent. I notice that the part 
of the central plains that is narrowest has a very dense 
population. When I look at the temperature and rainfall 
maps, I find that the western part of the central plains is 
favorably located.

UNIT 11. THE BRITISH ISLES 
Time required: About 4 weeks 
Finding the starting point. Ask the children to find out 
if any of their ancestors lived in the British Isles. If possible, 
tell just where they lived, and point out the places on the 
map. Recall interesting items of history. Mention all the 
famous men and women you can think of who lived there: 
kings, queens, writers, soldiers, musicians, statesmen, etc. 
No doubt the list will include Alfred the Great, Queen 
Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots, Queen Victoria, Crom- 
well, Gladstone, Lloyd George, Nelson, Kitchener, Walter 
Raleigh, Shakespeare, Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Rob- 
ert Bruce, and many others. Test the children’s reading 
by mentioning British authors, as Dickens, Daniel DeFoe, 
Lewis Carroll, R. L. Stevenson, Kipling, etc. Many of 
our best-known songs, poems, stories are from the British 
Isles. Can you name some? Find out what articles used 
in our everyday life came to us from Britain (some of our 
linen and woolen goods, cutlery, etc.). Perhaps your dry- 
goods merchant can suggest other goods which he imports 
from Britain. 
Reading the map. These islands are in shallow water 
and are not far from the continent. The coast line is very 
irregular; some of the largest indentations are in pairs, 
opposite each other, as the Firth of Forth and the Firth of 
Clyde; the Bristol Channel and the Wash. These make the 
island very narrow in places. Northern Scotland is all 
highland; then comes a belt of lowland, which has the two 
big cities, Edinburgh and Glasgow; south of that is another 
highland. I should expect to find the densest population 
in the lowland belt. England has much more plain than 
Scotland; I notice that the English plains contain more 
cities than the highlands. Wales is all highland. Ireland 
is lowland in the middle, and high around the edges. The 
Scotch coast looks like the coast of Maine: many narrow 
bays, and islands. I think it must be a fiorded coast. These 
138

    UNIT 11. THE BRITISH ISLES 139 
islands are in about the same latitude as Labrador. I 
wonder if the climate is as severe. I notice so many rail- 
roads on the English plain; it has many large cities, too. 
Judging by the scale of miles, Great Britain is about 700 
miles long. 
Some interest centers. I should like to find out all I 
can about London. I am interested in Oxford University 
because I know a Rhodes scholar. I should like to find out 
about the big cathedrals, Canterbury and others. I should 
like to know about Windsor Castle and other places where 
kings and queens live. How did it happen that these little 
islands became so important? Why do so many people live 
here? I should like to know about the places where famous 
persons have lived: Stratford and Shakespeare, Ayr and 
Robert Burns, Edinburgh and Sir Walter Scott, London 
and Charles Dickens, ete. Why do they have so many 
cotton mills, when they have to import all the cotton? How 
do they dig peat in Ireland? Why does Ireland raise so 
many potatoes? 
An outline for one of the interest centers. What are 
some of the conditions that have made Britain great? 
1. The kind of people who live there. Discuss the charac- 
teristics of English, Scotch, and Irish people — energy, 
ambition, determination, courage, pride, business ability, 
statesmanship, loyalty, love of liberty, ability to govern 
-other peoples and races. Find other traits which seem to 
explain why this little group of islands, not so great in area 
as California, could become so influential. What events in 
history reveal some of these traits? Are the people well 
governed? What freedom has Ireland? 
Find out about the schools in Britain. What per cent of 
the people cannot read and write? Are the people physically 
strong? Find the density of population per square mile; 
compare with that of the United States. Imagine some 
conditions of living in an overcrowded land like England. 
Over 80 per cent of the people live in cities; one fifth of 
the entire population is crowded into London and its environ- 
ments. Think what a land of city dwellers suggests as to 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
140 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
ways of making a living; housing; rules of sanitation; 
means of travel; need for playgrounds for children; sources 
of food; unemployment; beggary; etc. Would the young 
people have as many opportunities to get on in the world 
as you have? What can the adventure-loving do? 
Turn to the population map again, and find four areas 
of very dense population; two areas of sparse population. 
Some questions as to why these areas are so varied will at 
once occur to you. Answer them now, if you can; or wait 
until you have studied the climate, the surface, and the coal 
fields; then find reasons for the uneven distribution of 
population. 
2. The land they live in. 
(a) Area and location. Give the area, as compared with 
France, Germany, and with your home state. Discuss its 
location and advantages (seclusion without exclusion; pro- 
tection from invasion by land; located to the west of the 
continent; in the path of the westerlies; faces the smaller of 
the two great oceans; in high latitudes; surrounded by 
narrow, tidal seas; a neighbor to progressive nations; etc.). 
Find two disadvantages in location. In what respect is 
France better located? Find the sailing distance from 
Liverpool to New York; to Buenos Aires; to Singapore; to 
Hongkong; to Melbourne. Find water and rail distance from 
London to Paris; to Berlin; to Constantinople; to Odessa. 
Make a very simple sketch map of Great Britain and 
Treland; add an irregular line to show the adjacent coast 
line of Europe. 
(b) Climate. These islands are so far north that we might 
expect severe winters and very cool summers. Turn to the 
temperature map and look for the January and July iso- 
therms which cross the islands. Draw these lines on your 
sketch map, and place at their marginal ends the temperature 
in degrees. Now turn to a temperature map of North 
America and locate similar lines. Then make a statement 
about the winters and the summers in Britain. Why are 
they so mild? Where, in North America, do you find a 
similar climate? Read about climate in your textbooks to 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  UNIT 11. THE BRITISH ISLES 141 
verify your statements. Describe a winter in England. 
How would you dress if you were to spend a summer in 
Scotland? If you lived in London, would you use as much 
ice in summer and as much coal in winter as you do in 
America? 
Turn to the rainfall map and find areas where there is too 
much rain; sufficient rain. Explain how the westerlies are 
rain bringers. Why do they bring so much rain to Ireland 
and to northwestern Scotland? Can you account for the 
heavy fogs in Britain? What other fog areas do you think 
of? Judging by the temperature and rainfall, what crops 
could grow in these islands? Name some crops which grow 
in your home area which would not do well there, and tell why. 
Why do the Scotch eat so much oatmeal porridge? Why do 
the Irish eat so many potatoes? Where in England would 
you find apple orchards? Why are berries so delicious and 
so abundant in Britain? 
Does the climate help you to understand why the British 
people are so energetic? If the climate is so favorable for 
crops, why are not more persons farmers? 
(c) Coal supply. We have learned that a country needs 
coal, if it is to become great. Recall the immense coal fields 
of the United States. What is our yearly output of coal? 
Turn to a coal map of Britain (or Europe). Locate three 
coal fields, and name a large city near each. Are these coal 
fields near the coast? advantages? Locate the fields on 
your sketch map, by shading. In encyclopedias and other 
reference books, find out if British coal is high grade; if 
much of it is exported; what the yearly output is. Find 
a description of the work of a Welsh miner. Why is so much 
coal shipped out from Cardiff? 
Since the islands have a dense population of city dwellers, 
and there are great coal fields conveniently located for water 
shipment, you will expect to find much manufacturing. 
Make a list of all the manufactures you find mentioned in 
your textbook: after each, place the name of a city where 
the article is manufactured. Look on the map to see if these 
cities are near coal fields; if they are on navigable rivers.
-P-A-G-E-148
142 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
Now ask yourself some questions such as the following: 
How does coal help to make Britain great? If her coal 
supply should give out, could she continue to support so 
many people? What chance for water power is there? 
Treland is coal poor. Is Ireland as prosperous and influential 
as Great Britain? Suppose Ireland had had the coal beds 
instead of Great Britain, how might their history have been 
different? Can a country become a world power without 
having a good coal supply? How about Italy and Japan? 
Is Russia well supplied with coal? Spain? Germany? 
(d) Raw materials. We have seen that Britain has a 
dense population, a favorable location, an energizing climate, 
a good supply of coal, and extensive manufactures. Now 
we wonder where she gets the raw material for her industries. 
Look over your list of manufactures, and from it make a 
list of the raw materials used: cotton, wool, flax, copper, 
iron ore, clay, rubber, wood, ete. After each, write where it 
is produced. What neighboring countries add to Britain’s 
home supply of iron ore? of flax? How much wool does the 
home country furnish? Where does she get the rest? Name 
three sources of cotton; of copper. Does Britain have a 
tariff on such imports? 
Are you wondering why Britain ranks so high in manu- 
facturing, when so large a part of her raw materials must be 
brought in from outside? Why does she bring wool from 
Australia, for instance? How much of her raw materials 
comes from her own colonies? Why are British cotton manu- 
facturers so eager to encourage cotton growing in parts of 
Africa and Asia? To what countries does Britain sell her 
manufactures? Why do we not have more of her wares 
in our stores? Do the boats that carry manufactured goods 
to her colonies have a return cargo? What are some of 
these cargoes? 
From the Statesman’s Year-Book, encyclopedias, and other 
reference books, get a list of the five countries that are the 
biggest buyers of British goods; the five countries from 
which she imports most; the five leading imports and ex- 
ports; account for each. What is Britain’s rank as a manu- 
   
-P-A-G-E-149
UNIT 11. THE BRITISH ISLES 143 
facturing nation? Is there any danger that she might 
manufacture more than she can sell? Why is Britain so 
eager for peace on all seas? Why, then, does she keep so 
large a navy? Why does she build and own so many freight 
and passenger boats? Why has she gained so many colo- 
nies? 
Write a page or two telling how Britain gets raw materials 
for manufacturing. 
(e) Food. Can Britain furnish food enough for her 
crowded peoples? 
Here are some figure facts to show how much food is 
produced in the islands:

     Wheat... . 53 million bushels

  Yearty Propuction or Live Stock 1n Great Brivarn iw 1921 
    Cattle. . 12 millions

Sheep... eae 
  Wheat-eating countries demand about five bushels for 
every inhabitant. Then, how much wheat will it be neces- 
sary for Britain to import for her population? Why is so 
much barley grown here? Account for the high yield of 
oats. Judging by the live-stock population, can Britain 
furnish enough meat, milk, butter, and cheese? Does she 
produce any sugar? Would she need to import eggs? 
fruits? vegetables? Does she raise enough food for her 
live stock? 
Make a list of the foods that must be imported; after 
each write the countries from which it is imported. Do the 
British colonies furnish much food? Would you expect to 
find a heavy tariff on food imports? Is there any danger in 
having to depend on other lands for food? 
You notice that one food, fish, is exported. Read every-  
-P-A-G-E-150
  144 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
thing you can find about the fishing industry here; com- 
pare North Sea fishing with that on the Grand Banks. 
Give three reasons why the British seas are good fishing 
areas. 
Now let us find some reasons why Britain does not grow 
more food. Discover from the maps (physical, rainfall, 
temperature) what parts of the islands are suited to farming. 
What hinders farming in northern Scotland? in Wales? 
Where are there other highland areas? What parts have too 
much rain? Find out about how many farmers there are in 
Britain. (Probably Scotland and England have the fewest 
in the world, in proportion to their population.) About 
three fourths of England and Ireland are cultivable. Why 
is so much of this good land devoted to pasture? Do most 
farmers own the land they cultivate? Are the farms large? 
well improved? Find a good description of a farm home in 
Britain. Why do so few people wish to farm in this country? 
Judging by the heavy import of farm produce, would you 
expect the farmers to get a good price for their crops? _ 
Britain is famous for its breeds of domestic animals. 
Look closely at the place names on a good map of the 
British Isles, and see how many names of breeds of live 
stock you can find, as, for instance, Jersey, Guernsey, Shet- 
land, Berkshire, Yorkshire, Galloway, Hereford. As a rule, 
do you expect crowded lands to produce much live stock? 
What reasons can you find to explain why there are so many 
sheep and cattle here? why so few hogs? Suggest, from a 
study of the physical map, some sheep areas. 
Write a page telling about Britain’s food supply. 
(f) Transportation. Is Britain well supplied with rail- 
ways and waterways? 
A good way to judge es progress of a country is to find 
out about its roads and highways. Britain has over 23,000 
miles of railway. How many has your home state? How 
many has France? Perhaps no other country in the world 
is so well supplied with railroads as Britain. Notice on the 
map where the network of railways is thickest. What 
cities are railroad centers? Describe a passenger coach used 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
UNIT 11. THE BRITISH ISLES 145 
in Britain. Why are the freight cars so small? What rivers 
and canals are used for freighting? Does Britain have good 
roads throughout the country? Would easy means of travel 
help to keep a people united and loyal? 
Foreign commerce is necessary, or Britain would starve. 
Are there many good harbors? Name and locate eight 
seaports. Find reasons why London, Liverpool, Glasgow, 
and Cardiff are important. What British steamship lines 
can you name? The British build many ships. Why does 
Glasgow lead in shipbuilding? 
As a summary, tell how British transportation facilities 
have helped to make her great. 
(g) Britain’s dependencies. Could the British Isles have 
gained such high rank without their foreign possessions? 
Name and locate the larger dependencies. Then find some 
of the small islands and headlands which are points of 
approach or defense for the larger possessions, as, for in- 
stance, Gibraltar, Aden, Straits Settlements, the Windward 
Islands, etc. What colonies are practically independent? 
Why has Britain become a great colonizing nation? How 
do the colonies strengthen her? How did they respond to 
her need in the World War? 
Summary. After going over the topics mentioned in 
this outline, and many others which will occur to you, 
prepare a talk or a paper, telling why Britain has become so 
great. 
Suggestions for children’s activities. 
1. Talks or dramatizations. (a) A day in London, (b) a 
visit to Westminster Abbey, (c) the Lakes of Killarney, 
(d) in the Scotch Highlands, (e) a Lancaster cotton mill, 
(f) a Yorkshire woolen mill, (g) a scene at the Glasgow 
shipyards, (h) a motor trip through England, (i) why 
Britain and America should be friends. 
2. Debates. (a) That Britain has done more for the 
world than any other modern nation, (b) that Britain should 
do more to encourage farming, (c) that Britain’s greatness 
depends more on the kind of people she has than on the kind 
of land they live in.

UNIT 12. FRANCE 
Time required: 3 or 4 weeks 
Finding the starting point. The following topics may 
serve to introduce the study in informal discussion with the 
children, and thus to discover in the child’s everyday experi- 
ences some interests which could be used to lead him toward 
the area to be studied: 
1. Persons we know who have been in France, and what 
they tell us about the country. 
2. Articles in our homes which came from France: 
jewelry, perfume, Haviland china, silks, gloves, salad oil, 
stuffed olives, etc.; souvenirs which the soldiers brought 
back; ete. 
8. Any item of current or recent interest about France. 
4. French persons we know in this country, what they are 
like, and what they do for a living. 
5. Paris fashions. 
6. Stories of Lafayette, Joan of Are, Napoleon, etc. 
Choosing some interest centers. The following are 
typical of a child’s interest centers, as he states them himself: 
1. I should like to know what kind of a country France is. 
2. I never could see why the French held out so well in 
the war. 
Why are the French so proud of their country? 
Why don’t more Frenchmen come to America? 
Is France a good place in which to live? 
hs do so many pretty things come from France? 
I should like to know about Paris — what it is like? 
How can a little country like France have forty million 
people living there? 
9. Why have they done so much more than we to beautify 
their towns and cities? 
10. Why are there so many farmers in France? 
11. Why do they make so much silk in France? 
12. I cannot understand why nearly everybody drinks 
wine in France, when in our country we do not believe in it. 
147 eee
-P-A-G-E-154
  148 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
13. Why do we get our fashions from France? 
14. Why are France and Germany not very good neigh- 
bors? 
15. Does France trade much with other countries? 
16. Does France get as much help from her foreign pos- 
sessions as Britain does? 
17. Why is France a world power? 
18. What are French persons like? 
Such interest centers will be suggested by the children 
during the informal introductory discussion. They may be 
jotted down in notebooks as they are mentioned, and thus 
form a tentative outline for work. The children will probably 
select some as favorites, to be given most attention. They 
will also show some individual preferences, affording the 
teacher an opportunity to appoint chairmen of committees 
to be responsible for reports on certain problems or interest 
centers. 
Reading the map. Whatever our interest centers may be, 
everybody will turn to the map first, as the facts which it 
gives are necessary for the solution of any problem. 
The map of France tells so many simple and significant 
truths that it lends itself well to a map-reading exercise. 
With some care in questioning on the part of the teacher, 
the children may discover for themselves most of the follow- 
ing items, or similar ones. Every child should be able to 
read the map fairly well before he takes up the other reading 
matter in the books. (Atwood: New Geography, pages 161, 
182, 216-217. Frye: New Geography, pages 193-194, 207. 
Smith: Human Geography, Book I, pages 248-250; Book II, 
page 204. McMurry and Parkins: Elementary Geography, 
page 204; Advanced Geography, page 281.) 
What the maps tell us about the kind of place France is: 
1. It has a great deal of seacoast. 
2. There are two peninsulas which point off to the 
northwest. 
3. It has mountains for part of its border. 
4. It is very close to England in one place. 
5. It has a big highland in about the middle of the country.
-P-A-G-E-155
  UNIT 12. FRANCE 149 
6. It has four big rivers which flow off from the central 
highland. I want to find out whether they use these rivers 
much for boats. 
7. It has a straighter coast than Britain. I wonder if it 
has as many seaports. 
8. So much of the country is a plain that we can expect it 
to have much good farm land. 
9. It probably will be warmer here than in England, 
because it is so much farther south. They will be able to 
grow some crops here which cannot be raised in England. 
Perhaps they can market some of these crops there. 
10. There will probably be heavier rainfall on the penin- 
sulas, because the westerly winds will come to them from 
the sea. 
11. Between the central plateau and the upland of 
Brittany is a narrow strip, of lowland. This connects the 
Paris Basin and the plain west of the central plateau. It 
reminds me of the Mohawk Valley in New York, connecting 
the Central Plains of the United States with the Hudson 
Valley. 
12. Paris is in about the center of the big plain called 
the Paris Basin. 
13. I am surprised to find how far north France is. 
About all of it is north of Nebraska. 
14. The lines of ocean traffic seem to center at three 
ports. 
15. France would be an easy country to travel through 
because there are no high mountains on the inside. Perhaps 
this would help the people to understand each other better, 
because they could get together often. (The teacher should 
explain here how the arrangement of physical features in 
France tends toward centralization and unity. Perhaps no 
other nation has a physical setting more ideal in this 
respect.) 
16. There are many railroads which go through Paris. 
17. They have so many kinds of farm crops here: the 
tobacco makes me think of Kentucky; the olives, of Cali- 
fornia; the sugar beets, of Colorado; the wheat, of Minne-
-P-A-G-E-156
150 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
sota; etc. There must be a good many kinds of climates 
here, if all these things can be raised. 
18. Most of the boundary is either seacoast or mountains, 
but that next to Belgium is just lowland. 
19. France is well located for trade with Africa. 
20. It looks as if France had taken about one third of 
the whole continent of Africa. (Political map of Africa.) 
Each chairman should note the map facts which he thinks 
belong to his interest center, and use them later in reports. 
A Library Committee has been at work, collecting books 
and magazines which contain material on France. The books 
are listed on the blackboard, with pages given where wanted 
facts may be found. These books include any geography 
textbooks, supplementary books, etc. 
Gathering data and grouping results around selected 
interest centers. ‘Two interest centers which seem to be 
adapted to children of these grades, and which call for an 
investigation of the more essential characteristics of French 
life, are: Why are there so many farmers in France? Why do 
so many pretty things come from France? These have, there- 
fore, been chosen for outlining in this study. The teacher 
should feel entirely free to use any other problems which 
appeal more to her children. One or two problems of this 
kind, however, should be worked out by the entire class in 
committee of the whole. The other interest centers may 
then be assigned to smaller groups. 
Why are there so many farmers in France? 
What map facts will help to answer this problem? Esti- 
mate the per cent of land suitable for farming. (Nearly 
three fourths of France is under cultivation.) Facts to be 
gained from the textbook, the encyclopedias, the Statesman’s 
Year-Book (1921), The Literary Digest, February 11, 1922, and 
other references. What per cent of the population works on 
the farm? (40 per cent.) Do the farmers usually own their 
farms? How large are the farms? What does this sug- 
gest as to skill in farming? Does the farmer always live on 
the farm? What kind of a house does he live in? Is the 
farm well equipped as to buildings, implements, etc.? What 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
UNIT 12. FRANCE 151 
are the leading crops? the yield per acre of wheat, oats, pota- 
toes, rye? Compare with yield in our country. What does 
this difference suggest? The American farmer who feeds stock 
and so markets his crops indirectly, is the most prosperous. 
Does the French type of farming support much live stock? 
(McMurry and Parkins: Advanced Geography, page 297.) 
Make graphs showing proportionate area, population, 
and amount of live stock of France and of Nebraska, or 
any other agricultural state.

What conclusion do you draw from this comparison ? 
1. The wheat lands. (Seemaps. Atwood: New Geography, 
page 182; Appendix, page iv. Smith: Human Geography, 
Book II, page 206. Frye: New Geography, page 196.) 
Where are they? Nature of surface and soil. Compare with 
our own wheat belt. See rainfall map, to find the rainfall of 
the wheat lands. (Note that rains are quite frequent in 
this part of France.) 
See isotherm map, and note the July isotherm of 70 degrees 
and the January isotherm of 50 degrees. Are you surprised 
to find such mild winters as far north as France? The 
January temperature at Brest is 44 degrees. What is it at 
your home town? Trace these temperature lines from France 
westward across the United States. Where is the 70 degrees 
line with regard to our own wheat belt? Compare the two 
wheat belts in several respects. (See rainfall map of North  
-P-A-G-E-158
152 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
America.) Sketch the outline of France, trace the isotherm of 
70 degrees, then dot the wheat areas. Do the French export 
wheat? Why do they place a duty on flour? Do the French 
prefer wheat bread to bread made from rye or cornmeal? 
Do French menus usually require wheat? (See Figure 365, 
Atwood: New Geography.) What machinery is used in the 
French wheat fields? What methods of wheat growing differ 
from ours? (See encyclopedia.) Summarize all the reasons 
why much wheat is grown in France, and why their pro- 
duction per acre is greater than ours. 
2. The sugar-beet lands. What part of France is suited to 
sugar beets? Where are these areas? Nature of surface, 
soil, rainfall, summer temperatures? Sketch outline of 
France and indicate beet fields. In normal times, France 
produces 35 pounds of sugar per person. Is that enough? 
Is much hand labor required for sugar beets? 
3. The fruit and grape lands. What part of France is 
suited to oranges and lemons? Why? (For discussion of the 
Mediterranean climate, see Salisbury, Barrows, and Tower: 
Elements of Geography, pages 185-188. Smith: Human 
Geography, Book I, pages 96-100.) Compare southern 
France with southern California in regard to mild winter 
temperatures, sunny summers, winter rainfall, long frostless 
seasons, etc. Where are the principal vineyard districts? 
Explain their location. Are wine grapes like our table 
grapes? Is there much hand labor required in vineyards? 
(McMurry and Parkins: Advanced Geography, pages 285, 
314.) 
Where are the apple-growing areas? What conditions are 
favorable to the growth of apples? 
4. Market gardening and dairying. Where carried on? 
Why profitable there? 
5. Marketing the farm produce. Is the surface of France 
favorable to the marketing of farm crops? Are rivers, canals, 
and railroads so located as to be convenient for farmers 
everywhere in France? (France has 32,000 miles of rail- 
way. What is the railway mileage of your home state?) 
Are there many markets or few? What agricultural 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  UNIT 12. FRANCE 153 
products are marketed abroad? France is almost self- 
supporting as regards food. Summarize all the reasons you 
can find for this. 
Why do so many pretty things come from France? 
1. List of articles showing taste and skill in manufacture 
which are made in France. 
2. What kind of people are the French? Dorothy Can- 
field Fisher says (Woman’s Home Companion, February, 
1922), “The roughest, most illiterate old French carpenter 
in the most remote country village will not put up a shelf 
badly, not even to please the most hurried and impatient of 
American employers. . . . Practically every working per- 
son in France, whatever his trade, has the artist quality of 
pride and interest in his work. ... The French have a 
personal, never-failing interest in having things done right. 
Why can’t we try to catch from the French something of 
their splendid reverence for good workmanship, something 
of their critical spirit? ” 
Find other statements regarding the taste and skill of the 
French people. 
8. Shortage of coal prevents extensive manufacture of 
heavy iron and steel goods, ete. Locate the coal fields of 
France in a simple sketch map. Compare the coal output 
of France, Britain, Germany, the United States. What is 
the share per person in each country? Compare these 
countries in respect to their four leading manufactures. 
What opportunities for water power are found in France? 
4. Availability of certain raw materials: clay, silk, wool, 
hides and skins, flax, flowers (for perfume), cotton (from the 
United States), etc. Show how the Mediterranean climate 
favors the production of (a) silk, (b) goats, (c) flowers, etc. 
What raw materials come from the dependencies of France? 
Why? 
5. Find reasons for the location of cotton and woolen 
mills in northern France; silk, near Lyons; perfume, near 
Marseilles; china, near Limoges, ete. Locate the leading 
manufacturing cities on the coal map. 
6. The four leading exports of France are silk cloth, cotton 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  154 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
cloth, clothing, chemical products. Explain in each case 
why this is true. Who are the big buyers of French goods? 
Why? 
7. The six leading imports of France are cereals, coal, 
cast iron and steel, raw cotton, wood, and machinery. 
Explain. 
8. Summarize all the reasons you can find for the French 
type of manufacture. 
Some significant facts for drill. 
1. Area, over 200,000 square miles. (Use round numbers 
only in handling statistics.) 
Population, over 39 millions. 
Three other countries, or states, of about the same size. 
Three countries of about the same rank in population. 
Exact location of six or seven cities, selected by class. 
Location of the four most important rivers. 
Location of the following surface features: central 
inten: upland of Brittany, Paris Basin, the Alps, Pyrenees 
Mountains, Vosges Mountains, Jura Mountains. 
8. Wheat yield (round numbers) in millions of bushels. 
9. Sugar output in millions of pounds. 
10. Coal output in millions of tons. 
11. The three bodies of water bordering France. 
12. Approximate distance from New York City. 
13. Four of the most important colonial possessions. 
14. Approximate latitude of Paris. 
Some suggestions for children’s activities. 
1. Model the country in sand. Locate the central high- 
lands, the mountain borders, the four great rivers, eight or 
ten cities. 
2. Have different groups of children dramatize selected 
events in French life. They should choose the event they 
wish to present and plan the simple costumes and the action 
needed. The following is a list which may be helpful: 
(a) A scene in a French vineyard. 
(6). A scene in an olive grove. 
(c) In the sugar-beet fields. 
(@ In the wheat fields. Sr

UNIT 13. THE NORTHERN PLAINS— 
GERMANY 
Time required: 2 weeks 
Finding the starting point. Who has ancestors who lived in 
Germany? Songs, poems, stories of Germany that we like. 
What Germany has furnished to us: toys, jewelry, linen, 
chemicals, dyes, glass and porcelain, optical goods, electri- 
cal goods, leather goods, cloth, machinery, fertilizer, etc. 
Famous Germans we have heard about: Froebel (Kinder- 
garten), Luther, Beethoven, Wagner, Roentgen (X-ray), 
Krupp, Koch, Humboldt, Schiller, Goethe, ete. Travelers’ 
accounts of a visit to the Passion Play, a trip up the Rhine, 
life in the Black Forest, the Krupp works, Dresden art 
galleries, beautiful streets in Berlin, German opera, experi- 
ences in a German university, etc. 
Reading the map. Germany stretches across the plain 
from west to east. It is in two parts. East Prussia 
is not connected with the larger part. A little more than 
half of Germany is in the central highlands of Europe, and 
it is made up of plateaus and mountains. I cannot see that its 
boundaries on the plain are natural. Its irregular southern 
boundary is largely made up of mountains. The Rhine forms 
part of the eastern boundary. I think this country would be 
hard to defend on the east and west. It has a very short coast 
line on the North Sea, and two large rivers, the Weser and 
the Elbe, flow into it; they locate the two ports, Hamburg 
and Bremen. The Baltic seacoast is very irregular; since 
the map tells me that the Baltic waters are shallow, and the 
German lands touching it are low, I do not expect to find 
very good harbors here. The Oder River flows into the 
Baltic, and I find the port of Stettin near its mouth. Berlin 
is almost at the center of the German plain. The railroads 
branch out from Berlin like the spokes of a wheel. I think 
the rivers on the plain would be navigable. The Rhine 
River interests me; it starts in Switzerland, and ends in the 
Netherlands. A part of the upper Rhine has a wider valley 
157 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  158 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
than the middle Rhine; there are many ‘cities on the lower 
Rhine. I believe Germany is quite well located for trade 
with the rest of Europe. Its North Sea ports are convenient 
for Atlantic trade. The Kiel Canal gives a waterway 
from the Baltic to the North Sea. Since there is a wide 
range of latitude here, and a variety of surface, I shall expect 
to find that many kinds of crops can be grown. The popu- 
lation map shows me that there is a very dense population 
in the western part of the German plain and along the Rhine 
Valley. The rainfall map shows that nearly all of Germany 
gets sufficient rain, and that it is largely a summer rain. 
From the coal map of Europe, I see that Germany has many 
coal fields, some of which are near the Rhine; perhaps they 
use the river to transport this coal. The glaciation map 
shows that about all the German plain was covered with 
glacial ice, so we know there will be glacial soils here. There 
are many cities on the German plain. There are more states 
in the uplands than on the plain. 
Discovering some interest centers. I should like to read 
about the toymakers in Germany. The busy port of Ham- 
burg interests me; they say you can get a boat there for 
almost any place in the world. I will find out about the 
Hamburg-American Line. Does Germany manufacture as 
much as England? Did Germany lose much in the war? 
Why have so many Germans come to our country? Does 
Germany raise much food? Is Germany, like Britain, 
overcrowded? How do people make a living here? What 
does it mean to a country to occupy the middle of the great 
European plain? Why was Germany a world power? I 
should like to make a comparison between Germany and 
France, and score the two countries on points. 
Working out some of the problems. How do the people 
make a living? Let us start with the statement that half 
the people depend on manufacturing and mining. Another 
figure fact that helps us to understand German life is that 
over half the people live in cities. What are some reasons 
for this? 
What is the area? population? density of population per 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  UNIT 13. THE NORTHERN PLAINS— GERMANY 159 
square mile? Do you think wages would then be high? 
Are the people energetic? Consult temperature maps to 
find the kind of summers and winters they have here. Com- 
pare with Spain. Davis, in his book, The Roots of the War, 
says, “ No other country has so many people who live under 
a highly energizing climate and are also under a single gov- 
ernment.”” What are some of the characteristics of German 
workmen? Do they have a chance for technical training 
in their schools? In what lines are they superior? 
If manufacturing is highly developed, we may expect to 
find an abundance of coal or water power. Notice from the 
coal map the location of the coal fields. Why favorable? 
From encyclopedias and other books, find out the kind of 
coal produced here; the yearly output (over 300 million 
tons in 1914); the uses of coke in Germany; how coke is 
made; how Germans make profit from the by-products of 
coke making; etc. Make a simple sketch map of Germany. 
Locate four coal fields and four rivers. 
We have found that Germany has an abundance of labor, 
skilled and energetic, and that she has coal, well located 
for transportation, which she uses economically. What raw 
materials has she for manufacture? Since her leading export 
is iron and steel goods, we shall discuss that first. Where are 
her iron-ore areas? How serious was the loss of the Lorraine 
fields? Compared with our Lake Superior iron ore, the 
German ore is low grade. How do they overcome this 
handicap? Does Germany import any iron ore? List all 
the iron and steel manufactures you can find mentioned for 
Germany. Why is Germany able to make the steel wares 
requiring much material, as, for instance, structural steel, 
rails, steel plates for ships, machinery, etc.? Why is there 
also so varied an output of smaller articles calling for less 
material but much labor? What are the leading cities that 
manufacture steel goods? Locate four of these on your 
sketch map. 
We find that cloth making ranks next to the manufacture 
of iron and steel goods. What raw materials are found here? 
In 1914, Germany produced 10 million tons of flax. Where 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  160 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
are the flax areas? What climatic conditions are necessary? 
Where else in the world is flax grown extensively? Find out 
why Russia leads the world in flax growing. Does Germany 
import from Russia? Is linen cloth as much in demand as 
cotton? Germany must import all her cotton; why, then, 
does she manufacture so much? Where does she get her 
cotton? To whom does she sell the cloth? Is much wool 
produced here? (In 1914, Germany imported more than ten 
times as much wool as she produced at home.) Compare 
the number of sheep in Germany (2 millions) with the 
number in Britain. What reasons can you find for this small 
number of sheep? Name four textile-making cities, and 
locate them on your sketch map. Tell why they are well 
located. 
Why is leather manufacture profitable here? What 
countries furnish hides and skins? Copper is much in de- 
mand; who furnishes most of it? What articles are made 
here? How does Germany rank in the manufacture of 
electrical goods? 
The manufacture of sugar is important. Where are the 
sugar-beet areas? What conditions of soil, rainfall, and 
temperature are favorable? Germany grows about one half 
the world’s sugar beets. Where, in our country, are sugar 
beets grown? Does Germany export sugar? 
Name other manufactures of Germany, and try to find 
out why they are profitable here. List the minerals found 
in this country, and show how they furnish a foundation for 
certain manufactures. 
To what countries does Germany sell her goods? In 
normal times Germany manufactures so extensively that 
only 30 per cent of her products is needed at home; she 
must find markets outside for the remaining 70 per cent. 
From your books of reference, list the five countries that are 
the largest buyers of German goods. In each case try to 
think why so much is imported from Germany. Find out 
how German goods are transported. Why are there so 
many German ships on all seas? Find out what you can 
about the Hamburg-American Steamship Company; the
-P-A-G-E-167
  UNIT 18. THE NORTHERN PLAINS— GERMANY 161 
North German Lloyd. What special advantages has Ham- 
burg asa port? How does Germany use her waterways? (She 
has nearly 8000 miles of waterways. How does this com- 
pare with France?) Germany has over 35,000 miles of 
railway. Compare with the railway mileage in your own 
state. China has only 7000 miles. Is China a great com- 
mercial country? On the whole, how does Germany com- 
pare with other great industrial nations in her transportation 
facilities? On your sketch map draw in. red some of the 
main railroad lines which center in Berlin; which connect 
with the Rhine Valley; which extend into Czecho-Slovakia, 
into Poland, into the Ukraine. 
Some of the people make a living by farming. Why is 
the number of farmers so small? How does it compare with 
that of France? of Britain? We should expect the plains to 
be good farming land. Find statements in your textbooks 
as to the soils. The glacial soils of Iowa and Illinois are deep 
and fertile. Why are glacial soils not so good in Germany? 
Where on the plains are the best soil areas? Farms in the 
western part are small; on the eastern plain there are many 
very large estates. The average German farm, however, is 
only thirteen acres. Can you find some reasons for this? 
Do most farmers own their land? How does all the family 
help with farm work in Germany? Rye is the leading grain. 
Why? Germany grows about one fourth of the world’s rye. 
How does she use it? Does she export any? Why does she 
not grow wheat on her rye areas? Potatoes are a very im- 
portant crop; Germany grows almost half the world’s 
supply. What soil, rainfall, and temperature conditions 
favor this? Do potatoes call for much hand labor? What 
other use besides human food is made of these potatoes? 
We found Germany a great sugar producer. Does this call 
for many laborers? In wheat, Germany does not rank so 
high. She has to import about one third of what she uses. 
From what neighboring countries can she get it? She im- 
ports almost as much barley as she raises. What is it used 
for? 
Would you expect a crowded land like Germany to have 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  162 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
much live stock? Hogs lead in the list. Why would Ger- 
many have so many, when Britain has so few? Cattle are 
next in rank, but there is a very high per cent of dairy cattle. 
Under what conditions is dairying profitable? Germany 
imports much fish, meat, and eggs. From what countries? 
Germany makes good use of her land. She plows about 
half of it: over 90 per cent of the whole area produces some- 
thing. Does she have materials for fertilizers? Where are 
the great potash areas? What South American country 
sends nitrates for fertilizer? Perhaps you will read some- 
where how nitrogen-fixing plants extract nitrate from the air. 
Many persons in Germany make a living by caring for the 
forests. Find out some ways in which Germany surpasses 
the United States in forestry. 
As a summary, tell in your own words some ways of 
making a living in Germany. Do young people have as 
many opportunities here as in America? If you lived in 
Germany, what business would you like to be in?

  UNIT 14. THE MEDITERRANEAN LANDS—ITALY 
Time required: 2 weeks 
Finding the starting point. Italians we know in this 
country. What is their work? Famous Italians we admire: 
Garibaldi, Caruso, Marconi. Accounts of travel in Italy by 
persons we know. Articles in our homes that came from 
Italy: jewelry, corals, Venetian glass, prints and casts, 
macaroni, lemons from Sicily, olives and olive oil, straw hats 
(Leghorn or Milan), pictures of beautiful scenes in Italy, 
etc. Vesuvius and its eruptions. Stories of ancient Rome. 
Roman heroes: Julius Cesar, Horatius, etc. Italian ex- 
plorers: Columbus, Americus Vespucius, Marco Polo, and 
others. Interesting places we have heard about in Italy: the 
Bay of Naples, Capri, Mt. Vesuvius, Mt. Etna, the Italian 
Lakes, Florence, the Arno, the hill towns, Genoa (the birth- 
place of Columbus); Rome, with St. Peter’s and the Vatican, 
the catacombs, the ruins of the Forum, and the Colosseum, 
the Roman Aqueducts, the Appian Way, the Campagna; 
Venice, with its palaces, St. Mark’s, the Rialto, the Lido, 
canals, gondolas, Bridge of Sighs, Horses of St. Mark’s, etc. 
What would you most like to see in Italy? Have you read 
about the St. Gotthard and Simplon tunnels? How do 
they compare with the Hoosac Tunnel in Massachusetts? 
Reading the map. Italy looks like a boot. Its top out- 
line is very irregular. Does it follow the crests of the moun- 
tains? It looks as if all its boundaries were natural. I 
wonder if the Alps make as good a fence as the Pyrenees. 
The coast line is quite straight; there are more cities on the 
west coast than on the east. The part of Italy that lies on 
the east of the Adriatic is very rough, and the coast line is 
much broken. Italy is largely mountainous. There is a 
wedge-shaped plain (Lombardy plain) in the north, and a 
narrow coastal plain in some places along the edges. The 
Apennines run all along the leg of the boot and down into 
the toe; I notice that they curve to the east. This makes 
the western slope the longest, and the Tiber and the Arno 
have a longer course than the eastern rivers. Is that one 
164

UNIT 14. MEDITERRANEAN LANDS—ITALY 165 
reason why Florence and Rome are on the west side of 
Italy? I should expect the Lombardy plain to get much 
sediment from the highlands that surround it. It has the 
largest river of Italy, the Po. There are more cities in this 
plain than in any other part of Italy. In the population map 
of Europe I can locate the Lombardy plain because of its 
dense population. I suppose it has good farming land; 
railroading would be easy there. From the rainfall map of 
Europe I can see that the Lombardy plain has more rain 
than the southern part of Italy. I begin to wonder if this 
Lombardy plain is not something like the lowland belt of 
Scotland, or the Paris Basin, or the central valley of Chile. 
I am interested in the two islands, Sardinia and Sicily; the 
population map shows Sicily is densely peopled and Sardinia 
is not: I wonder why. Italy is well situated for trade with 
Africa; I wonder if she has any colonies in Africa; the map 
shows three, and one of them, Libya, is just across the 
Mediterranean from Italy. I think Italy is not very well 
situated for Atlantic trade. I wonder if the Alps make rail- 
roading difficult into France, or into Germany. Are there 
many passes through the Alps? I see that Rome is in about 
the same latitude as Chicago: why is the climate so different? 
I notice that the other Mediterranean peninsulas have more 
than one country on them: I wonder why Italy got a 
peninsula all to herself. 
Discovering some interest centers. I should like to 
know why persons live on the sides of Vesuvius, when they 
know it is so dangerous. Why do so many Italians come to 
our country and to South America? Rome used to be the 
world’s leading city; why isn’t she now? I should like to 
find out all I can about Rome. I should like to find out why 
Venice has canals for streets. Why is Italy an art center? 
Italy is a world power. Why? I should like to compare 
Italy and Spain, because they are both Mediterranean coun- 
tries and are on peninsulas. Why is the one so much more 
important than the other? I should like to know how so 
small a country as Italy can take care of so many people. 
Is the country overcrowded?  
-P-A-G-E-172
  166 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
Working out one of the problems. Compare Italy and 
Spain, to find out why Italy is the more important. 
1. Note every point you can think of as to the location 
of the two countries. Which has the best position for over- 
land trade with Europe? for Mediterranean trade? for 
Atlantic trade? Compare the countries in area, population, 
density of population. Find reasons why Spain is so thinly 
populated. Compare the proportion of lowland in each 
country; the Ebro and Guadalquivir valleys in Spain with 
the Lombardy plain of Italy; the coastal plains of the two 
countries. Compare the central highlands of Spain with the 
Apennines. What are some serious difficulties in regard to 
communication in Spain? Compare the Pyrenees and 
Cantabrians with the Alps. Which has more roads and 
railroads? Compare the coast lines and the seaports; select 
four seaports of each country and pair them off; which have 
the advantage? Then compare the inland cities of the two 
countries. 
2. Compare the areas as to rainfall, summer and winter 
temperatures. Which has the largest arid region? From 
Statesman’s Year-Book 'and encyclopedias, find figure facts 
as to yield of wheat, rye, barley, corn, rice, grapes, fruit, 
olives, ete. Which has more land under irrigation? What 
farming methods are used? What live stock is kept in each 
country? Why are there so many goats and donkeys, so 
many cattle and sheep, in Spain? 
8. What is the coal output in each country? Which im- 
ports the more coal? Why? What other minerals are found? 
Why does not Spain profit more from her iron and copper 
ore? What is manufactured in the two countries? Why is 
Italy, with little coal and limited raw materials, so far ahead 
of Spain in manufactures? Which country has developed 
more water power? How does Italy use the steam vents of 
her volcanic area to develop power? 
4. Which has more miles of railroad? better roads? 
Which people are more united? Why is Spain like a group 
of separate states instead of a strongly united people? In 
each country what is the attitude of the people toward work? 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
UNIT 14. MEDITERRANEAN LANDS—ITALY 167 
Can you explain this? Compare the two peoples in per cent 
of illiteracy. Compare the customs of the people as to games 
and sports, dress and food, homes and family life. In which 
country does the government do more for the people? 
5. Compare the countries as to number and value of their 
foreign possessions. Why did Spain lose so many valuable 
colonies? Compare the countries as to their foreign trade. 
Which exports the more? Which country is more attractive 
to tourists? 
6. In general, what are the disadvantages in this winter- 
rainfall type of climate? What are the advantages? Can 
you see why Mediterranean lands developed a high civiliza- 
tion very early? Explain why California, with its Medi- 
terranean climate, is prosperous, while Italy and Spain are 
lands of poverty. Italy encourages some of her people to 
emigrate to lands of better opportunity. In what two ways 
will that benefit her? Do many Spaniards emigrate? In 
which of the two countries would you rather live? Why? 
Summarize the points in which Italy is superior to Spain.

  UNIT 15. THE BALKAN LANDS—JUGO-SLAVIA 
Time required: 1 week 
Finding the starting point. 
1. What we know about Slavs in general. 
2. Serbia’s experiences in the World War. 
3. The American Red Cross in Serbian Relief. 
Reading the map. With some care in questioning on the 
part of the teacher, the children may discover for themselves 
most of the following map facts or others equally significant: 
1. Jugo-Slavia has a very irregular boundary line. 
2. Part of the boundary is along the Drave and the 
Danube rivers. 
8. Almost all the rivers of the country flow toward the 
Danube. Only a few very short streams empty into the 
Adriatic. 
4, There is no coastal lowland. 
5. Belgrade is located at the junction of the Save and the 
Danube rivers, and not far from the mouth of the Morava. 
That makes me think of St. Louis, near the junction of the 
Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and not far from the mouth 
of the Ohio. I wonder if Belgrade is as large as St. Louis. 
6. Belgrade is almost on the dividing line between the 
highlands and the lowlands. That makes me think of 
Denver. 
7. There are not many railroads in the mountainous part 
of Jugo-Slavia. 
8. One line of railway goes past Belgrade, up the valley 
of the Morava River, then down the valley of the Vardar 
River, to the Greek port of Saloniki. (One of the most sig- 
nificant facts in Jugo-Slavic geography.) 
9. Jugo-Slavia does not own all the Adriatic coast line on 
the eastern front of her area. Some of it belongs to Italy. 
It makes me think of the long Alaskan coast belonging to 
the United States, which is on the western front of Canada’s 
territory. 
10. There are many islands along the coast of Jugo-Slavia. 
168 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
UNIT 15. BALKAN LANDS—JUGO-SLAVIA 169 
This is like the Norwegian coast. I wonder if the Jugo-Slavs 
are as skillful seamen as the Norwegians. 
11. There is such a great variety of products in this area 
that it makes me think of France. I should not expect to 
find wheat and corn and tobacco and olives grown in areas 
so close together. There must be several kinds of climates 
here. (Continental and Mediterranean climates should be 
discussed and explained.) 
12. Jugo-Slavia has many neighbors — Italy, Austria, 
Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania. I wonder if 
she gets along well with them all. 
Choosing an interest center. A statement in the child’s 
own words of something he would like to do or to know about 
a given area may become an interest center. The following 
are typical: 
1. I should like to know why Serbia had such a hard time 
during the World War. 
2. Jugo-Slavia and Italy are about the same size. I should 
like to compare the two countries to see if Jugo-Slavia could 
ever be a world power, like Italy. 
3. I should like to compare Jugo-Slavia and Czecho- 
Slovakia because they are both Slavic countries, and because 
they are both new as independent nations. 
Gathering data and grouping results around the interest 
center. We might select for our interest center the fol- 
lowing: What chance has Jugo-Slavia to become a world 
power ? : 
1. What kind of people are the Jugo-Slavs? Are they ca- 
pable of working together for the good of their common 
country? Do they all speak the same language? Do they 
have the same religion? Do they have good schools? Are 
most of the people able to read and write? Do many of the 
peasants own their farms? (See Statesman’s Year-Book, 
1921, page 1268.) Why is this a good thing for the country? 
Compare with France. Are the people brave soldiers? Are 
they loyal to their king? Do they have a good king? Are 
there people enough in Jugo-Slavia to make it a world power? 
Compare with Italy.
-P-A-G-E-176
170 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
2. Is their country well located for trade with other coun- 
tries? Trace their routes of travel (a) from Belgrade to 
Constantinople, (6) from Belgrade to Saloniki, (c) from 
Belgrade to the Black Sea, (d) from Belgrade to Hamburg, 
(e) from Belgrade to Fiume and Trieste. 
Explain what trade these routes would give them; what 
products would probably be sent over these lines. 
3. Is this country large enough and productive enough 
to make of the Jugo-Slavs a great nation? Compare in area 
with Italy and Czecho-Slovakia. 
Imagine a great wall around Jugo-Slavia, so that ‘no 
products could be sent out of or brought into the country. 
Then let us see if the people could manage to live comfortably 
on their own products. Do they raise enough breadstuffs? 
What cereals are grown here? Have they meat animals 
enough to furnish meat for all? What would they do for 
sugar? What fruits would they have? How about materials 
for clothing — wool, flax, cotton, silk? Judging by the live 
stock they raise, would there be hides and skins enough for 
shoes and other articles made of leather? Why are so many 
goats raised here? 
Notice the rainfall and the isotherm maps, and draw con- 
clusions regarding the climate here. Recall the conditions 
favorable for (a) corn, (b) wheat, (c) tobacco, (d) olives, 
(e) grapes. Where in the United States are each of these 
grown in abundance? A corn belt requires summer rain. 
Olives grow best where the rain comes in winter. Account 
for this difference in rainfall in a small area. 
What minerals are found in Jugo-Slavia? Notice where 
the coal beds are located. Is this favorable? Recall the coal 
fields of Germany located near the Rhine, and their impor- 
tance. Could the Jugo-Slavs manufacture farm machinery? 
equipment for railroads? boats? cloth? articles made from 
lumber? Why is carpet weaving important? What are 
the leading exports and imports? (See Statesman’s Year- 
Book, 1921, page 1269.) 
Mark off a score board as if for a game. Then list all the 
points favorable and unfavorable to Jugo-Slavia on opposite 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
UNIT 15. BALKAN LANDS—JUGO-SLAVIA 171 
sides of the line, and thus draw conclusions as to the possi- 
bilities of this interesting country. 
Some significant facts for drill. 
1. Location of the Danube, Drave, Save, Morava, and 
Vardar rivers, with relation to Jugo-Slavia. 
2. Location of the following cities: Belgrade, Monastir, 
Cattaro, Spalato, Cetinje. 
3. Some figure facts: area, population, annual output of 
leading agricultural products. 
4. Three important railroad routes. 
Suggestions for children’s activities. Make graphs show- 
ing a comparison of Italy with Jugo-Slavia according to the 
statistics given in the following table:

  UNIT 16. CZECHO-SLOVAKIA AND CENTRAL 
EUROPE 
Time required: 2 weeks 
Finding the starting point. 
1. Bohemians (or Czechs) whom we know in this country. 
2. Czecho-Slovakia is a newly created republic which is 
now undergoing a testing time. For 1500 years these people 
have struggled to maintain their national existence. Political 
independence has just been granted to them. They are 
repeating, in some measure, the history of our own republic. 
They have our sympathy and our admiration. 
8. Great men of Bohemia: Comenius, who gave to the 
world the idea of pictures in school books; John Huss, a 
great religious reformer; Thomas Mazaryk, the present 
great president, a philosopher and scholar, a peasant boy 
who became famous. 
4. Bohemian music and art. 
Reading the map. The following are typical of map facts 
which the children may be led to discover for themselves: 
1. Czecho-Slovakia is almost in the middle of the conti- 
nent of Europe. 
2. It hasn’t any seacoast. 
8. It isn’t very large. It is only 50,000 square miles in 
area. It is nearly three times as large as Switzerland, an 
independent country. 
4. It has many mountains. So many of them are on the 
border that they make a kind of a fence for the country. 
5. Czecho-Slovakia has several neighbors — Germany, 
Poland, Rumania, Hungary, Austria. 
6. It is about 500 miles from the center of this country 
to the seacoast (North Sea, Baltic, or Adriatic). I wonder if 
that will not be a hindrance to trade with distant nations. 
7. A big river, the Elbe, rises in Czecho-Slovakia and goes 
through Germany. Maybe the Czechs can use it to ship 
their products to the sea. 
8. The Oder River rises in this country too, and goes 
173
-P-A-G-E-180
  174 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
north through Germany. It looks as if the Czechs could 
trade with Germany easily. 
9. And here is the Danube that touches its border at one 
place (Pressburg). They could use the Danube, and that 
would take them’ to the Black Sea. 
10. There are not so many towns mapped in Slovakia 
as in the Czech lands. Are there not so many people there? 
11. They grow sugar beets, barley, rye, oats, and flax 
in this country. I wonder why they don’t grow wheat and 
corn. 
12. They have coal, iron, copper, and clay in this little 
country. Probably they are a great manufacturing people. 
13. The country is so rough in places that I wonder if 
there is not much waste land here. 
Choosing some interest centers. An interest center is 
some definite thing one wishes to know about an area; 
something about which one has a lively curiosity. It may 
be a problem, although no single problem can center all 
the interests of an area so complex as this. It originates 
with the child and is expressed in his own words. It may be 
a question, a statement of a desire to find out something 
which is puzzling him, or it may be his wish to draw a com- 
parison. It is what the child would like to do and to know. 
The following are typical of the child’s interest centers as 
he states them himself: 
1. Why did so many Bohemians leave their own country 
and come to the Middle West in the United States? 
2. I should like to find out how this little country got its 
independence. 
* 8. Czecho-Slovakia reminds me of Switzerland, because 
it is a mountainous little country, without any seacoast. I 
should like to make a comparison of the two. 
4. I am interested in this country, because it reminds me 
of our own country, in its struggle for political independence. 
I should like to find out if it has much chance to succeed as 
an independent country. 
Gathering data and grouping results around an interest 
center. The interest center which seems to call for an 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  
UNIT 16. CZECHO-SLOVAKIA 175 
investigation of the more essential characteristics of Czecho- 
Slovakia, and which seems well adapted to children of these 
grades, is often expressed as follows: I should like to find out 
af Czecho-Slovakia has much chance to succeed as an independent 
country. The teacher should feel entirely free to use any 
other interest center which appeals more to the children. 
A problem of this type, however, should be worked out by 
the entire class. Other interest centers may then be assigned 
to smaller groups. 
T should like to find out if Czecho-Slovakia has much chance 
to succeed as an independent country. 
1. Let us summarize the favorable and unfavorable points 
we have gained from the map. This will help us decide 
whether or not we think Czecho-Slovakia can succeed as an 
independent country. 
2. What further facts do we need to know in order to be 
able to estimate the possibilities of the area? 
(a) Whether it has much good soil or not. What they 
raise there. Whether it has a favorable climate for food 
crops. (Rainfall and isotherm maps.) How much coal, iron, 
copper, and lumber it produces. (See encyclopedias and 
Statesman’s Year-Book for figure facts on these products.) 
(6) What kind of people are here? Can they all read and 
write? Are there different races in the country, which may 
make trouble for each other? Do they have good schools? 
Do they have good leaders? Have they a good constitution? 
Are they willing to learn from other people who have had 
more experience in managing a republic? 
(c) Is there work enough in the country to keep the people 
busy and give them a chance to earn a living? Who owns 
the land, the common people or an aristocratic class? Are 
the farms small, or are there many large estates? (Which 
condition is better for a country? What condition is true 
in regard to France?) What is manufactured here? Why? 
Where are the markets for Czecho-Slovakian wares? Make a 
list of the occupations of Bohemians you know inthis country. 
Compare this with a second list you make for Mexicans 
in this country. Which indicates the better training?
-P-A-G-E-182
    176 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
(d) Can the people of Czecho-Slovakia be sure of a passage 
through the countries which are between them and the sea? 
Are there good roads in this country? How many miles of 
railway do they have? (Compare with railway mileage 
of your home state.) Notice on the map the network of 
railroads in Czecho-Slovakia. Find the places where they 
cross the mountains. What is probably true about the 
mountains at these places? At how many points do the 
railroads cross the mountains (a) in Bohemia, (6) in 
Slovakia? 
(e) Are the neighbors of Czecho-Slovakia friendly? This 
country has recently made friendly treaties with Rumania, 
Jugo-Slavia, Austria, and Poland. Why with these particular 
countries? Which of these countries are largely Slavic in 
population? What products have the Czechs which their 
neighbors need? (Notice that Austria is coal poor.) What 
products of their neighbors do the Czechs need? What does 
Czecho-Slovakia import from America? What has she to 
send us in return? 
(f) List the field crops named in the product map or in 
the reading matter of your textbook, and find out, for each, 
the climate, soil, and labor requirements. Are cattle, sheep, 
and hogs abundant? (Statesman’s Year-Book.) Can you 
see one reason for this? Is enough food grown here for all 
the people? 
(g) Notice the coal and lignite fields. Are they well 
located? Find out how the coal output in Czecho-Slovakia 
compares with that of France; of Belgium. Why is clay 
listed on the map? 
Summarize the favorable and unfavorable points gained 
from the entire investigation, and reach a conclusion re- 
garding this — the most hopeful of all the new countries of 
Europe. 
Suggestions for children’s activities. 
1. Selected children plan talks on Czecho-Slovakia to be 
given before some other grade. 
2. Certain children personify Czecho-Slovakia and her 
neighbors. Each presents her case, asks for fair treatment,
-P-A-G-E-183
  UNIT 16. CZECHO-SLOVAKIA a 
and promises aid to the others. A representative of the 
United States appears, states our relation to the Czechs, 
and gives advice and friendly offers. 
8. Model the country in sand. Locate the more important 
physical features, four or five cities, two or three railway 
lines, and two or three coal areas. 
4. Make graphs comparing France and Czecho-Slovakia. 
France is so nearly self-supporting that it is always a good 
country with which to compare other areas.

make a list of the facts they judge most significant. After 
the list has been made in this democratic fashion, discuss 
ways of learning the facts, so that they will become easily 
obtained tools for further work. It becomes a matter of 
pride, of personal responsibility, that each child has these 
tools in readiness for use. 
In the list include locational facts, figure facts, climatic 
data, human-interest facts, personal facts. Have the children 
rank these, numbering them in order of importance. This 
will then become a relative importance test.

1. What is meant by a prairie? Our own prairie plains, 
with corn belt and wheat belt. 
2. American relief for Russian famine sufferers. 
8. Slavs we know in America. Where they came from, 
and what they do for a living. 
Reading the map. 
1. The Ukraine has a very irregular boundary. Part of it 
is along a swamp, part along a river, the Dniester, and a 
little bit of it is along the coast of the Black Sea. 
2. It is a good thing for the Ukraine that Odessa belongs 
to its territory. That gives it a good seaport. 
8. There are long rivers here. They remind me of the 
long rivers of our own prairie plains — the Mississippi and 
the Missouri. 
4. There is not a mountain or a plateau in the whole 
country. 
5. They grow wheat, barley, rye, and sugar beets. 
6. There are coal fields along the Dnieper and the Donetz 
rivers. I think that would be a very convenient location. 
There is some iron, too, near the Donetz field. That ought 
to encourage manufacturing. 
7. I think the farmers of the Ukraine could sell their 
grain to Germany or Britain, because neither of those 
countries raises enough for itself. 
8. I wonder if the Ukraine would not be a hard country to 
defend, because it has almost no natural fence around it, as 
has Czecho-Slovakia or France. 
9. Most of the cities seem to be on rivers — Kiev on the 
Dnieper, New Odessa on the Bug, etc. 
10. The railroads make a kind of a network over the area.

I believe they are distributed more evenly than they are in 
Jugo-Slavia. One line connects with Moscow, two or three 
lines with Warsaw, and another line connects the area near 
the Donetz with Baku, the oil-well city, on the Caspian Sea. 
I am surprised to find so few lines extending to Odessa. 
11. This whole country makes me think of our own wheat 
area in North Dakota. Both places are in about the same 
latitude. I believe the Ukraine has the advantage in that 
it can send wheat by water to foreign markets. 
Choosing some interest centers. 
1. Why have so many Little Russians, as the people of 
the Ukraine are called, come to America? 
2. Is this prairie land able to furnish as much food as our 
Central Plains? 
8. I should like to compare this prairie land with our own 
prairie plains and see which has the advantage. 
Gathering data and grouping results around the interest 
center. The following suggestions pertain to the working 
out of the problem: Compare the Ukraine and the Central 
Plains of the United States. 
1. Let us compare them first in size. The Ukraine is 
about 175,000 square miles. (Statesman’s Year-Book, 1923.) 
The Central Plains of the United States are about one fourth 
of the entire United States. How many square miles is that 
in round numbers? 
2. Now compare them in population. The Ukraine — 
about 26 million people. The Central Plains — about one 
third of the entire population of the United States. How 
many is that? 
8. Compare them in their location in the continent. 
What advantage does the Ukraine have in this respect? 
Is a position on the Black Sea better than a location in the 
middle of a continent, even if the Great Lakes are a help 
in transporting farm products? Which of these two prairies 
is the farther north? 
4. Compare the areas in rainfall and temperature. (See 
rainfall and isotherm maps.) 
5. Compare as to crops produced in the two prairies. 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  
UNIT 17. THE UKRAINE 181 
From maps, list farm crops of the American prairies. Then 
compare with crops found in the Ukraine. Can you see why 
cattle, sheep, and hogs are numerous on the American plain 
and are not so important in the Ukraine? 
6. Compare as to the location of iron and coal fields. 
What minerals found in one prairie are not found in the 
other? What manufacturing could develop in the Ukraine? 
Over half of the world’s farm machinery is made in our 
Central Plains. Could the Ukraine develop that industry ? 
Which of the two prairies is ahead in the making of sugar? 
Where are the oil fields which are nearest to the Ukraine? 
nearest to our prairie plains? 
7. Compare the two plains in the number of large 
cities. Let Odessa and Chicago balance each other. Then 
see if you can find Ukrainian cities to match Cleveland, 
Detroit, Kansas City, Omaha, St. Louis, etc. 
8. Compare the people of the two areas in education, in 
home life, in government, in training for citizenship, etc. 
(The Ukraine is now a Soviet state.) 
9. Make any other comparison you think is a fair one; 
then score each area as to points favorable. Which prairie 
is the winner?

1. What we already know about lands of the far north. 
2. What we know about the Finns as a people. 
8. History stories of the Finns and their struggle for 
freedom. 
4. Finnish music and literature. The Victor record 
“ Finlandia.” 
Americans in general know so little about Finland that it 
is difficult for them to realize what an interesting and 
important country it is. The following brief quotations from 
magazines, books of travel, etc., may help the child to 
appreciate the admirable and intelligent people who live 
in this northern land: 
Finland is preéminently the land of education and religion, the most 
progressive country in Europe in many respects, and a land that has sent 
hundreds of thousands of enterprising emigrants to America to develop our 
abundant resources. .. . In many directions Finland has led the world 
in moral and political reforms. She put prohibition into the constitution 
of the Republic six months before America did the same. She has had 
unrestricted woman suffrage for many years.... Education is free, 
universal, and compulsory, and her schools are superior to ours in some 
respects. — Francis E. Cuark. 
There is no more interesting people in Europe, and certainly not a more 
progressive and delightful one. . . . There is much about the Finn that 
is admirable. He is a believer in obedience to the law. He is honest and 
hospitable. Bravery, perseverance, and an intense love of liberty are attri- 
butes of the Finn which history tells. Only five in every hundred cannot 
read and write; in the neighboring Russia, about 70 per cent are illiterate. 
In the United States (judging by army statistics) about twenty in a hundred 
are illiterate. — Journal of Geography. 
If I wished a son of mine to learn languages, gymnastics, music, and 
patriotism thoroughly well, I should send him to a Finnish school. — 
Travers: Letters from Finland. 
Finland is a little country, but it is the focus of some brave ideas, and its 
short story has no soiled pages. A desolate and water-logged land, in a hard 
northern climate, three quarters of its surface destitute of population, 
possessing no natural wealth except its forests, and no natural advantages 
except its waterfalls; where the ripening crops race against the descending 
182

UNIT 18. FINLAND 183 
frosts for their harvest goal, and are often outstripped, and where the 
peasant for half the year lives like an Arctic explorer. Yet the very hardness 
of the struggle has made the Finn one of the sturdiest specimens of humanity 
— only the sturdy could survive; industry was the condition of his exist- 
ence; his loneliness has bred self-reliance, and his long solitudes have 
awakened faith. He has a natural bent for science; art has been born to 
him, vigorous and independent in quality; literature has by nature deep 
roots in the hearts of the men of these chilly, infertile lands. — Norman: 
All the Russias. 
Reading the map. With some care in questioning on the 
part of the teacher, the children may discover for themselves 
most of the following map facts or others equally signifi- 
cant: 
1. All of Finland is north of the 60th parallel. 
2. The Arctic Circle crosses Finland about two thirds 
of the way north. I don’t see how a country as far north as 
this could amount to much. 
8. Russia, Norway, and Sweden are the neighbors of 
Finland. 
4. There are so many lakes scattered over the country 
that it reminds me of New England. I wonder if the lakes of 
Finland were made by a great continental glacier, too. 
5. The map shows that Finland has a long coastal bound- 
ary. The boundary between Finland and Russia seems to 
be an irregular line that is not determined by natural 
features, except at Lake Ladoga. 
6. There are not many towns mapped in the northern 
part. 
7. They grow rye, oats, and barley here. I am sure it 
would be too cold for corn, but I wonder why they do not 
raise wheat. In the southeastern part they raise some cattle. 
What do they have to feed them? : 
8. Timber is found here. They could probably sell some 
lumber to Germany and to Britain, because both of those 
countries have not enough of their own. 
9. The rainfall map shows that the southern part of the 
country has enough rain for most field crops. 
10. The population map shows that there are more people 
around the coasts than in the interior.

11. The railroad lines are in the south and west only. 
One line follows the coast of the Gulf of Finland to Petrograd. 
12. Reindeer are found in the northern part. That would 
help provide meat for the people. 
Choosing an interest center. A statement in the child’s 
own words of something he would like to do or to know about 
a given area may become an interest center for the study. 
The following are typical: 
1. I should like to know how any one could live in such 
a country as this. 
2. Why are the Finns so much better educated than their 
neighbors, the Russians? 
8. How did the Finns gain their independence from 
Russia? 
4. What do Finns look like, and what are some of their 
customs? 
5. There are some Lapps in northern Finland. I should 
like to know more about them. 
6. How is a herd of reindeer cared for? Why does it pay 
to raise reindeer? 
7. How do the Finns make a living in such a cold 
country? 
Gathering data and grouping results around the interest 
center. The interest center chosen for this study is the 
seventh in the above series. The teacher should feel free to 
use any other which seems to appeal to the children. 
How do the Finns make a living in such a cold country? 
1. What opportunity is there here for farming? Judging 
from the soils, rainfall, and July temperature (isotherm 
map) of Finland, what are your conclusions regarding farm 
products? Is this a good pasture land? Reasons. (See 
Statesman’s Year-Book and encyclopedias for lists of farm 
crops and annual yield of each.) What fruits are found in 
Finland? How long are the summer days at Helsingfors? 
Does this fact help to explain some of the farm production? 
What means of transportation are afforded to the farmer 
for his dairy products and his crops? Notice on the map how 
the many lakes are connected with each other and with the
-P-A-G-E-191
  UNIT 18. FINLAND 185 
Gulf of Finland by canals. Are the markets near at hand? 
How does the farmer clear and drain his lands? 
2. Is mining extensive? Copper, iron, granite? Is coal 
found here? 
3. What opportunity is there for fishing? (Lakes, rivers, 
gulfs, kinds of fish.) 
4. Are the forests valuable? J. Russell Smith says in his 
Human Geography: “ Most of the farmers of Finland have 
two jobs, one for the winter and one for the summer season. 
In the summer they tend their little farms; in the winter 
they go into the forests and camp there. They chop wood 
and drag logs to the stream bank. In the spring the logs 
are floated down the stream, just as is done in the forests of 
New England. Then there is a rush of ships to the ports, 
to get loads of lumber, poles for coal mine props, and wood 
pulp for the paper mills.” 
What kinds of trees are found here? Where in North 
America is there a forest area like this? What European 
countries are greatly in need of lumber from Finland? What 
does each of these countries sell to Finland? (See Statesman’s 
Year-Book, 1921.) From the encyclopedias find out about 
water power and its development in Finland. In how 
many ways can such power be used in the Finnish lumber 
industry? What manufactures are possible in this country? 
5. Are the Finns an energetic people? The Finns are not 
Slavs, like the Russians or the Poles, but are related to the 
Mongolian race. Are Mongolians as a rule very energetic? 
What traits in common do you find in Finns and Chinese? 
How do they seem to differ? Is the climate of Finland 
energizing? What is its chief advantage? What are some of 
their pastimes in Finland? 
6. What kind of people are the Lapps, and how do they 
make a living? Are they as progressive as the Finns? Some 
years ago our government brought some Lapps to Alaska 
to teach the Eskimos there how to care for reindeer. Stef- 
ansson, a famous Arctic explorer, says that we shall all be 
eating reindeer meat as a regular article of diet in a few years. 
Does this give promise of greater markets to the Lapps?

  UNIT 19. JAPAN 
Time required: About 4 weeks 
Finding the starting point. What do you know about the 
Japanese in our own country? What kind of work do they 
do? How do they live? 
What Japanese articles do you have in your home? Have 
you read anything about earthquakes in Japan? volcanic 
eruptions? Recall the visit of Commodore Perry to the 
Japanese ports, as you read of it in history. Look up the 
date and something of the incident. This was the beginning 
of a miraculous change in Japan. In the seventy years 
which have passed since then, the country has been re- 
modeled into a modern nation. What did Commodore 
Perry do which helped to bring this about? Did you read 
about the Washington Naval Conference? Do you recall 
Japan’s rank among navies of the world? Do you have 
friends who have traveled in Japan? Perhaps they would 
answer some questions when we are ready to ask them defi- 
nitely. What Japanese cities can you name? Can you tell 
anything specific about any of these? Can you recall any 
famous Japanese men you have read or heard about? What 
is the sacred mountain of Japan? Recall accounts of Japa- 
nese victories in the war with China, or the war with Russia. 
What was Japan’s part in the World War? What difficulty 
has been encountered with regard to the Japanese on our 
Western coast? Do you know of some other countries that 
also try to keep the Japanese out of their lands? 
If we are thinking about the Japanese in a’ prejudiced 
way, would it not be fair play to forget everything preju- 
dicial, and to take up this study with but one purpose, to 
investigate whatever information is available so that we may 
learn to settle questions as fairly and justly as possible? 
That is what we wish the Japanese to do when they study 
about the United States in their schools. 
Reading the map. Before starting to read the map, 
outline the boundaries of the empire, then of Japan itself.

UNIT 19. JAPAN 189 
Pronounce aloud the names of the four southern islands. 
The children should then be led to discover the following 
facts for themselves: 
Japan _is made up of islands. It makes me think of Britain 
or of New Zealand. The island chain is very long. By the 
scale of miles it must be nearly 2000 miles from Formosa 
in the south to Sakhalin in the north. The latitude ranges 
from about 22 to 51 degrees. That means there is a great 
variety of climate here. All the islands seem to be moun- 
tainous. The map does not show many plains. I wonder 
if there are minerals in the mountains. These islands are 
east of the continent of Asia. I remember that we found it 
was a great advantage for islands to lie to the west of a 
continent, as in the case of Britain. I wonder if Japan 
is unfortunate in being east of the continent of Asia. (The 
teacher suggests here that when they talk about continental 
circulation, which causes monsoons, it will explain something 
of the effect the continent of Asia has on: the climate of 
Japan.) Japan is closest to Asia near Formosa and Korea 
and in northern Sakhalin. The rainfall map shows that most 
of Hondo gets 40 to 80 inches of rain. The island of Hondo 
(or Honshu) curves away from Asia. Japan is not very far 
from the Philippine Islands. The population map shows 
that Japan and Korea are densely crowded. The northern 
islands are not densely populated. It looks as if Sakhalin 
were almost empty of people. 
I can see that the coast of the islands is very much in- 
dented; this makes me think of Britain, too. I should expect 
many good harbors here. 
Japan faces the largest ocean. I think this might help to 
account for her slowness in getting into world commerce. 
The three southern islands of the main group (Kiushu, 
Shikoku, and Hondo) have more cities mapped on them than 
the others. There are some long, slender chains of islands 
that extend from the main chain — the Kurile Islands, to 
the northeast; and the Hansei, toward Formosa. 
I think Sakhalin would not be a very valuable possession 
to Japan, unless it has minerals. It is too far north. Since
-P-A-G-E-196
  190 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
Formosa is on the Tropic of Cancer, it might have a climate 
like Cuba. (The teacher again suggests that there is a new 
factor in the climate of Formosa which was not found in 
Cuba. This will be explained later. She says, however, that 
it has to do with the influence of the biggest continent and 
the biggest ocean.) Evidently, Korea (or Chosen) is a 
valuable possession. It is crowded with cities and looks as 
if it might have good harbors. It has many mountains, 
too; I wonder if they are forested. There are more railroads 
in Hondo than in the other islands. I do not see any rail- 
roads on Sakhalin. I can see on the economic map that 
silk, copper, tea, and rice are shipped out of Japan. They 
import cotton, wool, sugar, iron goods, and rice. Why do 
they export rice, if they import it too? The map shows that 
coal is sent from Nagasaki. I wonder if Japan has much 
coal. There are so many mountains here that I should expect 
the rivers to have many waterfalls. I wonder if there is 
much water power in the country. I should expect heavy 
rainfall on the islands. 
Finding some interest centers. Now that we have dis- 
cussed informally what we know about Japan, and have 
read the map, what are the interest centers, the things you 
would like to know or to do, with regard to Japan? The 
following will suggest themselves to most classes: 
I should like to find out just how the people live — to 
know about their dress, houses, games, customs, etc. I 
should like to make a special study of rice. I should like to 
model the island chain in sand and locate the largest cities, 
the most important mineral areas, and one or two mountain 
chains. I wonder how Japan got to be a world power, since 
its people are not of the white race. I should like to find out 
how Japan is governed. I should like to know more about 
the Japanese on our Western coast. I should like to find 
out just why the Japanese wish to emigrate, and I think 
it would be interesting to learn where they go and if they are 
welcome anywhere. I should like to find out why the Jap- 
anese wanted to own Chosen. And I think it would be 
interesting to find out of what value Formosa is to Japan.

Why are the Japanese so artistic? I should like to find out 
all I can about tea. Why is Japan so eager to get a foothold 
in China? Do the Japanese have good schools? The British 
are great sailors and fishermen. I should like to find out 
about the Japanese in that respect. Do they have a large 
army and navy? Are the islands easily defended? Why do 
people live where there are so many earthquakes and active 
volcanoes? How does it affect their everyday life? How 
much of these islands can be farmed? Does the climate 
favor farming? Are there many farmers in Japan? What 
are their leading crops? Why do so many nations wish to 
keep the Japanese out of their lands? What characteristics 
of the Japanese are there to admire? Do we trade much with 
Japan? Are there many great factories in Japan? What do 
they manufacture? We found much home manufacturing 
in Italy and Switzerland; is home manufacturing found in 
Japan? Are the people well educated? Do they have good 
schools? I should like to score Britain and Japan to see how 
they compare. I find in the Appendix of our textbook that 
Japan has an area of about 148,000 square miles and a 
population of more than 55 millions. I should like to know 
how so small a country can take care of so many people. 
Working out one of the interest centers. Select one 
or two interest centers which have been suggested by the 
children as a basis for general class study. Then permit 
small groups, or individuals, to work out other interest 
centers and ‘report on them to the class. Perhaps the last 
topic suggested might be chosen as the one for the class to 
use in committee of the whole. 
How can so small a country take care of so many people? 
Is this really a small country? With what countries may 
we compare it, to see if any other world powers are as small? 
How does it compare with Britain, France, Italy, in popu- 
lation? How many people are there to the square mile? 
Compare with the three countries mentioned before. In 
most countries with over 300 people to the square mile, 
what is the usual means of making a living? In Japan about 
65 per cent of the people live on farms, and these farms aver-

age only three acres each. Let us find some reasons why 
the farmers get a living on so small an area. Is the soil 
especially fertile? Is the climate very favorable to crops? 
Note the four climatic zones in the islands as follows 
(Journal of Geography, September, 1921): 
1. Northern zone. Here the ground is frozen in winter. 
Only summer agriculture is possible. This zone includes the 
northern part of the island of Hondo, and other islands to 
the north. Notice the population map, to see how sparsely 
this zone is settled. What crops are found here? Would a 
three-acre farm here support a Japanese family? 
2. Central zone. This includes most of the island of 
Hondo. We might call it the Tokyo area, the most pro- 
gressive part of Japan. Here two and even three crops a 
year are grown. What are these crops? How does the 
Japanese farmer make use of every inch of the land and keep 
the soil fertile? What use does he make of the hill lands? 
In Japan, one is never out of sight of mountains. There must 
then be much need to learn hill farming. Does the Japanese 
farmer have an easy time? 
8. Southern zone. This is the Nagasaki area. Here 
three crops a year are grown. What are they? 
4. Tropical zone. The tropical zone includes the island 
of Formosa, which lies off the Chinese coast and was origi- 
nally a part of China. What is the chief agricultural product 
of Formosa? 
Is the monsoon an advantage to Japan? Explain how the 
continent of Asia disturbs the world-wind scheme and causes 
a continental circulation. (See ante, Unit 9, South America.) 
The seasonal winds thus produced are called monsoons. 
Monsoon lands are usually very densely populated. Can 
you suggest five reasons why this is so? (Smith: Commerce 
and Industry; page 441.) Why do summer-rain areas have 
denser population than winter-rain areas? 
Is the climate in the more crowded part of Japan such 
that warm houses and much fuel for heating are required? 
Are the Japanese houses heated to as high a temperature 
as ours in cold weather? What materials for clothing
-P-A-G-E-199
UNIT 19. JAPAN 193 
are produced in Japan? Is heavy winter clothing required? 
What clothing materials are imported? 
Are there many meat animals here? dairy animals? beasts 
of burden? Account for this. How is farm work done? 
What meat substitute is found here? How do the Japanese 
get along without butter and milk? How is the lack of 
leather for shoes, etc., overcome? What use is made of 
paper and straw? 
It may be necessary for the Japanese farmer to find some 
other means of income for part of the year. This suggests 
the type of home manufacture often found in crowded lands. 
Tell how the silk industry is carried on in small peasant 
homes. What other home work is taken up? How does 
tea growing provide work for many laborers? rice farm- 
ing? 
Write a page telling how a very small farm can support 
a Japanese family. 
Why is Japan being driven to develop manufacturing? 
Is there much coal for power? Has water power been 
developed? What raw materials are at hand for manu- 
facture? What materials are imported? Where are the 
markets for Japanese wares? Is Japan in the line of heavy 
ocean traffic? of coastwise trade? Has Japan a merchant 
marine? Are the Japanese skilled workmen? In what type 
of manufacture do they excel? In what respect do they 
remind you of the French? Explain in some detail the 
process of silk manufacture. 
How are peasant homes built? Do the earthquakes 
shake them down? About how much capital is required to 
build and furnish a house? What is the usual menu in a 
Japanese peasant’s home? Is this food imported, or is it 
largely raised at home? Does the English workman secure 
most of the food that is placed on his table from farms in 
the vicinity, or is it largely imported? Why is there this 
difference? Rice is the most widely used human food. Is 
it a perfect food? What is used to supplement it? 
As one family after another in the crowded areas desires 
to improve conditions of living, what will probably happen?
-P-A-G-E-200
  194 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
As a rule, are the people educated? fond of travel? Do you 
think some of them should emigrate? What lands are open 
to them? What sparsely settled lands are most conveniently 
located? What is the relation of the Japanese to China? 
to Siberia? to Australia? to South Africa? to South Amer- 
ica? to Mexico? Why do we not encourage them to settle 
on our Pacific coast? Summarize reasons to show why 
Japan can support so dense a population.

In what points are they very different? Can you explain 
now why Japan is called a world power? 
Comparing people. Another comparison might be made 
between Japanese people and Americans, to show how they 
differ from us in many points. Perhaps it will help us to 
understand them better if we identify some differences in 
thought and in training. (See Literary Digest, January 7, 
1922.)

  UNIT 20. THE CHINESE REPUBLIC 
Time required: About 4 weeks 
Finding the starting point. The teacher may start an 
informal discussion by mentioning such subjects as the fol- 
lowing: The Chinese we know in America. Why do they 
come here? What work do they do here? Do they expect 
to spend all their lives here, or do they plan to go back 
home? Have any of your friends traveled in China? Have 
you read any books on Chinese life? How many of these 
words do you know: coolie, sampan, mandarin, sedan chair, 
pidgin English, pagoda, chopsticks, junk, Manchu, queue? 
In history, do you recall stories of the Boxer Rebellion? 
What Chinese customs do you know? Have you read about 
the Great Wall of China? Do you know that the Chinese 
are given credit for such inventions as gunpowder, printing, 
silk making, chinaware? Can you name others? Of course 
tea and rice and silk remind you of China. Does kite 
flying? Is there a breed of chickens that is Chinese? Is 
that surprising when China is second in the world in the 
production of chickens and eggs? Do you recall any Chinese 
or Mongolian heroes, as, for instance, Genghis Khan, 
Tamerlane, Confucius, and General Wang? 
Reading the map. Before beginning the individual search 
for map facts, have the whole class trace the outline of the 
Chinese Republic. Note that this great country is made up 
of five regions: Manchuria, Mongolia, Eastern Turkestan 
(Singkian), Tibet, and China proper. If we speak of the 
Chinese Republic, we include all these areas. If we speak 
of China, we mean that southeastern part of the republic 
which is China proper. This map is difficult but fascinating. 
Its facts are not so easily discovered as are those of the map 
of Canada, for instance, but the children will find some very 
significant and far-reaching truths. Encourage them, in 
this map especially, to search for comparisons and inferences; 
to say ‘“‘that reminds me” and “I wonder why.” The 
197  
-P-A-G-E-204
  198 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
following may be readily brought out in class discussions 
and readings: 
It looks to me as if the Chinese Republic took up one fourth 
of the whole continent. It has a surprisingly short coast 
line for its area. Think how much coast line the United 
States has, and it is not so large. The coast is not very much 
indented. I do not see any long drowned valleys like 
Chesapeake Bay or Delaware Bay. There is no very promi- 
nent projection, except Shantung. The coast line looks so 
straight, and the land back of it is a plain. I think, then, 
that the water off the coast is rather shallow. I do not 
believe there would be many good harbors here. The 
Gulf of Pechili is the greatest indentation. I wonder if the 
greatest ports are there. Perhaps it is too far north for the 
heaviest trade. One seaport, Hongkong, belongs to Britain. 
I wonder why. Most of the boundary lines of the republic 
are very crooked. Some of the boundaries are mountain 
chains — the Tien Shan, the Sayan, and the Himalayas. 
The Amur River also forms part of the boundary of Man- 
churia. Manchuria is almost entirely cut off from the coast 
by Korea and a part of Siberia. This makes me think of the 
west coast of Canada, with the long stretch of Alaska cut- 
ting off part of it from the Pacific. Most of the cities of 
the Chinese Republic are in China; there are very few in 
Mongolia, Turkestan, and Tibet. Mongolia has a desert in 
it —the Gobi; so has Turkestan — the Taklamakan. Since 
there are so many mountains and high plateaus, and such 
large deserts, there must be a lot of waste land in the Chinese 
Republic. I wonder if the mountains and deserts acted as 
a fence to keep people out of China. There are some very 
long rivers here, but they loop about so, it is hard to trace 
them. (The teacher asks them to trace two, the Hoang and 
the Yangtze, because these rivers play a prominent part in 
Chinese life.) 
I can trace the Great Wall between China and Mongolia. 
Pekin is in about the same latitude as New York. China 
reaches from the Tropic of Cancer to 50 degrees north. It 
has almost the same latitudes as the United States, from
-P-A-G-E-205
  UNIT 20. THE CHINESE REPUBLIC 199 
Florida to Maine, but is a little farther north and south. 
I wonder if there are as many kinds of climate in China as 
in the United States. I see the Grand Canal connecting the 
Hoang and the Yangtze. It must be a long one. The map 
shows me that the Yangtze is a mountain stream in its 
upper reaches and a wide river of the plains in its lower 
course. That reminds me of the Missouri. The population 
map shows that the coastal part of China is very densely 
populated. Mongolia has the fewest people of any region 
in the Chinese Republic. I have been looking at a population 
map of the United States, and I find that the most crowded 
part of China is farther south than the most crowded part 
of the United States; I wonder why. China is divided into 
many irregular-shaped provinces. The rainfall map tells 
me that the crowded part of China has a rainfall of from 20 
to 80 inches. Most of the crowded area of China has mild 
winters and hot summers, according to the temperature 
map. I wonder if the mild winters and hot summers do 
not help to explain why so many people can live in that 
part of China? I find that much of Tibet is always cold. 
Much of Mongolia has hot summers and cold winters. I 
find summer rainfall is common throughout most of China, 
although the southeastern part seems to have two rainy 
seasons. I suppose that they can raise more than one crop, 
then. 
Discovering interest centers. 
1. Why is China proper so densely settled when the other 
four areas are so sparsely settled? 
2. What effect does it have on people to be so crowded? 
8. What hope is there for China to become a world 
power? 
4. Why is Japan so far ahead of China? 
5. Can the different people of the republic understand 
each other’s language? 
6. Why are there so many farmers here? 
7. Just how do they farm in China? How does it 
differ from our farming? 
8. Why are the people so poor?

  9. What do they eat? 
10. I should like to find out how folks live on house boats. 
11. I should like to tell about the Hoang River and why 
it is called “ China’s Sorrow.” 
12. Why have Manchuria and China proper so much more 
rain than the other three provinces? 
13. Are there too many people trying to live in China 
proper? Why don’t they move out into the sparsely settled 
districts? 
14. How do the Chinese feel toward the United States? 
I should like to read about that. 
15. Why are there so few railroads? 
16. Does China have coal and iron? 
17. Could all the people of this republic get together 
and form a united government? 
18. Were the Chinese ready for a republican form of 
government? 
19. Why are North and South China disagreeing? Is it 
anything like our North and South before the Civil War? 
20. I should like to read something about the Great Wall. 
21. I should like to find out about the trade of China. 
Do we trade much with her? 
22. I should like to find out about some of the strange 
customs of the Chinese. 
23. Why was China secluded from the rest of the world 
for so many years? Why did she not pick up Western civi- 
lization as rapidly as Japan? 
24. T should like to find out just what are China’s greatest 
needs. 
25. I should like to compare China and the United States. 
26. Why was China once a leader in civilization, and why 
is she now so backward? 
Working out some interest centers. What chance has 
China to become a world power ? 
Here is a great country, larger than the United States. 
It has four hundred million people living in it. In spite of 
its enormous extent and great population, it counts for very 
little in world affairs. It has continually been interfered
-P-A-G-E-207
  
UNIT 20. THE CHINESE REPUBLIC 201 
with by foreign powers. Its government is unstable, and 
its people seem to be in confusion. Let us see what chance 
there is for China to gain a stronger position among the 
powers. 
What do we need to find out in order to talk about this 
subject fairly? One boy suggests, “I think we ought to 
find out what the people are like.” Another says, “ And I 
think we ought to know what their country is like, as well.” 
A third says, ““ We ought to find out what the rest of the 
world thinks of China — that is, how it treats China and 
how China feels toward it.” With these very natural 
questions as an outline, the study proceeds somewhat as 
follows: 
1. What are the people of China like physically? Stature, 
build, complexion, health (high death rate mentioned), 
resistance to disease, endurance, energy, daily food of com- 
mon people (largely vegetarian). Quality and quantity of 
food, standards of living, results of the terrible struggle for 
existence in this crowded land. (See Ross, E. A.: The 
Changing Chinese, Chapter 4.) What physical type is 
common in Tibet? How does it differ from that found in 
Mongolia or Turkestan? Summarize favorable and un- 
favorable points in this discussion. Reach a conclusion 
as to whether the Chinese are physically equal to other 
peoples who have gained the rank of a world power. 
2. What are the intellectual and moral traits of the 
Chinese? Patient, polite, peaceful, abhorrent of the use 
of force, reliable, likable, quick to learn, good-natured, 
very proud of race and family, little individualism, thrifty, 
very industrious (some one has said that the Chinese have 
an appetite for work), very fond of children and of their 
homes, have high regard for education, superstitious, 
temperate, largely illiterate (90 per cent of the common 
people cannot read), inexperienced in popular government, 
not trained to be public-spirited, not inclined to travel about 
and see other sorts of people, conservative (many of them 
believe all wisdom was given to the ancients), religious, etc. 
What traits here are to be admired? to be corrected? 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  202 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
3. What are the social conditions under which the people 
live? Crowded areas; insanitary cities; weak and irre- 
sponsible government; very few railroads, except in eastern 
provinces; few good roads (most of the highways are mere 
footpaths: the wheelbarrow is the most common vehicle); 
no system of public schools; few newspapers or magazines; 
little public control of health, sanitation, highways, street 
lighting, or water supply; poverty of the masses; danger 
of famine and plague; need for flood control of rivers; etc. 
Customs which hinder: foot binding, among women; low 
position of woman; ancestor worship; cumbersome method 
of writing; superstitious practices; etc. Recent improve- 
ments: highways and railroads now being constructed; agi- 
tation against foot binding; governmental adoption of 
phonetic alphabet; education of many Chinese students in 
foreign universities; establishment of schools; education 
of girls slowly beginning; river and harbor improvement; 
ete. 
4. How do the people make a living? Since more than 
80 per cent of the people are dependent on agriculture, 
farming is the industry we should study first. 
Size of the farms, character of the soils, leading crops 
(North China: millet, wheat, vegetables, soy beans, 
forage. South China: rice, cotton, mulberries, wheat, tea, 
etc.). Amount of food produced on farms? Why is crop 
yield per acre higher in China than in the United States? 
Methods of intensive agriculture: careful fertilization; 
rotation of crops; multiple cropping (in South China as 
many as seven crops a year); use of dry-farming methods; 
supplemental irrigation; terracing uplands; draining low- 
lands. Difficulty in transportation of farm products. 
Wheat may be 10 cents a bushel at Chenfu, in the eastern 
province of Szechuan, and $2.50 a bushel at Shanghai. 
Does a railroad connect these points? Most of the farmers 
own their farms. Is this a good thing? How is the bamboo 
helpful to the Chinese farmer? “Imagine how he would 
pity an American farmer, with no clumps of bamboo to make 
things with, no soy beans, and no persimmons,” says a
-P-A-G-E-209
  
UNIT 20. THE CHINESE REPUBLIC 208 
writer in Asia. What harm has been done by deforestation? 
Read about grazing in Mongolia, Tibet, Turkestan. 
Manufacturing is developing slowly. Why? Home in- 
dustries: silk making, cotton and woolen weaving, straw 
weaving and braiding, rug making, preparing tea for market. 
Industrial plants: These have been established for the man- 
ufacture of textiles, brass and iron work, flour, glass, porce- 
lain, soap, ete. Conditions favoring manufacture: cheap 
and willing labor, raw materials. What raw materials for 
manufacture are found in China? Has China abundant coal 
for power? (China ranks next to the United States and Can- 
ada in the amount of available coal. The province of Shansi 
has much anthracite coal, much iron ore, and is one of the 
richest copper areas in the world. Look on the map to see if 
Shansi has railroads.) 
Are markets convenient for manufactured goods? In 
this crowded land would the home demand be great? For 
what goods especially? Could China compete with other 
manufacturing nations in getting world markets? Would 
she be able to compete with Japan? Why has Japan de- 
veloped manufactures so much more rapidly? What have 
been the chief hindrances to industrial development in 
China? Large-scale manufacturing calls for the organization 
of big companies. Why is this difficult in China? 
' 5. What is the country of the Chinese like? Recall map 
facts which help in this problem. How is it located with 
regard to the leading nations of the world? Is it on im- 
portant land highways? Is it accessible to leading ocean 
highways? About how far is it from the United States? 
Britain? Japan? Are its neighbors generally progressive? 
friendly? Are its boundaries natural, in the main? Would 
the country be easily defended? Is the great size of the 
area a help or a hindrance? How does it affect the spread 
of Western civilization? Compare with Japan in this regard. 
Are the surface features and their arrangement favorable 
to the development of the Chinese Republic? Notice that 
the highlands lie to the west and the plains area is nearly all 
in the east. There is no great central plain such as we found
-P-A-G-E-210
  204 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
in the United States. Is this plan of surface features a good 
one? Does it favor unity? Is communication easy through- 
out the republic? How do the rivers help? Do they help to 
determine density of population? Would it not be interesting 
to compare the surface of this country with Russia? What 
do you notice? Russians, on their great open plain, are much 
alike in language, customs, and ideas the country over. 
Is this true of the people of the Chinese Republic? Is the 
coast the best type for numerous harbors? How do the 
river mouths help? Are the rivers tidal? What minerals, 
essential to industrial development, are found here? Recall 
the great prairies of Manchuria and Mongolia waiting for 
pioneers. Will this help? What timber lands are found 
* here? | 
Is the climate favorable to the development of human 
energy and to the production of food crops? Recall how the 
summer monsoon gives a growing season; the winter mon- 
soon a ripening and recuperative season. Describe the 
continental climate of Manchuria, ibngolia, and Turkestan; 
the effect of high altitudes in Tibet; the monsoon climate 
of much of China proper. What advantages does a country 
supporting a dense population derive from a monsoon 
climate? How does the climate of southeastern China differ 
from that of southeastern United States? How do the two 
areas compare in density of population? 
Is the government firm and responsible? When did China 
become a republic? What form of government did the 
Chinese have before? Are they united in maintaining a 
good government? What are the chief differences between 
North and South China? What do the people of Mongolia 
fear from the central: government? Are the Tibetans in 
sympathy with the Chinese? How does the feeling of strong 
family ties often hinder China from getting the right 
kind of officials? Bribery seems to be practiced very gen- 
erally. Would the hard struggle for existence help to explain 
this situation? Has China a large army? a navy? 
6. What are China’s relations with other great nations?

your history the account of John Hay and the “ Open 
Door ” policy. Wasn’t this a case of ‘“‘ when a feller 
needs a friend”? How about the Boxer indemnity? 
What did China do with this money after it was 
returned to her? How has our country helped China 
in times of famine? What was our attitude in regard 
to the return of Shantung after the World War? No 
doubt China’s sincere admiration for the United 
States made her wish to become a republic. How is 
the United States helping China in her fight against 
opium? 
(b) Japan. What difficulties or jealousies have arisen 
between the two nations? 
(c) European countries. What countries have seized 
parts of China? Should China be divided among 
European powers, as Africa was? 
Summary. Looking over all the facts you have found in 
your study of China, reach conclusions as to which points 
are favorable and which are unfavorable to China’s becoming 
a world power.. On the whole, what chance has she? John 
Hay said, ‘‘ Whoever understands China, socially, politically, 
economically, and religiously, holds the key to world politics 
for the next five centuries.” What do you think he meant? 
Children’s activities. Suggest five recommendations you 
would make to China for needed improvements. Plan a 
pageant, portraying each one of the provinces of the Chinese 
Republic. A group represents Mongolia by description, 
pantomime, etc. Another group selects representative scenes 
from Turkestan, a third from Tibet, and so on.

UNIT 21. THE INDIAN EMPIRE 
Time required: About 4 weeks 
Suggestions for an introductory discussion of India. 
Have you read or heard something about caste in the Hindu 
religion, and how it affects the people of India? Have 
you seen pictures of the Taj Mahal? Do you know its 
story? Have you read the Jungle Book? any other of 
Kipling’s stories or poems which tell about India? Do you 
know persons who have been there? We seldom see natives of 
India in our country, although it is not unusual to see Chinese 
and Japanese. We wonder why India furnishes most of the 
gunny sacks in which grain is shipped. Could we use sacks 
made of cotton instead? Most of us know that India 
raises tea. What other articles are raised that we use com- 
monly? 
Just offhand, what are some of your present impressions 
about India? Is it large or small? crowded or sparsely 
settled? highly civilized? independent politically? What 
ideas have you as to its general type of climate? Have you 
ever wished to visit India? Why? 
Have stories of the history of this unusual country reached 
you, as, for instance, the Siege of Lucknow? the Black Hole 
of Calcutta? the East India Company? accounts of Indian 
soldiers in the World War? One native soldier of India who 
did good service in France told some of our American boys 
that the thing that impressed him most in all Europe was 
the fine breeds of cattle, Can you give any explanation of that 
statement now? If not, you will see it very clearly after a 
little study of this remarkable country. _ Have you heard 
of some terrible famines in India? 
What do you know about teakwood? Some persons think 
it is the most valuable wood in the world. You will be 
interested in finding out about it. Do you recall what 
Kipling says about “‘ Elephants a-piling teak, in the squdgy 
wudgy creek”? Rattan, used for chair seats, is found 
here also, especially in Burma. You recall that the

United States Rubber Company, and other great rubber 
companies in our country, are buying much of their raw 
rubber from the plantations of southeast Asia, rather than 
from the areas of wild rubber in South America. In Ceylon 
(not part of the Indian Empire, but close to it geographi- 
cally) you will find some of the most valuable tea and 
rubber plantations in the world. Have you read anything 
about airplane exploration of the Himalayas? Think over 
the various subjects we have talked about in this intro- 
ductory discussion. Tell me the items you now think you 
will be most interested in. 
Here is a list of interesting words that come to my mind 
when I think of India: fakir, punkah, bazaar, juggler, mosque, 
pagoda, caste, pariah, rattan, cashmere, water buffalo, cobra, 
teakwood, sesamum, indigo, etc. How many of these do you 
know already? 
Reading the map. India is a large peninsula, the middle 
one of the three which extend southward from the continent 
of Asia. It has mountains and the sea for its boundaries. 
I should think it could be easily defended. It has an irregular 
central plain, which runs east and west across the top of the 
peninsula. That makes me think of the Lombardy plain. 
I wonder if it is as important to India as the Lombardy 
plain is to Italy. The southern part of the peninsula is a 
plateau. It reminds me of Mexico, with its high interior 
and narrow coastal plains. Mountains border the peninsula 
on the east and the west. The Western Ghats are probably 
the highest, because I notice that the longer rivers flow 
toward the east. I see by the political map that the Indian 
Empire extends beyond the Bay of Bengal and takes in 
Burma. The population map shows that most of the country 
is densely settled, especially in the plains. There is a desert, 
the Tharr, near the western end of the plain. When I look 
again at the population map, I can see that the area of least 
population is located in that desert. Another area of sparse 
population is in Burma, and a third is on the plateau in the 
southern part of the peninsula. The rainfall map shows that 
a certain area along the Himalayas has more than 80 inches  
-P-A-G-E-215
UNIT 21. THE INDIAN EMPIRE ‘209 
  of rain. Another region of heavy rainfall is along the western 
coast, and another is near the coast in Burma. According 
to the rainfall map, most of India has summer rain. I 
have been looking at the seacoast, and I don’t believe it is 
good for harbors. It is too regular. The Western and the 
Eastern Ghats lie so close to the coast, that I would infer 
there is not much chance for harbors. The Ganges River 
has a very large delta. According to the railroad map, India 
has more railroads than any other country of Asia. There 
are not many islands around India. I wonder if the people 
are good seamen or are much interested in the sea. (The 
teacher suggests that the great extent of plains might keep 
their interest on farming instead.) By the scale of miles, 
India is about 1800 miles from north to south, and a little 
more from east to west. India is so close to the equator that 
I should expect it to be very warm everywhere, except in the 
mountains. Much of India is in the torrid zone, but it has 
the sea on two sides. That ought to moderate the heat 
somewhat, if it receives its winds from over the sea. Balu- 
chistan is made up of mountains and plateaus and does not 
have a very dense population. 
Some interest centers which children suggest. I have 
always heard that the people of India are very poor. I 
should like to find out why. I should like to find out just 
how the common people live, what they eat, what kind of 
houses they live in, etc. How can so many people live here? 
The area is a little more than half that of the United States, 
and the population is three times as great as ours. I should 
like to know why they have so many beggars. Why are 
there so many famines? I should like to find out about the 
interesting wild animals—tigers and elephants — and 
snakes, etc. I should like to model India in sand and de- 
scribe its different physical regions. I have always had a 
curiosity to know more about the Himalaya Mountains. 
Why is not this large country independent? -Is it good for 
India to be controlled by the British, or not? How are 
women treated in India? Just what is the caste system, and 
what does it mean in the everyday life of the people? I
-P-A-G-E-216
210 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
  will find out more about the Taj Mahal. I am going to look 
up the subject of teakwood and see how they use elephants 
in handling the logs. Why has Burma so sparse a popu- 
lation? I cannot see how England governs this great coun- 
try. Why, it has more than six times the population that 
Britain has! Do the people of India emigrate to other lands? 
Do other countries want them to come? Why do we see 
so few of them in our country? 
Working out one of the problems. Several of the interest 
centers mentioned would prove to be excellent problems for 
this area. The outstanding facts with regard to India are 
its arrangement of physical regions into a pattern which 
has not favored unity among its people; its avenues of 
approach by land and sea, the Khyber Pass on the northwest, 
and the forested path into China in the northeast; its 
invasion by different races; the political, religious, and 
economic diversity of its peoples; the extreme fertility and 
endurance of its wide areas of good soils; the influence of 
its summer rain and of its constant high temperatures; a 
land that juts into the sea but is not of the sea; a people 
who are land-minded and not seafaring; a land crowded to 
the very margin of existence by a farming people, illiterate, 
weakened by their “ mosquito climate ” until their physical 
energy is scarcely three fourths that of the European or 
American; dominated politically by a small island kingdom 
of the temperate zone; with remnants of an ancient civili- 
zation and culture in some lines unsurpassed; with leaders 
arising whose intellectual and spiritual leadership cannot be 
questioned. An ancient people, difficult for the Western 
mind fully to understand, whose qualities of mind and soul 
we cannot but admire. (See Fairgrieve: Geography and 
World Power.) 
Select some one of the interest centers mentioned by the 
class, as a basis for a problem study, as, for instance, the 
following: India is the second most populous country in the 
world ; its territory is large and rich. Why is it not independent ? 
The class and the teacher should outline the problem to- 
gether, using the following suggestions: What does a country
-P-A-G-E-217
  
UNIT 21. THE INDIAN EMPIRE 211 
need in order to be independent? “It needs to have good 
boundaries, so that it will be easily defended,” says one. 
“Tt needs to have its people all united and working to- 
gether,” says a second. And it needs good farming land and 
a good climate so that it can raise food enough for its people. 
It ought to have coal and iron. It ought to have good schools 
so that all its people can be educated. If it is on the coast, 
it ought to have a good navy and a merchant marine. It 
ought to haye an army. It ought to have good leaders. It 
ought to have railroads and good roads so that the people 
can get together easily. It ought to have good sanitation 
so that the people will be healthy. It ought to have its people 
of the white race. (The teacher questions the narrowness of 
this requirement, and suggests that one purpose in the study 
of geography is to overcome any form of race prejudice.) 
Let us arrange a series of questions about India, the an- 
swers to which will help us to decide whether she has the 
necessary requirements for independence. 
1. Is India well located for independence? Are most lands 
in the same latitude as that of India self-governed? Is it 
in a good neighborhood for advance in civilization? for 
trade? Is it on important commercial highways? (The 
Suez-Singapore sea route should be discussed, and the 
Indus-Ganges land route; the Khyber Pass and its route, 
etc.) What are its busiest seaports? What is the character 
of their harbors? (See encyclopedias.) Do the railroads 
center at any of these seaports? What parts of India have 
the thickest network of railroads? What parts the least? 
Summarize in a paragraph your conclusions as to India’s 
opportunities for business relations with other lands, based 
on her situation with regard to trade routes. In this sum- 
mary mention distances between India and Britain, the 
United States, Japan. On the whole, what effect will this 
have on her gaining independence? 
2. Does the arrangement of physical features favor unity? 
Are the boundaries natural or largely artificial? Is India 
easily invaded? Are there peoples in neighboring areas who 
might covet India’s rich lands? Has India been often  
-P-A-G-E-218
  212 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
invaded? (Huntington: Asia; A Geography Reader, page 
310.) What kind of a boundary do the Himalayas make? 
the swamps and jungles of the eastern plain? the border 
mountains and the coast lines of the peninsula? Is travel 
easy between remote parts of the empire, as from Baluchistan 
to Calcutta? from the western Himalayas to Madras? The 
Chinese very early made much use of their rivers for trans- 
portation. Was this true in India? The Chinese plain is 
coastal, while the Indian plain cuts across country, east and 
west. Which situation seems more favorable for holding the 
people together? Would the people of the plateau in the 
peninsula (the Deccan) associate freely with the people of 
the plain? with the people of the coast? Would their 
interests be similar? Would there be a close connection be- 
tween the people of Bombay and Rangoon? (Fairgrieve 
suggests that the natural divisions are too large to favor 
unity.) 
8. Are the soils of India capable of producing sufficient 
food crops and other crops for the population? Turn to the 
physical map of India, and notice carefully the great plain. 
How many rivers do you find? Where do they rise? In 
descending the steep slopes of the Himalayas, would they 
pick up much of a load of sand, soil, and gravel? Where 
would this load be deposited? How would this affect the 
plains? Is new soil being constantly brought down from the 
mountains? Can you find a statement as to the depth of 
alluvial soils in places on the plain? Describe such soils 
as to fertility, endurance, etc. 
Turn to Burma on the map, and notice the rivers, flowing 
almost parallel southward. Where do they rise? Do they 
carry much of a load? What soils do you expect here? 
Where, along the watercourses, will the widest and deepest 
alluvium be found? Where do you find the largest cities 
in Burma? The Indus-Ganges plain is said to be the most 
extensive sheet of level cultivation in the world. What have 
you noticed as to its population? its railroads? its cities? 
What is the area of this plain? About how wide is it? 
If vou could stand on some high roof and look across it,
-P-A-G-E-219
UNIT 21. THE INDIAN EMPIRE 213 
how do you think it would impress you? What is the most 
level land you ever saw? Why is level land favorable to 
most types of farming? What are the leading crops grown 
here? Where is the best wheat area? 
Look at the plateau of the peninsula. Will you expect the 
same soils here as in the plains? In many places here are 
found excellent lava soils. Where are wide areas of lava 
soils found in the United States? What are the crops of the 
plateau? 
Write two or three paragraphs on soils in India. Judging 
by her soils, could India produce great crops? How would 
this affect her chances for independence? 
4. Is the climate of India such as to favor the growing of 
heavy crops? the development of human energy? 
Judging by the latitudes, what can you infer as to the 
angle of insolation; that is, the height of the noon sun in 
the sky, in winter as well as in summer? What can you infer 
as to the length of the days? Will there be much change in 
the length of days in summer and in winter? What difference 
would this make as to warmth? Fairgrieve says, ‘“‘ Nearly 
the whole of India is warmer in winter than any part of 
China.” Name three places in India where this would not 
be true. Why? Find some statements in your textbooks 
as to the heat and its effect on Europeans or Americans who 
go there to live. When is the hottest season? Why? 
See isotherm maps for January and July temperatures. 
About two thirds of India has a monsoon climate. Explain 
what that means. How does it affect the rainfall? What is 
the general wind direction in June? in December? Why 
does this change occur? Where is the heaviest rainfall in 
India (see rainfall map)? the least? About what fraction 
of India has enough rain for crops? Sometimes the monsoon 
fails to bring rain. Result? We often have seasons in the 
United States when wheat, corn, or potato crops are very 
poor. Why does this not cause a fearful famine here? Find 
a description of the coming of the monsoon and of the re- 
joicing of the farmers when it arrives. Why are three fifths 
of the people farmers?  
-P-A-G-E-220
  214 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
What effect has the hot rainy summer on health and 
energy? Would mosquitoes thrive here? How do they en- 
danger life? What advantage does the dry season give? 
In what parts of India are the people at their best physically? 
In a brief write-up on the climate of India, summarize its 
effects on the people who live there. Does it tend to develop 
a self-governing people? Most of the native Indian people 
belong to our race. Account for difference in development. 
5. What kind of people live in India? Are they all of 
one race, or are they of different races? To what race do 
the Hindus belong? Why is this white race so dark-skinned? 
Can you think of any reasons why there are so many races, 
languages, and religions in India? How has the diversity of 
races developed the caste system? Does the caste system 
encourage or discourage self-government? Why are so many 
“holy men ” supported in idleness? Are most of the people 
educated? What per cent cannot read? (95 per cent.) 
What other hindrances are there to their immediate inde- 
pendence? Are the people energetic, full of initiative? 
What great attainments have they made in art and in 
literature? Nowhere on earth is there such poverty as in 
India; a great part of the population is always destitute. 
Suggest four or five reasons for this condition. 
What is the density of population per square mile? Com- 
pare with Britain, China, the United States. What effect 
does this overcrowding have on Indian standards of living? 
What per cent of the people live on farms? Describe the 
home of a farmer in the Ganges Valley — his house, furniture, 
food, clothing,’some of his customs. Is his house on his 
farm land or in a near-by village? About how large is his 
farm? Does he own the land, or does he rent it? What crop 
does he raise? What live stock does he keep? Why are 
there so many cattle and goats here? How does the farmer 
manage to raise more than one crop a year? Recall that irri- 
gation is more extensively practiced in India than anywhere 
else in the world. Why should areas having a sufficient rain- 
fall develop an elaborate irrigation scheme? Can the farmers 
of India raise food enough for all the population, or must
-P-A-G-E-221
  
UNIT 21. THE INDIAN EMPIRE 215 
they import some? What oilseeds are grown here that we 
are not familiar with? Why do most of the people have an 
exclusively vegetarian diet? 
Is manufacturing well developed? Along what lines? What 
essential minerals are found here? The coal output is about 
19 million tons a year. Is this a large amount? On the 
whole, is India as well supplied with coal, iron, and copper 
as China? Has India much water power? Where are the 
leading factories? Why are there not more? What raw 
materials are sent out of the country to be manufactured? 
Why is there so heavy an export of jute, hides and skins, 
and cotton? Would famines be so serious in India if there 
were more people engaged in manufacturing? Judging by 
their raw materials, and by the home demand for manu- 
factured goods, what manufactures could develop here? 
What home manufacturing is carried on? Describe how the 
village people make their own dishes, jars, ete. How does 
the caste system hinder the development of manufacturing? 
At present, India is undergoing a great industrial change. 
Give some reasons for this. 
6. Can you find out how the British came to control 
India? Why do not the 300 million people rise up in re- 
bellion against the few British officials that control them? 
Do the English keep a large army in India to subdue the 
natives? How do they govern the land? In what ways have 
the English greatly benefited India? (Methods of irrigation, 
development of manufactures, building railroads and high- 
ways, establishing schools, providing a stable government, 
improving sanitation, opening up mines, furnishing a 
market for goods, encouraging shipping.) Can you add two 
more to this list? 
Making a summary. In one column list all the points 
favorable to the independence of India; in another column, 
the unfavorable points. Draw your conclusions from this. 
Eventually India will become self-governing. What changes 
are needed before this takes place? 
Some fact questions. Where would you go in India or 
Ceylon to see cotton growing? cotton mills? wheat fields?  
-P-A-G-E-222
  216 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
rubber plantations? teakwood forests? the most crowded 
area? the wettest area? the driest region? great swamps? 
forest jungles? the most beautiful valley in the world? 
a sacred city? the largest city? the most beautiful building 
in the world? 
Suggestions for children’s activities. Arrange for dif- 
ferent members of the class to give short talks on such 
subjects as: (a) a Hindu school, (6) preparing a meal in 
India, (c) a visit to a bazaar, (d) travel on Indian railway 
trains, (e) logging with elephants in Burma, (f) the story 
of a common gunny sack, (g) my experiences as a high 
caste girl (or boy), (h) my visit to Calcutta, (i) my visit to 
Bombay, (j) interesting animals of India, (k) my visit to 
the happy people of Burma, (J) story of a Burman woman, 
(m) story of a Hindu woman, (n) a rubber plantation in 
Ceylon, (0) rice farming in Burma, (p) the story of the 
Taj Mahal, (¢) India’s great poet, Rabindranath Tagore, 
(r) India’s reformer, Ghandi.

UNIT 22. AFRICA 
Time required: 6 to 8 weeks’ 
  Finding the starting point. Before we open our textbooks 
and reference books to find out about our new unit of study, 
let us talk over what we already know. 
In thinking of Africa, some of us will be reminded first 
that it is a famous hunting ground, the home of big game. 
What animals do you recall first? Why can these live here? 
Have you heard travelers or missionaries tell of life in 
Africa? What impressed you most? What movies have you 
seen? Have you read stories of Livingstone and Stanley? 
of Kitchener of Khartum? of Jan Smuts and the Boer 
War? of what South Africa did in the World War? of the 
pirates of the Barbary States and how the United States 
treated them? 
Do you recall any accounts of Liberia, the negro republic? 
What President of the United States helped this republic to 
get a start? What stories of the slave trade in America do 
you recall? Can you tell where in Africa most of our former 
negro slaves came from? Where are most of our American 
negroes living now? 
Do you know any Rhodes scholars? What have you heard 
about Cecil Rhodes? Oom Paul Kruger? Have you read 
something about the Kimberley diamond mines in South 
Africa? the Rand gold fields? Here are some words that 
one often finds in reading about South Africa. Which of 
them are familiar to you? Trek, veldt, kraal, kopje, Kaffir, 
Bushmen, Hottentot, calabash, mealies? In North Africa 
these words are heard: Bedouin, sheik, Berber, wadi, mehari, 
oasis, pyramids, sphine. Add two words to each list. What 
desert stories do you recall? history tales of Egypt? What 
have you learned about the Nile River? What do you recall 
as to the African lands controlled by European nations? Do 
you know the three countries of Africa which are indepen- 
dent? Do you know what European nation controls most 
land?

  218 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
Africa furnishes us some articles of everyday use. Most 
of our cloves come from the Zanzibar area. Our ivory comes 
largely from Africa; what uses of ivory do you recall? 
Palm oil seems to be an important item of commerce nowa- 
days; some one says that wherever the oil palm grows in 
quantity, it will pay to put in a railroad. What uses of 
palm oil do you know? What advertisements mention it? 
What else do we get from Africa? , 
‘You have heard of some very interesting native peoples 
of Africa — the Pygmies, perhaps. What others? 
Have you found an impressive description of a tropical 
forest? What have you read about the Congo? (Vachel 
Lindsay’s The Congo grips the imagination.) Some of the 
horrors of Africa have impressed us deeply — the sleeping 
sickness, caused by the tsetse fly; the poisonous snakes and 
insects; the forest solitudes; the desert heat and loneliness; 
the cannibalism, the inter-tribal wars and enslavements, 
the atrocities in the Congo, the dangers from wild animals, 
etc. (It is not wise to stress these points unduly.) Give 
every place-name in Africa you can think of. It will help 
us to get a good start in our study. 
Reading the map. In reading the map of Africa, search 
closely for evidence as to the kinds of climate {to be found 
here. No other map tells the story, of climatic belts quite 
so clearly.

Map facts children suggest. 
1. Africa is nearly all a plateau. It has less plains area 
for its size than any other continent. 
2. Africa has a very straight coast line. It has no great 
peninsulas or inland seas. There are very few islands around  
-P-A-G-E-225
  UNIT 22. AFRICA 219 
it. I wonder if the people are good seamen. (The teacher 
asks if more islands are found associated with irregular 
broken coasts than with straight coasts.) 
3. By the scale of miles, Africa is nearly 5000 miles in 
its longest and its widest distances. 
4, Africa is so close to Europe and Asia that it really is 
a part of them. It seems strange that it was so slow to be 
settled when it is so near these densely populated continents. 
5. Africa has its highest mountains rather close to the 
coast. There are not many mountains as compared with 
Europe, Asia, or the Americas. 
6. There are narrow coastal plains on the north and in 
broken lines on the east and west. The Congo Basin is a 
kind of central plain. It has no extension to the coast. 
7. The equator crosses Africa almost in the middle. 
Africa is also crossed by the two tropics. It is the only 
continent that is crossed by both tropics. 
8. I find three great deserts here: the Sahara, the Libyan, 
and the Kalahari. I am sure that these deserts would make 
it difficult for explorers to get to the interior of the continent. 
9. About two thirds of the continent is in the torrid 
zone. 
10. There is a chain of lakes east of the Congo Basin. 
I wonder if they can be used for transportation, as our Great 
Lakes. They do not seem to be connected so closely. 
11. The Nile is the longest river. It has many tributaries 
in its southern part, but does not have one tributary in its 
lower part. Perhaps that is because it is flowing through the 
desert. 
12. Lake Chad, at the edge of the desert, reminds me of 
Great Salt Lake. 
13. The Congo River has tributaries that twist all around 
in the Congo Basin. I wonder if this river is used much for 
transportation. 
14. There are some short rivers in the northern desert 
that begin and end there. They do not get out to the sea. 
That makes me think of the “‘ withering streams ” we found 
in the Great Basin in our own country. 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  220 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
15. I notice many short rivers around the coasts, except 
where the deserts are. The Limpopo in the southeast makes 
me think of Kipling’s Jungle Book and the “ great gray green 
greasy Limpopo River.” 
16. It seems to me that Africa is a continent that is hard 
to get into to explore. It has no Mississippi-Great Lakes 
system, and no St. Lawrence entrance, unless the Nile could 
be used that way. I think the Nile has too many cataracts 
to be easily navigable. Africa has no seas like the Medi- 
terranean or the Black or the Baltic, to help in inland travel. 
17. I should expect to find a jungle forest along the 
equator. 
18. When I look at the political map, I notice that the 
boundaries are very irregular. There are only a few straight 
lines. I wonder if these boundaries follow surface features. 
19. The rainfall map shows the heaviest rain on the 
west near the Gulf of Guinea, and in Liberia. All the 
Congo Basin has heavy rain. The southeast coast has 
sufficient rain, while the southwest has less than 10 inches. 
All of northern Africa is a desert, except part of Morocco 
and Algeria and the Nile Valley. 
20. The temperature map shows that west central Africa 
is always hot. The eastern coastal lowland is always hot; 
only two small highland areas, one in the north and one 
in the far south of the continent, have cold winters. Where 
the three desert areas are, they have very hot summers and 
mild winters. In Abyssinia, it is marked “ always mild.” 
21. The population map is very spotty. Egypt, Nigeria, 
Abyssinia, Morocco, and Algeria seem to be the more 
crowded areas. The three deserts are, of course, almost 
empty areas. 
22. The French have their African land in the north- 
west; Britain has much land in the south and east, besides 
Nigeria and the Egyptian Sudan; Belgium has the Congo 
Basin; Portugal has three areas, two in the south and one 
on the west coast north of the equator; Italy has three areas, 
widely scattered; Spain has a very small coastal strip south 
of Morocco. Egypt, Abyssinia, and Liberia are independent.
-P-A-G-E-227
  UNIT 22. AFRICA’ 221 
23. The Sudan is a grass land. I wonder if it is something 
like our prairies. 
24. There are many small political divisions around the 
Gulf of Guinea. I wonder why. 
25. The railroad map shows no transcontinental lines. 
The Union of South Africa has more railroad lines than any 
other part of the continent. Egypt has a line along the Nile. 
Other African lines are short spurs running in from the coast. 
There is no long line along the coast. 
26. The economic map shows that cattle are found in 
many places; more frequently south of the equator. Palm 
nuts are found mainly along the west coast, in places not 
too far from the equator, and in the Congo Basin. More 
minerals are found in the southern part than anywhere else. 
27. The arrangement of climatic belts in Africa interests 
me. The northern belts seem to duplicate the southern. 
Light rain 
Desert 
Grass land 
Equatorial forest 
Equatorial forest 
Grass land 
Desert 
Light rain 
The belts do not run exactly parallel, because highlands 
interfere. Dry belts widen toward the west. That reminds 
me that the trade winds are from the east. Lowlands in 
equatorial areas are rainy, whether they are near the sea or 
not. 
28. With so many plateaus, I think railroading in Arice, 
would be difficult and expensive. 
29. The Congo Basin spreads out wide over the equator, 
in the middle of the continent. 
Interest centers. 
1. I should like to find out about the interesting native 
peoples: Pygmies, Hottentots, Bushmen, Kaffirs, Bedouins, 
Bantus, Sudanese, and others.
-P-A-G-E-228

2. The trade of Africa interests me. I should like to 
find out what they export and import, and something about 
their lines of ocean travel and their seaports. 
3. I should like to know more about the animals of 
Africa, and why they are found there. 
4. I have read something about the Cape-to-Cairo rail- 
way, and should like to know more about it. 
5. Why are there only three independent countries in 
Africa? 
6. Is it a good thing for a nation in the temperate zone 
to have control of tropical lands? 
7. I should like to know more about life in the African 
desert. 
8. I should like to find out all I can about the Congo 
Basin. 
9. How do the different European countries manage 
their African dependencies? Which one is most successful? 
10. Which European country got the best African 
territory? 
11. Why is Egypt independent? 
12. How does it happen that Abyssinia has been able to 
keep her independence? 
13. I should like to find out how that negro a of 
Liberia gets along. 
14. I have seen so many advertisements about athe oil 
that I should like to know more about it. 
15. I should like to know more about the diamond mines. 
16. Is Madagascar a good possession for the French to 
have? 
17. I should like to find out about the white ant and the 
tsetse fly. 
18. I am interested in finding out about the wonders of 
Egypt: the Pyramids, the Sphinx, the ancient temples, etc. 
19. I will look up the life of Cecil Rhodes. 
20. I should like to learn all I can about the jungle forest 
(the equatorial rain forest). 
21. Why is there usually such heavy rain along the 
equator?
-P-A-G-E-229

22. What areas in Africa are white man’s land — where 
white people can live comfortably? 
23. I will find out all I can about the Nile River. 
24, I have read that the Victoria Falls of the Zambezi 
are greater than Niagara. I want to find out more about 
them. 
The selection of interest centers for general class work 
will probably depend largely on the treatment of Africa 
found in your principal textbook. Textbook writers differ 
in their method of analysis. The Atwood text discusses 
natural regions (physiographic areas); then divides the 
continent into units based on ownership. Brigham and 
McFarlane take up each country separately. McMurry and 
Parkins use political affiliation as a basis for division. 
Smith discusses climatic regions. All are helpful, and their 
diversity of treatment makes them rich in suggestion for the 
teacher who is fortunate enough to possess them all. 
Since the personal situation involved in ownership and 
control of lands has a special appeal to junior high school 
students, the interest center selected for outlining here has 
to do with that phase of African geography. Here is a 
great continent largely divided into shares which European 
nations hold and rule. How does it happen that this was 
permitted? Does it prove profitable to the controlling 
nations to keep these lands? Which nation got the best 
share? Is it a good thing for the African areas to be ruled 
by outsiders? Which share is cared for best? Such are 
some of the queries which come naturally to students of 
this age. They see the continent as a grab bag. Who 
grabbed the best share? What are some of the difficulties 
in keeping these shares? Which parts have the most inde- 
pendence?

Begin the investigation by a careful reading of the map of 
this country. You will assume that the area has some ad- 
vantages over the rest of the continent, or it would be sub- 
ject territory. What do you notice as to opportunities for 
protection? Could it be easily invaded? Most lands so 
near the equator would not have an energizing climate. 
Look up rainfall and temperature maps. What helps to 
overcome the effect of low latitude here? Describe the high- 
lands of Abyssinia as to extent, altitude, mineralization, 
forests, etc. (See encyclopedias.) What kind of people 
are found here? (The most vigorous natives of Africa.)

they compare in area? How do you account for the greater 
density here? In what points does the Union of South 
Africa surpass any other part of the continent?

LANDS RULED BY THE FRENCH 
Why is it advantageous to France to control Tunisia,

winter-rainfall type of climate? How do the highlands 
(the Atlas Mountains) affect the temperature and rainfall 
here? Notice temperature and rainfall maps. What rainfall 
do you find back of the Atlas Mountains? Why are goats

LANDS RULED BY BELGIUM 
(See Saturday Evening Post, February 12, 1921.) 
The Belgian Congo. This is a land of adventure and 
hardship, often called the last frontier of civilization. If 
you were going to travel in the Congo Basin, what equip- 
ment would you need to take? Why must you pack all 
clothing, etc., in metal boxes? How far could you travel 
up the Congo from the coast, until you would transfer to 
the railway train from your boat? Why is the transfer 
necessary? Where could you change back to river travel? 
What fuel is used on these river boats? What meats, fruits, 
vegetables would you have to eat? Would the jungle forest 
continually line the river banks? What big-game animals 
might you see? What type of negro tribes are found in this 
forest land? How do they differ from the Sudanese? Kaf- 
firs? Hottentots? Can you think of one reason why Pygmies 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  UNIT 22. AFRICA 229 
are found only in the equatorial forest? How far up the 
Congo can you travel by boat? What freight would you 
expect to see along the banks, awaiting shipment by boat? 
The oil palm is the staff of life in the Congo. Mention five 
uses the natives make of the tree and its nuts. Why is big 
business scouring the ends of the world to find oil-palm 
trees in quantity? For what reason is the palm-oil industry 
more dependable than the wild rubber industry? What 
railroad lines do you find mapped in the Congo Basin? 
Does the oil-palm business, as the natives handle it, call for 
expensive machinery? What cotton areas do you locate 
here? Of course this will call for cotton gins. Where would 
the machinery probably come from? If you travel in the 
Congo, what special precautions must you take for your 
health? Why? What is your protection from the glaring 
sun? Do you expect to find that the natives are very ener- 
getic and have a will to work? Why is it not necessary for 
them to work as hard as we do in our latitudes? How long 
are the days at the equator? Is this an advantage? As you 
read and think about these people who have not been born 
in highly progressive lands, you realize something of what 
Kipling meant by the “ white man’s burden.” What are 
some ways for white people to help these natives along the 
road to civilization? Often the first touch of civilization is 
harmful rather than helpful. Why? 
- What is the food of the natives? Bread made from roots 
seems strange to us. How is it prepared? Why are so many 
chickens raised by the natives? What is grown in their 
little garden patches? Where in the Congo is the cattle 
area? The mineral area, the Katanga district, is famous for 
its copper. Trace on the map the railroad from Katanga 
across Angola. To what seaport? Why are the products of 
the jungle forest usually discovered and used before the 
mines are developed? Are beasts of burden common here? 
Can you describe a true equatorial forest — the variety in 
the species; the trunks, leaves, and canopy of the trees; the 
forest floor, where the shade-loving plants are found; 
the vines and runners? Why are the big-game animals not  
-P-A-G-E-236
230 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
found in the dense forest? Where else in the world would 
you find equatorial forests? 
The worst enemies of the Congo are the mosquito, the 
tsetse fly, and the white ant. Why? What others do you 
add to the list? Why is the plantain (a kind of banana) so 
valuable? If you were planning to invest capital in the 
Belgian Congo, what enterprises would interest you most? 
Debate: Resolved, That the oil palm is of more eco- 
_ homic value than the coconut palm. 
LANDS RULED BY ITALY 
  Consult the encyclopedias, the gazetteer, and other ref- 
erence materials to discover the chief values and interests 
in Libya, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland. Be sure to get 
from the maps all the facts and inferences that you can find. 
Such questions as these may arise: Is the position of Soma- 
liland on the African “ horn” an especially favorable one? 
In how far do desert conditions hinder Eritrea and Libya? 
Ancient Rome was unusually successful in colonization. Is 
modern Italy also successful? Do these African possessions 
give Italy a place to which she may send her surplus popula- 
tion as colonizers? Do they furnish Italy with needed raw 
materials for manufacture, with food, or with fuel? 
Much the same type of questions will arise for brief study 
of the African lands ruled by Portugal and Spain.

UNIT 23. AUSTRALIA 
Time required: 2 weeks 
Finding the starting point. What Australia furnishes to 
us: wool, meat, hides and skins, rabbit fur for felt hats, 
copper, ete. Interesting facts we have heard about Aus- 
tralia and New Zealand, such as boomerang throwing; 
how kangaroos are different from animals of other continents; 
what we have heard about Maoris (native New Zealanders) ; 
where rabbits are a plague; the great sheep ranches (called 
“vuns”’); the geysers of New Zealand; etc. Consult the 
unit study of the British Isles and learn what Australia and 
New Zealand send to the home land. What have you heard 
about the bravery of the “‘ Anzacs”’ (Australians and New 
Zealanders) in the World War? Have you read history 
stories about Captain Cook and the discovery of Australia? 
Reading the map. On the globe and the world map, 
Australia seems to be set off by itself. Judging by the scale 
of miles, it is about 6000 miles from Australia to California; 
about 14,000 miles to England; about 6000 miles to South 
Africa; over 4000 miles to the Hawaiian Islands; over 1000 
miles to New Zealand. The near neighbors, the East 
Indies, would not be very helpful to Australia, I think. In 
shape, Australia looks a little like a ragged shell. (The 
teacher may suggest that one writer calls it an empty shell, 
so far as population is concerned.) Its coast line is not 
very irregular; the Gulf of Carpentaria is shaped something 
like the Gulf of Tarento in Italy. There are a few lakes in 
the southern part of the island. Nearly all the rivers are in 
the eastern half; I wonder if that is where the heaviest 
rainfall is. The pattern of the surface features makes me 
think of our own country; there is an eastern highland 
rather close to the coast; then comes a belt of plains, with 
an irregular plateau to the west; beyond that is a coastal 
plain. Australia has no wide mountain belt like our Rockies. 
The coastal plains around the Great Australian Bight 
remind me of our gulf plains. When I look at the popula- 
tion map, I see that nearly all the people live in the southeast 
part. The western plateau is almost empty. The Tropic of 
232 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  UNIT 23. AUSTRALIA’ 233 
Capricorn runs through the island; that tells me that all 
the country north of that line is in the torrid zone; I shall 
not expect that part to be a good home for white men. The 
30th parallel also runs through Australia; that locates 
roughly the boundary line between the southeast trades and 
the westerly winds. I wonder if the big continent of Asia 
affects the world winds here, and so causes monsoons. By 
the rainfall map I see that more than one third of the whole 
continent has less than 10 inches of rain. Does any other 
continent have as much desert for its size? The highest 
rainfall is on the eastern and northern coasts and in Tas- 
mania; there is also a corner in southwest Australia where 
there is sufficient rain. New Zealand has its heaviest rain 
on the west; I think that is because it is in the path of the 
westerlies. Australia is divided into six states; Victoria 
and New South Wales have over half of all the population. 
Discovering some interest centers. I should like to find 
out more about the big sheep ranches. It would be inter- 
esting to find out why most of the people live in the southeast 
part. Ive heard about the mining town of Coolgardie, and 
how the water they use is piped all the way from Perth; I 
should like to find out more about that. The queer plants 
and animals interest me. Since the British Isles are so over- 
crowded, I wonder why more people do not move to Aus- 
tralia. What would it be like to live in tropical Australia? 
Could Australia support a much larger population? I should 
like to visit Melbourne to see what it is like. Why is 
New Zealand rated so high? Could New Zealand support 
a larger population? How do most people make a living 
there? Is much manufacturing done in Australia? I should 
like to compare Australia and Canada, to see which is the 
more hopeful country. 
Working out some of the problems. We found over- 
crowded lands in Europe and Asia; in Japan especially, we 
found far too many people for the area and the possible food 
production. Australia, on the other hand, is an empty land; 
it could easily support ten times as many people as it now 
has; it needs immigrants to work its unused fields. The  
-P-A-G-E-240
  234 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
people who live there, however, have decided that they will 
not allow any colored people to settle in the continent, as 
they wish to keep it a white man’s land. Are they justified in 
excluding the Japanese, Chinese, Indians, Malays, and others? 
x Problem. Should Australia be kept as a white man’s land? 
‘1, The present population. What is the present popula- 
tion? Where did the people come from originally? What

Australians — their characteristics, their interest in the rest 
of the world, their health, etc. What do most of them do 
fora living? From the Statesman’s Y ear-Book, encyclopedias, 
and other works of reference, find out what is their wealth per 
capita; what per cent own any land; about what is the pres- 
ent rate of immigration. Australia is self-governing; how 
is the parliament made up? Who of its citizens can vote? 
2. Can Australia take care of more people? It is claimed 
that Australia could provide homes and employment for 
fifty million people, instead of the present five millions. 
What is the density of population per square mile? Compare 
with that of Canada, the United States, Argentina. What 
part of the continent is a plain and so has a surface suitable 
for farming? It is estimated that at least 16 per cent of the 
area could be cultivated. Less than 1 per cent of the entire 
area is now cultivated. Can you find some reasons for this?! 
Sometimes such a condition is due to a labor shortage; 
sometimes to the fact that much of the land is held in large 
estates; sometimes to poor transportation facilities. Are 
these true in Australia? 
From the rainfall map determine what part of the conti- 
nent has sufficient rainfall for crops. Consult your textbooks 
to find how uncertain the rain is over much of the continent, 
and some effects of this variability. What reasons can you 
give for the dry interior of the continent? for the summer 
rains of the northeast coast? for the winter rains of the 
southwest coast? Consider the possibilities of irrigation; on 
the map, determine some areas that seem hopeless; others,
-P-A-G-E-241
  
UNIT 23. AUSTRALIA 235 
that could be reached by water from rivers. Read about the 
artesian wells which have been dug in many places. Recall 
that Australia is about the size of the United States. Has 
it as much land under cultivation? Has it as many farmers? 
What per cent of the present population is farming? 
The following figure facts help us to see what materials 
for food are produced annually in Australia: wheat, 145 
million bushels; oats, 18 million; barley, 7 million; corn, 
7 million; sugar cane, 14 million tons. Besides these products 
there is a heavy yield of potatoes, fruits, grapes, etc. 
Summarize your conclusions as to the possibility of devel- 
oping more farming land and producing more food. 
Australia ranks first in the world in number of sheep and 
amount of wool produced. In an average year the continent 
will have about 80 million sheep, 12 million cattle, and about 
1 million hogs. Read in your textbooks about the famous 
merino breed of wool sheep. Describe a great sheep ranch. 
Tell how the sheep are cared for; the grasses they graze (the 
saltbush); how rabbits are enemies to the sheep; etc. 
Locate on the map the most important sheep areas. Are all 
available sheep-grazing lands now used? Why is transpor- 
tation not so important a factor in the wool-sheep industry? 
Why are there so many mutton sheep in Australia? How 
is the meat sent to other countries? Where is the beef- © 
cattle area? Are there many dairy cows in Australia? 
Where is the butter sent? Why are there so many more 
sheep than hogs here? Reach conclusions as to whether 
Australia could produce more meat. Does the world demand 
more meat? Would increased live-stock production give 
employment to many more workmen? Why? . 
What can be grown in tropical Australia? Is there much 
demand in the outside world for cane sugar, rubber, coffee, 
cotton, tropical fruits? What parts of tropical Australia 
are too dry for such crops? Are there workmen for such 
plantations? (Judge by your population map.) Could white 
men do the work on the plantations? What overcrowded 
farmers of Asia might succeed here, if they were allowed to 
come? What per cent of tropical Australia is now cultivated? 
Could it support a larger population?  
-P-A-G-E-242
  236 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
The forests of Australia are very valuable. Describe the 
eucalyptus tree, and find from an encyclopedia some of its 
many uses. To what countries is Australian lumber sent? 
Are all the forest areas being used? Would this industry 
take care of many additional workmen? 
Would the mining business provide work for more people? 
Locate the gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, iron, and coal 
areas. Are the coal fields well located? About what is the 
yearly coal output? Why is coal exported from Australia to 
distant lands? Is the home demand for coal very great? 
(Judge by the development of manufacturing, and by the 
fuel requirement of warm lands.) What seems to be a 
disadvantage in the location of the gold fields? Read about 
the Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie mines, and tell some of the 
difficulties of mining in the desert. Does it remind you of 
the nitrate desert in Chile? How are camels used in the 
Australian gold fields? Are all the known mineral areas now 
being worked? Is there need of more workmen? 
Look at a railroad map, and tell about what areas are best 
provided with railways. Compare with the population map. 
Trace the one transcontinental line from east to west across 
the country. Can you find some reasons for the choice of 
route? Read about state ownership of railways in Australia. 
What parts of the country have no railroads? Are those 
parts well represented in Parliament? Then would Parlia- 
ment be eager to build railroads in such states? What might 
make it profitable to build more miles of railroad? In our 
own Mid-West and Far West, did the larger immigration 
come before, or after, the railroads were built? Why are not 
Australian rivers used more for transportation? Find out, 
if you can, what steamship companies have a regular line of 
boats to Australia. Do most boats have a cargo both going 
and coming? Judging by all the available transportation 
facilities, is Australia easily accessible to settlers? What is 
needed? 
Consult your textbooks to find what goods are manu- 
factured here; then think over the additional manufactures 
which Australia could develop, judging by the raw material,
-P-A-G-E-243
UNIT 23. AUSTRALIA 237 
the coal supply, the labor supply, and the home demand. 
The following manufactures from the United States are in 
cviuand: cloth and wearing apparel, paints and varnishes, 
iron and steel, wire fence, farm machinery, electrical appli- 
ances, mining machinery, boots and shoes, furniture and 
lumber, paper, automobiles, etc. How many of these could 
be made at home? Is it better for Australia to devote herself 
to producing raw materials, or is she ready to develop more 
manufactures? 
3. Why is Australia reserved for the people of the white 
race? We have found that Australians are largely descend- 
ants of British people, and that they are intelligent, ener- 
getic, and ambitious. They are very few in number, how- 
ever, and immigration is not increasing the population very 
fast. Much of the continent is still unsettled, and a large 
area has not even been explored. The tropical lowland has a 
climate unhealthful for white people; yet it has fertile soils 
and abundant rainfall, so that it could produce some field 
crops and tree crops which the world needs. If the colored 
races were allowed to settle here, what peoples would come 
from Asia? from the neighboring-islands? If they out- 
numbered the white people, how would they affect the 
present standards of living? the present form of government? 
the schools? social customs? Could they be “ Australian- 
ized ” quickly enough to keep the morals and manners of the 
country at their present level? How do Californians feel 
toward Japanese immigration? Does Canada _ permit 
Asiatics to settle in her big empty country? How about 
South Africa and the people of India? What is the attitude 
of the United States toward immigration? Why have we 
restricted it in the last few years? Why is Brazil more 
liberal to people of the colored races? From the point of 
view of the overcrowded peoples of Asia, who have no 
opportunity to advance, if they do not emigrate, is it fair to 
keep a rich continent like Australia in reserve for one race? 
From the point of view of Australians, would it be wise to 
turn their home land over to Japanese, Chinese, Kanakas, 
etc.? Might it not be a good thing for future generations if 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  238 UNIT STUDIES IN GEOGRAPHY 
some great resources of soils, minerals, water power, etc., 
were held in reserve for a time? a 
You see that there are two sides to this question. Perhaps 
you would like to debate the subject. Divide the whole 
class into two parts, and have an informal debate. (This 
problem of overcrowded peoples and empty lands is one of 
the most serious questions the world has to face. How 
would you settle it? 
Suggestions for children’s activities. Imagine that you 
are an Australian visiting in Europe. You are telling about 
your country and are trying to persuade a group of people to 
come to Australia to live. You are selling farm machinery 
in Australia. You are a representative of a great American 
wool-buying company, negotiating for wool in Melbourne. 
Tell your classmates that you are going to explain to them 
how parts of Australia resemble parts of the United States. 
Find a California, a Florida, a Kansas, a Washington, etc. 
Make a good talk to your class, telling why New Zealand 
is 3B, good place in which to live.

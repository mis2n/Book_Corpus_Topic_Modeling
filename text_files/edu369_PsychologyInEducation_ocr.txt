PREFACE. 
PsycHOLoGy is the science of mind, — mind in what- 
ever manifested. Its applications are numerous, — in 
biology, sociology, criminology, education, — and each 
application is rapidly becoming a specialty. i 
It is with psychology in education that this book is 
concerned. But although it is intended mainly and 
primarily for teachers, it is hoped that others whose 
business it is to educate the human mind, and to in- 
fluence its growth, may find something herein that will 
serve them also. If the book aids in quickening an 
interest in mind study as applied to education, in the 
narrower or in the broader sense, its chief purpose will 
be accomplished.

CHAPTER IL 
INTRODUCTION. 
Tuts book is written for the average teacher, and be- 
cause of the deep interest that the average teacher — 
the private in the grand army of education — is taking 
in the subject. 
In its method of presentation it combines such prac- 
tical experience as the author has gained from many 
years’ teaching of teachers, with the knowledge of their 
needs which abundant opportunities for observation of 
these have given. Almost every paragraph was written 
with the thought constantly in mind, “ What applica- 
tion can be made of this in the details of everyday 
school work?” 
Psychology sustains the same relation to the science 
of education that anatomy, physiology, and pharmacy 
sustain to the practice of medicine. It is as : 
necessary that the teacher should know some- oe 
thing of the mind’s activities as it is that the te a 
physician should know the bodily organs 
and their functions, their normal and their abnormal 
conditions. 
The teacher should be able to tell why he teaches 
arithmetic or history, and why he teaches them in a 
certain way, as the physician should be able to tell why 
he prescribes dieting and exercise for certain ailments, 
and this or that drug for other diseases. - Just as the 
7
-P-A-G-E-8
8 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
physician should know the specific effect of any medi- 
cine upon the organs of the body, so the teacher should 
know the effect of a given school exercise or branch of 
study on the different faculties of the mind. 
It seems self-evident that no real science of educa- 
tion is possible, except as it is founded on psychology, 
and that the work of the individual teacher, from the 
kindergarten to the university, will be valuable in pro- 
portion as it is directed by some intelligent compre- 
hension of the activities of the mind and the laws 
of its growth. 
Poikta to Attention is asked- to certain character- 
be noted. istics in the treatment of the subject, as 
herein offered. 
1. The full and logical outline, by which the reader 
may guide his study of this and other similar books, 
and which presents in compact, connected form the 
several topics to be discussed. 
2. The care with which all terms technical to the 
subject-matter are defined. 
3. The sharp distinction drawn between the faculties 
of the mind, and the operations which they, singly or in 
groups, perform. 
4. The constant emphasis laid throughout upon the 
necessity and the means of carrying psychology into 
the daily work of the school. 
5. The avoidance of speculative metaphysics, beyond 
a few suggestions which may serve, perhaps, to stimu- 
late those who desire to do so to pursue the study in 
other than its educational relations. 
Technicalities have not been multiplied. The terms 
used are in the main those in accepted use by other 
writers on mental phenomena. When new terms are

introduced, or old ones used with changed meaning, 
careful definitions are given, so there should be no occa- 
sion for confusion. There is no room for dog- 
matism in psychology; and, though some of 
the definitions may appear dogmatic and final, they are 
merely intended to present concisely the writer’s views 
of present knowledge, and to afford some assistance in Terms used. 
constructing a psychological terminology. The writer 
does not believe that difficult language is in any degree 
necessary in a psychological discussion. 
Although it is remembered that the mind is a uzzt, and 
has no divisions, yet the term faculties is used, because 
there is no better term by which to express the fact 
that the mind manifests its activity in different ways. 
Dr. Laurie says, in his “Institutes of Education,” “It 
seems to me quite unnecessary to abandon the use of so 
useful a word.” Dr. Ladd indorses the term by using 
it, and so also does Dr. Van Norden. I am content 
to be in such excellent company, and shall use faculties 
as it has always been used, to name collectively | the 
different phases of the mind’s activity. 
Man gained his first knowledge of the material world 
through observation of it. So, when man first began 
to study himself, he turned the mind in upon ethods of 
itself, and observed its phenomena. This Study. 
observation of self by self is called zxtrospection. There 
are also the observational and comparative, the labora- 
tory, and the classroom methods of studying mental 
phenomena. 
Introspection is a valid and valuable method of in- 
vestigation, for the mind presents phenomena  tntrospec- 
which the mind can as truly observe as it tion. 
can observe the changes going on in the material world.
-P-A-G-E-10
10 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
The mind can watch itself reasoning, or enjoying, or 
desiring, as well as it can watch a laboratory experi- 
ment or an eclipse of the moon. Its interpretations of 
what it observes are just as trustworthy in the one case 
as in the other, and the mental phenomena are almost 
as classifiable as the material phenomena. 
The habit of introspection — of observing one’s own 
mental states and acts—is hard to form, and requires 
effort and practice. The same may be said, however, 
of the habit of correct observation of any class of phe- 
nomena. But, once formed, the habit becomes one 
of the safest and most helpful guides in the study of 
psychology. 
As a corrective to the personal bias that inheres in 
the introspective method, and as a positive aid in col- 
observa. lecting data and noting points of view that 
tional one’s own mind cannot furnish, the observa- 
Method. tinal (or comparative) method is excellent. 
Since we are all the time surrounded by our fellow- 
minds, this method is as easy to use as the introspective.. 
Study people’s beliefs, habits, conduct, and character. 
Observe their environment, their methods of reasoning 
about common matters, and the causes of their acts. 
Compare their apparent standpoint with your own, and 
try to put yourself at their point of view. In this way 
one’s knowledge of practical psychology is greatly in- 
creased, and a habit is formed of more liberal and gen- 
erous treatment of those from whom one must differ. 
But the comparative method has a much wider appli- 
Cogan: cation than what has just been said about 
tive it would indicate. Our knowledge of anat- 
ees omy and biology, of language and art, has 
been greatly and rapidly increased and liberalized by 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
- INTRODUCTION. Il 
the comparative method of study, — putting two or 
more anatomical structures, or plants, or languages, 
under observation at once, and noting their likenesses 
and differences. So in the study of mind much has 
been gained, and vastly more is to be gained, for the 
science of psychology, by comparing the methods of 
thought and the motives of action of one people or 
race with those of another; and the psychologist of 
to-day does not consider it beneath him to make a 
careful comparative study of mind in the lower animals. 
The teacher can follow this example with much interest 
and profit. 
It.is only within the past few years that the Libcttbs 
method of studying mind has come into use. There 
is a considerable and increasing number of Laboratory 
well-equipped psychological laboratories in Method. 
the United States. The laboratory method is con- 
cerned mostly with physiological psychology, which is, 
after all, only physiology, even though it be the physi- 
ology of the nervous system and the special organs of 
sense, —the material tools of the mind. And after 
physiological psychology has had its rather prolix say, 
causal connection of the physical organs with psychic 
action is as obscure and impossible of explanation as 
ever. Dr. Laurie very aptly says, “ After all, psycho- 
physics can never be more than physics.” But the 
laboratory method can be of excellent service in de- 
termining the material conditions of mental action, in 
detecting special deficiencies and weaknesses, and in 
accumulating valuable statistics along these lines. 
It has been asserted that no science can claim to be 
exact until it can be reduced ‘to formulas of weights 
and measures. The assertion begs the question for the
-P-A-G-E-12
  
  {2 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
materialists. We shall probably never be able to weigh 
* an idea or measure the cubic contents of the memory; 
but the rapidity with which ideas are formed or repro- 
duced by memory has been measured in many par- 
ticular instances, and the circumstances that retard or 
accelerate their formation or reproduction have been 
positively ascertained and classified. This kind of 
work has but begun. What it will bring forth that the 
teacher can use, remains to be seen. 
Good teachers through all time have used what I 
have called the classroom method; but only in recent 
Classroom years hasit been systematized, experimentally 
Method. directed, and its results put upon record. It 
consists in experimental observations made upon the 
pupils of any grade, in their daily work in the classroom. 
To secure results that have value, the pupils should not 
be made aware of what is being done, or, at least, of 
the purpose of it. 
These experimental observations may be made by 
any patient and observing teacher, upon such matters 
as the aptitude of pupils for certain studies; the com- 
parative aptitudes of boys and girls, or of pupils of 
different social surroundings, for the same study ; how 
pupils study, and why they study that way ; the readi- 
ness with which different classes of facts are assimilated 
and remembered; the variation of mental power at 
different ages; the moral ideas of the pupils, —their 
notions of duty and of right and wrong. Much has 
been done along these lines of late, and the results of 
such observations and experiments have been set forth 
in various educational publications.’

articles as these: ‘‘ Tests on Memory and Senses of Children,” Edu-

  INTRODUCTION. ; 13 
This last method of studying mind, and collecting | 
data to help in the formation of a psychology that 
may be applied in education, is usable by any teacher. 
The best psychological laboratory is the schoolroom, 
and the teacher is rich in opportunity. 
Touse it intelligently, and to direct his investigations 
so that they shall serve the highest interests of his 
calling, the teacher must know what education is. And 
fundamental to every useful application of his data, 
when he has collected them, must be a clear and ade- 
quate concept of teaching. 
Right education is such a preparation of the individual, 
in physical, intellectual, and moral capacities, as will 
enable him to secure the highest enjoyment from 5 s.cation 
their use, here and hereafter. This defini- and Teaching 
tion will hold for education as process and “*#"** 
as product. The definition is not a selfish one, making 
education out to be a benefit to the one only who has 
it; for the “highest ” enjoyment is found in the full, 
normal use of all the faculties of the body and mind 
in such way that others may be benefited also. Selfish 
enjoyment is not the highest enjoyment. 
Teaching is consciously doing three things, —instruct- 
ing, developing, training. Education is the broader 
term, and may, in its unlimited sense, be taken to 
mean the sum of all the influences, direct or indirect, 
that make the individual what he is. A distinction 
may properly be made between education in its un- 
limited sense, and formal education. The five great 
engines of formal education are (1) the home, (2) the 
school, (3) the press, (4) the pulpit, (5) the platform.

cates,” Popular Science Monthly, November 1892; ‘‘Child Study,” 
Forum, February, 1894. (

Teaching is more restricted in its meaning, and 
implies that an intelligent agent is selecting, directing, 
modifying, and combining right influences to produce 
a desired effect. 
A man is educated by all the influences of his life. 
He may ¢each himself by putting himself under the 
influence of those surroundings and associations that 
will tend to make him what he wants to become. 
Instructing is directly giving information — knowl- 
edge of facts, new ideas, and words—to the pupil. 
Instructing This is the least part of the work of the 
defined. teacher, and should be done only for the 
purpose of stimulating the desire for more knowledge, 
and of furnishing material that the pupil cannot eco- 
nomically get for himself. The teacher should not 
give information which the pupil, without too much 
waste of time, can secure by his own efforts. 
The result of right instruction is useful knowledge. 
Developing is increasing, through use, the natural 
power of an organ or faculty; bringing out latent 
Developing energies and capacities. We may develop — 
defined. increase the strength of—a muscle, mem- 
ory, conscience, will. The result of development is 
power.

and carefully directed practice, to function rapidly and

To emphasize and illustrate the central idea of these 
definitions, some others are quoted : —

control, to develop the natural powers of the child, so

happy, and morally worthy life.”— Sully. 
“Education [teaching] is essentially the action of 
other human beings on the child, and this only so far 
as it is conscious and designed.”’"— Swily. 
“Teaching is simply helping the mind to perform 
its function of knowing and growing.”— Laurie. 
“Teaching is the process by which one mind, from 
set purpose, produces the life-unfolding process in 
another.” — Tompkins. 
The teacher is recommended to read the whole of 
Herbert Spencer’s unequaled essay on education.

THE PHYSICAL BASIS. 21 
CHAPTER III. 
THE PHYSICAL BASIS. 
Tr is not at all necessary to the purpose of an educa- 
tional psychology that a minute discussion of nerve 
physiology be entered into. Only a brief summary of 
what is known regarding the physical basis of mind will 
be given here, therefore. All that is known regarding 
‘the subject may be stated fully in one paragraph: 
Mind as we know it rests upon a physical basis, which 
acts upon mind, and upon which mind acts. What the 
connection is between mind and that physical basis, or 
how this connection is made and maintained, is not 
known, and most probably never will be known. 
Any text-book on the physiology of the sensitive 
system describes with more or less fullness the form, 
structure, and functions of the organs that constitute 
the physical basis of mind. But the hard pismiaes 
fact remains,—a fact which the “newschool” isnot “ 
of psychologists seems to forget or not to per- PS¥°Ro!EY- 
ceive,— that the physiology of the nervous system is 
not iz any sense psychology. Undoubtedly, a knowl- 
edge of physiology materially aids the student of psy- 
chology, but so does a knowledge of chemistry and 
physics. Yet the materialistic school of psychologists 
would doubtless be the first to smile at a “chemical 
psychology.” Intheconcise words of Benedict, “ Physi- 
ology will never front the inner side of a single sensa-  
-P-A-G-E-22
22 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
tion.” Physiology cannot pass beyond nerve tissue 
and its physical phenomena, and it must be content to 
tell us what it can about these. 
Whatever mind is, we know it in ourselves and in 
others only in connection with nerve matter. Some 
Minain ‘iNvestigators have gone so far as to say that 
Nerve wherever there is living gray nerve matter 
Matter. there is mind, whether in animal.or plant. 
It is easier to prove the statement true than to show 
that it is false. Whether it is true or not that mind is 
always associated with living gray nerve matter, it is 
true that it is not associated with anything else, so far 
as we now know. 
Nerve tissue has the peculiar property of irritability, 
by which may be understood the readiness with which 
Functions it receives and transmits molecular. disturb- 
of Nerve ance from one point to another. For ex- | 
Tissue. ample, the finger is pricked witha needle: 
the point disturbs the molecules in the finger end of 
the nerve, and this disturbance is transmitted rapidly 
to the brain. 
Nerve tissue is of two kinds,— gray or cellular, and 
white or fibrous. The functions of the gray matter 
seem to be to receive, to generate, and to transmit, 
nerve disturbance: the sole function of the fibrous 
matter seems to be to ¢ransmit nerve disturbance. 
The general arrangement of nerve tissue in the body 
- is in the plan of various organs situated at the surface 
of the body; nerve fibers running from these directly 
to the brain, or to smaller masses of cellular nerve 
matter at different points in the body; and other nerve 
fibers running from the brain or the smaller masses to 
muscles and to glandular organs. The nerves carrying
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE PHYSICAL BASIS. 23 
impulses inward are called afferent or sensory ; ‘those 
carrying impulses outward are called efferent or motor: 
The business of the outer sense organs is to receive 
impressions from material objects; of the muscles, to 
function in accordance with impulses carried to them; 
of the nerves, to transmit impressions to the central or- 
gans; and of the central organs, to receive these im. 
pulses, and to send out others, due to them or to mental 
acts, to the muscles controlling the motions of the body 
or tothe nerve terminals controlling glandular secretions. 
In addition to this arrangement of the nerve masses, 
called the cerebro-spinal system, there is another, called 
the sympathetic system, whose business it isto Nerve 
regulate and direct the work of such organs Systems. 
as the lungs, heart, liver, etc., of whose normal action 
we are not conscious. Further description of the sym- 
pathetic system is not relevant here. 
The outer organs from which nerves run inward to 
the central nerve masses are called organs of special 
sense. The central masses are the brain, SPt- 91. cere. 
nal cord, and ganglia. The organs of special bro-spinal 
sense are the’ skin and muscles, the eye, the S¥*™ * 
ear, the nose, the tongue. Through the skin we receive 
the sensations of touch and temperature; through the 
muscles, the sensations of motion and resistance ; 
through the eye, the sensation of sight; through the 
ear, sound; through the tongue, taste. 
The essential portion of each special organ of sense, 
as just defined, is composed of nerve tissue; the other 
parts are appendages which aid in the reception of 
impressions. The eye has.but a small quantity of nerve 
matter,— the retina; the skin is full of little nerve buds 
that are the real organs of touch; and so on.
-P-A-G-E-24
24 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
The whole body, with its specialized end organs, is 
called the sensorium. The small masses of nerve matter 
in various parts of the body, to which and from which 
some of the nerves run, are called ganglia (singular, 
ganglion). The spinal cord is the marrow of the back- 
bone, and connects with the brain at the base of the 
skull. The brain is the chief central organ, both in size 
and importance. 
The cerebro-spinal system is sometimes compared to 
a telegraphic system, of which the brain is the great 
central office; the spinal cord and ganglia, Nervous Sys- i temlikea less important central offices; the nerves, the 
Pages connecting lines; the special sense organs, 
the points from which messages are sent in; 
and the muscles, the individuals to whom messages are 
sent. The similarity may be illustrated by tracing a 
sensation and its results. If you touch a hot stove, the 
little nerve buds in your finger are excited; the affer- 
ent nerves carry the news of the accident to the brain, 
which sends out along the efferent nerves a, sharp 
command to the muscles of the arm to contract, and 
withdraw the finger. . 
Much of the work of the muscles is done on com- 
mands sent out from some lower center than the byain. 
The spinal cord directs much of our muscular action 
without troubling the brain about it. After we once 
learn how, we walk, form letters and figures, and per- 
form most of our ordinary muscular functions, without 
giving them any direct voluntary thought. The brain 
leaves, so to speak, such routine, mechanical matters to 
the lower nerve centers. 
Actions which are performed as the result of some 
impression upon the nerve center, when we do not give
-P-A-G-E-25
THE PHYSICAL BASIS. 25 
conscious notice to the impression, or when the result 
is not under control of the will, are called reflex actions.

crossed in sitting down, the knee is tapped smartly, the 
foot flies up. If some object be brought suddenly 
near the eyes, the lids quickly shut without our will- 
ing them to do so. 
The whole process of digestion is controlled and 
directed by reflex action. The food, as it passes through 
the different parts of the alimentary canal, furnishes the 
stimulus necessary to cause the nerve centers reflexly 
to affect the muscular coats and secretory organs of 
the digestive tract. Even the act of swallowing is reflex, 
and not voluntary beyond a certain point. If a morsel 
of food gets beyond this point, it is swallowed, whether 
we will it or not. 
The explanation of reflex action, briefly, is that an 
impression is made upon the end of some afferent 
nerve, which carries the impulse in to some ganglion 
or to the spinal cord. This reflects it on to an efferent 
nerve, which carries it to the muscle, thus causing 
muscular contraction. 
Reflex action may take place through the higher as 
well as through the lower nerve centers. Holding a 
plow in the furrow, rowing a boat, guiding a 
bicycle, are illustrations. After we become dead 
familiar with these activities,—after we have Higher : Centers. learned how,—we perform them involun- 
tarily, and without consciously noting the impression 
in response to which-the hands or legs turn this way 
or that. 
The higher forms of reflex action are the basis of

many adits, and it is one of the chief functions of the 
teacher to help his pupils form correct habits of. all 
Renex ‘Kinds. Let pupils be trained, through oft- 
Actionis repeated reflex actions, to hold the pen 
Habit. properly, to handle the pointer properly, 
to remove the hat on entering the schoolroom, to walk 
without shuffling, and to do_many other things that 
add to the good order and comfort of the school. 
Even moral conduct becomes reflex. 
There is a peculiar phenomenon, of much value to 
the teacher, connected with the fact that impressions 
made on the ends of the nerves at the sur- 
face of the body, in the skin or other sense 
organs, are carried inward to the central organs by the 
nerves, and that from the central organs impulses are 
sent out over other nerves. If the upper-lip be firmly 
pressed just under the nose when the desire to sneeze 
is felt, the act of sneezing will be prevented. In some 
way not fully understood, the impulse sent from the 
lip checks the impulse coming to the muscles that are 
used in sneezing. This checking is called zuhzbction. 
A little experimentation would: doubtless reveal many 
other such instances of inhibition in the lower forms of 
nervous and muscular activity. 
But the form of inhibition important to the teacher 
is that which is caused by the wz//. Examples of this 
Inhibition are observable every day in the play of chil- 
by will. dren and in the daily conduct of adults. To 
illustrate: If the sole of the foot is tickled, the tend- 
ency is for the leg to jerk away; but an effort of the 
will inhibits this impulse, and the leg does not move. 
If a boy gets hurt at play, the natural impulse is to cry ; 
but.the will inhibits the. nerve impulses going out to Inhibition.

the muscles that are used in crying, and the lad restrains 
what he believes to be a weakness. A man gets angry 
with his neighbor, and the first impulse is to strike him ; 
but the will inhibits the impulse starting outward to the 
muscles, and the hand is restrained. 
Then the stronger the zw7//, the greater will be the” 
self-control. Through the inhibitive power of will, bad 
habits are corrected, evil tendencies rooted out, self- 
restraint is accomplished, and character formed. 
At this point, if at no other, any materialistic theory 
of mind—anything that would identify mind with 
nerve tissue in action — must break down, for no mate- 
rialist has explained the fact that a nerve stimulus can 
come from within, in the form of a self-originating act 
of will. : 
The impossibility of discovering what the connection 
is between mind and nerve tissue has been referred to; 
but that there is an intimate connection is yy. 
shown by the commonest facts of our every- and Nerve 
day experience. Anything that affects the "*"* 
nerve tissue, especially the gray tissue of the brain, 
more or less affects the mind. 
Mental vigor depends upon nutrition as much as mus- 
cular vigor does. In fact, the brain receives a larger 
proportionate share of blood than any other organ of 
the body. Pain in any part of the body affects mental 
activity. Too much or too little blood supply in the 
brain; too much or too little sleep; narcotics, anzs- 
thetics, and all substances that affect the nervous sys- 
tem through the stomach, —all register their effects in 
an increased or diminished activity and power of mind. 
Mental action may be wholly suspended by reducing 
the supply of blood to the brain, through a pressure

upon the arteries of the neck, far short of that neces- 
sary to produce death. A clot of blood no larger than 
a wheat grain, or a minute splinter of bone from the 
skull, pressing upon the surface of the brain, is sufficient 
to change a man of culture into an ignoramus, or one 
of eminent character into a moral wreck. Every sur- 
geon can give instances of a change in mental or moral 
character as the result of accidents to the head. Epi- 
lepsy and congenital idiocy may be cured in children 
by trepanning. 
But although these facts show a most intimate. and 
vital connection between mind and brain, other facts

sical weaknesses that affect the brain or other parts of 
the body. Some of the world’s best literature has been 
written by men and women of frail physique, whose 
minds did high creative work in the midst of acute 
physical pain. Indeed, in some cases, it seems the 
frailer the body and the more acute the physical suffer- 
ing, the clearer and more active the mind. 
Whatever of value there is in “mind cure” rests 
upon the fact that mind can rise superior to, and domi- 
nate, the body. The effect of the mental 
state in the cure of disease is recognized by 
every physician as being greater sometimes than that 
of all his medicines. The patient who is in a hopeful 
frame of mind and w//s to get well, will recover far 
more rapidly than one who has lost courage or has 
grown indifferent.

condition of well people are quite marked. Sorrow

strong emotion of any kind inhibits the physical desire 
for food; and all the organs of the body are subject 
more or less to inhibition or stimulation from 4 o4:54 of 
purely mental states that in no sense have Mind upon 
their origin in the nerve tissue. Dr. Rock- Beeye 
well has shown that jaundice may be brought’ on by a 
purely mental emotion. Anger is shown in the ten- 
sion of the muscles and the clinching of the fists; ex- 
citement of any kind is outwardly manifested in the 
trembling hands, the shifting feet, or the drumming 
fingers. The mental disturbance is discharged along 
the motor nerves into the muscles. Such facts show 
that the mind affects the body quite as markedly as the 
body may affect the mind. 
One other fact remains to be specifically noted in this 
connection. Mental action is accompanied by an in- 
creased temperature and wasting of the brain; .. 34, waste 
that is, thinking, or feeling, or willing, uses up and Mental 
brain matter, and increases the heat of the “‘t°* 
brain, just as walking uses up muscle tissue, and increases 
the heat of the muscle. Intense anger, for instance, 
causes the nerve cells to explode so they ¢an almost be 
felt discharging their nervous energy; and the phrase, 
the heat of passion, is physiologically exact. 
The materialists would have us believe that drain 
waste produces mental action, that an emotion is simply 
a change in the quantity and arrangement of the mole- 
cules of brain matter. The bald statement of such 
a proposition is surely sufficient answer to it; but it 
may be worth while to reémphasize the fact that the 
mind can originate nerve impulses without having first 
received any excitation through nerve matter. 
By the phrase brain localization is meant the localiz-

the brain. This has been done to some extent with

Localization. Certain areas of the brain have been pretty 
conclusively shown to be the centers of motor activity; 
that is, from these areas of the brain substance those 
impulses start out which take effect in ordinary muscu- 
lar movements. The area of language seems to be the 
only one of the areas of the more purely intellectual 
activities that has been definitely fixed. When this 
point in the brain —situated at the lowest frontal gyrus 
—is affected by disease, there is a loss of power to utter 
or write words, or to use them correctly. This loss of 
power is called aphasia. It manifests itself in various 
ways, and presents many peculiar phenomena. 
While modern experimentation has shown that there

~ APPLICATIONS ‘TO TEACHING. 
There seems, perhaps, to the teacher-student of psy+ 
chology very little in this that he can apply to his work 
as a teacher; and in a certain sense that is true in the 
present state of investigation. . We shall doubtless have 
to wait some while yet before experimentation and ob- 
servation in this field will supply a sufficient body of 
facts to enable us to establish any definite conclusions, 
helpful to the educator, beyond what we already have. 
The psycho-physic facts upon which emphasis is placed
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE PHYSICAL BASIS. 31 
just now, and which seem to promise something worth 
the teacher's while, are (1) that in different years of the 
child’s life certain organs and perhaps certain brain areas 
become active, while others that have been active, or 
are yet to become so, are lying dormant ; (2) that there 
is some relation between size and weight of body and 
mental power; and (3) that the sexes differ materially 
in the rate of bodily development. We may be justi- 
fied in concluding from these facts that exercises should 
be planned to accord with the mode, rate, and time of 
physical variation. These points will receive further 
and fuller consideration in Chapter XXI. 
Some other practical suggestions may possibly be 
drawn from what has been’‘said in this chapter. 
1. The teacher should remember that the zugoing 
stream of nervous energy is in the child a mental stream, 
carrying external facts and impressions to an yy.0ta1 and 
awakening mind greedy to receive them; the Motor 
outgoing stream is a motor stream, controlling ™Te"** 
the bodily energies of the child, which need intelligent 
direction, but not repression. In view of the first fact, 
childhood should be surrounded with every influence, 
both in objects of sense and in human conduct, that may 
quicken the mind to a right growth. The earliest im- 
pressions make the most ineffaceable records. 
In connection with the second fact, it must. be remem- 
bered that the mind of the child has not yet become 
accustomed or fitted to its bodily investment, and that 
' therefore the growing child has but little motor control. 
In view of this, teachers of kindergarten or primary 
grades should be careful not to set any exercises except 
those requiring’ the simplest muscular adjustment. 
2. Mental activity depends largely upon brain rest and
-P-A-G-E-32
  
32 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
brain nutrition. The teacher cannot supervise nutri- 
tion, so far as food is concerned; but he can, through 
Brain Rest Ventilation and exercise, provide for thor- 
and oughly oxygenated blood and a good circula- 
Nutetion. tion’ to carry it to the brain; and he can do 
something for brain rest by having frequent recesses, 
and requiring but little study at home on the part of 
young pupils. , 
3. The ability of the brain to do its work well as the 
organ of the mind depends very greatly upon the whole 
Pte physical environment of the child, by which 
tivityana iS meant not only those things that affect the 
Physical body from its outside, but also the conditions Condition. ’ ame of the body itself, — cramped position, cold, 
irritation, nervousness, general ill feeling; or their oppo- 
sites, ease, warmth, quiet, comfort. All these things the 
teacher is mainly responsible for in the schoolroom. 
A very common error on the part of both teacher 
and parents, is to act as if children are not nervous. 
They ave, irritably so. A rasping voice, nervous move- 
ments, or an irritable temper, in teacher or parent, all 
react strongly upon children, and produce like effects in 
them. On the other hand, so susceptible are children 
to all influences, that good temper, cheerfulness, good 
humor, even good health, are “ catching,” and that child 
is fortunate whose teacher has these qualities for the 
pupils to acquire.

mind, if indeed he will but observe it, without finding 
himself face to face with the question, “ What is this 
that gains power from day to day, that seems to be 
hungry to know, and grows in strength from what it 
feeds upon; that thinks, and feels, and wills, and makes 
up the personality of the child?” 
He knows, of course, it is ménd, but what is mind?

who suppose there is no miracle in what is familiar. 
Every intelligent human being is aware that there is 
a something he calls “ myself,” —a something that is 
not his limbs, nor body, nor brain, nor all of them taken 
as a whole; for he speaks of “my hand,” “my body,” 
“my brain.” The se/f, then, the ego, is universally felt, 
even by those who do not think upon such subjects, to 
be asomething apart from the physical being, —a some- 
thing that bids the muscles contract, that sees and hears 
and tastes; a something that loves and fears, compares 
and decides. While this something is closely connected 
with and dependent upon the physical organization, it 
is not in any sense identical with it. 
We can measure the length and diameter of a nerve

fiber, we can weigh a ganglion, we can chemically analyze 
the cellular matter of the brain, after it isdead ; for these 
are matter. But none of these things can we do to the 
mind. To speak of a cubical emotion, a /inear thought, 
an acid judgment, would seem the veriest nonsense, even 
to those who had never given a half hour in their lives to 
the study of mental phenomena. 
But there is a striking analogy between the mind and 
the body in many things. The body assimilates food, 
Analogy be- 220 grows. The mind’s food is knowledge- 
tween Mind material, percepts and concepts and relations. 
and Body. Tn proportion as it assimilates these, it grows. 
This is not merely figurative, it is actual. The man has 
more mind than the child. And just as unassimilated 
food clogs the digestive system, and retards the growth 
of bodily tissue, so facts merely crammed into memory, 
and not understood, — that is, perceived in their rela- 
tions, — clog mental growth. The bodily organs de- 
velop and grow stronger by proper use. So the mind, 
like muscles, gets stronger through proper exercise. As 
an unused muscle becomes soft and weak, so memory, or 
judgment, or will, becomes ineffective through neglect, 
or misuse. 
The normal body needs activity for its growth, and so 
delights init. Every healthy animal—man or lower —

health, also delights in mental activity. To think is to 
‘live, to know is to be happy. The right use of all the 
faculties of the mind gives the highest happiness. The 
normal intellect rejoices in activity. And as the best 
time to train and direct the bodily energies to the for- 
mation of habits that shall result in the one prime end

of health is during childhood and youth, so, too, the 
best time in which to establish mental habits that shall 
lead to permanent mental vigor is during the first two 
decades of life. And as the trained gymnast or athlete 
never loses his love for well-directed bodily exercise, 
so the trained mind always delights in thinking. 
The point of greatest value to the educator is that 
the normal, healthy mind is not only active, but it is 
active in a right direction. Then the business of the 
teacher is to supply the best possible environment for 
normal growth, and to let the mind grow. 
As the body grows weary from prolonged exercise, 
and needs frequent cessation from activity, —needs rest 
and sleep, —so the mind grows weary from continued ac- 
tivity, and must have rest before it can resume its wonted 
tasks. And it must be noted that the mind can grow 
weary independently of the body, that is, when the 
body has not been active. Weariness of body affects 
the mind; and when the mind grows tired from intense 
thought, the muscles sometimes feel strained and sore, 
as if they had been guiding a plow or turning out 
spadefuls of earth all day. 
But mind and body grow weary independently. The 
body may grow tired from its continued expenditure 
of energy, while the mind is inactive; and yoy ana 
the mind, after prolonged effort, demands Body Inde- 
rest before it will do more, though the body Pengent: 
may have been quiet for hours. Such facts, of daily 
occurrence in the experience of every one, serve to 
illustrate further that mind and body, though closely 
related, are two distinct things. 
One other peculiar similarity between mind and body 
is found in the fact that mind seems to have both
-P-A-G-E-36

inertia and momentum. A railway train standing still 
is inert. Force is required to get it in motion. The 
property of inertia inherent in all matter makés it 
harder to start the train than to keep it going. The 
train in motion has what is called momentum, —accumu- 
lated motion that carries it on, even when the steam is

Momentum owing to bodily weakness or disease, or an 
inertness of its own, it has to be driven to its work; 
and often, when fully occupied upon some line of 
thought, it is equally hard to check its activity, or to 
turn it to some other subject. Every one has experi- 
enced this difficulty. 
But while these analogies are peculiar and of great 
interest, still they afford no explanation of what mind 
Mina 725. It may be stated at once that it is not 
defined. possible to know what anything 7s in its 
essence, — what snow is, what iron is, what air is. We 
know things only through their attributes. We define 
snow by its attributes of whiteness, crystalline struc- 
ture, etc.; and thus with everything. We can define 
mind only in the same way, by naming its attributes, 
or those manifestations that distinguish it from other 
things, Such a definition is the one usually given: 
Mind ts that which thinks, feels, and wills. It may be 
possible to get nearer to the truth with this definition: 
Mind ts that force which manifests itself, through organt- 
sation of nerve substance, in knowing, feeling, willing. 
No graver objections can be offered against this than 
against other definitions of mind; and it seems to sug- 
gest explanations of some phenomena that no other 
definition does.
-P-A-G-E-37
    
MIND: CONSCIOUSNESS. 37 
Force is the one thing that produces motion, and 
may be so defined. Mind produces motion in brain 
tissue, nerve fibers, and the muscles: hence minaa 
mind must be a force, or, at any rate, force Force.

clusions to be drawn from the modern theory of the 
conservation of energy. If the mind be a form of 
energy, then, it cannot suffer destruction. 
Alongside of the definition of mind just given, these 
others following are placed, some by way of other 
comparison, some by way of contrast :— Definitions. 
“ By mind we mean anything and everything that is 
comprehended under the little word ‘1’.” — Krohn. 
“The self of which we assert mental phenomena is 
called mind.” — Baldwin. 
(This is an illogical definition, since it uses words 
that are synonymous with or derived from the word to 
be defined.) i 
“ Mind is a one self-conscious entity.” — Laurie. 
“The subject of all the states of consciousness is a 
real unit-being called mind, which is of non-material 
nature, and acts and develops according to laws of its 
own.” —Ladd. 
“Force is an attribute of mind, but it zs ot mind. 
Mind, as we know it, is embodied spirit.” — Munsell. 
(What is spirit ?) 
“Mind, like force, is essentially active.” — Carpenter. 
The most striking central fact of mind is conscious-

a synonym for mzxd, by others, as the normal condi- 
tion of the mind when awake; by others, as the great 
Conscious. basic power or faculty by which the mind is 
ness: Kinds. aware of itself and its own acts, and by which 
the sense of personal identity is preserved. These 
different uses are not conflictive, but should be clearly 
discriminated as the state or condition of being con- 
scious, and the faculty of self-consciousness. 
As a state, consciousness may be defined as that con- 
dition in which the normal, waking mind does its work. 
We speak of one who has fainted, or is asleep, or who 
has been stunned by a blow, as unconscious. Self-con- 
sciousness may be defined as the basic faculty or funda- 
mental power of the mind by which it ts aware of its 
conditions and acts as being its own, and by which it 
knows that it is the same mind all the time. Hopkins 
gives it essentially the same but a somewhat briefer defi- 
nition: “Consciousness is the knowledge by the mind 
of itself as the permanent and indivisible subject of its 
own operations.” I have not been able to discover any 
definition of consciousness that is clearer or in any way 
better than this. Let the teacher study it carefully; and 
in the light of his own inner self. 
Self-consciousness, it will be seen, gives us the sense: 
of personal identity, the certainty that I am the same 
Personal being I was when I went to sleep last night, 
Identity. or when I started to school years ago. My 
feelings, my thoughts, may have changed even over 
night, and have greatly changed since childhood. I 
look at things now as a man, not as a child of six, but 
I know that I am the same / that I was last night or 
that I was at six years of age. 
The most essential peculiarity of consciousness is its

unity and continuity, which binds all the complex expe- 
riences of sense and thought into one extended and 
ever-extending series. 
We could not possibly have an idea of the sameness 
of material things, or of their changes in form or place, 
were it not for the sense of the sameness of _ gense of 
ourselves. ow do I know this desk is the entity. 
same at which I wrote yesterday? I can know only 
through the knowledge that / am the same as he who 
wrote upon it yesterday. This self-consciousness is the 
basis of individuality, of personal character, of independ. 
ence of being; and even in the child it should be sacredly 
respected by the teacher. 
Consciousness is another fact which the materialist 
must, to be consistent, either flatly deny or silently 
ignore. While it is true that changes in the blood sup- 
ply of the brain, or in the substance of that organ, directly 
affect consciousness, yet by no stretch of even the sci- 
entific imagination can consciousness be consistently 
conceived of as identical with any arrangement or organ- 
ization of matter, or asa property of matter. The mat- 
ter of the brain, as a part of the body, changes completely 
in a relatively short time, is ‘not the same to-day that it 
was yesterday ; but “ormal consciousness is the same all 
the time, —a fixed awareness of self-identity. 
Consciousness may well be compared to the circle of 
clear white light thrown on the screen by a stereopti- 
con. In this circle must appear all the pic- i : Conscious- tures before they can be seen and enjoyed. hess com-

lies outside the clear spot, and we are not able fully to 
recognize them. Though this is wholly figurative, it is 
none the less true that into consciousness must come 
every percept of the external world, every concept, every 
act of judgment, or imagination, or will, before these can 
be of any value tous. We can now nothing, fee/ noth- 
ing, w2// nothing, outside of consciousness. . It seems to 
me that upon consciousness should be placed our moral 
responsibility as well as upon the wl, and that it is 
nearer the truth to speak of a free consciousness than of 
a free will. We are not in any sense responsible for 
acts that are committed unconsciously, in a state of delir- 
ium, somnambulism, or hypnotism. Will is responsible 
only as we are conscious of its action. 
There is an aggravated or perverted form of the sense 
of self, commonly called sedf-consciousness, which may 
Morbid Con- Manifest itself either in a morbid sensitiveness 
sciousness. (shyness, bashfulness, timidity) or in an exag- 
gerated self-conceit. Both are common in children and 
young people, and are indeed quite frequently found 
associated together. A very familiar illustration is found 
in the feeling of young people that they are the cyno- 
sure of all critical eyes whén on the street, in a railway 
car, or in any congregation of their fellows. 
It should be the effort of every teacher to relieve and 
tone down these feelings of timidity and of self-conceit 
in his pupils, but not to eliminate them. Morbid self- 
sensitiveness may be made to ripen into modesty, cor- 
rect deportment, and a watchful imitation of the polite 
usages of society. Abounding self-conceit may be toned 
into a sound self-confidence, a faith in one’s self that 
marks the leader of men and the doer of things. 
One other form of self-sensitiveness remains to be

noted, which those people suffer from,(who have carried 
morbid self-inspection to an extreme, examining their 
motives, analyzing their feelings, wondering 
about their morals or religion, etc. Children Seamer 
of either sex, of nervous temperament, are sensitive- 
subject to this kind of torture, for it is tor- Rate 
ture. When the teacher has the insight to discover 
this condition in any child, he should be very tolerant 
and sympathetic. It is a kind of disease. 
The degree of intensity of normal self-consciousness 
varies greatly in different individuals. Many people

confess that they act more from impulse and whim than

their station in life. They have an air of irresponsi- 
bility about them that unfits them for positions where 
purposive work, of even a low order, isto be done. The 
world has need of people who Let their consciousness per- 
meate their work. The idea is fully expressed by the 
homely phrase, so often addressed to children, “Think 
what youare doing.” The saying of the new education, 
that “we learn to do by doing,” is true in its best sense 
only when the doing is consciously directed.

rather other consciousness (such as trance, cataleptic

those whose business it is to have the care and healing

Dr. Maudsley says, “There is not an inconsistency 
or contradiction of which human nature is not capable; 
not a folly of belief or an absurdity of practice which 
has not been cherished by some people or other at some 
period or other of human history.” There is no trick 
too fantastic for consciousness to play. 
As it is the business of the observer of nature to 
classify what he sees, and to bring all observed phe- 
Mental 20Mena into a few groups, so it is the busi- 
Activities ness of the student of mind to classify its

into the same class. Any one, however unskilled in this 
sort ‘of investigation, can, upon a slight examination of 
the workings of his own mind, readily discover three 
classes of activities. He thinks and knows and im- 
agines; he feels love and fear and shame and joy; and 
he wills to do this or that thing. The powers of the 
mind by which these various acts are performed are 
conveniently classified under the intellect, sensibilities 
or feelings, and the will. This classification receives 
the sanction and approval of a long line of investi- 
gators, and any attempt to change it must inevitably 
result in the coining of new terms that are much less 
apt and expressive. Even the materialistic psycholo- 
gists, who are averse to any classification that intro- 
duces the term faculties, may fall into the use of it 
when a little off their guard. 
But any classification of mental phenomena that 
stops with an enumeration of the facultdes of the mind 
is incomplete, since it omits any proper grouping and 
description of the operations and processes that these
-P-A-G-E-43

faculties are constantly engaged in during our normal 
waking hours. These operations and processes will be 
described and analyzed later; and it is only necessary 
to refer to them here as acgudsition, or the collecting 
of the material for mental growth; assémdlation, or the 
elaboration of this material,—the organiza-’ operations

and character; and reproduction, or the putting-forth of 
the elaborated thought so that it may affect other minds. 
APPLICATIONS TO TEACHING. 
The deductions of value to the teacher that may be 
drawn from this chapter can be summarized as follows :— 
1. The mind, as has been seen, needs nourishment, 
use, and rest, in order to its sound growth. The 
teacher, then, should see to it that such exercises be 
given to the child as will nourish the mind at the differ- 
ent stages of its development. It is imperative that the 
lessons be adapted to the power of the child to ‘assimi- 
late; that is,tounderstand. Stuffing the child’s memory 
with facts he cannot understand is worse than stuffing 
his stomach with food he cannot digest. 
2. It is the natural tendency of every faculty of the 
mind, as it is of every organ “of the body, to do the 
work for which it is fitted in such way as to give pleas- 
ure. Pleasure in doing is a law of both mind and body ; 
and growth from use is a law of equal validity. If the 
child does not like to learn,—to learn something, for 
all children do not like to learn the same things, —the 
teacher should carefully examine his methods of teach- 
ing to discover why, before he accuses the child of a 
perverse desire for ignorance. Also from this law of
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
use the teacher should learn the lesson that it.is what 
the child does for himself that makes for his growth. 
The teacher might as well eat the child’s food for him 
as to do his thinking for him. 
3. The teacher should put into effect the law of rest 
by providing short lessons and other mental exercises, 
and frequent intermissions for relaxation and play. It 
is wrong, both physiologically and pedagogically, to try 
to teach a tired child. 
4. As the digestive processes are stimulated by the 
proper cooking and seasoning of the food, so the pro- 
cesses of mental assimilation may be stimulated by the 
proper preparation and presentation of thought material 
by the teacher. There is a way to teach so that every 
lesson and every exercise shall be flavored with interest, 
and the teacher who finds out this way is the one whose 
pupils through all their lives will call him blessed. 
5. The teacher must constantly strive to secure the 
conscious, ‘self-directed effort of the pupil; for work 
that is consciously done with a purposive effort is the 
only kind that is worth anything. The best way to 
secure this kind of work is sympathetically to let the 
child understand the ed for which he is working, and 
that the teacher is working with him to that end. 
This end toward which the effort is to be directed must 
be set before the child or youth in such form as will 
make it attractive in itself, and will arouse a compelling 
interest. The teacher should often show the relation 
of each study or of each lesson to practical everyday 
affairs, and the relations of different studies to one’ an- 
other. This will prevent the formal, routine work that 
is done so often while the higher consciousness of the 
pupil is busy with other things.

MIND: CONSCIOUSNESS. 45 
CONSCIOUSNESS BELOW MAN. 
Modern psychological methods have opened up anew 
the interesting inquiry whether the lower animals have 
mind. No intelligent observer of the acts Abita 
and habits of animals can doubt that they Mind. 
afford all the zxdications of mind that man exhibits. 
They can attend, and form habits; can feel fear, joy, 
' shame; can reason in some degree; and can will. It 
remains to be determined whether animals have a sense 
ef guilt following upon wrong doing, and a sense of 
pleasure after right doing; and whether they have real 
self-consciousness. Those who are interested in mind as 
mind can gain much from a study of its manifestations 
in the lower animals. 
It is even claimed by some that a lower form of con- 
sciousness, not rising into self-consciousness, marks the 
lowest life forms. If that be true, then there is a dim 
consciousness in the oyster, in plants, in the monad. 
When it comes to proof of such possibilities, there 
is more to be found in favor than against. yj seat 
There could be no grander demonstration Conscious- 
on the part of science than to show that ™* 
there is a universal consciousness working everywhere, 
animating and transforming lower life forms into 
higher, manifesting itself as the divine purpose.

CHAPTER V. 
CONDITIONS OF MENTAL ACTIVITY. 
CONSCIOUSNESS. 
THERE are certain physical conditions of the mind’s 
activity —brain nutrition, brain rest, etc.— which have 
already been touched upon. It is now proposed to 
discuss the three fundamental psychical conditions of 
the mind’s best activity. Consciousness, attention, 
and habit occupy this chapter together, although they 
have nothing in common except the fact of being the 
psychical conditions in which the mind does its most 
effective work. To accomplish a given task in the 
shortest time, with the least waste of energy, and with 
the best results, the mind must be conscious, attentive, 
and habituated to the kind of activity demanded by 
the work to be done. It is not forgotten that we may 
do many things semiconsciously, or even unconsciously ; 
and that we may do many things well which we have 
not done before, and so could not be in the habit of 
doing; but it is none the less true that we must do a 
thing many times consciously and attentively, before we 
can do that or similar things unconsciously and auto- 
matically. z 
The general statements just made find ample, spe- 
cific illustration in many familiar facts. The bicyclist 
had to be intensely conscious of what he was doing, 
and to give it exclusive attention, for a longer or

  CONDITIONS OF MENTAL ACTIVITY. 47 
shorter time, before he could ride as automatically as: 
he walks. Askilled mechanic will learn the use of a 
new tool much more quickly than a teacher, because 
the mechanic is habituated to handling tools, while the 
teacher is not. 
It is worth noting, however, that intense se/f-con- 
sciousness is not favorable to the best activity. If the 
child is too conscious of the way in which he forms 
each letter, after he has once learned to write, his work 
will be neither so rapid nor so good as if he is simply 
conscious that he is writing, and wants to write well. 
ATTENTION. 
Attention is that condition of the mind in which the 
energy of one or more faculties is directed upon an object 
of sense or of thought. The word is also used to name 
the act of attending. Attention is often miscalled a 
faculty ; but it is plain that it is not, since attention 
does nothing, but is only a quickened or energized 
state of one or more faculties. 
There are three kinds of attention, — voluntary, in- 
voluntary, and expectant, —and each is worth  xinds of 
‘the teacher’s careful study. * GHERMOR. 
. Voluntary attention is that kind in which the wd] 
directs the faculties upon some thing to be considered. 
The word attention means literally a stretching-to. 
The will stretches the mind forth to the thing to be 
seen, or done, or thought upon. In this phase of atten- 
tion, the we// is the faculty which brings about the con- 
dition. The will may not only arouse the faculties from 
an indifferent or idle condition, and direct them upon 
some object, but it may draw them off from the con- 
sideration of one thing to put them at work upon an-
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  48 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
other. We may cease attending to a recitation in order 
to discipline the room; we may withdraw our observa- 
tion from a beautiful sunset, and attend to the lesson 
to be studied. 
Involuntary attention is that kind in which the mind 
is drawn by interest to the consideration of something. 
We involuntarily attend to anything which excites our 
interest or curiosity. An unusual sight or noise is sure 
to be attended to. Whatever is curious, new, or in any 
way attractive, is certain to be an object of attention. 
Indeed, the word attractzve is, in its literal meaning, the 
correlative of attention, for it means to draw to. .An 
attractive thing draws the mind to a consideration of 
it. This fact is of the highest value to the teacher. 
Everything about the school yard, the house, the room, 
the recitation, — every exercise, in fact, should be made 
as attractive as possible. 
Children, and, for the matter of that, many adults, 
cannot give voluntary attention for any considerable 
Chitaren's length of time. The power to hold the mind 
Attention steadily toa line of work is characteristic only 
nvoluntary- of the most highly trained and disciplined 
intelligences, and has by some been said to be genius. 
The reader may look into his own experience, or try 
the experiment of keeping his mind closely for even a 
half hour to the, consideration of something not espe- 
cially interesting, and he will readily see how difficult 
it is to compel his attention to uninteresting things. It 
is worse than useless to expect children to attend to 
what lacks interest for them, or fails to arouse their curi- 
Object Osity. In this fact is found the truest reason 
Teaching. for object teaching. It may be stated thus: 
there can be no effective teaching without the attention
-P-A-G-E-49
  
CONDITIONS OF MENTAL ACTIVITY. 49 
of the pupils; the child cannot attend unless zxterested ; 
and he will not be interested in adstractions, but in things 
that he can see and handle. Stated more concisely, the 
argument is this: no good teaching without atzention ; 
no attention without zz¢erest ; no interest without od- 
jects. And the argument holds good for all grades of 
students, from the kindergarten to the university. The 
university of to-day has “ object lessons” in almost every 
department of study, as witness the splendidly equipped 
laboratories, museums, maps, pictures, etc., that are in 
daily use. No teacher of a country school should for a 
moment think that he can teach well without illustra- 
tive material, any more than the professor of chemistry 
can without alaboratory. Itisonly necessary to remem- 
ber that the apparatus must be adapted to the pupil’s 
ability and advancement, and to the subject of instruc- 
tion. 
It is questionable, indeed, whether any one, adult or 
child, trained or untrained, can attend unless interest is 
the mainspring of the effort. We set our-,1, a ention 
selves often to the accomplishment of dis- due to 
agreeable tasks, to the doing of things we are "**r*s* 
not interested in, but not unless by doing these things 
we can attain some desired end, or can eventually gain 
some object of interest. The student plods through 
many a dull and tasteless task because by doing so he 
may secure some coveted knowledge or increased power 
of thought. No amount of will can make a successful 
merchant out of a man who is not interested eben bins 
in buying and selling, who is not attracted Basis of 
by the methods of business; nor cana man S"°°*s* 
who is interested only in prices and the state of the 
market attain success in a liberal profession. Interest

must produce attention, and upon attention depends 
success in any work. 
Teaching is almost wholly lost upon inattentive 
classes. Arouse, stimulate, attract the attention of 
pupils, and teaching is easy. Do not try to compel 
attention: the kind of attention pupils give through 
compulsion is of but little value, except as it holds 
them to a task long enough for the teacher to convince 
them of its attractiveness and worth. 
There can be no doubt that the mind can attend to 
more than one object at a time. To sing and play an 
Divided accompaniment, to use a complicated ma- 
Attention. chine, to teach a class and observe the order 
of the room, — all these, and thousands of other things 
we do every day, necessitate keeping the mind busy 
with several things at once. It is said that Caesar could 
dictate seven letters at once. It has been asserted that 
expert stenographers can with one hand take down a 
speech in shorthand, and with the other write out the 
stenographic copy into longhand. 
But it is also true that the zztensity of attention 
diminishes with the number and variety of objects 
attended to. To bring about the most effective con- 
centration of thought, the field of mental vision must 
be narrowed as much as possible, and the objects con- 
sidered must be related. 
The teacher should require but few things to be done 
or studied together, and those things should have an 
evident and simple relationship. A subject should be 
presented to a class connectedly, so that attention may 
not be diffused and weakened. 
The power to attend can be readily cultivated by 
persistent practice. It vivifies consciousness, intensi-

fies impressions, fixes objects in memory, and makes 
all mental and physical work effective. Anything that 
strengthens 74/7 gives increased power to Qutivation 
attend, to hold the mind at work upon a of the Power 
task with its faculties focused. The power ‘**t?* 
of attention is easily weakened by overmuch reading 
of newspapers, light literature, and flashy fiction. 
Teachers will find the subjoined suggestions of some 
value in securing and holding the attention of classes. 
1. Every new subject should, when possible, be intro- 
duced objectively. Let there be something to see, or. 
hear, or feel, — something besides mere words. 
2. Be careful to have the pupil’s eyes upon your face 
or upon the objects you are using. 
3. Do not try to present many new ideas in any given 
exercise. ‘‘ The zwtensity of attention is inversely as its 
extensity.” Don’t “scatter.” 
4. Speak in a low tone, clearly, and distinctly, and let 
the pupils understand that you will rarely repeat ques- 
tions or statements. 
5. Ask the question first ; then call the name of the 
pupil who is to answer. 
6. Ask your questions promptly, and require prompt 
answers. ; 
7. Study ways of presenting subjects and of asking 
questions so as to arouse the curiosity of the pupils. 
8. Surprise the inattentive pupil by an unexpected 
question. 
g. Abolish routine questioning, — round the class from 
head to foot. Let every pupil understand that he is 
liable to be called on at any time to answer any ques- 
tion, or to criticise or supplement the answer of an- 
other pupil. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
10. Carefully vary your methods of conducting a 
recitation. 
11. Attention uses up brain cells rapidly. Let all 
exercises be brief. 
12. Above all, be interested yourself, and show that 
you are. 
It is scarcely necessary to say that no teacher can 
successfully apply these suggestions if the text-book is 
used in “hearing a lesson.” Put the text-book aside, 
and make your own questions. 
There is another kind of attention known as exfec- 
tant attention, which may be defined as that condition 
Expectant 2% which the mind dwells upon something that 
Attention. 75 expected, and that is dreaded or desired. 
Carpenter, who gives this phase of attention a thorough 
and most interesting discussion, defines it as a condition 
in which the “whole mind is possessed with the idea 
that a certain action will take place, and is eagerly 
directed towards the indications of its occurrence.” 
By fixing the attention with a dreading expectancy 
upon bodily symptoms, they may be greatly exagger- 
Bxpecent ated, and disease may even be induced in a 
Attention part where none existed before. Such is the 
and Disease. intimate and peculiar connection of mental 
states with physical states, that any part of the body — 
the foot, the head, a tooth, the stomach— will respond 
toa fixed expectancy that pain will be felt in that organ. 
Numerous wellsauthenticated cases are on record in 
which serious changes in the tissue, or in the blood sup- 
ply, or in the working of an organ, have been brought 
about by expectant attention. Advertisers of patent 
medicines take advantage of these facts, and by describ- 
ing the symptoms of disease easily succeed in getting

CONDITIONS OF MENTAL ACTIVITY, 53 
nervous people, who think overmuch of their physical 
condition, to imagine that they have many of the ills 
that flesh is heir to. Reputable physicians rely greatly 
upon hopeful expectant attention to aid their medicine 
in the rapid and effective cure of patients. Expectant 
attention, according as it is hopeful or the reverse, is a 
potent factor for good or ill in the treatment of all ner- 
vous diseases. Even serious organic or constitutional 
disease has been absolutely cured solely through the 
positive conviction in the mind of the sufferer that he 
would get well as the result of something done for him. 
Such cures of scrofula by the “ King’s touch” in Eng- 
land are too well attested to be doubted; and the effi- 
cacy of “bread pills” is well known. 
Every one who has lived in the Southern States, and 
has used his opportunities to gain information upon 
the subject, is aware of the not infrequent illness or 
death of negroes simply from the conviction that they 
had been “conjured.” Many a boy will attest the 
fact—for it zs a fact—that warts have been taken off 
his hands by his cutting as many notches in a persim- 
mon tree as he had warts., As the notches heal, the 
warts disappear. There is a host of neighborhood 
superstitions whose foundation is in expectant atten- 
tion. Such are the beliefs in the various : 7 ; Expectant signs of luck and ill luck, in the many de- attention 
vices for “reading the future,” and in the oneal 
efficacy of hazel forks and divining rods in 
locating streams of water or mineral veins beneath the 
surface of the ground. Hardly any neighborhood is 
without its “water witch,” who, on occasion, gravely 
takes a hazel fork, grasping the end of one prong in each 
hand, and walks solemnly back and forth over a given
-P-A-G-E-54
54 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
area to determine, by the “dipping” of the fork, where 
a well may be sunk, and even how deep it will need to be! 
The explanation of this sort of “witchery” is simple. 
No matter how thoroughly honest the man may be, he 
has some notion, from the “lay of the land,” where 
water may be found by digging. Having faith in his 
hazel fork, as he has, he exfec¢s it to turn at the point 
where he thinks water may be found, and this expectancy 
is all that is needed to start the muscular impulse that 
will throw the “teetering” fork over, in spite of his 
honest attempts to hold it. In firmly grasping the 
small, limber ends of a forked twig, the spasmodic con- 
tractions of the strained muscles soon draw his hands 
ever so slightly apart or together, and thus throw the 
point of the top-heavy fork downward. If “ water 
witches” could work as well blindfolded as with their 
eyes open, sceptics might have more faith in their 
performances. 
Enough has been said to show that many, if not all, 
of the phenomena of “table tilting,” “planchette writ- 
ing,” etc., may be explained in the same way. It isa 
well-known fact that “sceptics” —that is, those who do 
not have the requisite expectancy—fail to get results 
from table or planchette. Many a“ humorist” receives 
the reward of laughter because he is advertised as hu- 
morous ; and people come to hear him, expecting to 
laugh. 
Some knowledge of the many and peculiar results of 
expectant attention opens for the teacher a wide field 
Expectant Of inestimable usefulness. Children are spe-

that the truth will be told on playground and in class,

ant and his real difficulties few, that teacher will have 
prime results from the start. 
No description of a peculiar disease or its symptoms, — 
no account of unusual crimes or accidents, should be 
told or read in the hearing of children. Dr. Van Norden 
says, “It should be a fixed habit to divert attention 
from personal pain, from the foul, morbid, and horrible, 
and to keep the mind sweet and clean, hopeful and 
aspiring, stored only with facts and fancies of the true, 
the beautiful, and the good.” And since every teacher 
should be, so far as in him lies, a revealer of truth not 
only to his pupils, but to the community in which he 
works, he should discreetly use every opportunity to 
point out and prove the absurdity of popular supersti- 
tions, based on expectant attention mixed with ready 
credulity and untrained observation. 
HABIT. 
Habit is that condition of the.mind or body which is 
manifested in the tendency to unconscious repetition, of 
acts or states. For example, we say of one that he 
has a habit of eating too rapidly; of another, he has a 
habit of telling the truth. Acts or states that are now 
habitual may once have been partly or wholly under 
control of the will. It is possible, for instance, that 
the action of the heart, now wholly automatic in man 
and the higher animals, may have been, in preceding 
life forms, consciously directed. Such auto- 
matic actions may be called organic or life 
habits. What are called the zstincts of animals are Instinct.
-P-A-G-E-56
56 ; PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
race habits, —habits acquired through the lifetime of.a 
species, or perhaps an order, instead of during the life 
of the individual. Man, too, has his instincts as well 
as his individual habits. The characteristic actions of 
animals are probably for the most part due to instinct; 
but there can be no doubt that some of their actions 
y are rational. This distinction may be drawn Difference to ue between between instinct and reason: zzstinct enables 
Instinct and its possessor to adapt himself to conditions 
that arose in the history of the race; reason 
enables its possessor to adapt himself to conditions 
that arise in the experience of the zudividual. If this 
isa true distinction, then many animals have the rational 
faculty. 
, Habit is the result of repetition. Doing a thing a 
certain way once makes it easier to do it that way 
Saat ‘a second time, and each repetition makes the 
formed by thing easier to do. If a nerve carries a cer- 
Repetition. tain kind of impression inward once, it is 
easier for that kind of impression to travel along that 
nerve again than to follow a new nerve path. Also, if 
a thought impulse moves outward along certain nerves, 
and is expressed in the action of certain muscles, these 
nerves will more readily carry, and the same muscles 
will more easily express, the same kind of thought im- 
pulse a second time, than will other nerves and muscles. 
This is an illustration of what is called the daw of 
' least resistance. Any body or any force moves in the 
‘path that offers the least obstruction to its passage. 
The formation of “nes of habit in the nerves and 
muscles, brain and mind, bears a very real resemblance 
to the work of rivers in forming their channels. Let 
alone, the water will find and use the line of least re-

CONDITIONS OF MENTAL ACTIVITY. 57 
sistance; curbed and directed, it can be forced to make 
channels where it would not naturally run. Thought 
impulses, left to themselves, will form paths in brain 
and nerve, and become habitual in expression by cer- 
tain outward acts. Controlled and directed by the 
will, these thought impulses may be made to originate 
nerve tracks, or to change those already formed, and 
to find outward expression in better forms of doing. 
Habits are physical, intellectual, and moral. crasses of 
Further illustration of the formation of habit Habits. 
will be given in the discussion of each of these kinds. 
Walking is a physical habit. The child’s first at- 
tempts to walk require his closest attention, the most 
intense consciousness, andthe strongest application of 
his will. When the various will impulses have found 
the nerve paths that léad most readily to the muscles 
of the lower limbs, and the muscular actions have be- 
come correlated, then walking ceases to make demands 
upon consciousness, and becomes an unconscious, auto- 
matic process, wholly directed, under all ordinary con- * 
ditions, by the reflex nerve centers. How conscious 
volitional action passes over into unconscious automatic 
action, is illustrated in learning to swim, to ride a bicycle, ~ 
to perform any feat of athletic skill. 
Children have to learn all those muscular movements - 
which in the adult seem automatic. The infant,can 
make nocoérdinated movements, except pos- muscular

or instinct. The child must /earn to hold objects, to 
pick them up, to carry his hand to his mouth, to turn 
his eyes or his head, to crawl, to stand, to walk, to talk. 
The nerve tracks along which travel the impulses that 
produce these acts are all formed in the nerve wilder-

ness by the constant effort of the child between birth 
and two years of age. Of course, the lines which these 
motor paths must follow have been determined by no 
one dares say how many centuries of development; but 
each child of the race must learn anew how to drive the 
impulses along these established lines, and make the 
road smooth from wl to muscle. The motor nerves 
run from brain to arm or leg, in the infant as directly 
as in the man; but they are like roads that have been 
carefully surveyed and marked out, but that are not yet 
opened for travel. It takes a deal of labor to open 
them; and any one who takes the pains to watch the. 
effort of a child three months old to carry his rubber 
ring to his mouth, even after it has been put into his 
hand, will appreciate the comparison. 
Observing closely, thinking clearly and quickly, re- 
membering accurately and readily, are examples of good 
Intellectual 22¢ellectualhabits. To these should be added

statement is not necessarily lying. The motive that un-

is lying or intellectual slouchiness.) Intellectual habits,

trained minds. A habit of close observation is a mis- 
leading phrase, unless somewhat narrowly modified. A 
man may be a close observer of. geological phenomena 
and at the same time almost blind to the most interest- 
ing peculiarities of plants and animals. The scientist 
(of a sort) may keenly observe the facts of biology, and 
not even see the blending colors of sky and rock and 
wood and field; while the artist would observe the

shifting color scenes, and have no eye for the inner 
structural differences of plants and animals. All this is 
equally true of habits of remembering, thinking, will- 
ing. A student may form a habit of thinking clearly 
and quickly in arithmetic, while he can think in gram- 
mar or remember in geography only with difficulty. 
It is granted that much of these differences of ability is 
due to natural aptitude or inaptitude, but even more 
is due to habit. The morality of a habit is to be sought 
in the motives that originated it or cause its continuance. 
Constant, careless disregard of known watural — orai 
laws, resulting in disease, is morally wrong; Habits. 
while ignorant transgression of these laws is not, so long 
as the transgressor is not responsible for his ignorance. 
The same may be said, within certain limits, of the trans- 
gression of moral law. The habit of inaccuracy is a 
wretched one, but it is not zmoral except when it is 
formed or kept up from a desire to deceive others. In 
such a case an inaccurate statement is a lie. 
Moral habits may all besummed up under three heads, 
—hygienic observance, veracity and honesty. Each of 
these is to be understood in its broadest sense. To use 
tobacco, knowing its effects, is hygienically immoral; 
to be inaccurate about anything, with evil intent, is to 
lie; to take, legally or illegally, any kind’ of property 
of others, is theft; to be of unchaste habits is to violate 
the laws of hygiene, truth, and honesty. Telling truth 
once or lying once does-not form a habit; but each time 
either is done, the corresponding habit becomes more 
firmly fixed. 
Dr. Maudsley sums up the value of habit when he 
says, “We are the useful machines we are in the work 
of life, only because the great majority of our ordinary  
-P-A-G-E-60

acts and judgments have been rendered automatic and 
unconscious. Virtue itself is not safely lodged until 
Valueof it has becomea habit.” Powell, in his “He- 
Habit. - redity from God,” declares, “Take it all in 
all, ninety-nine hundredths of all a man does he does 
automatically.” That leaves his brain time and strength 
to attend to other affairs. ‘Only at the aggressive edge 
of purpose, where effort seizes upon the new, are we 
conscious:”’ all else is, or ought to be, automatic. Ward 
says, “The process of ideation [conscious thinking] is 
physiologically very expensive.” It uses up brain sub- 
stance. No man could be a great thinker if he had to. 
give conscious attention to walking ; there would be no 
literature if writing were not automatic ; there could be 
~ no skill of any kind were it not for habit. The watch- 
maker’s fingers must work of themselves; the surgeon’s 
muscles must know how far to contract; the singer’s 
vocal cords must fix their own tension; the orator’s 
words must come without search, and leave his brain 
free to think. The more work consciousness can hand 
over to habit, the greater the opportunity to rise into 
new and higher modes of thought and activity. The 
more we can do automatically through the lower nerve 
centers, the more power we have left to use in the strug- 
gle up to higher levels of thinking, feeling, and willing. 
All this is true only when the habits formed are right

and obliteration of conscience. Even when habits are 
not evil, they may do harm by so fixing and “solidify-

work to, pull one’s self out of the worn grooves of habit 
and learn to think and do new things, or adapt one’s 
self to new customs. This fact explains much of the 
difficulty and ineffectiveness of reform work among the 
ignorant and low. Any real reform of such people must 
be based on ‘changed habits of eating, drinking, sleep- 
ing, caring for the person, etc.; and it is hard to get 
such people to make any change in these things. 
No one is free from the danger of intellectual and 
moral inertia, and no one can afford to let the pur 
posive edge of consciousness grow dull. 
APPLICATIONS TO TEACHING. 
Back of the school stands the greatest factor in form, 
ing habits,—the home. The things a child learns to do 
first, the way he learns of doing them; the words he 
learns to speak first,and the ways in whichhe pany 
learns to speak them; the intellectual and Habits. 
moral surroundings of his first six years, —these tend to 
become fixed in his consciousness; and to remove them 
is often more than the most helpful teacher can do, 
after the child comes under his care. The unseen, un- 
felt nerve paths for impressions and impulses seem 
harder to change than the courses of rivers. Hundreds 
of cultured men and women whose early surroundings . 
were not helpful in the formation of correct habits are 
forced to be constantly on guard against lapses of pro- 
nunciation or syntax, or some of the many conven. 
tions of polite society. No matter how thoroughly one 
may think he has put early provincialisms out of his 
vocabulary, he will almost certainly revert to their use 
when he is excited, and consciousness is off guard. 
These are illustrations, merely, of an important and 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
deep-lying fact, whose value to the teacher is evident. 
In the school the child must form as many right habits 
as possible, and reform such as may stand in the way 
of his progress. 
But the teacher can do much, and should spare no 
wise effort to drill his pupils into habits of cleanliness, 
neatness, orderliness, punctuality, courtesy, quickness, ac- 
curacy, obedience, and veracity. It is better to send 
forth'a pupil with these, and without much knowledge 
of arithmetic or formal grammar, than to fill him with 
knowledge and have him lacking in right tendencies. 
Cleanliness is next to godliness, and probably stands 
first, for surely no unclean face can reflect the image of 
. , Habitsin God. Soap and water are powerful mission- 
School. aries. Veatness is simply an extension of 
cleanliness from the skin outward, to the clothes, the 
desk, the bedroom, the kitchen, the workshop. Pupils 
should be required to come into the schoolroom with 
clean shoes, with their clothes properly fastened, with 
their hair brushed; and they should beheld responsible, 
while in the room, for the condition of the floor and of 
their desks, for the appearance of the blackboard and 
the papers upon which any kind of written work is , 
done. Neatness and orderliness are among the chief 
elements in correct deportment. 
Orderliness is closely akin to neatness, and the one can- 
not be cultivated without the other. No pupil should 
be permitted to sit, stand, or walk, slouchily and lazily. 
The teacher must unceasingly (but not naggingly) insist 
upon the erect position in sitting or standing, and must 
allow no shuffling in walking. Carried into the work 
of the school, orderliness means that the books and 
papers on the’ desks shall be kept in proper arrange- 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  
  CONDITIONS OF MENTAL ACTIVITY. 03 
ment; that all written work—solutions, diagrams, 
maps, essays, etc.—shall be done according to some 
definite, standard form. The excellent drill which it 
gives in orderliness is sufficient to justify manual train- 
ing, if it had no other advantages. There is much 
untidy and disorderly work going on everywhere; and 
that kind of work means waste,— waste of time, of 
effort, and of material. In the child should be formed 
habits of order, that the man or the woman may plan 
clearly and execute rapidly. 
Punctuality is one of the cardinal virtues. The tardy 
man or woman steals time,—the time of those who 
wait. The child should be taught to come in from 
play upon the stroke of the bell, to be in his place at 
the opening of school or*class, and to return directly 
home without delay. It is as easy to be three minutes 
early as ten minutes late. In the home and in the 
school everything should go by the clock. 
Courtesy is, of course, as much a matter of heart as 
a matter of adit, springing as much from a desire to 
please or help as from practice in forms of politeness; 
but both heart and habit can be cultivated. The boy 
should be so habituated, for example, to removing his 
hat upon entering a house or meeting a lady, that he 
will do sounconsciously. Children of both sexes should 
be habituated to silence in the presence of their elders, 
to giving them precedence through doors or gates, to the 
“thank you” and “if you please” that mark the well- 
bred person. In addition to its value as one of the 
minor morals, unfailing courtesy is of the highest value 
in winning success in any field of labor. The young 
man or young woman in whom it is not a habit is 
heavily handicapped.
-P-A-G-E-64
    
64 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
Quickness, though a valuable habit, should never be 
sought at the expense of neatness, orderliness, or accu- 
racy. It comes only from persistent practice, combined 
with more or less of natural aptitude for rapid action of 
mind orbody. The child must be trained to do all work, 
and all play too, quickly but neatly, and, above all, 
accurately. Many exercises should be set in school, in- 
volving the doing of something in a given brief time. 
Drills in quick addition, subtraction, and all other 
arithmetical operations; in reading, spelling, especially 
in pronouncing, writing; in running, catching, climbing, 
etc.,—should be a fixed part of the teacher’s daily work. 
But accuracy is the chiefest intellectual virtue. To 
know exactly, to remember correctly, to state colorlessly, 
the precise facts,— these are rare accomplishments, and 
no effort should be spared to attain them for one’s self, 
or to cultivate them in those for whose training and 
character we are responsible. A teacher cannot be too 
particular about the “little things” in a school exercise. 
Children must be taught to respect detadls; and not 
quite right but near enough, about the required amount, 
nearly the correct answer, are expressions of inaccuracy 
and careless work, that should never be used by either 
pupils or teacher. In forming habits of accuracy, also, 
manual training is of the highest value. 
_ Obedience to lawful authority, in home and state, is 
~ the corner stone of the social fabric. The child that 
forms the habit of intelligent obedience in home and 
school will grow into a law-abiding citizenhood. The 
one who is permitted to fix habits of disobedience to 
parent or teacher will in very many cases learn obedi- 
ence in reformatories and prisons. There seems now to 
be a grave weakening of respect and regard for author-
-P-A-G-E-65
CONDITIONS OF MENTAL ACTIVITY. 65 
ity in state and nation, —a growing contempt for law. 
There can be no doubt that this condition is directly 
traceable, in large measure, to the greatly increased 
freedom from authority, from which children suffer at 
home and in school. This decay of home authority 
has become almost a national characteristic, and it is 
undoubtedly responsible for much of the lawlessness 
that exists within our borders. Parents and teachers 
must enforce an intelligent obedience to rational com- 
mands, that shall be as prompt as it should be invariable. 
Veracity is accuracy carried forward into the moral 
sphere. There is an intimate but not necessary con- 
nection between intellectual accuracy, and veracity. 
A boy may be habitually accurate in arithmetic or 
manual training, or outdoor observation, and yet be an 
habitual moral liar. Truth-telling must ‘be cultivated 
as adistinct habit in morals. In many respects it is of 
the first importance. Every teacher is ready to testify 
that teaching and managing a school would be infinitely 
easier than it is now, if pupils had a fixed habit of telling 
the absolute truth. 
The Zow of forming habits in school may be summed 
up in two words,—dri// and imitation. The teacher 
must @ri// the pupils every day, patiently, jo. 4, 
persistently, sympathetically, until the nerve _form 
tracks of thought and action are fixed in the ">" 
young brains and bodies. Pupils must be drilled in 
walking, sitting, standing, until correct posture becomes 
fixed habit; they must be drilled in spelling until the 
sound of a word will excite the almost automatic action 
of the muscles by which its letters are uttered or writ- 
ten; they must be drilled in the fundamentals of arith- 
metic until sum, product, difference, or quotient, of the 
Roark Psych. — 5.
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
quantities used, will be presented to consciousness with 
machine-like precision. A pupil in addition, for exam- 
ple, should not stop to think 8 and 9 are 17, but at sight 
of the two figures should think 77 at once. The me- 
chanics of composition must be drilled into the learner 
until capitalization, punctuation, and paragraphing will 
take care of themselves, and leave the brain free to pro- 
duce ideas. But drilling comes to naught if the teacher 
does not show in himself the habits he would have his 
pupils grow into. In these matters the pupils will do 
as the teacher does, rather than as he Ze//s them to do. 
A teacher sitting behind a disordered desk cannot 
chide a pupil for lack of neatness; the lazy teacher 
cannot have a punctual school; the deceitful teacher 
will send out ready liars. 
Character, the supreme end of all home training and 
all school work, is but another name for adit, — habit 
that possesses the very fibér of body and 
mind. As we sow habits in muscle and nerve 
and brain, so shall we, and those who come after us, 
reap in aptitude, in skill, in character. Character.

     INTELLECT: PRESENTATIVE FACULTIES. 67 
CHAPTER VI. 
THE INTELLECT: PRESENTATIVE FACULTIES. 
THE first group of faculties of the mind, according 
to the classification given in Chapter II., is called the 
intellect. The intellect is the general power or collective 
powers of the mind by which it gains and 
classifies knowledge. This power or group 
of powers lies wholly within, is purely subjective; but 
it is capable of being quickened and energized and de 
veloped only by means of impressions received through 
the sensorium, which alone serves as the means of bring- 
ing to the mind sensations caused by objects of the 
material world around us. Stated in another way, the 
mind is dependent, for all primary knowledge, upon 
the sense avenues between it and the outside world. 
If there could come into existence a being without any 
of the sense organs, lacking sight and touch and hear- 
ing, and could live, it would be a mere thing, a lump of 
matter, however potential the germ of mind might be. 
The soul would be sealed within an impenetrable wall. 
The senses, considered only as physiological organs, 
can give nothing to the mind; for the sense organs of 
many idiots and the lower animals are as well developed 
and are as physiologically perfect as those of the culti- 
vated scholar. The senses can only send in to the brain 
certain impressions made upon them; and it depends 
upon the something within the brain, called mind, what Definition,

knowledge shall be made out of these impressions, or 
the molecular disturbances which they set up in the 
central ganglia. 
The senses are called collectively the objective pre- 
sentative faculties, because through them objective 
The Senses iMpressions are presented to consciousness. 
Objective. The special function of the senses is sensa- 
tion, a responding to any external stimulus that affects 
nerve tissue. The corresponding function of mind in 
referring these sensations to their external causes is 
perception. Sensation and perception taken together 
may be called observation. 
A full discussion of the function of the senses as 
such would lie mainly in the domain of physiology, 
and therefore largely outside the domain of psychology. 
In this chapter the psychological values of the senses 
will be considered. 
Touch may be said to be the basic sense. It is the 
one out of which all the others have developed, in the 
ouch, ana Progress of life from lower to higher forms, 
Temperature and is the one through which the child gets 
Sense. his first impressions. Lower life forms, like 
the oyster, show sensitiveness to touch, to impressions 
upon the surface of the body; but most of these forms 
have no organs of sight, or hearing, or other senses, so 
distinct in the higher animals and in man, and the fully 
developed sense organs of man are merely modified 
organs of touch. There must be actual contact of 
something upon the proper surfaces of these organs 
before there can be sensation. Sapid substances must 
touch the tongue in order to be tasted; the particles 
thrown off by odoriferous bodies must touch the olfac- 
tory region of the nose before there can be a percep.
-P-A-G-E-69
INTELLECT: PRESENTATIVE FACULTIES. 69 
tion of smell; light-vibrations must beat upon the 
proper surface in the eye before there can be sight. 
Many of the impressions which seem to come through 
the other senses are found, upon close inspection, to be 
derived from the sense of touch, or some of its imme- 
diate modifications. The term touch has been extended 
to include the sensations of temperature and pressure, 
or resistance, as well as those of “common feeling” 
derived from the body as a whole. It is considered 
safe to say that the temperature sense and the muscular 
sense are distinct from that of touch proper. 
Touch may be defined as the sense through which we 
gain percepts of surface and texture. By touch we de- 
termine the smoothness or roughness of sur- ‘ se Touch, and faces, and acquire such concepts as si/kiness, temperature 
velvety feel, coarseness, of fiber, etc. The tem- eee: 
perature sense is the sense through which we ; 
gain the percepts of heat and cold. It has been found 
that there are areas upon the skin which are sensitive 
only to heat, others that are sensitive only to cold. 
The muscular sense is the sense by which we wuscutar 
perceive pressure or resistance to muscular Sense. 
action. This sense also enables us to determine shape, 
size,and weight. 
The distinction between these three senses — all 
modified forms of the generic sense of touch — may be 
easily illustrated by a simple experiment. Take an 
apple in the hand, and pass the fingers and the palm 
lightly over the surface. From this light contact you 
perceive the surface to be smooth and cool. By slightly 
tightening the grasp as you pass the hand round the 
apple, you determine its spherical shape, its size, and 
degree of hardness. By balancing the apple in the
-P-A-G-E-70
70 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
upturned palm, you judge its weight from your percep. 
tion of resistance to muscular effort. In like manner 
are acquired percepts of the surface quality, texture, 
temperature, size, shape, weight, and density of any 
object handled. A little reflection will show that these 
are what might well be called the fundamental percepts 
of existence. From them we derive our concepts of 
motion, of extension, of solidity,—in short, the con- 
cept of matter itself. 
An interesting speculative question is suggested here: 
Would it be possible for us to get any idea of extension 
if we were merely a point of consciousness ? 
We could dispense with every other sense if we might 
retain these three, for through these there would be 
sufficient action and reaction of mind and the external 
world upon each other to enable us to live intelligent 
and happy lives. The marvelous history of Laura 
Bridgman’s life is too well known to make it necessary 
to do more than refer to it in support of the proposi- 
tion just made. The still more marvelous history of 
Helen Keller is also conclusive. 
It is a question not yet fully decided whether we 
can gain primarily through sight any other percepts 
than those of color, light, and shade; but there 
are excellent reasons, based on thorough ex- 
perimentation, for believing that through sight may 
also be gained primarily the percept of distance. 
Through sight, after it has been taught, corrected and 
directed by touch, and motion of the muscles, includ- 
ing those of the eye itself, we gain ideas of size, shape, 
weight, texture, and kind of material. The visual per- 
cept of an object we have once handled and tasted 
and smelled, recalls the percepts gained through the Sight.
-P-A-G-E-71
  INTELLECT: PRESENTATIVE FACULTIES. 71 
hand, the tongue, the nose; and we are again conscious 
of the size, shape, taste, etc., of the object looked at. 
Through the sense of hearing we gain per- 
cepts of sound, of pitch, loudness, and 
musical time. We can also, through the ear, judge of 
distance and direction. 
The percepts of taste are complexes made up of sen- 
sations gained through the tongue and the nose. We 
would lose the characteristic flavor of many 
substances, especially of those that are aro- 
matic, were it not for the help the tongue gets from the 
nose. This fact is shown in the loss or dulling of taste 
percepts while the nose is affected by a cold or catarrh. 
The simple experiment of tightly pressing the nostrils 
shut with the finger and thumb, and trying to taste 
spices, will illustrate the same thing. 
The different varieties of taste may be classed under 
four heads, —sweet, bitter, salt, and sour. To these are 
sometimes added the alkaline and metallic. The tip 
of the tongue is most sensitive to sour and sweet ; the 
root, to bitter and alkaline. No substance can. be 
tasted unless it is more or less soluble. 
The nerves of sme// are distributed in the mucous 
lining of the upper part of the nasal passages. Very 
little is known about the origin of odors, or 
how they affect the olfactory nerves. So far 
as smells are subject to classification, they fall approxi- 
mately into the same classes as tastes. 
All the senses have both a practical and an esthetic 
value. They furnish us with the materials General 
for practical knowledge, out of which the Functions : * and Values mind builds concepts, and formulates the ofthe 
experience that enables us to maintain exist- Senses. Hearing.

-P-A-G-E-72
  72 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
ence in safety and comfort; and they supply the mind 
also with the elements of the feelings of beauty, deli- 
cacy, and refinement. As has been shown, the sense of 
touch, with its immediate modifications, is the sense 
through which comes our most valuable knowledge of 
the outside world. The visuad sense ranks high in both 
values, the practical and the esthetic, but is preémi- 
nently the minister of the esthetic feeling. Next to 
the eye ranks the ear, in both values. 
If a man should suddenly lose the sense of touch, 
with the muscular sense and that of temperature, he 
could not live long. He would be unaware of cuts, 
blows, burns, or other accidents, unless he happened to 
seethem. So in the highest degree, touch and its modi- 
fications are protective. Taste and smell are also pro- 
tective senses, both standing guard over what passes 
into stomach or lungs. Taste and smell also directly 
assist digestion, food which smells good and tastes good 
being more readily digested than that which is insipid . 
and inodorous. 
The expression education of the senses means, of 
course, the training of the mind to the proper use and

Senses. car, or tongue, or brain, that sees, or hears, 
or tastes. The mind will see only what it is capable of 
seeing, however much more there may be to see, and 
however ready the eye and nerve fiber and brain may 
be to do their own work. The artist or the poet, or 
any one of cultivated mind, will see infinitely more in 
the blending of colors of earth and sky than can the 
untrained plowboy to whom the most splendid sunset 
means no more than an indication of the time to stop

work. The near-sighted botanist, peering among the 
roadside plants, will see what his dog at his side cannot 
see, though the eyes of the dog are better than the man’s. 
No power of mind or body is given us which it is not 
our duty to cultivate and train to right functioning. 
All the senses should receive proper education, in both 
their practical and esthetic service. Even those senses 
that are usually supposed to have least prac- 
tical or esthetic value, as smell and taste, re ares 
should have a full share of attention. As ‘tivated. 
has been said, they are guardian senses, and in propor- 
tion as they are trained to distinguish between helpful 
and hurtful substances will they be able to prevent the 
entrance of bad food and bad water into the stomach, 
and of bad air into the lungs. There can be no doubt 
that typhoid fever, diphtheria, and enteric troubles 
would be far less common if foul odors and evil tastes 
fell upon trained olfactories and palates instead of upon 
heedless ones. It is more than possible that we might 
have better bodies and sounder digestions if those who 
preside over the destinies of our kitchens had trained 
and discriminating noses and tongues. Smell is also 
capable of giving great zsthetic delight. In all ages 
the use of delicate perfumes has been an indication of 
refinement. 
It is easy and pleasant to have in school an occa- 
sional exercise in “telling by the smell and taste.” In 
the season of fruits and flowers, the children can bring 
apples, pears, grapes, roses, violets, and similar articles, 
to school, and take turns in identifying them by tast- 
ing or smelling wth the eyes shut. 
The chief means of training the ear is, of course, 
music. Unfortunately, so many teachers know so little
-P-A-G-E-74
14 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
of this themselves, that they cannot use it successfully. 
It is to be hoped that it will not be so very long until 
every public school will have its piano, and the public 
school teacher will be fitted to use it in cultivating 
the love of song and the sense of melody in every pupil. 
Music is a powerful means of successful management of 
a school. 
But aside from music there are simple exercises which 
will serve the twofold purpose of training the ear and 
testing it. Blindfold a pupil, and have him judge from

Training. slight noise comes, and by what it is pro- 
duced. The ticking of a watch, the tapping of a bell, 
the snapping of the fingers, are among the many simple 
sounds that can be used in such experiments. The 
results of these exercises may reveal to the teacher seri- 
ous defects of hearing in some children, and indicate 
why these pupils have seemed dull and indifferent. 
It will be found an excellent plan, too, to direct the 
attention of the pupils to the many different sounds in 
nature, — the chirp of the cricket, the hum of the bee, 
the song of birds, all the multitudinous music of animate 
wood and field, — and train them to note the differences 
of loudness and pitch in these sounds. The heart as 
well as the hearing can be cultivated in this way; for if 
the boy can be got to prefer listening to a bird to throw- 
ing at it, his humanizing has had a fair beginning. By 
setting the pupil to attending with his ears, he may be 
led to attend with other senses, and grow into a deep 
and reverential appreciation of nature. 
The visual sense should receive its training together 
with, and to a large extent by means of, the training of 
the other senses. Especially should eye and hand be
-P-A-G-E-75
INTELLECT: PRESENTATIVE FACULTIES. 75 
trained together. The usual school exercise for this is 
drawing, and drill in drawing may be given by a teacher 
who cannot himself draw. It is far better that the child 
should be given paper and pencil, and be permitted 
to practice in his own fashion the drawing of simple 
objects, than that eye and hand should get none of 
this training. 
But there are other ways of developing the power to 
see, and the. power to perceive through skin and muscle. 
Objects of different materials, sizes, shapes, weights, and 
textures, can easily be provided in any school, 
and the children will welcome opportunities Meee 
to distinguish these by handling and seeing Skin, and 
them. Drillsin estimating distance, size,and *¥** 
weight, through touch and sight, will be greatly enjoyed. 
In every case, estimated distances, weights, and dimen- 
sions should be verified by exact measuring and weigh- 
ing. A common laboratory experiment in psychology, 
which may easily be imitated in any school, is to use 
small bits of cork, of known weight, in determining sen- 
sitiveness to pressure. By placing these weights, one at 
a time, upon different parts of the hands or face of the 
same pupil and upon different pupils, it will be found 
that some parts of the body and some pupils are much 
more sensitive to pressure than others. ‘ 
An excellent eye test is to draw a line upon the black- 
board, and have the pupils, in turn, put a dot at what 
they believe to be its middle point ; or have them draw 
on another board a line which they judge to be of the

mentioned which test the area, or rather sphere, of con- 
scious vision. While a pupil is looking fixedly at some 
point in direct line with his eyes, the teacher or another

pupil may place objects anywhere within the hemisphere 
in front of him, and the readiness with which he identi- 
fies these objects without turning his eyes will show his 
range of vision. Place a number of familiar small objects 
not too close together ona table or desk, and cover them 
with a cloth. When ready for the test, jerk the cloth 
away, and let the pupils look at the objects (which they 
must not have seen there before) for two seconds, or 
less time; then cover the objects again, and have each 
pupil tell what ones and how many he saw. With dif- 
ferent colored cardboards or bits of paper, the teacher 
may also test his pupils for color blindness. 
All these exercises should be almost wholly in the 
nature of play rather than routine work ; but the teacher

These records may include the age, sex, social rank, 
health, and general advancement of the pupils; for 
while such items are not of direct value to the teacher, 
still they are interesting, and are of value to the soci- 
ologist. From such tests and records the discerning 
teacher will be able to draw valuable conclusions regard- 
ing special aptitudes or special defects of his pupils. 
These combined tests and training drills should be sup- 
plemented with general observation work of every kind. 
The eye should be trained to take quick and accurate 
note of everything that comes within its view, — objects 
and changes in nature; pictures, buildings, machinery, — 
in short, everything, since everything may be made to 
furnish knowledge-material. 
It is to be devoutly hoped that the beginnings in 
sense cultivation which are being made everywhere 
will soon grow into a full share of the time which has

heretofore been spent in word cramming: Teachers of 
children have been criminally neglectful of those broad 
and open highways to the child’s mind, his senses, and 
have tried to substitute word cramming for sense 
training. 
There is another faculty which can properly be called 
presentative, since it presents knowledge to conscious. 
ness. This is 2#¢aztion, classed in Chapter II. 
as the subjective presentative faculty. The 
term intuztion has been used in various senses, of 
which it is necessary to note only that most generally 
accepted. It is used, like many other names in psy- 
chology, to designate both a faculty and a product. 
Asa faculty, it may be defined as the power by which 
we know without proof. As a product, an intuition is 
a primary concept occasioned by, but not formed from, 
sense perceptions. Our intuitions are concepts of being, 
space, time, and cause. To these have been added by 
some writers the concepts of beauty, goodness, truth, 
and God. We are said to zztuit (that is, to know with- 
out proof) the separate existence of matter and self, — 
the existence of matter as being in space; the existence 
of self and the occurrence of events, in time; that all 
things are caused; and that like causes produce like 
effects. These concepts are called necessary truths. The 
mind must believe and accept them as soon as they are 
presented, in order to save all other knowledge from 
chaotic confusion. 
There are two theories regarding intuition, which 
have been more or less wordily set forth by those who 
have held the one or the other. One is that theories of 
intuition is an zunate power of the mind, a dis- Intuition. 
tinct activity, like the memory or the will; and that its Intuition.
-P-A-G-E-78
78 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
function isto form certain concepts as soon as the mind 
has reached the right stage of development. The other 
explains our intuitions, not as the results of the work 
of any special innate faculty, but as the experiences of 
the individual or of the race. According to this view, 
each individual, in the development of the human race, 
has discovered certain relations of things, has acted upon 
and lived according to these relations, and has trans- 
mitted the knowledge of them to his offspring, who in 
their turn have added to this knowledge similar expe- 
riences of their own ;.and so on, until the accumulated 
experience becomes zntuztion. 
Without going further into a discussion of the diffi- 
culties met with in any. attempt to explain intuition, it 
is enough to say that we do have consciousness of time, 
space, and cause, and these concepts are necessary to 
our intelligent and confident use and enjoyment of our 
environment. The presentations of intuition are as uni- 
versal and as reliable as the presentations of sense. To 
cultivate the senses alone and neglect or decry intuition 
is to end in a blind materialism. To cultivate both 
objective and subjective sense is to grow from the lower 
to the higher life.

CHAPTER VII. 
THE INTELLECT: THE REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY. 
No real knowledge would be possible if percept 
followed percept day after day, without leaving any 
permanent record, and if what is in consciousness now 
could not come into consciousness again. The senses 
might make presentation after presentation without any 
resulting growth of mind, if the different percepts could 
not be represented to consciousness. The power which 
the mind has to reproduce its own former 
states is called memory. Imagination is usu- 
ally described as a representative faculty coordinate with 
memory, but a little analysis will show that what is thus 
miscalled imagination is simply memory recalling zmages 
which have been in consciousness. Imagination is the 
creative faculty, and will be discussed as such later. 
The functions of memory are to retain and Functions of 
to reproduce. By some psychologists a third Memory. 
function is given it, that of recognizing or reknowing 
the thing remembered. 
It is open to question whether it is memory or con- 
sciousness that recognizes (reknows) past mental states. 
Ladd makes recognition an essential function of mem- 
ory, and says there is no real memory of past states of 
mind unless recognition takes place. But quite fre- 
quently some thought, or phrase, or image, will come 
into the mind, which we believe to be new, but which Definition.

we later accidentally identify as one we had had before. 
Memory, in such cases, retains and reproduces, but recog- 
nition does not take place. It seems possible, then, to 
retain ideas which will not be recognized at all, unless 
under some unusual stimulus. 
There is excellent ground for believing that every- 
thing that makes even a very slight impression upon 
Nothing. fs consciousness is faithfully retained. It is a 
wholly peculiar fact that strong impressions made 
forgotten. upon the muscles, nerves, or brain, persist for 
some time after they are made. For instance, if we look 
steadily at a bright window for a few minutes and then 
close the eyes, we can still see the window, not as we did 
with the eyes open, but as if it were a picture printed on 
something within the eye. A boy who has plowed all 
day will, if unaccustomed to such work, “ plow all night.” 
He not only dreams of plowing, but his muscles actu- 
ally work. In the delirium of fever, the decay of old 
age, organic brain disease, or imminent danger of violent 
death, as by drowning, countless apparently wholly for- 
gotton scenes and thoughts and experiences of long- 
gone years come into consciousness again. Old people 
readily recall what took place in their childhood; to the 
drowning man his past life unrolls like a scroll ; an igno- 
rant servant has been known to recite, in the delirium of 
her fatal illness, passage after passage of Hebrew which 
she had heard her master read years before. It is note- 
worthy, that, as people grow older under normal condi- 
tions, they are apt to return more and more to the ways 
of doing and living, to the habits and opinions, of their 
earlier years. 
Attempts have been made to explain physiologically 
how memory does its work, by supposing that every
-P-A-G-E-81
  
INTELLECT: REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY. 81 
mental state, every feeling, every act of will, makes an 
impression on the brain cells, or is accompanied by, or 
is caused by, some change in these cells, and that these 
impressions or changes are in some way made sh ysiological permanent. Then when the blood is made rExptanation

strongly than usual, as by an effort of the will in try- 
ing to. remember, the mental states corresponding to 
the cell changes again appear in consciousness. It will 
readily be seen that the explanation needs explaining. 
But the physical basis of memory is more readily dis- 
cernible than that of any of our other faculties except 
the presentative. There is, for instance, a real muscle 
memory. A swimmer never forgets the swimming 
stroke, even though he may not use it for years. One 
who has been a:skillful operator on a writing machine 
will automatically fall into the right fingering of the 
familiar keyboard, though he may not have touched a 
machine in months. 
Memory, as -regards its relation to will, is of two 
kinds, — involuntary or spontaneous, and voluntary. 
Involuntary memory is called remembrance;  xinds of 
voluntary, recollection. Remembrance is a Memory. 
part of the “mental current” that flows unceasingly 
through our waking, and much of our sleeping, con- 
sciousness. On this mental stream are carried bits of 
song, familiar sayings, fragments of conversations, pic- 
tures of places, suggestions to do this or that, —every 
rag and tag of former mental states, mixed with the 
sense impressions and thoughts that are all .,. steam

of remembrance will often, in spite of every °*"°* 
effort at prevention, sweep attention aside, and fill

and overflow consciousness. There are, two kinds of 
“drift” upon its surface that are worth looking out 
for: one is made up of images, ideas, suggestions that 
may prove valuable in starting trains of connected 
thought; the other is made up of ridiculous or evil 
suggestions, sometimes almost seeming to be made by 
some one or some thing within us. Out of the first 
kind of drift we may get the key to a difficult solution, 
an apt quotation, or a subject or a thought for an 
" essay, —numberless “good ideas.” Out of the second 
come often many of our severest temptations. The 
tide of remembrance is in constant flow, except perhaps 
at times of the most intense concentration of mind, 
and ebbs and rises according to the varying power to 
fix attention upon some certain object of thought. 
One who gives himself up to remembrance is an idle 
dreamer, spending his time in reverie and air-castle 
building; and some unfortunate circumstance may at 
any time cause his fancies so to possess his conscious- 
ness that he will cross the line between sanity and 
insanity. 
Voluntary memory, or recollection, is the faculty act- 
ing under control and direction of the will. We may 
Recollec. desire to recall some part of our accumulated 
tion. knowledge. An effort of the will is made to 
bring the fact wanted back into consciousness, and soon 
it is re-presented to us, often apparently coming of itself, 
oftener /ed by related ideas. One of the oddities of 
memory is the queer feeling of loss— of mental “ gone- 
ness’’—we experience when a name, or date, or fact, 
which we were just now conscious of, slips out of the 
mind. By steadily focusing attention upon the place 
where the idea was, we can usually bring it back.
-P-A-G-E-83
INTELLECT: REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY. 83 
Generally the recall must be effected through associa- 
tion, that is, running the mind over ideas connected in 
some way with the particular one desired, until we find 
what is wanted, as when we say over the alphabet to 
find a name. At other times memory brings up ideas 
faster than we can use them. In such a case, as in 
writing an essay or making an extemporanéous speech, 
we can keep a number of ideas waiting in the anteroom 
of consciousness until we invite them to enter and be 
of service. A rapid speaker or writer must have many 
ideas in sight besides those he is expressing. Some- 
times memory degivs work under volitional direction, 
but seems to continue it automatically. This is illus- 
trated in the case of'a good platform speaker. He fixes 
his attention upon the line of thought he wants to 
present to his audience, and memory immediately be- 
gins to supply words for speech, and continues to do so 
without conscious effort. Indeed, even the thoughts 
themselves seem often to come automatically, after a 
beginning is made. 
Memory may be further described as verbal and 
logicak Verbal memory has especial facility in retain- 
ing and reproducing words and their com-  verbat 
binations. One with a strong verbal memory Memory. 
will readily commit and reproduce the exact words of 
a definition or rule, of a poem, or a passage in history. 
For such a person it is easier to memorize than to un- 
derstand, and memory will be made to do the work of 
the thinking faculty. A logical memory finds it diffi- 
cult to hold the exact language in which a Logicat 
thought is expressed, but readily retains and Memory. 
recalls the thought itself. A pupil with a good logical 
memory must understand what he studies in order to

remember it, and prefers to recite the substance of a 
passage in his own language. There is no reason, ap- 
parently, why it should be true, but it is true often, 
that a strong verbal. memory is found in pea very 
weak in the other faculties. 
Different persons are endowed with memories that 
vary in many other ways than those mentioned in the 
preceding paragraphs. One person has an excellent 
memory for cay impressions; another can more readily 
retain and recall what he gains through the eye. One 
person will remember arithmetic well, but cannot learn 
a Latin declension; another can commit history with 
little difficulty, while he has great trouble in remem- 
bering the generalizations of science. Wide variations 
of memory are, however, comparatively rare; and it 
may safely be said that one who has a good memory 
for one class of facts can remember any other kind 
_ equally well, if he will only set himself to do so. An 
“all round” memory, one that will hold and readily 
reproduce everything committed to it,— sense impres- 
sions, words, facts, thoughts, — is greatly to be desired ; 
and no effort should be spared to make what memory 
we have as effective as possible. It should be assidu- 
ously trained, both to verbal exactness and to logical 
association of thoughts. 
A system of memory training is called mnemonics. 
There are various such systems of cultivating the 
memory, some of them old, some new; many 
of them artificial and cumbersome, wrong in 
principle, and failures in use; a few correct in theory, 
and more or less successful in practice. All that have 
been found in any degree helpful are based upon some 
or all of the daws of memory. These laws may be Mnemonics.
-P-A-G-E-85
\ 
INTELLECT: REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY. 85 
named as follows: (1) the law of mse; (2) the law of 
interest ; (3) the law of attention; (4) the law of repe- 
tition ; (5) the laws of association, of which there are 
several. : 
Memory, like every other faculty, of either mind or 
body, is developed by using it. The law of use runs 
through all nature. Powell says the body | Lawor 
is, in all its organs, the result of work. All Use 
through nature it is true that failure to use means 
degeneracy. If an organ ceases to function actively, it 
becomes useless. Some of the religious devotees of 
India hold an arm in a certain position without using 
it, until it becomes shriveled and fixed, so that it is no 
longer obedient to will. Through lack of proper exer- 
cise, memory often becomes weak and unreliable. The 
one sure way to strengthen a muscle or memory is to use 
it. A notebook is a dangerous and unruly servant. 
An analysis of the numerous widely advertised sys- 
tems of memory training will show that they agree in 
two essentials,—the necessity of putting something 
into the memory as a basis to start from; and the asso- 
ciation with this of the things to be remembered. The 
best brief direction for properly training the memory 
is, use tt according to the laws of association. 
In the.case of memory, as of everything else, zzterest is 
the best spur to use. We more actively and effectively 
use the memory ip the acquisition of those Law of 
things in which we are most interested. In terest. 
other words, we remember what interests us. But mere 
superficial interest is rather detrimental than otherwise 
to good retention; for a wandering curiosity, flitting 
here and there, distracts attention, and the mind does 
not dwell long enough upon any one thing to get it  
-P-A-G-E-86
86 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
fixed in memory. This fact is often amusingly illus- 
trated by the evident distraction of sightseers, who, 
driven by a greedy curiosity from point to point of some 
great exposition or of some strange city, are unable to 
fix any valuable acquisition in mind, and cannot after- 
ward give any connected account of what they have seen. 
The law of attention, briefly stated, is, We remember 
what we give careful attention to. It was noted ina 
Lawof preceding chapter that the best attention is 
Attention. that which is due to interest; so the laws of 
interest and attention, as regards memory training, are 
very closely connected. What is committed tomemory 
by forced attention is very poorly retained. Every one 
has had the annoying experience of trying to read an 
uninteresting book, or to read something while the 
mind was occupied with other matters. Under such 
circumstances, a paragraph or sentence may ~-be read 
and reread, without its making any permanent impres- 
sion upon consciousness. The mind’s retention is 
directly proportioned to its attention. 
Frequent conscious repetition of anything tends to 
fix itin memory. By persistent repetition of effort we 
Lawof learn to write, to row, to sew, to do anything 
Repetition. requiring manual dexterity. We fix the 
multiplication table and other such matters in mind by 
constant repetition. But mere perfunctory repetition 
rather serves to prevent than to aid retentive acquisition. 
.There seems to be a limit beyond which repetition is of 
no service in memorizing. The mere conning overa 
lesson, without interest or real attention, seems to make 
it more difficult to learn. The teacher should always 
be careful to introduce variety into his repetitions, in 
drill or review, and thus keep interest awake.
-P-A-G-E-87
  
INTELLECT: REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY. 87 
The element of ¢zme enters into acquisition by repeti- 
tion. Alesson is more readily and thoroughly learned 
if it is laid aside after it has been gone over once or 
twice thoroughly, and then is taken up again some hours 
later, than if the same time is put upon it consecutively. 
Association of ideas serves to name very aptly a 
mental phenomenon which is, like all other mental 
phenomena, in no wise explained by merely Laws of 
naming it. By this phrase is meant the Association. 
grouping-together of impressions and ideas, so that 
when one member of a group comes into consciousness, 
the others of that group will also be remembered. The 
process by which these associated ideas follow one 
another into consciousness is called suggestion. We say, 
“That remark reminds me of [suggests] something I 
heard the other day.” We are often wont to verify a 
date or an event, not by reference to a calendar, but by 
recalling some other occurrence, perhaps quite trivial, 
with which the first is associated in some way. We may, 
for instance, recollect that a certain important telegram 
which we received years ago, réached us on Sunday, be- 
cause we remember hearing the ringing of the, , | Bape: 
church bells while reading the message. In ment in 
conversation with a friend, some chance word A**°ciation- 
may start a train of associated ideas that come trooping 
through consciousness during a brief lull in the talk, 
and the next thought uttered may therefore be appar- 
ently totally disconnected with the previous remarks, 
although the association in the mind of the speaker may 
be very close and coherent. There is no more interest- 
ing psychological pastime than to start a conversation 
with a friend, and, after making note of the first remark, 
let the talk drift naturally and spontaneously for a  
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
quarter of an hour, noting the remark made at the close 
of that time. Then try to trace back the conversation, 
and see along what line of association the mind traveled 
from the first to the last remark. The suggestion of 
ideas is also illustrated by the way in which uneducated 
people often go into unimportant details in narrating 
some occurrence. All the details are closely associated 
in their minds, and, in the absence of a trained power 
to select and combine, all are given equal prominence. 
Various names have been given the laws of associa- 
tion. The following are, perhaps, sufficiently exact: 
(1) law of contiguity in time and place ; (2) law of sémz- 
larity ; (3) law of sign and thing signified ; (4) law of 
cause and effect. 
We easily associate events that happened at the 
same time or in closely consecutive times, even when 
Law of they occurred in widely separated places ; 
Contiguity. we also associate events that have occurred 
in the same place or in contiguous places, though per- 
haps at widely different times. Many most valuable 
associations are made between events occurring together 
or contiguously in both time and place. We associate 
the Columbian Exposition with the great railway riots 
of 1894, because they were both at Chicago, though at 
different times. This is association through identity or 
contiguity of place. We often find it helpful to learn 
United States history by “administrations,” because 
the events that occurred during a given administration 
are grouped together in ¢zme. 
The element of ¢zme is essential to most association 
in place; it is necessary, for instance, that we should 
not merely remember that Chicago was the place in 
which occurred both the Columbian Exposition and
-P-A-G-E-89
    \ a 
INTELLECT : REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY. 89 
the railway strike, but we must also remember which 
occurred first. So in learning a new road or the streets 
of a strange city, we not only associate thé prominent 
objects that serve as-landmarks, by their proximity in 
place, but also by the order in which we passed them 
in time. 
We associate things that are sémilar. The spelling. 
book writers have abundantly availed themselves of 
this law, in giving lists of words of similar Law of 
sound, similar form, and similar meaning, Similarity. 
The various jingles given in some Latin grammars, by 
which the learner may the more_readily learn a list of 
prepositions or some rule of syntax, are also based upon 
the law of similarity. Alliteration and rhyme aid in 
the memorizing of poetry. Things producing like effects 
or produced by like causes are readily associated. “Al- 
though some psychologists name association by contrast 
also, yet it is questionable whether the mind spontane- 
ously associates sharply contrasting ideas. Ugliness can 
hardly be said to suggest beauty, or a very tall building 
to suggest a hut. 
Association of sign and thing Sante is illustrated in 
the association of things with their xames, of words and 
symbols with their corresponding odjects or : ‘ Law of ideas. The importance of this form of asso- sign ana 
ciation will be perceived at once, especially its Thing i : signified. value to the teacher. It is fundamental to 
all learning. The spoken word must suggest promptly 
and clearly the idea for which it stands, and also the 
written form of the word. A letter with its diacritical 
mark must suggest the correct sound to be uttered. 
The signs —, +, +, etc., and their spoken names, must 
instantly suggest the corresponding mathematical’ op-

erations. The rapid and accurate work of expert teleg- 
raphers and members of army and navy signal corps 
is due to the rapidity with which the sign suggests the 
thing signified. 
The time taken for an impulse to evel from the eye, 
or ear, or the organs of touch, to the brain, and for the 
corresponding outgoing impulse to produce its proper 
effect in some muscle, is called reaction time. For ex- 
ample, the time elapsing, when all conditions are most 
favorable, between seeing the sign + and reading it plus, 
is reaction time, — the time consumed by the reaction 
of the sign, through consciousness, upon the muscles 
used in uttering the word. At first thought it might 
be supposed that this time is too short to be measured ; 
but it has been pretty accurately determined in the 
laboratory, and found to average between one tenth 
and two tenths of a second.

is instinctively asked, What isits use? The child clamors 
to know “ what is that for,” upon being shown a new 
object. We more readily remember what and where 
the “ date line” is, if we know the reasons of its being 
established. The names of the muscles are much easier 
to learn if with the names we learn the uses. The 
motorman on a street car can do his work more intelli- 
gently, and therefore better, if he knows all the effects 
produced by the different movements of his lever.

Attempts have been made to reduce the laws of asso- 
ciation to one, or at most two. Ladd includes them all 
under the law of contiguity, or nearness, by which all 
ideas that are formed at the same time or consecutive 
times are associated, and one suggests the ae 
others. But analysis of any simple act of  tictusive 
memory will show that there must be a 7ve/a- Law of : : : Relation. tion of some kind between ideas, té cause 
their association ; and it is equally clear that the rela. 
tion of contiguity is not the only relation by which 
association is effected. It therefore seems better to 
try to reduce all the laws of association to the one daw 
of relation. No fact of consciousness is of any value 
or of any interest except as it is related to other facts. 
Relativity is the bond or mexus that binds all our knowl- 
edge into a coherent unity. Then, too, under the law 
of relation can be brought several forms of association 
that cannot be easily named in any other way, or shown 
to come logically under the laws of association usually 
given. Renamed in terms of relation, the laws of asso- 
ciation would be (1) relation of nearness in time and 
space; (2) relation of resemblance; (3) relation of sign 
and thing signified; (4) relation of cause and effect. 
The relativity of two or more things serves as a kind 
of peg on which to hang them in the memory. Knowl- 
edge of the inner relations between principles, rules, 
formulz, and processes, in arithmetic and algebra, is 
the only knowledge that is of any real value in a mem- 
orized rule. History can be remembered in’ any way 
worth while, only by perceiving the relations between 
its important events and the subordinate events leading 
up to them. A diagram or outline, a written solution, 
a figure in mensuration, are helpful only in proportion
-P-A-G-E-92

to the accuracy with which they can be made to show 
real relations. . 
It is only classified knowledge—that is, knowledge 
placed in its real relations—that can be most effectively 
retained and reproduced for use. Unclassi- 
eaeeicicd fied knowledge is almost useless. Some 
the only minds seem to be mere junk shops of knowl- 
Reese edge, filled with scraps and fragments of 
learning, tumbled together as they -came, 
with no orderliness or method in their arrangement. 
Others are like a well-arranged, well-kept museum, 
where everything is properly named and classified, and 
where everything can be got at without delay and with 
small effort. 
The law of relation may also be called the law of 
understanding, for understanding a thing is knowing it 
in its relations to other things. A thorough under- 
standing of a process, or a method, or the meaning of 
a passage, greatly aids the retention of it.

which it was seen, or heard, or smelled before, and calls 
up the feelings of pleasure or pain which formed part

bring most vividly back to our consciousness pleasura-

cient to bring back long-gone days,.with their burdens 
of joy or sorrow, and make us live them over again, 
whether we will or no. It is related that a locomotive 
engineer who had very narrowly escaped a terrible acci- 
dent at a certain place on his run, was utterly unable 
to command himself-or his engine afterwards, at that 
particular point, though he was one of the road’s most 
reliable men at other times and places. 
Sight, hearing, and smell seem to furnish the most 
vivid associational impressions; and taste and touch, 
the least vivid. 
APPLICATIONS TO TEACHING. 
Were it not for memory, there could be no yesterday. 
The representative faculty binds into continuity the ex- 
periences of life, and gives substance and body to the 
- consciousness of se/f and self’s ever-changing sameness. 
Our efforts to acquire knowledge are effective in pro- 
portion to our power to retain, reproduce, and recognize 
what we have once learned. 
All this simply emphasizes the strenuous necessity of 
developing the memory, of making it retentive, prompt, 
accurate. The teacher must plan exercises suited to 
the different kinds of memory, verbal and logical, and 
must conduct recitations according to the different laws 
of memory. He must not forget that different studies 
have different values in developing memory according 
to these laws; and he should assign the work, and have

it done, in each branch studied, so that it shall best 
produce the effect it is specially adapted to bring about. 
To make specific application of these general direc- 
tions, some suggestions are here given. 
The verbal memory may be cultivated by requiring 
choice bits of literature within the comprehension of 
specific the learner to be memorized and recited prop- 
Suggestions. erly, by having dialogues and declamations as 
frequent exercises, and by making verbatim reports of 
important news items an occasional feature of school 
work. The necessity for promptitude and absolute ex- 
actness of memory in such work must not be forgotten. 
There must be no slurring on words, no peeping in the 
books, no “starting” with the “first word” or “first 
letter.” 
It is not advisable to insist upon verbatim recitations 
of regular lessons, for to uaderstand is more important 
than to remember the words used. Indeed, the best evi- 
dence a teacher can have that a pupil does not understand 
a lesson, is that it is recited in the exact language of the 
book. A pupil should rarely, if ever, be permitted to 
recite a lesson verbatim, as the text-book gives it. 
To cultivate the logical memory, exercises should 
be given in the why and how of things, outside the 
books as well as in them. Each faculty of the mind 
helps the others; and to cultivate the power to discern 
relations (the judgment) develops the logical memory. 
The teacher should let no opportunity slip of asking 
why this was done, or how that was obtained, in arith- 
metic; of having the pupils trace the connections and 
causes of events in history and civics; of stimulating 
them to look up for themselves the etymologies of 
words met with in their reading.
-P-A-G-E-95
  INTELLECT: REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY. 95 
Anything that strengthens the association of ideas 
increases their chances of being retained. The more 
associational hooks an idea has, the better its chance of 
hanging in the memory. Impressions gained through 
eye, ear, and hand, should be associated. A word should 
be seen, pronounced, and written. An object should be 
seen, handled, and drawn. There should be many 
written lessons, much drawing, and more or less fre- 
quent manual exercises. ' 
Remembering that whatever stirnlates interest and 
fixes attention aids memory, the teacher should study 
different ways of putting things before his classes. 
The way in which a fact is stated or a question asked 
often fixes a thing in the memory, as a flash light prints 
an image on the photographic plate. 
The several branches should be so taught that.their 
different laws of association may have their full effect. 
The events of history and the facts of civics are to be 
associated in ¢¢me and by cause, concepts derived from 
map study, map drawing, and map molding, should be 
associated in place ; new words in reading must be asso- 
ciated with their proper pronunciation and meaning ; 
the organs of the body, as studied in physiology, will 
be remembered in association with their wses. 
It is a part of everyday experience that the memory 
drops many unimportant details, and retains only the 
more valuable facts. The teacher should ae 
therefore not present all facts to his pupils things 
with equal vividness, but should select the pee 
central ones, give them preéminence, and 
group the others around these. With a single impor- 
tant fact, many associated details can afterward be fished 
up out of the sea of subconsciousness. Give the mem-
-P-A-G-E-96
96 y PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
ory a firm and confident grasp of the main thing, and 
minor matters will largely take care of themselves. 
The body does not retain or assimilate all the food 
that goes into it; neither does the mind retain or assimi- 
late all the knowledge material that is put into it. But 
as, in order to secure good digestion, the food that goes 
into the stomach should have in it much material that 
cannot be assimilated, but which only serves to excite 
the muscular and secretory organs of digestion, so the 
facts that the mind acquires should have with’ them 
much illustrative material that shall quicken the mind’s 
retentive and assimilative action. 
Memory, like any other faculty, may be worked to 
the point of fatigue. To this point it should never be 
pushed in school or elsewherer The normal Memory oz j as maybe activity of memory may also be easily in- 
fatigued and hibited; and this is allowed for by every inhibited. 5 generous examiner, for he knows that’ what 
a pupil can readily and accurately recall ordinarily, he 
may lose utterly, for a time, under the inhibition of 
nervous fear of failure. Under the inhibiting influence 
of fear of threatened punishment, a child may hope- 
lessly forget the very thing he is striving hardest to 
remember. 
SUGGESTIONS TO THE TEACHER. 
(1) Train the judgment to select from the mass of 
material coming into consciousness those things that 
are worth remembering, and to establish. some logical 
connection between them and what has already been 
learned. 
(2) Having secured the interested attention of the 
class, repeat and re-repeat, and have the pupils repeat,
-P-A-G-E-97
INTELLECT: REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY. 97 
the central facts of the lesson, but each time in a 
different way. Set a fact in as many different lights 
as possible. It is only varied repetition that helps 
memory. : 
(3) Impress upon the pupils that one careful reading 
of a lesson is worth a dozen scurrying attempts to 
merely memorize the words. : 
(4) Following the law of repetition further, have 
frequent reviews, — review daily, weekly, monthly. 
(5), Try to show the kinship of all knowledge, and 
make sure that the pupils wzderstand what has been 
studied, and have linked to-day’s acquisitions with yes- 
terday’s. This can be done only by the most skillful 
questioning, for the average pupil is so human that 
he will do much to keep his ignorance hidden. 
(6) Make as many associations through the senses as 
possible. If an idea can go into the mind, or be made 
to arise in consciousness, through all the senses, it will 
be more readily remembered than if it is gained through 
only one or two. 
(7) The memory for auditory, visual, and muscular 
impressions, should be especially cultivated, for these 
are the most important. Ability to retain these, and 
to reproduce them promptly and correctly, lies at the 
core of skill; and without skill there can be no practical 
success in any undertaking.

CHAPTER VIII. 
THE INTELLECT: THE RELATIONAL FACULTY. 
THE natural movements of the mind are (1) to acguzre, 
(2) to retain, (3) to correlate. With the presentative 
faculties it acquires ; with the representative it retains 
and recalls ; with the judgment it correlates. 
Judgment, then, is the relational faculty, and may be 
defined in set terms as the faculty by which relations are 
perceived and formulated. It is the thinking 
faculty. Judgment has been variously called 
the elaborative faculty, the reflective faculty, the dis- 
criminative and assimilative faculty, the rational faculty. 
None of these names describes its essential function so 
well as the term relational. 
Judgment, intuition, and reason are synonyms, being 
simply different names for the same thing. If sucha 
distinction is admissible, we may say intuition is the 
most elementary form of judgment. Judgment is to 
some degree concerned in the most elementary acts of 
intellection. In gaining percepts, the mind must be 
aware of some connection or relation between the object 
which affects the senses and the mental state which is 
produced. The referring of resistance and color to an 
object is really an elementary act of judgment. 
The products, in order, of the relational faculty, are 
percepts, concepts, judgments, arguments. It is usually 
affirmed that percepts are gained zntuztively, that the Judgment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
  INTELLECT: RELATIONAL FACULTY. 99 
mind immediately receives, and trusts the messages sent 
intoit by thesenses. But if judgment and intuition are 
identical, as it is believed a close analysis will 
show them to be, the judgment is the faculty eis 
by which the impressions of sense are re- through 
ferred to the objects which produce them, rae 
and this is the essential act in forming a percept. 
As will be shown later, concepts are formed by the 
combination of like percepts, and detecting resemblance 
or likeness between percepts is also an act of judgment. 
As the mind develops, the perception of differences in- 
volved in the discrimination of objects is done by the 
judgment. This perception of differences serves to in- 
tensify the resemblances upon which our concepts are 
based. To have arrived at the concept dog, the judg- 
ment must have selected the’ points of resemblance 
between animals designated by the term dog, and have 
combined these resemblances into one group. Every 
time the differences are noted between dogs and other 
animals, the resemblances between dogs will become 
more evident. 
Judgment is a term used to name the product of the 
relational faculty as well as the faculty itself. A judg- 
ment, as a product, is the affirmation of some Tadgusene 
relation between two or more concepts, or defined asa 
between concepts and percepts; as when I Bess 
say, “The dog is an animal,” “The lion is carnivorous,” 
“It will rain to-night.” In these three propositions, 
relations are affirmed between the concepts dog and 
animal, lion and carnivorous, and between the percep- 
tion of the weather as it now is, and the previous con- 
cept I have formed of the conditions likely to produce 
rain.
-P-A-G-E-100
    
100 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
Argument is the combination of two or more judg: 
ments in order to reach some final judgment which is 
called a conclusion. It is the province of logic fully to 
discuss the combination of judgments. Some notice 
will be taken of it in Chapter XV. 
The work of judgment may be summarized as follows: 
Perceiving relation between a sense impression and 
Sree the object which produces it, is necessary in 
Functions of forming a percept; perceiving some relation 
Judgment. or relations between percepts is necessary in 
the process of conception; perceiving some relation be- 
tween concepts is necessary in forming a judgment; per- 
ceiving some relation between two or more judgments 
is necessary in constructing an argument. It isin every 
case the special function of the relational faculty, or 
judgment, to perceive these relations. It is judgment 
that compares, contrasts, selects, combines, and thus 
reaches conclusions and forms opinions. 
It is not to be supposed that there are different forms 
of judgment, but that there are different ways in which 
Kinds of judgment manifests itself. We may speak 
Judgment. of an accurate or inaccurate judgment, of an 
impartial or biased judgment, of a moral judgment, an 
zsthetic judgment, and so on; but these terms simply 
serve to name the ways in which the relational faculty 
works, or the kinds of ideas with which it works. 
In order that judgment may do its work accurately 
and the result may be trustworthy, there must be cor 
Conditions TeCt Observation, reliable memory, and the 
of Accurate absence of personal bias or vivid emotion. 
Jusging- The elements that tend to secure accuracy 
in judging are, (1) an abundance of clear concepts; (2) 
exact reproduction of these by memory; (3) freedom
-P-A-G-E-101
  INTELLECT: RELATIONAL FACULTY. IOI 
from prejudice; (4) the judicial temper, which means 
the habit of looking on all sides of a question equally. 
Defective judging is due to careless observation ; to 
unreliable memory, which does not marshal all our 
experiences when needed; to some personal bias in- 
herited or acquired ; and to the presence of strong feel- 
ing. No one can judge in a purely impersonal way; 
what is called the personal equation must be taken into 
account in every decision of judgment. 
Judgment is a measurer, and there must be some 
standard with which to measure. This standard is 
made up of our experiences in any given juagmenta 
direction. Every act of judgment implies Measurer. 
a comparison bétween some impression of sense, or 
concept, or proposed line of action, with some other 
impression already felt, or concept already formed, or 
some experience already gained, that is to be used as a 
standard. While hearing a sermon or lecture, while 
reading an article or book, judgment is or should be 
constantly at work, measuring what is heard or read by 
some standard which we have established for ourselves. 
As a teacher hears a recitation, he must constantly 
compare what is being done with what he conceives to 
be an ideal recitation, in order to judge of the value of 
his teaching; and each answer must be compared with 
(measured by) a standard answer, in order to test the 
correctness of the pupil’s knowledge, and his ability to 
express it. 
Common sense is the name given in popular speech 
to a sound and reliable judgment. It is un- 
fortunately true that “common” sense is one 
of the most uncommon, things in the world! 
When we say good common sense isa safe guide, we Common 
Sense.
-P-A-G-E-102
102 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
mean that judgment, acting free of personal bias, and 
basing its conclusions on those experiences of the indi- 
vidual which he has in common with mankind, reaches 
conclusions that can be trusted. Common sense seems 
to be automatic judgment. It is often met with in 
wholesome-minded persons who have had no formal 
education, but who have a valuable fund of experience 
and a ready and correct perception of relations. Such 
people are frequently not able to give logical reasons 
for their decisions, and are said to reach conclusions 
intuitively. It is a subject of frequent remark that 
many formally educated people have but little common 
sense: their conduct is not marked by judicious action 
in everyday affairs. 
The fact that a man may decide correctly with a cer- 
tain class of facts before him, while he may reach only 
erroneous conclusions in other matters, simply gives ad- 
ditional force to what was said above, — that judgment 
must use some standard formed out of consciously ac- 
quired experience. A man’s judgment may be almost 
infallible in the buying and selling of horses, but utterly 
untrustworthy in speculating in railway stocks. The 
judgment of the collegian may be accurate in those 
things in which he has been educated, but worthless in 
the common relations of life. So apt is this to be the 
case, that it is frequently remarked by those who lack 
school training, that such a one “has plenty of do0k 
learning, but mighty little common sense.” The man 
of experience has usually a deep distrust of the man of 
books, sometimes not unmingled with a sort of con- 
tempt. But it is the distinctive characteristic of mod- 
ern education that it is doing much to remove the 
ground of this distrust and contempt, by giving the  
-P-A-G-E-103
INTELLECT: RELATIONAL FACULTY. 103 
mind an all-round development and training, and by 
connecting book study with hand study. As formal edu- 
cation approximates the true standard, the “ self-made” 
man cannot compete with the college-made one. 
Tact is another name given to a form of common sense. 
It means the ability to perceive the “fitness of things,” 
and to adjust one’s self to it. The ¢actless person is 
constantly tangling himself up in the relations of things, 
as an awkward man does in the dress trails and curtain 
draperies and rugs at a social gathering. The tactful 
person seems to feel what is best to ‘say or to do, or 
leave unsaid or undone, in his intercourse with others. 
Everybody likes him, and is soothed by his presence. 
Tact is simply common sense mixed with sympathetic 
observation. It is one of the most practically valuable 
elements in the mental equipment of the successful 
man or woman. From lack of it, many a man has 
ruined a promising career, many a woman has become 
socially “impossible,” through careless or ignorant 
neglect of others’ feelings, or of the conventions of 
society, which, though trifling, are as fixed as law. 
The esthetic judgment, more commonly called the 
esthetic taste, is the judgment at work with those per- 
cepts and concepts that excite the feeling of msthetic 
the beautiful. All races and all individuals Judgment. 
have the love of the beautiful: it is common to all man- 
kind, and there is reason for thinking that it is shared by 
animals lower than man. But the objects that excite 
the feeling are as various as the races and conditions 
of men. The esthetic feelings will be considered in a 
later chapter. 
The esthetic judgment, or taste, is manifested in the 
selection of objects that arouse the sense of the beautiful. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
104 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
One person admires one thing; another, something quite 
different. When we say of some one that he has “ poor 
taste,” we mean usually that he does not judge of beauty 
by the standards we use. The African belle makes holes 
in her nose and lips, in which to hang ornaments; the 
Caucasian belle thinks the holes and the ornaments 
look better in her ears. The uncultured man will buy 
flaming chromos for his walls, and gaudy carpets for his 
floors, because he admires them more than the work of 
the best artists and the finest products of the loom. 
Good taste, or the lack of it, is shown'in the dress, the 
house interior, the decorations of the office, the school- 
room, the shop. 
The esthetic taste is best cultivated by means of 
artistic environment. In ancient Athens, even the day 
laborers were competent art critics, because they lived 
from infancy in an atmosphere of art that was the 
glory of Greece. Beautiful parks, handsome build- 
ings, and rich galleries of paintings and sculptures 
should be among the means used by every city to cul- 
tivate the esthetic tastes of its citizens. 
Moral judgment is the relational faculty at work in 
matters of ethics. By it all human conduct is directed. 
Moral Inthe exercise of moral judgment, some pro- 
Judgment. posed course of action is put alongside the 
standard of right which we have formed ‘s the result 
of experience and training; and the relation between 
what we are solicited to do and this standard of right 
is then perceived by the judgment. _However fallible it 
may be, each man’s judgment must, in morals and in 
everything else, be his court of final appeal. Each of 
us must do that which his own judgment affirms to be 
right. It will be seen later that there is, strictly speak- 
ing, no such thing as conscience “guiding and dictat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  
INTELLECT: RELATIONAL FACULTY. 105 
ing:” it is judgment that guides and dictates in matters 
of right and wrong, as in all other matters, while con- 
science lays upon us the odigation to do what juagment 
judgment affirms to be right. I may counsel the Guide. 
with my friend in whom I place great confidence, and 
get his opinion as to the rightness or wrongness of a 
proposed line of conduct, and I may in the end adopt 
his suggestions and follow his advice. But it is due to 
my owz judgment, in the first place, that I go to this 
friend rather than to some other, or that I recognize 
his wisdom as superior to my own; and, unless I have 
formed the dangerous habit of letting other people do 
my thinking for me, I shall submit his advice to my own 
judgment before acting upon it. 
Belief is the mind’s confidence in the correctness of 
its own decisions of judgment, is the conscious accept- 
ance of a judgment as ¢rwe, as expressing getier 
realrelations. All intelligent action is based and Doubt. 
on belief. People do not'willingly and intelligently do 
what they disbelieve: all their deliberate actions con- 
form to belief, unless they are hypocrites. 
Doubt and disbelief are inherent in some natures to 
a morbid degree. But the presence of some doubt is 
a sign of mental health: judgment is suspended until 
more knowledge is obtained. Doubt may temporarily 
paralyze action, but it should stimulate mental activity 
in the search for more and convincing facts upon which 
to base a conclusion. The best remedy for doubt of 
any kind, religious or other, is, of course, more knowl- 
edge. The more facts we have, the greater is the oppor- 
tunity for seeing them in their right relations, and 
therefore the less the room left for doubt. Correct in- 
formation and the judicial temper are the surest cure 
for disbelief or uncertainty.  
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
APPLICATIONS TO TEACHING. 
Judgment, being the faculty which adove all others 
shows us the way Zo ive, should receive a most thorough 
and careful training. There is more need now than’ 
ever before of the citizen of independent thought in 
Need of POlitics, in religion, in education. There are 
Accurate more things to discriminate between, there 
Iedgment. i; more knowledge to sift and select from, 
there are more theories to test, more errors to avoid, 
than ever before. And all this is distinctively work 
for judgment. If the schools would train for citizen. 
ship, would build young manhood and womanhood, 
they must look to the training of that faculty which 
works with the relations of things; for no fact is valua- 
ble zz ztse/f, but only as related to other facts. Even 
the existence of Deity (be it said reverently) is of value 
to us only as it is related to us, and we to it. 
The teacher should spend much effort in the direc. 
tion of getting his pupils to think for themselves. They 
should be permitted in many matters to follow out their 
own conclusions. It is only by trying and falling that 
the child learns to walk; it is only by judging and test- 
ing the conclusions, that the boy or girl comes to inde- 
pendent, self-reliant manhood and womanhood. The 
age of six or seven is not too early for children to be 
thrown upon their own responsibility in sznor matters. 
The law of use is as valid in the case of judgment as in 
the case of memory or muscle. 
A child over five years of age has a right to be 
treated as a rational being by both parents and teacher. 
Rational Children obey more readily when told why 
Obedience. they are requested or commanded to do a 
thing, and, being thus taught that obedience rests upon
-P-A-G-E-107
  
INTELLECT: RELATIONAL FACULTY. 107 
a rational basis, they will the more cheerfully obey in 
those cases in which it is inexpedient to explain to them 
the reason forthe command. Requiring rational obedi- 
ence from the children will be an excellent discipline 
for the parents too, since it will make them sure they 
have a reasonable basis for their commands to their 
children. There must, of course, be implicit obedience; 
but it should be intelligent, and commands should not 
be whimsical and arbitrary. To demand “unquestion- 
ing” obedience in all cases is absurd and wrong. 
The training of the zsthetic judgment will be further 
treated in Chapter X.; of the non-ethical judgment, 
in Chapter XV. It only remains, then, to say a brief 
word concerning the training of the ethical or moral 
judgment. The full discussion of this falls within the 
division of psychology once called “ moral philosophy,” 
but now usually termed “ ethics.” 
Spencer has left little to be said on the subject of 
moral education. According to him, the child’s moral 
nature should be educated through the per- gy aining 
ception of cause and effect; that is, the child of Ethical 
should be first taught to understand that J*4™*"* 
physical pain inevitably follows physical transgression; 
and from this he may be brought later to conclude that 
spiritual suffering will more or less immediately and 
inevitably follow moral transgression. The value of 
this method becomes the more apparent when it is 
remembered that physical transgression is usually a 
moral transgression; that is, the same thing that makes 
spiritual transgression wrong—a knowledge of its evil 
consequences— makes physical transgression wrong. 
The child must acquire ethical ideas by learning from 
experience, as well as from precept, what constitutes 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
    
108 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
the rightness or wrongness of his physical and spiritual 
acts. He must acquire moral ideas as he acquires any 
other kind; and the process of basing conduct upon 
judgments drawn from these is the same as the process 
of acting upon conclusions drawn from other kinds of 
ideas. The child must learn from experience the rela- 
tion between the careless handling of a knife and the 
pain of a cut; between playing with fire and the conse- 
quent burn; between unhygienic eating and the result- 
ing digestive disturbance; between selfishness, lying, 
petty dishonesty, and the distrust and aversion with 
which teacher and companions regard him. If the child 
be taught rationally to observe such relations, his moral 
judgment becomes quickened, and many of his wrong 
tendencies can be made to correct themselves. If pun- 
ishment must be given by the teacher, it should in every 
case, as far as possible, be made to appear to the child 
as the natural and logical consequence of his wrong 
doing. Punishment that seems merely arbitrary to the 
child, for which he cannot see a sufficient reason, has an 
effect upon character directly contrary to what is desired. 
The highest result of character building is to make 
the individual understand and feel, that, to live the 
happiest and best life, he must live it in harmony with 
God’s laws, both physical and spiritual, and that dis- 
comfort and unhappiness are the inevitable results of 
transgression. : 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
    THE INTELLECT: IMAGINATION. 109 
CHAPTER IX. 
THE INTELLECT: IMAGINATION. 
IMAGINATION is usually discussed as both a repre- 
sentative and a creative faculty. But it seems clear that 
representation is no function of imagination. To re- 
present is the business of memory. Surely some line of 
demarcation can be established between these two 
faculties which will prevent confusion of thought. I 
do not zmagine what I have seen, or heard, Tmagtiatios 
or felt, or thought, or willed: I remember not Repre- 
these things. If the thing remembered hap- *™**tv* 
pens to be an image, it is not to be taken as something 
which imagination brought up. Actual visual percep- 
tion of an object put the image of that object in the 
mind, and memory brings it into consciousness again. 
Imagination has nothing to do with it, unless to modify 
in some way the image recalled. Imagination may 
construct an image, may build something out of sense 
percepts, or concepts; but this creation once formed is 
not reproduced in consciousness by imagination—that 
is work for memory. 
Imagination can and does aid in the acquirement of 
sense percepts. For instance, my percept of a cylinder 
is clearer if I can, through imagination, see the other 
side and both. ends of the figure at the same time my 
eyes are perceiving the side presented to them.
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
The term cmage commonly suggests visual percepts ; 
but it may be used also to name other percepts. We 
properly speak of auditory images, tactile images, etc., 
by which we mean either the remembered percepts 
originally gained through the senses, or the combina- 
tions of these which are formed by imagination. 
The difference between. memory and imagination is 
shown in the difference between a remembered sensa- 
Difference tion and an zmagined one: The former is 
rae dim, dull, and seems to be a kind of echo in 
aad consciousness. The latter is full, intense, 
Memory. and so real sometimes that the correspond- 
ing end organ of sensation is affected as by an outside 
stimulus. This is illustrated in the musician’s common 
trick of closing a piece in constantly diminishing loud- 
ness of sound until the music dies away altogether and 
leaves the auditor zmagining he still hears the notes 
after they have ceased. The auditory image thus pro- 
duced is much more real and present to consciousness 
than remembered music. A simple geometrical figure 
can be so vividly imagined, that it will seem to be 
actually projected upon the field of vision, or upon the 
inner surface of the lid when the eyes are closed. Both 
natural aptitude and education determine what sensa- 
tions are best imagined in any individual case. The 
musician imagines new combinations of tones and melo- 
dies; the painter, new combinations of colors; the per- 
fumer, new odors. ’ 
There is also wide variation in the ability of different 
persons to remember the percepts of the several senses. 
One will readily recall visual images, but not auditory;

day language when we say of one person, “he has a 
good eye for form;” of another, “he has an ear ‘for 
music.” Inthe great majority of cases, however, visual 
images are much more readily imagined and remem- 
bered than any others. 
Memory and imagination work in close association; 
and each helps the other, but neither does the other’s 
work. Imagination helps to fix a percept jisaglendon 
or concept in memory by making it com- aids 
pleter and clearer; and often, when memory ™M°™Y: 
but dimly recalls some matter of past experience, im- 
agination offers various modifications and additions, 
until perhaps the right combination is made, and the 
result is recognized as a correct representation of the 
thing which was at first but dimly reproduced. Even 
in such cases, the imagination does not reproduce, but 
merely adds to or alters what has been recalled, until a 
combination is made which consciousness recognizes 
as correct. This work of imagination is precisely like 
that of a friend who, when we are suffering from a 
temporary lapse of memory, suggests words to us until 
some happy similarity of sound causes the word we are 
trying to recall to become distinct in consciousness, 
Memory, in turn, furnishes materials out of which im- 
agination builds its products. 
Memory reproduces. Imagination modifies, combines, 
creates. It modifies when it merely makes some change 
in an idea or a percept, without altering its tmagination

it puts two or more percepts or concepts together to pro- 
duce something characteristically different from either

of kind. Imagination is creative when its products are 
unlike any actual reality, when the combination of per- 
cepts or concepts is so thorough that they are fused 
together into a harmonious whole distinctively different 
from any other thing. Imagination can create no new 
material: it builds new things out of materials already 
furnished by the perceptives and memory. An artist 
may paint a face more regular and beautiful in form 
and feature than any real face, but analysis will show it 
not to contain any new facial element. The poet or 
the essayist may put two or more familiar concepts 
together so we shall see totally new relations between 
them. This is the essence of literary art. Van Norden 
attributes this sort of work to the highest activity of 
the elaborative judgment, which perceives these deeper 
and more significant relations. It is not easy to dis- 
tinguish between the highest work of judgment and the 
highest work of imagination; and this serves to illus- 
trate the essential unity of mind, —that no one faculty 
can work alone, the mind works as awhole. But judg- 
ment cannot act until thought objects are before it, then 
it perceives relations. It is the peculiar office of crea- 
tive imagination to set objects before judgment in a 
new way. 
Imagination has various forms, or rather various ways, 
of manifesting its activity. The lowest is perhaps what 
is called fancy or fantasy. It is imagination 
freed from the restraint of will and the criti- 
cism of judgment. It is commonest in daydreaming 
and reverie, when we give ourselves up to the current 
of remembrance, while fancy plays with the contents of 
consciousness, and colors them with the tints of unreal- 
ity, or combines them into fantastic or grotesque forms. 
‘ Fantasy.
-P-A-G-E-113
THE INTELLECT: IMAGINATION. 113 
But even fancy may become creative, and give such 
results as the “ Arabian Nights,” “Gulliver's Travels,” 
“She,” and that exquisite bit of fantastic composition, 
the “Culprit Fay.” Fantasy is usually characteristic 
of the idle mind: it requires effort to direct imagina- 
tion by the will, and test its products by judgment. No 
effort is required for the “ play” of fancy. It is note- 
worthy that this is the only faculty whose activity can 
be called play. For this reason, among others, it may 
become dangerous. Permitted to run riot, imagination 
becomes narcotic, and is almost as dangerous anger of 
as opiumorhasheesh. Thevictimseeks ready Fancy: 
escape from the unpleasant realities of life in the glow- 
ing presentations of fancy: he may set as deliberately 
to work as the opium smoker to build for himself pal- 
aces and gardens of enchantment. A person will come 
out of such an orgy of imagination dazed in mind and 
even physically stupefied, as by the fumes of a drug. 
The difference between the sane man and the insane 
one is, that the latter looks upon the products of his 
fantasy as real, the former is aware of their unreality. 
In widest contrast with fancy is what may be called 
‘the practical imagination. Its work is narrowly limited 
to modifying and combining the facts of ex- practical 
perience so as to produce ideas only slightly Imagination. 
different from what the mind-is accustomed to. Plain, 
“practical” men have this type of imagination: they 
cannot to any considerable degree modify their con- 
cepts, whether freshly gained, or remembered. Such 
men are always intensely conservative, not being able to 
picture vividly anything different from their own expe- 
riences. They adapt themselves slowly to any new en- 
vironment. We sometimes grow impatient with these

people, but they are very necessary to stability of type 
in race or government. They are the balance wheel 
of the social machine, and serve to regulate and correct 
the too strenuous action of the over-zealous in politics, 
in religion, and in education. Lack of imagination is 
often mistaken for sound common sense, and it does 
often produce the same results. Too vivid imagination 
becomes unpractical, sees too many visions and dreams 
too many dreams, leaving nothing alone long enough for 
it to become an integral and permanent part of a stead- 
fast individual or national life. 
At the same time, it must be remembered that if it 
were not for imagination, improvements in the arts and 
value of Sciences, and therefore in the general condi- 
Imagination. tion of peoples, would be due wholly to acci- 
dent. If nothing could be pictured as different from 
what it is, nothing better than what now is could be 
possible, except as fortunate chance might bring about 
changes. There is no occupation of life which may-n 1a] 
be the better followed with the aid of imagination:

present “his own standpoint so forcibly that they will 
be brought to see things as he sees them. No one 
has more need of this sympathetic imagination than 
the teacher. He must establish between himself and 
his pupils magnetic currents of understanding that 
will enable him to see with the learner’s eyes, and 
feel with the learner’s feelings. In no other way can 
the teacher put himself at the center of the pupil’s 
difficulties, and undo the tangles for him. The teacher 
must be in the highest sense a mind reader: this he 
cannot be, except as he can, through sympathetic im- 
agination, create in his own mind the conditions that 
exist in the mind of the pupil.

in the rough block of marble the form of immortal grace 
which his creative thought has placed there, before he 
has struck a blow upon his chisel, so must the true 
scientist project from his imagination the connected 
story and work history of rock and raindrop, of atom 
and abysmal ocean depth. In a true sense the scien- 
tific imagination is poetic and artistic. Science of the 
right sort does not stop with the mere observation and 
classification of phenomena, but is ever trying to find 
cause, an underlying unity for all facts. To this end 
creative mind works, picturing hypotheses, theories, 
possible combinations that shall contain the law bind- 
ing all known facts into harmony. To bea mere ob- 
server and collector of facts is not to be a true scientist. 
The facts, of course, we must have; but he who does” 
nothing but collect them is only a hod carrier to the 
master builder, who takes them, and sets them, by im- 
agination, in this combination and in that, until he sees 
at last their real relations. Then the boundaries of 
men’s knowledge are widened by a world’s breadth, 
and the soul is filled with new truth. 
The inventor is “of imagination all compact” as 
much as the poet. He sees the completed machine at

sible combination of mechanical elements that shall 
produce totally new results, and forthwith sets to work 
to embody the ideal, the imagined, in the actual. The 
modern typewriter is an excellent illustration of creative 
imagination. All its elements are simple and familiar, 
—two or three springs and a few levers, — but the com- 
binations of these elements, and the results produced, 
are entirely original, being unlike anything that had

been seen before. - A typewriter is, in a true sense, a 
poem of mechanism. 
Imagination enters into and colors every mental pro- 
cess, and intensifies every feeling. We have seen how 
‘it aids perception andimemory; and it is a'strong ele- 
ment in expectant attention, we imagine what to ex- 
pect; it gives power to conception, enabling us to see 
groups and classes of objects with common qualities, 
or to “see” those qualities abstracted anf unified; it 
is the basis of rational hope, since we hope for things 
we do not have, and these we can conceive of best 
through imagination; it is a help to judgment, setting 
things in new lights, and shifting the point of view, so 
judgment may discover new relations. But above and 
beyond all, it is creative, making the new out of the 
old, showing possibilities where none was supposed to 
exist, discovering harmony where all was chaotic, blend- 
ing and unifying what was diverse, adding constantly 
to the sum of wealth, knowledge, and happiness.

CHAPTER X. 
THE SENSIBILITIES. 
THE sensibilities (or feelings) are difficult to define, 
but it is perhaps sufficient to say that they are mental 
states of pleasure and pain. They are very complex, 
and intimately involved with all aspects of the mental 
life: consequently no hard-and-fast classification can be 
true. For convenience of reference and discussion, 
however, the sensibilities will here be presented under 
the three heads given in Chapter II.,—the emotions, the 
affections, the desires. The enumeration made under 
each of these heads is not intended to be exhaustive, 
but to include only those feelings which have the most © 
direct bearing upon the teacher’s work. 
The lines of demarcation between these three kinds 
of feeling are indefinite and variable, and it is not wise 
to attempt a too discriminating analysis. In 
a general way it may be said that the emo- 
tions are simple feelings, having no tendency in them- 
selves for or against their exciting causes. The lan- 
guage of emotion is “I feel.” 
The affections flow out toward the objects that excite 
them, to do them good or ill. The language of the 
affections is “I like,” or “I dislike.” 
The desires flow out toward the objects exciting 
them, accompanied by the wish to possess those objects. 
The language of desire is “I want.” Definitions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
THE SENSIBILITIES, IIg 
THE EMOTIONS. 
The emotions admit of subdivision into (1) the 
physto-psychic, or those having their origin in both body 
and mind; (2) the zwtedlectual, or those arising solely 
from mental causes, and affecting the intellect mainly; 
(3) the moral, or those affecting our ethical relations. 
Physical Emotions. 
_ There seems to be a more evident connection be- 
tween the feelings and the physical condition than is 
found in the case of any other form of mental activity. 
Bodily states and the sensibilities act and react upon 
one another in rise and fall like the sensitive mercury 
and the atmospheric column. Especially is this true in 
the case of children, and adults in whom the power to 
inhibit excess of feeling is not strong. We are all the 
time conscious of bodily states of one kind or another, 
comfortable or uncomfortable. If any one of the bodily 
organs does its work defectively, the. fact is registered 
in consciousness by a disagreeable feeling; if all the 
bodily organs are normal, and work harmoniously, we 
are conscious of a diffused feeling of well-being, there 
is a sense of vitality and health. Our consciousness of 
the body as a whole is called common feeling. 
The emotions that arise out of physical conditions 
and affect the intellect are cheerfulness, melancholy, anx- 
tety, indifference. 
Cheer fulness is one of the natural attributes of health; 
but it, like the other physio-psychic emotions, may be 
attained by purely mental effort. Cheerfulness is often 
a marked characteristic of those who suffer acute bodily 
pain. The etymology of melancholy is « black bile,”
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
but it may arise from other causes than a disordered 
liver, and is often directly traceable to impaired nervous 
energy. Anxiety and indifference are more frequently 
attributable to mental than to physical causes; but 
there are forms of these feelings that have their origin 
in some poorly nourished or overworked or under- 
worked tissue. Anxiety, in so far as it is a physical 
feeling, may be said to result from the restraint of 
some natural bodily activity. Indifference is usually 
traceable to lack of blood supply or to fatigue. 
Cheerfulness is a marked characteristic of the normal 
child, and its absence is one of the surest indications 
of ill health or abnormal temperament. Melancholy, 
anxiety, or indifference, when they arise from. physical 
conditions, are abnormal in the child, and must be 
removed before there can be effective teaching. Very 
often they may be remedied through the action of the 
mind upon the body; and the teacher’s contagious 
cheerfulness, interest, and self-control will produce far 
more marked and permanent effects than all the physic 
of the druggists. 
Intellectual Emotions. 
Of the emotions of the intellect, surprise, wonder, 
and admiration are closely related. Surprise is the 
mental shock which follows the presentation 
of anything unexpected, new, or strange, to 
consciousness. It is the same in kind, whether felt by 
the infant who is hurt, or by the scientist who stands 
face to face with some unexpected working of energy. 
Wonder is surprise somewhat prolonged and made ex- 
pectant, and admiration is wonder with approval added. 
These emotions are very vivid in children, and are Surprise.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
THE SENSIBILITIES. 121 
of great value in making the teacher’s work more effec- 
tive. A word, a picture, a definition, a process, pre- 
sented to a class in some unusual or unexpected way, 
produces a slight shock of surprise that fixes attention 
as by amagnet. In this fact is found another reason 
-why the teacher should lay aside the text-book in con- 
ducting recitations, and use his ingenuity in presenting 
the matter of the lessons in a manner that will set the 
pupils wondering “ how will the teacher begin the next 
time.” Writers and lecturers often give to their books” 
and lectures titles that will occasion a slight shock of 
surprise, and thus gain the attention of the prospective 
reader or auditor. It is easy to overdo the matter, 
however, and by falling into the grotesque to defeat 
the purpose in view. Judiciously used, surprise is a le- 
gitimate and valuable element in spoken and written 
expression. The good effect of an apt way of express- 
ing a thing is due to the feeling of surprise, often min- 
gled with admiration, which a neatly turned phrase ex- 
cites in the hearer or reader. 
Admiration isan effective aid in ethical training, as 
it awakens, and blends with, the desire to be like the 
person admired, and to imitate his deeds. 
Admiration leads to emulation, a generous 
rivalry, and in the hands of an intelligent teacher is a 
powerful stimulus. It is to this feeling, so readily 
aroused in the young, that biography owes its value 
in moral training. Parent and teacher should very 
early give the child some account of men and women 
of noble character and great achievement. 
Happiness and sorrow are the sunshine and shadow 
of childhood. Every child has an inalienable birth- 
right to happiness. Childhood should be surrounded Admiration.

of a healthy body and a joyful mind and temper. It

and child life in the crowded slums of cities the 
SO: pathetic thing it is, and turns it into a menace 
to the future. What can be expected of men and 
women whose childhood was cramped and starved in 
every physical tissue, and whose young minds knew no 
happiness? It is one of the glories of modern benefi. 
cence that it is turning more and more to children, 
providing them with playgrounds and parks, and send- 
ing small armies of them into the country every summer. * 
The fundamental characteristic of the kindergarten is 
its recognition of the necessity of a happy development 
of body and mind. 
But no life, of child or adult, can be filled with con- 
stant happiness, nor is it desirable that it should be. 
Sorrow, and its various forms of disappointment, regret, 
remorse, are disciplinary emotions, and give fiber and 
strength to character. 
Hope and fear are anticipative emotions. Hope is 
perhaps the main incentive to all human action; for, 
no matter how strong the desires may be, it 
is hardly conceivable that man would strive 
to satisfy them unless there was some hope of attaining 
their objects. If it were possible for a human being to 
lose hope utterly, his energies would run down below 
the level of brute action; for even the brutes have an 
expectation of fulfilled desire. 
The school should to some extent be a miniature of | 
the world; and hope should be used as an incentive to 
action, — hope of securing commendation from teacher 
and parents, hope of promotion, hope of graduation, Hope. 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE SENSIBILITIES. 123 
and hope of increased usefulness. In. every instance 
the object of hope should be that which has its value 
mainly in its effects upon the growth of character. 
Fear is an instinctive emotion, manifesting itself in 
the infant before there has been any possible opportu- 
nity of learning to be afraid of things through 
individual experience. It is a protective 
emotion, and is especially characteristic of children. 
The use of fear as a means of discipline, though very 
common, is rarely justifiable. The readiness with which 
the purely animal feeling of fear can be aroused makes 
it a too convenient means of securing temporary obe- 
dience in the home and the school. The nurse or the 
mother who appeals to a “bogie” or an “ugly black 
man” to come and carry off a naughty child, is giving 
practical lessons in lying, as well as appealing to one 
of the lowest motives for correct behavior. The same 
is largely true of the teacher who relies upon fear of 
the rod to secure obedience and diligent study. Fear 
has no proper place in any scheme of true ethical train- 
ing. Morality or religion based on fear is not sound. 
The child or adult who does right because afraid to 
do wrong is not moral. But it is true, unfortunately, 
that in many cases no real ethical training can be begun 
until opportunity has been secured through the restrain- 
ing influence of fear. There seems to be no higher 
motive which will react upon some children and adults. 
The feeling of skame, though seemingly a purely 
psychical emotion, is common to both man and the 
lower animals. An intelligent horse or dog 
evidences shame.at failure to secure approval, 
or when caught in some misbehavior. It is, in many of 
its manifestations, of much moral significance, being Fear.

closely allied with conscience. It may be felt by us 
for ourselves or for others. When we see others doing 
that of which we would be ashamed were we doing it, 
we feel shame on their account. 
The feeling of shame may be judiciously used in 
school training to secure correction of many faults and 
useof the formation of right habits. The pupil

lazy, or indifferent; ashamed to be dirty, to swear, to 
smoke, to fight. Many a boy or girl has been spurred 
out of evil practices by the sharp prick of judicious 
ridicule. By most educationists ridicule is wholly con- 
demned. It is liable to great abuse, but it is too ser- 
viceable and effective a means of good discipline to be 
laid aside entirely. As well forbid the use of razors, 
because they do harm in careless hands. :

The influence of the home and the school must be 
used to correct the standards of youth, and intensify 
the feeling of shame at any taint of impurity. Train 
the boys and girls to high-mindedness, and cultivate a 
pride in right thinking and right living.

to everyday annoyances. It softens the care-hardened

fully observant of the usages and manners of those 
around us. This is true not only of individuals, but of 
whole communities. The old philosopher who was un- 
decided whether to laugh or cry at the follies and sins 
of mankind, would have been wise tolaugh. The world 
has been little helped by whining pessimists ; but many 
a folly has been laughed out of existence, and many an 
evil has fled before the genial shafts of the humorist. 
Children generally have a very keen appreciation of. 
the humorous, and this should be cultivated. Nothing 
is more healthful at times in the schoolroom, or more 
preservative of genuine good order, than a hearty all- 
round laugh; not guffaws or giggles, but open, honest 
laughter. It sends the blood tingling through every. 
brain cell, and discharges every tense and tired nérve. 
A good laugh is more effective than medicine, and a 
great deal easier to take. 
Mingled with the feeling of shame, the feeling of the 
ludicrous becomes an excellent corrective of question- 
able practices in the schoolroom and on the playground, 
and is often far more effective than any form of scolding 
or formal punishment. The egoism of the young makes 
it especially painful to be laughed at. 
The esthetic feelings are universal, and are usually 
quite highly developed, even in children and the lower

races of man. The distinction must be quite carefully 
made between the esthetic feeling and the esthetic 
Hsthetic judgment. It is through the judgment that 
Feelings. we recognize a thing as beautiful according 
to the standard we have set up for ourselves; the feeling 
of the beautiful is the emotion produced by what the 
judgment accepts. The action of the esthetic judg. 
ment is almost instantaneous; the feeling is prolonged 
and diffused. Enjoyment of the beautiful is common 
toall mankind; but the standards of beauty vary every- 
where, hardly any two persons having the same in all mat- 
ters. The esthetic feeling and the esthetic judgment 
are to be cultivated together to a just appreciation of 
the beautiful. The teacher must himself love beauty in 
order to set sympathetically before his pupils the proper 
standards, and direct their observation to objects worthy 
to appeal to the judgment and arouse the sensibility. 
4ésthetic training cannot be begun too early in the 
child’s life, and should be kept up till correct judgment 
Msthetic and refined appreciation become habits. In 
Training. this as in other things the country teacher 
has every advantage; for the source of all beauty is 
nature. Art is beautiful only as it is a transcript of 
nature; literature is beautiful only as it describes nature 
or borrows its figures from nature. The beautiful in 
art and literature cannot be understood or appreciated 
unless the original in nature is known and valued, and 
a knowledge of nature can be had only at first-hand. 
The teacher can do no better thing than occasionally 
to take his class or school for an afternoon walk through 
wood and field, and point out to the eager appreciation 
of boys and girls the beauties of tree and twig and 
leaf, of hanging vine and sturdy weed, of ferny bank

and lichened stone and rail. There is more to uplift 
the mind and feed the soul in an autumn afternoon, 
filled with the mellow light and warmth of a south- 
ward sun and the color tones of autumn leafage, than 
in all the rules of arithmetic and grammar. No one 
can live up to the large measure of happiness he may 
enjoy until he can appreciate the everyday beauty of air 
and sky, sunshine and shifting cloud, sunset and dawn. 
To love these is more than to know the height of Pike’s 
Peak or the length of the Nile. The boys and girls 
who, having eyes, have learned to see, and can keep 
their minds and hearts open to all the sweet influences 
that nature will pour in upon them, have learned to 
walk with face toward God, seeing him in all his world. 
When they have learned something of beauty in 
nature, give them a taste, if only a taste, of the beauti- 
. fulin art and in literature. Put them in contact with 
the master minds that have interpreted nature best, and 
let them feel the thrill and warmth that come of every 
such contact. 
Moral Emotions. 
The moral emotions are so named because they di- 
rectly affect and enter into the ethical life. “They, to- 
gether with the judgment and will, constitute the moral 
being. They make morality and religion possible and 
vital, and keep us in the upward road. Taken together, 
they constitute what is sometimes distinctively called

The feelings of pity and sympathy are distinctively 
altruistic, and, intensified by love in its broadest sense, 
lie at the basis of all true philanthropy. They prompt 
us to alleviate the suffering and soften the lot of our 
less fortunate fellows. 
It is doubtful whether pity is felt by children; for to 
ffeel pity implies the power to generalize particular forms 
aaa of suffering into a generic concept, and this 
Sympathy in power is not developed inchildren. But with 
Children. them sympathy seems to be instinctive or 
automatic. Its earliest manifestation takes the form 
of physical imitation. Even infants will nod, or smile, 
or purse the lips, in imitation of like facial movements 
made by nurse or parent. Every one has noticed the 
bodily sympathy shown in the imitative movements of 
children as they watch a playmate swinging, or perform- 
ing some childish gymnastic feat. 
A very slight cause is sufficient to send a wave of

intensifies this emotion, as every teacher knows who 
has felt the “atmosphere” of his schoolroom either for 
him or against him in some case of discipline. A class,

member. The greatest error that can be committed in 
college discipline is to get the sympathy of the student 
body aroused on the wrong side of some administrative 
question. 
It is the subtle force of sympathy, bodily and mental, 
that constitutes what is called the esprit de corps of a 
class, a school, a church; of a fire company, a police 
platoon, an army. Without its proper influence, the 
school becomes a bedlam, the church disintegrates, the 
army isamob. Bodies of children and of men are held 
together by a common purpose and the sense of physi- 
cal companionship. 
Each person in an audience enjoys a lecture, a con- 
cert, or a play, by being one of many who enjoy it, far 
more than if he were the sole spectator or auditor; 
and, aside from any consideration of profit, a public 
speaker prefers a large audience to a small one, since 
the effect of what he says seems to be multiplied by 
the number of those who hear it. 
Even cultured communities sometimes suffer from a 
kind of psychic epidemic due to the excitability of this

aroused on the ground of “ Put yourself in his place,’ 
“How would you like to be so treated?” There is in 
many children a thoughtless bit of barbarism, a feeling of 
gratification in the pain they inflict on the lower animals 
and on weaker companions. This must be reached and 
removed through sympathy. No sight should arouse 
the righteous anger of the teacher more quickly than 
that of a boy hectoring one weaker than himself, or 
tormenting some wretched cat or dog; but punishment 
should be given through the self-inflicted discomfort of 
the boy’s quickened moral sense. Through their sym- 
pathy with suffering they have themselves felt, children 
may be brought to fzty pain and misfortune in any 
form. 
Awe and reverence taken together constitute the feel- 
ing of the sublime, and we are conscious of these in our 
Aweana Sense of the sublime in nature and in our per- 
Reverence. ception of the sublimity shown in some heroic 
self-sacrifice. The feeling of the sublime is aroused by 
a consciousness of extraordinary immensity or power in 
nature, or of intellectual or moral strength in man. The 
immensity of space as one looks into the starry sky; 
the volume and might of Niagara or the ocean; the 
moral courage of a martyr, —in the contemplation of 
these, the feeling of the sublime swells our breasts. 
Awe and reverence cannot be felt without more or less 
profoundly affecting the moral nature, and it is doubt- 
less through these that savage man has risen to any 
conception of Deity. 
These feelings are closely associated with the feeling 
of the beautiful, and through admiration and love of 
the beautiful the growing mind may easily be made 
subject to the profounder feelings of awe and reverence.

The human conscience has been the cause of much 
heated debate and profitless controversy as to its ori- 
gin and its functions. Into origins it is not 
the purpose of this book to go. It is enough 
that conscience is part of the mental endowment of the 
normal human being, and it does not specially matter 
when or how he came by it. 
Conscience should be classed with the feelings, since 
it gives pleasure and pain. But, added to its simple 
pleasurableness or painfulness, there is another element 
which makes it distinctively the moral feeling. This 
element is the sense of obligation, the feeling of ought- 
ness. “I must” is the expression of conscience. 
Conscience does not manifest itself except on occa- 
sion of acts or purposes that have a moral quality; 
and in every case conscience wazts on judgment. The 
order of action seems to be this: two lines action of 
of conduct lie open before us, we judge of Conscience. 
the rightness or wrongness of each by standards formed 
from experience and by education, and finally decide 
that one is raght, the other wrong; the feeling of ought- 
ness immediately arises, and persists until we do what 
judgment has affirmed to be right. When the right 
thing has been done, the feeling of od/igation ceases, 
and is succeeded by a glow of approval. If we should, 
as is too often the case, do what judgment has pro- 
nounced wrong, conscience begins, as soon as the deter- 
mination ts formed and before the deed is done, to cry' 
out, “I ought not,” “I must not;” and after the wrong 
deed has been committed, conscience immediately pazn- 
fully disapproves. The intensified disapproval of con- 
science, mingled with moral shame, is remorse. 
The feeling of obligation to do the right is universal ; Conscience. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  132 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
but what is right in any particular instance is largely 
a matter of individual judgment. There are certain 
things that have received general if not universal accept- 
ance as being wrong, others that are as universally pro- 
nounced right. These things upon which a general 
agreement has been reached are set forth in the Ten 
Commandments more clearly than anywhere else. But 
the innumerable minor points of right and wrong that 
arise in a day’s intercourse with our fellowmen must be 
settled by each individual for himself: the necessity is 
supreme that he must be a “law unto himself.” No 
man holds another’s judgment or conscience, and, so 
long as a fellow-mortal faithfully does what he believes 
to be right, no one is justified in thinking evil of him. 
When it is said that a feeling of oughtness is univer- 
sal, it isnot meant that every individual has it. There 
are doubtless many degraded human beings, and possi- 
bly not a few highly cultured ones, in whom there is no 
sense of obligation, or, if any, a very feeble one. In 
such people the knowledge of right and wrong may be 
as clear as in any one, but the feeling of obligation to 
do the right is absent. Such cases present some of the 
gravest problems in sociology,—problems which psy- 
chology will doubtless some day aid in solving. 
Like other feelings, conscience can be intensified and 
strengthened by arousing it through the presentation

seens*- These concepts come, of course, through the 
judgment; for it must be carefully kept in mind that 
conscience has no power of discrimination, of deciding 
as to the rightness or wrongness of an act. So in the 
case of children, whose judgment is undeveloped, the   
 
-P-A-G-E-133
THE SENSIBILITIES. 133 
judging must be done by parents and teachers, and 
certain things presented to the children as things they 
ought to do, and others as things they ought zot to do, 
In this way conscience is quickened, and judgment 
taught to discriminate. As soon as possible, however, 
the child’s judgment must be appealed to directly: 
“Do you think that is right?” “Do you believe that a 
wise thing todo?” Children respond far more readily, 
and at an earlier age, to such questions, than most 
people suppose. 
The boy or girl who is taught to use all resources of 
knowledge and experience in reaching an unbiased de- 
cision upon questions of conduct, and instantly to obey 
the imperative ought of conscience, will grow into the 
self-reliant man or woman of high integrity and moral 
strength.

CHAPTER XI. 
THE SENSIBILITIES, Continued. 
THE AFFECTIONS. 
THE emotions spend themselves in the individual in 
whom they arise: the affections urge us to action upon 
the objects that occasion them. For instance, the 
emotion of fear, unless it gives rise to a feeling of anger, 
does not prompt us to do anything to the object that 
excites it. Anger, which is an affection, is manifested. 
in a tendency to do harm to what has aroused it. 
The affections are either benevolent or malevolent: 
they impel us either to do good or to do evil to those 
who are their objects. 
Benevolent A ffections. 
Love, which has many forms, and is, as Drummond 
calls it, “the greatest thing in the world,” is that affec- 
tion which prompts us to do good, to return 
good for evil, and to make the Golden Rule 
our rule of life. It is, in its various phases, one of the 
most purely altruistic feelings that man is capable of. 
Its first manifestation is the love that is the basis of the 
family, and through the family is the’ basis of society. 
It is asa member of a family that the child first experi- 
ences this affection, and its first awakening and its con- 
stant influence should be such as to keep his after life 
sweet andclean. The family is the social unit, and the Love. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
THE SENSIBILITIES, 135 
influences brought to bear upon the child in the home 
will very largely determine what he shall be as a member 
of that organism we call society. 
Patriotism, love of country, though a much-praised 
feeling, and one that ought to be cultivated assiduously 
in many more ways than it currently is, in its 
origin, at least, isa selfish affection. It grows 
out of the love for home and family. The young patriot 
looks upon his country as a larger family, and feels a 
danger to it to be a personal danger to himself. But 
true patriotism is a sublime feeling, whatever its origin; 
and it is probably better that it has much of the per- 
sonal element in it, for men and women will readily die 
‘or what they feel touches them personally, when they 
vould not draw a blade for a mere abstraction. The 
best soldiers are not always philosophers, though doubt- 
less the loftiest love of country is due as much to rea- 
son as to feeling. 
But the teaching of patriotism too often takes the 
form of firing the citizen’s ardor for the protection of 
his country against armed ‘forces, and is by no means 
often enough directed to arousing a desire to protect 
the community, state, or nation, against the far more 
insidious and not less dangerous foes that attack the 
foundations of good government. 
Patriotism is largely a matter of sentiment with 
every one, but more especially with the child and the 
youth. The means used to arouse this feeling in them, 
then, should be such as will excite the sensibilities 
rather than appeal to the rational faculty. Every 
schoolhouse in the land, from the humblest log structure 
to the proudest pile of brick and stone, from the coun- 
try school to the university, should have a flag; and Patriotism, |
-P-A-G-E-136
    136 : PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
the pupils should be taught to look up to it, and salute 
it, and love it with a reverential love. Then there must 
be singing of patriotic songs, and reading of biogra- 
phies of patriotic men and women, and stories of heroic 
deeds. Through these, sentiment is aroused; and in 
the study of civics, now required to be taught in some 
form in most schools, much is found to call forth the 
rational element in patriotism. Every boy and girl 
should be given a clear comprehension of the princi- 
ples upon which American government is founded, and 
an adequate knowledge of the methods used in apply- 
ing these principles in practice, and the dangers which 
beset representative government. Through such incul- 
cation of patriotism, the young citizen will come to see 
that a vote cast at the people’s polls or in legislative 
halls may have more patriotism or ¢veason in it than a 
shot fired for or against the flag. 
Above and beyond the love of country, and perhaps 
in some sense out of it, there will grow up in the mature 
Philan. Man or woman the love of humanity; and 
thropy. upon this will be founded, by each one for 
himself, a system of social ethics. 
Our sense of duty to those who are for any reason 
handicapped in the race of life; our treatment of those 
who press upon us the claims of a common humanity ; 
our conduct as individuals whose lives touch the lives 
of others at numberless points, — all will be determined 
by the quality and strength of this affection. 
Love of God, not dreading fear of him, is the basis of 
any true religion, — any religion that is not fetichism or 
Love of aspecies of devil worship. All children begin

formal education may be such as to cause him to frame 
his theology upon a concept of God as being other 
than dove. 
Malevolent A ffections. 
The malevolent feelings come nearer than any others 
to disproving the assertion that all the mental activities 
of normal humanity are worthy of proper education. 
But it may be shown that these are no exception. They 
are all in a certain sense protective, and helpful in pre- 
serving the individual and the race. 
Anger and hate may be called the acute and the 
chronic conditions of the same feeling. Anger is sud- 
den, sharp, intense: hatred is anger become anger 
chronic. Both, if properly directed, wield a 4nd Hate. 
legitimate influence upon character. Both affections 
should be felt rather for abstractions than for persons, — 
for evil rather than for the evil doer, for oppression rather 
than for the oppressor, for wrong rather than for the 
transgressor. It is perhaps legitimate to feel anger 
against persons sometimes, as well as against their deeds; 
but to ate the sinner as well as the sin is never right. 
There is such a thing as “ righteous wrath.” Washing- 
ton and his compatriots were on fire with it that Christ- 
mas night on the Delaware, and at Valley Forge. All 
history shows that anger at oppression and tyranny has 
been one of the main incentives in man’s many strug. 
gles for freedom. 
These affections need proper direction in the young. 
With the intense susceptibility of children to the per- 
sonal element in all their feelings, it is difficult to get 
them to discriminate as carefully as they should between 
the person and his offending acts. They should be
-P-A-G-E-138
138 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
taught to hate lying, theft, impurity, and to be angry at 
cruelty or inhumanity of any kind. 
Envy and jealousy are wholly evil, unless they can be 
turned into emulation and generous rivalry. This fact 
Envy ana is alone a sufficient reason for not offering 
Jealousy. medals, or other prizes of intrinsic value, for 
work done in school. A prize stimulates each pupil to 
work for a purely personal end, rather than for the good 
of the whole school or class, and so fosters personal envy 
and jealousy rather than emulation and generous pride 
in the success of a fellow-student. The credit and honor 
of the class or school should always be held up as some- 
thing worth far mote than a bit of metal which only 
one person may wear, and which is a constant reminder 
to the others of their failure. 
THE DESIRES. 
The desires can, like the emotions, be classed as 
physical, intellectual, and moral. 
Physical Desires. 
The physical nature demands food, exercise, rest, 
sleep. Owing to an increased knowledge of the laws 
of hygiene and their relations to mental work, the 
teacher is much more concerned with the physical 
desires of his pupils than he formerly was. Although 
the teacher may not properly exercise any direct super- 
vision over the tables or lunch baskets of his pupils 
(except in those cities where lunches are served to the 
pupils under authority of the school boards), yet he 
may indirectly influence pupils, and through them their 
parents, in the selection of proper articles of diet, cor- 
rect methods of cooking, eating, drinking, etc. These
-P-A-G-E-139
THE SENSIBILITIES. 139 
matters are best presented by means of short, pointed 
talks, given occasionally to the whole school, and made 
to include also the hygiene of sleep, exercise, breathing, 
bathing. The teacher can aid directly in proper satis- 
faction of the desires for exercise, rest, and sleep, by 
exercising judicious control over the games and sports 
of the pupils, by properly distributing rest intervals 
through the day, and by not assigning work in the 
lower grades to be done at home at the expense of 
recreation and sleep. 
Intellectual Desires. 
The intellectual desires are the teacher’s.best helpers 
in all the work he has to do. The chief of these de. 
sires is curiosity, the hunger to know. Every child, 
and every grown person too, Joves to know. Getting 
knowledge is the natural activity of the mind; and the 
normal mind enjoys getting knowledge as a colt enjoys 
exercise, because its nature demands activity. 
Then if the student, child or adult, does not like to 
learn at school, the dislike is due to failure on the part 
of the teacher in the method of teaching, or 
failure on the part of some one to properly 
direct the earlier mental activities of the student along 
the right lines. The teacher must keep firmly fixed in 
his own mind that the normal child is hungry for knowl- 
edge, and set to work for two things: (1) to find out 
what the child likes to know about, and, if this is not 
profitable as a subject of study, to make it serve as a 
means of stimulating desire for the right kind of knowl- 
edge; (2) to make all useful knowledge attractive to 
the intellectual appetite. Even a very hungry child 
will turn away from spoiled and nauseating food, nor is 
all wholesome food equally palatable to him. Curiosity.
-P-A-G-E-140
    140 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
So a child, though filled with eager curiosity, will 
refuse uninteresting knowledge, and facts presented in 
an unattractive way; and though it is not wise to let a 
child eat only one or two articles of food wholly to the 
neglect of others, yet there is no reason ordinarily why 
he should be forced to eat eggs if he prefers steak, or 
to eat his eggs fried if he prefers them scrambled. So, 
though a pupil must not be permitted to study a few 
things to the neglect of others, yet it is not wise to 
compel him to study what is distasteful. Food that is 
not relished will provoke indigestion, and uninteresting 
facts will cause a mental dyspepsia. If it is desirable 
for any reason that the child should eat eggs, they 
should be prepared so as to tempt his appetite. If it 
is desirable that a student should give more attention 
than he does to grammar or arithmetic, these subjects 
should be made interesting, the teacher must find some 
way of presenting them that will stimulate the desire 
of the student to know more. Here again appears the 
necessity for varying the methods of teaching. Variety 
is a spice which tickles the mental palate, and quickens 
interest. Pupils grow tired of a monotonous grind of 
recitation, with no variety of method. 
The paramount business of the teacher, remembering 
that every child is interested in something, is to discover 
eae what that is, awd to use it as the means of 
Curiosityin stimulating the pupil's desire for other knowl- 
Teaching- edge, A student interested in one thing, can, 
with a little care, be got to see that he cannot know

All children are interested in concrete things; hence, 
again, the necessity for object teaching.

The curiosity of children, too often looked upon 
by their elders as annoying, is a desire that should 
be given the most liberal satisfaction by par- ede 
ents and teachers. very question that can anbalatte 
be answered to the profit of the child—and ‘*tsfed. 
most questions can be, if the answers be given simply 
and honestly—should be answered. If this be done, 
the child will rest satisfied when told, in regard to such 
questions as it may not be advisable to answer, that he 
cannot yet understand those things. The parent who 
turns away an eagerly questioning child without satis- 
fying him is giving a stone when asked for bréad. From 
the child’s standpoint there are no “foolish questions:” 
he does not know the relative value of facts, but he is 
trying to find out, and he should be helped. Both at 
home and in school the practice should be to satisfy, 
stimulate, and direct the child’s desire to know. Above 
all, incite him to find out for himself. In such way 
may be developed the beginnings of that insatiable 
hunger to know which has marked all those at whose 
imperious demand Nature has yielded her choicest 
secrets. 
Self-love, the desire for approbation, is a purely ego- 
istic feeling, and is manifested by the more intelligent 
lower animals, as the horse and the dog, as 
well as by man. Dogs and horses court ap- 
proval, and enjoy it. This feeling is manifested very 
early and quite markedly in children. They love for 
themselves, their acts, and their sayings, to be noticed 
favorably. In older children and in adults the desire 
for approval has various phases, sometimes appearing 
in combination with a morbid and painful self-distrust 
which needs a constant reassurance to alleviate it; some- Self-love. 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. — 
times manifesting itself as a perverted self-confidence 
which is deaf to any but favorable comment, or which 
may even be so well satisfied with self-appreciation as 
to be indifferent to the favorable opinion of others; 
sometimes finding expression in its highest and best 
form, in which there is a legitimate and honorable 
desire and regard for the good opinion of intelligent 
people, mingled with a just appreciation of one’s own 
Valueof Character and worth. That man is in a bad 
Self-love. way who cares for no one’s good opinion 
but his own; but he who does not seek to win his own 
‘self-approval is in a worse way. If in history there had 
been no one to hold to his own estimate of himself in 
the face of the disapproval and even denunciation of 
others, there would have been no one to stand alone 
with an opinion or a principle till the world should see, 
and understand, and move up to him. 
The child’s desire for approval is a powerful directing 
force upon his character. Until his own power to 
judge is developed, he must test the moral quality of 
his acts by the opinion of his elders. What they ap- 
prove will seem to him right; what they disapprove, 
wrong. Erroneous judgments of right and wrong that 
may be formed in this way will often require half a life- 
time to eradicate. Consciousness of this fact should 
compel the utmost care on the part of parents and of 
all with whom children are associated. A careless act, 
an indifferent word, a thoughtless smile, may easily be 
construed by a child as an approval of things that are 
questionable or wrong. Parents and relatives so often 
show at least a half approval of such behavior in a very 
young child as would be visited with quick punishment 
in an older one. This is, to say the least, confusing to 
the children’s ideas of right and wrong. . 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE SENSIBILITIES. 143 
In using the self-love of his pupils as a means of 
character building, the teacher should be careful to 
point out the classes of persons whose approval is worth 
having, and why it is worth having. He should also 
with equal care teach his pupils to be honorably self- 
confident, and not to rely wholly or too much on the 
good opinion of others. Through love of approbation, 
the young may be as easily led into evil as into good. 
Independence of character, when founded on informed 
judgment and an active conscience, is of the highest 
value. 
Ambition is one of the most potent agencies the 
teacher can use for securing from his pupils good work 
and right conduct. This feeling is a desire 
to excel in some way, and, as it is often easily 
perverted, it is dangerous as well as helpful. The boy 
may be fired with an ambition to become a noted des- 
perado rather than to be at the head of his class; and 
the girl may have an ambition to be a society queen 
rather than to be a model in deportment. The bent 
of the ambition is determined by the influences exerted 
by the home, the school, companions, and books. Par- 
ent and teacher cannot be too watchful of what boys 
and girls read. An evil book is worse than an evil 
companion: it can instill its poison quietly and in 
secret; and to it the boy or girl may turn again and 
again with inflamed imagination and growing ambition. 
Those who have the care of the young must be con- 
stantly on guard against the profound influences that 
certain classes of literature wield through their effect 
upon ambition. 
Children cannot have this feeling turned too early to 
worthy ends. Let each one become ambitious to have Ambition.

in promptitude, truthfulness, uprightness, manliness, 
womanliness. As they grow into youth, put them 
under the magnetism of the fine and noble in biogra- 
phy, history, and literature. The ambitions thus aroused 
will mold and shape the whole life to high purposes. 
Imitativeness, the desire to be or to do as others, is 
perhaps not a distinct feeling, but a complex, made up 
Imitative- Of an instinctive sympathy and the desire for

language of their companions through an unconscious 
sympathy which can hardly be called a desire. Later 
in the mental development, imitativeness becomes the 
root of ambition. The boy or girl aspires to be like 
some ideal man or woman, or to do deeds of heroism 
and beneficence after the manner of some hero or hero- 
ine. With right ideals before it, imitativeness makes 
for character. 
The social feeling, the desire for the companionship 
of one’s fellows, is used as a means of discipline every-

ment, and is so regarded by the toughest criminals; 
and any one who has seen how utterly miserable a 
child may be made by the temporary ostracism of his 
school companions is aware of the strength of the social 
feeling even in its instinctive form in the very young. 
To separate the child from his fellows is too severe a 
disciplinary measure to be used except for extreme 
reasons. 
The Moral Desire. 
Desire for harmony with God is, beyond question, 
one of the feelings of the human mind in all races. It

is manifested by the African savage, who tries to pro- 
pitiate his gods by various kinds of idolatrous worship; 
and by the civilized Christian, who seeks for unity with 
God by prayer and righteous living. 
The feelings taken together are called motives, be- 
cause they move us to action. The desires are the 
strongest motives, often not only soliciting 
the will to this or that determination, but 
carrying it by storm, and compelling us to deeds we 
would not do. The relation of the feelings to will and 
character is of the most vital concern to the teacher. 
A somewhat extended discussion of it will be found in 
Chapter XVII. As to the character and education of 
the sensibilities themselves, something further may be 
said here. 
There are a great many more forms of feeling to 
which the mind is subject than have been mentioned 
in the foregoing pages; and all have many phases, 
shades, and gradations, and many complex combina- 
tions. It is rare that any one feeling becomes so 
wholly dominant as not to be modified in some way by 
other less vivid ones. 
A striking peculiarity of the feelings is the change 
that occurs in any of them when too frequently pro- 
duced, or when too prolonged. The pleas- i : : Happiness urable ones become painful, and the painful in aiterna- 
ones lose somewhat of the sharpness of their ae 
pain. Joy too long sustained becomes dis- 
content; and it is true that to be happy we must occa- 
sionally know sorrow. The mind becomes deadened 
to prolonged fear or remorse; and ceaseless pleasure 
would be unbearable. The greatest sum of happiness

is secured from the constant balancing and alternations 
of the feelings, from their flow and counterflow, —the 
mingling of hope and fear, of anxiety and content, of 
shame and pride, the satisfaction and reawakening of 
desire. In literature and the drama both good and 
evil are portrayed —love and hate, pity and cruelty, 
the pathetic and the ludicrous—in concordant alter- 
nation. 
With the exception of the more generalized social 
feelings, as philanthropy and patriotism, and perhaps 
; of the ethical feelings, the higher animals are Higher ‘ ; Animals susceptible of the same emotions, affections, 
have and desires as man is himself. Lubbock’s Feelings. study of ants seems to have proved the ex- 
istence of the social feelings among them; and many of 
the higher animals exhibit what in man would certainly 
be called conscience. 
The first manifestations of feeling are shown in the 
simple states of physical pain and pleasure; then, in 
the human, appear joy, sorrow, fear, love. Many of 
the higher feelings, though innate, are not aroused ex- 
cept through rather complex acts of the judgment, in 
forming abstract concepts of duty, goodness, power, etc. 
The method of educating the feelings may be briefly 
stated. Objects, ideas, and zdea/s must be presented

THE WILL. 
THROUGH consciousness I know that se/f exists, and 
is the same self in essence all the time. Self says 
“TI am.” Through judgment I come to know good 
and evil, right and wrong. Through conscience I feel 
obligation, the imperative moral must. Self through 
conscience says “I ought.” But other feelings than 
conscience make their appeal. The affections and de- 
sires may all urge to action contrary to the decision of 
judgment, and opposed to the persistent promptings of 
conscience. All other motives may be arrayed against 
conscience. (During this conflict, self is aware of the 
power to say “I can and will do this,” or “I refuse to do 
that.” This power is the crowning, dominant faculty 
of mind: it is ee 
Materialists and fatalists have tried not only to ex- 
plain it, but to explain it away; but it is as much a 
fact as matter or any of the attributes of matter. Mat- 
ter and its attributes become known to us only through 
the impressions they make on consciousness by means 
of the sense organs. Our knowledge of matter, then, 
depends on consciousness, and so does our knowledge 
of everything else. It is impossible to discriminate be- 
tween the contents of the normal consciousness, and say 
this is trustworthy knowledge and that is not; therefore 
will can no more be denied than matter.
-P-A-G-E-149
  
THE WILL, 149 
Will is correctly defined as the power to determine and 
execute, Will has the power to determine upon one, or 
to reject all, of a number of alternatives. It win 
can direct the execution of a determination defined. 
as soon as it is formed, or it can postpone execution 
for any length of time. 
It is also the-faculty of expression, but may be used 
“kO7prevent expression by inhibiting speech or action. 
wat The bodily organs of will are the muscles: through 
them all expression takes place. This statement is 
easily tested and proved. Anything that is done or 
said must be done through muscular contraction: we 
smile, laugh, cry, talk, gesticulate, write, with muscles. 
But although will is the faculty of expression, and 
muscles are its end organs, yet it-has other work to do, 
in which any one or all of the other powers of ; ; All Faculties the mind become its servants. As a train Of the servants 
associated ideas passes through conscious- of Will- 
ness, will can choose one, and direct judgment to its 
consideration, can cause imagination to picture possible 
combinations of this idea with others, and can compel 
memory to recollect other similar ideas. We can, while 
sitting still, without a movement of any voluntary mus- 
cle, hold the mind to the consideration of two or more 
possible activities, and determine to follow one of them 
to-morrow or next year. It is only at the time of exe- 
cuting the determination that will is expressed in mus- 
cular movement. (will may turn the mind from one 
line of thought upon ‘another, or it may even inhibit 
thinking altogether; and all this wholly without mus- 
cular movement. 
Professor James would include the acts of will—

attending. He says, “The essential achievement—of 
will is to attend to a difficult ol object, ;and hold it fast 
before the mind;” and again, “Effort_of attention is 
thus the essential phenomenon of will.” A legitimate 
inference from these statements would seem to be that 
the business of will ends in setting and holding some 
object of thought or action in the focus of conscious- 
ness. But there is unquestionably in willing the further 
act of executing a choice, of directing thought or action 
upon the object chosen. 
The only direct physical result of an act of will is 
either the movement of a muscle or muscles, or the 
Expression inhibition of movement. Will-can be ex- 
of will. pressed either in action or in suppression of 
action; I can will my arm to move, or to stop moving. 
But’ by no means all muscular actions are due to voli- 
tion: many of them are reflex or automatic, and can 
neither be caused nor prevented by an act of will. We 
cannot directly affect the muscular action of the heart 
or the stomach by volition. All muscular action is not 
caused by will; but every outward expression of will is 
through action, or-inhibition of it. 
Will, like other mental powers, must be developed. 
The new-born child has the possibility of will, but no 
Development Will; just as he has the possibility of mem. 
ofwill. ory, but no memory. It seems to be shown 
by the observations of Preyer and others, that_will is 
developed through impulsive and reflex movements of 
the muscles. For about the first three months of his 
existence, the child’s movements are either impulsive 
or reflex. Impulsive movements may be due to some 
nervous disturbance arising in the nerve substance 
within the body, or they may be caused by the irrita- 
 
-P-A-G-E-151

tion of some of the nutritive organs. Reflex actions are 
due to some stimulus — sound, light, touch, etc. —affect- 
ing the outer end organs, which, being carried into some 
ganglionic center, stimulates an efferent (motor) nerve, 
and so produces movements of the muscles. An infant 
will frown when the light is too strong upon its eyes, 
or will draw up the leg and work the toes when its foot 
is tickled. These are reflex actions. A child less than 
three months old will hold a pencil or spoon if it is 
placed in his hand, the fingers closing over the object 
reflexively ; but he cannot reach for or grasp the object 
of his own volition, or carry it to his mouth. In the 
fourth month the child can grasp the object or let it go, 
as he chooses, and can carry it to his mouth by a 
movement which seems to be partly instinctive, partly 
volitional. From observations upon such movements 
of very young children, it has been concluded 
that the power 1 to will is is quickened into active ee 
existence by memories of timpulstve or Féflex Actions 
actions... The child subconsciously remem- oer 
bers some movement of the arm, for instance, 
and a desire is felt to repeat it. Efforts are made 
to do so, which at last succeed, and thus volition is 
established. 
One school of psychologists would have us believe 
that there is no such thing as w7//; that all movements, 
even in the adult, are due to reflex action or yyateriatism 
to the direct influence of motor ideas: that rejects 
is, when we think of some movement it is ee 
desirable to make, the idea stimulates the appropriate 
motor nerves, and these, discharging into the requisite 
muscles, cause them to contract. This theory “short- 
circuits” the current of action, as an electrician might

say, and Rts out will altogether. The eye is stimu- 
lated too much by a strong light; the painful impulse 
flows into consciousness, and starts an idea of lowering 
the window blind; this zdea starts the molecules to 
vibrating in the motor nerves running to the arm and 
hand, and by the contraction thus caused in the proper 
muscles the blind is lowered. This fairly illustrates the 
materialistic explanation of will action. 
Ward says, “ There is really nothing in the will ex- 
cept the simple fact that one of the desires prevails 
: over the other, and the action is performed Motives sy: : 
cannot be at the behest of the prevailing impulse or 
eee desire.” Ziehen, Spencer, and others of the 
“no-will” school, take more words to say the 
same thing. But according to their own principles, a 
science is not exact until its quantities can be weighed 
or measured; yet not one of them has frankly faced 
the fact that their theory of will (or no-will) is as worth- 
less as any other until the “ prevailing impulse or desire” 
or motor idea can be shown to be bigger, or heavier, 
or to have a more strenuous push or pull, than any 
other or all others felt at the time. Until they have 
constructed a balance which will show that a given 
quantity of conscience is actually heavier than all the 
desires put together, until they have contrived a moti- 
vometer which will show that charity is more dynamic 
than all the other feelings acting together, they should 
not ask an acceptance of their hypothesis. It is not 
the business of true science to'deny what it cannot 
explain. And, after all, it isno more difficult to accept 
will than to explain why an zdea, which is in no sense 
a material thing, can cause a nerve to vibrate and a 
muscle to contract.  
-P-A-G-E-153
THE WILL. 153 
But the influence of the desires or other feelies upon 
volition is very marked and important; so much so, 
that it may be safely said that the normal will does not 
choose except upon the solicitation of some motive. 
But it is no whit less true, for that, that the will can 
choose which motive shall prevail, or can even refuse 
to choose or to order any action at all in a given case. 
It can put all the motives aside, no matter how clam- 
orous and insistent they may be, and decline to do 
anything. To admit any other view of will is to relieve 
man of all responsibility; to make him an automaton 
wound up by some inexplicable process, and set going 
by “pressing a button.” The murderer is simply the 
victim of his “motor ideas,” and it would be as silly to 
hang him as to hang a steam boiler for exploding and 
killing some one. The thief isa mere machine, run by 
the force of the “prevailing desire,” and is no more 
responsible to God or man than the wind that robs a 
man of his hat. Rather dangerous doctrine that, but 
it is all in the “no-will” theory of man’s actions. 
There are, however, cases of diseased will, in which 
the individual can choose, but cannot determine or ex- 
ecute his choice. One man could not takea win may

it at his command; another found great difficulty in 
forcing himself to cross a street, and it was impossible 
for him to pass a vacant lot; another, after having 
written a legal document, could not complete the sig- 
nature. These persons were sane in body (suffering 
from no paralysis) and sane in mind, with the excep- 
tion that, in spite of the strongest desire to do, the 
will could not bid the muscles to contract. Every one 
recognizes such cases of “no-will” as abnormal. _ With

them the “motor idea” moves nothing, the “ prevailing 
desire” does not prevail. 
Sense impressions and desires are the occasion of 
willing, but they do not cause the will to act; much 
less do they take the place of will. Rie eethen ae 
be said that the wall zs all there zs in hu Ction: as

To be conscious of no selfpower to direct thought 
and control action, would weaken every effort toward 
righteousness, would check every moral impulse, and 
reduce man below the level of the brute; for the brute 
could not consciously share in the degradation of acting 
always as a mere machine.

OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 155 
CHAPTER XIII. 
OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 
THE preceding pages have presented some discussion 
of the powers or faculties of the mind, and have offered 
some suggestions as to how these may be developed 
and trained. It is proposed to investigate now the 
operations of these faculties, working singly or in groups. 
There are three general operations of the normally 
active mind. These have been referred to before (Chap- 
ter IV.), and are acquisition, assimilation, reproduction. 
They may be broadly defined as follows: — 
Acquisition is the operation of gaining and storing 
facts, ideas, words, so that memory shall retain and recall 
them. It is the process of taking in mental 
food. But as, in the bodily economy, food 
is of value only when it is properly digested and assim- 
ilated, so, in the mental economy, no fact or bit of 
knowledge is of value unless it is correlated with other 
facts, and interpreted by things already known. Facts 
are valueless unless comprehended in their relations to 
the known. They must be assimilated (made like) to 
the body of our knowledge and thought already formed 
in consciousness. To assimilate is to understand. 
As bodily health and activity are measured by what 
the body can do, by the labor it is capable of perform- 
ing, by the strength it derives from assimilated food, 
so must the mind be tested by the amount of work it Definitions.
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
does, by the new thought created, and by the expres- 
sion of thought in language, action, and character. 
Hence reproduction, as here used, means the creation 
and expression of thought. 
Acquisition involves the activity of the perceptives, 
of judgment, and of memory. 
All the senses are acquisitive, whether working sepa- 
rately or together. Observation is often used to name 
the acquisitive function of the senses. The two terms 
acquisition and observation are nearly synonymous as 
applied to the work of the senses, but have this differ- 
ence: observation refers more to the outward act, is an 
objective term; while acguisition refers more to the 
inward act, and is the subjective term. 
The processes of acquisition are perception, conception, 
retention. 
PERCEPTION. 
Perception ts the process of gaining primary ideas 
through the senses and the intuition. The products 
of perception are called perigpts. 
The word perception means, etymologically, “taking 
through.” A percept, then, is something “taken 
Perception through” the organs of sense. Each sense 
defined. gives its own peculiar percept, and all the 
senses acting together give a combined sense percept. 
If all the senses are engaged in carrying impressions of 
the object of sense to the mind, the result may be called 
a complete percept. To illustrate, here is a bell: as we 
examine it, the eye gives the percept of color; the ear, 
of sound; the tongue, of metallic taste; the skin, of 
smoothness or roughness, and temperature; the mus- 
cles, of hardness, shape, and size. When these several 
percepts are combined in consciousness, the result is a
-P-A-G-E-157
  OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 157 
complete percept of the bell as a whole. The separate 
percepts of red color, sweet taste, sweet odor, round 
shape, small size, etc., when combined, give us the per- 
cept of an apple. In like manner are formed all com- 
plete sense percepts. The union of sense percepts is 
instantaneous in the case of any familiar object, but 
requires a noticeable interval of time in the case of 
new objects. 
As was previously shown, the eye has acquired the 
secondary power of determining size, shape, and even 
distance and weight, so that usually only the eye is 
brought into use to give us percepts of objects. 
The exact succession of events in the formation of a 
percept may be recorded, but ow these events are 
caused is a different matter. The process of, ¢. cessive 
for instance, visual perception, may be given _ Steps in 
as follows: Some object, luminous either by Pere?” 
its own or reflected light, emits light-rays, which, by 
purely mechanical processes, pass through the pupil of 
the eye, and are focused’ on the retina so as to form an 
inverted image of the object. The vibrations of light 
falling upon the retina set up within it molecular dis- 
turbances (photo-chemical, according to Ladd), which 
in turn occasion a series of molecular movements in the 
optic nerves. These movements are carried in to the 
brain, and are perhaps transmitted to the outer layer 
of the cerebrum. Here they cease to be nerve move- 
ments, and decome a visual percept. Up to the image 
upon the retina, vision is a purely mechanical process, 
and may be so far performed by a good camera rather 
better than by the average human eye. 
Of the cause and method of nerve excitation, or 
molecular disturbance in retina, optic nerve, and brain,
-P-A-G-E-158
    
158 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
we can know a little; but of the way in which these 
molecular vibrations in the nerve matter are transformed 
into, or produce, mental states, we know absolutely 
nothing. We can go with the nerve vibration up to the 
point where it ceases to be a nerve tremor, but between 
that point and where it becomes a mental image there 
is a “great gulf fixed” which no human science or 
philosophy has yet bridged. 
To have a percept, then, there must be an excitant, — 
light-vibration, sound-vibration, or some form of con-

Perception. the proper afferent nerves; a transforma- 
tion of this molecular nerve disturbance, at some point 
in the brain, into a mental state, a something in con- 
sciousness called a sensation; and finally this sensa- 
tion must be referred by consciousness to the external 
excttant as its cause. Without this last step there is no 
true perception. If it were not for this act of conscious- 
ness in referring the sensation to some external object 
as its. cause, the mind would never be aware of an exist- 
ence external to itself. At what point in its develop- 
ment the mind begins to refer sensation to an external 
excitant as cause, it is impossible accurately to say. 
It should be noted that the terminology of descrip- 
tive psychology is still somewhat confused, not being 
ees clearly differentiated from terms used in 
used in Dif- popular speech. Hence it is well to remem- 
ferent Senses. her that perceive, perception, and percept are 
sometimes used with» meanings more extended than 
those given in the preceding pages. We say of intui- 
tion (judgment) that it perceives the ideas of space, 
time, being, etc.; and that it also perceives other truths,
-P-A-G-E-159
OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 159 
relations, and meanings, —as when we speak of per- 
ceiving the drift of one’s remarks, of perceiving the 
thought in a sermon, a lecture,a book. The terms are 
thus used almost synonymously with conceiving, con- 
ception, concept. But these different applications are 
not so conflictive as they seem, if we bear in mind that 
in each instance where intuition is said to perceive, it 
acts as a presentative faculty, giving a truth or a real 
relation directly to consciousness. 
Percepts, whether gained through the senses or 
through intuition, are the elements of knowledge. 
Sights, sounds, shapes, temperatures, tastes, odors, and 
other percepts of physical sense ; axioms, and Pereapte the

edge. Percepts are stored in memory, and from this 
accumulated store we draw as we need. Out of percepts 
we build concepts, as shown below; but percepts them- 
selves give us many of our keenest pleasures and purest 
delights, as in the colors of a sunset sky or an October 
forest, or in the blending of musical tones. 
CONCEPTION. 
The next process of acquisition is conception, which 
may be defined as the act of acquiring general ideas by 
the combination of percepts or other concepts, conception 
or of percepts and concepts.. The products of defined. 
*" conception are concepts (general notions). The steps 
in the formation of a concept are comparison, abstrac- 
tion, identification (or classification), denomination, defi- 
nition. The faculty by which conception is effected is 
Judgment.
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
By observation — that is, by exercising the senses ---. 
we gain more or less complete percepts of a number of 
objects. These objects, or the percepts of them, we 
compare ,; that is, note their resemblances. The com- 
mon properties or attributes we aédstract, or draw away 
from the others. These abstracted common qualities 
are put into a group or “ bundle” by themselves (¢denti- 
fication); and this group becomes the type of all ob- 
jects possessing these qualities in common, and is named 
(denomination) with a class name. Finally, we define 
when we are asked to make plain to others what our 
concept is, or when we would be sure of a clear notion 
in our own consciousness. To illustrate: we see from 
time to time several objects, — some square, some round, 
some tall, some low, some handsomely finished, others 
roughly so, — but all are alike in being made of metal 
and in having a cavity inside to hold fire. These com- 
mon characteristics we abstract, group together, and 
denominate (or name) the result “stove.” Before the 
‘word stove could call up the corresponding concept in 
the mind of one who had never seen a stove, it would 
have to be defined in intelligible terms. 
A percept is the immediate result of the mind’s recep- 
tion of impressions through the senses: a concept is the 
result of anact oracts of judgment (the relational faculty) 
in discerning resemblances, and grouping like objects 
together under a general idea. 
This general description and illustration of the forma- 
tion of a concept applies more particularly to concrete *

OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. {61 
cepts of even material things contain elements that the 
senses alone cannot directly furnish, but which must 
be gained through judgment, and quite often through 
feeling. Most of our concepts are complexes of sense 
percepts, other concepts, and feelings. 
We can trace step by step the formation of only the 
simplest ideas, as the concept dog or man. It is diffi- 
cult to distinguish all the elements that enter into our 
concept of religion, or society, or evolution ; or to follow 
in detail the synthesis by which the elements were put 
together to make the concept. It is safe to assert, 
that in every act of conception there are, broadly 
speaking, all the stages given on the preceding page, 
the most important ones being comparison and identifi- 
cation, or the search for and recognition of similarities. 
But we are able to make a concept clearer and to get 
a firmer grasp of it by discrimination, —the discern- 
ment of difference between percepts or con- _piscrimi- 
cepts. The first impulse of the mind is to mation. 
seek for and perceive resemblances: the perception of 
differences is secondary, and seems to be at first a 
negative act, a perception of lack of resemblance. The 
ability to discriminate is an element of the highest 
value in skz/7. Skillful physical or mental work requires 
quick recognition of slight differences and discrepancies. 
Abstract concepts—concepts of goodness, beauty, 
color, etc. — are formed by abstracting these qualities 
not only from other qualities of the objects, abstract 
» but from the objects themselves, and are Concepts. 
evidently made up of but one quality instead of sev- 
eral. But to form a concept from this one quality, we 
must have seen it manifested in different objects and 
in various ways. We must have seen various manifes-

tations of goodness, and must have known several good 
people, in order to form the abstract concept goodness. 
Of course, no one consciously goes through all the 
steps above described, in the everyday process of gain- 
ing concepts of new things. The steps fol- Steps in i Conception !ow one another so rapidly as to be almost 
almost Simul- simultaneous, but a little close analysis on the taneous. : 
part of the student of mental phenomena will 
readily separate them. 
Children and primitive peoples, in forming concepts, 
abstract only the most evident and most similar proper- 
ties of the objects observed, and consequently many 
of their concepts are imperfect and untrue. By some 
ancient naturalists, for example, the turtle was classed 
with the quadrupeds, because it has four legs. 
As the human mind grows in logical power, it seeks 
more and more closely for real and distinctive resem- 
Most Essen. Plances and differences. The most impor- 
tial Resem- tant determining resemblance upon which we 
blance- most often classify objects, is resemblance in 
Junction. The classifications of the systematic natural 
sciences— botany, zodlogy, and their subdivisions —are 
built upon functional resemblances. Only the simplest 
and most primary concepts are based on or derived from 
the mere external accidents of color, sound, weight, etc. 
It has been claimed that a concept must be made up 
of two or more percepts; that a concept—a notion of 
a class of objects having common properties 
age or functions—cannot be gained from one 
gained percept. This is doubtless true to some ex- 
Sere, tent of the child mind or the undisciplined 
mind, which must perceive many objects be- 
fore their common attributes will be perceived as com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  
  OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 163 
mon, grouped together in consciousness, and named. 
But the mind trained in even a slight degree can un- 
doubtedly gain a concept of a wholly new class of 
objects from the careful observation of one of the ob- 
jects. Here are the extremes: some of the African 
low tribes, not having power to arrange their individual 
percepts into general groups, have no class names for 
objects,—no such names as ?¢ree, or cattle, or persons. 
But a cultivated intelligence can grasp the general idea 
of, for instance, skates, from seeing one pair of skates, 
or could even pass through the idea of drunkard to 
the abstract concept of drunkenness from seeing for 
the first time one drunken man. 
There is a class of ideas that may be called individual 
concepts, as the concept of a particular person or thing. 
Such concepts are made up of the attributes Inaividuat 
or peculiar characteristics of an individual. Concerts. 
Certain attributes enter into my concept of my friend 
Henry Brown, or my dog Jack. These are the attri 
butes by which I distinguish these individuals from 
others of the same class. 
A concept having been once formed, all objects ob- 
served to have the properties from which the concept 
is made up are immediately classed with the ppercep- 
concept already formed. Thus, if I have to 
the concept fern, all new objects having the attributes 
entering into my concept are classed as ferns. 
If any new thing be perceived, the mind at once 
tries to assimilate it (make it similar) to some concept 
already acquired. It is said the natives of one of the 
South Sea Islands, who were familiar with sheep but had 
never seen a hog, called the first porker brought to their 
shores a “grunting sheep.” The concept sheep was the
-P-A-G-E-164
164 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION, 
one which the percept of the hog most nearly resembled. 
This spontaneous act of the mind in immediately seek- 
ing something in its store of ideas with which to classify 
a new idea, is sometimes called apperception, the trans- 
lation and interpretation of the new in terms of the 
known. It is one of the first distinctive steps in the 
elaborative operation to be described as assimilation. 
Apperception is therefore an elementary classifica- 
tion, the grouping of concepts. The term classification 
is used in two senses. In one it means the act of 
identification in the process of forming concepts; that 
is, the act of recognizing resemblances, and grouping 
them together in consciousness. In the other sense it 
is used to name the process of grouping concepts; that 
is, putting into the same class objects that have essen- 
tial points of agreement. For example, we classify 
minerals, plants, and animals in the several sciences 
treating of them. For the sake of precision, it is bet- 
ter to use classification in this latter sense, and to use 
identification to express the recognition of resemblances 
in forming concepts. 
It may be worth while to say here, that there hardly 
seems to be sufficient ground for the assertion some- 
mhaaent times made, that there cannot be thinking 
without without language. It should be plain that 
Werds. there can be; for every one has concepts for 
which he has no names, and can carry on a line of 
thought that cannot be successfully put into language. 
Every child thinks for some months before he masters 
even a few words, and the deaf-mute is sometimes quite 
advanced in rational thought before he has possessed 
himself of any rational language. It would be valuable 
to know in what way Laura Bridgman formed her con-  
-P-A-G-E-165
  OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 165 
cepts, and in what terms or symbols she carried on a 
line of thought. We must conclude, of coutse, that 
she thought wholly in actz/e images; and yet how she 
could do this must remain a mystery to us who possess 
all the senses. 
Definition, which has been given as the last step in 
conception, is not, strictly speaking, a pro- 
cess in the formation of a concept; but a 
concept is not clearly fixed, not wholly possessed, until 
it can be accurately defined. 
Schuyler defines a definition as “such a description 
of a thing, whether an object or a class, as will dis- 
tinguish it from all other things.” A correct, concise 
definition— one that excludes all that does not fall 
within its meaning, and zucludes all that does—is a 
delight to the logical soul. It is to a concept what 
minting is to precious metal: it strikes into clear and 
accurate form and shape the raw bullion of our concepts, 
and gives them currency in our communication with 
others. 
A complete definition is a sentence composed of 
subject, copula, and attribute. 
The attribute of suchasentence is made up of two parts 
—the proximate major genus (nearest greater parts ofa 
family) and the differentia (specific differ- Definition. 
ence). The following illustrations will make these tech- 
nicalities plain:— Definition. 
prox. major genus. differentia. 
1. A polygon is a \plane surface\ bounded by straight 
lines. 
pm. g. differentia. 
2. A triangle is a ‘polygon' ‘having three sides: 
differentia, p.m. &. 
3. A square ts an ‘equilateral Tectangle!
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
To say that a polygon is a plane surface is not suffi- 
cient, because there are plane surfaces that are not 
polygons; hence polygon has to be differentiated from 
other plane surfaces by specifying its straight-line 
boundary. 
It is not exact to define a triangle as a polygon, for 
there are many polygons that are not triangles: the 
definition is completed by adding the differentia, Zav- 
tng three sides. 
To say that a square is a polygon, though true, would 
not be a definition, since the term polygon includes other 
plane figures besides the square; that is, polygon is not 
the nearest greater family containing squares. 
It is both very easy and very necessary to make 
accurate definitions of mathematical terms, but it is by 
no means so easy to make good definitions of terms in 
everyday use. It is impossible to give perfect, logical 
definitions tosome terms; for words are natural growths, 
and are not always subject to logical rules. 
Some further illustrations of definitions are added: 
4. A diamond is the hardest gem. 
5. Airis a gas composed of one fifth oxygen and four 
jifths nitrogen. "3 
6. A hat is a head covering with a brim. 
7. Life is a force that manifests itself through growth 
from within. 
From these examples it will be seen that there are 
different kinds of specific differences, and different ways 
of placing them as modifiers of the proximate major 
genus. In each case the differentia is an adjective 
element in the sentence, and may be placed before or 
after the proximate major genus, and may be a word, 
a phrase, oraclause. It may, as in 1, 2, and 3, describe
-P-A-G-E-167
OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 167 
a mathematical property; or, as in 4 and 5, a structural 
characteristic; or,'as in 6, a mechanical part; or as in 
7, a function. : 
It should be noted, that, in the language of Schuyler, 
“the subject and predicate of a definition are coexten- 
sive and interchangeable.” A definition, like an alge- 
braic equation, should read correctly either way. 
The teacher will find it a most profitable exercise, 
both for himself and his older pupils, to have occasion- 
ally a thorough drill in defining common terms, such 
as chair, table, mouth, door. It is an excellent plan, 
also, to test the definitions met with in study or read- 
ing. Evenacursory examination will show that many 
popular text-books are woefully deficient in both the 
number and accuracy of their definitions of terms used. 
The student has to flounder through a mass of names, 
many of them technical or used technically, without 
gaining clear-cut and accurate ideas of the subject. 
Hence too many school-bred men and women are loose 
thinkers, and are inexact in expression. 
A term denotes (names) all the objects of a class: it 
connotes attributes or characteristic qualities of the ob- 
jects ina class. For example, the term dog ).. tation 
denotes (names) all animals of that class,— and 
they are all called dogs; it connotes the attri. Copmetstion- 
butes or marks that distinguish dogs from other animals. 
Denotation refers merely to the name: connotation 
refers to the characteristics marking the object, which 
are included in the definition. The denotation of a 
term is usually pretty clear, especially if the term is 
a familiar one; but its connotation is not always clear, 
even when the term is one in everyday use. We all 
know, for instance, the object named by the term chair;
-P-A-G-E-168
168 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
but an attempt at an accurate definition of chair will 
soon convince the experimenter that he is not so sure 
of its connotation , that is, he may not have clearly in 
mind the qualities that must be named to differentiate 
chair from every other kind of seat. 
No argument should ever be undertaken, no demon- 
stration attempted, without a preliminary defining of 
eee all important terms entering into the propo- 
of Defini- sition, and an agreement as to their connota- 
¥en. tion. Many words and much temper could 
be saved by such precautions. Frequently, at the 
close of a heated argument, the disputants find they 
have been talking about very different things under 
the same name, and that, if they had carefully defined 
their terms at the outset, they would have found them- 
selves in agreement from the first. 
In using definitions in teaching, it should not be for- 
gotten that a definition is valuable only as the pupil 
has the corresponding concept, or at least its essential 
uncombined elements, already in consciousness. He 
can understand a definition only as he already knows 
the thing defined. The memorized words of a defini- 
tion often convey no meaning to the pupil. A good 
working principle for the teacher is, therefore, not to 
give a formal definition to the child, or require him to 
give one, until the child knows the thing,— has formed 
the concept. In the case of older pupils the definition 
may sometimes be given first, and the corresponding 
concept will be suggested by the words of the definition, 
if they are sufficiently familiar. 
Properties of Concepts have the properties of clearness, 
Concepts. distinctness, extension, and comprehension (or 
intension).
-P-A-G-E-169
  
OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 169 
A concept is clear when it is discriminated in con- 
sciousness from other concepts. We have a clear 
concept of forse when we can properly and readily 
discriminate between a horse and all other objects. 
A concept is distinct when the attributes that go to 
make it up are plainly comprehended. When we know 
all the essential attributes that mark a horse, and have 
them grouped together in consciousness, we have a d7s- 
tinct concept of horse. The ability to give class differ- 
ences, as the difference between horses and dogs, is a 
test of clearness: the ability to accurately define, that 
is, to give the marks or attributes that make up a con- 
cept, is a test of distinctness. 
By the extension of a concept is meant the number 
of different objects denoted or named under it. 
By comprehension (intension) is meant the number 
of attributes or qualities connoted under the concept. 
For example, the extension of the concept man means 
all the different races and kinds of men: the compre- 
hension of the concept means the qualities that dis- 
tinguish man from other objects. Extension and com- 
prehension vary znversely : the greater the extension of a 
term, the fewer the attributes or qualities comprehended 
under it. The term aximal is more extensive than the 
term man, because it includes man and all other animals: 
it is less comprehensive, because we need to name fewer 
attributes in order to define animaZ than we do to define 
man. 
The most extensive concept is being, since that in- 
cludes all existing things: the most zztensive concept 
is that of some individual object, as John Smith. We 
need name but one attribute to define being: we must 
name very many to discriminate /ohn Smith from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  
170 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
multitude of his fellows. The terms man, animal, 
student, lawyer, may be arranged in the order of their 
extension thus : — 
Animal. 
Man. 
Student. 
Lawyer. 
The term animal includes (extends over) all below it. 
More attributes have to be named to define /awyer than 
to define animal. Lawyer, therefore, has the greater 
comprehension ; animal, the greater extension. 
The relations of concepts in extension and compre- 
hension will be further discussed under the following 
subject. 
Outlining. 
Outlining is to a series of related concepts what 
defining is to the smgle concept: it serves to fix their 
order and comparative importance in mind, and to 
make clear their mutual relations. As a definition 
shows the essential marks or attributes of a concept, 
so an outline shows the order and relation of the 
objects forming a class, or the sequence and connec- 
tion of thoughts in a subject. 
Outlining is the process of arranging a series of con- 
Outlining Cepts in logical order, upon some principle 
defined. (one or more) of mutual relation. 
An outline of a concept or series of concepts in ex- 
tension is called dzvision : an outline of a concept with 
reference to the parts of the object is called partition. 
To illustrate: to outline man in extension would be 
to divide mankind into the different races and kinds 
of men; to outline man in partition would be to give 
the parzs of a man (as head, trunk, and extremities), and
-P-A-G-E-171
  
OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 171 
to separate each of these into its parts. The one rule to 
be carefully observed in making an outline is, the basis 
of division or partition in any portion of the outline 
must be plainly set forth and faithfully followed. It 
would be manifestly illogical to divide man into Negroes, 
Indians, club-footed, bachelors, and Chinese; or to par- 
tition man into head, trunk, lime, nerves, and extremi- 
ties. But if there be several different bases of separa- 
tion, all these items, and many others, will fall logically 
into place. Thus man may be divided (classified), upon 
the basis of religious faith, into Buddhists, Moham- 
medans, Christians, etc.; upon the basis of color, into 
the yellow, the brown, the black, the white races; upon 
the basis of occupation, into farmers, lawyers, carpen- 
ters, etc. Man may be partitioned, upon the basis of 
mechanical parts, into head, trunk, extremities; upon 
the basis of chemical composition, into lime, water, salt, 
etc.; upon the basis of function, into the motive sys- 
tem, the nutritive system, the sensitive system. 
An outline of a sudject for an essay, lecture, debate, 
etc., may include more than division and partition; for 
example, in an outline of /orse as the subject of an essay 
or book, could be included not only the kinds of horses 
and the anatomical parts of a horse, but also the origin, 
history, uses, diseases, training, etc., of horses. 
It is necessary for the scientist, the public speaker, 
the essayist, especially for the teacher, and in short 
for every one who would have mind direct his y.. ana 
work economically, to outline clearly the mat- Value of 
ter in hand. The elaborate classifications of Ou*inin€- 
the botanist and the zodlogist ; the arrangement of the 
heads and subheads of a sermon, a political speech, a 
lecture, or a recitation; the grouping of the topics and 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
paragraphs in a newspaper or magazine article; the 
planning of a day’s work on the farm or in the kitchen, 
—are all simply outlines, the orderly arrangement of 
concepts according to their relations and logical se- 
quence. 
No proof is needed to make plain the fact that out- 
lining aids memory, and is a great saver of time, of 
thought energy, and of vital force. It gives lucidity 
and connectedness to lectures, to essays, to narrations, 
to scientific treatises, and to works of fiction. It en- 
ables the teacher to group and concisely present the facts 
of a lesson, and to make each question hit the mark. 
It enables the farmer, the blacksmith, the carpenter, the 
housekeeper, to take the fewest steps, to make the 
fewest strokes, to accomplish the most with the least 
effort. Outlining means, in everyday affairs, clearly 
thinking out beforehand what is to be said and done, 
and how it is to be said and done. To go to work at 
anything without a plan (an outline) is to incur loss of 
time and energy, if not failure. 
There is no better school exercise with which to cul- 
tivate judgment, as well as the power of observation 
and memory. The younger pupils may be exercised in 
outlining, both in extension and comprehension, the 
concepts of chair, table, house, tree, flower, etc.; and 
the older ones will find great profit,and so will their 
teachers, in outlining both orally and in writing the 
doings of a week or day at home or at school, the ser- 
mon or lecture they have heard, the books and papers 
they have read. 
The degree of ability to outline affords a very just 
test of the power to think; and by the application of 
this test, many a talker and writer will be found to be  
-P-A-G-E-173
  OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 173 
a mere word machine, and many a teacher or farmer or 
merchant be proved to be a clumsy, blundering doer of 
what has not been clearly thought out beforehand. 
One of the chief values of outlining to the teacher is 
that it frees him from his bondage to the text-book. 
The teacher who goes before a class with a clear outline 
in mind, not only of the Zesson matter but of how he 
shall present it, will not need a text-book with which 
to “hear the lesson.” Almost every study in the com- 
mon school course may be outlined profitably; but 
history and civics, physiology, grammar, and arithmetic, 
are especially adapted to being taught by outline and 
topic methods. The pupils should also be carefully 
drilled in outlining the subjects of their compositions, 
before writing. 
An outline may be mechanically expressed in various 
ways. Many systems have been used, the most conven- 
ient of which are the brace system and the yyetnoas of 
numeral (or numeral and literal combined) expressing 
systems. A few simple examples will suffice ou 
toshow how these systems are used. An outline of trees 
would take the following form in the brace system :— 
White. 
Oak. Red. 
Kinds. Black, etc. 
Maple. 
Walnut, etc. 
Trunk. Trees. Root. 
Parts. 
Branches, etc. 
To yield wood. To give shade. 
Uses. 
To prevent drought, etc. 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
Se ee eee 
| 174 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
The same outline in one of the commonest numeral 
systems would take this form:— 
Trees. 
I. Kinds. 
1. Oak. 
| (1) White. 
(2) Red. 
(3) Black. 
2. Maple. 
3. Walnut. 
Il. Parts. 
1. Root. 
: 2. Trunk. 
3- Branches. 
III. Uses. 
1. To give shade. 
2. To yield wood. 
3- To prevent drought. 
For brief outlines either is good. The brace system 
is especially serviceable in diagrammatic work, when 
relations of concepts are to be pictured. The objec- 
tions to the brace system are, that it requires too much 
room, and it cannot be read aloud so that a listener may 
follow the relations expressed. The latter objection 
disqualifies it for ready and general use in class work. 
The objection to the numeral system shown above is, 
it cannot readily be carried into many subdivisions. 
Long use has shown that a form of the numeral 
system called the exponential is the most serviceable for 
all purposes, whether in the schoolroom or elsewhere. 
The outline shown above would be expressed by the 
exponential system thus:—

1’ Roots. 
2’ Trunk. 
3° Branches. 
3° Uses. 
1” To give shade. 
2’ To yield wood. 
3° To prevent drought. * 
A glance will show that the relation of concepts is 
shown in this system in two ways, — by an exponential 
figure and by position. The numeral expressions 1’, 
2’, etc., are called zzdices : the small figures are the exfo- 
nents, and the large figures are numerals. The expo- 
nents show the degree of division or partition, and 
mark the coérdination and subordination of concepts; 
and the numerals merely number the items. The 
exponent, therefore, is the important figure. 
This system of outlining was invented by Dr. Alfred 
Holbrook of Ohio. Dr. John B. Minor of Virginia also 
worked out the same system independently, except that 
letters are used as exponents ; and his well-known trea- 
tise on law is outlined throughout by it. The illustra- 
tion given above would appear in his letter-exponent 
system as shown at the top of the next page.

The exponential system has come into very general 
use in schools whose teaching is by subjects rather 
than by text-books. 
For the help of those who may be unfamiliar with 
this very valuable mechanical aid to orderly thought 
and logical memory, the following rules are appended : — 
(1) All indices having the same exponent are written 
in the same vertical column. A notebook or paper ruled 
both ways is a great aid to neat work. 
(2) At each subdivision of the subject, the exponent is 
increased by one, and the index is written below and a 
little to the right of the beginning of the line above. 
(3) Nothing should be written to the left of the index. 
The application of these simple rules will be seen in 
the examples of outlines here given. A few other 
illustrations showing the use of outlines as topic lists 
in common school subjects are given here.

The reader is referred to Chapter II. of this book for 
a fuller exemplification. : 
Teachers should carefully keep sight of the fact that 
the real arrangement is in the mind, and the mechanical 
outline is merely a help, not an end; just as the written 
solution of a problem in arithmetic is merely the out- 
ward mechanical expression of what is already analyzed 
mentally. The danger in using outlines is that teacher 
and pupils are apt to overdo them, and make them ends 
instead of means. 
Properly used, the outline is an excellent aid in all 
thinking and doing, for the facu/ty used in forming 
and classifying concepts is judgment. By its power of 
judging, the mind decides that two objects or thoughts 
agree in some respect, have a quality in common, and 
should be named in the same class. Judgment is 
constantly at work in the process of comparison, classi- 
fication, and outlining. This is evident when it is 
remembered that the sole business of judgment is 
_ to perceive relations, and that an outline is the ex- 
pression of the relations between concepts.
-P-A-G-E-179
  
OPERATIONS OF THE MIND: ACQUISITION. 179 
RETENTION. 
Retention is the last step in acquisition, since without 
it no acquisition would be permanent. The faculty is 
memory, which has been discussed already. A few 
more words may be added here by way of emphasis. 
Retention is directly proportioned to attention. 
Retention is directly proportioned to vividness of the 
concept. 
Retention, attention, and vividness are all directly 
proportioned to zxterest. 
Newness is one means of arousing interest, but it is 
too often overlooked that the mere fact of a thing 
being new does not necessarily arouse interest. There 
must be enough of the old (the already understood) in 
any new object or fact to afford the mind a fulcrum by 
which to lift it all into comprehension. 
Isolated, unrelated facts are difficult to remember, and 
usually are not worth remembering. It is quite essen- 
tial to good retention that concepts be grouped accord- 
ing to some resemblance or some logical arrangement. 
This is work for the judgment ; and it is certain that 
this faculty comes into exercise, in this and other ways, 
very early in the development of the mind. Such work 
of the logical faculty should be encouraged in children: 
it quickens interest, and so helps attention. 
Finally, since accurate definition gives clearness and 
distinctness — and so vividness — to a concept, defini- 
tion aids retention directly and strongly. These facts 
may be applied in everyday teaching in numerous ways, 
which the ingenuity of the teacher will constantly 
suggest.

CHAPTER XIV. 
CULTIVATION OF ACQUISITIVE FACULTIES. 
SINCE acquisition supplies the mind with all its 
materials for thought, all its elements for imaginative 
creation, all its data for intelligent action in everyday 
affairs, the schools (since they are supposed to give a 
preparation for actual life) should carefully develop and 
train the faculties engaged in the accumulation and 
storing of knowledge-material. 
The outward perceptives, the physical senses, besides 
supplying materials out of which all our fundamental 
The Senses Concepts are formed, furnish direct stimulus 
4esthetic. to the inner sense of the beautiful, the zs- 
thetic taste. Through the cultivated senses much of 
human enjoyment is gained. The cultivated eye drinks 
in the beauty of color and forms, the trained ear de- 
lights in music, the hand that has been taught to figure 
what the eye sees or the imagination creates ministers 
to refined pleasure. Enjoyment gained through the 
senses is just as human, just as legitimate, and may be 
just as pure, as that gained through what is called the 
“higher nature.” In fact, the normal moral nature is 
aroused and stimulated and developed, at first, almost 
wholly through the senses. The business of teachers, 
then,— whether they teach in the home, the school, 
the pulpit, or through the press, —is not to decry and 
degrade the pleasure gained through the senses, but to
-P-A-G-E-181
CULTIVATION OF ACQUISITIVE FACULTIES, 181 
train the mind to enjoy and appreciate the outward 
beauty of objects of sense and the deeper beauty which 
is only symbolized by this. Let children early learn 
to open wide every gateway of sense to the incoming 
of the beautiful. 
The judgment must be trained to the quick and ac- 
curate perception of resemblances and differences in 
the process of conception. It should be jyagmentin 
especially taught to discern resemblances of Acquisition. 
form and function, since the classifications of highest 
value in any realm of knowledge rest almost. solely 
upon these. 
Memory, the retentive faculty, must be developed so 
that it shall hold and recall what is valuable, and det the 
rest go. Memory should not be burdened wemory in 
with all that is learned. Many things not Acquisition. 
particularly worth remembering have to be learned in 
order to exemplify and illustrate, or show the logical 
connection of the things that must be remembered. 
Such subsidiary matters it is as well to forget, after the 
main facts are understood and associated in memory. 
Kindergartens and primary schools do their work 
in accordance with these principles; and the secondary 
schools, colleges, and universities are pretty generally 
coming under the influences which are determining the 
direction and method of the lower education. 
NATURE STUDY. 
One of the best means of cultivating the powers of 
acquisition is to be found in nature studies. And this 
does not mean that “nature” is to be brought into the 
schoolroom to be studied (though that can occasionally
-P-A-G-E-182
ee 
1 
182 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
be done with profit), but that the school should be 
directed or taken to nature outdoors. 
It is an important fact that in just the proportion 
that a method or means of right education is valuable 
and effective in skilled hands, in that proportion will it 
degenerate into wooden mechanism when improperly 
used. This may help to explain why there has been 
so much dreary nonsense taught under the names of 
object lessons, nature. studies, etc., when teachers and 
pupils have tried to study things taken out of nature 
and brought indoors. Much good may be derived 
from the classroom or indoor study of natural objects, 
but not before there has been much outdoor work done. 
The country teacher has opportunities far beyond 
the city teacher for cultivating an accurate observa- 
Gh tion and refined appreciation of nature. Let 
ties of the Him go with his school into the fields and 
eee. woods that stretch before his schoolhouse 
door, and there see all he can himself, and 
get the pupils to see all they can. Let him strive to 
open their senses to the riches of light and color and 
form and sound all about them. Let him, by deft 
questioning, stimulate them to observe, compare, and 
classify leaves, stones, trees, flowers, insects, —all things, 
animate and inanimate, that are found,—even if the 
classification extends no further than to properly pla- 
cing the objects in the mineral, vegetable, or animal 
kingdom. Even if the teacher knows nothing of 
botany, or mineralogy, or zodlogy, he can have leaves 
classified as oval, or spear-shaped, or cordate, or round ;, 
as acute or obtuse; as toothed, divided, or entire. He 
can show that some flowers have five petals, some 
three, some none; that some plants have stems and 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
CULTIVATION OF ACQUISITIVE FACULTIES. 183 
fibrous roots, while others are stemless and have bulb- 
ous roots. He can get his pupils interested to find 
the first flower in the spring, and the last one in the 
autumn; to note those trees and shrubs that flower 
before leafing; to observe how the buds are covered 
in autumn, and how they unfold in spring. He can 
show the differences between sand and clay, between 
limestone and sandstone, and (according to location) 
granite and marble. He can point out the form char- 
acteristics of insects, reptiles, and higher animals, and 
interest his pupils in studying their habits. The teacher 
should also get his pupils to observe and record the 
weather conditions. One pupil can be detailed to read 
the thermometer at stated periods every day; another, 
to note the direction of the wind; another, to observe 
the sky, noting the character and extent of the cloudi- 
ness; andsoon. All the pupils should make daily ob- 
servations at the same time, carefully record them, and 
compare the results with the records of those specially 
appointed. All should be particularly instructed to 
note and ¢es¢ all local traditional weather signs. Much 
superstitious nonsense can thus be cleared away, while 
the young people are being taught to observe and 
record accurately. 
All these, and hundreds of other things that these 
may suggest, the teacher can do, with but a little exer- 
cise of his own powers of observing and judging, and a 
little reading of any of the excellent elementary books 
on science that are now so numerous. And how the 
powers of his pupils to perceive and compare and clas- 
sify will grow under such stimulating direction! A 
new world will be opened to both teacher and pupils. 
Some objects may be brought back from these little

observation tours to serve as drawing models; others, 
to be neatly labeled, and grouped in a cabinet. All 
the acquisitive faculties will be brought into play by 
such simple exercises, and every study will reveal the 
quickened intellectual impulse. Time will be gained, 
for all study will be done with greater interest and zeal. 
In childhood the acquisitive powers are most active, 
and hence children should be brought into such inti- 
mate and appreciative contact with nature that the 
impress upon the mind may be deep and lasting. The 
need of such training of the senses is admirably set 
forth in the following quotation from Powell, himself 
one of the keenest observers of nature: “There is ab- 
solutely nothing in our common school culture to make 
a child familiar with the earth, the soil, the forces, the 
life, animal or vegetable, that he must as a farmer deal 
with. There is no cause for wonder that the drift of 
our population is away from farms into cities. That 
which makes soil culture delightful is familiarity with 
the chemistry and biology that surround us. To be 
ignorant of the stones and ‘the clays, not even to com- 
prehend the simplest operations of nature about us, is 
to deaden farm life beyond endurance.” 
OBJECT TEACHING. 
But there are numerous indoor exercises for training 
the perceptives of pupils, — exercises upon the weight, 
shape, size, surface, origin, and use of common things. 
Geometrical forms (triangles, squares, circles, cubes, 
cylinders, etc.); the qualities and uses and origin of 
coal, wood, glass, chalk, iron,—these and many other 
such things afford abundant and excellent material for 
perception and conception, and will arouse and hold  
-P-A-G-E-185
  
CULTIVATION OF ACQUISITIVE FACULTIES. 185 
the interest of any child. Time may be saved, because 
interest will be intensified, by setting aside a few min- 
utes daily to ask and answer such questions as these: — 
What is horn? Where ts tt obtained ? 
What is glass ? 
What things in common use are dug out of the ground ? 
What foods are obtained from trees ? 
What common articles are made of glass? Of tron? 
Of wood? Of clay? 
What ts soil? How is it made ? 
What is frost? Rain? Fog? Ice? 
This work can be done in the primary grades in 
“conversation exercises,” or it may be presented in 
interesting morning talks to the whole school.’ In 
either case, mechanical formalism must be carefully 
avoided. 
In connection with the work suggested above, draw- 
ing and modeling can be used, and should be used, in 
both country and town schools. Such exercisesas these, 
though they are not provided for in the regular curric- 
ula of many primary schools outside the larger towns, 
and though in many instances they would be opposed 
by ignorant Boards and parents, may nevertheless be 
used in some form or other, with more or less frequency, 
by an ingenious teacher in any school. 
REGULAR BRANCHES. 
In addition to these exercises which lie outside the 
usual work of the average school, there are several 
studies which are in the list of “required branches” 
that are especially suited to the cultivation of the ac- 
quisitive powers. These are reading, spelling, geog- 
raphy, physiology. Of course, the beginnings of any  
-P-A-G-E-186

subject furnish more material for acquisition than for 
any other operation of the mind; but those just named 
do so, throughout both the primary and advanced work 
in them, in a greater degree than the other branches. 
Reading, properly taught, may be made to cultivate 
almost every faculty of the human mind. It is more 
important than any other branch, or— it 
might not be too much to say—than all 
other branches taught in the common schools. /¢ zs 
the key to all stored knowledge. It cultivates the powers 
of acquisition from the first word the child reads, through 
a lifetime of mental growth. The child beginning to 
read puts forth acquisitive effort upon each new word 
met with; and the form of the word, its pronunciation, 
and its meaning, become objects of perception, concep- 
tion, and retention. When word forms are sufficiently 
well mastered to enable the pupil to give his thought 
to the meanings of words rather than to their forms, 
then reading is a means to the limitless acquisition of 
new concepts. , 
To quicken interest, develop memory, and to intro- 
duce the pupil to a-wider range of facts than the regu- 
SUphte: lar reading lessons offer, two lines of supple- 
mentary mentary work are excellent,— one, reading 
Reading- from the various nature books, geographi- 
cal readers, etc., now so abundant; the other, learning 
by heart choice selections of the best poetry and prose 
within the comprehension of the pupil. The acquisi- 
tion of real gems of literature in this way is especially 
desirable. What is learned of good literature in early 
childhood will prove of the highest value in later liter- 
ary culture. Thoughts, words, and modes of expres- 
sion, learned while the mind is highly acquisitive, help Reading. 
 
-P-A-G-E-187

to mold the thought and speech of the individual all 
through life. 
Spelling is a memory study, and affords exercise for 
the visual, auditory, and muscular senses. The child 
learns to spell best through the eye, by ob- 
serving the relative positions of the letters in 
words as he sees them. But by writing words often, 
the muscular effort, associated with the eye impressions, 
helps to fix the form in memory. There should be 
much written spelling in every school. 
Each lesson should be made a spelling lesson, the 
pupil understanding that he may be called on to spell 
any word in any lesson. This training will quicken 
and sharpen-observation and retention of word forms. 
Oral spelling is useful mainly in training the ear to 
correct sounds of letters. It should be used with that 
purpose constantly in view. Oral spelling has but little 
use except to aid the pupil in acquiring correct enun- 
ciation and pronunciation. If oral spelling exercises 
are not directed to these ends, they are of little use. 
Geography, if taught solely from a text-book (as it 
almost universally is, even in primary schools), is almost 
wholly a memory study, affording material 
mainly for the retentive faculty. As usually 
taught, it affords cultivation only incidentally for imagi- 
nation, and almost not at all for observation. But since, 
in the case of children, ready-made concepts are worth 
little or nothing, it will be found that geography is best 
taught odjectively. The class should be taken out- 
doors often, and be shown watersheds, the formation of 
streams, islands, deltas, capes, etc. Any stream, or even 
the street or the “big road” after a shower, will furnish 
proper material for such observation lessons. Spelling. 
Geography.
-P-A-G-E-188
    188 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION, 
In mathematical geography, observation should be 
trained by use of a globe or ball; in political geogra- 
phy, by use of maps and by map drawing; in economic 
and physical geography, by making relief maps, with 
actual products placed upon them. All this is trite 
enough, and has been said numberless times by num- 
berless writers and speakers on educational subjects; 
but it will bear repeating and re-repeating until a ma- 
jority of teachers act upon the psychological principle 
involved, — that concepts are best gained by children 
through percepts, and these are gained through the 
Senses. 
What has been said of geography as an acquisition 
study may be said with equal force of physiology. The 
pupils themselves, their daily habits and ac- 
tivities, are the best apparatus for teaching 
physiology in the primary schools. The study of physi- 
ology involves mainly the faculties of observation and 
retention; and, if proper opportunity and stimulus be 
given for observation, memory will readily retain the 
percepts and concepts acquired. Material for the study 
of muscle, nerve, and bone, may be had in the pupils’ 
lunch baskets; that for the study of other structures — 
joints, lungs and trachea, heart, etc. — may be secured 
from any meat shop, or in the country when the win- 
ter’s killing is being done. The pupils themselves fur- 
nish the best means of illustrating human anatomy and 
physiology. No text-book is needed for the success- 
ful teaching of physiology in primary grades; but, if 
one is used, its statements should be verified and illus- 
trated by what the pupils can perceive of their own 
organism, and by their own good or bad habits of eat- 
ing, sleeping, breathing, sitting, etc. Physiology.

CULTIVATION OF ACQUISITIVE FACULTIES. 189 
ELEMENTS OF ALL BRANCHES. 
Formal teaching in school should not begin in the 
case of children, as a rule, until they are seven years 
old. This is true because formal teaching should not 
begin until there is a large store of percepts and con. 
cepts ready in the child’s mind to be used by the 
teacher. The child enters school with the elements of 
all knowledge already acquired: it remains for the 
teacher to ascertain, in each individual case, how ex- 
tensive this stock of knowledge is, and Zo use it as a@ 
basis for all further acquisition. The concepts the 
child has already acquired before coming to school are 
quite different from those he is expected to acquire 
during his first days at school. By all means, this 
difference should be reduced to a minimum. Con- 
cepts familiar to the child must be used to explain and 
illustrate new concepts: the zew must ever be inter- 
preted in terms of the familiar. 
A new subject or a new lesson should be introduced 
by a sound drill upon the meanings and uses of the 
unfamiliar terms involved. Attention is to be directed 
to new words in the next reading lesson; to plus, add, 
sum, etc., when addition is begun; to zouns as names 
with which the pupil is already familiar, etc. General 
definitions and rules should be ventured upon only 
when the teacher is sure, from many and varied tests, 
that the pupil 2uows the thing to be defined, or the 
process to be described. ° No commoner or more vicious 
blunder is made in teaching than to give words before 
things, rules before processes. 
Each study has its own terms, more or less technical, 
its own principles, and its own peculiar set of new ideas.  
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
Such of these as are fundamental must be mastered by 
the pupil. He must acquire them, form the proper 
concepts, and hold them in memory ready for prompt 
recall when needed. 
What? When? Where? —these three are preémi- 
nently the “questions of acquisition,’ and should be 
used to exercise the pupil’s power to perceive, to form 
concepts, to define, and to remember. The teaching 
teacher will devise many means of so stimulating the 
curiosity of the pupils that they will often and perti- 
nently ask these questions of the teacher and of them- 
selves. What is it, where is it, whence is it, in nature 
study and object drills; what is it, in reading and 
spelling; what is it and when was it, in history, — this 
will serve as a hint of how such questions may be con- 
stantly and profitably used in acquisition exercises and 
studies.

ASSIMILATION: CONCEPTION, REASONING. 19} 
CHAPTER XV. 
ASSIMILATION: CONCEPTION, REASONING. 
ASSIMILATION may be defined in its narrower sense 
as the operation of the faculty of judgment in perceiv- 
ing and formulating relations: (1) relations General 
of percepts, (2) relations of concepts, and (3) Pefnition. 
_the relations of these relations. But there is a broader 
sense in which the term assimilation may be used. It 
means self-building, and so includes those processes 
which produce character. Just as physical assimilation 
of food produces new muscle and bone and nerve fiber, 
so mental assimilation results in new thoughts, new 
ideals, new purposes,—a more vigorous intellectual and 
moral growth. 
\ CONCEPTION. 
Of assimilation in this sense, conception (often called 
now apperception) is the first step. The process of con- 
ception is assimilative, because it is essentially a pro. 
cess of likening newly observed phenomena, whether 
objective or subjective, to one another, and to some 
part of our body of knowledge already gathered, — of 
fitting them into their places as determined by resem- 
blances to what we already know. Conception is the 
connecting process between acquisition and assimila- 
tion: it is the chief process in acquisition, the most 
elementary in assimilation. It has received considera- 
tion in Chapter XIII.  
-P-A-G-E-192
  192 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
REASONING. 
The next process in assimilation is reasoning, which 
may be formally defined as that process by which we 
reach conclusions. The faculty concerned in the essen- 
tial act of reasoning is judgment, but it makes use of 
all that the other faculties can supply. Through per- 
ception and conception the “raw materials” of our 
conclusions are collected. Imagination frames other 
possible concepts and relations; and judgment selects, 
compares, discriminates, combines, and concludes. 
Since our business, our politics, our religion, our daily 
conduct in all lines of activity in which we may be en- 
gaged, are based on our conclusions, it is evident that 
the habit of reasoning rapidly and accurately should be 
formed early and thoroughly. 
The perception and formulation of relations between 
concepts was presented in one of its phases in “Out- 
lining.” Another phase is the formulation of proposz- 
tions; as, “Man is an animal,” “Snow is white,” “Ac- 
tivity is delightful.” Such formulated propositions are 
Kinds of usually called judgments, taking the name 
Judgments. from the faculty. Logicians name several 
kinds of judgments, —affirmative, negative, analytic, 
synthetic, singular, universal, implicit. 
An affirmative judgment is based on a perception of 
likeness or identity, and declares something to be so; 
as, “Mind is a growth.” 
A negative judgment is based on the perception of 
difference, and declares something not to be so; as, 
“ Memorizing is not learning.” 
An analytic judgment affirms the relations of parts 
to parts, or of parts to a whole separable into these
-P-A-G-E-193
  ASSIMILATION : REASONING. 193 
parts. It proceeds from wholes to parts. The analysis 
of a sentence is a good example 
A synthetic judgment affirms the relations of parts 
to parts as composing and completing the whole. It 
proceeds from partsto wholes. Parsing, properly done, 
is a fair example, the several words being described in 
their relation to the whole sentence. To say that 
oxygen and hydrogen compose water is to express a 
synthetic judgment. The classification of individuals 
into species, species into families, families into orders, 
etc., in botany and zoélogy, affords another illustration. 
Judgment is at work synthetically also when it is 
generalizing, — going from particulars to wholes, as in 
inductive reasoning. 
A singular judgment is one that affirms or davies 
something of a single thing, an individual; as, “This 
man is ill.” 
A universal judgment is one that affirms or denies 
something of a whole class of things; as, “All men are 
liars.” 
An implicit judgment is an unconscious, or at least 
unformulated, perception of relation. If I think or 
say, “This isan apple,” I implicitly affirm, “ This object 
is like other objects called apples, and is therefore to 
be named apple.” 
The natural tendency of the mind, in child or adult, 
is first in the direction of affirmative and universal 
judgments; that is, the mind naturally first seeks re- 
semblances, and affirmative judgments are based upon 
these. And although the child must for some time 
make individual judgments, yet, as experience widens, 
he is, by natural tendency, prone to make affirmations 
that are widely general. The mind is always desirous

194 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
of reaching conclusions of the widest possible applica- 
* bility. : 
The comparison of two or more judgments or propo- 
sitions, perceiving their relations, and formulating these 
relations into another proposition, is the form 
of reasoning called deduction. The formal 
expression of an argument in this kind of reasoning is 
a syllogism or series of syllogisms. A syllogism fully, 
expressed is made up of three propositions. To illus. 
trate :— Deduction. 
All sheep are woolly, 
This animal is a sheep, 
Therefore this animal is woolly. 
This will serve as a fair specimen of the syllogism 
as usually presented. 
The first and second propositions of a syllogism are 
called premises, the third, the conclusion. Each of the 
three is a statement of a perceived relation, and is 
therefore the result of an act of judging. In the ex- 
ample given, the first proposition is the statement of a 
relation between sheep and woolliness; the second, of a 
yelation between a cértain animal and the class called 
sheep, the third is a statement of a relation between 
the two relations stated in the first and second. 
An enthymeme is a syllogism with one of its premises 
suppressed ; as, “She will talk, being a woman.” The 
The Enthy- Major premise, “All women will talk,” is sup- 
meme: pressed, 
It is hardly necessary to say that the regular syllo- 
gism is not used in practical deductive reasoning. Most 
of even formal arguments are expressed in enthymemes. 
One can become a lucid and exact reasoner without

ever having seen a syllogism; and it is somewhat 
doubtful whether a knowledge of formal logic is an 
aid in a real search for truth. What has so far been 
said of deduction is rather by way of warning, that the 
teacher may avoid formalism. Another form 
or method of reasoning is called zzduction. 
_Deduction means drawing down from, drawing out 
a conclusion from general or individual propositions 
already stated. Induction means drawing in a con- 
clusion into a number of related facts, thus correlating 
them, and bringing them under a general law. Deduc- 
tion is making a special application of some general 
principle or fact, as in the syllogism on p. 194. Induc- 
tion is generalizing from a number of particular cases 
to a general principle applying to all of them and to all 
like them. 
We observe the absence of upper incisors in this cow, 
in that one, and in others, and draw the conclusion that 
“all cows lack the upper incisors.’ We find from 
observation that heat expands iron and gold and plati- 
num: we conclude that “heat expands all metals.” 
The three chief aids to correct induction are expert- Induction. 
ence, observation, experimentation. Experience is the

servation is taking careful note of facts that Induction. 
occur in the everyday course of nature; experimenta- 
tion is causing things to occur in a certain order or 
relation, under given conditions, and noting the results. 
Sociology (history and civics) as a science is made up 
of inductions from experience; geography, geology, 
biology and its subdivisions, are built on inductions 
from observation, physics and chemistry are preémi- 
nently the experimental sciences.
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
All three methods of induction may be applied in a 
study of the science and art of education. At first, 
teaching was purely a matter of experience, an empiri- 
cal calling; then it became observational, the teacher 
taking intelligent note of the results of his own methods 
and of the methods of others; now many experiments 
in education are being carefully tried everywhere and 
the results recorded. Upon these three pillars — expe- 
rience, observation,*experimentation —the true science 
of education will rest. 
The grandest generalizations in science, the most 
splendid discoveries of natural law, have been made 
valueof through induction. The laws of gravitation, 
Induction. the nebular hypothesis, the evolutionary hy- 
pothesis, — these are illustrations of what the patient 
accumulation of facts and the persistent seeking-out and 
formulating of their relations have accomplished. The 
universality of law is another of the great scientific in- 
ductions. It embodies the truths that all phenomena 
happen in accord with fixed laws, and that the same 
kinds of phenomena are governed by similar laws. 
Upon this generalization rest many other scientific 
truths and theories. Approximate proof of the uni- 
versality of law could not have been arrived at through 
deduction, for there was nothing to deduce from. It was 
reached only through wide and intelligent observation 
of natural phenomena of every kind. 
The theory of the conservation and correlation of 
energy is another example of induction of the highest 
order. The discovery that all forces may be changed 
into one another—that electricity may be converted 
into heat or into light, that gravitation may be con- 
verted into heat or electricity, etc, — could have been 
   
-P-A-G-E-197
  
ASSIMILATION: REASONING. 197 
made only by observation and experience of a large 
number of such transformations, supplemented by care- 
ful and exact experimentation. 
In the common affairs of life, induction is as much 
used, and is as important, as in the widest ranges of 
scientific investigation, and its methods are the same. 
When we say such a man is not to be trusted, such a 
business method is sure to result disastrously, or such 
- aline of conduct is immoral, we simply announce special 
applications of the conclusions we have zniuctively 
reached. ; 
Induction builds a broader basis for our individual 
and social morality. The establishment of our ethical 
relations to the lower animals; the duties of society to 
the unemployed, the incompetent, and the weak; the 
principles upon which social reforms are being worked 
out,—all are arrived at, tested, and corrected through 
induction. 
It is easy to show that all reasoning is based upon 
induction. Take, as illustration, geometry, which may 
fairly be considered sufficiently abstract to : 
serve as a test — unless we put mathematical ae 
reasoning in a class by itself, as Hopkins Pe 
does. The method of argument in geometry : 
runs as follows, if carried out in full: the sum of all the 
angles of this triangle is two right angles; this is true 
of a second and third triangle, and of all triangles that 
have been seen. Therefore, since these represent all 
possible triangles, the sum of the angles of any triangle 
is two right angles. 
In any form of the syllogism (the formal instrument: 
of the deductive method), the value of a conclusion 
depends solely upon the truth of the premises. Of the 
t
-P-A-G-E-198
198 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
truth of the premises we can have no evidence whatever, 
as a rule, except through induction. 
In the syllogism, “ All cows lack upper incisors, this 
animal is a cow, therefore it lacks upper incisors,” the 
first premise rests wholly on zzduction, and cannot pos. 
sibly be reached by deduction. It is not intended to 
say that deduction is not of high value; but it is 
intended to say that deduction is of value in direct 
proportion to the thoroughness of the induction which 
must in every case precede it, and establish its premises. 
Through the laws of gravitation reached by inductive 
processes, the existence and position of heavenly bodies, 
unknown before the discovery of these laws, have been 
accurately deduced. But it is plain that it would be 
utterly impossible to make such deductions were it not 
for the previous induction. The relative methods and 
values of the two forms of reasoning may be summed 
up as follows:— 
Induction proceeds from particular cases to the gen- 
eral laws or principles governing all such cases. It is 
aided by observation, experience, and experimentation. 
It furnishes the materials and the general rules for the 
solution of special problems which may present them- 
selves in everyday life. “The method, rightly under- 
stood and practiced, leads straight to truth. It is the 
patient, candid, impartial, universal method of modern 
science.” 
Deduction proceeds from generals to particulars: it 
draws out of the general principle an application to, or 
explanation of, a given special case. It is the method of 
fitting our experiences to the requirements of our every- 
day lives, and to the puzzling questions that arise for 
settlement in business, politics, or ethics. 
   
-P-A-G-E-199
  
  ASSIMILATION : REASONING. 199 
The error we need to guard against most, in reach- 
mg conclusions, is generalizing from insufficient data, 
which means jumping at conclusions before asty 
enough facts are known. The human mind _ Generali- 
has a strong natural tendency, especially “*“°"* 
observable in the young and in the untrained, to formu- 
late general truths, to reach working rules of action, be- 
fore enough particular cases have been noted to justify 
a conclusion. This tendency needs restraining and 
directing, and careful disciplining. The desire to formu- 
late general truth, mingled with the taint of superstition 
which is inherent in every human mind, leads to such 
absurd beliefs as that the moon’s phases affect the shin- 
gles of a roof, the making of soap, or the planting of 
seeds; that ill luck follows carrying a hoe through the 
house, or breaking a mirror, or spilling salt, etc. There 
is no more profitable thing the teacher can do than to 
help explode these beliefs, by having his older pupils 
keep careful record of actual results as observed by 
themselves. Besides showing the absurdity of these 
prevalent superstitions, such a plan would greatly stimu- 
late the ability and desire of the pupils to collate facts, 
and to draw their own conclusions. 
Cultivating the Power to Reason. 
Correct reasoning (correct judging) depends upon 
careful and accurate observation and accumulation of 
all facts that may have a bearing upon the matter in 
hand, and upon the power to perceive quickly and cor- 
rectly the true relations of the facts. 
Teachers should train their pupils to observe intelli- 
gently, and with interest wide awake, all facts that 
come in their way. Then, with the questions Why ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  200 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
and How? (preéminently assimilation questions, as 
What? When? Where? are acquisition questions,) 
young minds, already on edge with curiosity, may be 
led to discern relations accurately and to draw conclu- 
sions correctly. Nothing is more needed in the practi- 
cal life of to-day than the power to face facts, and rea- 
son upon them. It is due to the neglect of cultivating 
the power to reason inductively —a neglect too preva- 
lent still in formal education, from the primary school 
to the university —that the master of arts is not always, 
by any means, master of the situation. 
There are two obstacles to the proper training of the 
reasoning faculty (judgment) in schools. One is the 
habit, fixed upon so many teachers, of slav- 
ishly following the text-book instead of draw- 
ing largely upon the practical experiences of everyday 
life outside the schoolroom for teaching material. The 
other is the tendency of both teachers and pupils, in 
their hurry to cover a certain number of lessons in a 
given time, to make “ getting a lesson” mean commit- 
ting it to memory, whether it be understood or not. 
Memorizing is quick and easy: thinking out and telling 
why and how are hard. Speaking of the practice of 
memorizing (rather than reasoning upon) the facts in 
different studies, President Eliot forcibly says, “ No 
amount of such studies will protect one from believing 
in astrology or theosophy. . . . One is fortified 
against the acceptance of unreasonable propositions 
only by skill in determining facts through observation 
and experience, by practice in comparing facts or groups 
of facts, and by the unvarying habit of questioning and 
verifying allegations, and of distinguishing between 
facts and inferences from facts.” Obstacles.

There are many exercises, both in and out of the text- 
books, that may be used to develop and train the judg- 
ment, even of children. Here, as in cultivat- 4, o¢ 
ing the acquisitive powers, the best material common 
will be found in common things. To too 78* 
many teachers common things are commonplace, but not 
so to the child; not at least until he has gone to school 
long enough to have his intelligent curiosity repressed 
and blunted. The child begins early to ask why and 
how; and the teacher should take the hint, ask these 
questions often of the pupils, and direct their use of 
them. A few minutes each day, or less often, as time 
allows, can be used to no better purpose than to quicken 
the child’s curiosity, and his power to investigate, give 
reasons, and draw conclusions, by questions 
upon common facts, and later by simple ex- 
periments with common things. A few illustrations 
may be suggestive : — 
Why do we light a fire from the bottom ? 
What would happen if ice were heavier than water ? 
Why are wheat stems hollow ? 
Why does water flow down hill ? 
Why does a lamp smoke when the top of the chimney 
ts covered ? 
Why does not wood sink ? 
How ts a nail held in wood ? 
Why does rain fall in drops ? 
Why ts there no hoarfrost on a cloudy night ? 
What causes the moisture on the outside of a vessel of 
cold water on a warm day ? 
Why can we see the breath in winter, and not in sum- 
mer ?

simplest nature, should often be performed by the pu- 
pils themselves, and should quicken perception as well 
as judgment. Only one or two examples of such 
experiments need be given here: the ingenuity of the 
teacher will suggest many more. 
On some cool day, when the schoolroom is heated, 
open the door to a crack about an inch wide. Hold a 
lighted match or bit of burning paper near the crack, 
at the top, while a pupil holds a similar light near the 
bottom. Have the pupils note the directions in which 
the flames are turned, —one in, the other out. Why? 
Fill a glass with water to the brim. About a half 
pound of small nails can be dropped into it slowly 
without running the water over. Why? , 
The text-book branches specially adapted to culti- 
vating the reflective power are arithmetic, grammar, 
Reflective @dvanced history, and civics. The greatest 
Studies. stress has usually been laid on arithmetic for 
this purpose, but it is not the best study for training 
judgment. Successful practical living requires a judg- 
ment trained to infer correctly from probabilities ; 
arithmetic cultivates the power only to reason from 
certainties to certainties. The same is true of mathe- 
matics from arithmetic up. 
The study of arithmetic may all too easily become a 
memory-cramming, answer-getting mechanism. No 
training for judgment can be found in arith- 
metic unless a careful distinction be made, in 
the statement of every problem, between the quanti- 
ties given and those reguired ; and unless every step 
in the solution is logically based on a previous step, 
or on one or more of the given conditions: hence the 
necessity for much oral work in arithmetic, and for re- Arithmetic.

quiring pupils to follow a /ogical form in their written 
solutions. At every step in arithmetic, “ Why is this 
true?” and “ How was that obtained?” should be asked 
by the teacher, until telling the why and how becomes 
a fixed habit in the pupil. Of course, processes should 
be taught before rules, and answers should be often 
verified. 
Grammar is especially adapted to the cultivation of 
the reflective faculty in pupils old enough to use a text- 
book in the study of that subject. Tech- 
nical grammar is elementary logic. Diagram- 
ing and parsing, which are coming again into favor as 
school exercises, and which should never have gone 
out, cannot be done correctly unless the meaning of 
the sentence be grasped; and this cannot be done un- 
less the true relations of the words and phrases to the 
concepts they name, and to one another, be clearly 
seen. If this could be kept in view in all teaching of 
technical grammar, the work could never degenerate 
into a parsing grind. There is more valuable discipline 
for the relational faculty in thorough drill in diagram- 
ing and analyzing the English sentence than in arith- 
metical analysis. 
History and civics, from the time they may be profit- 
ably taught from text-books, are of the highest prac- 
tical value in the education of judgment.  pistory

ing questions that stimulate the reflective power of 
the pupils. To teach history without training the 
judgment of the pupil is merely to stuff his memory 
with valueless facts, — valueless, because their relations 
are not perceived, their causes are not understood. 
Tf it is true that no fact is of value in itself, standing Grammar,

unrelated with other facts, it is especially true in his- 
tory. The facts of human civilization, of the origin 
and growth of those things that we call government 
and religion and liberty and science and art,—these 
are the facts of supremest value to every citizen, 
whether young or old; but they are valuable only as 
they are related to one another and to our own insti- 
tutions. It will not do to merely zustruct boys and 
girls in the facts of history, on the supposition that 
they will learn of themselves to correlate and explain 
these facts as judgment grows more mature. The 
pupil must be taught to ¢hizk from the start, if he 
is to do much good thinking later in life. The facts 
imparted must be, in number ‘and kind, suited to the 
advancement of the pupil; and he should be led to 
seek for and find, with the teacher’s aid, the causes of 
events. It is well to take some time from fact-get- 
ting to investigate with classes in United States history 
and civics such questions as:— 
Why are the North American red men called Indians? 
Why has Rhode Island two capitals ? 
Why was the government under the Articles of Con- 
federation a failure ? . 
Why did not the North continue to own slaves as long 
as the South did ? 
Why should each State have two senators in Congress ? 
Would a republican form of government be good for 
every country ? 
Why was the “ Monroe Doctrine” proclaimed ? 
Why do the New England States have so many manu- 
facturing industries ? 
Why do more railroads run east and west than run 
north and south ?

Ts it wise to elect judicial officers ? 
Are parties essential to good government ? 
Why do the United States have a flag ? 
While the studies above mentioned are especially 
suited to cultivate the thought powers, any study may 
be made to do so if taught by the zzductive method. 
Get the pupil to observe and study facts and processes, 
and then to make his own definitions and rules. 
It will bear repeating, that the conclusions which we 
look upon as most valuable, and upon which our daily 
actions in any line of work are based, are drawn by 
induction either directly or indirectly from accumulated 
experience. Then, if the man or woman is expected to 
be independent and self-reliant, to think clearly and 
decide wisely, the boy or girl must be trained to accu- 
rate observation of facts, and to judicial reflection upon 
their relations and bearings. 
Definitions and rules, in life as in grammar, in morals 
as in mathematics, are but the generalizations of many 
particulars; and as the student of arithmetic cannot 
work independently until he can generalize his own 
rules out of familiar processes, so the citizen cannot be 
' independent in character and living until he can gen- 
eralize his rules of conduct out of the experiences of 
human life.

CHAPTER XVI. 
ASSIMILATION : IMAGINING. 
In Chapter IX. the distinction between memory and 
imagination, and the functions and value of the latter 
faculty, were presented at some length. In this chap- 
ter it is proposed to attend more to the processes of 
constructive or creative imagining, as involved in assimi- 
lation, and to the proper cultivation of the faculty. 
Assimilation was defined in its broadest sense as self 
building, not only making new experiences fit in with 
those already gained, but combining all so as to create 
new thought, new purpose, new character. The work 
of imagination in this is indispensable. Even acqui- 
sition is slow and laborious for the child or man deficient 
in imagination; and proper assimilation is still more 
difficult for the mind which lacks combining and cre- 
ative power. 
The materials which imagination uses in its work are 
percepts and concepts furnished by memory, or those 
Materiais "OW being formed in consciousness, or all 
of together. The’ creative faculty may take 
Imagining. something from the accumulated store of 
knowledge, or it may use what is now being presented 
through the senses, or concepts as they are formed, or 
all these, from which to make its combinations. The 
chance notes that float in upon a Mozart’s ear may serve 
as a nucleus around which the musical imagination will

build a symphony ; the passing flash of color may be just 
the stimulus needed to arouse the activity of the artist’s 
imagination ; the transient pose of some graceful figure 
may furnish the image needed by the sculptor to round 
into perfect symmetry the form he is creating. Some 
chance remembrance, some reawakened train of associ- 
ation, may be what is needed to start into action the 
creative energy of the poet or the scientific investigator. 
As has already been seen, no faculty works alone and 
independent of the others. Imagination needs and 
receives the aid of the senses, memory, Judg-  orece of 
ment, the feelings, and will. The process of _ other 
imagining, in which imagination is of course **™'** 
the chief actor and the other faculties subordinates, is 
approximately as follows: The perceptives and memory 
furnish the materials,— percepts and concepts ; judg- 
ment examines and selects such as seem suitable to the 
work in hand; and imagination combines, submitting 
the result to judgment for final decision. Will directs 
the whole process, — commands memory to bring forth 
its store of appropriate material; orders judgment to 
select what is needed, and to decide upon the results; 
and sets imagination to the task of modifying and com- 
bining. The coworking of the several faculties, in 
imagining, may be illustrated by particular examples. 
The merchant takes stock of his experiences, select- 
ing such as have a more or less direct bearing upon his 
present conditions. Between these selected experiences 
and the present requirements of his business, imagina- 
tion forms combinations which picture possible improve- 
ments, a better organization of his subordinates, more 
attractive methods of advertising, and an increase of 
trade.
-P-A-G-E-208

' Each plan suggested is carefully tested by his judg- 
ment, modified somewhat in detail, finally pronounced 
good, and put into practice; or is found wanting, and 
rejected. / 
At this writing, Professor Langley, of the Smithso- 
nian Institution, is at work upon a flying machine. 
His perception of the flight of birds, and his ‘knowl- 
edge (memory) of what has been attempted in aérial 
navigation, furnished him with the elements. Judg- 
ment selected such.as it deemed most usable under the 
given conditions of weight, speed, and dirigibility; and 
out of these his inventive imagination created an ideal, 
to which he is making the machine now under con- 
struction more or less closely approximate. A model 
must have been in his mind before he could have begun 
even to draw the plans of his structure. 
The geologist, not content with mere observation of 
rock and stream and glacial marking, seeks to construct 
a theory that shall reach into the endless past of geo- 
logic time, and group and harmonize and unify all 
known facts, and make the wrinkled surface of earth a 
page to be read by those who would know its message. 
He makes many possible combinations of observed 
facts, tries to explain them in terms of present phe- 
nomena, and so, piece by piece, builds up an earth 
history. Such work requires creative power of a high 
order. There is but one Lyell, or Dana, or Geikie, to 
thousands of fact collectors. 
The architects and artists who created the Columbian 
buildings drew upon every resource of memory or pres- 
ent perception of form and color for possible elements 
of new combinations. Judgment selected such as were 
harmonious, or capable of being made so, with one

ASSIMILATION: IMAGINING. 209 
another and with the ideal structures and color effects 
already dimly foreshadowed by imagination. Then 
the creative faculty grouped and unified these elements 
into the images which were afterward bodied forth in 
such grandeur of harmonious wholes, and in such beau- 
tiful execution of detail as compelled the esthetic 
approval of nations. 
Dickens, George Eliot, Carlyle, Lowell,—all the 
master weavers.of words, had abundant riches of obser- 
vation, experience, feeling, and reasoning. These were 
sifted, compared, combined, created into new relations, 
new meanings, new truth for the world. 
In these higher activities of imagination, which alone 
are usually called creative, the work of judgment and 
will seems to become unnecessary and to be suspended. 
It is only when the mind f/ods, when the faculties have 
to be driven to work, as they often must be, that we are 
able to trace their separate functions. But in the higher 
efforts of creative imagination it seems to work without 
other compulsion or direction than that of its own 
activity. In the white heat of genius the limitations 
of memory are melted away, judgment and imagina- 
tion become fused into one, and new created thought 
pours forth in a lambent stream over which will has no 
control. Genius is conscious of no steps or processes 
in creation; the fiat goes forth, “ Be,” and thought ts. 
All such work is in the highest degree assimilative : 
it is taking the crude material that comes into the 
mind through sensation, conception, and reasoning, and 
making it up into new thought, new ideals, that become 
an integral part of the character, in accordance with the 
character’s already formed tendencies and limitations. 
Just as assimilation in muscle, or bone, or nerve, is de-

termined by the cells already formed there, so mental 
assimilation is modified, if not determined, by the dent 
of the mind. The inventor could not create Becky 
Sharp: any more than Thackeray could have created an 
air ship; the musician could not create a nebular hypoth- 
esis any more than Laplace could have created one of 
Beethoven’s symphonies. The mind, like the cell, takes 
up what adds to the kind of ¢#sswe already formed. 
APPLICATIONS TO TEACHING. 
Some suggestion as to the help imagination may be 
to the teacher was made in Chapter IX. There em- 
the  Phasis was laid upon the sympathetic imagi- 
Teacher's nation, by which the teacher can feel as the 
Need. pupil feels, misunderstand as the pupil mis- 
uriderstands, and understand from the learner’s point 
of view. This is a sort of outward assimilation, in 
which the teacher assimilates himself to the pupil. But 
there is another sense in which this must be done, in 
effective teaching. The teacher, holding before him- 
self the image of the pupil’s limitations, and the actual 
amount and condition of his knowledge, must cast the 
facts to be presented to the pupil in such form as will 
assimilate them to what the learner already knows. 
The teacher must zmagine such combinations of con- 
cepts as will show them in relations that the pupil can 
comprehend. He must be all the time on the alert to 
invent illustrations and to make applications that will 
stimulate the combining and creative imagination of 
his students, thus enabling them not only to understand 
the matter presented, but to project it upon the screen 
of consciousness, and see it as a picture. 
The creative faculty manifests itself in children at a
-P-A-G-E-211
    ASSIMILATION: IMAGINING. 211 
very early age, and with a proportionately more intense 
activity than in adults. It manifests itself as early as 
the second year, and is well developed in the third and 
fourth years. A child of three and a half tmagination 
years of age has been observed to haul his in Children. 
toy wagon from point to point in the room, and draw 
imaginary milk for imaginary customers, and receive 
imaginary pay. The most marked manifestation of 
imagination in the very young child is in endowing 
inanimate objects with /fe and motion, the idea of the 
latter being of course aided by actually moving the 
objects. To the little girl, her rag doll is really alive, 
and cries or laughs, sleeps or walks, as a flesh-and- 
blood baby would. To the boy, his line of plain wooden 
blocks is a train of cars at full speed. 
The mechanically perfect toy is neither so pleasing 
nor So beautiful to the child as a piece of wood or bit 
ofiron. The perfect toy, that too accurately represents 
something, and “goes of itself,” leaves nothing to the 
imagination. This faculty, like all others, is naturally 
active, and its activity is enjoyable; therefore the child 
prefers to exercise it in imagining his shapeless bit of 
material to be by turns a fish, a cat, a wagon, or a 
steam engine. The boy or girl surfeited with tin bugs 
that crawl and real steam engines with a sure-enough 
whistle, or with a life-size doll that shuts its eyes and 
says “mamma,” is glad to turn away from these un- 
suggestive playthings, and delve into the old box full 
of broken toys, and find there abundant material for 
creative imagination to work with. The mechanically 
perfect toy /imits imagination by its very complete- 
ness: the bit of stick, or wire, or rag, or broken china, 
can be imagined into any number of forms and uses.
-P-A-G-E-212
  
  212 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
Not infrequently the child imagines so vividly, that . 
he accepts the products of his imagination as real, and 
insists upon the truth of some very startling statements. 
The exercise of a little judgment on the part of teacher 
or parent will make it plain that the child is not lying 
in any true sense of the word: he delzeves it all himself. 
From all that has been said of the uses of imagi- 
nation, it may readily be inferred that no faculty is 
Cultivation More deserving of development and training. 
ofImagina- There are many exercises and formal studies 
ton. all the way from the kindergarten to the uni- 
versity that are specially useful in the cultivation of 
the creative faculty. Clay modeling, paper cutting, 
weaving, etc., when done so as to allow freedom to the. 
originality of the child,-are directly helpful. Too fre- 
quently these exercises degenerate into mere copying. 
Even at the worst, though, the child’s imagination runs 
just ahead of his fingers or just beyond the points of 
the scissors, and patterns the work. The numerous kin- 
dergarten song games also are of great value in imagi- 
nation training. 
The exercises of the kindergarten should be con- 
tinued, with some modifications, into the primary grades, 
and drawing should be introduced. 
In addition, in these grades, the oral exercises and 
the reading should be carried on with special reference 
to their influence in developing imagination. The 
teacher may briefly describe some object not in sight, 
and have the pupils try to determine from her descrip- 
tion what the object is. Accounts of the doings of 
elves and brownies may be given by both teacher and 
little folks; trees, flowers, animals, may be endowed 
with speech, and made to give an account of themselves.
-P-A-G-E-213
  
ASSIMILATION : IMAGINING. 213 
In the simplest reading exercise there is room and 
also need for imagination,—the persons read of, and 
what they do, must be vitalized and made real, and the 
places and events described must be more or less fully 
pictured, if there is to be any real reading. This is as 
true of the first reading lesson as of the interpreta 
tion of Dante or Milton. Reading, let us say it again, 
is the one exercise which, more than any other, is capa- 
ble of calling into active use every power of the mind. 
It nourishes imagination as no other school study can. 
To read is to interpret,—to see the same scenes, to 
think the same thoughts, to feel the same motives, to 
will the, same purposes, as those we read of. Only 
' through imagination is it possible to do this. 
Much imaginative literature should be used in the 
schools from the third grade up. Hans Andersen, 
“sop, Crusoe, are classics. At the proper ee ees 
age, children should be made acquainted ana 
with the beautiful myths of Greece and aneusse- 
Rome. In childhood and youth these things can be 
thoroughly assimilated, and made an everlasting part 
of the literary culturé and refinement which is one of 
the most priceless things the student can take with him. 
Language lessons and composition should be used 
to call forth the creative activity of the mind. The 
reading lesson, a picture, the geography lesson, the un- 
folding of a flower, anything with a possible personal 
element of life and action in it, can be used as the 
basis of oral or written language exercises that shall 
necessitate purposive use of the imagination. 
The power to make combinations and to form images 
is highly serviceable in much of the work in arithmetic, 
and is indispensable in the higher mathematics. The  
-P-A-G-E-214
    
(214 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
need is not so much to see relations of numbers— 
judgment takes care of that—as to place the ddjects 
Mathe. Jefore the mind so their relations can be 
matics. readily perceived. In the simplest problem 
—‘“If James has five apples and his father gives him 
six more,” etc.—the child must be able to see James 
with the eleven apples. In arithmetical mensuration, 
in geometry and trigonometry, the need of imagina- 
tion grows more and more imperative. 
Other studies that especially cultivate imagination 
and call for its exercise are geography and history, 
including biography. The assimilative or 
apperceptive work of imagination’is con- 
stantly required in these two studies, whether primary 
or the most advanced. Such concepts as zsland, glacier, 
volcano, oasis, can be formed, and assimilated to the 
pupil’s present body of knowledge, only by an active 
creative faculty that can combine the simple elements 
of his experience into images of these things. The 
child who is prepared to undertake the study of primary 
geography has probably never seen a river or an island, 
and certainly not an oasis or a volcano; but he can 
create pretty accurate concepts of them for himself out 
of. his concepts of small streams, land, unproductive 
and productive soils, hills, and fire. 
To get anything out of history, the student must be 
able to put himself back into the time of which he 
reads, — must see the people, their modes of dress, the 
circumstances of their daily life; must feel 
their emotions and desires, their hopes and 
ambitions; must understand their arts and sciences; 
must make himself one of them,—before he can form 
any adequate idea of events or the relations and causes Geography. 
History.
-P-A-G-E-215
  ASSIMILATION: IMAGINING. 215 
of events in any given period. Young people can 
image these things with wonderful facility and fidelity, 
and will do so if only the teacher, in oral lessons or 
text-book drill, will supply the stimulus of interest, and 
set the material before the creative faculty in the right 
way. Still more is this true in the study of biography, 
for in this there is the powerful attractiveness of per- 
sonality. The history text-books intended for use in 
classes below the college freshman should 
contain a great deal of biography, and-should 
group “events about the lives and deeds -of eminent 
men and women. And even all the way through the 
college or university course, in other studies as well as 
in history, it is well to give imagination this element 
of the personal about which to group many of its com- 
binations. The history of the struggles and achieve- 
ments of great mathematicians, chemists, physicists, 
serves to intensify the creative power of other minds. 
It is mainly through its exercise in literature, history, 
and biography, that imagination builds the iu midhe 
moral character. In this building it has its | and 
highest function. Character depends upon: ?*"™****™ 
ideals, and ideals are the standards which imagination 
forms and sets before us as the measures of our con- 
duct. The materials out of which our ideals are formed 
we get from the lives of others around us, and from 
what we read. A great deal of ideal-making is uncon- 
scious; and the standard may be formed, and we may 
find ourselves working toward it, before we discover 
that it is not worth our endeavor. This emphasizes 
the need of proper environment for the young, —virtu- 
ous associates and correct literature. In much of the 
fiction of to-day the ideals are distorted and untrue and Biography.

often vicious. No book is safe that does not hold up 
sincere, honest, earnest character as the only kind worth 
building. The prevalent note in.much current litera- 
ture, of a cynical indifference to evil, —a tone of saying 
“Tt’s bad, but it’s common,”— is very destructive of 
high individual or social ideals. To help counteract 
. this, the experiment has been tried with reassuring 
success, in some schools, of having the pupils make a 
“record of virtue” by reporting daily or weekly all the 
good and true and noble things they could glean from 
their current reading. The plan is most cordiably rec- 
ommended to all schools. That image becomes most 
permanent which is most constantly kept before the 
mind. 
Parents and teachers should set before boys and girls 
.the best characters in literature, history, and biography ; 
not in any goody-goody way, not with too much stress 
upon the desirability of imitating them, but in a frank, 
cordial, rational way. Men and women cannot afford 
to do otherwise with themselves. What the imagina- 
tion habitually contemplates, that will it form into the 
ideals in whose image we make ourselves.

CHAPTER XVII. 
ASSIMILATION ; WILLING. 
Ir has been shown that the second operation of ‘the 
mind—assimilation— involves the processes of concep- 
tion (its first step, and one which connects it with ac- 
quisition), reasoning, and imagining. - Another process, 
which though not exclusively an assimilative one yet 
‘is essential in assimilation, is wz//ing. Every faculty 
is engaged in making the personality what it is, in 
building the intellectual and moral character structure. 
And will directs every faculty in its conscious func- 
tioning, determining in large measure what we shall 
perceive through the senses, what we shall think about, 
what we shall feel, and what we shall do. Vigor of 
willing not only makes character, it zs character, it is 
what we are intellectually and morally; and since 
assimilation is se/f-budlding, willing is therefore most 
intimately concerned in assimilation.

the question of the will’s “freedom,” yet a legitimate 
inference from the facts there set forth would the win 
be, that the will zs free in the best sense of Free. 
the word,—free from the absolute rule of motive. 
That this is true, and to what extent it is true, may be 
shown by some examples of willing and not-willing 
which are common in the experience of every one. 
On a hot day you suddenly remember that there are

lemons in the cupboard, and ice in the chest; and you 
want a glass of lemonade so much, that you can, as we 
say, almost “taste it.” But you are too indolent to 
get up from the hammock and go into the house to 
make the drink. Your desire is intense, but not enough 
so to cause your will to act; indeed, you may ineffec- 
tively say “I will go” several times, the will making 
feeble efforts to act in accordance with the desire. In 
such a case the motive is strong, there is no counter- 
motive, — for laziness can hardly be called a motive, — 
and yet the will does not respond to desire, is neither 
inhibited nor moved to effective action by any motive. 
Or the question to be decided may be one of the 
greatest importance in business affairs. Two or more

Ilustrations. you, each involving its own peculiar risks, 
and holding out its own promises of probable benefits. 
All the resources of experience are called upon, judg- 
ment and imagination are busily at work, and finally 
judgment pronounces its decision, “ This is the course 
to follow.” Then will acts, — determines to follow the 
course selected by judgment, and: begins to direct the 
mind’s energies to its accomplishment. 
Not infrequently the judgment is unable to reach a 
satisfactory’ decision; and the whole matter is laid 
aside, will taking no action further than to “throw the 
case out of court,” which it can do at any time. If a 
decision is reached and put into execution, will acts in 
accordance with the desire to better your trade, and in 
harmony with the decision of judgment as to the best 
way to do that. But the motive is no more the cause 
of the action of will than it is of the action of judg- 
ment; and it is to be observed that the motive—the  
-P-A-G-E-219
  
ASSIMILATION: WILLING. 219 
desire to improve your business —is as strong when 
judgment fails to reach a conclusion on which will can 
act as it is when the decision is reached and put into 
execution. 
There are people whom the popular phrase declares 
to be of “strong will.” Such people may be, and often 
are, marked by a limited range of judgment or other 
faculties. Having but few ideas, reaching but few con- 
clusions, they act upon these with forceful vigor. Will 
is free in the same sense in which the other faculties 
are, — free within the limits of knowledge and present 
environment. On the other hand, it is sometimes true 
that a man has too much knowledge of the facts in a 
given case, and his judgment is unable to reach a 
decision. Or knowledge may be inadequate to enable 
judgment to decide, and will takes a “leap in the dark,” 
choosing without special reference to any motive. 
The preceding illustrations may be taken as typifying 
the action or non-action of will in matters outside of 
ethics, matters that have no moral quality.’ win ana 
Into ethical questions, where the rightness Conscience. 
or wrongness of an action is to be considered, a new 
element enters, another motive, — conscience. This feel- 
ing of oughtness, of obligation to do right and avoid 
wrong, awakes as soon as any problem involving the 
morality of conduct is presented to judgment for solu- 
tion. Until judgment has decided what particular 
thing is right in any given case, the feeling is simply a 
general one, a sense of necessity to do right. When 
judgment has reached a conclusion, conscience becomes 
a powerful motive, which may be in ‘harmony with 
the other motives that make themselves felt at the 
time, or may be in opposition to them all. Will can

not only act in accord with other motives than con- 
science, or in accord with conscience, but it can also 
intensify it or the other motives, or dismiss, or at least 
weaken, all of them, conscience included, and bring up 
an entirely new set of feelings that may serve as reasons 
for action.

as the occasion of willing, then men’s actions could be

extent this can be done; and what we mean when we 
say we are “bringing pressure to bear” on some one, is 
that we are trying to influence his action through what 
we believe to be his strongest motives. But every one 
recognizes the element of uncertainty in even the best 
calculated scheme by which we hope to gain the desired 
action of another. So long as the element of uncer- 
tainty does not rise above an average determined by 
our experience with men in practical affairs, we call the 
will xormal,; but if the individual acts often from 
impulse or whim, or is obstinate and does not yield 
to ordinary or rational motives, then we call the will 
erratic. 
There are several phases of abnormal willing, from 
common impulsive action to conduct that results from 
Abnormal : deep-seated disease of the will. Willing that

what may properly be called “non-free” will; for in 
this, will acts solely in accord with the uppermost 
motive. 
Obstinacy seems to be abnormal willing, — willing

but apparently from a desire to will something, and will 
it vigorously, especially if it be different from what 
would naturally be expected in the case. 
By some persons, both children and adults, non- 
ethical and ethical acts are committed not only invol- 
untarily, but directly against the determination of will. 
Such acts, no doubt, characterized those “ possessed of 
devils,” and it would be hard'to find a better term’ 
than “ possessed” to name such people now. A some. 
thing within them, not themselves, seems to do the 
act. Examples of such apparently irresponsible action 
are sometimes observable in young people of marked 
nervous temperament. They call out profane or inde- 
cent words, or are guilty of reprehensible conduct 
toward their fellows; and even while in the act, they 
may suffer intensely from shame or the stings of con- 
science. Such cases should receive the tenderest and 
most sympathetic care of parent and teacher, and a 
close watch should be kept on all unusually nervous 
children, in order to detect the first signs of this pain- 
ful neuropathic condition. There are many other more 
marked aberrancies of will, but they come within the 
province of medical specialists. 
The several steps in the process of conscious normal 
willing may be summarized, then, as follows: (1) There 
is some occasion for choice, two or more pos- 
sible acts or courses of conduct being offered; 
(2) the motives begin to solicit decision and determina- 
tion in favor of this or that; (3) judgment more or less 
judicially considers the matter in the light of experi- 
ence and of the possible issues that imagination pictures, 
and decides which course is expedient; or, if the ques- 
tion be one of morals, which is right ; (4) will chooses that Summary.  
-P-A-G-E-222
  222 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
which judgment has recommended, determines to fol- 
low it now, or at some fitting future time, and, if now, 
‘proceeds to execute its determination by setting the 
proper muscles to work. But there are’ many depar- 
tures from the norm in the process of willing. When 
the judgment is undisciplined, it as often yields to 
motive as does a weak will. Persons whose feelings 
are stronger than their judgment are rightly called 
prejudiced; they prejudge a matter from their feeling 
concerning it, without waiting to weigh all the facts 
that should be considered. Sometimes, in persons 
of usually calm and unbiased judgment and normal 
will, some dominant idea seems to take possession of 
consciousness to the exclusion of all other ideas, 
and judgment and will both submit to its influence. 
Under such circumstances we say those persons are 
“carried away” by whatever temporarily dominates 
them. They themselves seem to have a subconscious- 
ness that they are not acting wisely. Any one is liable, 
under the stress of unusual desire or temptation, to 
do something in direct opposition to what is believed 
to be wise or right. 
APPLICATIONS TO TEACHING. 
The proper education of will is the making of char- 
acter, and necessarily involves the right direction of all 
the other activities, especially the motives, imagina- 
tion, and judgment. In cultivating the will, the law of 
use is as important as it is in the development of any 
other mental power. Every failure to determine, or to 
execute a determination after it is formed, makes the 
will weaker; every choice deliberately made, every
-P-A-G-E-223
ASSIMILATION: WILLING. 223 
determination resolutely executed, makes the volitional 
power more vigorous. 
The teacher must set before himself, as the end to be 
reached in his efforts at character building, the pupil’s 
self-control in right directions ; and all his means must 
involve the use of the pupzl’s will. No so-called “ dis- 
cipline” is worth anything, or can be other than injuri- 
ous, which tries to secure good behavior solely through 
external coercion, or by bribing through a system of 
prizes and rewards. It is not to be understood that 
coercion and inducement should not be used at all ; but 
they must not be used except to secure general good 
conduct until some way can be found by which the 
pupil can be got to behave of himself. 
The purpose of the American public school is to 
make citizens capable of living under a form of se/f- 
government. Self-government in state or ge. 
nation can mean nothing more than the self-control. 
government of the individual. Law is for those who 
are not self-governing, and does not touch those who 
have the power of self-control. It is almost beyond 
dispute that there would be no use for reformatories, 
jails, state prisons, or criminal courts, if every zndz- 
vidual in the community could govern himself. Self- 
control is used here in its widest application, to mean 
not only control of impulses, of wrong tendencies, of 
evil desire, and passion, but also to mean control of 
wasteful activity or negligent sloth of any kind. It 
includes self-direction. 
To act upon impulse is almost always to act un- 
wisely ; and since impulsiveness is character- Taiputaive

pupils to exercise will as an zzhzbitive force in the con- 
trol of tendencies to too ready action. They must be 
made to know that every imprint upon the soul is, ina 
real sense, ineffaceable. Every indulgence, every selfish 
act, every “sowing of wild oats,” leaves a mark that 
cannot be outgrown or outlived, no matter how sincere 
the repentance may be. The nervous, emotional tem- 
perament, in adults as well as in children, is prone to 
waste energy, to spend more muscular force or brain 
force than is necessary to the proper accomplishment 
of a given task. Much energy is dissipated in worry, a 
most exhausting form of waste. 
Many persons, old and young, waste force through 
the emotions and affections. They indulge in strong

are nearly as evil in the one case as in the other. All 
forms of worry and undue! emotional excitement should 
be inhibited through will. The volitional faculty should 
be used to secure and maintain a calm, evenly bal- 
anced life. Dr. Abbott puts it thus: “ No problem is 
so exacting as that which is presented to a man by him- 
self; none other demands for its solution such infinite 
patience and persistence. As there is no struggle so 
severe and exacting as that which a man has to make 
with himself, so there is no victory so noble as that 
which a man wins over himself.”

woman —is to choose, determine, and act in accord

Motive.” The highest motive that can influence ethical 
conduct is the desire to do right because it is right. 
But this motive is too high for most adults, and of
-P-A-G-E-225
ASSIMILATION: WILLING. 225 
course would not serve as the basis of a very effective 
appeal to children. The lowest motive that can be used 
to influence conduct is fear in any form; but, because 
it seems temporarily effective, it is very often used. 
The expectation of “prizes” or “rewards of merit” is 
nearly as bad. The essential evil in the use of fear or 
any other motive that responds only to some external 
coercion or inducement is, that, as soon as the external 
influence is removed, right conduct becomes irregular, 
or ceases. The only effective and abiding cause of con- 
duct is wzthin the individual. It may be that fear or 
cupidity must be appealed to at times, sufficiently at 
least to set the child in the right path, but the higher 
motives should be used to keep him there. 
The best general direction for will training may be 
stated thus: Use the highest motives to which the indi- 
vidual (or the school as a whole) can be got pjirection 
to respond; then use the advantage thus for will 
gained to create high ideals, which shall be- et : 
come standards of conduct. The proper cultivation of 
the motives (feelings) is of the highest importance in 
building moral character. It is by no means enough 
that we shall be taught ¢o know right from wrong: such 
knowledge does not of itself prompt to right doing. 
We must also intensely /ee/ about it,—feel the im- 
perative of conscience especially. 
Character is not fully established until right conduct 
has become habitual: will finds it easy to work along 
lines of least resistance. The teacher, then, must use 
every effort to convert right action into habit, in his 
pupils. : 
The general direction just given for character build. 
ing through education of will, involves the education

of every other faculty; and every other faculty is, of 
course, concerned in the making of character, but the 
will is the director and executor. A man may be con- 
scious of sound memory, discerning judgment, vivid 
imagination, and wholesome normal feeling, and at the 
same time be keenly conscious of an utter inadequacy 
due to deficient will power. This is simply another 
way of saying that boys and girls must be influenced 
to use the will for the attainment of high ideals, if 
they are to grow to self-reliant, integral manhood and 
womanhood. 
Some form of affection or desire is usually the highest 
motive which can influence the conduct of children and 
young people. An enumeration and discussion of such 
feelings as are thought to be most effective have been 
given in Chapters X.and XI. But judgment, which in 
this connection may well be called the “ rational motive,”

Motive. to form standards and ideals of conduct. 
Even young boys and girls will, of their own choice, 
do many things from a rational motive, because it is 
wise or right to do them, rather than from a mere 
desire for pleasure. 
In the training of the young, permanency of environ- 
ment, if the environment is at all good, is of the utmost 
Environ-~ importance. Too frequent change of resi- 
ment. dence, too ‘much travel, too much sight- 
seeing, tend to weaken the influences that give stability 
and wholeness to character. And indeed it takes a 
strong, well-matured character to withstand frequent 
change of surroundings, frequent contact with different 
standards of conduct and different motives of action. 
In this fact is to be found part, at least, of the expla-

nation why a shifting population is apt to be more or 
less criminal. 
It is worthy of frequent repetition that the best 
means at the teacher’s disposal for forming the stand- 
ards and ideals of his pupils are to be other 
found in history, biography, and literature. Aids. 
Through these, feeling, judgment, imagination, may all 
be reached and educated. The youth, by being brought 
to feel the same motives, build the same standards of 
conduct, and picture the same successes, as those of 
which he reads in biography or literature, will be caused 
to mold his own life after the ideals thus created within 
him. 
The young are so imitative, usually unconsciously 
so, that the teacher should in himself exhibit high 
standards of right, lofty ideals, and firm se//- the Teacher

frivolous, trivial-minded, and with- varying standards of 
action, soon inoculates a whole school with these char- 
acteristics; while, on the other hand, the firm, even- 
tempered, self-controlled, judicial teacher communicates 
his own qualities to his pupils. 
The process of willing is intimately bound up with 
any philosophy of living. The best principle of life 
that the teacher can follow or weave into the a phitosophy 
habits of his pupils is, “Prove all things, of Living. 
_ hold fast that which is good,” and bend an undeviating 
will to the doing of the best that you can do; and with 
that be content, not worrying or fretting. Thoreau 
says, “To dwell long upon one’s errors and misde- 
meanors is to add to the offense. Not to grieve long 
for any action, but to go immediately and do freshly 
and otherwise, subtracts so much from the’ wrong.”

This is in no way in conflict with the “divine discon- 
tent” which is and has been the mainspring of all that 
is best in human endeavor, of all most effective human 
willing. Pope was as psychologic as he was poetic 
when he wrote, — 
“< Hope springs eternal in the human breast : 
Man never 2s, but always 0 de blest.”

REPRODUCTION. 229 
CHAPTER XVIII. 
REPRODUCTION. 
REPRODUCTION is the operation which involves the 
creation of thought and the expression of thought and 
feeling in language and action. The terms 
language and action should be extended to 
include the various forms of av¢. Painting, sculpture, 
and music are means of expression of the highest order. 
The painter, the sculptor, the musician, utter their 
ideas and ideals as truly as do the essayist, the orator, 
the poet. 
The comparison of mind activity with the bodily 
organism and functions may be briefly used again to 
illustrate this definition. To preserve the yi04anq 
physical economy, food must be acquired Body com- 
and assimilated, — must be taken into the "+ 
body after proper preparation, and there undergo such 
changes as will make it into new tissue. But all this is 
useless, unless there be some outward result of the 
inward assimilation, shown not only in increased vigor 
and capacity for work, but in the actual work done_ 
through this increased capacity. So the mind, in order 
to grow, must acquire knowledge and assimilate it, | 
making it over into new thought, and building it into | ° 
the personality and character of the individual. But 
this is profitless, unless there be outward expression of | 
the inward activity in language and conduct. The Definition.
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
results of mental assimilation must be made outwardly 
manifest. 
Creation has already been considered as the work of 
imagination, aided by judgment and other faculties. 
It is the connecting process between assimi- 
lation and reproduction. Its results are new 
concepts and ideals, new combinations of thought, 
new images, new standards, new purposes. 
That these may be wrought out to fulfill the law of 
individual activity, and to have their effect in making 
or marring human happiness, there must be_ 
expression. We cannot know what a man’s 
thoughts are, or his ideals or his.character, except as 
these are made known to us through his words and 
acts. His true thought, his real character, may not be 
expressed always, but something that has been Gaemghs 
and felt within him shows forth in expression. 
As there are three kinds of education, — physical, 
intellectual, moral,—with the corresponding forms of 
Three Forms “aracter, so there are three forms of expres- 
of Expres- sion, — physical expression, in which phy- 
sion. sical character is made manifest ; intellectual 
expression, in which intellectual character is made 
manifest ; and moral expression, or moral conduct, the 
outward evidence of moral character. It takes very 
little observation to discover that these three forms of 
expression are real and distinct. 
Physical character is shown in the dress, in the car- 
riage of the body, in ways of standing and sitting and 
walking, and in all things requiring physical activity 
for their accomplishment. ‘ Inefficient or defective phys- 
ical character is expressed in stooping posture, slouch- 
ing, uncertain gait, and poorly coérdinated movements Creation. 
Expression.
-P-A-G-E-231
  
REPRODUCTION. 231 
of body and hands in any work demanding careful 
muscular adjustment. Defective mental character is 
also frequently indicated in some one or more of these 
ways, and in tone, gesture, and facial expression. 
But it is rather in language and conduct that intel- 
lectual and moral character have their expression. The 
power to think vigorously and effectively is shown in 
the use of vigorous and effective language. Moral in- 
tegrity is shown in honesty, truthfulness, purity, charity. 
The outward expression also reacts upon the character 
to strengthen and fix it. Modes of expression become 
habitual, and it is easier for thought and feeling to find 
outlet through tracks already formed than to force new 
ones: hence the danger of letting any but the best forms 
of expression become habits. Expression should never 
be permitted to become wholly unconscious or involun- 
tary; there is always the possible need of a changed 
form of expression to suit the growing character. 
A specially valuable fact is to be noted in this con- 
nection; and that is, that, if one persists in forms of 
expression foreign to his natural character, peaction 
the reaction will be felt in the awakening of 
of thoughts and feelings corresponding to **?"ss°"- 
the expression. A timid man, if he will persistently 
wear the garb and adopt the carriage of a frontier 
desperado, will inevitably /ee/ something of the swag- 
gering bravado of his model. The habitual liar, if 
he will follow truth-telling rigorously for a time, will 
come to think less of lying. It is on the reaction 
of expression upon character that keepers of reforma- 
tories and prisons largely rely to work improvement 
in the character of their charges. If men are com- 
pelled to keep clean, to walk upright, to forego intoxi-

  232 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
cants, to eat plain food, and to do honest work, the 
character of all but the most abandoned will respond 
to the changed forms of outward behavior. 
All three forms of expression, as named above, de- 
mand psychic activity in greater or less degree. Even 
though some modes of expression have become habitual, 
they were once voluntary, and required conscious ef- 
‘fort. The putting of thought and feeling into language | 
and action involves judging, imagining, and willing. A 
No statistics have been taken on the subject, but 
there is good ground for believing that the majority 
of persons do much of their thinking in concepts rather 
than in words: most of their images and ideas are pre- 
sented to consciousness unclothed in language. A dis- 
tinct and more or less strenuous effort is necessary in 
finding language or other symbols for the exact expres- 
sion of what is in the mind. There must be strenuous

CULTIVATION OF EXPRESSION. 
Although it is with intellectual and moral expression 
that the teacher, under present educational conditions, 
has most to do, yet he must concern himself, as much 
as opportunity and equipment allow, with the expres- 
sion of physical character. He should be alert to dis- 
cover, and to do what he can to correct, physical faults. 
He should be watchful of playground sports and games, 
since these betray both physical and mental tendencies. .
-P-A-G-E-233
REPRODUCTION. 233 
He should sympathetically and intelligently direct some 
of the physical activity of both boys and girls, so that 
it may become a truer expression of right natural 
tendencies, and may react against evil character ele- 
ments. When it can be afforded, there should be 
some provision of gymnastic apparatus, even play and 
if only of the simplest kind. This should Gymnastics. 
be used to cultivate the physical character of every 
pupil. This idea is, of course, carried out now in kin- 
dergartens, colleges, and universities ; but it has wrought 
but little change in primary and lower secondary schools, 
and is almost unknown incountry schools. This matter 
will be presented more in detail in the next chapter. 
The putting forth of thought and feeling is mainly 
by means of language, spoken and written; and the 
teacher must therefore address himself to the work of 
training his pupils to use language correctly, fluently, 
and naturally. 
In the recitation the teacher has an opportunity, not 
afforded him at any other time, for testing his pupils 
as to the three kinds of character, and for The 
cultivating their proper expression. In re- Recitation. 
citing, the pupil gives, for the most part unconsciously, 
evidence of defective physical and mental equipment, 
or of physical and mental integrity. A weak, drooping 
carriage of the body in sitting or standing is one of the 
commonest indications, at the recitation seat, of lack 
of physical tone. Pupils should be made to sit and 
stand with erect head and shoulders, and with back held 
straight. So commonplace a statement would not need 
to be made were it not so often disregarded. The reci- 
tation also affords opportunity to discover defects of 
sight and hearing.  
-P-A-G-E-234
  234 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
Quality of moral character will be shown in recitation 
by the pupil’s accepting or rejecting “promptings” 
from his classmates; by his trying to conceal his igno- 
rance from his teacher, or by his candid and full state- 
ment of his difficulties in comprehending the lesson; 
Cheating and in numerous other ways so well known 
inClass. to teachers of all grades. But it is not, of 
course, safe to take cheating or deceit in class as always 
indicative of the general moral condition of the pupil. 
Among students, almost from the primary grade up, 
there is a sort of tradition that it is not only not wrong, 
but rather the correct thing, to take what advantage 
they can of the teacher, and cheat him into a good 
opinion of their ability; and pupils will do this who 
would scorn to lie or cheat on the playground or in 
their social relations. 4 
At the same time, a tendency to cheat and deceive 
in the recitation indicates lack of correct standards of 
right, and the teacher should do all possible to bring 
his pupils to see the matter in its true light. Other- 
wise the pupil who lives by a double standard in school 
may easily grow into a man or woman living by a 
double standard in the world. 4 
The best test the recitation affords is of the zn- 
tellectual character. From the pupil’s expression of 
thought in language, the teacher can judge of his power 
to observe, to reflect, to imagine, to will. It must not 
be forgotten that expressing thought is hard work, 
quite as hard work, often, as making thought. There- 
fore pupils are prone to clothe their ideas in rags and

with much poor pronunciation and far poorer enuncia-

  REPRODUCTION. 235 
tion. In correcting and reforming the spoken language 
of the pupils, the teacher will have to labor against the 
powerful examples and associations of home surround- 
ings, as well as against the habit and carelessness of the 
pupils themselves. In his efforts to correct their syntax 
and phraseology, he will even run counter to sentiment 
as well as to habits and associations; for among the 
masses of the people there is a feeling that correct 
expression is an affectation and a sign of foppishness. 
Strange as it may seem, many persons, both young and 
old, do not use as good language as they know, from 
fear of ridicule; but the most patient and persistent 
effort should be put upon the task of having each pupil 
express his thought, in recitation, in clear, concise, 
complete sentences properly pronounced and clearly 
enunciated. 
It is unfortunately true that a majority of teachers 
seem satisfied if they can but get the pupils to give 
pretty good evidence of a knowledge of the lesson, and 
do not seem to care in what sort of /anguage this 
knowledge is expressed. Other teachers seem to think 
they avoid the difficulty of slouchy language if they 
insist that the pupils shall recite in the exact language 
of the text-book. While this may in some cases be 
effective in securing proper expression, it is usually one 
of the surest ways to dull*the originality of the pupil, 
and diminish the activity of every faculty but memory. 
To cultivate the power to express, it is not sufficient 
that the pupil shall be required merely to. Pupils must reproduce, by an act of memory, both the © fecite in 
thought and the language of another; but ae 
he must make the thought his own by under- 
standing it, and then forge it into words of his own 
 
-P-A-G-E-236

selection. It is the pupzl’s ability to express, that the 
teacher is concerned with, not that of the text-book 
writers. Therefore insist that the pupil shall recéte 
in his own language, that his sentences shall be correctly 
framed, and that his words shall be properly pronounced 
and distinctly enounced. 
What has been said so far, of expression training in’ 
the recitation, applies more particularly to oral recita- 
written tions; but tablet and pencil should be a part 
Expression. of the equipment of every pupil as soon as he 
is old enough to use them, and should be used in nearly 
every recitation. It is by writing that accuracy of ex- 
pression is best secured. There is no subject a part or 
all of the recitation in which may not be often written 
advantageously. There may be written recitations in 
spelling, reading, history, arithmetic, etc., in which the 
aims shall be the same as in oral recitations, except that 
‘accuracy of spelling, punctuation, paragraphing, etc., 
takes the place of accuracy in pronunciation and enun- 
ciation. Much written work in every branch, on tablet 
and blackboard, should be insisted on in all primary and 
secondary schools; and written work in various forms 
should be given a prominent place in the daily exer- 
cises of the college and the university, and all of it 
should receive from the teacher as critical an examina- 
tion and correction of the /anguage used as of the 
statements regarding the subject-matter. A student 
of biology, for instance, should have both the biology 
and the English of his paper criticised; and if his punc- 
tuation, paragraphing, spelling, syntax, and _phrase- 
ology are not good, he should not be marked high, no 
matter how correct his biology may be. 
It was shown in’ previous chapters that there are

cultivation of the observational powers; others, to the

as the individuality of the man or woman is in a book

in all schools, up to the college; and drawing should 
have a place in all curricula of formal education, no 
matter how extended these may be. Some skill in 
these forms of expression it is as much the business 
of the schools to give as it is to train in language or 
mathematics: an education is not an all-round educa- 
tion without them. 
In the work of the primary school, the increased 
power of the pupil should be brought into expression 
by more oral work than can be used in the kindergarten. 
There should be a definite period devoted each day to 
conversations between the teacher and the conversa- 
primary pupils, in which the talk should be _ ti"s- 
free and spontaneous, on some subject of interest to 
the little people. The teacher’s aim must be to secure 
(t) ready expression, (2) correct expression. Wrong 
pronunciation, slipshod enunciation, and bad syntax, 
should be quietly and sympathetically corrected. No

exercise of the school is more important than this con- 
versation exercise; nor does any require more careful 
and ingenious preparation, or more skill in conducting 
it. If the teacher is not genuinely interested, and sin- 
cere, or is unable to quicken the interest of the pupils, 
the exercise will degenerate into a mechanical word- 
grind, in which there can be no real expression of the 
child. 
As soon as the pupils are able to write with some | 
readiness, simple composition exercises should be intro- 
Composi- duced. The first aim in such exercises should 
tion. _be to secure, as nearly as possible, automatic 
exactness in what may be called “mechanics ”’ of writ- 
ten composition. By the time the pupil has finished 
the fourth-reader grade, correct punctuation, capitali- 
zation, and paragraphing should be done by him as 
automatically, almost, as the letters are made. Of 
course, while this precision is being acquired, and in 
order to secure it, the work of composition on paper 
must be made as znteresting as possible, and the mental 
quality of the writing must be kept fully up to the 
pupil’s rising level of power. The saying of Bacon is 
true, that “writing maketh an exact man,” for there 
is no other exercise whereby exactness in expression 
can be so thoroughly attained as putting thought into 
writing ; and it is lamentable that no other exercise 
is more neglected in formal teaching, in all grades of 
schools. There is not a week of school life, from the 
time the pupil can write at all to the time when he 
goes out with his university degree, in which he ought 
not, under a teacher’s direction, to express on paper 
some of his best thought in the best language he 
can use; and this should be done not merely in his
-P-A-G-E-239
  REPRODUCTION. 239 
English course, but in every study. The cultivation of 
expression should no more be confined to a few lessons 
in composition, or left wholly to a professor or group of 
professors of language and literature, than the training 
of a pupil in courtesy, truthfulness, and honesty, should 
be confined to one set of exercises or be left to a “ pro- 
fessor” of these’ virtues. very class should be an 
expression class, every study should involve exercises 
in the putting of thought into written language. This 
idea is emphasized in the following quotation from the 
Report of the Committee of Ten: “It is a funda- 
mental idea in this report, that the study of every other 
subject should contribute to the pupil’s training in 
English; and that the pupil’s capacity to write English 
should be made available, and be developed, in every 
other department.” 
In addition to the general exercises here indicated, 
there ought to be, of course, regular class work in 
English composition, both theoretical and practical, 
in all primary and secondary schools, and through the 
collegiate sophomore year, if not longer. 
Reading as an exercise in itself, and the study of 
literature, both indirectly and directly aid in the cul- 
tivation of expression. Through oral read-  pegaing 
ing as a school exercise, correct pronun- and Liter- 
ciation, enunciation, and inflection should *"* 
be acquired; and in both reading and literature the 
study of words should have a prominent place. All 
words new to the pupil should be noted, defined, and, 
when possible, used. The study of words, their origi- 
nal meaning, their present force, and their synonyms, 
can profitably be made a special school exercjse, from 
the fourth grade up. The dictionary is, of course,
-P-A-G-E-240
  240 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
indispensable in such exercises ; and every pupil should, 
at the proper degree of advancement, be taught to use 
it effectively. 
It is unfortunate that not more teachers are able to 
cultivate the voices of their pupils by proper exercise 
in oral reading; for the voice is, in tone and inflection, 
one of the chiefest means of expression, — as important, 
indeed, as language itself. But a cultivated voice is 
even more seldom heard than good oral reading or 
correct and fluent speech. 
The study of literature furnishes models, the influ. 
ence of which is effective in the cultivation of both oral 
and written expression. forms of expression, and the 
combinations of words and phrases, should receive care- 
ful attention, for they constitute s¢y/e,— that indefinable 
something which is the aroma of expression. The 
principal defect in the so-called study of literature in 
most schools is that it is a study about literature rather 
than a study of literature itself. 
Declaiming is simply reading without the book, and 
with a touch more of dramatic effect than oral reading 
eat demands. It is an excellent exercise if care 
be taken to save the student from falling 
into stilted and unnatural tones and gestures: natural. 
ness, even though it be crude, is far preferable to any 
kind of artificial speaking. 
There can be no better exercise than debating for the 
cultivation of fluent and correct oral expression. It 
can be profitably introduced into the fourth- 
reader. grade of the country school, and 
should form a part of the required curriculum of every 
school, all the way up to and through the university. 
There is no more reason why training in forensics Debating.  
-P-A-G-E-241
  REPRODUCTION. 241 
should be left to the students’ “literary societies” 
than that the study of arithmetic should be left to a 
students’ “arithmetical society.” 
Argumentative discourse is the best by which to cul- 
tivate readiness of expression, because it excites the 
interest of the participants as no other form of discourse 
can, and thus secures that sincerity and naturalness of 
expression without which no utterance is effective, and 
because it necessitates much dmpromptu speaking. Turn- 
ing a subject over and over in the mind, studying its 
significance, and searching for language adequate to 
set forth this significance ; the demand for readiness in 
rejoinder, for ability quickly to select the strongest 
words in which to frame replies to the arguments of an 
opponent, —all cultivate quickness and exactness of 
expression. These forensic drills should be under the 
sympathetic and skillful direction of a properly equipped 
teacher. It is certainly an excellent indication of the 
good judgment of many college faculties, that they are 
encouraging debating contests between students of dif- 
ferent institutions, and are thus. doing something to 
call attention to the fact that training in intellectual 
expression is at- least equal in importance to leg-train- 
ing in football bouts. 
Secondary schools, and institutions of higher learning, 
are beginning to wake up to the fact that “ expression 
crowns their work,” and are casting about for satisfac- 
tory methods of making up for what has been and 
is a shameful lack. These words of Professor Hart go 
straight to the mark: “Failure in English pyaining in 
should disqualify any one from graduation English. 
from any institution. We have no right to certify to 
the world as an educated person one who is unable 
Roark Psych.— 16,
-P-A-G-E-242
  242 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
to express himself clearly and correctly in his mother 
tongue.” And Dr. Brooks was wholly right when he 
said, “Better neither Latin, Greek, nor science than 
ignorance of the mother tongue.” : 
No subject has received more discussion in the past 
few years than the question of how most effectively to 
teach English in American schools and colleges. Our 
institutions have worshiped the fetich of foreign lan- 
guages, both dead and living, so blindly and so long, 
that to write and speak passable English is a rather 
rare accomplishment. The Committee of Ten deemed 
the matter of English expression of sufficient impor- 
tance to demand the most thoughtful consideration of 
it; and the recommendations of this committee, in Bul- 
letin No. 205 of the U.S. Bureau of Education, should 
be studied by every teacher. 
The operation of expression involves the highest 
activity of the mind, and requires the use of every 
faculty... The senses and memory put knowl- 
edge-material before judgment and imagina- 
tion. These elaborate the material into new thought, 
and then clothe the thought with words, or put it into 
art forms. Expression, of course, requires that there 
shall be something to express: so acquisition and 
assimilation must precede expression. The mind must 
be stored with percepts and concepts; it must use judg- 
ment and imagination actively in combining these into 
new forms and ideals; it must be attuned to feel beauty 
and righteousness. Then it'may seek the power with 
which to utter forth its thought and feeling in winged 
words, in marble or bronze, on the quickening canvas, 
or in the imperishable harmonies of sound. 
Expression ts the teacher's test of his own failure or Summary.

success. Do his pupils show increased physical health, 
greater power to think, and to say and write what 
they think, and a sturdier moral nature, than when 
they came to him? If so, his teaching has been effec- 
tive; if not, he has failed. 
The power to express is also the test of success in 
the practical affairs of life. He who can most quickly 
marshal his thoughts, and send them forth in words 
filled with meaning, and electric with the force of mind, 
is master, and sways the multitude as he wills, whether 
he writes in the closet, or speaks in the forum. And 
he who speaks to mankind through ar?, expressing for 
them their purest ideals and aspirations, has always 
been called divine.

CHAPTER XIX. 
APPLICATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY TO FORMAL 
EDUCATION. 
THE attempt has been made in the preceding chap- 
ters to show why the teacher needs psychology, and 
how he can make it of service in his daily teaching. 
In this chapter it is designed to revert again to the 
definitions previously given of education and teaching, 
and to show the necessary and vital connection which 
a knowledge of mind has with the whole science and 
art of education. A system of formal education will 
be set forth which will serve as one of many attempts 
now being made to use what is known of mind and 
mind growth as the basis of human development by 
the consciously directed agencies of the school, the 
college, and the university. 
There are many questions connected with the organi- 
zation of the means of formal education, the answers 
to which must be sought more or less directly in psychol- 
ogy. All of these fall within the wide domain of 
sociology, for sociology includes all questions the right 
solutions of which make it easier for man to live a 
human life. And sociology must come to psychology 
with all other questions, as well as with those concerning 
the best ways and means of education. A 
Education, as to its specific sociological purposes, 
may be divided into formative and reformative. Forma-
-P-A-G-E-245
APPLICATIONS TO FORMAL EDUCATION. 245 
tive education is that of which the purpose is to 
develop and train the young and unformed i ; : ‘he Formative body and mind to right functioning. The ana Reform- 
object is the formation of character. severe ae . : : ° cation, 
Reformative education is that of which the 
purpose is to take those who, by reason of heredity and 
environment, are deformed in character, and try, by 
specially devised methods, to win them back to right 
living, right thinking, right willing. The object is the 
reformation of character. 
Many different agencies have been organized for this 
work by those who feel that to provide for this sort 
of education is as much the duty of society peformative 
as to provide for the formative. G Among’ Ae*acs: 
these agencies are reform schools, reform farms, college 
settlements in the slums, houses of refuge, and special 
systems of management for prisons and for asylums for 
the insane. The central idea in each of these is the 
necessity of getting the child, the man, the woman, to 
understand that liberty in a human community can be 
enjoyed only on the conditions of honest self-support, 
and intellectual and moral self-control: hence all means 
are used to quicken the motives, to strengthen the will, 
and to give the individual the power and the skill to 
make a livelihood. Of course, if intellectual,or moral 
obliquity rests upon physical disease, this must first be 
cured or ameliorated.) Further discussion of reforma- 
tive education lies outside the province of this book. 
; SOME PROBLEMS STATED. 
The chief problems of formative education may be 
generically grouped under these three heads: (1) the 
organization of educational forces and appliances ; (2) 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  246 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
the organization of the zxzdividual school; (3) the ad- 
ministration of the school to secure the aims of its 
organization. 
In the first are involved such matters as the right re- 
lation of the community (state or nation) to education ; 
the mutual relations of the primary and secondary 
schools and the institutions ranking above them ; the 
place of professional schools in a state system ; the re- 
lations of the state to private educational institutions ; 
the teaching of morals and religion in public schools. 
In the second are involved the kinds of studies, their 
relative values, their proper order in the several courses, 
and the correlation of these courses. 
In the third belong school management and method- 
ology. 
The results of the inquiry as to what part psychology 
‘plays in the solution of the more important of the ques- 
tions above given are put forth tentatively and with no 
feeling of finality or dogmatism, but with an earnest 
desire to aid in the establishment of something definite 
in educational philosophy. 
Has the community, whether organized as city, state, 
or nation, a right to establish and maintain a system of 
schools by public taxation? In reply to this, The Right : of the Com. Much may be said pro and con; but almost 
munity to all civilized countries, and some half-barba- Educate. * . 
rous ones, have already given the question a 
practical affirmative answer. Never in the history of 
the world was the idea of universal public education so 
prevalent as it is now. 
A part, at least, of the explanation of this, may be 
found in the fact that an organized human community 
has, in a true sense, a psychic existence which is a com-
-P-A-G-E-247
  
APPLICATIONS TO FORMAL EDUCATION. 247 
posite of the psychic lives of the individuals. When 
we speak of the “German type” or the “ American 
type,” we mean not only the physical characteristics 
(form, feature, stature, etc:), but we mean also the mental 
peculiarities— the ways of thinking, the ethical stand- 
ards, the expression of the inner life in literature and 
art —that mark one nation as differing from another. 
There is a psychology of the nation as well as of the 
individual, —a truth which some seem prone to forget, 
who would have us in America adopt German, or 
French, or English systems and methods of education. 
But there is, in a still closer sense, a psychology of 
society as an organism. Society is a growth with its 
own vital and psychic laws. This fact which society an 
has received especial recognition from Spen- Organism. 
cer, must be taken into account in tracing social changes 
and progress. 
As the individual man has added to his safety and 
prolongation of life by increasing his intelligence, so 
the social organism gains safety and permanency from 
an increase of the general social intelligence. 
It took the shedding of much blood to teach this > 
truth fully to two of the most enlightened nations of 
Europe. Now, both France and Germany show by their 
thoroughgoing provisions for popular education, that 
they believe a soldier can fight better with brains and 
bullets than with bullets alone, and that obedience to 
law is more readily yielded from within the individual 
than it can be coerced from without. 
In a republic the necessity of universal education is 
greater than in a monarchy, because in a republic power 
lies in the hands of all citizens, and power without 
knowledge is eminently dangerous.
-P-A-G-E-248
  248 : PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
To the question, then, whether the community has 
aright to establish and maintain agencies for general 
education at public expense, the answer must be a 
strong affirmative; because in the state, as in the indi- 
vidual, education means increased intelligence, higher 
’ standards, purer patriotism, and a quickened conscience. 
The state educates its citizens in order to secure its 
own safety and permanency. Self-preservation is a 
first law of states as of individuals. 
The external organization of a state system of educa- 
tion is work for the legislator: the zxternal organiza- 
Digaaisation tion is the work of the educator, and should 
of Educa- be based on a sound psychology. Since the 
ou "internal organization of a system is insepa- 
rably connected with the organization of the individual 
school, both will be discussed together. 
The definition of education offered in the Introduc- 
tion calls for the “preparation of the individual in 
physical, intellectual, and moral capacities,” and such 
education the state must provide. (The primary object 
of state education is sound citizenship, and this can be 
secured only by educating for sound manhood and 
womanhood,” This definition of education is in accord 
with the modern dogma that “the whole child must go 
to school.” But,although this saying has become worn 
from much use, it can hardly be doubted that it is fully 
carried out in only a very few schools of any grade. 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION. 
( Healthy, continued activity of mind depends upon 
sound physical development and growth.) There is a 
direct ratio between mental wholeness, and good lungs, 
nutrition, and muscular exercise. (Proper provision
-P-A-G-E-249
  
  APPLICATIONS TO FORMAL EDUCATION. 249 
should therefore be made in the individual school, and 
in every system of schools, for physical education. ) 
It is rare to find, even in the wealthiest public or 
endowed colleges and universities, adequate provision 
for physical training: in the primary schools there is 
almost none, beyond a few simple marching and cal- 
isthenic exercises. In the country schools this lack is, 
fortunately, largely made good by the outdoor life of 
the pupils, both at home and at school, which affords 
opportunities for outlet in right directions, of the natural 
activity of the boys and girls. 
But even in the country school there is need that 
the teacher should use ectiolariied methods of giving 
his pupils some definite physical training) tn the

over-exertion and the too constant exercise of any 
particular set of muscles. Every country teacher will 
readily realize the necessity of such control over the 
tendency of his pupils to take up some game and 
play it day after day until both pupils and game are 
worn out. 
At the beginning of school the teacher should care- 
fully note such pupils as betray any physical weakness, 
and in every way possible secure their zxterested partici- 
pation in those sports and games that will bring into 
activity the defective muscles and organs. Children’s 
plays may easily be classed according to the particular 
sense organs or set of muscles they are best suited to 
cultivate; and, in addition to the usual games, special 
exercises may be devised by the observant and sympa- 
thetic teacher, to supplement the spontaneous play. 
He should be on the playground at every general inter- 
mission, to direct, control, and inspire physical activity,
-P-A-G-E-250
ee ce ee 
250 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
as he directs, controls, and inspires mental activity in 
the schoolroom. 
In towns and cities the problem of proper physical 
training is not so easily solved as in the country, and 
will not be until boards of education come 
to see the vicious stinginess of cramped 
schoolhouses and schoolyards. (Good ventilation and 
lighting, hygienic seating, and sufficient room for out- 
door exercise, should be secured, at whatever cost of 
mere dollars} and to these should be added a more or 
less complete equipment for gymnastic training. ) In 
the larger cities the gymnasia should be under the 
direction of a specialist and a corps of trained assist- 
ants. A little less money for dead languages, and a 
little more for living lungs and muscles, would be a 
good thing in many city school systems. 
The college and university should provide fully 
equipped gymnasia, and make physical training a re- 
Tn Catiewe quirement for all students. As each student 
and Uni- matriculates, he (and she) should be meas- 
versity. ured, weighed, and otherwise tested physic- 
ally, as he is tested mentally in entrance examinations. 
Upon the results of this physical examination should 
be prescribed a gymnasium course. 
The contrast between an intelligently directed gym- 
nastic course and the usual athletic training a young 
man gets at college, lies in the fact that in athletics 
those who do not need the training get it, while in the 
gymnastic course each student gets exactly the kind 
and amount of exercise he needs for his all-round 
physical development. If the modern idea of educa- 
tion is to be wrought out, a college student should no 
more be permitted an “ election” in athletics or other In the City. 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
APPLICATIONS TO FORMAL EDUCATION. 251 
forms of physical training than he is in his intellectual 
studies. 
The methods of physical training briefly set forth 
above are for the general development of the whole 
body; but there is another kind of training, Manuat 
partly physical, partly mental, which cannot Training. 
be neglected if the “whole child” is to be educated. 
Manual training — or, as it is termed by some, manu- 
mental training —is now almost universally recognized 
as an indispensable factor in a complete education. 
There are two reasons, either one of which is suffi- 
cient, why it should have a place in public schools: 
(1) because it is the business of public education to 
prepare the pupil to live as a self-supporting citizen in 
a community of his fellows; (2) because through hand 
training the mind can be developed more readily and 
effectively than without it. 
To be self-supporting, a citizen must have the ability 
to make an honest living. The majority of citizens in 
any community make a living by use of hands and 
brains, rather than by use of brains alone; that is to 
say, most people earn a support by manual labor rather 
than in purely intellectual pursuits. It is, then, at least 
as much the duty of the state to provide hand training 
as it isto provide mind training. Manual training seems 
to be one of the surest means of making education 
truly democratic rather than aristocratic: it provides 
for the needs of the many, hot merely for the culture 
of the few, and it dignifies manual labor. The indict- 
ment often brought against the schools of every country 
is, that they increase the army of the discontented by 
cultivating the intellect and the capacity to feel, with- 
out proportionately training either mind or hands to 
skill in providing for increased wants.
-P-A-G-E-252
  252 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
The excellent results attending the introduction of 
manual training in some form into many’ kinds of 
schools seem to close the argument regarding its effec- 
tiveness as a means of quickening intellectual activity. 
According to reports from different schools, the purely 
intellectual work of those pupils who receive manual 
training is done in much less time, with greater zeal 
and more thoroughness, than it was before manual 
training was introduced. These results are in accord 
with the teaching of psychology, that the mind is 
stimulated and energized from without inward, through 
its innate creative tendency and its interest in ¢hings. 
The idea not to be lost sight of is, that manual train- 
ing means mind training through the hands: training 
of the hands themselves is the means, rather than the 
end, in a scheme of general education. 
‘ 
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 
Although ‘“tellectual education has been provided 
for among civilized peoples for two or three thousand 
years, even a cursory study of history will show that it 
has not been made to include, until quite recent times, 
either the masses of the people or all the intellectual 
capacities of the individual. Now the fact is recog- 
nized and emphasized in every modern system of edu- 
cation, that the poor and the rich, the hand laborer 
and the brain laborer, alike have a right to intellectual 
development and culture. 
And it has come to seem axiomatic, that a// the 
intellectual powers should be developed and trained. 
One time, not so long ago, it seemed to be thought, that, 
if memory were sufficiently developed and crammed, the 
duty of the educator was fully done; and most teach. 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  
APPLICATIONS TO FORMAL EDUCATION. 253 
ing proceeded on the idea, that, if the memory could be 
sufficiently filled with facts, the culture of the whole 
mind would somehow follow. 
/ It is now recognized that not only should all the 
powers of the intellect be cultivated, but that they 
should be cultivated in that order which the best psy- 
chological investigation has shown that they follow in 
natural development. The order of this development, 
and the relative intensity of the three groups of mind 
activities, at different ages, are illustrated by Diagram 1. 
It is to be regretted that there are not enough statistics 
at hand to enable the lines to be drawn as exact max- 
ima and minima. 
   Age 0. 
DIAGRAM I. 
On the base line of the diagram are indicated the 
successive ages of childhood, adolescence, and maturity. 
The curves show the relative development of the ac- 
quisitive, the assimilative, and the expressive powers, at 
different periods. It would not be far from the truth 
to say that not only relatively, but absolutely, more 
knowledge is acquired in the first twelve years of life 
than in any twelve years thereafter. 
The assimilative powers reach their maturity after 
the acquisitive, and somewhat earlier than the express-  
-P-A-G-E-254
  254 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
ive, and all are capable of the highest activity in the 
“middle years of life.” The diagram is intended to 
indicate the relative activity of the mental powers, and 
not the actual amount of work done by them; for the 
quantity of knowledge-material gathered by the ac- 
quisitive powers is always greater than can be fully 
assimilated, and more can be assimilated than can be 
expressed. 
In accordance. with these facts, provision should be 
made for acguisttional exercises and studies during the 
first eight years of school life, assuming the child to be 
four years old when he enters the kindergarten; for 
assimilational exercises and studies, from about the 
beginning of the high school year, through the college; 
and for expressional studies and exercises, from the 
freshman year in college, through the university course. 
It must be clearly understood that no attempt is 
made here to draw any hard-and-fast line of demarca- 
Relative tion. between mental powers, school years, 
Emphasis. or studies. It is simply meant, that, during 
the first years of school life, emphasis should be laid 
on acquisitional studies; during youth, assimilational 
exercises should be made prominent; and in early 
adult life, the expressional studies should receive the 
emphasis. All three kinds of studies and exercises 
should, of course, be carried on concurrently, even in 
primary schools; but one kind should occupy the larger 
place in the curriculum at one time, another at another 
time. The proportionate stress to be put upon the 
different classes of studies in the several grades of ad- 
vancement is approximately indicated by Diagram 2.

several agencies of formal education. The curves show

the relative emphasis put upon the different classes of 
studies in the various grades of schools. 
/ According to the definition given in Chapter I., teach- 
ing consists in znstructing, developing, training. These 
\three things, consciously done by the teacher, corre- 
spond severally to the three operations of the growing 
mind. Instructing (giving information) corresponds to 
acquisition ; developing (increasing power) corresponds 
to assimilation, for there can be no growth or gain in 
power except through assimilation; training (resulting 
in skill) corresponds to expression. Primary studies and 
exercises, then, and the work of the primary teacher, 
should be planned in the main, for instruction, to fur- 
nish the pupil with abundant knowledge suzted to his 
capacity to retain and assimilate. The actual amount 
of instruction given should not only not be diminished, 
but increased, in the secondary school and college; but 
relatively there should be much more study and teach- 
ing designed to develop the mental powers. So, while 
the quantity of assimilational (developing) work in- 
creases through the college and university, the amount
-P-A-G-E-256
  256 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
of expressional studying and teaching should be large 
in the college, and even in the high school, and should 
reach a maximum both relative and absolute in the 
university or professional school. Diagram 3 puts

MoRAL EDUCATION. 
Although the need that the school should educate 
morally as well as intellectually has long been recog- 
nized, and various attempts have been made to supply 
that need,-yet the matter of ethical training and char- 
acter building has never received so much attention as 
now. (To-day it is generally agreed that ethical educa- 
tion is of the first importance. ) The experience of the 
past half century has shown that intellectual education 
alone does not make upright men and women, nor does 
it relieve the congestion of prisons and reformatories, 
Nor has intellectual education plus a revived phys- 
ical training effected more than intellectual education 
alone, in the improvement of moral character: indeed, 
some of the many physical-education fads, both in and 
out of the schools, may be said with truth to be having
-P-A-G-E-257
  APPLICATIONS TO FORMAL EDUCATION. 257 
a contrary effect. (Moral education must be added to 
bodily training and intellectual cultivation, in order to 
secure a sound and sturdy moral growth. ) 
/- The general method in moral education is the same 
( as in intellectual: there must be instruction, develop- 
\ment, training. Ethical facts must be placed jyotnoain 
before thespupil: he must perceive and feel Moral Edu- 
their significance, their relations tohim; and ‘°*#°?- 
the will must be habituated to prompt determination, 
and execution. 
The question whether there should be specific rel 
gious teaching in public schools will probably continue 
to be partially answered by legislation in some commu- 
nities, by popular sentiment or prejudice in others. | The 
answer psychology gives, is that right moral education 
and sound intellectual education are inseparably bound 
up together; the religious nature is a very real part of 
the mental life of the human being, and therefore its 
cultivation is necessary to a well-rounded education. 
Psychology also plainly shows that in the moral edu- 
cation of the young the “ere and not the hereafter, deeds 
and’ not creeds, should receive the emphasis.

garten to be shortened a full year. The columns covered 
by braces show the three main groups of studies and 
exercises,—the acquisitional, the assimilational, and 
the expressional, —with their subdivisions. The right- 
hand column indicates that the earliest work in every 
branch is, on the teacher’s side, largely instructing; 
that between the grammar school and the university it is 
largely developing ; and that through the university it 
is training. When the child enters the primary school, 
he knows a /t¢le of everything; he knows something 
of science, of numbers, and of language and the humani- 
ties. It is the business of the school, all the way up, 
to use what the pupil knows as a means of interpreta- 
tion and correlation of what is unknown and unfamiliar. 
Up to and through at least the first half of the college 
course, the aim should be a general education, —instruc- 
tion in the principal elements of human knowledge, 
development of all the powers of body and mind, and 
some general training. During the last half of the col- 
lege course, the student should be allowed to specialize 
somewhat, in preparation for the work of the university. 
In the university the work should be mainly in some 
chosen specialty, wherein training, the cultivation of 
skill in some particular thing, should be the prime object. 
Psychology shows, then, that in arranging the courses 
of study in a system of schools, there is a chrono- 
| logical order to be followed, based not only chronotogi- 
| on the fact that mind grows, but on the ‘él Order. 
deeper fact that it grows by the development of differ- 
ent powers at different times and at varying rates. 
For the same reason, a chronological order should be 
observed in the arrangement of the curriculum of the 
individual school. In the first third of the. course,
-P-A-G-E-260
  
260 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
acquisitional studies should predominate; in the second, 
assimilational; and in the last third, expressional. 
But there should also be, in the individual school, a 
concurrent arrangement; that is, an arrangement which 
Concurrent Provides for the pursuit of the three kinds 
Arrange- of studies at the same time. This is simply 
ment. a restatement of the proposition, that though 
at one stage of formal education acquisitional studies 
should receive the main emphasis, yet the assimilational 
and the expressional should receive due attention also. 
Approximately stated, in the primary and grammar 
schools the proportionate division of time would be, to 
acquisitional studies one half to two thirds, to assimila- 
tional and expressional together one third to one half; 
in the high school and college, to assimilational studies 
one half to two thirds, to the others one third to one 
half; in the university,,to expressional studies one 
half to two thirds, to the others one third to one half. 
A division of work corresponding to the tripartite 
manifestation of the mental energy ramifies still more 
minutely into the exercises of the school. Every study 
presents new facts, new ideas, new words, for the 
student to acguire and assimilate; and he should be 
required adequately to express his own thought about 
these, in his own language. And in assigning each les- 
son, the teacher provides a definite amount of subject- 
matter to be acquired and assimilated, and should 
carefully test the result of the pupil’s study by his 
expression in the recitation. 
CONCENTRATION. 
By the term concentration is meant, in modern peda- 
gogy, the relating and unifying of the subjects in a 
   
-P-A-G-E-261
  APPLICATIONS TO FORMAL EDUCATION. 261 
course of study, and of the facts in the mind of the 
learner. 
Tompkins admirably expresses the idea in his defini- 
tion of the correlation of studies: “Correlation, then, 
is putting such subjects side by side at a given time in 
the course as will help to bring to view the universal 
relations involved in the study of any one of them.” 
It has been repeatedly emphasized throughout these 
pages, that no fact standing alone is valuable, that only 
as its relations to other facts are perceived can’ it be 
understood and made of use. This truth must be kept | 
in mind in arranging every course of study, in planning 
every exercise, in conducting every recitation. 
No subject should be taught as complete or valuable 
in itself: the mutual relations of all subjects should be 
constantly pointed out and illustrated. The ,, sanieet 
value, in the practical affairs of life, of read-  Vatuable 
ing, spelling, writing, and arithmetic, should “°° 
be shown to the beginner by numerous illustrations; 
the young student of geography, history, and civics, 
should have made plain to him their interrelations, and 
their practical value to the individual and to society. 
In more advanced work, the usefulness of mathematics 
in every field of investigation, the utility as well as the 
beauty of the natural and experimental sciences, should 
be clearly shown; and every student of the modern or 
classical languages should be led to see and enjoy 
the close kinship of language, literature, logic, and 
philosophy. 
No recitation should be conducted as complete in 
itself: each lesson should be fitted on to. appiication 
what has preceded and to what is to follow. te Recitation. 
Each recitation should begin with a brief review of
-P-A-G-E-262
  262 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
what has been gone over recently, and should close 
with a “preview” of the next work. 
It is a fact, noted often by the observant teacher, 
that a pupil is not able to apply his spelling-book 
knowledge of spelling when he comes to write a note; 
that he may be excellent in text-book arithmetic, but 
very poor in the solution of practical problems outside 
the book; that he may make perfect recitations in the 
geography class, but be unable to locate the places he 
reads of in history. Concentration, or correlation, is 
necessary, not only because facts must be related in 
consciousness in order to be understood, but Concentra- é tion an Aid also because they must be related in order 
tue) to be retained and recalled by memory. It 
was shown in Chapter VII. that the laws 
of association, or memory, may be all comprehended 
under the one law of relation. “Ideas, just as soldiers, 
need to be mobilized speedily in order to meet a spe. 
cific demand;” and the “mobilization” of ideas de. 
pends on their being related. To be educated means, 
for one thing, to be able to summon all one’s knowl- 
edge in any given case, and to summon it quickly. 
The student’s comprehension of the interdependence 
and interrelation of, all branches of knowledge will, of 
Depart. Course, depend in very large measure upon 
mental the kind of teaching he receives. In this 
Teaching truth lies an evil of what is called “depart- 
mental teaching,’ by which is meant teaching by 
specialists, each employed to teach but one branch. 
The specialist — whether a teacher of drawing or music 
in a system of city schools, or a delver into the minutie 
of some subject in a university — is too prone to know 
no branch and value no branch but his own, and there-  
-P-A-G-E-263
  
APPLICATIONS TO FORMAL EDUCATION. 263 
fore to make no attempt, in teaching it, to relate it to 
any other. 
Although, as said above, concentration depends 
largely upon the teacher, yet a great deal may be 
done through a well-arranged text-book to ¢o.centra- 
show the connection of subjects of study, tion in the 
especially in the lower grades. One very 7**B°* 
valuable book, for instance, shows the teacher how to 
combine number work and nature study, and it has 
been suggested that the idea narrowly applied in this 
book may easily and successfully be carried further, 
and that, in the primary grades at least, all the matter 
suited to a certain grade may be put into one book, 
thus securing the teaching of the different branches 
in their proper relations. Such a text-book would be 
welcomed by the inexperienced teacher, who could use 
it to much advantage; and the skillful teacher could 
use it at least equally as well as he can use several 
different books. 
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT. 
As psychology furnishes the principles by which any 
consistent arrangement of educational systems and 
school courses must be made, so it also furnishes the 
principles of a rational and effective administration of 
the individual school as a whole, and constitutes the 
basis of a scientific methodology by which the work 
of teaching may best be done. 
The elementary principles of school management 
have peen somewhat emphasized incidentally at vari- 
ous ee in the preceding chapters, and but little 
more need be said here. The basic principles by 
which the organization of a school is made effective   
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  264 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
are essentially the same for the university as for the 
kindergarten. The fundamental factor is zzteres¢ ; and 
the primary principle, including all others, which 
addresses itself to the teacher, whether the leader of a 
kindergarten game or the president of a university, is, 
“ Secure the interested activity of your pupils, and their 
sympathetic cooperation in the work you are trying to 
do for them.” If this be done, no “ discipline” will be 
necessary. To act in accord with this principle is for 
the teacher to be genuinely interested himself, and to 
make his pupils feel that he is working both for and 
with them, with common aims and purposes. The 
worst thing that can happen in school administration, 
is for the teacher or faculty and the students to become 
polarized, — mutually antagonistic in aims and methods. 
It is true in a college or in a country school, that, when 
the esprit de corps of the students is aroused against a 
faculty or a teacher, the result is destructive of all true 
growth and good order. 
The detailed discussion of effective school adminis- 
tration falls within the department of pedagogy gen- 
erally called “school management,”’a science and art 
necessarily based largely on psychology. 
Another department of pedagogy. is methodology. 
This will receive general treatment in the following 
chapter.

TIME was when the teacher and his employers were 
content if he knew the “three R’s” moderately well? 
But the idea, once almost universally prevalent, that 
knowledge of the branches to be taught is all that is 
necessary to the equipment of a teacher, —that to know 
a thing is to be able zo teach it,—is now held only by 
the uninformed. 
One who knows arithmetic thoroughly is not neces- 
sarily able, by reason of that knowledge, hopes 
to teach arithmetic well. Skill in teaching atone is not 
grammar is not a consequence of a sound ‘"°ve" 
knowledge of grammar. 
Nor is ability to teach made up of a thorough knowl- 
edge of subject-matter p/ws a knowledge of the modes 
of growth and the operations of the mind. A man 
may have full and exact knowledge of anatomy and 
physiology; he may, in addition, know the character 
and specific effect of every drug in the pharmacopeeia; 
and yet he may be utterly unable to diagnose a disease, 
or prescribe the proper remedies. To be a physician, 
he must know not only the anatomy and functions of 
the bodily organs, and the effects of drugs and ways of 
living, but he must also know how to’ diagnose and 
prescribe, how and when to apply the remedies that 
will cause a diseased organ to react into normal func- 
tioning, or prevent its becoming abnormal.
-P-A-G-E-266
  266 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
The teacher must know the three M’s, — Matter, 
Mind, Method. To knowledge of the subject-matter, 
and knowledge of mind and mind growth, he must add 
knowledge of how to bring subject-matter and growing 
mind into such contact as shall cause mind to react 
normally on knowledge-material, and to acquire, assimi 
late, and express. 
A teacher with good method and limited knowledge 
will do far better work than one with full, knowledge 
and poor method: without method he is not a teacher 
at all, no matter how much subject-matter he knows. 
Dr. Laurie says, “The doctrine of method is the last 
chapter in the theory or science of education, and the 
The Value first chapter of the art or practice of educa- 
of Method. tion.” The practical value of methodology 
cannot be better stated than in two more of Dr. Laurie’s 
crisp sentences: “It is necessary to instruct according 
to method, if our instruction is to be sound and sure, 
and, above all, if we are to train and discipline mind. 
And this is the point to emphasize, that training and 
discipline are greater than knowledge, and that only by 
sound method can we train and discipline faculty.” 
A legitimate inference from this is, that to secure 
that development and training which it is the business 
Methoa Of a general, as distinct from a special, edu- 
more than Cation to give, the method of teaching is of 
Matter. more value than the matter of instruction. 
And this is true, provided the matter of instruction, 
whatever it is, is suited to the advancement and capacity 
of the student, and furnishes stimulus and nutriment 
to all the mind’s activities. 
The manner of knowing is, within these limits, of 
more value in mental growth than the ¢hings known.
-P-A-G-E-267
    METHODOLOGY. 267 
For knowledge to be valuable, either from the utili- 
tarian standpoint or from the culture standpoint, it 
must be not merely £vown, but must be correlated, 
classified, and interfused and illuminated by the per- 
sonality of the individual knowing it. The highest 
value of knowledge, or its worthlessness, is in this z¢nz¢ 
of personality which is the essence of the manner of 
knowing. 
It is not intended here to enter the discussion of the 
relative value of different subjects in a general educa- 
tion ; but it is simply meant that the value of whatever 
is studied in a general curriculum lies more in the 
manner of learning and knowing than in the knowledge 
itself. 
The manner of knowing depends greatly upon 
method in teaching. But the distinction be- method and 
tween method and methods is too. frequently Methods. 
ignored, not only by critics of pedagogical science, but 
by teachers themselves. 
By method is to be understood that body of prin- 
ciples, drawn from a sound psychology, which are 
applicable to all teaching ; by methods are to be under- 
stood the special plans and devices to be used in teach- 
ing a particular branch or subject. 
The teacher who has no sure foundation in method 
is prone to “run to seed” in methods, and will almost 
certainly fall into a mechanical routine of petty devices 
that are as far from real teaching as was the old mem- 
ory cram. A weakness of many normal schools has 
been, that they laid more stress on methods than on 
method. 
Method is obtained mainly by induction from psy 
chology and intelligent experience ; methods are deduc- 
@
-P-A-G-E-268
  
268 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
tions from method, to be applied to particular cases. 
Thus from general method we may deduce a special 
method of teaching science, and still further specialize 
it for physics, or chemistry, or botany. There is a 
“general method to be followed in mathematics, but 
different special methods in arithmetic and algebra. 
Not only has each branch and subject its own meth- 
odology, but there is a special methodology for reci- 
AMethoa. tations, for reviews, for examinations; and 
ology for instructing, developing, training, — each has 
each Branch. it own characteristic method. 
,The teacher must rely more on method than on 
devices; and after deducing a special method, he must, 
in practice, constantly modify his deduction by a knowl- 
edge of the new or unusual factors presented by any 
given problem of teaching. 
It is only with general method, and perhaps a few 
of its more important special applications, that this 
chapter deals. 
PSYCHOLOGICAL vs. LOGICAL METHOD. 
The first fact which the teacher needs to get firmly 
in mind, and to keep aware of in all his teaching, is 
that the logical order of development of a subject is 
not always, not even often, the psychological order. 
The beginner must be taught to read before he 
knows the alphabet or can spell: short sentences and 
words mean something to children, letters do not. 
Yet a logical method would require the letters to be 
first learned, their combination into words next, and 
last of all the building of words into sentences. 
To teach arithmetic logically would be to begin with 
the abstract ideas of unity and number, and from these 
   
-P-A-G-E-269
    
METHODOLOGY. | 26g 
to unfold all number relations and processes. To teach 
arithmetic psychologically is to begin with concrete 
things, and show how a number - objects may be 
increased and diminished. 
The logical teaching of geography would begin with 
the form of the earth, its imaginary and real divisions, 
and proceed from these to the description tmustra- 
of the various portions of land and water, tions. 
and the different peoples using them. Geography is 
taught psychologically by beginning with simple forms 
of land and water and phenomena of the atmosphere, 
that are familiar to the child, and leading him to under- 
stand, through these, the larger land and water forms 
and the more complex phenomena of the earth and air. 
History should be taught to the beginner mainly 
in the form of biography and stories, rather than in 
chronological narrative. Civics should begin with the 
simple facts of home government, and be developed 
from these through the school and the local community. 
A logical presentation of physiology would begin 
with the cells and tissues of the body, and trace their 
combinations into organs and systems. But it would 
be unwise to teach the subject in that way even to 
mature pupils: tissues and cells should be the last 
things studied. The same statement applies also to 
botany and zodlogy. 
All subjects should be introduced, when possible, by 
means of objects; for, psychologically, progress. ig 
from the concrete (the visible and tangible) j.o4 
to the abstract. All first knowledge comes Concrete to 
by way of the senses, and this fact shows “?*@** 
the necessity for objective teaching. Things must be 
seen. and handled before their abstract relations can 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
270 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
be perceived. Many concepts of concrete things must 
things be gained before there can be any abstract 
before notions formed of beauty, utility, or deeper 
Symbols. yelations. 
The child thinks in things and their images before 
he can think in symbols. The concept of six things, 
for example, must be formed before the idea of six as 
an abstract number is possible. A thing or its picture 
must become familiar before the word symbolizing it 
can be understood. 
The teacher must be on guard in his use of the 
object method, however, lest he habituate his pupils 
to depend too much on objects or pictures. If an 
abstract line of thought is to be followed, the pupils 
must be made to ¢hznk it (not thing it) through. 
The principle into which all this may be generalized 
is, The mind learns by passing from the near, the famil- 
iar, the concrete, to the remote, the strangé, the abstract. 
In working by this principle it is necessary to remem- 
ber that the act of learning involves two operations 
of the mind,— acquisition and assimilation. 
teaming The distinction between these as processes 
Acquisition of learning has, it seems, not always been 
cane kept in view by those who have discussed 
method in teaching. 
The mind’s activities are so blended with one another 
that it is not possible to draw hard-and-fast lines be- 
tween its operations or the methods by which they are 
carried on. Acquisition and assimilation go on together 
in the minds of children before they reach school age. 
The mind begins to assimilate almost as soon as it 
begins to acquire. 
But the general truth may be laid down, that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
METHODOLOGY. 271 
method of acquisition is analytic, going from wholes to 
parts. The child and the adult alike acquire facts, 
primary ideas, words, as wholes. A first im- acquisition 
pression isa general one: the mind is not con- is Analytic. 
scious at first of the details. A new sight, a new sound, 
a new taste, are all perceived as. wholes, without refer. 
ence at first to their elements or minor characteristics. 
After we have grown somewhat accustomed to a sensa- 
tion, a feeling, an idea, as a whole, we begin to analyze 
it into its parts or attributes. 
ANALYTIC METHOD. 
Corresponding to the analytic process of learning is 
the analytic method of teaching. A good illustration 
is the sentence method of teaching reading. Short sen- 
tences, preferably made by the children, are written on 
the blackboard, and seen and read as wholes. After 
the pupils become familiar with a number of such sen- 
tences, and can read them easily, they are analyzed into 
words, and the words into sounds and letters. In ele- 
mentary grammar, the parts of speech are given before 
any attempt is made to present their modifications and 
properties. 
It is necessary for the teacher to bear in mind the 
fact that what is to him a part may be to the child a 
whole, and a whole too large to grasp. Parts and 
wholes are relative. The earth, considered with refer- 
ence to its geography, is a whole; with reference to the 
solar system, it is a part. To the child just learning 
to talk, a word is a whole; to the same child, when a 
little older, a sentence is a whole, and the words are 
parts. 
In instructing, therefore, the teacher must be con
-P-A-G-E-272
  272 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
stantly careful to ascertain what concepts the pupil can 
grasp as wholes, and present those first. He must know 
not only how, but when, to give a new idea to his pupils. 
The different ways in which physiology, for example, 
ulustra. Should be presented to pupils of different 
tions. ages will illustrate the last two statements. 
To the child of six or seven, the names and uses of 
one organ at a time are given, as head or hand: to the 
more advanced students, an outline view of the whole 
body should be given first. The child comprehends 
the hand as a whole, the older pupils can grasp the 
concept of the body as a whole. The method of 
teaching is in both cases analytic. 
United States history is taught in primary grades 
by stories and descriptions of persons and places. In 
the higher grades, the subject should be presented so 
that in the first lesson the pupils will get a bird’s-eye 
view of the whole, by periods or epochs. The differ- 
ence lies in what shall be presented as wholes to young 
children, and what to older pupils. 
But no matter how advanced the pupils may be, it 
_will be found best in every case to present a new sub- 
ject by giving them a general view of the whole of it 
first. Any student can work better on details if he has 
some notion of the general content of his subject. We 
can follow a road with better heart and more active 
step if we know in what direction and to what good 
end it leads. 
Analysis precedes assimilation. A thing must be 
examined with reference to its parts and attributes 
Assimilation before we can perceive its relations to other 
is Synthetic. things, and give it a correct classification. 
But the essential act of conception, which is the first
-P-A-G-E-273
METHODOLOGY. 273 
step in assimilation, is a synthesis. To forma concept, 
several attributes must be put together: to form a 
class, several objects must be put together. 
To assimilate, to understand, is to perceive relations 
between things; and the perception of relations con- 
sists in, or at least results in, the synthesizing of two 
or more attributes. When a thing is assimilated, it is 
put in our body of knowledge as a part in the whole. 
Assimilation, as used in the preceding paragraphs, has 
much the same meaning as the Herbartian term apper- 
ception. Elsewhere in this book assimilation is used in 
a wider application; but the processes described are all 
synthetic. Thus, in imagining, we build together vari- 
ous elements to make new images; in willing, we weld 
thoughts and feelings into purpose and action. 
SYNTHETIC METHOD. 
The method of teaching, to secure assimilation, should 
therefore be synthetic. Facts and ideas should be pre- 
sented as parts to be put together, or to be fitted on 
to what has already been learned. It is an excellent 
plan to follow every analysis with a corresponding syn- 
thesis. For example, in physiology, after the body 
has been studied by proceeding from the whole to its 
parts,—to the several systems, organs, tissues, cells, — 
the subject should be reviewed in reverse order, from 
the cells to the whole body. After grammar has been 
gone over by passing analytically from the sentence to 
words and their properties, the pupil should then review 
by beginning with the different parts of speech, and 
putting them into proper relations in the formation of 
elements and sentences. 
The compound term analytico-synthetic is often

used to indicate the intimate connection between the 
two methods, and shows that analysis should precede 
synthesis. 
INDUCTIVE METHOD. 
The inductive method of teaching closely resembles 
the synthetic in that it proceeds from the particular to 
the general, but differs from the synthetic in that it is 
used as a means of reaching general principles and 
rules, while the synthetic method is a means of forming 
concepts and classes. 
The inductive method should be used by the teacher 
in every subject in which principles and rules are to 
‘be taught. And in almost all subjects below those 
belonging to the high school or the college, definztions 
should be developed inductively instead of being given 
ready-made. Definitions and rules are brief generaliza- 
tions of many particular cases, and therefore should be 
arrived at inductively. 
For example, in arithmetic, the processes in the solu- 
tion of problems of a particular class should be given 
in arith. and illustrated, and the pupil should be re- 
metic. quired to use them until he understands 
them; then he is able, and should be required, to 
generalize these processes into rules. The student will 
understand a rule thus made by himself. To have him 
memorize the rules first, though a common practice, 
is indefensible on psychological grounds. That text- 
book in arithmetic is to be preferred which gives very 
few rules, or none at all: the student using such a 
book is forced to formulate his own rules. 
What has been said regarding arithmetic applies 
with equal force to grammar. Technical grammar, 
so often made a chaos of formal definitions, rules, and
-P-A-G-E-275
METHODOLOGY. 275 
exceptions, becomes a delightful subject when made 
an inductive study of the sentence. It should be pre- 
sented to beginners through the sentence; In Gram- 
for from the structure of sentences all needful = ™*"- 
definitions and rules of grammar can be generalized, 
under skillful teaching, by the pupils themselves. 
In teaching definitions inductively (synthetically), 
enough examples of the things (objects or ideas) to be 
defined should be presented, and the pupils Definitions 
led, by noting carefully the common proper- >y Induction. 
ties exhibited, to frame a definition that shall include 
these common properties. For example, by showing a 
class the function of denominators, the pupils may be 
easily led to make the definition, “The denominator 
of a fraction shows the number of equal parts into 
which the unit is divided.” In the same way, a study 
of the function of the transitive verb in a sentence leads 
to the definition, “A transitive verb is a verb that 
expresses action as taking effect upon something.” 
The principle of the inductive method may be thus 
stated: A clear comprehension of processes must pre- 
cede the statement of a rule: a clear concept of a thing 
must precede the framing of a definition of that thing. 
DEDUCTIVE METHOD. 
In deductive method, the rule, or principle, or defini- 
tion, is learned first, and then application is made of it 
to particular cases. It was a method much in vogue 
with the old-time schoolmaster; for it enabled him to 
require memoriter recitations, and, in case a pupil took 
to asking questions, to silence him with the assurance 
that “the rule said so.” Such a method, persistently 
followed, dulls the spirit of inquiry and investigation
-P-A-G-E-276
  276 PSYCHOLOGY 1N EDUCATION. 
in any school. It ignores the fact that the rule is not 
and can not be a reason,—that it does not tell why, 
but how. 
It is wise to use deductive method with advanced 
pupils only. It is not advisable to present a definition 
or rule first in an unfamiliar subject, and have the 
young pupil seek for illustrations and applications. 
And when a ready-made principle or rule is given to 
even advanced students, it should not be given as a 
finality, complete in itself, but only as a guide-post to 
show the direction the work is to take, or as a proposi. 
tion to be proved. 
“CULTURE EPOCHS.” 
Modern method recognizes the fact that the zdz- 
vidual mind in its development repeats the order of 
development of the race mind. 
Mankind, in its progress from a rude and savage 
state, passes through three broadly marked “ culture 
epochs.” In the childhood of the race, myths and 
legends, accounts of demigods and heroes, abound. 
All objects in nature are endowed with personality, 
and natural phenomena are explained as the acts of 
gods or demons. As the race advances, imagination 
and superstition are modified by close observation and 
increasing experience, a beginning is made in empirical 
science, and the practical arts are established. As 
progress continues, pure science takes the place of 
empiricism, and the search for the relations and causes 
of things gives rise to philosophy and speculative 
investigation. 
Civilized man passes through these three stages of 
mind growth in his individual life, and the processes of
-P-A-G-E-277
  
METHODOLOGY. 277 
his education should be in accord with them. For the 
child there should be fairy stories, fables, the personifi- 
cation of natural forces, and true biography of the 
world’s heroes. For the youth there must be much 
observing and experimenting, trial of many things, and 
accumulation of facts in every field of knowledge. 
For the man there must be investigation and inquiry 
into ultimate causes,— the why and how of things. 
A little reflection will show that all that Quis prin- 
has been said so far regarding method can ciple of 
be summed up in the one principle: Zhe Method 
processes of education should conform to the order of 
mind growth. 
OTHER PRINCIPLES DEDUCED. 
From the general principle just stated, and from the 
definition of education given in Chapter I., a few special 
principles and rules of education are next deduced. 
I. All the organs of the body should be developed and 
trained to proper functioning. The application of this 
principle would change current athletic prac- physical 
tices, and put physical education where it Education. 
belongs,—in charge of a teacher trained for that pur- 
pose, and with proper and sufficient apparatus for his 
use. Strict application of the principle would also 
rightly answer a question that has not yet been as 
often raised or as strenuously pressed as it ought to be, 
“Why should not the ft hand be made as service- 
able as the right?” There is no valid reason for not 
training the left hand to be as efficient as the right: 
man should be ambidextrous. 
Il. All the faculties of the mind should be developed 
and trained. The practice of this principle takes the
-P-A-G-E-278
  278 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
emphasis of teaching off of memory, where it has so 
long been placed, and distributes it over the whole 
Intellectual Series of mental activities. The recognition 
Education. of the necessity for an all-round development 
is one of the corner stones of modern education. 
The principle of use is a most important companion 
principle to the one just given, and may be phrased 
thus: Faculties, like muscles, grow strong by use: 
therefore do nothing for the pupil that he can do for 
himself. The beefsteak the teacher eats gives the 
pupil no nourishment. So, the problem solved, the 
word parsed, the sentence diagramed, by the teacher, 
gives the pupil no strength. 
This principle does not mean, be it carefully noted, 
that the teacher shall not show the pupil “ow to work, 
but simply that the pupil shall do his own work when 
he has learned how, and that he can best learn how 
by doing it himself under skillful and sympathetic 
direction. 
Ill. The senses must be developed carly, and trained 
to accurate and quick observation of worthful facts. 
Workers in the field of science are not the only ones 
who need the power of ready and correct observation. 
‘The essayist, the novelist, the poet, the artist, who are 
popularly supposed to be removed from what are called 
practical affairs, must be the closest and most accurate 
of observers. Ruskin’s wonderful power of description, 
and infallible discrimination as an art critic, were due 
to habits of minute observation of nature, formed in 
his boyhood. 
IV. Memory must be developed by use according te 
the laws of association and the law of interest. 
The more interesting associations there are for any
-P-A-G-E-279
METHODOLOGY. 279 
  idea, the more readily can it be retained and recalled. 
Since the interest of children is aroused mainly through 
sense percepts, and since they most readily form sense 
associations, as many of the senses should be called into 
activity as possible in teaching them. For example, 
in reading and spelling, a word should be seen, heard, 
uttered, and written. 
What? When? Where? are the questions for culti- 
vating the ability to observe and recall. 
V. Judgment must be developed and trained by draw- 
ing conclusions from observation and experience, and by 
correlating and unifying objects of knowledge. 
Activity of judgment is manifested by children earlier 
than we are apt to suppose. The child of two or three 
years of age begins to classify objects and to search 
for the reason of things. Why? and How? are the 
questions for training judgment. 
The teacher must be careful to furnish knowledge- 
material xo faster than it can be assimilated. The 
mental digestion can become clogged as readily and 
with as serious results as can the physical. 
VI. Imagination is to be cultivated through observa- 
tion, and by descriptions of places and things that the 
pupil has had no opportunity to observe. 
These descriptions may be read or told by the teacher 
to the pupil, or they may be read by the pupil for 
himself, or they may be told or written by the pupil. 
No plan for cultivating the imagination is complete 
that does not include much oral and written composi- 
tion, and much reading of good literature. 
The high function of imagination in creating ideals 
of both ethical and non-ethical conduct must not be 
lost sight of,
-P-A-G-E-280
  280 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
VIL. Judgment and taste should be trained early to 
Esthetic 7ecognize and appreciate what ts beautiful 
Education. and refined. 
Environments at home and at school are the chief 
agencies in esthetic education: it cannot be had from 
books or set lessons. 
Like all the more spiritual tastes and feelings, the 
esthetic taste is best cultivated indirectly rather than 
by direct instruction. Nature, art, and literature are 
the three influences that form and refine the love 
of the beautiful. 
ae cat VIII. The ethical nature must be developed 
Education. gyd refined through the motives. 
Right doing is mainly a matter of feeling, not only 
with children, but with adults. One rarely does right 
because he £zows (intellectually) what is right: he must 
also feel the necessity of right conduct. 
If man always found in rational conviction sufficient 
motive to both non-ethical and ethical action, he could 
well dispense with a majority of his feelings. He would 
not, for instance, after reaching years of discretion, need 
the physical appetites or feelings of physical comfort 
and discomfort, to compel him to repair the waste of the 
body or to protect it against accidents. So he would 
need no motive to ethical conduct except the decision 
of judgment that certain acts are right. But the sim- 
ple conviction that a thing is right — which is the high- 
est motive to doing right—is so ineffective, that it 
requires the impelling force not only of conscience, but 
of a host of other feelings, to induce men to follow 
righteousness. 
The teacher, the preacher, the lawmaker, all who 
would guide and reform humanity, are forced to run
-P-A-G-E-281
  
METHODOLOGY. 281 
the scale of motives from the highest to the lowest. 
Through the motives the will is brought to act,—to 
inhibit, to determine, to execute. 
Most luckily there can be no ¢ext-book on morals, and 
therefore moral education cannot easily become, in the 
hands of the teacher, a daily lesson-grind. The teacher 
himself, if his life is right, is the best daily lesson in 
morals. 
IX. The will must be developed through interest, so 
that it can quickly and steadily focus the mind in 
attention. 
The power to attend is perhaps the highest intel- 
lectual power, and no effort should be spared in culti- 
vating it in the young. The effect of it, or the lack of 
it, is far-reaching in every sphere of human activity. 
It is through the power of the will to compel atten- 
tion that it becomes able also to choose, determine, 
and execute. 
Development of the will means also the full culti- 
vation of the motives. The teacher should choose 
what motives he will have dominant in school, and 
early set about to make them dominant. To do this is 
to develop will, and to develop will is to build character. 
X. Thoroughness ts often best secured by ynorough- 
indirect teaching. — 
All teachers believe thoroughness to be essential, 
and it is; but the way most used to secure it is not 
always the best. Repeated drilling upon lessons until 
the facts are well fixed in memory, important as it is, 
does not secure true thoroughness; for to know “by 
heart” is not necessarily to be thorough. 
To be thorough is to understand ; and a pupil cannot 
understand a lesson or a subject fully until he has some
-P-A-G-E-282
282 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
knowledge of the next higher one. A student cannot 
be thorough in arithmetic, for example, until he knows 
something of algebraand geometry. The pupil should 
be passed to the next lesson or the next higher subject 
as soon as he knows the facts, and understands the 
principles, of the lower study suffictently to enable him 
to apply them in the higher. 
This seems self-evident, but it is not so treated in 
practice. Pupils are kept grinding over the same grist 
in order to become “thorough.” But they get further 
away from true thoroughness at each going-over. It 
is better for the pupil to go into a new and more 
advanced subject, even if he finds it necessary to refer 
frequently to the books or lessons just laid aside. Not 
only does he, in a new subject, have both the stimulus 
of new facts to call forth greater mental activity, and 
the helpful consciousness of progress, but he is also 
forced to use his partially acquired knowledge of the 
less advanced subject in mastering the higher. The 
mind is thus brought to a tension adove what is neces- 
sary for the comprehension of the lower study, and so 
more readily becomes thorough in it. 
The teacher is losing time and wasting energy when 
he tries to produce thoroughness by direct teaching 
alone. To illustrate: A pupil should not be 
kept on the multiplication table till he can 
say it all without a slip, but as soon as he knows the 
table, or a part of it, fairly well, he should be put to 
work on simple problems in the solution of which mul- 
tiplication is a necessary but secondary process. As 
soon as the pupil has some familiarity with geography, 
he should have history presented:to him in a way that 
assumes his knowledge of geography. Illustrations,
-P-A-G-E-283
METHODOLOGY. 283 
As long as the multiplication table is taught as an 
end in itself, the mind of the learner will be keyed up 
only to that point; but when a problem is set that 
involves multiplication as a subs¢diary process, the mind 
becomes keyed to the more difficult work, and thus 
thoroughness is zzdirectly reached in the minor matter. 
Constant drilling in geography would result in strong 
aversion to that subject; but if history and general 
reading be so taught as to demand accuracy of geo- 
graphical knowledge as a subsidiary matter, the result 
must be true thoroughness in geography. 
In the truth of this principle lies the excellence of sup- 
plementary reading. If the pupil is kept in the second 
reader, for example, until he can read it through without 
miscalling a word, he isa loser thereby. If put to work 
in supplementary reading matter, he shows marked im- 
provement, because he now reads for the thought, and the 
mere calling of words becomes of secondary importance. 
But after the last word is said in methodol- spapatne 
ogy, this truth remains: sympathy isthe chief the Chief 
element in the success of the real teacher. "*™"™* 
He who lacks sympathy for the learner in his efforts, 
in his failures, in his successes, in his struggle for self- 
mastery, will fall short of the best teaching. Old 
teachers who have grown out of memory of their own 
early difficulties, teachers who teach “for revenue 
only,” and those who have blundered in their choice of 
the teacher’s profession, usually lack this element. 
There is no higher work than teaching ; and he who 
does not appreciate this truth, who does not love to 
see mind grow and to help it grow and know, has no 
rightful place in the ranks of those who are consecrat- 
ing the schools to the cause of humanity.

CHAPTER XXI. 
METHODS AND RECORDS OF MIND STUDY. 
In Chapter I. a very brief mention was made of some 
methods of studying mind phenomena. In succeed- 
ing chapters an attempt was made to discuss a few 
results of mind study and their specific application to 
education. It is hoped that the teacher, and possibly 
others whose work is both with and upon mind, have 
found enough therein to quicken an interest in the 
more detailed description which this chapter presents, 
of the observational method of studying mind, and 
recording the results for the teacher and the sociologist. 
Dr.Hall, one of the most earnest investigators of mind 
growth, suggests that the studies made by physicians, 
Classification 22thropologists, sociologists, parents, and 
ofMind teachersin this field, should be grouped under 
Studies. (1) studies of psychogenesis, or mind begin- 
nings, in children up to three or four years of age; (2) paz- 
dology, or child science, a study of the child up to eleven or 
thirteen years of age ; (3) ephedics, or the study of youth. 
These are rather high-sounding names, but it is 
doubtful whether anything of great value has been 
done or will be done under them that has not been 
done in a simple and very effective way by sympa- 
thetically observant teachers for a great many years 
past. A reading of what has been written latterly upon 
the subject of mind study reveals a tendency to lay
-P-A-G-E-285
METHODS AND RECORDS OF MIND STUDY. 285 
rather too much stress upon psycho-physic investiga- 
tion. The gathering and publishing of mere statistics 
of weight, size, and other physical charac- 4... wach 
teristics, seem to engross too much attention. Stress on 
Nothing seems too trivial to be made matter S**#tss- 
of record, if it can be measured or weighed. The zeal 
of some of the present-day investigators carries them 
to almost absurd extremes. Judging by the very sol- 
emn way in which so many trifles are announced, it 
would seem that some men and women had never 
observed children with any particularity or interest 
until induced to do so through the fad for studying 
psychology with a tapeline. 
Thousands of school children in Boston, St. Louis, 
Milwaukee, and other cities, have been weighed, and 
measured as to height, size of chest, size of head, and 
rate of growth. The results have been tabulated with 
statistics of age, sex, parentage, occupation of parents, 
etc. From the masses of facts thus accumulated, but 
few definite conclusions have been drawn; in fact, as 
might be expected, different conclusions have been 
drawn from the same data. Some, if not most, of 
these inductions, can be reached by sympathetic and 
observant teachers, from the daily appearance, play, 
conduct, and class work of their pupils, with- ae 5 .__, No special out subjecting them to any kind of physical Need of Phys- 
measurement. The chief value of the cur- ical Meas- urement. 
rent free discussion of this subject lies in the 
opportunity it affords for individual observers to become 
more conscious in their observations, to record and 
compare results, and thus to work together toward the 
production of a body of classified psychological data 
from which inductions may be made that will benefit all. 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
286 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
Some of the conclusions already reached, while 
doubtless correct and to some extent interesting, seem 
to have little or no value for the teacher. For exam- 
ple, what pedagogical worth has the fact that the chil- 
dren of manual laborers are lighter and shorter, age for 
age, than those of merchants or lawyers? What use 
can the teacher make of the knowledge that American 
children are a trifle lighter than children of foreign 
parentage? We get very little from the use of the 
scales, tapeline, and calipers, that we do not already 
know. At least a little observation will reveal it to 
us with an exactness sufficiently close for the practical 
needs of the teacher. A teacher does not have to 
study medicine or anthropometry to discover that a 
child is oversized or undersized for his age, or that he 
has defective sight or hearing. He does not need 
either a physician or a psychologist to tell him to put 
a pupil of poor hearing closer to the teacher’s desk 
than those of normal hearing.’ We know that a 
healthy child is active, vigorous, and heavier than a 
sickly child of the same age, and that as a rule he can 
learn better than a child of enfeebled health. The 
physiological psychologist has discovered nothing bet- 
ter than that empirical knowledge. 
But in every new science there must be a long period 
of fact collecting before there can be any Facts must : : 
be gathered trustworthy announcement of new principles; 
pee and in collecting facts there will be, of 
course, much chaff gathered with the grain.   
1 The following is quoted from an address by a physician to a body 
of (presumably) intelligent teachers: ‘‘ It is particularly important that 
the teacher should notice this form of deafness [due to abnormal 
growth in the back of the nose]. Children deaf should be placed 
near the teacher.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  METHODS AND RECORDS OF MIND STUDY. 287 
The criticism of the last few paragraphs is not di- 
rected as much against the making and recording of 
many and various observations upon children and adults, 
as against the too prevalent practice of announcing 
facts as valuable in themselves, instead of ‘patiently 
generalizing them into helpful principles. Darwin gath- 
ered and studied facts for some twenty years before 
he announced his development hypothesis: the psycho- 
physic investigator is prone to rush into print every 
time he finds a new fact, or rediscovers an old one. 
It will surely take some time to work out a usable 
formula that shall involve the factors of size, weight, 
rate of growth, age, sex, and nativity. There ,, Working * 
are so many other factors of equal or greater Formula 
importance that enter into the practical solu- Ps”! 
tion of educational problems, that it may be seriously 
questioned whether anything like a formula can ever be 
worked out. It does not seem likely that we shall ever 
be able to say that skill in mathematics varies as the 
weight of the pupil; or that aptitude in natural science 
is directly as the square of the chest measurement ! 
But there can be no doubt that the right kind of 
observations on children (psychic rather than psycho- 
physic), systematically carried on and care- Pagchin 
fully recorded, are of great value not only in Observations 
the slow development of acceptable peda- Pere 
gogical laws, but also in the immediate and everyday 
work of the average teacher. 
The teacher should be a sociologist also, and should 
teach as a sociologist, as one whose work is not for the 
individual alone, but for the community, — for the indi- 
vidualasamemberof society. In properly directed mind 
study he will find much that can help him, not only in

his service for individual pupils, but in his work for 
them as members of the social organism. Even the 
most absurd things that have been done and written in 
thename of “the child” will be justified, if no other good 
should result from the greatly quickened interest in child 
study that has marked the last decade or two than the 
focusing of the attention of laymen, educators, and the 
everyday teacher, upon the child as the center of educa- 
tional theory and the object of educational practice. 
Observations upon children should be made and 
recorded by both parents and teachers, and may be

fons. Under abnormalcharacteristics may be placed 
observations of (1) overgrowth or undergrowth, with or 
without specific disease; (2) defective sense equipment 
(defective sight, hearing, etc.); (3) precocity or unusual 
dullness of all or of any one of the mental activities. 
Under normal characteristics should be placed observa- 
tions upon the natural, healthy growth of the different 
bodily and mental organs and faculties. 
Observations upon the irregular or defective bodily 
growth, or upon any abnormal physical condition of 
children, can of course be made accurately only by a 
physician. In some of the large cities of both Europe 
and America, physicians are employed whose business 
it is to make examinations and tests at stated inter- 
vals upon the physical condition of the school chil- 
dren. The best that can be done in that direction 
by the average teacher, is to be alert to discover symp- 
toms of defective sense perception or of disease, and 
immediately to call the attention of the parents to any 
aberrancy. Some suggestions as to simple tests for

defects of the sensorium have been made in previous 
chapters, and doubtless enough has been said to enable 
the teacher to plan other exercises and tests suited to 
the needs of individual cases with which he may have 
to deal. 
Teachers will find more that is valuable and helpful 
in observations made upon normal cases of develop- 
ment than upon abnormal ones. If normal 
types be studied as they should be, any eine 
deviations therefrom will become sufficiently Important 
evident. As Rooper says, “It is the normal ,,\?2" 
action of child mind that is being studied, 
and not the abnormal and remarkable. The abnormal 
should only be recorded as throwing light on the nor- 
mal, and should be distinctly noted as abnormal.” 
The study of children should begin in the home, and 
almost at the hour of birth. Mothers have the richest 
opportunities for observation and record of 6, ..,yations

If they would everywhere systematically ™°™* 
undertake this work, much could be done in accumu- 
lating facts that would have the highest value for both 
the sociologist and the teacher. 
Some excellent books have been issued, setting forth 
the results obtained by careful observation made upon 
infants. Much of value can also be had by careful 
gleaning from the mass of current literature on the 
subject of child study, albeit a great deal of this is of 
questionable worth to the teacher.’

I want again in this connection to lay stress upon the 
fact that mere statistics are of little or no value: it is 
what can be drawn from them that is to profit the stu- 
dent of mind phenomena; and, in order to have any 
worth for this purpose, they should be recorded as the 
observations are made, and with the exactness of the 
investigator who is searching for truth in the facts,

This form is intended for popular rather than for 
expert use, and it is not expected that much deliberate 
experimentation will be done, though some would prove 
very interesting and helpful to even the non-expert. 
In the “remarks” most careful note should be made 
of any hereditary peculiarities. Points under this would 
have especial value in aiding the solution of the prob- 
lem whether peculiarities of any kind acquired by the 
parents can be transmitted to the children. Under 
“parentage,” “father’s occupation,” and “locality” the 
social and industrial environment of the child should 
be fully stated. It should be noted whether the town 
is a mining, or manufacturing, or purely commercial 
town: whether the country is fertile or poor, and what 
the chief agricultural interest is, etc. If the mother 
also is engaged in money earning, either in the home 
or out of it, that fact.should be noted. All these are 
the factors which, as has been said before, make it 
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reach, from 
such data, any widely applicable generalization that 
will have the force of law,

BRIEFER FORMS. 
The forms just given are intended, as they show, for 
rather detailed work, which may serve to aid in the 
discovery of general laws or principles, as well as to 
produce immediate results. It is advisable, in most 
instances, to select types of children differing in age, 
parentage, sex, etc., and make these detailed observa- 
tions only upon them. The results will be fully as 
satisfactory and as useful for purposes of generalization 
as if every child should be put on record, and the work 
can be more quickly done.

A little has been done toward making similar but 
briefer observations and records serve as a means of 
watching and guiding the growth of children in school, 
and as the basis of promotion through the classes and 
grades. A very simple form, slightly changed from 
the one used in the schools of Bellevue, Ky., will serve 
as an example.

  METHODS AND RECORDS OF MIND STUDY. 299 
An even simpler record was used in the Platteville, 
Wis., State Normal School. The following illustra- 
tions, records of three different pupils, are quoted from 
an article on “Child Study,” by Miss Mary E. Laing, 
in the “ Forum ”of May, 1894:— 
Oct. 1.— Age, 8 years; good mind; sensitive, reticent, sometimes 
covers this with an air of bravado; a careless worker. Jan. 17,.— 
Improved habits in work, in conduct, and in thought; realizing his 
possibilities rapidly. Mar. 18.— Has been doing good, even work; 
much interested in natural science. May 24.— Not working up to 
the level of his power; careless about form; all hand work poorly 
done; frequent lapses in attention; a child who lives in a world of 
his own. 
Oct. 12,— Age, 10; dreamy and absent-minded ; a good thinker 
when aroused ; he has never done his best ; does not know what real 
work is. Jan 15.— Excellent improvement; more at one with his 
class ; less absent-minded and listless; a child with a good mind, 
but with irregular mental habits ; inclined to jump at conclusions. 
Mar. 22.— He has made little gain during the last quarter ; he is still 
inclined to inattention and listlessness. May 24.— Work still uneven, 
though much improved; he observes well, reasons well; better 
habits of attention ; improved bearing. 
Oct. 20.— Age, 15 years. Good natural ability, with good general 
knowledge ; an observing mind; thoughtless in manner; always 
truthful. Jan. 25.— Has improved in work, but not in self-control ; 
inclined to try for leadership among his boy companions. Mar. 24.— 
No moral growth; inclined to think too well of himself; marked 
symptoms of forwardness and conceit. 
It is easy to see the direct benefit to the individual 
pupil of such records, but there is even greater benefit 
to the teacher. Miss Laing says, “Everything, then, 
that helps the young teacher to become a practical 
daily student of child nature, is for him the best pos- 
sible training in the science and art of education.” 
Principal Russell of Worcester, Mass., who devised a 
similar plan of observation and record, also says, “The 
practice of child study is directly for the sake of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
  300 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
teacher, indirectly for the sake of the child, and inci- 
dentally for the sake of science.” Of course, any benefit 
the teacher derives from such work must eventually 
reach the child also. 
Children should be observed under as many circum~- 
stances as possible, —studying, reciting, working, play- 
ing, etc. Anything is of value that helps to show how 
the mind is quickened into activity, the order of devel- 
opment of the faculties, and the ways in which mental 
activity is manifested. 
UNCLASSIFIED ITEMS OF OBSERVATION. 
Besides the items indicated in the preceding forms, 
there are various others, not readily classifiable, which 
it is profitable to note. Some of these are suggested 
under the following heads: — 
I. Does a pupil do better work under individual teach- 
ing, or in a class with his fellows ? 
Not a little is being said regarding the necessity of 
individual teaching. The experiment of abolishing 
class work as such, and of letting each pupil advance 
as rapidly as his individual effort, directed by the 
teacher, would permit, has been tried to some extent; 
but much more general experimentation is needed to 
establish a principle or a practice in this matter. Ifa 
teacher does not feel justified in trying it with the 
whole school, there are often several pupils of irregular 
advancement with whom the plan of purely individual 
teaching might be properly undertaken. A right an. 
swer to this question will be a solution of the problem 
that faces every city teacher and the majority of country 
teachers; viz., “ How can the brightest pupils in a grade 
or class be kept profitably busy, without overworking 
or discouraging the duller ones?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  
METHODS AND RECORDS OF MIND STUDY. 301 
Il. How may the rhythm in the work and conduct of 
the individual, class, and school, be accounted for ? 
Most teachers have observed that there is an alterna- . 
tion of good and bad work, good and bad behavior, in 
the individual pupils, in classes, and even in the whole 
school. One day or one week excellent work is done, 
excellent behavior is the rule; the next day or the next 
week there seems to be a general “letting down,” work 
is poor, and conduct isabominable. So far as the mat- 
ter has been studied, the explanation seems to be that 
this rhythm is due to more or less regularly periodic 
fluctuations in the power of attention. But this merely 
shifts the question, and does not answer it. More 
knowledge is needed to determine how far such rhythm 
is psychical or physical, to what extent it is due to 
weather changes, how much of it is due to the element 
in human nature which induces one to be lax and self- 
indulgent after a successful effort in any direction. 
III. Ls t better that the sexes at the period of adoles- 
cence should be educated in separate schools ? 
Can girls and boys at this period do their best work 
in the same classes? Should there be any change in 
the quantity or quality of work demanded of them at 
this stage of life? Is the mind more, or less, active than 
at other periods? 
IV. [f the boys and girls are taught together, what 
difference, if any, ts observable in the quality of their 
work ? 
Is there a difference in preference for certain studies? 
Is there a difference in conscientiousness about work? 
Are boys, or girls, more exact? What differences are 
there in the ambitions and trend of zdeals of the two 
sexes? In short, every point should be noticed that is 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
          PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
  302 
likely to throw any light on the psychology of sex. If 
answers can be found to questions III. and IV., they 
will have a profound sociological as well as pedagogical 
interest and value. 
No sound objection can be offered to the co-education 
of both sexes in childhood; little, if any, can be offered 
against their co-education as adults, in the college and 
university; but the question has not yet been conclu- 
sively answered, whether there should be full co-educa- 
tion all the way from the primary to the university. 
Then, too, another question arises in this connection ; 
and that is, “ What difference in the method or sub- 
stance of education should be made, in view of the 
different duties which men and women must neces- 
sarily render to society?” This question has hardly 
been asked yet, and no decided steps have anywhere 
been taken, so far, toward a solution of the problem. 
V. In what ways can the time daily spent in school be 
reduced, to the pupils advantage ? 
Another question in this connection awaits an an- 
swer; and that is, “Are not yearly vacations too long?” 
Every teacher knows that even a short vacation gets 
the pupils out of working harness, and some time is 
needed at the opening of school to get them into 
habits of study. Could not some work be assigned so 
interesting that it would be done during vacation, and 
thus keep the mind interestedly active? This could 
certainly be done if there were the connection there 
ought to be between school work and the pupil’s nor- 
mal life. It is believed that colleges could, under a 
more compact organization and with better teaching 
methods, do more and better work in three years than 
they now do in four.

METHODS AND RECORDS OF MIND STUDY. 303 
RECORD OF METHODS. 
There is probably no grade of school in which the 
teacher would not find it an excellent plan to keep 
records—made at regular intervals, as often as con- 
venient—of the special methods by which he made 
various difficult points clear in different branches, by 
which he succeeded in arousing the interest of a dull or 
indifferent student, by which he reached an obtuse 
moral nature. These records should show the practical 
results of the more detailed series of observations; and 
; by correlating and preserving both together, and add- 
ing to them, the teacher can make for himself a most 
valuable pedagogy. It is very true, of course, that 
making such observations and records will take patience 
and perseverance, but no more than does the current 
system of grading. 
MIND STUDY VS. GRADES AND EXAMINATIONS. 
It is believed that the use of observations and records 
in mind study in school work, both for securing a ra- 
tional basis for true methods of management and teach- 
ing and for determining the promotion of pupils, is 
much to be preferred to any system of set examina- 
tions, and of recording examination results in figures ; 
for, although there is an air of mathematical certainty 
about a grade in figures, yet it is plain that the “personal 
equation” of the teacher or examiner must enter into 
every estimate, and therefore into every grade, he makes. 
There can be no greater error on account of the “per- 
sonal equation,” then, in a system of marking and pro- 
motion by careful observations upon the activity and 
growth of the mental powers, than there is in the preva. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  304 PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
lent system of “per cents.” Then, too, even the best 
system of daily marking or of examining makes but 
little discrimination between what may be called growth 
values of the different mental powers; or at least it 
almost necessarily puts the greatest stress on the 
memory, where it certainly does not belong. 
It is good that the day has come when it is at least 
as interesting to study the child—the growing mind 
—as it is to study geological strata, or chemical reac- 
tions, or the movements of the stars. It is the child 
that is taught, not the subject: the pupil is of more 
value than many text-books. Surely we are getting 
closer to fundamentals when we study that which 
knows, and how it knows, as carefully as we study that 
which is to be known.

        VERTON’S APPLIED PHYSIOLOGIES form a 
series of text-books for primary, grammar, and high 
schools, which departs radically from the old-time 
methods pursued in the teaching of physiology. These books 
combine the latest results of study and research in biological, 
medical, and chemical science with the best methods of 
teaching. 
| The fundamental principle throughout this series is the 
study of the cells where the essential functions of the body 
are carried on. Consequently, the study of anatomy and 
physiology is here made the study of the cells from the most 
elementary structure in organic life to their highest and most 
complex form in the human body. 
| This treatment of the cell principle, and its development 
in its relation to life, the employment of laboratory methods, 
the numerous original and effective illustrations, the clearness of 
the author’s style, the wealth of new physiological facts, and the 
logical arrangement and gradation of the subject-matter, give 
these books a strength and individuality peculiarly their own. 
| The effects of alcohol and other stimulants and narcotics 
are treated in each book sensibly, and with sufficient fullness. 
But while this important form of intemperance is singled out, 
it is borne in mind that the breaking of any of nature’s laws 
is also a form of intemperance, and that the whole study of 
applied physiology is to encourage a more healthful and a 
more self-denying mode of life. 
4 In the preparation of this series the needs of the various 
school grades have been fully considered. Each book is well 
suited to the pupils for whom it is designed.

      UNITED STATES HISTORIES 
By JOHN BACH McMASTER, Professor of American 
History, University of Pennsylvania      
      School History, $1.00 
    
        
  Primary History, $0.60 Brief Histery, $1.00 
    HESE standard histories are remarkable for their 
freshness and vigor, their authoritative statements, 
and their impartial treatment. They give a well- 
proportioned and interesting narrative of the chief events 
in our history, and are not loaded down with extended 
and unnecessary bibliographies. The illustrations are his- 
torically authentic, and show, besides well-known scenes 
and incidents, the implements and dress characteristic of the 
various periods. The maps are clear and full, and well 
executed. 
| The PRIMARY HISTORY is simply and interestingly 
written, with no long or involved sentences. Although brief, 
it touches upon all matters of real importance to schools in 
the founding and building of our country, but copies beyond 
the understanding of children are omitted. The summaries 
at the end of the chapters, besides serving to emphasize the 
chief events, are valuable for review. 
qj In the SCHOOL HISTORY by far the larger part of 
the book has been devoted to the history of the United States 
since 1783. From the beginning the attention of the student 
is directed to causes and results rather than to isolated events. 
Special prominence is given to the social and economic 
development of the country. 
{| In the BRIEF HISTORY nearly one-half the book 
is devoted to the colonial period. The text proper, while 
brief, is complete in itself; and footnotes in smaller type 
permit of a more comprehensive course if desired. Short 
summaries, and suggestions for collateral reading, are provided.

N the new series of these sterling geographies emphasis is laid 
on industrial, commercial, and political geography, with just 
enough physiography to bring out the causal relations. 
| The text is clear, simple, interesting, and explicit. The 
pictures are distinguished for their aptness and perfect illus- 
trative character. Two sets of maps are provided, one for 
reference, and the other for study, the latter having corre- 
sponding maps drawn to the same scale. 
4] The INTRODUCTORY GEOGRAPHY develops the 
subject in accordance with the child’s comprehension, each 
lesson paving the way for the next. In the treatment of the 
United States the physiographic, historical, political, industrial, 
and commercial conditions are taken up in their respective 
order, the chief industries and the localities devoted largely to 
each receiving more than usual consideration. The country 
is regarded as being divided into five industrial sections. 
| In the SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY a special feature is 
the presentation of the basal principles of physical and general 
geography in simple, untechnical language, arranged in num- 
bered paragraphs. In subsequent pages constant reference is 
made to these principles, but in each case accompanied by 
the paragraph number. ‘This greatly simplifies the work, 
and makes it possible to take up the formal study of these 
introductory lessons after the remainder of the book has been 
completed. With a view to enriching the course, numerous 
specific references are given to selected geographical reading.

ARPENTER’S Geographical Readers supplement the 
regular textbooks on the subject, giving life and interest 
to the study. They are intensely absorbing, being 
written by the author on the spots described, and presenting 
accurate pen-pictures of places and peoples. ‘The style is 
simple and easy, and throughout each volume there runs a 
strong personal note which makes the reader feel that he is 
actually seeing everything with his own eyes. 
| The books give a good idea of the various peoples, their 
strange customs and ways ofliving, and to some extent of their 
economic conditions. At the same time, there are included 
graphic descriptions of the curious animals, rare birds, wonder- 
ful physical features, natural resources, and great industries of 
each country. ‘The illustrations for the most part are repro- 
ductions of photographs taken by the author. ‘The maps show 
the route taken over each continent. 
4] The Readers on Commerce and Industry take up the 
three great essentials of human existence, food, clothing, and 
shelter. The children visit the great food centers and see 
for themselves how the chief food staples are produced and 
prepared for use, they travel over the globe investigating the 
sources of their clothing, and they learn how the different races 
are housed, and of what their dwellings are composed. The 
journeys are along geographical lines.

Story of the Romans 
   LTHOUGH these popular books are intended primarily 
for supplementary reading, they will be found quite as 
valuable in adding life and interest to the formal study 
of history. Beginning with the fifth school year, they can be 
used with profit in any of the upper grammar grades. 
| In these volumes the history of some of the world’s peoples 
has taken the form of stories in which the principal events are 
centered about the lives of great men of all times. ‘Through- 
out the attempt has been made to give in simple, forceful lan- 
guage an authentic account of famous deeds, and to present a 
stirring and lifelike picture of life and customs. Strictly mili- 
tary and political history have never been emphasized. 
| No pains has been spared to interest boys and girls, to 
impart useful information, and to provide valuable lessons of 
patriotism, truthfulness, courage, patience, honesty, and in- 
dustry, which will make them good men and women. Many 
incidents and anecdotes, not included in larger works, are 
interspersed among the stories, because they are so frequently 
used in art and literature that familiarity with them is in- 
dispensable. The illustrations are unusually good. 
4| The author’s Myths of Greece and Rome, Myths of 
Northern Lands, and Legends of the Middle Ages, each, 
price $1.50, present a fascinating account of those wonderful 
legends and tales of mythology which should be known to 
everyone. Seventh and eighth year pupils will delight in them.

TEXT-BOOKS ON GEOLOGY 
By JAMES D. DANA, LL.D., late Professor of Geology 
and Mineralogy, Yale University 
Geological Story Briefly Tod . . . . 2. ee Revised Text-Book of Geology. Fifth Edition (Rice) . 
Manual of Geology. Fourth Edition. . . . . . 
HE present edition of the GEOLOGICAL STORY 
was the last considerable work of the eminent author’s 
long life. As geology is emphatically an outdoor 
science, the student is urged to study the quarries, bluffs, and 
ledges of rock in his vicinity, and all places that illustrate 
geological operations, The prefatory suggestions are full of 
practical help, besides enumerating the tools and specimens 
desirable for this study. 
4] The REVISED TEXT-BOOK OF GEOLOGY is here 
brought down to the present time as regards its facts, but it 
still expresses the views of its distinguished author, While 
the general plan and the distinctive features have been pre- 
served as far as possible, a few important changes have been 
made relating mainly to zodlogical and botanical classifications, 
to the bearings of geology and paleontology upon the theory 
of evolution, and to metamorphism, ‘The order of the grand 
divisions of the science, physiographic, structural, dynamical 
and historical, remains the same as in previous editions, 
4| The present edition of the MANUAL OF GEOLOGY 
was wholly rewritten under the author’s direction. Owing 
to the extensive recent investigations, new principles, new 
theories, new facts relating to all departments of the science, 
and widely diverging opinions on various questions have all 
made their contributions to this book. The later tracing of 
formations and mountain-making, the increased number of 
fossils, the study of cafions and other results of erosion, and 
the development of petrology are all prominently treated here.

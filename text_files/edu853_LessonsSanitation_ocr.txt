  PREFACE 
Tuese “ Lessons on Sanitation” have been used by me with 
splendid success during the last seven years, and many of my 
successful students who now hold public appointments owe 
their success to them. 
Since I first wrote them, more than seven years ago, they 
have been constantly altered, and additions made to keep 
them up to the latest knowledge and practice in sanitation. 
I have found by experience that this method of teaching 
is the best, as a knowledge of any subject is learnt in an 
interesting manner, and, at the same time, as the student is 
learning the subject he is also learning how to put that 
knowledge down in writing, or to express his knowledge, 
The lessons consist of four hundred questions and answers 
arranged in fifteen lessons, The first fourteen lessons consist 
of twenty-four questions and answers each, and the fifteenth 
lesson of sixty-four questions and answers for the viva-voce, 
or second day’s examination, most of which have been asked 
of my students. The lessons are illustrated by fifty-three 
illustrations, and preceded by a List of Abbreviations used at 
the examination, and in practice. At the conclusion I have 
given, in an Appendix, a list of the places and societies holding 
examinations in sanitation, with names and addresses of the 
secretaries. po /

1 Q.—What are the characteristics of a good drinking-water ? 
A.—A good drinking-water should be clear, sparkling, and 
well aerated. It should contain no suspended matter which 
can be detected by the eye. It should be colourless, palat- 
able, and have no particular odour. . . 
2 Q,—What are the proper sources for drinking-water for towns 
and villages? Give also suspicious and dangerous sources. 
A.—(a) According to the Rivers Pollution Commissioners, the 
following are the sources from which wholesome water is to 
be obtained : 
(1) Spring water 
(2) Deep well water Wholesome. 
(3) Upland surface water 
(6) They also give the following : 
Stored rain water 
Surface water from cultivated lands 
River water to which sewage gains access 
Shallow well water } Suspicions. 
Dangerous, 
.—Is it a reliable test of the purity of a water to find that 
it is clear and sparkling ? 
-—No; as water may be clear and sparkling and still be 
dangerously polluted by organic matter in solution. 
.—Is animal or vegetable organic matter the most dangerous 
sontaminating substance ? 
-—Animal matter is the most dangerous.

5 Q.—What do we mean by hard and soft water? Which i: 
the better for domestic purposes, and why ? 
A,—(a) Soft water is water with which it is easy to obtai. 
lather with soap. It contains little or no solid matter 
solution. When water contains a large quantity of lime _ 
solution, and will not readily form a lather with soap, it i 
said to be hard, If the lime or other salts be present t 
above twelve degrees the water is said to be hard, below si 
degrees, soft; and a degree of hardness means one grain o 
lime or other salts per gallon of water. The '

the latter is caused by the sulphates of lin

(6) Soft water is much to be preferred for domestic pur- 
poses, as by its use soap is saved and vegetables are betiter 
boiled in it; it also makes better tea. Hard water cause 
the substances boiled in it to be covered with a coating ¢ 
bicarbonate of lime, &c., as also the vessel in which it é 
boiled. 
  6 Q.—What kind of wells are there? What are thi 
of the waters yielded by them ? 
A,—(a) Wells may be divided into three classes, v 
(1) Surface wells. 
(2) Deep wells, 
(8) Artesian wells. 
(8) Surface wells are confined to the soil whi 
the ground or subsoil water. They may become 
organic matter soaking through the soil int: 
although the water may be freed from suspended 
filtering through the soil, and appear clear to *: 
dissolved impurities still remain. Pollution may 
through the rising of the ground water, by whic 
a cesspool or other source of contamination. & 
do not usually exceed 20 or 30 feet deep. “ 
are those which are sunk through an impervi: 
into a deeper water-bearing one. The water m: 
and not well aerated, but is generally free fi 
matter. Deep wells may be from 100 to 300 
Artesian wells, so called from their occurrence 
province in France, are those in which the wate: 
‘its own level rises up the well, and may even {I 
the mouth. The name is often applied to or:
-P-A-G-E-14
WATER-SUPPLY 3 
wells, and the water is similar but frequently warmer, as 
these wells are sometimes over 2000 feet deep. 
7 Q.—How should a deep well be constructed in order to prevent 
contamination by subsoil drainage? What kind of cement should be used ? 
A.—(a) The sides or walls of the well should be constructed 
of good, hard-burnt bricks, built in cement down to the 
water level, or to the impervious stratum. Also a layer of 
puddled clay should be placed all round the outside, nine 
inches thick, between the brickwork and the soil. The top 
should be covered with stone slabs set in cement, and raised 
above the surrounding ground, by a stone curb to prevent 
surface pollution. The surface of the ground should, if 
possible, slope away from the well. It should be provided 
with a pump. 
(2) The best Portland cement should be used. 
8 Q.—What is the average annual rainfall in Great Britain ? 
Also state how shany gallons of water daily are necessary for 
all purposes ? 
A.—(qa) The average annual rainfall in Great Britain is thirty 
inches, varying from twenty inches on the east coast to as 
much as seventy or more on the west coast of Scotland and 
Ireland. 
(2) This varies with the habits of the people, their manu- 
factures, &e., but Dr. Parkes gives twelve gallons per head 
for purely domestic purposes, and excluding a water-closet 
supply; to this should be added five or six gallons per day 
(per head) for water-closets, where they are in general use, 
five gallons per head for manufacturing purposes, and five 
ditto for municipal purposes, such: as street watering, sewer 
flushing, &c. Glasgow allows fifty gallons per head and 
Sheffield only twenty ; it cannot therefore be stated definitely, 
but twenty-five gallons per head per day is an average allow- 
ance for all purposes, 
Q.—What are the dangers of storing water in house cisterns, 
and how may they be obviated ? 
A,—(a) The cistern is often placed in some inaccessible part 
of the house, where it becomes dirty from want of cleansing, 
also uncovered and unventilated, so that dust and dead

bodies of insects, vermin, as mice, beetles, dc., may gain acce: 
Also the w.c. is often supplied direct from this cistern, 
that foul gases may thus gain access to the water. Or t 
overflow pipe from the cistern may be connected direct 
the soil-pipe or drain, 
(6) To obviate these dangers the cis

storage cistern, termed a water-waste-preventer, 
only flush two or three gallons per time. The overi 
should be taken through the external wall and b

10 Q.—Why should one cistern not suffice for both the wate 
supply for drinking purposes and that: required for th, 
closet? Also state why the overflow of the cistern: | 
not communicate with the drain. 
A.—(a) For two reasons. First, because the water woul 
become polluted by the foul air from the w.c. ascending th 
flush pipes ; second, a great waste of water is caused whe 
* _.. the w.c. is flushed unless a water-waste-preventing cistern | 
fixed for w.c. 
(6) The overflow from the cistern should not communicat 
with the drain for the same reason as the flush pipe—viz 
the water would absorb the foul air or gases, 
11 Q.—Which is the better system of water-supply, th 
“constant” or the “intermittent” ? 
A.—The constant, as houses are supplied direct ! | 
mains, and the stdrage cistern, with its attendant ' 
from pollution, want of cleansing, é&c., is not necessar ) 
for the hot water-supply. In the intermittent sj 
addition to the dangers attendant upon the use of : 
cistern, when the water is turned off,a vacuum i. Wu 
in the pipes, and any defect in the pipes allows filth fra 
any leaking drain or gas from gas mains, &c., to get into zh 
pipes.
-P-A-G-E-16

12 Q.—Of what materials are the “‘ main” and “ house service ” 
pipes for conveying water usually made? 
A.—The main pipes are made of east iron with a coating of 
some protective material to prevent rusting, as Dr, Angus 
Smith’s solution or varnish. House service pipes are usually 
made of lead. 
13 Q.—Is it more dangerous to convey “soft” water through 
Jead service pipes than “hard” water? Name any materials 
suggested as a protective coating for pipes. 
A.—(a) Yes, as the soft water dissolves the lead, while hard 
water deposits a protective coating or deposit on the inside 
of the pipes. 
(6) Dr. Angus Smith’s varnish ; iron pipes coated with a 
particular oxide by the action of saperheated steam for several 
hours in a chamber (termed the Bower-Barff process) ; lead 
pipes lined with tin; glass-lined iron pipes and galvanised 
iron pipes. 
14 Q.—What are the characteristics of rain-water? Would 
you consider water containing 2, of a grain of lead per 
gallon as unfit for drinking purposes ? 
A.—(a) The characteristics of rain-wWater are: . 
(1) Freedom from hardness, as, being a naturally distilled 
water, it cannot contain any appreciable quantity of 
lime or other salts. . . 
(2) Thorough aeration. In its passage through the air it 
dissolves. a certhin amount of nitrogen and oxygen, 
and a small quantity of carbonic acid gag, 
(3) Liability to take up any impurities from the air through 
.which it passes, as sulphuric acid gas, &. It is also 
' often found to contain dust, soot, vegetable matter, 
excreta of birds, &c., which it washes down. 
(6) Yea, ‘decidedly unfit and poisonous; probably gy of a 
grain should be regarded as poisonous to most people. 
15 Q.—Give the composition of an ordinary filter-bed. 
4,—Filter-beds are composed partly of sand, which ought to 
be sharp, angular, and not too fine; and partly of gravel of 
varying degrees of coarseness. - The outlet pipes are at the 
bottom and upon them is placed a layer of small stones, then 
gravel of decreasing coarseness, and on the top sand, which . 
should be from 13 to 2 feet deep. Each square foot of
-P-A-G-E-17
6 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
such a filter will allow seventy to seventy-five gallons to 
pass through it in twenty-four hours. 
16 Q.—Enumerate the essential points of a good filter for 
domestic use. 
A—(1) A perfect filter must not contain any material which 
can impart injurious qualities to the water which passes 
through it. 
(2) It must remove the organic impurities held in solution , 
as well as the mechanically suspended matter. 
(8) It must be so constructed that the user can take it to 
pieces himself, and thoroughly clean it with very little 
trouble and at very little cost. 
17 Q.—-How may the water of streams and rivers become 
polluted 2 In what way can such waters be purified ? 
A,—(a) The sources of pollution of rivers and streams are : 
(1) Mineral impurities, such as carbonates and sulphates 
of lime and magnesia, from the bed of the stream and 
rocks over or through which the water has flowed. 
(2) Sewage matter and general refuse of houses, villages 
and towns. 
(8) Acids, alkalies, and manufacturer’s waste from fac- 
tories. 
(8) By boiling such polluted water most of the mineral 
impurities are deposited, and the sewage matter is rendered 
harmless ; but the suspended matter is not eliminated, while 
the acids and alkalies may not be affected. By afterwards 
filtering the water through*gravel, sand and animal char- 
coal, it is re-oxygenated and the suspended matters are 
removed, 
18 Q.—Calculate the capacity in gallons of a rectangular tank 
215 feet by 215 feet and 12 feet deep. Also the pressure 
in lbs. per square foot on the bottom, and the total interna] 
pressure upon one side of the tank. 
A.—(a) The cubic capacity of the tank is 215 x 215x 12 —. 
554,700 cubic feet.. One cubic foot =6°25 gallons. Ther 
554,700 x 6:25 = 3,466,875 gallons in tank. 
(2) As the pressure upon the bottom is directly propox-— 
tional to the head of the water, which in this case is 12 
feet, the pressure upon one square foot on the bottom wily 
be equal to the weight of a column of water whose base
-P-A-G-E-18
WATER-SUPPLY 7 
is one square foot and height 12 feet; one square foot 
multiplied by 12 fost (head) x 62.5 (the weight of one cubic 
foot of water) = 750 Ibs. : 
(c) The internal pressure upon one side will be equal to 
the weight of a column of the liquid whose base equals the 
area pressed and whose height equals the depth of the centre 
of gravity of the area pressed below the surface of the liquid. 
The area of one side = 215 x 12 = 2580 square feet. The side 
of the tank is a rectangle and its centre of gravity will there- 
fore be at its geometrical centre, viz., 6 feet below the 
surface of the water, and as one cubic foot of water weighs 
62:5 Ibs., then the total internal pressure on one side of the 
tank equals, 2580 x 6 x 62°5 = 967,500 lbs, 
19 Q.--Does the ground water level of different districts vary, 
and has it any direct bearing upon the health of any given 
locality ? 
A,—(a) Yes. It varies according to the depth of the imper- 
vious stratum below, on which this water rests. 
(6) Yes. It has been proved that in districts where the 
‘ground or subsoil water is high, it makes the locality damp, 
and dampness is one of the conditions which favour consump- 
tion and chest diseases generally, as also malarial fever. It 
. also fosters and causes the spread of diphtheria, 
20 Q.—Find the theoretical quantity of rain water obtain- 
able from a single house roof 40 feet long and 18 feet 
wide during six months, taking the average rainfall and 
assuming that one inch of rain per square foot equals half a 
gallon. 
A.—40 x 18 =720 square feet; and 720 x * x $= 54.00 gallons, 
21 Q—How many inches must the water be lowered in a 
square tank with 12-feet sides to fill a 6-inch drain 20 feet 
long 2 
A,—tThe capacity of a 6-inch drain 20 feet long = ‘5? x 7854 x 
20 = 3°927 cubic feet. The area of the tank is 12’ x 12’ = 144 
. square feet, and to obtain in it a capacity equivalent to that 
of the drain would require a vertical depth of el = "0272 
feet =-3264 of an inch (that is less than one-third of an inch in depth).  
-P-A-G-E-19

22 Q.—-How may water be polluted within a dwelling ? 
A.—By using filters constructed of improper material 
neglect in cleaning them often and thoroughly. F 
dirty vessels, or leaving them exposed to dust, fli: 
gases, dc. Also in the intermittent system a storage vioucs a-, 
becomes a necessity with its attendant dangers, as given im 
answer No. 9, also by the pipes absorbing foul gases, &c. , 
when the water is turned off (as given in answer No. 11)- 
In both systems if the water is soft it may dissolve lead froma 
the pipes, &e. (as given in answer No. 13). 
23 Q.—What steps would you take if a well in a village was 
reported to be polluted ? 
A,—I should proceed as soon as possible to the spot, provided. 
with a new clean “ Winchester quart ” (half a gallon) bottle 
having a glass stopper and a leather cover for same. Also 
some string and sealing-wax and a seal to secure the stopper 
after taking the sample. I should rinse out the bottle two 
or three times in the water before taking the sample, arid 
take care not to take the top water as it may be covered 
with dust or scum. After taking the sample I should make 
notes of the date, position of the well, reason or reasons for 
taking the sample, depth or approximate depth of well, dis- 
tance from any possible source of pollution, as cesspool, privy, 
manure heap, drain, &c. I should examine the well and 
note whether it was lined or steined with stone or brickwork 
and if provided with a pump of what material it was made ; 
ascertain, if possible, if the water is known to have caused 
any illness, as if so this is the best evidence in an opposed 
case. After sealing I should take (if not too far) or send the 
same and particulars as quickly as possible to the public 
analyst, and on receiving the result of his analysis I should 
report to the sanitary authority, who may pass,a resolution 
that proceedings be taken against the owner to close or 
amend the well, 
24 Q.—Describe and sketch the Pasteur-Chamberland Filter. 
A.—(a) The filtering medium is a specially prepared, fine~ 
grained, unglazed porcelain cylinder, which is open at the 
lower end only, where it is provided with a glazed porcelain, 
nozzle. The cylinder is enclosed in a case through the bottom, 
end of which the nozzle passes, and communicating with the
-P-A-G-E-20
WATER-SUPPLY 9 
top end there is a pipe with a screw socket for fastening the 
filter to a water tap. The water enters the outer case and 
filters through the cylinder into its internal cavity and 
escapes through the nozzle at its lower end.

VENTILATION AND CUBIC SPACE, ETC. 
1 Q.—Give roughly the composition of the atmosphere, and 
briefly state the properties of the chief gases present. 
A—(a) The composition of the atmosphere varies in different 
situations. In the following table the proportions of the 
various ingredients of an average sample are given: 
Oxygen, 209°6 per 1000 volumes, 
Nitrogen (including Argon, &c.), 790-0 per 1000 volumes, 
Carbon-dioxide, 0°3 per 1000 volumes. 
Watery vapour, varies with temperature. 
Ammonia, a trace. 
Organic matter, variable. 
Ozone, variable, 
Salts of Sodium, variable. 
Other mineral impurities, variable. 
(2) Oxygen is the all important element. It is the gas to 
which the air owes its purifying power, and it is the great 
supporter of combustion. If the proportion present were

parts of towns. 
2 Q.—What makes an over-crowded room unhealthy ? 
A.—In addition to carbon-dioxide, a large quantity of 
matter (the result of tissue waste), and also impure 
vapour are given off from the lungs and skin, and
-P-A-G-E-22

these that injury must be, in a large measure, attributed. 
Carbon-dioxide may be ‘present in considerable quantity 
without any ill effects being apparent, as is provéd in the 
case of workers in aerated water manufactories. It bas been 
proved that the ratio of carbon-dioxide added to the air as 
the result of respiration, corresponds very closely with the 
amount of organic matter from the same source, and for this 
reason it is taken asa standard of purity. It is the presence 
of effete organic matter from our bodies that causes the dis- 
agreeable odour and sensation of stuffiness experienced in 
occupied rooms that are not ventilated. 
3 Q.—What is the relative importance of the changes produced 
in air by respiration? And how many cubic feet of air per 
gor should an adult have ? 
A.—(a) The changes produced in air by respiration are : 
(1) The quantity of oxygen is diminished. 
- (2) The quantity of carbon-dioxide is increased. 
3) The quantity of watery vapour is increased. 
4) The expired air contains a certain quantity of foul 
organic matter from the lungs. 
(5) The air is heated. \ 
Of these five changes the most important are the first and 
fourth. It is the diminution of oxygen and the presence of 
organic matter in the air which makes it unfit to breathe

4 Q.—What cubic space per head is usually allowed in schools, 
common lodging-houses, cottages, and barracks? and is the 
allowance sufficient ? 
A,—(a) In schools 80 or 100 cubic feet ; in common lodging- 
houses 300 cubic feet; in cottages there is no legal limit, 
but the same amount is usually taken as allowed in common 
lodging-houses ; in barracks 600 cubic feet, 
(6) No, it is not sufficient.

5 Q—Can a larger space be substituted for a continued supply 
of fresh air 2 
A.—No ; as: even with a space of 10,000 cubic feet occupied 
by only one person, in the absence of ventilation the limit of 
impurity would be reached in a little over three hours, after 
which time the same amount of fresh air would have to be

introduced as in the case of smaller rooms, in order not t 
exceed the standard of impurity. 
6 Q.—What impurities in air are caused by various manufac} 
ems processes ? 
A.—(a) Hydrochloric acid gas fiom alkali works. 
(2) Sulphurous and sulphuric acids, from copper work: 
and from manufactories where bleaching is carried on. 
(c) Sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonia, from mos 
chemical works and gasworks. 
(d) Carbon-dioxide, carbon-monoxide, and 
hydrogen, from brick-kilas and cement works. 
(e) Carbon-monoxide is given off in large quantities from: 
the furnaces of smelting iron and copper works. 
(f) Organic matter from glue-makers, bone-burners 
slaughter-houses, &e. 
(g) Oxide of zinc from brass trades. 
(A) Arsenic fumes, from copper-smelting works. 
({t) Carbon bisulphide, from india-rubber works. 
Besides the above, almost all manufacturing processes consu ma¢ 
—and very imperfectly—large quantities of coal, &c., anc 
give off immense quantities of carbon in the form of soot 
from the chimneys, and thus pollute the air. 
7 Q.—What are the natural forces of ventilation, anc| 
incoming air greater in winter than in summer ? 
A,—(a) The chief forces acting in nature which 
ventilation ave: 
(1) Diffusion ; 
(2) The action of the winds; 
(3) The movement produced by unequal weights of 
upon which principle the wind itself is dependent ,

8 Q.—What is the best position in a room for inlet and outlet 
ventilators? How largean inlet-opening is required for each 
person, and why? And should the areas of inlet and outlet 
ventilators be the same, and why ? 
A,-—(a) The inlets should be placed in situations as far as 
possible removed from the outlets, so as to ensure as complete 
a circulation of air as possible. If they are placed close 
together the air will enter and pass out without mixing with 
that of the room, and so the object for which they are 
intended, namely, the dilution of the impure atmosphere, 
will not be accomplished. The warm air being lighter than 
cold has a tendency to rise, therefore the most suitable 
position for outlets is in or near the ceiling; for the same 
reason, namely, that cold air is heavier than warm, the inlets 
should be placed above people’s heads so that the cold air is 
warmed in falling, and thus draughts are avoided. About 
6 feet above the floor is a suitable height.. 
(6) The inlet opening for each individual should not be 
less than 24 square inches. If the air moves at the rate of 
5 feet per second, such an inlet would supply 3000 cubic feet 
of air per hour. As 3000 cubic feet per hour is required 
per head this would be right. 
(c) Theoretically, the size of the outlet should be Jarger 
than that of the inlet, because warm air has a greater volume 
than cold air, but the difference is so slight that it may be 
disregarded and both openings made the same size. : 
9 Q.—Does friction in an inlet tube greatly affect the velocity 
and volume of the air entering ? : 
Enumerate the chief causes of friction. 
A.—({a) Yes. 
(6) The chief causes of friction are bends, angles, rough- 
ness of surface, and length of tubes. 
10 Q.—Describe McKinnell’s, Hinckes Bird’s, and Boyle’s (Mica- 
flap) ventilators, State the particular advantages of each ? 
A.—McKinnell’s ventilator is a combined inlet and outlet 
ventilator which is only suitable for upper rooms or one- 
storey buildings. It consists of two tubes—the one encircling 
the’other. The area of both is the same, but the inner one, 
which acts as the outlet, is continued for some distance 
above the other, and is fitted with a cowl or cover to keep 
out the rain, &c. The lower end of the inner tube is 
prolonged a little distance into the room, and has a flanged 
Sa

rim some inches in width which extends beyond 
covered by the outer tube, and thus prevents the 
air from descending at once into the room, and ce. 
spread out to the sides for some distance parall 
ceiling. 
Hinckes Bird’s ventilator consists of a piece of 
plate glass two or three inches deep or wide and t 
‘of the window sash. It is fixed under the lower s:

But a better plan (and less unsightly) is to make t! 
inside beading on the sash frame about three in 
the lower sash to be lifted nearly that height, wher: 
object is attained. 
‘Boyle’s Mica-flap ventilator is an outlet vent, designed to . 
be fixed in the chimney flue or a special flue made on 
purpose close to the ceiling of the room. Back draught is 
prevented by means of valves, which are thin tale plates sus- 
pended on cross-bars behind the grating, these move backwards 
when the draught is from the room, and close tight to the 
frame when any down draught occurs from the chimney. 
The noise made by the tale valves can be remedied by having 
the valves made of silk, which is often done in the | 
designs. In time the valves become clogged with soo 
fixed in smoke flues; this is why they are better f 
separate air flues.

12 Q.—How may a room be lighted with gas so as to assist in 
the general ventilation of the apartment? and how many 
cubic feet of air will an ordinary gas burner consume per 
hour ? 
A.—(a) What are known as sun-burners are fixed near the 
ceiling and connected with an outlet shaft. The heat 
generated by the gas is thus taken advantage of as an 
extracting power, and all noxious fumes, the result of 
combustion, are at once carried away, together with a large 
amount of foul air from the room. 
(8) An ordinary gas burner will consume from three to 
five cubic feet of gas per hour, and will therefore require a 
supply of from 5000 to 9000 cubic feet of air per hour, or as 
much as two or three adults. 
13 Q.—Why isa properly constructed open fireplace preferable 
to a stove for warming and ventilating 4 room? Explain 
what is meant by the terms “ Radiation ” and “ Convection.” 
A.—(a) The fireplace (when a fire is lit) and the chimney 
combine to act as a powerful extractor of air from the room, 
so that the air in the room is being continually changed, while 
in the case of warming by a stove no such action takes place, 
or only to a limited degree, and when the stove door is 
open; a stove also dries up the air in a room, as also do 
hot-water pipes. . 
(8) Radiation is the propagation of heat from a hot body in 
all directions with equal intensity, the effect lessening accord~ 
ing to the square of the distance ; thus, if the heat at one foot 
distance ‘from a fire be taken as 1, then at 10 feet it will be 
100 times less. . Convection is that mode in which the heat 
is propagated by moving masses of air, which is dependent 
upon the characteristic of allowing the portion which has been 
heated to expand and rise, and colder air to take its place 
setting up a sort of circulation until the whole mass is 
warmed. The open fireplace is an example of radiation ; 
stoves and hot water pipes are examples of convection. 
14 Q.—Define overcrowding. Calculate the cubic capacity of a 
room, 11 feet high, by 40 feet long, by 30 wide, and having 
a semi-circular bow window 20 feet wide. 
A.—(a) Theoretically, overcrowding is when there is not 
1000 eubie feet of air space per adult person, but, legally, 
when there is less than 300 cubic feet (as allowed for 
common lodging-houses) the room is badly overcrowded.

DRAINAGE, SANITARY APPLIANCES, ETC. 
1 Q.—What is the difference between a “drain” and a 
“sewer”? and, are authorities agreed that a trap should be 
placed between a house drain and a sewer ? 
A.—(a) By section 4 of the Public Health Act, 1875, a _ 
“Drain” meansany drain of and used for the drainage of one, 
building only, and made merely for the purpose of com- 
municating therefrom with a cesspool or other like receptacle 
for drainage, or with a sewer into which the drainage of two © 
or more buildings or premises occupied by different persons 
is conveyed. “Sewer” includes sewers and drains of every 
description except drains to which the word “drain” in- 
terpreted as aforesaid applies, and except drains vested in or 
under the control of any authority having the managemeut 
of roads and not being a local authority under this Act. 
(6) No. As some sanitary engineers now advocate the 
direct. connection with sewers (without the intervention of 
a disconnecting or intercepting trap) of all house drains, 
in which case the soil-pipes and ventilating shafts assist 
in the ventilation of the sewers, but it is only where the 
sewers are constructed on the most approved principles that 
such a plan should even be thought of ; it would be a dan- 
gerous proceeding in the case of old and badly constructed 
sewers. 
2 Q—Of what materials should house drains and sewers be 
made? State how they should be laid. Give the minimum 
fall for house drains. 
A,—(a) Glazed socketed stoneware pipes are alone admissible 
for drains and sewers up to eighteen inches diameter. 
(2) They should be laid as far as possible in straight lines, 
with the socket end directed towards the upper end of the
-P-A-G-E-33
22 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
drain or sewer. They should rest on a solid foundation and 
on the body of the pipes, not on the sockets. 
(c) The fall should be such as to ensure a self-cleansing 
velocity in the sewage, that is, not less than 1 in 40 for a 
4-inch pipe and 1 in 60 for a 6-inch pipe when flowing 
ml or half full, The fall should be uniform throughout the 
ain. 
3 Q.—Name a very common fault made in the size of drains, and 
state what you consider to be an average size for house drains. 
A.—(a) Drains are very often needlessly large, and thus the 
flush is much reduced. For example; given two drains of 
equal fall, each carrying the same volume of sewage, one 4 
inches and the other 6 inches in diameter, the rate of travel, 
and therefore the flushing-power will be greater in the small 
drain because the depth of liquid is greater thar it is in the 
larger drain. 
(6) As a rule 4 inches is large enough except in the case of 
large houses or hotels. 
4 Q.—How should the joints of drain-pipes be made, and under 
what circumstances is a bedding of concrete necessary ? 
A,—(a) Joints should be made with the greatest care, the 
best Portland cement being alone admissible. Having care- 
fully cemented the joint, not only at the top but all round, 
the workman, before making the next joint, should rake out 
the pipe with a specially constructed wooden implement to 
make sure that no cement is left inside the pipe, otherwise it 
will set and form an obstruction. A good plan is to lay a 
bedding of cement on the lower half ofthe pipe before insert- 
ing the spigot end of the next pipe, then, after pressing 
inwards and downwards the next pipe, we are sure of a good 
bedding in the lower half of the joint; also if the inverts of 
the two pipes are not quite level or straight the drop will be 
downwards in the direction of the flow of the sewage, The 
joint should then be made with cement, as before mentioned, 
and the cement inside the socket should meet that outside, 
thus forming a thoroughly watertight joint, 
(6) Unless the ground is naturally solid all drains should 
be laid on a bed of concrete at least 4 inches thick, and 
if through, or under, a building or near a well, &., the 
drain should be embedded all round in 6 inches of concrete, 
put, unless there is no other way, drains should not be laid 
under buildings or near wells. .

5 Q.—What are the essential conditions to be observed in 
forming junctions and bends in drains ? A.—Junctions must always be in the form of a V ; no branch 
drain should join at right angles, nor in the cOiitrary direc- 
tion to the flow of the sewage; if they do so join the main — 
drain, splashing will occur, and this in time leads to obstruc- 
tion. Bends should as far as possible be avoided, and when 
unavoidable should be as easy as possible. 
6 Q.—Specify the main points requiring attention in traps used 
in house drainage. 
A.—They must be self-cleansing (except gullies) and this 
means that there shall be no angles, cavities or projections 
inside them, They must impose a sufficient and constant 
barrier, or seal, against the passage of sewer gas through 
them ; this necessitates a depth of water seal of at least 14 
inches. Means of access should be provided to all traps as 
they are a source of obstruction todrains. Also where lable 
to syphonage an air-pipe on the sewer side of trap must 
be provided.” Tiie air-pipe (or anti-syphonage pipe) should also 
be fixed where there is any danger of sewer gas foreing the 
seal, but this should not occur if the drains and sewers are 
properly ventilated,

(b) Fig. 11 is defective because the dip is not sufficient t: 
form a proper water seal; the bottom of the trap is rounde: 
underneath, consequently there is a risk of its being fixe: 
out of level; there is no provision for the ventilation of th: 
drain, and also there is no means of access to the trap c 
drain beyond in case of obstruction. Fig. 12 is open to th 
same objections as Fig. 11, except as to the access in case © 
obstruction ; there is the additional objection that floatin; 
matters are likely to accumulate in the central opening « 
shaft. Fig. 13 is a good form of interceptor, suitable for 
manhole or disconnecting chamber, and Fig. 14 is a. simile 
trap for use where no chamber is provided. 
8 Q—Why are the “ Bell,” “ Dipstone,” “ Antill’s” and “ D 
considered objectionable forms of trap 2 
A.—In the Bell trap the seal is insufficient ; it is likely to g: 
choked by the settlement of mud, dust, &c. The cover and 
bell being loose are often lifted off when the drain or waste 
pipe is left untrapped. The Dipstone or Mason’s trap is 
little better than a cesspool. It is not self-cleansing, solids 
collect at each end, and it is seldom water-tight or air-tight. 
Antill’s trap, although an improvement on the Bell trap, is 
not satisfactory, as it is soon obstructed by deposit. In the 
D trap there are too many sharp angles, also in time the dip 
pipe becomes corroded away to above the water-line; thus 
the trap is-rendered useless and sewer gas can pass freely 
through it.

but it is only necessary for large hotels, mansions, &c. The 
anti-D trap, Fig. 17, is a modification of the 8 or P trap, 
the outlet of the trap is made square in section to guard 
against syphonage, and the part of the trap forming the seal 
is less in diameter than either the inlet or outlet of the trap.

to 24 inches diameter should have a fall or gradient 
sufficient to produce a velocity of not less than 2 feet per 
second., A less gradient is required for large sewers than 
for sm4ll ones, but the volume of the sewage must be very 
much greater. The velocity of sewage in house drains should 
not be less than 8 feet per second, 
11 Q.—Explain why manholes are introduced into a sewerage 
system, and state how they should be constructed. 
A.—(a) Manholes are introduced in drainage and sewerage 
systems, for the purpose of access and inspection of the 
drains and sewers. ‘bey should be built at all important 
junctions and bends, and not more than 100 yards apart in
-P-A-G-E-37

straight lengths of sewers. When manholes ai 
stopped drains and sewers can generally be cleare 
of drain rods, thus saving expense in openil 
ground and taking up the drain or sewer. 
(6) They should be built of hard, well-burnt bricks i 
cement mortar, and the drain or sewer should be continued| 
across the floor in open half-channel pipes laid on a bed of 
concrete, and the sides of the channel carried up several 
inches higher than the top of the drain or sewer, s 
prevent overflowing ; the sides should also have a goo: 
inwards towards the channel. They should be covere 
cast-iron air-tight covers, and be ventilated.

because as the water ascends between the outer and inner 
pipes, the air, or some of it, is driven through the water in 
the lower chamber, and, when the water has risen to the top 
of the central pipe, it begins to fall down into the lower 
chamber carrying a certain quantity of air with it, and in 
time a sufficient vacuum is established within the pipe, to 
cause the pressure of the atmosphere to force the water from 
the tank into it, and thus syphonic action being started, the 
tank is rapidly emptied through the outlet at the lower end 
into the drain. The top rim of the central pipe is curved 
inwards so that the water falls freely down the centre instead 
of trickling down the sides. These tanks are used at the 
head of drains and sewers, where a sufficient fall cannot be 
obtained to render them self-cleansing. For large sewers 
they are generally built of brickwork. They are also used 
for flushing ranges of trough closets, &c. 
13 Q.—Which is the best system of sewage removal, the “‘ Water- 
Carriage” or the “Conservancy System ?” 
A,.—Great difference of opinion has hitherto prevailed as to 
which ought to have the preference, but the water carriage 
system is now generally admitted to be the best, except in 
the case of scattered populations dependent for their water- 
supply upon local wells. 
14 Q.—What are the main points requiring attention to prevent 
sewage and accumulations of house refuse becoming a 
nuisance? Explain the term “ putrefaction.” 
A,—(a) The great principle to keep in mind is the thorough 
and immediate removal of all fluid refuse from the vicinity 
of dwellings, and the storage of all solid refuse in such a 
manner, and for such short periods, as not to cause a 
nuisance. 
(6) Putrefaction is the result of an attack upon dead 
organic matter by minute living germs, or bacteria, ever 
present in the air.

16 Q.—Name the conditions necessary to be observed in the con- 
struction of a cesspool, also privies with movable recep- 
tacles, 
A,—(a) They must be absolutely water-tight. This may be 
accomplished by building them with hard, well-burnt bricks 
in cement mortar, and placing round the sides and under 
it a layer of puddled clay 6 or 9 inches thick, Also ren- 
dering the inside with good cement mortar. The cesspool 
should be from 50 to 100 feet from a dwelling-house, and 
as far as possible from any well or other source of water- 
supply. It should be situated on the lowest place in the 
locality, so that the surface and subsoil water will flow 
towards it. An arched roof should be built with three 
openings, one for a ventilating shaft, one for a pump, and a 
larger one for gaining access to the cesspool for the purpose 
of cleansing, repairs, &c. This should be provided with an 
air-tight manhole cover. .

or, a door can be made in the back or side wall of the. pri 
to remove it. The privy should be lighted, and ventilated 
near the roof, the floor should be paved with flags, or tiles, 
&ec., and should be 6 inches above the yard level with a fall 
or slope towards the door. The space under the seat should 
also be paved with non-absorbent material, and be 3 inch 
above the level of the ground. The walls should be con

structed of good bard bricks 9 inches thick, with flagged 
lroof. The receptacle itself is limited to two cubic 
acity by the Model By-Laws. 
‘hat points should attention be given in the construo- . 
aw.c.? State for what class of building a trough 
closet is most suitable. 
A.—(ay Tt should be placed close to an outside wall, and if 
possible separated from the rest of the house by a passage 
cross ventilated ; the closet itself should be provided with a 
window two square feet in area and capable of being 
opened. The w.c. basin should be either a properly con- 
structed valve closet, or (where this is too expensive) a pedestal 
wash-down with a good large area of water to receive the soil 
and prevent fouling of the sides. It should be supplied with 
a three-gallon flush of water from a small water-waste- 
preventing cistern, and the soil-pipe should be outside the « 
house, and be carried upwards full size above the roof, if 
possible without bends, to a height of two feet above all 
windows and chimneys, unless a long distance away from 
them. 
(8) The trough closet is-suitable for factories, schools, and 
some public buildings. 
18 Q.—Deseribe briefly the main features of the following 
water-closets, viz.:—‘‘ Valve,” “ Plug,” “Long and Short 
Hoppers,” “ Wash-out,” and “Wash-down.” Also give a 
sketch of a wash-down w.c. 
A,—(a) The valve closet consists of an enamelled earthenware 
basin which is kept about two-thirds full of water by a valve 
at the outlet. By means of a “ pull” this valve is depressed © 
within a box under the basin, and thus the water and soil 
are discharged into the trap below. ‘The valve box is made 
of cast-iron, enamelled inside. A lead safe should be fixed 
under all valve closets to prevent Jeakage from the basin 
going through the ceiling into the room below, when the 
closet is out of order. The plug closet is also termed the 
trapless closet. The water seal is maintained by a plug 
which is fixed in a chamber on one side. It is not safe to 
connect this closet without a proper trap, of S or P shape, 
as foul air can gain access when the plug is lifted, if it is so 
connected; also, a match or other small substance getting 
between the plug and its socket prevents it from shutting
-P-A-G-E-41
30 
19 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
properly, and thus allows the water forming the seal to escape 
and the foul air to pass directly into the house. Long and 
short hoppers are composed of two pieces, the basin and trap 
being separate. The long hopper is a bad shape, as, owing 
to its length it is seldom, if ever, properly flushed and the 
surface becomes very foul; this should not be allowed. The 
short hopper is a great improvement, and is a suitable w.c. 
for outside water-closets. The wash-out and wash-down are 
somewhat similar to the short hopper, only they are in one 
piece of earthenware, both trap and basin ; that is, they are 
what are termed pedestal water-closets. ‘The wash-out is a 
bad form of w.c., as it is hardly ever flushed out properly 
with the first flush of water. The basin is so formed as to 
hold a certain quantity of water which is held back from 
escaping into the trap bya weir. It is the lifting outof this 
water, soil, &c., that breaks or destroys the main force of the 
flush and the soil, &c., drops into the trap below and simply 
forces out the excreta, d&c., left there by the person using it 
before and remaining in the trap for the next flush to force 
it out. 
The wash-down has the advantages of the wash-out 
without its disadvantages, that is, it has a water receiving 
area to prevent fouling of the sides, and it is all in one piece, 
but the flush acts directly upon the water in the trap and 
basin, and a three-gallon flush never fails completely to 
change the contents of the trap and basin.

  Fig. 22. 
2.—Name the principal methods of sewage disposal, and 
briefly outline the same. : 
A.—Sewage should first be screened to rid it of straw, sticks, 
rags, &e. It should then be allowed to stand for a certain 
length of time quietly in tanks to allow the solids to settle 
to the bottom. This is termed “ precipitation,” and is gener- 
ally assisted by the addition of lime, alum, salts of iron, or 
other substances, either singly or in combination ; the solids 
settle to the bottom in the form of sludge, and the liquid 
above is left comparatively clear. The sludge is pumped up, 
after draining it, to a pit and pressed into moulds for sale to 
farmers for manure. In some cases the top liquid is run off 
direct into a river or stream, in others it is further treated 
by one of the following methods :—Land filtration, broad 
irrigation, or artificial filtration. The best method cannot 
be stated lightly, as it depends upon the character of the 
sewage. In land filtration, or intermittent downward 
filtration, as it is sometimes called, the sewage is flowed over 
the land at intervals of ' so many hours, with rest between, 
effiuent drains are laid 5 or 6 feet below the surface to 
collect the effluent after filtration through the soil; the 
land is often cultivated. In broad iryigation the process is 
very similar to land irrigation, with the difference that 
greater attention is paid to the cultivation of the Jand, and 
the land used is very much greater. The effluent drains 
are usually about 3 or 4 feet deep; the quantity of land 
required is about one acre for every hundred of the popula- 
tion. Artificial filtration used to consist of sand and 
gravel filters in combination with charcoal or polarite, &.,
-P-A-G-E-43
32 
21 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
but less expensive materials are now used. Sand and gravel 
act at first as mechanical strainers, but later they are made 
to act chemically by the bacteria which develop in the in- 
terstices. Open bacteria beds are used from 3 to 6 feet 
in depth, the sewage first entering the coarser beds and 
then finer beds, which consist of coke breeze, burnt ballast. 
&c, This method is termed the Sutton or Dibdin system, and 
also the aerobic system, because in this system both light 
and air are admitted to the beds freely. In the anaerobic 
system, or septic tank method, both light and air are kept 
from the bacteria. This is accomplished either by open or 
by closed beds, or tanks; in the open tanks the inlet and 
outlet are submerged below the level of the surface, and a 
scum is allowed to accumulate on the surface to keep out the 
air and light. 
Q.—Given three drains of 3 inches, 4 inches, and 5 inches 
diameter converging to a common point, what diameter must 
the pipe be to carry off the delivery of these three when 
flowing full? 
A.—This can be answered in two ways, viz., by calculation 
or graphically, To do it by calculation, square the diameters 
of all the three drains and add the results together; by ex- 
tracting the square rvot, the diameter of the fourth pipe 
equal in sectional area to all the others appears, as follows : 
8x3=9, 4x4=16, 5x5=25, and 9+16+25=50; the 
square root of 50 is 7°08 inches approximately, or say 7 inches ; 
but as this size of drain is not general, an 8-inch or 9-inch 
drain would be used. By graphic methods, draw two lines 
at right angles to each other, one 3 inches and the other 
4 inches long; then draw the diagonal line completing the 
triangle, measure this line to the same scale with which the 
other two have been drawn, and it will be found to be 5 
inches in length. This equals the diameter of a pipe which 
will be the same area as the 3 and 4 inches combined, 
Now, if this process is repeated by again drawing two lines 
at right angles, the length of one line to be the diameter of 
the pipe which has just been found to be equal in area to the 
other two, namely 5 inches, and the length of the other 
equal to the diameter of the third drain given, namely 5 
inches, and a diagonal line again drawn and measured, it 
will give the diameter of the pipe which is equal in area to 
all the three pipes given, and it will be found to be slightly 
over 7 inches long (sce Figs. 23 and 24).

it is generally found connected to a D or helmet trap, The 
basin is fixed on the top of a large cast iron vessel, called 
a container or receiver. A movable copper pun holds the 
water in the basin; this pan is pivoted on one side, and 
when the pull of the closet is raised the pan describes a 
quarter circle, and its contents are suddenly dashed to the 
bottom of the container, and some of the fecal matter

splashes on the bottom and sides of the latter, and on the 
underside of the pan, giving off foul smells into the house 
every time the pull is raised. It will be seen at once what 
a filthy and insanitary w.c. this is, and if no trap is fixed 
under it foul smells from the drain can enter the house when 
the pan is depressed. . 
24 Q.—State the number of gallons it would take to fill a 6-inch 
drain 20 feet long, giving calculations. 
A,—First find the cubic contents of the drain in feet and 
multiply by 6-25, the quantity of gallons (approximately) 
contained in one cubic foot. The area of 6-inch drain 
='5 x5 x °7854 = "19635 of a square foot. 
Multiply this by length of the drain in feet thus: 
‘19635 x 20 = 3°927 cubic feet in drain. Now multiply this 
by 6:25 =24-54375 gallons required to fill the drain, or 
24} gallons approximately.

objections to seamed lead for this purpose. State how. soil- 
pipes should be ventilated. What diameter of pipe is 
necessary ? 
A.—(a) Drawn lead and cast iron of water-main strength 
coated inside with Dr. Angus Smith’s solution or glass lined. 
(6) Seamed lead is always liable to open along the seam or 
joint, by expansion and contraction. 
(c) Soil-pipes should be ventilated by being carried up full 
size higher than the roof of the building, they should be as 
free from bends as possible, and be so placed that the foul 
air is not discharged near or into open windows or chimneys ; 
where the roof overhangs the wall run the soil-pipe straight 
through without bends,

(c) First insert the spigot end of the upper pipe into the 
socket end of the lower pipe, and ram a few rings of spun 
yarn down to the bottom of the socket to prevent the molten

(6) This practice is not a good one, because foul smells 
from the drain can ascend the pipe and find their way into the 
house through open windows and doors, as the joints in the 
rainwater pipes are not made air-tight. Also the foul air 
can escape out of the top end of the pipe and under the 
eaves or slates of the roof, and thus into attics, de. 
4 Q.—To what points would you specially direct your attention 
in inspecting the sanitary condition of a dwelling-house 2 
A,.—Outside the house I should note the position of the soil- 
pipes, ventilation shafts, waste-pipes from baths, sinks, 
wash-basins, cistern-overflows, &c.; see if the drain is dis- 
connected from the sewer by an intercepting trap, with a 
fresh-air inlet. See if any cesspools, privies, middens, & , 
are near the house, and note whether the roof looks good or 
defective, or the walls damp. Inside the house I should 
examine the cellar floors and walls for signs of dampness. 
Gullies or drains under the floor can often be detected by 
dampness or a settlement of the tiling or flagging; see that 
cellars are ventilated. On the floors above, note position, 
trapping, flushing and ventilation of w.c.s, baths, sinks,
-P-A-G-E-48
. SANITARY BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 37 
wash-basins, &. I should see that the w.c.s are cut off from 
storage cistern by small water-waste-preventing cisterns, 
and that the overflows are cut off short after going through 
the external wall. I should see that all rooms without 
fireplaces are adequately ventilated, and the rooms not 
over-crowded; see that all windows open, and that the 
water-supply is satisfactory. Lastly, I should see that the 
spouting and guttering are in good condition, and if there 
is a damp-proof course. 
5 Q.—Describe how waste-pipes from baths, sinks, &c., should 
be dealt with. Is there any objection to their contents being 
discharged into the soil-pipes ? 
A.—Waste pipes from baths, sinks, wash-basins, &e., should 
be of lead, say 14 inches in diameter. They should be trapped 
immediately under the sink, &c., with a lead 8 or P trap the 
same diameter as the waste-pipe. The trap should have an 
access eye soldered at its lowest point to clear it if it is ever 
obstructed. The top end of the pipe should be opened out 
trumpet or funnel-shaped so that a larger grate, perforated, 
can be fixed in the outlet of the sink, thereby more effectually 
flushing the pipe. After leaving the trap the pipe should be 
taken immediately through an external wall (and all sanitary 
fittings should be fixed close to external walls) and be cut 
short off over a glazed stoneware channel, leading to a proper 
trapped gully 18 inches distant, or, in. the case of a large 
hotel or mansion, to a grease trap. 
(6) They should not be allowed to discharge into the soil- 
‘pipe or into any drain until disconnected in the way 
described above, as if the back pressure is very strong 
there is not sufficient depth of water in the S or P trap to 
resist it, also the traps may become unsealed through neglect _ 
and other causes. An exception is made in the case of the 
waste-pipe from a slop sink, which is treated just the same 
as a pedestal w.c., only the waste-pipe need only be from 2 
inches to 24 inches diameter. 
6 Q.—Which of the following soils would you consider healthy 
for building sites: gravel, sandy, peat, clay or chalk ? 
A,—A gravelly or sandy soil is perhaps the best if of consider- 
able depth and on a slight slope. Sand is also a warm site. 
Clay is damp and unhealthy unless thoroughly drained, and 
it is cold unless covered over with a layer of good Portland 
cement concrete. Chalk is dry and healthy if it is of good
-P-A-G-E-49
38 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
depth. Peat land and all soils which contain much vegetable 
or animal matter are unhealthy. 
7 Q.—Describe the various methods of testing drains. 
A.—Drains when open in the trenches should be tested by the 
water or hydraulic test; when covered or filled in, by the 
smoke test, which also acts as a test for the vent shafts and 
soil-pipes. ‘To test by water the lower end of the drain must 
be stopped by means of a plug or bag and the drain filled with 
water to above the highest joint. Some puta vertical pipe 
at upper end to put more pressure, or head as it is called, 
but this is not necessary, as if the drain is stopped it over- 
flows from the gulleys, &c. Some authorities also say that all 
gulleys, &c., should be unsealed to prevent air-lock in the 
branches, between the water in the gulleys and the rising 
water in the drain ; in my opinion this is unnecessary, for, if 
the airlock occurs the branch is air-tight, which is quite as 
good as being water-tight. ‘[o apply the smoke test properly 
one of the smoke machines is necessary. Smoke is blown in 
by it at the lower end of the drain (or at any unsealed gully 
or trap) as soon as smoke is seen to issue from the top ends 
of the soil-pipes and vent-shafts, they are stopped up and 
search is begun for any leakages either inside or outside the 
house. 
Some authorities use smoke rockets, but they are not so 
good as a machine as the amount of smoke is limited, whereas 
with a machine smoke can be blown into the drain as long as 
you wish. 
Sometimes old drains can be tested with water, either 
with or without the addition of colouring substances, by 
simply pouring it down the drain and looking where it is 
thought the leakage occurs; this is sometimes useful where 
a drain passes along a passage and the leakage occurs into a 
cellar. There is also the oil of peppermint test, which consists 
of mixing a few ounces of it with a bucket of water, say in 
the w,c. inside the house, pouring it down the w.c. and 
immediately covering the pan over with a damp rag and 
keeping door and window tightly shut to keep in the smell. 
-This is not a good method, as it is very difficult to prevent 
the smell from escaping into the rest of the house. Of course 
the person pouring down the peppermint must not come out 
of the room until all is complete otherwise the smell would 
come with him. A much better test than the last isto insert 
a Banner’s hand-grenade over the trap of w.c., or gulley, by
-P-A-G-E-50
SANITARY BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 389 
means of a ‘round wooden ball called a “ drain explorer,” to 
which a string is attached, for the double purpose of breaking 
the glass tube holding the chemicals (which is termed the 
grenade) and also to draw back the ball when the test is 
complete. 
8 Q—State how you would test bricks and slates for building 
construction. Oo 
A.—The bricks should be hard, well burnt, and not mis- 
shapen; they should be uniform in size, with flat surfaces, 
out .of winding, and have sharp arises and square angles 
They should give out a clear ringing sound when knocked 
one against the other, and not absorb more than one-sixth 
their own weight of water. Slates also should give out a 
clear ringing sound when knocked with the knuckles: they 
should be non-absorbent, flat, and out of winding, without 
iron pyrites and streaky markings; they should not be 
earthy or soft, but hard. 
9 Q.—What is the object of footings and concrete under 
walls? Also what is a damp-proof course, of what materials 
is it composed, and what position should it occupy in a 
wall? . 
A.-(a) Footings are the bottom courses of bricks or stones. 
They are spread out wider than the thickness of the wall on 
both sides to distribute the weight over a larger area and 
thus prevent the wall sinking ; concrete is sometimes spread 
under walls for the same purpose. . 
(0) A damp-proof course is a course or layer of imperish- 
able and non-absorbent material inserted in a wall to prevent 
damp rising from the ground up the wall. Various materials 
are used for this purpose, such as a course of glazed stone- 
ware slabs, lead, asphalt, pitch and tar sanded over, a double 
course of slates laid in Portland cement mortar, &. In 
buildings without cellars the proper position is 6 inches 
above.the ground, but below the floor timbers. In buildings 
with cellars, or with the ground floor below the ground level, 
two damp-proof courses shouid be inserted, one below the 
cellar floor and the other just above the ground level; the 
wall between the two should be a cavity or hollow wall, or 
else a vertical damp-proof course should be put from one 
horizontal damp-proof course to the other inside the thick- 
ness of the walls.
-P-A-G-E-51
40 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
10 Q.—-Specify the chief causes of damp walls, and give different 
methods of preventing or remedying the same. 
4.—(a) The chief causes of damp walls are as follows : no 
damp-proof course, walls too thin, or built of pervious 
materials, defective roofs and gutters. 
(6) Remedies are to fix a damp-proof course or courses, 
excavate soil and build dry area round house, repair roof 
and gutters when defective; where walls are too thio or 
pervious, or in very exposed situations, they should be slated, 
tiled, weather-boarded, cemented or tarred. It is a good 
plan to construct new buildings with hollow walls, and a 
damp-proof course should be fixed at the top between the 
ceiling joists and roof timbers. 
11 Q.—Nawme the best material for cellar floors. 
A.—Cellar and basement floors are best formed with 6 inches 
of good Portland cement concrete rammed solid. The top 
surface may be floated to a smooth surface with cement and 
sand, or wood blocks may be laid on concrete in a mixture of 
pitch and tar or composition. ‘This makes the floor warmer ; 
it is clean, noiseless, and does not harbour vermin. 
12 Q.—State why some wall-papers are dangerous to health. 
A.—Because some coloured wall-papers contain arsenic and 
there is no simple method of testing them. They should be 
obtained from reliable firms with a guarantee, and if any 
doubt exists a sample should be analysed. 
13 Q.—How should water-pipes be protected against frost ? A.—Outside the house they should be 2 feet 6 inches below 
the ground, and inside they should not be fixed against 
external walls if it can be avoided. When unavoidable they 
should be fixed on a board at least 1 inch thick, and in cold 
or draughty places they should be wrapped with felt or 
cocoa-nut fibre, or a box formed around them and filled with 
sawdust. 
14 Q.—What additional pipe should be fixed when two or more 
water-closets are connected to the same soil-pipe? What is 
it called, what size should it be, and what position skould it 
be placed in? How do you deal with its upper end? 
A.—When two or more w.c.s are fixed on the same soil-pipe a 
pipe should be connected to the traps on the drain or sewer 
side. It is called an anti-syphonage or airpipe, and the
-P-A-G-E-52
SANITARY BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 41 
object is to prevent the lower w.c. traps being syphoned 
when the upper w.c.s are flushed. It need not be more than 
24 inches diameter and should not be less than 2 inches, It 
should be fixed to the top of the trap on its outlet side, and 
can either be carried up, like the soil-pipe, higher than the 
roof, or be connected to the soil-pipe above the topmost water- 
closet. It should receive a branch pipe from each water- 
closet trap in its upward course. 
15 Q.—How should soil-pipes be attached to the wall ? 
A.—Lead soil-pipes are usually attached to walls by means of 
“tacks ;” these are pieces of lead soldered to the pipe and 
nailed to the wall with flat-headed nails. Iron pipes when 
of rainwater strength are made with ears or lugs cast on 
with nail-holes to allow of pipes being nailed to the wall, but 
when of water-main strength patent fastenings of different 
forms are used. Iron pipes should be fixed several inches 
from the wall so that the back can be painted. 
16 Q.—What is ground air, and how can its access to houses be 
prevented ? 
A.—Ground air is the air which is intermixed with the soil 
from its surface down to the level of the ground water or 
subsoil water. When the ground or subsoil water rises the 
ground air is discharged into the atmosphere, but it can be 
prevented from rising into houses if the whole site is covered 
with a layer of Portland cement concrete or asphalt, of 
sufficient thickness and rammed solid.

(5) Where one of the various patent joints, such as 
Doulton’s metallo-keramic joint is not used, the proper way 
is to make a wiped soldered joint between the lead branch 
and a brass or gun-metal thimble, or socket-piece ; a Portland 
cement joint can be made between the thimble-piece and the 
w.c, outgo.

(6) This joint, like the last, is best made with the help of 
a brass or gun-metal thimble-piece, only it should have no 
socket. The bottom end of the lead soil-pipe is opened out 
to receive the end of the thimble, and a wiped joint is made 
here; the lower end cf the thimble has a flange, which in 
this case should be about 8 inches in diameter ; this rests in 
the socket end of the 6-inch bend of the drain, a Portland 
cement joint should be made here. A thimble with a flange 
about 6 inches in diameter should be used when the bend is 
4 inches diameter, or what is called a taper, or diminishing 
bend.

Q.—How can the access of sewer air to houses be prevented ? 
A.—By disconnecting the house drain from the ‘sewer by 
means of a properly ventilated intercepting trap. Also, in 
addition, all waste-pipes from sinks, baths and lavatories 
should be properly trapped and disconnected over open chan- 
nels 18 inches distant from trapped gullies, All drains 
should be kept outside the house, the drain and soil-pipe 
should be properly ventilated by carrying the shafts higher

(5) Close boarding should be used when the ground is very 
loose ; in quicksand, grass or litter is also used by forcing 
it in the joints or behind the boards. Drain pipes with 
patent joints should be used so that no cement is required. 
The Stanford, Doulton, or Hassell patent joists are suitable 
for this class of work.

22 Q.—Mention the respective advantages and disadvantages 
of cast-iron and stoneware drain pipes for house drainage 
purposes. In what lengths are these pipes usually made? 
Of what material and in what manner are the joints of each 
respectively made ? 
A,—(a) The advantages of cast-iron drain pipes over stone- 
ware are many and the disadvantayes few. 
(1) Iron pipes are made in 6-feetlengths ‘and even longer, 
while stoneware pipes are usually in 2-feet lengths, 
hence drains made with the former have correspond- 
ingly fewer joints. As the joints are the weakest 
parts this is a great advantage. \_ 
(2) Cast-iron pipes are not crushed by pressure from 
above, like stone-ware pipes are. 
(3) The joints are not broken by careless filling in (or 
ramming) the ground over them, as stoneware pipes 
often are. 
(4) Drains made with properly jointed cast-iron pipes do 
not readily leak ; whereas stoneware pipes with cement 
joints may soon becomé defective and leaky owing to 
the shrinkage of the cement, .or to the collars (or 
sockets) being broken off by its ‘expansion. The ad- 
vantages of stoneware pipes over cast-iron‘are, first, 
they are cheaper to buy, and cheaper ,to lay, as a 
labourer can and does, lay and joint them, whereas a 
plumber is required to properly lay cast-iron pipes; 
and interceptors, gullies, &c., are cheaper ; and cutting 
the pipes to the length required is cheaper and 
quicker. Second, there is no liability to. rust as in 
cast-iron pipes (unless the latter are treated inside and 
out to prevent this, a proceeding which adds to the 
cost). 
(8) As stated above, the stoneware pipes are usually in 
2-feet lengths, although they are also madein 3-feet lengths. 
Cast-iron pipes are made in lengths of 6 feet and 9 feet. 
(c) The joints of the stoneware pipes are usually made by 
first inserting the spigot end of one pipe into the socket of 
the other, then ramming in all round a few strands of spun 
yarn steeped in cement grout, and, lastly, finishing the joint 
off at an angle of 45 degrees, with neat Portland cement, 
or Portland cement and sand in equal portions. The joints 
of casi-iron pipes are made by running into the joint molten 
lead, and caulking them tight with « special bent caulking 
tool.

more females than males. If the seats are made to lift up, 
automatically or otherwise, in the men’s w.c.s, they can be 
used as urinals also; if they are not so made, separate urinal 
accommodation must be provided. The wes are built out 
as an annexe to the main building (storey above storey); 
the soil-pipes should be outside and carried higher than the 
roofs. 1f more than one storey high, an anti-syphonage 
pipe should also be carried up, and all the w.c.s connected to 
it. ‘he passage or lobby between the room and the w.c.s 
should be provided with louvred ventilator openings, for 
cross, or through, ventilation. It should be plainly set forth 
on the door from the room which are for males, and which 
for females. : 
Pedestal wash-down w.c. basins must be provided, with 
straight backs ‘a water-waste-preventing cistern should be 
connected thereto’ with a 1}-inch flush pipe, at least 4 
feet 6 inches above the basin. A notice should be fixed in 
each w.c. requesting persons to flush the same after using.

(8) All the drains should be taken up and two new drains 
Jaid from the street sewer, along the side of each house. An
-P-A-G-E-58

intercepting trap should be fixed in a manhole or inspection 
chamber immediately inside the front garden wall. The 
drain should then be continued straight to the rear corner of 
the house, and a second inspection chamber built there ; the 
gullies on this side would have to be connected to this length 
of drain, but the soil-pipe should be taken separately into 
the first manhole, The drain is then continued from the 
second manhole along the rear of each house until it passes 
the furthest gully, when it should be directed to the rear 
wall of the house and finish at a 4-inch ventilating pipe ; as 
the soil-pipe is not near the head of the drain an additional 
vent shaft is required. The drain could be 6 inches in diameter 
from the sewer to the first manhole, and beyond that it need 
only be 4 inches throughout.

LESSON V 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES, DISINFECTANTS, ETC. 
1 Q.--What is meant by the “period of incubation,” and the 
“period of invasion ” in the case of an infectious disease ? 
A.—(a) The period of incubation is the time which elapses 
between the introduction of the contagion into the body and 
the disease manifesting itself. 
(6) The period of invasion is the time between the period 
of incubation and the time when symptoms peculiar to the 
disease in question become manifest. This period ends in 
the convalescence or death of the patient. 
2 Q-—The period of greatest danger varies in different diseases. 
Explain this in the case of measles, whooping-cough, typhus, 
and enteric or typhoid fevers. 
-A.—The period of greatest danger from the point of view of 
infection in measles and whooping-cough, corresponds with 
the early stage of the disease ; whereas in typhus and enteric 
fevers, it corresponds with the acute stage. 
3 Q.—What are the advantages of isolation and quarantine? 
A.—The patient or person infected is kept from mixing with 
others, and persons known to have been in the company of 
“the person affected are kept away from others until the 
period of incubation time has passed, when it can be seen 
whether they have become infected or not. By isolation of 
the person affected and the placing in quarantine of any 
suspected of being affected, the Local Authority can prevent 
the spread of infectious diseases to a great extent. 
4 Q.—When is there most danger of infection spreading in the 
case of smallpox? In visiting a house where there was a 
case of smallpox what particulars would you ascertain 2 
A,—Smallpox is highly contagious from the first, but it is
-P-A-G-E-60
. > 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES, DISINFECTANTS, ETC. 49 
considered more dangerous in the later stages and during 
convalesence. 
(8) If the case has not been notified by a medical man. to 
the Medical Officer of Health, it will be necessary to take 
name of patient, nature of disease (small-pox in this case), 
name of medical attendant (if any), situation and kind of 
house, viz., whether a through or back-to-back house. Names 
of owner and tenant of house, number of rooms, lodgers (if 
any), number of family, schools they attend, and where they 
work, nature of water-supply, drainage, and sanitary condi- 
tion of the house generally. 
5 Q.—-What are the chief causes of the spread of scarlet fever ? 
A,—Children being allowed to run and play about, or attend 
school when actually in the peeling stage, the disease not 
being notified to the Medical Officer of Health, and the room, 
clothing, bedding, &c., not being disinfected. The milk- 
supply, when infected, may cause an epidemic. 
6 Q.—Specify the main points requiring attention to prevent the 
spread of diphtheria. 
A.—The first and most important point is isolation of the 
patient, as in all other infectious diseases; other points are 
the thorough disinfection of the bedding, clothing, and room 
used by the patient, paying special attention to the discharges ~ 
from the throat and nostrils by using clean rags, and then 
burning them immediately. The milk-supply should be 
investigated, as milk has been known to spread this disease ; 
the sanitary condition of the premises should be inquired 
into; and all animals liable to infection, such as the cat, 
removed and isolated. 
7 Q.—How is the prevalence of measles and whooping-cough — 
" chiefly accounted for ? “ 
A,—Neglect, improper treatment, and insanitary conditions. 
No attempt is made at isolation in the majority of cases, as 
the disease is often so slight as to be regarded as a cold, and 
the child is allowed to play with other children as usual, thus 
causing the spread of the disease. 
8 Q. Howis the infection given off in the case of enteric (typhoid) 
fever? and what preventive measures should be taken ? 
A.—(a) The infection is chiefly, if not entirely, given off by 
the discharges from the bowels of persons affected. 
D
-P-A-G-E-61
50 
9 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
(6) The patient should be removed to hospital, or otherwise 
isolated; and the bedding, clothing, and room disinfected. 
All soiled bedding and clothing of little value should be 
burnt. Special attention should be given to the bowel dis- 
charges, all of which should be received into a vessel containing 
some liquid disinfectant (as a 1 in 1000 solution of corrosive 
sublimate), and be well mixed therewith. This should be 
buried away from houses and water-supply when in the 
country, and in towns when properly disinfected, it can be 
put down the drain, which should be well flushed afterwards. 
‘Where pail closets are in use, a special pail should be used, 
which should have its contents burnt in a destructor (if 
possible), or buried (as before mentioned). 
Q—In what respect does cholera resemble enteric fever ? 
A.—Cholera resembles enteric fever in the manner in which 
the infection is chiefly given off. This is by the discharges 
from the bowels. 
10 Q.—What are the usual conditions favouring the disease 
known as typhus fever? and how is the poisonous matter 
given off in this disease ? 
A,.—(a) The usual conditions favouring this disease are filth, 
overcrowding, want of ventilation ; all or any of which are 
aggravated by a low state of living. 
(6) Although no pathogenic microbe is yet known, there 
appears to be no doubt that there is one, and that it is given 
off by the breath of the patient, and possibly by exhalations 
of the skin and the excreta. 
11 Q.—Is tuberculosis (generally called consumption) an infec- 
tious disease, and name the chief causes of this disease. 
A.—(a) Yes. 
(8) The chief cause of this disease is the tubercle bacillus 
or germ, but there are many conditions which favour the 
growth of this germ in certain people. There is first of all 
an undoubted hereditary predisposition to the disease—that 
is a special weakness of the body to resist the germ is handed 
down from parents to children. Many trades favour the 
growth of this disease, also overcrowding and want of venti- 
lation. It is most prevalent in damp houses and localities, 
and it is possible that the eating of meat and drinking of the 
milk from infected animals may also cause the disease. 
Another name for this disease is phthisis. .
-P-A-G-E-62
INFECTIOUS DISEASES, DISINFECTANTS, ETC. .51 
12 Q.—How is the infection chiefly given off in the case of the 
following diseases; small-pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, 
measles, and whooping-cough ? 
A.—In small-pox, by the breath and by the scabs when 
separating and drying. In scarlet fever, by the breath, the 
discharges from the throat, and especially by the peeling of 
the skin in the later stages of the disease. In diphtheria, by 
the discharges from the throat and nostrils. In measles, by 
the breath, and, in whooping-cough, by the breath and the 
discharges from the throat. 
13 Q.—Briefly outline the advantages of the compulsory notifica- 
tion of infectious diseases. . 
A —The advantage is that early notification is thus given to 
the Medical Officer of Health, so that immediate steps can be . 
taken by him and the sanitary staff’ to check the spread, by, 
if possible, removing the patient to the hospital, and, if not, 
by seeing that isolation of the patient is carried out ; and, if 
necessary, the placing in quarantine of those known to have 
been in contact with the patient ; and the disinfection of the 
room, clothing, bedding, é&c. 
14 Q.—Are authorities agreed that all infectious diseases are due 
to the introduction into the human system of living germs or 
their spores ? 
A.—Yes; although in some diseases it cannot be definitely 
stated how the infection is given off. 
  15 Q.—Give a list of the diseases enumerated as compulsorily 
notifiable in the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889. 
| Also state what diseases should, in your opinion, be added. 
| A,—(a) These are set forth in section 6 of the Act and are as 
follows: Small-pox, cholera, diphtheria, membraneous croup, 
{ erysipelas, and the fevers known as scarlet, typhus, enteric, 
» relapsing, continued and puerperal. 
f (6) In my opinion the following should be added: Measles, 
| whooping-cough, influenza, and tuberculosis. 
16 Q.—State briefly the duties of an Inspector of Nuisances with 
regard to cases of infectious disease. 
A.—In large towns the district inspectors will receive a list 
containing names and addresses of cases of infectious disease, 
when they should visit the houses as soon as possible and 
endeavour to induce the patient to be removed to the fever 
hospital, and also influence the friends of the person affected

-P-A-G-E-64
  INFECTIOUS DISEASES, DISINFECTANTS, ETC. 53° 
A.—(a) Yes; because the penetrating power of moist heat 
is much greater than that of dry heat, : 
(6) Washington Lyon's apparatus consists of an oval 
chamber with double walls, with a door at each end opening 
into different rooms; the infected goods are. put into the 
apparatus at one door and taken out at the other. The 
rooms should be entirely separate, with no. communication 
except a fixed window. Steam is discharged into the appa- 
ratus by two pipes, one communicating with the cavity 
formed between the walls-of the apparatus, and the other 
with the interior of the chamber; pressure-gauges are pro- 
vided to indicate the pressure in each case. The makers 
recommend 30 Ibs. per square inch in the cavity or jacket 
and 20 ibs. in the interior, The articles are placed in a wire 
é cage or suspended from the rack provided for this purpose, 
= and are then pushed into the chamber on rails. The articles 
can be left in to dry after being disinfected. ~ 
%19 Q.—How should a room be disinfected with sulphur? And 
what quantity is required to disinfect a room of 1000 cubic 
feat 2 a 
A.—(a) This’is done by setting fire to sulphur broken small 
and placed in-an iron vessel, or vessels, according to -the size 
of the room, after pasting up all chinks around the windows, 
&¢., and stopping up the fireplace and ventilators, éc. Add 
a little methylated spirit to facilitate lighting, and after 
lighting, leave the room quickly and paste brown paper all 
around-the door. To prevent fire the vessel should be placed 
on two bricks standing in a tray of water, the sulphurous 
acid gas is more effective in the presence of moisture. - 
(b). Authorities differ; some say 1 1b. of sulphur to every 
1000 cubic feet. of space, while others say at least 3 lbs. per 
ditto; but most are agreed that this process has little germi- 
cidal power. 
4-20 Q.—How is chlorine gas obtained for fumigation purposes; 
and what time is required for the disinfection of a room with 
’ this gas? : 
A.—Chlorine .gas-is given off when chloride of lime is moist- 
ened with a little dilate sulphuric, or strong hydrochloric, 
acid, “'The most convenient method for fumigation purposes 
is to add. 14.to-2 pints of the acid to 1 Ib. of the lime for 
each 1000 cubic feet of space. A shallow vessel should be

should have all ready, and the door open so as to leave the 
room quickly when he has poured on the acid. Stop all 
openings as for sulphur fumigation. The room ought to 
remain closed for twelve hours. 
Q.—What powers have local authorities to disinfect rooms? 
A,—Section 120 of the Public Health Act, 1875, gives power 
to local authorities to serve notice, upon, either owner or 
occupier, requiring him to cleanse and disinfect, upon the 
certificate of a Medical Officer of Health or other medical 
practitioner, that the cleansing and disinfecting of any house 
or part thereof, and of any articles therein, would tend to 
prevent infectious diseases. A penalty is incurred by 
default, and the Sanitary Authority may do what is necessary 
and recover the costs, or may undertake this duty in the first 
instance, with the consent of the occupier, at their own cost. 
_In districts where the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 
1890, is adopted, the above section is repealed, and upon the 
certificate of a medical practitioner the sanitary authorities 
may, after twenty-four hours’ notice to the owner or occupier, 
proceed to carry out such disinfection or cleansing, unless 
within that time he informs the Sanitary Authority that he 
will within a period fixed in the notice himself do it to the 
satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. If he fails to do 
this, the officers of the Sanitary Authority may do it. under 
the superintendence of the Medical Officer of Health, and the 
expenses may be recovered. Power of entry between the 
hours of 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. is given for this purpose. 
Q.—In what way would you proceed to disinfect clothing 
after a case of infectious disease ? so . 
A.—All the clothing should be sent to be disinfected by 
means of a proper disinfecting apparatus where one is. pro- 
vided. The same van should not be used for carrying away 
infected clothing, bedding, &c., and for bringing back the 
same when disinfected. Wheré there is no proper apparatus, 
all articles of little or no value should be burnt, and all_ other 
clothing except blankets, flannels, &., should be boiled for at 
least 10 minutes. Blankets, flannels, carpets, &c., should be 
soaked in a solution of corrosive sublimate of a strength of 
1 in 1000, and then well washed in cold water, and hung 
outside exposed to the sun as long as possible (for some hours 
at least).

INFECTIOUS DISEASES, DISINFECTANTS, ETC. 55 
23 Q.—May an infectious disease be caused, or conveyed, through 
the milk-supply ? if so, how ? 
A,—Milk may be affected by diseased conditions of the cow, or 
animal yielding it. Milk from cows suffering from foot- 
and-mouth disease should not be consumed as food; it may 
cause disease in human beings. Tuberculosis in cows is said 
to affect the milk yielded by them, especially when the teats 
are affected, and may lead to the same disease (consumption) 
in man. There is reason to believe that scarlet fever, 
diphtheria, enteric fever, and also cholera are in many cases 
either caused or conveyed by. the milk becoming infected 
either direct from the animal, by the use of polluted wat 
or by persons handling it when suffering from the diseagy! 
24 Q.—What powers ake vested in local authorities with resp 
to the prevention of infectious and epidemic diseases ? 
A,—If adopted, the Infectious Diseases Notification Act of 
1889 gives power to compel the notification of infectious 
diseases. Also, if adopted, the Infectious Diseases Preven- 
tion Act 1890 provides for inspection after 24 hours’ notice, 
see answer No. 21 in this lesson. The Public Health Act 
1875 is not an adoptive Act, and applies to all sanitary” 
authorities in England and Wales (except London), Section 
120 gives power to cleanse or disinfect rooms or to compel 
owner or occupier to do so, see answer No. 21 in this 
lesson.’ Section 120 gives power to sanitary authorities to 
destroy infected bedding or clothing, &c., and gives compen- 
sation. Section 122 gives sanitary authorities power to 
provide a disinfecting apparatus and disinfect free of charge. 
Section 123 gives power to sanitary authorities to provide an 
ambulance and pay expenses of conveyance of infectious 
persons to hospital. Section 124 provides that where a 
hospital is provided within a convenient distance, a justice 
may, on the certificate of a medical practitioner, order the 
removal of any person who is suffering from any dangérous | 
infectious disorder, and is without proper lodging or accom- 
modation ; or is lodged in a room occupied by more than one 
family; or is on board any ship or vessel. Section 125 pro- 
vides that the sanitary authorities may make regulations for 
removing to any available hospital, and for keeping there as 
long as necessary, any person brought within their district 
by vessel who is infected with a dangerous infectious disorder, 
Section 126 makes it unlawful for any person suffering from 
any dangerous infectious disorder to expose himself wilfully,

without proper precautions against spreading the disorder, 
in any street, public place, shop, inn, or public conveyance, - 
or to enter any public conveyance without previously notify- 
ing the owner, conductor, or driver thereof that he is so 
suffering; or, being in charge of such sufferer, to expose such 
sufferer, or to give, lend, sell, transmit or expose without 
previous disinfection any bedding, clothing, rags, or other 
things which have been exposed to infection from any such 
disorder. Section 127 provides for penalty on failing to 
disinfect public conveyances so used. Section 128 provides 
for penalty against letting houses or rooms where infected 
persons have lodged, without being properly disinfected to 
the satisfaction of a medical practitioner, as testified by 
certificates signed by him. Section 129 provides for penalty 
for letting such houses on false statements. Section 142 
provides for the removal of a body of one who has died of 
infectious disease and is retained in a room in which persons 
live or sleep, or which is in such a state as to endanger the 
health of the inmates of the house or room in which it is 
retained ; in either of which cases a justice may, on a certifi- 
cate signed by a medical practitioner, order it to be removed 
to a mortuary, or direct the same to be buried within a 
specified time, '

FOOD INSPECTION, DISEASES OF ANIMALS, ETC. 
1 Q.—Deseribe the successive steps you would take in inspecting, 
seizing, and obtaining the condemnation of diseased, unsound, 
or unwholesome meat, 
A,—The Medical Officer of Health or Inspector of Nuisances 
may, at all reasonable times, Sundays included, inspect and 
examine any meat exposed for sale, or deposited in any place 
presumably for the purposes of sale as, or preparation for, 
human food, and if it appears to him to be diseased, unsound, 
or unwholesome, he may seize it and carry it away, or cause it 
be carried away to be condemned by a magistrate, and.after 
(not before) the justice has condemned it, he may destroy 
it. If obstruction be offered to his examination or seizure he 
must apply to the justice for a summons; this is equivalent 
to a right of entry though such right is not expressly given. 
If he has reason to suspect that unsound food is kept or 
‘concealed on any premises, he may obtain from a justice a 
warrant to enter such premises, search for, and carry away, 
any unsound food, to be condemned by the justice, Obstruc- 
tion in this case is penal but there is no penalty beyond the 
destruction of the unsound food if it was not offered for 
sale, 
2 Q.—Give the Act and section under which unsound meat may 
be seized ; and state how the same has been extended by a 
more recent Act. 
A.—(a) Section 116 of the Public Health Act 1875 gives 
power to the Medical Officer of Health or Inspector of 
Nuisances to examine at all reasonable times, any animal, 
carcase, meat, poultry, game, flesh, fish, fruit, vegetables, 
corn, bread, flour, or milk exposed for sale or deposited for 
the purpose of sale, or preparation for sale, and intended
-P-A-G-E-69
58 
3 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
for the food of man, and if found unsound, or unwholesome, 
he may seize it as stated in the previous anwer. 
(6) This section has been extended by section 28 of the 
Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1890 (where adopted), to 
apply to all articles intended for the food of man, sold or 
exposed for sale, or deposited in any place for the purpose of 
sale, or of preparation for sale, within the district of any local 
authority, and a justice may condemn any such article, and 
order it to be destroyed or disposed of, if satisfied that 
such article is diseased, unsound, or unwholesome, or unfit 
for the food of man, although it may not have been seized 
as mentioned in section 116 of the Public Health Act, 
1875. 
Q.—Whait are the characteristics of good meat? and describe 
the appearance of a healthy carcase. 
A.—(a) Tt should be firm and elastic, moist but not wet, red 
throughout in colour, except in the case of pork, veal, and 
lamb; if well fed it will be marbled by veins of fat in the 
muscles, It has a fresh, not disagreeable smell; it should 
“set” in 24 hours. The meat juice should slightly redden 
blue litmus paper showing it to be faintly acid. 
(6) A sound, healthy carcase should be well set as soon as 
it is thoroughly cool; it should also be well bled, no part 
- of it being purple, brown or speckled. One side or quarter 
should not be darker than the other. It should not be bile 
stained, and not markedly attenuated. The muscles on being 
pressed with the fingers should not pit, as this indicates the 
presence of water; and should not crackle, as this indicates 
the presence of air. The offal should also be inspected. The 
mouth and tongue should be free from blisters and blotches, 
"°°" “d be firmly attached to the feet. The hide should 
‘ores and pimples." The lungs should be of a 
our, spongy, free from cavities, pus (matter) or 
ction cut off should fioat in water. The heart 
» from bile-staining and blotches. The liver 
snowa ve or a rich brown colour, should not break down 
easily under pressure, and should be free from abscesses and 
flukes. The spleen or milt should be of a dark colour inside, 
and gray on the outside, thin, long and sharp at the edges. 
The stomach should not be inflamed, nor the lining readily 
rub off, and it should not smell of drugs. The bowels should 
have a smooth uninflamed lining, free from ulcers or 
blotches.

4 Q.—Describe the characteristic appearance of a healthy animal ; 
and, has an inspector power to seize a living animal ? 
A,—(a) The animal should be well nourished, able to rise 
without difficulty, and to walk without lameness. Its coat 
should be in good condition, its skin supple, without sores, 
scabs or boils. Its eyes should be bright, its mouth and 
nostrils moist but free from discharge. It should breathe 
easily, almost noiselesly, and its breath should be without 
odour. It should not shiver or give any indication of being 
in pain. 
(6) Yes, he has power; but it will not often happen that 
he is called upon to examine or seize a living animal, and if 
possible he should consult the Medical Officer of Health or a 
veterinary surgeon before seizing it. 
5 Q.—Name the chief causes from which meat may be unwhole- 
some, and give an instance of the fraudulent sale of meat 
by substitution of one kind for another. 
4A,—(a) It may be partially decomposed through being kept 
too long; or it may be from an animal which has died a 
natural death, or only been slaughtered when in a dying state, 
or it may be derived from an animal affected with a disease, 
or be from a poisoned animal. 
(6) The selling of horseflesh when beef is asked for and 
wanted. 
G6 Q.—Deseribe the difference beween ox-flesh, bull-flesh, and 
horse-flesh. 
A,—Ox-flesh when good is bright red in colour (see answer to 
question No. 3); bull-fiesh is tougher, coarser, and darker than 
ox-flesh ; horseflesh is also coarser than ox-flesh, and there is 
a total absence of the small layers of fat between the 
muscle. It has also a characteristic odour, and the fat is 
darker; softer, and more oily than the fat of ox-flesh. It also 
has a peculiar horsey flavour. 
7 Q.—How would you distinguish between refrigerated and 
non-refrigerated beef ? 
A.—Refrigerated or frozen beef can be distinguished by the 
fat, which is all more or less apt to be covered with red 
serum, Also, through defects in transit, sound meat may 
arrive covered with blue mould. Similarly, through being 
carelessly stored on arrival the surface may be allowed to 
grow moist and, tainted,’whilst the carcase remains sound.
-P-A-G-E-71
60 
8 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
It is also the case that frozen meat, which looks very well 
on the surface, may be a little “ gone” near the bone in the 
centre; thus no examination of frozen meat is quite satisfac- 
tory unless the carcase or piece be cut through. American- 
killed carcases are known through being bruised about the 
Tegs, by which they are hoisted previous to slaughter. 
Q.—In what way may articles of food preserved in tins become 
injurious to health? How could you tell without opening 
if the contents of a tin had undergone putrefaction ? \ 
A,—(a) Tinned food may become injurious to health if air 
gains access to the inside of the tins, through defects in the 
sealing process or by rough usage afterwards, or salts of tin, 
zinc or lead may be dissolved in the meat or jelly. 
(6) If putrefaction or decomposition has actually com- 
menced, the tin will show signs of pressure by being bulged 
out, instead of the ends being concave or hollow, caused by 
the vacuum inside. Also, if the tin be turned all round 
close to the nose, and there is the slightest hole in it, the 
contents will give off an offensive smell. 
9 Q.—Describe the characteristic appearance of good/and decom- 
10 posing fish, and how you would proceed to satisfy yourself 
that a, barrel of small fish, ¢.g., sprats, was fit for food. 
A.—(a) Really fresh fish is firm, crisp, and almost rigid. 
The drooping of the tail when the fish is held out horizon- 
tally may be taken as a measure of “ unfreshness.” The eye 
should be full and bright, the gills of a bright red colour, 
and it should give no particular odour. Decomposing fish 
gives off a disagreeable odour, and is very flabby and soft, 
the eyes are sunk and dull, and the gills of a dull red colour. 
(8) If possible I should have the barrel opened first at one 
end and then at the other, or, if I had plenty of time, 
have it emptied out altogether to examine the fish, but fish 
soon smells when it commences to decompose, so that 
opening the barrel at each end and applying the nose would 
easily detect if any decomposition had set in; or, perhaps, 
simply boring a few small holes at various places in the 
barrel with a gimlet and applying the nose, would no doubt 
detect any unsoundness. 
Q.—Are glanders and farcy the same disease, and how would 
you recognise them? What animals suffer from the disease 
and does it render the meat unfit for food ?
-P-A-G-E-72
FOOD INSPECTION, DISEASES OF ANIMALS, ETC. 61 
A.—(a) Yes. They are two forms of the same disease; in 
glanders the chief symptoms are discharge from one or both 
nostrils, with ulceration of the nasal mucous membrane, and 
a swollen condition of the sub-maxillary gland situated on 
the inner side of the lower jaw. In farcy the symptoms are 
a swollen condition of the superficial lymphatic vessels and 
glands, which may often be seen standing out as tender 
nodulated cords. From these nodules or buds as they are 
termed, a sticky discharge very soon exudes, with more or 
less destruction of the skin. ‘This may occur in any part of 
the body, but is most frequently seen in the hind legs, often 
accompanied by general swelling of the limb. 
(8) This disease attacks horses, asses and mules, and may 
be communicated to man. The flesh should undoubtedly be 
condemned. 
11 Q.—Name the diseases of cattle, sheep and swine, which 
more or less render the meat unfit for food. 
A.—In cattle—cattle plague, or, as it is often called, rinder- 
pest, pleuro-pneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax or 
splenic fever, tuberculosis, actinomycosis (wooden tongue) 
and measles. In sheep—foot-and-mouth disease, sheep-pox 
(variola), anthrax, liver-rot (flukes). In pigs—swine fever 
(also called pig-typhoid, hog-cholera, purples, red-soldier, 
blue-soldier, and swine-plague), measles, trichinosis. Also 
in exceptional cases some of the above diseases may affect 
other animals, such as tuberculosis, which may attack sheep, 
pigs, and even horses ; and actinomycosis, which may attack 
the pig and horse in exceptional cases, 
12 Q,—Describe the various signs and appearances of ox-meat 
(1) when putrid, (2) when derived from an animal that has 
died of disease, (3) when of poor quality, 
A.—{1) Meat actually putrid would of course never be offered 
for sale, as it would have turned a greenish colour, but 
before it quite reaches this stage it is partially decomposed, 
when it will be pale and livid on the outside, or the outside 
may be dark coloured, hard and dry. The meat also loses 
its elasticity, is soft and tears readily ; partial decomposition 
is known mainly by the characteristic odour; on cutting it, 
the resistance to the knife varies, some parts being softer 
“than others. The cut surface often swells from a kind of 
fermentation or “heating.” The juice, too, is usually 
alkaline and fails to redden blue litmus paper.
-P-A-G-E-73
62 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
(2) In cases of diseased animals it is very often difficult 
to detect by examination of the meat or flesh, as in some 
diseases the flesh is not affected unless the disease is far 
advanced. The flesh of animals suffering from any in- 
flammatory disease is watery, and decomposes rapidly. In 
cattle plague, if the disease has been well developed, the flesh 
will be dark and flabby, it will not set well, it may crackle 
on pressure, owing to air in the tissues. In measles, the 
flesh when cut in sections is pale and flabby and looks drop- 
sical. In trichinosis the flesh presents a speckled appearance, 
caused by the cysts, within which the little worms are coiled. 
In pleuro-pneumonia, if the disease is far advanced, the flesh 
may be dark in appearance, and the fat tinted yellow from 
bile-staining. In pneumo-enteritis, or swine-fever, if 
the illness has been protracted and severe, the flesh may 
appear pale, flabby and moist. In anthrax there may be 
swelling and tumours in various parts of the tissue, the 
tissue is watery, and the muscles friable, the blood is 
viscid in consistence, but it coagulates only imperfectly. 
It has a peculiar damson-like hue, and is sometimes tarry in 
character. 
(3) Meat of poor quality is generally tough, coarse, and 
stringy; it is generally from aged animals, and will be 
wasted. 
.—How would you recognise measles in a pig ; and in what 
respect does trichinosis differ from measles? Should meat 
affected with these diseases be condemned ? 
A.—(a) Measles can easily be detected in pork on close inspec- 
tion, as the meat looks speckled with little small white bodies 
or worms. The little white specks come out clearer if a 
very thin shaving of the meat be placed on a slip of glass 
and soaked for a short time in a weak solution of caustic 
potash. Daring life these worms or cysts may be found by 
examining the under surface of the tongue, which must be 
pulled out and fixed by inserting a piece of wood between 
the jaws. 
(0) The small thread-like worms (trichina spiralis) which 
are the cause of the disease termed trichinosis, are found 
within the muscular fibres themselves, whereas in measles 
the cysts containing the worms (cysticercus cellulose) are 
situated between the muscle fibres. 
(c) Yes. Meat infected with either of these diseases should 
be condemned.

14 Q.—How would you recognise foot-and-mouth disease, and 
should the entire carcase be condemned % 
A,—(a) This disease principally attacks cattle, but sheep and 
pigs also suffer from it. Usually the only signs of this 
disease are to be found on the tongue and lining membrane 
of the mouth, between the claws of the hoof, and on the 
udders of cows. The eruption consists of blisters, and these 
break and form ulcers. 
(6) As it has not yet been proved that the flesh is in- 
jurious, it is doubtful whether it should be destroyed or not, 
but there is no question as to condemning those parts of the 
animal which are affected by the disease. 
15 Q—Describe briefly the appearances of (a) liver fluke, 
(8) small-pox in sheep, and how would their presence affect 
the fitness of the meat as food ? 
A,—(a) This disease is caused by the presence of worms in 
the liver, and is also termed liver-rot. The worm, which is 
shaped like a sole, measures from an inch to an inch and a 
half in length, attaches itself to the bile-ducts inside the 
liver, and when present in large numbers chokes up the 
ducts, thus destroying the liver. This disease does not affect 
the quality of the flesh, unless it is so far advanced as to 
have caused the animal to become dropsical and bile-stained 
in which case it should be condemned. When it is confined 
to the liver, the liver only need be destroyed. 
(d) This disease is very malignant and fatal to sheep, and 
renders the meat quite unfit for ford. The chief feature of 
the disease is an eruption, which at first resembles flea-bites. 
These become solid pimples in which a clear fluid soon forms 
and then the fluid changes to pus (matter). Presently these 
break and discharge, scabs form which afterwards fall off. 
Apart from these signs the carcase does not present much 
change, except that the glands may be inflamed, and, if the 
animal has suffered severely the flesh will have a disagreeable 
odour, 
16 Q.—How does cattle plague affect the quality of the meat 
as food? Describe the appearance of the meat affected with 
this disease, and is this disease known by any other 
name? 
A,—(a) All authorities are agreed that the flesh of animals 
that have suffered from this disease should be condemned. 
(®) The flesh does not change in appearance except when
-P-A-G-E-75
64 
17 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
the disease is advanced, when it becomes dark and fabby 
and has a disagreeable smell. It will not set well, and it 
may crackle on pressure owing to the presence of air in the 
tissues. Quite early in the disease the lining of the intes- 
tines and air-passages are reddened, and later on more general 
inflammation. : . 
(e) Yes. This disease is also known as “ rinderpest.” 
Q.—In inspecting a carcase to what points should particular 
attention be given to discover whether it is affected with 
pleuro-pneumonia or not, and how does this disease affect 
the quality of the meat as food ? . . 
A,—(a) The only thing noticeable about the meat is that it 
looks dark and ill bled, and this only when the disease 
is well advanced. The principal changes are in the lungs 
themselves; early in the disease the colour of the lungs is in 
great part grey, with red or purple patches or spots, and 
they are less spongy. Later they get darker in colour, 
and growing solid, like liver, will sink in water, the weight 
being much increased, viz. from 7 or 8 lbs. to 30 Ibs. or 
more. The cavity of the chest will most likely contain 
water. If the lungs have been removed the lining mem- 
brane should be examined, as this will probably be thickened 
and roughened, as also will the interior of the chest 
walls, 
(6) It cannot be proved that any injurious effects have 
been caused by the consumption of the flesh of animals 
suffering from this disease, but reasonable grounds exist for 
condemning it, as it is certainly not a sound article. 
18 Q.—What appearances in the carcase would enable you to 
decide that a pig had suffered from swine-fever. If so 
affected would you condemn it, and is the disease known by 
any other names ¢ : : 
A.—(a) The disease does not necessarily produce any marked 
changes in the flesh, but the skin rarely escapes affording 
some indication of the disease ; there is a general or patchy 
redness, or there are large livid blotches, or there is an 
eruption like small-pox, pus being secreted and crusts or 
scabs forming as in human small-pox. The red patches are 
not confined to the skin but may extend to the fat beneath. 
Marked changes will be found in the bowel, especially if the 
disease is far advanced, signs of inflammation are present 
emg 
et,

and often patches of ulceration. The lungs are usually 
congested or inflamed. 
(6) Yes; I should unhesitatingly condemn the carcase, 
(c) Yes; other names are “ pig-typhoid,” ‘ hog-cholera,” 
“yred-soldier,” “blue-soldier,” “purples” and “swine- 
plague”; the proper name is pneumo-enteritis. 
19 Q.—What are the chief differences in the carcase of the 
horse and the ox? 
A,—The horse has eighteen ribs on each side while the ox 
has only thirteen ; in the latter they are broader, flatter and 
less arched and are united to the cartilages by joints, while 
those of the horse have a fixed union. The breastbone of 
the ox is flat above and below while that of the horse is 
keel-shaped or flat sideways. The bones of the horse are 
mostly larger than those of the ox and contain more fatty 
matter of an oily consistence. The horse’s tongue is broad 
at the end while that of the ox is pointed, and the upper 
surface of the tongue of the ox is rough, The liver of the 
ox forms one continuous mass with one small segment or 
lobe at the upper and back part; it has a gall-bladder 
attached. The liver of the horse is formed of three large 
lobes and a small one; it has no gall-bladder. The heart of 
the ox is more conical or pear-shaped than that of the horse, 
and in its base it has a bone which is not found in the heart 
of the horse. 
20 Q.—Name the diseases of the cow which may render the 
milk unfit for food. 
A.—Cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, 
garget (or inflammation of the udder), tuberculosis, puerperal 
fever and anthrax. 
21 Q.—Deseribe briefly the appearance of the lungs of an ox 
affected with tuberculosis, and explain what is meant by 
“stripping ” when a carcase is prepared for sale, 
A.—(a) Rounded growths at first scarcely visible to the 
naked eye form in the tissues. These increase in size until 
as large or even larger than a pigeon’s egg. It is these 
growths that cause this disease to be known as the “ grapes” 
and “pearl disease.” These small growths when cut into 
have a yellow appearance and sometimes a cheesy consistency, 
at other times they are hard and gritty. As the disease 
advances the lung is apt to break up and abscesses may form 
E
-P-A-G-E-77
66 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
in its substance. The favourite site for the growths is on 
the surface of the lung and on the walls of the chest, they 
afterwards invade the interior of the lung, giving rise to 
inflammation of that organ. 
(b) The butcher often removes the lungs and strips the 
internal covering from the chest walls before offering the 
carease for sale, A careful inspection of the chest-walls and 
the damping with a wet cloth will make the torn fibres 
become opaque, and thus it will be seen that the lining (or 
pleura) has been removed. 
22 Q.—Describe the characteristic appearance of a carcase 
affected by anthrax, Should it be condemned, and what 
disease does this produce in man ? 
A._(a) Anthrax attacks cattle, sheep and swine. There are 
three forms: (1) the least frequent is marked by large boils; 
(2) black-quarter, one limb or more dark and swollen ; (3) 
splenic fever ; flesh dark, bile-stained and dropsical. Liver 
large and soft, lungs generally inflamed. Spleen enlarged 
to twice or thrice its natural size, and edges rounded. 
(b) Yes; the flesh should be unhesitatingly condemned. 
(c) Woolsorter’s disease. 
23 Q.—Large numbers of carcases of calves are imported into this 
country from abroad ata certain period of the year, Under 
what conditions would you consider such carcases unfit for 
human consumption ? 
A.—J should consider that they were unfit for human food if 
I found that the animals had suffered from any such disease 
as tuberculosis, anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, cattle 
plague, &c., and also if they were what is termed “ slink” 
meat, that is, cast prematurely or dying during or soon 
after birth. I should notice the hoofs and bowels (if present 
with carcase); the former should have hardened and the latter 
have passed the black slimy matter, if not I should seize it 
as unfit for food. 
24 Q.—How would you recognise actinomycosis and hydatid 
cysts? Should the flesh of animals suffering from these 
diseases be condemned ? 
A.—(a) Actinomycosis specially affects the ox and is caused 
by the “ray fungus”; it mostly attacks the tongue and 
adjacent tissues, including the jaw, but it may invade the 
bones, and also the lungs, The tongue is hard and dense
-P-A-G-E-78
FOOD INSPECTION, DISEASES OF ANIMALS, ETC. 67 
(wooden tongue) and very much enlarged, so much so that 
it may protrude from the mouth, and on being cut into it 
presents a nodular appearance. When the disease occurs in 
the lung it is likely to be mistaken for tuberculosis, which it 
closely resembles. Hydatid cysts are a dangerous parasite 
affecting the liver and other parts of the body under the 
name of hydatid disease. It affects the dog and wolf only, 
so that good reasons exist for excluding dogs from slaughter- 
houses. The head of the worm (it is a tapeworm) is similar 
to that of the tenia soliwm of measles, but it is only p3y of 
an inch in width. There are four segments only, and the 
whole tapeworm is about a quarter of an inch long. 
(b) There is no doubt that all parts affected should be 
seized and condemned, but opinions differ as to condemning 
the whole carcase, some maintaining that the whole carcase 
should be seized and destroyed. ree

Local Authority shall, by written notice, require the owner or 
occupier, within a reasonable time therein specified, to provide 
same; and if such notice is not complied with the Local 
Authority may do the work and recover the expenses in a 
summary manner.” 
(6) An earth-closet is defined as “ any place for the recep- 
tion and deodorisation of fecal matter constructed to the 
satisfaction of the Local Authority.” The term ashpit is ex-

cleansing or removal at such intervals as they may think fit, 
on the occupier of any such premises, 
15 Q.—Under what circumstances is a Local Authority responsible 
for the removal of refuse from premises, and does the term 
“refuse” apply to the refuse from any trade or manufac- 
turing process ? 
A.—(a) Where they undertake its removal themselves, or 
contract for its removal, they are responsible for the removal 
of house refuse. 
(4) No; it only applies to house (or domestic) refuse; and 
if the Local Authority were to remove trade refuse they could 
make a charge for same. 
16 Q.—Can an Urban Authority order the periodical removal of 
manure from stables? Also state what notice is required to 
be given to any person for the removal of any accumulation 
of offensive matter on premises ? 
A.—(a) Yes; section 50 of the Public Health Act, 1875, 
gives power to Urban Authorities to give notice (by public 
announcement or otherwise) requiring the periodical removal 
of manure cr other refuse matter from mews, stables, or other 
premises under a penalty not exceeding 20s. per day for

harmless as far as practicable any gases, vapours,.dust, or 
other impurities, generated in the course of the work carried 
on therein, that are a nuisance or injurious to health, or 
so overcrowded while work is carried on as to be dangerous 
or injurious to the health of those employed therein. 
(7) Any fireplace or furnace which does not as far as prac- 
ticable consume the smoke arising from the combustible 
used therein, and which is used for working engines by steam, 
orin any mill, factory, dyehouse, brewery, bakehouse, or 
gaswork, or in any manufacturing or trade process what- 
soever; and any chimney (not being the’ chimney of a 
private dwelling-house) sending forth black smoke in such 
quantity as to be a nuisance, shall be deemed to be nuisances 
liable to be dealt with summarily, in manner provided by 
this Act. 
Norse.—By the Quarry Fencing Act of 1887, any quarry

similar structure used for human habitation, which is in such 
a state as to be a nuisance or injurious to health, or which is 
so overerowded as to be injurious to the health of the in- 
mates, whether or not members of the same family, is also 
deemed to be'a similar nuisance. 
19 Q.—If you find a nuisance to exist on any premises, what 
steps would you take ? 
A.—On receipt of any information of the existence of a 
nuisance, ur on finding any nuisance, I should if possible 
investigate the cause, and report the matter at once to the 
Sanitary Authority, who as soon as satisfied of the same shall 
serve a notice wn the person by whose act, default or suffer- 
ance the nuisance arises or continues; or, if such person 
cannot be found, on the owner or occupier of the premises 
op which the nuisance arises, requiring him to abate the 
same within a specified time, and to execute such works and 
do such things as may be necessary for that purpose. If the 
nuisance arises from structural defect or want of structural 
convenience, or where there: is no occupier, notice to be 
served on the owner. Where the person causing the nuisance 
cannot be found, and the nuisance does not arise or continue 
by the act, default, or sufferance of the owner or occupier of 
the premises, the Local Authority may abate the same without 
further order (Public Health Act, 1875, section 94). If this 
notice is not complied with, or if the nuisance, though abated, 
is likely to recur, the Local Authority shall make complaint 
to a justice, who shall summon the person on whom the 
notice was served (section 95). The Court may make an 
order dealing with the nuisance, or a recurring order, or both, 
and may also impose a penalty and give costs (section 96).

mulation of (a) refuse from a dwelling-house, (0) trade refuse ? 
A.—(a) If the Local Authority do this work themselves or 
employ a contractor I should report it at once to the clerk 
or the foreman responsible for the work. If the Local 
Authority do not do this work themselves, nor employ a con- 
tractor, I should serve a notice under section 49 of the 
Public Health Act, 1875, giving the owner or occupie. 
twenty-four hours’ notice to remove the refuse ; also, 
(6) Twenty-four hours’ notice should be served under the 
same Act and section for the removal of trade refuse. (See 
Answer to Question 16 of this lesson.)

21 Q.—Define.the terms “ Local Authority,” “lands,” “ premises,” 
and “curtilage.” _ 
A.—* Local Authorities” are either Urban or Rural Sanitary 
Authorities, The Urban Sanitary Authorities are for urban 
districts and the rural Sanitary Authorities are for rural 
districts. Urban districts are either boroughs composed of 
mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, acting by the council, or 
districts under an Urban District Council. Rural districts 
are areas which were previously under the guardians of the 
union, and are now governed by Rural District Councils. 
“Tands” and “ premises” are defined to include messuages, 
buildings, lands, easements, and hereditaments of any tenure. 
“Qurtilage” has been defined as a “courtyard, backside, or 
piece of ground lying near to a dwelling-house” (Wuarton). 
22 Q,—You are sent to take an hour’s observation of the smoke 
issuing from a certain factory chimney. In what form would 
you make your notes as the observation proceeded, so that 
they could be referred to for evidence in a court of law? 
A.—The inspector should have a pocket-book with lines ruled 
horizontally for a portion of the page, on which should 
follow consecutively the following : 
Name of firm. 
Description of works. 
Where situate. 
Number of observation. 
Number of boilers. 
Place of observation. 
Date of observation.

be kept by a sanitary inspector. Suggest a form for the 
register of workshops which Sanitary Authorities are required 
to keep under section 131 of the Factory and Workshops Act. 
A,.—(a) The following registers should be kept in a Sanitary 
or Pablic Health Department (of course, all the book-keeping 
could not be done by the sanitary inspector in a large town 
or district, so that some of these registers would be kept 
by the clerk or clerks) : 
Prosecution register ; 
Infectious diseases register ; 
Disinfecting register ; 
Registers of factories and workshops, also outworkers and 
contractors ; 
Registers of common lodging-houses and houses let in 
lodgings ; 
Register of cowsheds, dairies and milkshops ; 
Register of slaughter-houses and offensive trades ; 
Register for canal-boats used as dwellings, and 
Register of persons from whom samples are purchased 
under the Food and Drugs Acts, articles purchased, and 
results of analysis. It would also be advisable to keep a 
register of places where horseflesh is sold.

24 Q.—What are “back-to-back” houses? What are their 
sanitary disadvantages? How may the conditions of such 
houses be ameliorated without demolishing them ? 
A.—(a) Houses in which the rear or back walls form a party 
wall between them, that is, they have no open space in the rear.
-P-A-G-E-91
80 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
(4) It is impossible to ventilate these houses thoroughly, no 
through draft is possible, as it is in a through house. Also, 
very often the drainage and sanitary conveniences are open 
to great improvements, as where these houses are built in 
blocks of four, with passages between each block, and bed- 
rooms over the passages; the drains from the w.c.s run 
under this passage, and if any leakage takes place it finds its 
way into the cellars adjoining; also, the sinks of all four 
houses are grouped together and discharge over one common 
gully in the centre of the passage, which soon gets choked 
with coal dust, &c., and overflows into the cellars down the 
coal grates. The w.c.s (or very often the privies) and ash- 
pits are situated in the yards fronting the back houses (there 
are front houses fronting the street and back houses facing 
the yards), and all the refuse, é&c., is kept close to these back 
houses. 
(c) Fix inlet and outlet ventilators such as Tobin’s tubes 
and Boyle's mica flap valves in every room, and, if the houses 
are built in a long terrace, pull down one or two at intervals 
to allow of the free circulation of the wind to the rear, Lay 
drain embedded in 6 inches of Portland cement concrete, or 
iron pipes, to prevent leakage into the cellars; take down 
ashpits and substitute galvanised circular dust-bins, covered 
to keep out the wet, and empty weekly. If there are privies, 
convert them into water-closets.

LESSON VIII 
COMMON LODGING-HOUSES, CELLAR 
DWELLINGS, ETC. 
1 Q.—Define the the term ‘ common lodging-house.” 
A.—There is no legal definition of a common lodging-house, 
but it has been defined as “that class of lodging-house in 
which persons of the poorer class are received for short, 
- periods, and, though strangers to one another, are allowed 
to inhabit one common room.” 
2 Q.—Can an inspector demand an entrance into a common . 
lodging-house at any hour? and name the minimum cubic 
space allowance for each adult in sleeping rooms. 
A—({a) Yes. Section 85 of the Public Health Act, 1875, 
says: “ All persons having, or acting in management of such 
houses, shall at all times, when required by any officer of 
Local Authority, admit him to any part ;” penalty in default 
£5. 
(6) The model bylaw of the Local Government Board 
allows 300 cubic feet for each adult. 
3. Q.—What power has a Local Authority to require the keeper 
of a common lodging-house to obtain a proper water-supply, 
to limewash walls and ceilings, and to give notice of infec- 
tious disease ? 
A,—(a) Where a common lodging-house is without a proper 
supply of water for use of lodgers, and it appears to the Local 
Authority that such could be obtained at a reasonable cost, 
they may require the owner to provide seme within a given 
time on pain of removal of house from register (section 81 
of Public Health Act, 1875). 
__ (6) Keepers shall limewash walls and ceilings in first week 
of October and A pril to the satisfaction of the Local Authority 
F
-P-A-G-E-93
82 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
on pain of a penalty of £2 (section 82 of the Public Health 
Act, 1875). 
(c) All keepers shall immediately report to the Medical 
Officer of Health and Relieving Officer, any case of fever or 
infectious disease under a penalty not exceeding £5, and a 
daily penalty not exceeding £2. 
4 Q.—Give briefly the rules in the model bylaws which 
should guide the inspector in his examination of premises to 
be registered as a common lodging-house. 
A.—The house should possess the conditions of wholesome- 
ness needed for dwelling-houses in general, and it should 
further have arrangements fitting it for its special purpose of 
receiving a given number of lodgers. 
5 Q. On what matters are Local Authorities required to make 
bylaws for common lodging-houses ? 
A.—Section 80 of the Public Health Act, 1875, says: “ Every 
Local Authority shall make bylaws for 
“(1) Fixing and varying the number of lodgers and for 
separation of the sexes in common lodging-houses ; 
“ (2) Promoting cleanliness and ventilation ; 
“ (8) Notification and precautions in case of infectious 
disease ; 
(4) The general well ordering of such houses.”

of accommodation of other kinds; as kitchen and day-room 
accommodation, w.c.s, &. 
18 Q.—State briefly the precautions that a common lodging-house 
keeper must take-in the event of any lodger suffering from 
an infectious disease ? 
A,—Every keeper of a common lodging-house, immediately he

of any infectious disease, shall adopt all such precautions as 
may be necessary to prevent the spread. He shall not allow 
any person except wife or relation, or other person voluntarily 
in charge of such lodger, to use or occupy the same room. 
If the Sanitary Authority order the removal of such lodger

20 Q.—For what matters isa Local Authority empowered to make 
bylaws affecting “ houses let in lodgings?” 
A.—By section 90 of the Public Health Act, 1875, the Local 
Government Board may, if they think fit, by notice published 
in the London Gazette, declare the following enactment to be

any Local Authority, and, from and after the publication of 
such notice, such Local Authority shall be empowered to make 
bylaws for the following matters : 
(1) For fixing, and from time to time varying, the number 
of persons who may occupy a house, or part of a house, which

A,—In rooms used exclusively as sleeping-apartments, 300 
cubic feet for adults, and 150 cubic feet for children under 
10 years of age. In rooms which are not exclusively used 
as sleeping-apartments 400 cubic feet for adults, and 200 
cubic feet for children under 10 years of age. 
22 Q.—What does the Public Health Act, 1875, say regarding 
the registering of common lodging-houses 2 
A,—Section 76 of the Public Health Act, 1875, says: “ Every 
Local Authority shall keep a regisier of all common lodging- 
houses, number of lodgers that may be received, and names 
and addresses of keepers, uc.” Section 77 says: “ No one may
-P-A-G-E-99
88 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
keep a common lodging-house unless he or she, and the 
house is registered,” &c., and section 78 says: “No house 
shall be registered until it has been inspected and approved by 
some officer of the Local Authority, and the Local Authority 
may refuse to register any person without such certificate of 
good character as they may prescribe, signed by three inhabi- 
tant householders in the district, rated at £6. 
23 Q.—A room in a common lodging-house is 20 feet square on 
plan, and the walls are 7 feet high; the ceiling slopes on 
every side to the centre of the room, where it is 12 feet high 
above the floor. What is the cubic contents of the room, and 
how many adults should be allowed to sleep in it ? 
A.—(a) Cubic contents of portion cf room up to top of walls 
equals 20 feet x 20 feet x 7 =2800 cubic feet. The portion 
above walls is a pyramid on a base 20 feet square and 5 feet 
high. To find the contents of a pyramid, find the area of 
base and multiply the result by one-third the height; or 
multiply by height and divide by 3 ; thus, 20 x 20 = 400 square 
feet. Multiply this (the area of base) by 5 (height) = 2000, 
and divide by 3 = 666-66 cubic feet. Add together the 2500 
and the 666-66 =3466-66 = cubic feet in room. 
(2) If we take the room to be properly ventilated, and the 
other necessary accommodation to be satisfactory, we then 
allow the minimum of 300 cubic feet per adult person to 
sleep in room. Divide 3466:66 by 300 = 11 adults and 
166-66 cubic feet over, which would allow for one child under 
10 years of age, or would be fully taken up by beds, bodies 
of persons, &c. 
24 Q.—Give a schedule, or notice, for a common lodging-house 
suitable for the sanitary authority to send to the keeper 
after they have registered him.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES ACTS 
1 Q.—Do the provisions of the Infectious Diseases Notification 
Act, 1889, and the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890, 
only apply after adoption by a Local Authority ; if so, state 
how they may be adopted ? 
A,—(a) Only after they have been adopted. 
(8) Any Sanitary Authority may by resolution adopt all or 
any of the sections of these Acts. Fourteen days notice 
must be given of the meeting and business; the resolution 
when carried must be advertised in local newspapers, pub- 
lished by handbills in district, or otherwise, and come into 
operation not less than one month afterwards. A copy of 
the resolution must be sent to the Local Government Board, 
2 Q.—Name the objects of the Infectious Diseases Notification 
Act, 1889, and the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890. 
A,—The objects of the above Acts are, briefly, to secure the 
early notification, or knowledge, of the outbreak of infectious 
diseases, and thus to be able to take the necessary steps by 
isolation, disinfection, &c., to prevent the disease spreading. 
3 Q.—Give a list of the diseases enumerated as compulsorily 
notifiable in the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889. 
A.—Section 6 of the Act gives the following as dangerous in- 
fectious diseases, viz., Small-pox, cholera, scarlet fever, 
typhoid or enteric fever, typhus fever, diphtheria, mem- 
branous croup, erysipelas, and the fevers known as puerperal, 
continued, and relapsing. 
+ Q.—What are the powers of a Local Authority as regards 
ordering premises to be disinfected? Has section 120 of the 
Public Health Act, 1875, been repealed ?
-P-A-G-E-102
INFECTIOUS DISEASES ACTS 91 
A,—(a) Section 120 of the Public Health Act, 1875, says: 
““ Where the Local Authority is of opinion on the certificate 
of the Medical Officer of Health, or other legally qualified 
medical practitioner, that the cleansing and disinfecting of 
any house or part thereof, and of any articles therein, would 
tend to prevent the spread of infectious disease, it is ineum- 
bent upon the Sanitary Authority to serve notice upon the 
owner or occupier requiring him to cleanse and disinfect.” 
Or, the Sanitary Authority may do the work, with the 
consent of the owner or occupier, at their own cost. 
(b) No; it has not been repealed unless section 5 of the 
Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890, has been adopted, 
when it is repealed by this section, 
5 Q.—In what respects does section 5 of the Infectious Diseases 
Prevention Act, 1890, amend section 120 of the Public 
Health Act, 1875 ? 
A,—By section 5 of the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 
1890, on receipt of certificate the Local Authority shall give 
notice in writing to the owner or occupier that the Local 
Authority will cleanse and disinfect, at his cost, if he does 
not do it himself, within twenty-four hours, to the satisfac- 
tion of the Medical Officer of Health. If he fails to doo, the 
Local Authority may enter, by their officer, on producing 
written authority, do the work and recover the cost. It is 
section 17 of the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890, 
which gives power to enter. 
6 Q—State what powers a Local Authority has for dealing 
with infected bedding and clothing. 
A,—Sections 121 and 122 of the Public Health Act, 1875, 
provide for the destruction, when necessary, of infected 
bedding and clothing (with due compensation), and also for 
disinfection of such articles in a proper place and with proper 
apparatus; the Local Authority may make a charge or not, as 
they please. Where the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act 
is adopted, section 6 extends the above powers, by permitting 
the Medical Officer of Health to direct in writing, such 
disinfection and adds a penalty for non-compliance. Com- 
pensation for any damage done by disinfecting is limited to 
unnecessary or avoidable damage. 
7 7 Q.-~In the case of a provision of the Infectious Diseases Notifi- 
cation Act, 1889, or of the Infectious Diseases Prevention
-P-A-G-E-103
92 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
Act, 1890, being similar to some provision of a local Act, can 
proceedings still be taken under the local act ? 
A,.—No; both these Acts supersede like provisions of local 
Acts, where they are adopted. (Section 14 of the Infectious 
Diseases Notificatioa Act, 1899, and section 19 of the Infec- 
tious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890.) : 
8 Q.—Give the section and state the provisions of the Public 
Health Act, 1875, with regard to the exposure of infected 
persons and things.

expose himself wilfully, without proper precautions against 
spreading the disorder, in any street, public place, inn, or 
public conveyance, or to enter any public conveyance without 
previously notifying the owner, conductor, or driver thereof 
that he is so suffering, or, being in charge of such sufferer, 
to expose such sufferer, or to give, lend, sell, transmit, or 
expose, without previous disinfecting, any bedding, clothing, 
rage, or other things, which have been exposed to infection 
from any such disorder.” : 
9 Q—What notification of an infectious disease is required 
under the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889? 
A.—Section 3 of this Act says: “ When any person is suffering 
from an infectious disease, the head of the family, orthe nearest 
relative, or any person in attendance on, or in charge of, the 
patient, or the master of the house, shall, as soon as aware 
of the nature of the disease, send notice thereof to the Medical 
Officer of Health. Every medical man attending on, or called 
to, the patient, shall, in like manner, send a certificate stating 
full name, age, and sex of the patient, the full postal address 
of the house, and the nature of the disease.” Also, whether 
in his private or official practice, &c. Any person failing to 
notify is liable to a fine not exceeding £2, unless they had 
good reason to believe that notice had been sent. 
10 Q.—Under what circumstances may a person suffering from 
an infectious disease be removed to a hospital ? 
A.—The Public Health Act, 1875, section 124, provides that

INFECTIOUS DISEASES ACTS - 98 
qualified medical practitioner, be removed to any hospital 
within the district of the Local Authority, or within a con- 
venient distance outside the district, and to which the Local 
Authority have access or a right of use; also, any person so 
suffering who is lodged in a common lodging-house may be so 
removed.” 
Note.—There is no power of absolute compulsion given, 
but any person obstructing or wilfully disobeying the order 
made by a justice, or by the Local Authority, is liable to a 
penalty not exceeding £10. 
11 Q.—-State the law with regard to the infectious dead, and 
define the term “ public conveyance.” 
A.—(a) Section 142 of the Public Health Act, 1875, provides 
that ‘‘where the body of one who has died of any infectious 
disease is retained in a room in which persons live or sleep, 
or any dead body which is in such a state as to endanger the 
health of the inmates of the same house or room, is retained 
in such house or room, any justice may, on a certificate 
signed by a legally qualified medical practitioner, order the 
‘body to be removed, at the cost of the Local Authority, to 
any mortuary provided by such Authority, and may direct the 
time in which the body is to be buried, unless friends or 
relations undertake to bury the body in the time stated, the 
relieving officer shall bury such body and recover expenses 
from apy person liable to pay the expenses of such burial. 
Any person obstructing an order made by a justice under 
this section is liable to a penalty not exceeding £5.” This 
section is supplemented by section 8 of the Infectious 
Diseases Prevention Actas follows: “No person, without the 
sanction in writing of the Medical Officer of Health, or of a 
registered medical practitioner, shall retain unburied else- 
where than in a public mortuary (or in a room not used at 
the time as a dwelling-place, sleeping-place, or workroom) for 
more than forty-eight hours, the body of any person who 
has died of infectious disease.” Also section 11 of the 
Infectious Diseases Prevention Act provides that, ‘The body 
of any person who has died from an infectious disease must 
not be conveyed in any public conveyance other than a 
hearse, without due notice to the owner or driver, and he 
shall, under a penalty, at once cause the conveyance to be 
disinfected.” 
(6) A “public conveyance” is understood to be one which 
plies openly for hire.
-P-A-G-E-105
94 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
12 Q.—Under what circumstances is the disinfecting of public 
conveyances required by law? 
A,.—Section 127 of the Public Health Act, 1875, provides 
that: The owner or driver of any public conveyance, after 
conveying an infected person, is required under a penalty to 
have the same disinfected, and is permitted to make an extra 
cbarge for conveying such a person, Also, a hearse must be 
disinfected after conveying the body of any person who has 
died from an infectious disease. (See last question and 
answer.) 
13 Q.—Is it an offence to allow infectious rubbish to be cast into 
an ashpit ? . 
A.—Yes; section 13 of the Infectious Diseases Prevention 
Act, 1890, provides that : “ Any person who shall knowingly 
cast, or cause or permit to be cast, into any ashpit, ashtub, or 
other receptacle for the deposit of refuse matter, any in- 
fectious rubbish without previous disinfection, shall be guilty 
of an offence under this Act.” 
14 Q.—Is a Local Authority required to provide a temporary 
shelter, free of charge, for a family turned out of their 
dwelling for disinfection, dc. ? 
A,—Yes; where the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act 
1890, is adopted, as Section 15 provides that : “The Sanitary 
Authority shall provide free temporary shelter, with any 
necessary attendance, for the members of any family in 
which infectious disease has appeared, who have to leave 
their dwelling to allow of its disinfection by the Sanitary 
Authority.” 
Note.—This is a wise provision, as otherwise the people 
would go into friends’ and neighbours’ houses, and thus 
spread the disease if any of them are affected. 
15 Q.—What action can the Local Authority take. against a 
person letting a house wherein an infectious disease has 
occurred, before the house has been disinfected ? 
A,—The Public Health Act, 1875, section 128 says: “ Any

ment as to infectious disease having recently occurred in a 
house or room % . .
-P-A-G-E-106
“Y 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES ACTS 95 
A.—Yes; section 129 of the Public Health Act, 1875, says: 
“Any person letting or offering for hire any house, or part 
of a house, who, on being questioned as to the fact of there 
being (or within six weeks previously having been) therein 
any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, 
knowingly makes a false answer to such question, becomes 
liable to a penalty or imprisonment.” 
17 Q.—Is a person liable to a penalty who ceases to occupy a 
house, without previously disinfecting it, or giving notice to 
the owner that it required disinfecting, after a case of in- 
fectious disease ? 
A.—Yes; if the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890, 
has been adopted, as section 7 says: “ Every person on ceas- 
ing to occupy a house or room in which infectious disease 
has been known to exist within six weeks without having it 
disinfected or informing the owner or master, or who makes 
a false declaration as to the fact, shall be liable to a penalty 
not exceeding £20, or, to imprisonment not exceeding one 
month with, or without, hard labour.” 
18 Q.—Give a brief summary of the Cholera Regulations accord- 
ing to the order of the Local Government Board of August 
28th, 1890. 
A.—KEvery port Sanitary Authority, or other Sanitary 
Authority, within whose district persons are likely to be landed 
from ships ‘‘coming foreign,” must appoint a place for mooring 
ships infected with cholera, and make provision for the re- 
ception of chulera patients and of persons suffering from ill- 
ness which is suspected to be cholera. A ship infected with 
cholera must hoist a yellow flag when within three miles of 
the coast of England and Wales. When the customs officer 
finds on boarding a vessel, that there has been a ease of 
cholera on board, he must detain the ship, order the master 
to anchor in a specified place, and forthwith give notice to 
the Sanitary Authority of the place at which the ship is about 
to call. If the Medical Officer of Health has reason to believe 
that the ship is infected with cholera, he must forthwith visit 
and examine the ship, and he may do so if the ship comes 
from a place infected with cholera. If he finds that there 
has been a case on board, he must certify the same to the 
master, who must moor in the place appointed. The Medical 
Officer of Health then examines all on board, and all found 
suffering from cholera may be either detained on the ship
-P-A-G-E-107
96 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
or insome place provided by the Sanitary Authority if their 
condition permit of it, and must not leave until the Medical 
Officer of Health certifies that they are free from the disease. 
If they cannot be removed the ship remains subject to the 
control of the Medical Officer of Health, without whose 
written consent the infected persons cannot leave the ship. 
Persons certified by the Medical Officer of Health to be 
suffering from an illness which he suspects may prove to be 
cholera may be detained either on ship or in sonte place pro- 
vided by the Sanitary Authority, for not“‘more than two days, 
to ascertain whether it is cholera or not. No person to land 
(unless certified) unless he satisfies the Medical Officer of 
Health as to his name, place of destination, and address at 
such ; the Medical Officer of Health gives names, &c., to the 
clerk to the Sanitary Authority who forwards them to the 
Sanitary Authority of the districts in question. The Medical 
Officer of Health gives such directions, and takes such steps 
as appear to him to be necessary, for preventing the spread 
of infection, and the master of the ship must carry out such 
directions as are given tohim. In the event of a death from 
cholera on board, the master must, as directed by the Sanitary 
Authority, either bury the body at sea, properly weighted, or 
deliver it to the Sanitary Authority for interment. He must 
destroy all articles soiled with cholera discharges, and_disin- 
fect, and, if necessary, destroy the clothing, bedding, and other 
articles of personal use likely to retain infection, and disinfect 
the ship. If the vessel is not infected with cholera, but has 
passengers on board who are in a filthy or otherwise un- 
wholesome condition, the Medical Officer of Health may 
certify to the master that it is desirable, with a view to pre- 
vent the introduction of cholera, that all persons leaving the 
ship must satisfy him as to their names and addresses, and 
the same measures are to be taken as in the case of persons 
permitted to leave an infected ship. . 
19 Q.—State how the Cholera Regulations Order of August 1890 
has been amended by the order of August 1892? 
A,—It forbids the landing of any “ rags, bedding, disused or 
filthy clothing, whether belonging to emigrants-or otherwise, 
from any foreign port in Europe, north of Dunkirk, other 
than ports of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.” 
Note.—This order has been so modified by the order issued 
January 11th, 1893, as to allow exemption in case of rags duly 
certified not to have come from any places in which cholera

had been prevalent. It was not rescinded by the Order 
dated August 5, 1893, which substituted other regulations as 
to dirty bedding, &c., not being landed except for the purpose 
of disinfection or destruction, and the countries are specified 
in the order. 
20 Q.—State what diseases in your opinion should be considered 
infectious in addition to those given in Section 6 of the In- 
fectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889 ? 
A.—Consumption, measles, chicken-pox, whooping-cough and 
influenza, all of which are highly infectious. 
21 Q.—Give a specimen of the weekly or monthly report suitable 
for returns after a case of infectious disease.

obtains and that sent in to the Medical Officer of Health the 
following particulars can be entered in a suitable register,

Remarks. 
Wote.—The above are simply headings to the columns in 
the register. 
Q.—What powers have Urban Authorities with respect to 
(a) hospital accommodation; (6) formation of a joint 
hospital ? 
A.—(a) Section 131 of the Public Health Act, 1875, gives power 
to Local Authorities to provide district hospitals or temporary 
place for the reception of sick, for which purpose they may 
themselves build such hospitals, enter into an agreement with 
any person for the use of hospital, or contract for a hospital 
building. 
(8) The same section provides for two or more local 
authorities combining in providing a joint or common 
hospital. 
24 Q.—Do the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875, and of 
the Infectious Diseases Acts apply to ships ? 
A.—Yes; section 110 of the Public Health Act, 1875, pro- 
vides that: For the purpose of this Act any vessel (not 
belonging to H.M, Government) lying in waters within a 
sanitary district shall be deemed to be a house, and its 
master the occupier. When the ship is in water which is 
not within the district of any Sanitary Authority, it shall be 
deemed to be in that of the nearest. This section brings 
ships under the scope of the Public Health Act, 1875, for 
nuisances only ; but the Public Health (Ships) Aet of 1875 
extended its scope to include also sections 120, 121, 124, 
125, 126, 128, 131, 132, and 133, thus including infectious 
diseases and hospitals, The Infectious Diseases Notification 
Act, 1889, and the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890, 
apply only after adoption in any district ; when adopted, they 
apply to ships the same as to houses.

LESSON X 
FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACT, HOUSING OF 
THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, AND THE 
SHOP HOURS ACT 
eae 1 Q—Define broadly. the difference between,_a factory, and a 
~workshop~ 
A.—The.primary, distinction between them appears to be 
that in a factory steam or some*other mechanical power is 
used in aid of the manufacturing processes, and in workshops 
manual labour only is used. 
In Part I of Schedule VI. of the Factory and Workshops 
Act, 1901, many other places are given as factories whether 
mechanical power is used or not, as print works, bleaching 
and dyeing works, earthenware works, lucifer match works, 
percussion-cap works, cartridge works, paper-staining works, 
fustian-cutting works, blast furnaces, copper mills, iron mills, 
foundries, metal and india-rubber works, paper mills, glass 
works, tohacco factories, letterpress printing works, book- 
binding works, flax scutch mills and electrical stations. 
2 Q.—What powers have Sanitary Authorities in regard to (a) 
factories, (b) workshops ? 
A.—(a) Factories are under the factory inspectors, but in 
districts where Part 3 of the Public Health. 
1800, 3s in force, every building. used as a workshop or 
manufactory, or where persons are employed, or intended to 
be employed, in any trade or business, must be provided with 
sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary 
conveniences (section 22). The surveyor reports to the 
Sanitary Authority, and they may serve a notice on the 
owner or occupier to provide same. Also, if more than forty 
persons are employed, the Sanitary Authority may enforce 
means of escape in case of fire.

(6) The Sanitary Authority and their officers shall, with- 
out prejudice to their other powers, have all such powers of 
entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings or otherwise as 
an inspector under this Act (Factory Inspector). This is for 
workshops and workplaces. (Section 125 of Factory and 
Workshops Act, 1901.) 
3 Q. Are District Councils required to keep a register of the 
workshops in their districts? Also suggest a form for such a 
register. 
A,—(a) Every District Council shall keep a register of all 
workshops situate within their district. oe 
(8) See Answer (6) to Question 28, Lesson 7. 
4 Q—-Explain the duty of a Sanitary Inspector with reference to - 
“sanitary accommodation in factories and workshops. 
A,—In districts where Section 22 of the Public Health 
(Amendment) Act, 1890, is in force the Council may serve 
notice on the owner or occupier of a workshop or manufactory, 
requiring him to provide sufficient and suitable sanitary 
accommodation on a report from their surveyor that this 
requirement is not observed. And in districts where this 
Act is not in force the Council may deal with this matter 
under Section 38 of the Public Health Act, 1875, subject to 
the observance of any order made by the Secretary of State 
under Section 9 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 190}. 
In the first case the Sanitary Inspector has no duties except 
he be required to report to the Council or surveyor should he 
somehow discover that there is not sufficient or suitable 
sanitary accommodation, In the latter case he must report 
to the Sanitary Authority. 
1 
5 Q.—Mention briefly the duties of a District Council in regard 
to workshops and workplaces. 
A.—The District Council is made responsible for the sanitary 
condition of the workshops and workplaces in their district, 
and “Sanitary Conditions” include (a) cleanliness, (d) air- 
space, (c) ventilation, and (d) drainage of the floors. For 
these purposes the provisions of section 91 of the Public 
Health Act, 1875, apply to all workshops and workplaces 
and are supplemented by certain additional provisions in the 
Factory Act 
 
-P-A-G-E-112

8 FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACT, ETC. 101 
Q.—State the law with regard to cleanliness in workshops and 
workplaces. 
A.—Section 2 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, says: 
Every workshop and workplace must be kept in a cleanly 
state and free from effluvia ; and if not so kept. they may be 
dealt. with under section 91 of the Public Health Act, 1875. 
Also, if the Medical Officer of Health or Inspector of Nuisances 
certifies that it is necessary for the health of the persons 
employed that a workshop, or any part of a workshop, should 
be limewashed, cleansed or purified, the District Council may 
give notice to the owner or occupier to do the work in a time 
specified in the notice: in default he will be liable to a 
penalty of 10s. per day during which default continues, and 
the Council may do the work and recover the cost in a 
summary manner. 
Q.—State the law with regard to air-space in workshops and 
workplaces. 
A.—Sections 2 and 3 of the Act provide that workshops and 
workplaces must not be overcrowded while work is carried 
on so as to be dangerous or injurious to the health of the 
persons employed, and a workshop or workplace which is 
overcrowded may be dealt with as a nuisance under section 
91 of the Public Health Act, 1875. - 
Note—A workshop is deemed to be overcrowded if less 
than 250 cubic feet of air space (or during overtime 400) is 
allowed for each person in the room, and the Act requires a 
notice to be affixed in the workshop stating the number of 
persons who may be employed in each rcom of the work- 
shop. 
Q.—What is stated in the Act with regard to ventilation in 
workshops and workplaces ? 
A,—Sections 2 and 7 of the Act deal with ventilation and 
provide that “Every workshop and workplace must be 
ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, as far as 
practicable, any gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities 
generated in the course of the work that are a nuisance or 
injurious to health. Any workshop or workplace not so 
ventilated may be dealt with as a nuisance under section 91 
of the Public Health Act, 1875. This general provision is 
supplemented in the case of workshops by a special require- 
ment in the 1901 Act, that in every room in a workshop 
sufficient means of ventilation must be provided and sufficient
-P-A-G-E-113
102 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
ventilation maintained ; and where a standard of ventilation 
has been prescribed by the Secretary of State (as he has now 
power to do) for any class of workshops, that standard must 
be observed. Workshops where men only are employed are 
excluded from this requirement. Any workshop where 
this requirement is contravened may be dealt with as a 
nuisance. 
9 Q.—What is stated in the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, 
with reference to the drainage of floors of workshops? 
A.—Section 8 of the Act requires that in every workshop, or 
part of a workshop, in which any process is carried on, which 
renders the floor liable to be wet to such an extent that the 
wet is capable of being removed by drainage, adequate means 
shall be provided for draining off the wet. A workshop not 
so drained may be dealt with as a nuisance under section 91 
of the Public Health Act, 1875. This provision, however, 
does not apply to workshops in which men only are 
employed. 
10 Q—Does the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, repeal all 
previous Factory Acts ? 
A,—All except sections 8, 9, 10, 12 and the First Schedule 
of the 1891 Act; also section 12, subsection 3 of section 
24, and section 28 of the 1896 Act; but all these can be 
repealed from a date to be fixed by order of the Secretary of 
State. 
11 Q.—Do bakehouses come under the control of the District 
Councils? If so, what powers have they in regard to the 
same ? 
A,—Bakehouses are either factories or workshops within the 
meaning of the Act, according as mechanical power is, or is 
not, used in aid of the processes carried on. They are 
therefore subject to the general provisions of the Act, and 
the same powers will be exercised by District Councils in 
regard to bakehouses that are exercised by them in regard 
to factories and workshops. A general power is also given 
(by section 98) to the Council in the case of any bakehouse 
which is in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit 
for use or occupation as a bakehouse, to bring the case before 
a court of summary jurisdiction ; and the court may there- 
upon impose a fine and order means to be adopted to remove 
grounds of complaint.
-P-A-G-E-114
FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACT, ETC. 103 
In addition to the general regulations of the Act special 
sanitary regulations for bakehouses are contained in the 
Act. 
12 Q.—Give the substance of the special sanitary regulations for 
bakehouses contained in the Factory and Workshops Act 
1901. . 
A,—Section 97 requires that: A bakehouse must not contain, 
or communicate directly. with, a water-closet, earth-closet, 
privy, or ashpit; a cistern supplying water to a bakehouse 
must be separate from any cistern supplying water to a 
water-closet ; and a sewage pipe or drain must not have any 
opening in the bakehouse. Section 99 requires: All inside 
walls and ceilings of rooms and all passages and staircases to 
be limewashed every six months; or coated with three coats 
of paint (or varnish) every seven years, and washed with hot 
water and soap every six months. Section 100 requires 
that: Places on the same level with a bakehouse and forming 
part of the same building must not be used as sleeping- 
y laces, unless effectually separated from the bakehouse by a 
partition from floor to ceiling, and provided with an external 
glazed window of at least 9 square feet in area, of which 
44 feet must be made to open for ventilation. 
13 Q.—Have District Councils any powers for controlling the 
conditions under which work is done in the homes of the 
workers ? 
A,—Yes; important powers of controlling the conditions 
under which certain classes of work are done in the homes 
of the workers are given for the first time to the District 
Councils by the 1901 Act. These powers aim at the preven- 
tion of home work being done; (1) in dwellings which are 
injurious or dangerous to the health of the workers them- 
selves, e.g.; through overcrowding, want of ventilation, or 
other insanitary conditions; (2) in premises where there is 
dangerous infectious disease. 
‘14 Q.—What does the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, say 
about underground bakehouses ? 
A,—The Act provides generally that no underground bake- 
houses (whether factory or workshop) shall be used as such 
unless it was so used on August 17th, 1901; and after January 
1904, it shall not be lawful to use any underground bakehouse 
(whenever established) unless the Council are satisfied that
-P-A-G-E-115
104 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
it is suitable for the purpose, in regard to construction, 
light, ventilation, and in all other respects, and have given a certificate of suitability. 
15 Q.—Define the term “ Underground Bakehouses.” 
4l.—Section 101 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, 
defines an underground bakehouse as a bakehouse in which 
the baking-room, or any room used for any process incidental 
thereto, is so situated that the surface of the floor is more 
than 3 feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining 
street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. 
16 Q.—How is a District Council to be kept informed of the 
places where home work is being carried on? Give a form 
for a page in the register for such places. 
A.—(a) Occupiers of factories, workshops, or any place from 
which work is given out, and contractors employed by such 
occupiers, are required, in regard to such classes of work as 
may be fixed by the Secretary of State, to keep lists showing 
the names and addresses of all persons employed by them, 
either as workmen or as contractors outside such factory, 
workshop or place, and the place where they are employed, 
and to send to the Council twice a year (viz., on or before 
February 1st and August 1st) copies of such lists. The form 
in which such list is to be kept is prescribed by the Secretary 
of State in his Home Work Order of December 11th, 1901; 
these forms may be obtained from the Government printers.

districts, and which to both. 
A,.—(a) All, except sections 3, 7, 8, and 9 of the Housing of 
the Working Classes Act of 1885. 
(6) Part 1 deals with unhealthy areas, and applies only to 
Urban Authorities. 
Part 2 deals with unhealthy dwelling-houses, and applies 
to both Urban and Rural Sanitary Authorities. 
Part 8 deals with working-classes lodging-houses, and 
applies to both Urban and Rural Authorities, but requires 
adoption. 
Part 4 deals with limits of area, conditions of letting 
houses, compensation to tenants for expulsion, or removal, 
&e.: this part is supplemental. 
Part 5, Application of the Act to Scotland. 
Part 6, Application of the Act to Ireland. 
Part 7 repeals similar Acts, and contains temporary pro 
visions, 
18 Q.—State what powers an Urban Sanitary Authority have for 
effecting the general sanitary improvement of their district. 
A.—They have power under Part 1 of the Housing of the 
Working Classes Act, 1890, to deal with unhealthy areas, 
and for that purpose they shall consider an official repre- 
sentation that any houses, streets, &c., within a certain area 
are unfit for human habitation, or that their sanitary con- 
ditions, want of air or light or other defects, are such as to 
be “injurious to the bealth of the inhabitants of these or 
of other houses,” and cannot be remedied except by the 
“rearrangement or reconstruction of the houses,” and “if 
satisfied as to the truth thereof” and “ of the sufficiency of 
their resources,” shall forthwith make a scheme for the 
improvement of such area or areas, 
19 Q.—Define the terms “ official representation,” “ obstructive 
building,” “street,” and “lodging-houses for the working 
classes,” as used in the Houses of the Working Classes Act, 
1890. 
A,—* Official Representation” is the report of the Medical 
Officer of Health that he must make when he finds that in a 
certain area there are only (a) houses and courts unfit for 
habitation, and (4) defects of ventilation, houses too closely 
grouped ; and, further, that nothing short of an improve- 
ment scheme will remedy this condition. “ Obstructive
-P-A-G-E-117

building ” is a building, though not in itself unfit for habita- 
tion or dangerous to health, (a) rendering others so by stop- 
ping access of light or air or otherwise, or (6) preventing the 
removal of such defects therein. “Street” includes any 
court, alley, street, square, or row of houses. ‘ Lodging- 
houses for the working classes” includes separate houses 
for the working classes, whether containing one or several 
tenements; and “Cottages” includes gardens belonging 
thereto not exceeding half an acre in extent, or £3 in 
annual value. 
Q.—If any dwelling-house appears to the Local Authority to 
be unfit for human habitation, what steps should be taken 
with a view to closing the premises ? 
A.—Section 32 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act 
1890 says: It shall be the duty of every Local Authority to 
inspect their district from time to time (or cause it to be 
inspected); and, if any house is found unfit for human habi- 
tation, forthwith to proceed against the owner or occupier 
for its closure, whether it be occupied or not; the Court 
may impose a penalty not exceeding £20 and make a closing 
order; and, the closing order having been made, the Local 
Authority shall serve on every occupier, or tenant, notice to 
quit within a period of not less than seven days; in default 
they shall bo liable to a daily penalty not exceeding £1. 
Q.— Under what circumstances can a Local Authority demolish 
premises ? 
A.—If the’ closing order is not complied with, and the 
premises not remedied, the Local Authority may pass a reso- 
lution that it is necessary to demolish the building or build- 
ings, and notice shall be served on the owner to that effect ; 
they shall still further consider it and forward copies of the 
report and resolution to the owner, appointing a time and 
place for hearing his objections; after which they shall 
either allow his objections, or make an order for demolition, 
subject to appeal. 
Q.—Whiat is the condition to be implied on letting houses for 
the working classes? Are the Local Authority, in carrying 
out an improvement scheme, bound to provide other accom- 
modation for any of the working-class population displaced 2 
A.—(a) Section 75 of the Housing of the Working Classes 
Act, 1890, says: In any contract made after August 14,
-P-A-G-E-118
FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACT, ETC. 107 
1885, for letting a house, or part of a house, for habitation 
by persons of the working classes, it shall be an implied con- 
dition that such house is then in all respects reasonably fit 
for human habitation. 
(8) In London, yes; in the provinces, only when obliga- 
tions are imposed by the confirming authority (Local 
Government Board). 
23 Q.—Name the object and briefly outline the main provisions 
of the Shop Hours Act, 1892. 
A,—The ebject is to limit the number of hours which a young 
person shall be employed, in or about any shop, to 74 hours 
in one week including meal times. And a notice to this 
effect shall be képt exhibited in a conspicuous place. 
Note.—No penalty was provided for, in default, so a short 
Act of two sections only, called the Shop Hours Act, 1895, 
had to be passed, stating that the penalty was a sum not 
exceeding £2. 
24 Q.—Does the Shop Hours Act, 1892, apply to all shops? 
Define the term “shop” and ‘young person,” and state how 
Inspectors under this Act are appointed. 
A,—(a) Yes (unless the context requires otherwise). 
(8) “Shop” means retail and wholesale shops, markets, 
stalls, and warehouses in which assistants are employed for 
hire, and includes public houses and refreshment houses of 
any kind. “ Young person” means a person under the age 
of eighteen years, 
(ce) The Council of any county or borough may appoint 
such Inspectors as they think necessary for the execution of 
this Act in their district, and sections 68 and 70 of the 
Factories and Workshops Act, 1878, shall apply in the case 
of any such officer, as if he were appointed under that Act.

LESSON XI 
THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1875-1892, 
AND THE MARGARINE ACT, 1887. 
1 Q.—What is the object of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 
1875, and also state why the amending Act of 1879 was 
passed ? 
A.—(a) The object of this Act is to forbid any person to mix 
colour, stain or powder, or cause or permit so to mix, &e., 
any article of food so as to render it injurious to health, with 
intent that it shall be sold in that state; or to sell such 
article of food, under a penalty not exceeding £50 for a first 
offence, and, on a subsequent conviction of imprisonment 
with hard labour for a period not exceeding six months. 
Section 3 and section 6 provide that no person shall sell any 
food or drug which is not of the nature, substance, and 
quality demanded, under a penalty not exceeding £20, except 
when the addition so made is not intended fraudulently to 
increase its bulk, weight, d&c., or to conceal its inferior 
quality. “The Act also provides for the Local Authority 
appointing Inspectors to take samples of food and drugs, and 
an analyst to analyse the samples, with a view to taking 
proceedings and obtaining the conviction of the offenders. 
(b) The 1879 Act was passed to settle or explain certain 
sections that were not sufficiently explicit in the 1875 Act; 
as, that it shall be no defence to allege that the purchaser, 
having bought for analysis only, was therefore not prejudiced 
by the sale. Also, that the article need not be deficient in 
all three respects (nature, substance, and quality); any one 
is sufficient. Also, that a sample of milk may be taken “‘at 
the place of delivery,” 7.¢., in the street or railway station as 
well as in the shop. It also provides that the minimum 
strength of brandy, whisky, and rum, be twenty-five

degrees under proof, and of gin thirty-five degrees under 
proof. ‘ 
2 Q.—Define “food ” and “ drug” according to the Sale of Food 
and Drugs Acts. 
A.—The definition of the word “food” in the 1875 Act is 
repealed, and is now defined by section 26 of the Sale of 
Food and Drugs Act, 1899, as follows: “ Food shall include 
every article used for food or drink by man, other than drugs 
and water, as well as any article which ordinarily enters into, 
or, is used in, the composition or preparation of human food; 
and shall also include flavouring matters and condiments.” 
“ Drug ” is defined as including medicines for external, as well 
as internal use. 
3 Q.—Give the nature of the four saving’ clauses specified in 
Section 6 of the 1875 Act. 
A,—(1) Non-injurious substance added, required for its 
preparation as an article of commerce, and not fraudulently to 
increase its weight, bulk, cc. ; or, (2) it is a proprietary 
medicine ; the subject of a patent, or corresponds with the 
specification ; or (3) is “ compounded ” as herein mentioned ; 
or (4) when the extraneous material is an unavoidable ad- 
mixture in the process of collection or preparation. 
4 Q.—Who may obtain samples of foods and drugs for analysis? 
In purchasing samples for analysis may an assistant act ? 
A.—({a) The Medical Officer of Health, Inspector, constable or 
Inspector of Weights and Measures charged with the execu- 
tion of this Act. 
Note—This means that a special appointment is necessary 
to take samples, and that the Inspector should carry upon 
him a copy of the resolution of the authority appointing 
him under their seal. 
(6) Yes, any person over fourteen years of age may ask 
for the sample, but the Inspector should be at hand, take 
the sample, pay for same, and offer to divide, &c., as per the 
following answer. 
5 Q.—State clearly what must be done by the purchaser of any 
food.or drug obtained for analysis. 
4,—Section 14 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, says 
that: “The purchaser, after completing the purchase, must 
inform the seller of his intention to have the sample analysed
-P-A-G-E-121
by the public analyst, and at once (offer to) divide it into three parts, to be then and there separated, each part to be 
marked and sealed or fastened up, and shall, if required ‘to 
do so (proceed accordingly and shall), deliver one of the 
parts to the seller, retain one himself, and deliver or forward d 
the third part to the public analyst.

6 Q.—Suppose the seller refuses the offer of the inspector to 
divide the sample in his presence, or to accept one part of the | 
sample, what is then the duty of the Inspector ? ‘ 
A.—Section 15 of the 1875 Act which provided for this, by | 
allowing the Inspector in such a case to forward the whole | 
sample to the public analyst, for him to divide it into two 
parts and let the Inspector have one part (for future refer- { 
ence, if necessary) is now repealed by the 1899 Act, so that Q 
the Inspector must divide it into three parts, and leave one 
with the seller (see also the previous answer). 
7 Q.—Can an Inspector send samples by post to the public 
analyst, and, is there a distance limit ? 
A,—(a) and (6) Yes; section 16 of the Act says: “If the 
analyst resides beyond two miles, the sample may be sent 
by post as a registered letter or parcel.” 
Note—The 1899 Act, section 15, repeals the words 
“ Registered Letter,” and substitutes the words “ Registered 
Parcel.” 
8 Q.—Is there any limit of time fixed in which action against any 
person under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act can be 
taken ? . 
A.—Yes; section 19 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 
1899, provides that when any article of food or drug has been 
purchased from any person for test purposes, any prosecution 
under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act in respect of the 
sale thereof, notwithstanding anything contained in section 20 
of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, shall not be 
instituted after the expiration of twenty-eight days from the 
time of the purchase. And—in any prosecution under the 
Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, the summons shall state 
particulars of the offence, or offences, alleged, also the name 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, ETC. 111 
of the prosecutor, and shall not be made returnable in less 
time than fourteen days from the day on which it is served, 
and there must be served therewith a copy of the analyst’s 
certificate obtained on behalf of the prosecutor. 
9 Q.—Is the Inspector entitled to obtain milk in course of 
delivery, and is it necessary in such a case for the officer to 
divide the sample into three parts? 
A.—(a) Yes; see answer to No. 1 question in this lesson 
(section 3 of the 1879 Act). 
(b) No; it is not necessary for him to divide the sample 
into three parts. Before the 1899 Act was passed the 
Inspector was required to seal it up and deliver or forward 
it whole to the analyst, but by section 10 of the 1899 Act, if 
the name and address of the consignor appears on the can, 
he shall forward a portion of the sample by registered parcel, 
or otherwise, to him, This in my opinion applies when the 
sample is taken in the railway station, &c., and there is no 
one in charge of the milk; but if the same is taken in the 
street from a farmer or dairyman delivering same, the 
sample should be divided into three parts, afis usual with 
other samples, 
10 Q.—Is it compulsory to have name and address inscribed on 
the cart or can when selling milk in a public place? 
A.—Yes; section 9 of the 1899 Act says: “ Every person 
who, himself or by his servant, in any highway or place of 
public resort, sells milk or cream from a vehicle, or from a 
can or other receptacle, shall have conspicuously inscribed on 
the vehicle or receptacle his name and address, and in 
default shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not 
exceeding £2.” 
11 Q.—Under what Act and section should action be taken 
against any one for selling skimmed milk for pure milk ? 
A.—Section 9 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. In 
this section it is forbidden to sell any article from which some 
part has been abstracted, without notice to the buyer. 
12 Q.~As Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, you 
are well known to the local tradesmen. State the pre-
-P-A-G-E-123
112 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
cautions you would take in collecting samples to prevent the 
vendors being on their guard. 
A,—See answer to No. 4 question; employ an assistant, any- 
one over fourteen years of age; but the Inspector must be at 
hand to take and pay for the sample (although it is quite as 
legal, I believe, and often done, to allow the assistant to pay 
for it) and must take it from him (or her) before he (or she) 
leave the shop, inform the seller that it is to be analysed, 
and divide it, &c., as per answer No, 5. 
18 Q.—A milk-seller in a town receives all his milk by rail from 
a farmer in the country. Explain clearly what steps the 
Inspector of Nuisances can take, in order to determine 
whether the milk is adulterated ; and, if adulterated, who is 
responsible ? 
A.—(a) The Inspector of Nuisances, as such, has no power, 
but if he happens to hold the appointment of Food and 
Drugs Inspector he may take a sample of milk from the cans 
in the railway station as soon as they arrive. He must 
demand the sample from the railway official in charge, and 
have him (if possible) as a useful witness in case of a prose- 
cution. The milk should be well mixed before taking a 
sample, to distribute the cream throughout. 
(6) Ifthe milk is found adulterated, and the dealer has no 
warranty from the farmer, he is responsible; but if he has 
a warranty from the farmer, the latter is responsible. 
14 Q.—Is it an offence to refuse to sell an article required by an 
Inspector for analysis ? . 
A.—Yes ; section 4 of the 1879 Act provides for a penalty 
not exceeding £10 for refusing to sell. 
15 Q.--Under what sections of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 
should an Inspector proceed in the cases of adulteration 
(a) alum in bread ; (6) spirits of nitre diluted with water 
(c) whisky thirty-five degrees under proof ? 
A.—(a) Section 6 of the 1875 Act, or if there is much alum 
in the bread, action could be taken under section 3 of the 
1875 Act, as it could be proved to be injurious to health. 
(6) Section 6 of the 1875 Act also covers this, as it would 
be not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded. 
(c) Section 6 of the 1879 Act provides for this, as whisky, 
rum and brandy must not be more than twenty-five, and
-P-A-G-E-124
THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, ETC. 113 
gin thirty-five degrees under proof. (See answer to question 
No. 1.) - 
16 Q.—What is the penalty for wilfully obstructing or impeding 
an Inspector in, or attempting to prevent him by bribe or 
promise from, carrying out his duty under the Sale of Food 
and Drugs Acts ? : 
A.—Section 16 of the.1899 Act says: “ Any person who wil- 
fully obstructs or impedes any Inspector, or other officer, in 
the course of his duties under the Sale of Food and Drugs 
Acts; or, by any gratuity, bribe, promise or other induce- 
ment, prevents, or attempts to prevent, the due execution 
by such Inspector, or other officer, of his duty under those 
Acts, shall be liable, on summary conviction, for the first 
offence to a fine not exceeding £20, for the second offence to 
a fine not exceeding £50, and for any subsequent offence to 
a fine not exceding £100. 
17 Q.—What is stated regarding tinned, skimmed or separated 
milk ? : 
A,—Section 11 of the 1899 Act says: “ Every tin or other 
receptacle, containing condensed, separated or skimmed milk, 
must bear a label, clearly visible to the purchaser, on which 
the words ‘Machine-skimmed Milk,’ or ‘Skimmed Milk’ 
as the case may require, are printed in large and legible type, 
and if any person sells or exposes, or offers for sale, con- 
densed, separated or skimmed, milk, in contravention of this 
section, he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not 
exceeding £10. 
18 Q.—Define “ Butter,” ‘‘ Margarine,” “ Cheese,” and “ Marga- 
rine Cheese,” under the Margarine Act of 1887 and the 
Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899. 
A,—* Butter” is the substance usually known as butter, made 
exclusively from milk or cream, or both, with, or without, 
salt, or other preservative, and with, or without, the addition 
of colouring-matter. “Margarine” includes all substances, 
whether compounds or otherwise, prepared in imitation of 
butter, and whether mixed with butter or not; these two 
are defined by the Margarine Act, 1887. “Cheese” is 
defined by the Sale of Food and Drugs Act as the sub- 
stance usually known as cheese, containing no fat derived 
otherwise than from milk, ‘“ Margarine Cheese” is defined 
~ : H
-P-A-G-E-125
114 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
by the same Act, as any substance, whether compound or 
otherwise, which is prepared in imitation of cheese, and 
which contains fat not derived from milk. 
19 Q.-~What does the Margarine Act of 1887 specify respecting 
the marking or labelling of packages of margarine? and 
does the Sale of Foodand Drugs Act, 1899, extend the Mar- 
garine Act ? 
4.—(a) By the former Act, every package, whether open or 
closed, containing margarine, shall be branded, or durably 
marked “ Margarine ” on the top, bottom and sides in printed 
capital letters not less than } of an inch square, and, if ex- 
posed for sale by retail, each parcel shall have attached a label 
marked in printed capital letters ‘‘ Margarine,” in 14-inch 
square letters, and, when selling it, the wrapper shall be 
marked “ Margarine” in quarter-inch square letters. 
(2) Yes; by the 1899 Act the above provisions as to 
marking, &e., shall apply to margarine-cheese also. This 
Act also amends the former Act, by requiring the package 
to be marked or branded, on the package itself, and not 
solely on a label, ticket, or other thing attached thereto. 
Also the letters required to be printed on the paper wrapper 
in which margarine or margarine-cheese is sold must be 
(capital block letters) not less than 4 an inch long, distinctly 
legible, and no other printed matter shall appear on the 
wrapper. 
20 Q.—What would be a good defence for any one charged with 
selling margarine for butter? Also, has the 1899 Act 
amended the sections in the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 
1875, and the Margarine Act, as to a warranty or invoice 
being available for defence in any proceedings under these 
Acts ? 
A,—(a) There is a saving clause in the Margarine Act, 1887, 
algo in the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, namely: that 
tha vendor be absolved if he proves that he bought the article 
with a written warranty, and sold it in the same state as 
when he bought it, believing it to be butter, &c. 
(8) Yes; section 20 of the 1899 Act says: “A warranty 
or invoice shall not be available as a defence to any pro- 
ceeding under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, unless the 
defendant has, within seven days after service of the sum- 
mons, sent to the purchaser a copy of such warranty or 
invoice, with a written notice stating that he intends to rely 
me
-P-A-G-E-126
THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, ETC. 115 
on the warranty or invoice, and specifying the name and 
address of the person from whom he received it, and has also 
sent a like notice of his intention to such person, The person 
by whom such warranty or invoice is alleged to have been 
given shall be entitled to appear at the hearing and to give 
evidence; the court may, if it thinks fit, adjourn the hearing 
to enable him to do so,” 
21 Q.—In taking a sample of butter for analysis, is the Inspector 
required to go through the form of purchase prescribed by 
the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875? 
A.—No; section 10 of the Margarine Act, 1887, says: 
“ Officers authorised to take samples under the Sale of Food 
and Drugs Acts may take samples of butter (or substances 
purporting to be butter, exposed for sale, and not marked as 
Margarine) without going through the form of purchase 
required by that Act, but otherwise complying with its pro- 
visions as to dealing with the samples.” 
22 Q.—Is an occupier of a manufactory of margarine or mar- 
garine-cheese required to be registered? Give a copy of a 
label suitable to attach to samples of food or drugs. 
A—(a) Yes. All margarine factories are required to be 
registered with the Sanitary Authority by whom the analyst 
isappointed. The Margarine Act, 1887, and the Sale of Food 
and Drugs Act, 1889, extend this to cover margarine-cheese. 
This later Act also makes it compulsory for the occupiers of 
wholesale manufactories of margarine and margarine-cheese 
to keep a register, and it imposes a penalty not exceeding 
£10 for a first offence, and not exceeding £50 for a sub- 
sequent offence, for failing to (a) keep such a register; 
(8) refusing to produce such register when required by officer 
of Local Government Board; (c) failing to keep it up to 
date ; (d) wilfully making a false entry in such register ; _e) 
fraudulently omitting to enter any particular which ought 
to be entered in such register.

tion Act, 1889? State where horseflesh may be legally sold, 
and what signs on such shops are necessary ? 
A,.—(a) To prevent the sale of horseflesh, &., except in places 
properly labelled for such, and to prevent the sale of horse- 
flesh when other meat is asked for. It also gives power to 
the Medical Officer of Health, and the Inspector of Nuisances 
to inspect such places, 
(8) The letters over the shop or stall where it is sold must 
be at least 4 inches long, to the effect that horseflesh is 
sold. 
2 Q.—Define “ Horseflesh ” according to the Act, and also state 
whether it would be an offence to sell horseflesh as beef.

bination with any other substance. 
(0) Yes. 
3 Q.—What is the object of the Rivers’ Pollution Prevention 
Act, 18762 State briefly its chief provisions. 
A.—(a) The object is to prevent pollution and the establish- 
ment of new sources of pollution. :
-P-A-G-E-129
118 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
(0) The chief provisions are: (Section 2) no solid refuse 
of any kind must be put into any stream so as to interfere 
with its due flow or to pollute its waters; (Section 3) no 
solid or liquid sewage matter must be passed into any stream ; 
(Section 4) no poisonous, noxious, or polluting liquid from 
any factory or manufacturing process, must be passed into 
any stream; (Section 5) no solid matter from mines must be 
put into any stream, so as to prejudicially affect its flow ; 
nor must any poisonous, noxious, or polluting solid or liquid 
matter from mines be passed into any stream, other than 
water in the sume condition in which it has been raised or 
drained from such mines. 
4 Q.~—Name the chief saving clauses of Rivers’ Pollution Pre- 
vention Act, 1876; and define the terms “ Stream,” “Solid 
matter,” and “ Polluting,” as used therein. 
A,—(a) In section 3, re “polluting by sewage matter,” the 
following saving clause occurs: “but as regards conditions 
in existence prior to 1876, no offence is committed under this 
Act if it is shown, that the best practicable and available 
means are being used to render harmless the sewage entering 
the stream”; this saving clause is repeated in section 4 as to 
polluting liquid from factories. 
(8) “Stream ” includes the sea as far as the Local Govern- 
ment Board may determine. ‘Solid matter” does not 
include suspended particles. “ Polluting” does not include 
innocuous discolouration. 
5 Q. What is the object of the Rivers’ Pollution Prevention 
‘Act, 1893? State briefly the provisions of section 1. 
A.—A short Act was passed in 1893 to explain or remove a 
technical difficulty likely to be raised by Sanitary Authorities 
seeking to evade their responsibilities under section 3 of the 
1876 Act; as by saying they did not know; section 1 of the 
1893 Act says: “They shall be held to knowingly pass the 
sewage into a stream where it is permitted so to pass along 
their sewers or channels.” 
6 Q.— What other Acts deal with the polluting of streams, in 
addition to the Rivers’ Pollution Prevention Acts of 1876

A.—Section 17 of the Public Health Act, 1875, provides for 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
SALE OF HORSEFLESH REGULATION ACT, ETC. 119 
Local Authorities purifying sewage before discharging it into 
any natural stream or watercourse, and section 68 provides 
against fouling of streams with gas-washings or other sub- 
stances used in making or supplying gus. In the Public 
Health (Amendment) Act, 1890, section 47, it is forbidden to 
throw or place in any river or watercourse, any cinders, 
ashes, bricks, stones, dust, rubbish, filth, or other matters 
which are likely to cause annoyance. 
Note.—This Act is adoptive. 
7 Q—wWhat do the Canal Boat Acts, 1877 and 1884, state 
respecting the registration, lettering, marking, and number- 
ing of canal boats ? 
A.—Section 1 of the 1877 Act says: ‘‘ No canal boat shall be 
used as a dwelling unless it is registered, and then only by 
the number of persons of the age and sex for which it is 
registered.” It must be registered by a Sanitary Authority 
whose district abuts upon the canal on which the boat is 
intended to ply, and which is also within a school district. 
Section 7 and section 1 of the 1884 Act, says: ‘Certificate of 
registration ceases to be of force, in the event of any 
structural alterations affecting conditions on which it was 
granted.” Section 2 of the 1877 Act, directs the Local 
Government Board to make regulations for the registration, 
lettering, marking and numbering of canal boats, and section 
| 8 says: Every registered boxt must have painted upon it the 
registered number, the place to which it belongs, and the 
} word ‘“ Registered”; and Section 6 of the 1884 Act adds 
that a boat must be lettered, marked and numbered in a 
conspicuous position on both sides, or on the stern, so as to 
be clearly seen from either bank. oe 
8 Q.—State the purposes for which regulations have been made 
by the Local Government Board under section 2 of the Canal 
Boats Act, 1877, 
A,.—For fixing the number, age and sex of persons who may 
be allowed to occupy or dwell in a canal boat, having regard 
to cubic space, ventilation and general accommodation. For 
promoting cleanliness and habitable condition of such boats, 
and for preventing the spread of infectious disease. (Also

Authority of the place of destination. 
11 Q.—May an Inspector of Nuisances be requested by a Local 
Authority to act as their officer, under the Contagious Diseases 
(Animals) Act ? 
A,—Yes. (See the Local Government Board Order of March 23, 
1891, clause 14, in answer to question 2, Lesson VII.) 
12 Q.—Define “disease” according to the Contagious Diseases 
(Animals) Act.

16 Q.—Is it necessary for all dairymen, cowkeepers, and sellers 
of milk to be registered ? 
A,—Yes, as section 6 of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milk- 
shops Order of 1885 says: ‘It shall not be lawful for any 
person to carry on in the district of any Local Authority the 
trade of cowkeeper, dairyman, or purveyor of milk unless he 
is registered as such therein, in accordance with this 
Article.” . : 
Note.—A. person who sells milk from his own cows in 
swmall quantities to his workmen or neighbours for their 
accommodation need not be registered. 
  17 Q.—What provisions are contained in the Dairies, Cowsheds 
and Milkshops Order, 1885, to prevent contamination of 
milk by infectious disease ? 
A,—Section 9 of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 
1885, says: “It shall not be lawful to allow any person 
suffering from a dangerous infectious disorder, or having 
recently been in contact with a person so suffering, to milk 
cows or to handle vessels used for containing milk for sale, 
or in any way to take part or assist in the conduct of the 
trade or business of cowkeeper, dairyman, purveyor of milk 
or occupier of a milk-store or milkshop, so far as regards the

is a model bylaw ; and what are the main points 
‘ved in the making and confirming of bylaws ? 
nodel bylaw is a bylaw made by the Local Govern- 
ed for the guidance of Sanitary Authorities in 
laws. 
(6) When bylaws are made by a Local Authovity, (1) they 
must be under the common seal of the Local Authority ; (2) 
they must be reasonable ; (3) they may be altered or repealed 
by a subsequent bylaw; (4) they must be confirmed by the 
Local Government Board, and (a) notice be given in local 
newspapers, or by handbills, or otherwise, for one month, 
and (0) provision made for supplying ratepapers with a copy 
(6d. per hundred words may be charged), (5) they must be

accessible to ratepayers at reasonable times. 
2 Q.—What is the difference between a bylaw and a regula- 
tion 2 
A,—A bylaw requires the approval or confirmation of the 
Local Government Board, but a regulation does not. Regu- 
lations are usually made under an Act of Parliament, such 
as the Public Health Act, 1875, or some local act. Regula- 
tions may also be made under the Dairies, Cowsheds and 
Miikshops Order, 1885,

into the external air, in such a manner and at such a height, 
as to admit of its diffusion without noxious or injurious 
effects, or shall cause the vapour to pass over the fire, or into 
a suitable condensing apparatus, or both, so as effectually to 
consume the vapour, or to deprive the same of all noxious or 
injurious properties. 
Note.—This bylaw also applies to the following offensive 
trades: blood-drier, bone-boiler, soap-boiler, tallow-melter,

extractor; the premises of the tripe-boiler and gut-scraper 
should be limewashed four times per year ; those of glue- 
maker and size-maker once in every year; while the model 
bylaws do not ask for the premises of the blood-boiler, blood- 
drier and bone-boiler to be limewashed at all; no doubt any 
Local Authority adopting the bylaws would make the by- 
law for limewashing apply to all the trades.

ensue in every case where the pleura have been stripped. 
5 Q.—How may a Rural Authority acquire the powers of an 
Urban Authority under'the Public Health Act, 1875 2 
A,—Section 276 of the Public Health Act, 1875, empowers the 
Local Government Board to grant conditionally, or uncon- 
ditionally, on the request of a Rural Authority or of the 
ratepayers representing one-tenth of the rateable value, all or 
any of the powers of an Urban Authority for the district or

A,—Find the number of cubic inches in the cistern ; this is 
found by multiplying the measurements together, and the 
result by 1728, which is the number of cubic inches in one - 
eubic foot, as follows: 5 x 4 = 20 x 3-5 =70 eubie feet x 1728

number of cubic inches flowing into the cistern per second. 
This is found by multiplying the rate of flow, or velocity, by 
the area of the pipe, as follows :—Area of pipe = ‘7854 of an 
inch x 86 (inches per second) = 28°2744 cubié-inches per 
second entering cistern. Divide the 120,960 by 28-2744

14 Q.—A well is suspected of being polluted by leakage from a 
drain which passes within 10 feet of it. Explain exactly, 
_ step by step, the kind and method of the investigations you 
would make in order to ascertain whether the well water is 
receiving pollution. 
A,—If possible, I should prove first whether the drain was 
leaking or not, by stopping up the outlet and filling with 
water to the highest gully, or test the length running past 
the well. If the drain was water-tight the pollution must be 
looked for from some other source, and if not water-tight, it 
should be taken up and made so, by relaying if necessary. 
15 Q.—Give your views as to the way to ensure the effective 
scavenging of a main thoroughfare in a large town, the road 
being asphalted or wood-paved. 
A.—Hold some one responsible (a good foreman) for seeing 
the work done; the roadway should be gone over in the 
early morning with the horse broom before the business of 
the day has begun. The watering-cart should precede the 
broom, if the weather is dry, to keep down the dust. A large 
staff of good men with brooms and shovels, and plenty of 
horses and carts, should be at hand to sweep the dust and 
refuse into heaps and shovel it into the carts. It would also 
be advisable, to prevent the roadway getting greasy, to well 
flush or wash the pavement occasionally by means of hose- 
pipes connected to the street hydrants, one man with a hose-

with brooms sweeping the water and dirt in front of them. 
Of course the gulleys would catch a lot of this, and would 
require emptying out as soon after as possible. 
16 Q.—Describe the method of disinfection which you would 
recommend during the illness of a patient with enteric 
(typhoid) fever; distinguish between houses which use (a) a 
pail closet, (b) a privy, and (c) a water-closet. . 
A.—In every case the excreta and all discharges from the 
bowels should be thoroughly disinfected before transferring 
them to the pail, privy, or w.c.; the best way to do this is 
to have some strong disinfectant in the vessel which receives 
the discharge direct from the bowels. A strong solution (1 in 
1000) of corrosive sublimate is best. The bowel discharge 
should be well mixed with the disinfectant by stirring or 
otherwise. 
(a) Where a pail is in use a separate pail should be pro- 
vided with an air-tight cover, the contents emptied regularly, 
and either burnt in a destructor, or buried a good depth and 
far away from houses or any source of water-supply. 
(6) Where a privy is in use this should be emptied fre- 
quently, and a disinfecting powder, such as carbolic acid 
powder, or chloride of lime, spread over it so as to cover it 
completely. It should be thoroughly emptied, cleansed, and 
disinfected on the recovery or removal of the patient. . 
(c) Where a water-closet is in use, after the contents are 
thoroughly mixed, it only remains to thoroughly flush the 
w.c. with water, to which could be added some more disin- 
fecting solution, 
17 Q.—A person who has purchased from a butcher's stall a pair

A,—Unless the Public Health (Amendment) Act of 1890 
has been adopted no action could be taken, except that I 
should at once visit the stall and make an inspection, to see 
if the butcher had any more diseased meat or flesh exposed, 
or intended for sale; if so, 1 should seize it and take it to a 
justice to be condemned, and then see it destroyed or buried, 
and report to the Sanitary Authority as given in answer 
to Question 1 in Lesson VI. If the Public Health (Amend- 
ment) Act, 1890, has been adopted, the butcher could be sum- 
. moned, even if the kidneys had not been seized as mentioned ~

8 Q.—Describe and sketch a good form of waste (or slop) water- 
closet. Also enumerate the advantages and disadvantages 
of this form of closet. 
A.—(a) Ducketts, of Burnley, make a good form of slop or 
waste water-closet (or tipper closet as they are often termed 
in the building trade). It consists of an oval pan or shaft 
which reaches from the seat down to the drain-trap which is 
connected to the sewer in the passage or street. The depth 
of the trap below the seat varies according to the distance of 
the drain below the surface. The oval pan is part of a large 
chamber which reaches ander the floor of the w.c., and at 
the opposite end is pivoted a tilting vessel or tipper, which 
holds from three to four gallons when full, The drains from 
the sink, bath and lavatory waste-pipes, also the roof and 
yard surface water, should all discharge over and into the 
tipper, which is so balanced that when nearly full it over- 
turns (or tips) and discharges its contents into the oval pan, 
which has an opening in the centre leading to the trap; an 
annular ring is so formed in the oval pan round the centre 
opening as to hold water.

No water rate and a great saving in the water-supply, as only 
waste water is used to flush these closets, The volume of 
sewage to be dealt with is considerably Jess than is the case 
where ordinary w.c.s are in use. No freezing in the winter 
time, with its expense and inconvenience. 
The disadvantages are few, and the only one of any weight 
is, that this closet is not so cleanly as the ordinary w.c., but 
for outdoor use this is not so important. 
Q,—What is the Plenum method of ventilation, and for what 
purpose would you consider it suitable? A chimney flue 
nominally 14 inches by 9 inkhes, plastered inside, has an 
upward current of 3 feet per second, what quantity of air 
will pass up itin one hour? 
A.—(a) The Plenum method of ventilation is the forcing or 
propulsion of air into a building, and is only suitable for 
public buildings, such as hospitals, &c. 
(6) First, find the area of the flue in square feet. 
In this case the 14 inches by 9 inches flue after plastering, 
may be taken as 13 inches by 8 inches to allow of half an 
inch of plastering (termed pargetting). 
This can be taken as approximately } of a square foot in 
area, thus :— 
13x 8=1043 the area of a square foot is 12x 12=144, 
three-fourths of which is 108, so that 104 can be taken as 
approximately } of a square foot. 
Then :— 
Area = ‘75 of a square foot, which multiplied by the 
velocity (in this case 3 feet per second) gives the cubic feet 
per second passing up the flue. 
Thus :—'75 x 8=2-25 cubic feet per second. 
and 2:25 x 60 =135 cubic feet per minute, 
and 135x60=8100 —,, > hour 
passing up the flue. 
Note-—No deduction is made for the 
roughness of the plaster, as the question 
says 3 feet per second ill pass up flue.

+ 20 Feet ~*~ the accompanying section, deducting 
Fre, 46. a centre pole 6 ins, diameter,
-P-A-G-E-158
MISCELLANEOUS 147 
A.—-We must first find the cubie contents of the bottom part 
which is circular on plan with a diameter of 20 feet, and a 
height of 3 feet; then 20x 20=400, and 400 x-‘7854= 
314:16 square feet (area of floor) Then 314:16 x 3= 942-48 
cubic feet in bottom portion of tent. Now, the upper part 
is a cone with a base 20 feet in diameter, and, to find its 
height, we must square the slant side, and from the result 
deduct half the diameter squared. Thus 20x 20=400 
(slant side squared) and 10x 10=100 (half the diameter 
squared). Then 400~100=300, and the square root of 
this =17°32 (approximately) which is the height of the 
cone required. The cubic contents of a cone equals the area 
of its base, multiplied by one-third the height; in this case 
one-third of 17°32 = 5-77 approximately, and 314-16, area of 
base, x 5°77 =1812-7 cubic feet, add the contents of both 
portions together, thus :—942-48 + 1812-7 = 2755°18 = total 
cubic contents of tent : from which we must deduct the tent- 
pole, which is 3 feet+17°32 feet long, or high = 20-32 feet, 
and which is 6 inches in diameter. The sectional area of 
tent-pole is then found in square feet, and multiplied by its 
height. As 6 inches="5 feet, then ‘5 feetx 5 feet=°25 
feet, this multiplied by +7854 = -196350 square foot = sectional 
area, This multiplied by the length in feet=+196350 by 
20°32=3°99 cubic feet (approximately) in the tent-pole. 
Now 275518 — 3:99 = 2751-19 cubic feet (answer). 
21 Q.—A village has to be scavenged on the “Conservancy” 
system. Describe in detail how you would arrange this, 
A.—Provide circular dust bins of galvanised iron, with loose 
covers or lids, one to every house, and sooner than that the 
larger houses, hotels, &c., should have very large bins, provide 
two smaller ones for them. Let a proper covered place or 
shed be erected in the yard to keep the bin under. Arrange- 
ments should be made to have all the bins emptied once per 
week; to do this, the village should be divided into districts, 
and one or more horses and carts told off to attend to each 
district along with the necessary number of men; a driver 
and two men to each horse and cart. The bins are emptied 
in the day time, the two men carrying them from the yards, 
and tipping the refuse into the carts. As privies are in my 
opinion better than pails, I should advise that one ashpit be 
erected to two privies, that it be in the centre, and provided 
with a grating on the top of which all ashes are placed and
-P-A-G-E-159
148 LESSONS IN SANITATION 
riddled ; the finer ashes that go through to be so distributed by 
sloping flags or stones as to fall on the excreta in both privies. 
The larger cinders can either be taken back into the house 
to burn again or be thrown into the bin. The privies should 
be emptied during the night through a door opening from 
the ashpit into the back street. Carts with collapsible 
covers, which form windguards when open, should be used 
for the dry ashes and refuse. HH no refuse destructor is pro- 
vided, the refuse from the bins should be tipped in hollow 
places in fields, &c., far removed from dwellings; the fine 
ashes and excreta can be sold or given to farmers for manure, 
or otherwise disposed of. 
22 Q.—What do you understand by superheated, and by saturated, 
steam? Also by the term “latent heat?” 
A,—(a) Saturated steam is water vapour at a temperature 
very slightly above that at which it has been generated, and, 
thus in such a state that it will condense immediately upon 
any article that is slightly colder than itself. If saturated 
steam is further heated a few degrees, the vapour partakes 
more of the physical character of a gas and becomes super- 
heated. . 
(6) Latent heat is given out when steam condenses into 
water, To make 1 lb. of boiling water into steam of the 
same temperature absorbs as much heat as would raise 963 lbs. 
of water one degree Fahr. in temperature, or 1 lb. of water 
968 degrees in temperature, and it is this heat which the 
steam gives out on condensing which is termed “latent 
eat,” 
23 Q.—What kind of a disinfector would you recommend for 
(a) a large manufacturing town; (6) a poor rural district? 
Give your reasons. 
A.— (a) There are several disinfectors which are suitable for 
large towns ; as, for instance, those made by Messrs. Goddard, 
Massey and Warner; and Manlove, Alliot and Co.; both 
these firms also make Washington Lyon’s type of disinfector. 
Also the Equifex Saturated Steam Disinfector. 
(®) For a poor rural (or small urban) district I should 
recommend a Thresh’s or Reck’s disinfector. 
(c) All the above are efficient disinfectors, and the only

VIVA-VOCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
_ 1 Q.—Do you know any simple method of testing cement ? 
A.—The best and simplest test for cement for drain-pipe 
joints is to mix some cement thin enough to pour into a 
bottle and allow it to set (say for twenty-four hours). If it 
expands it will have cracked the bottle, and if it shrinks it 
will rattle loosely in the bottle. The strength to a few 
pounds is not of so much importance for this purpose, as 
non-alterability in the volume of the cement; as, if it 
expands it will burst the sockets of the pipes; and if it 
contracts it allows the joints to leak, so that in either case 
the drain would not be water-tight even when newly laid, 
2 Q.—Why are pipes, &c., made shiny or glazed? - 
A.—To make them non-absorbent, that is, to prevent the 
sewage soaking into and through them. The glaze also 
increases the velocity of the sewage by lessening friction, 
thus preventing deposits. 
3 Q.—What kind of an article is this? (The examiner here 
showed to the candidate a small model of a wash-down closet

6 Q.—Would you pass that wall or building? (The examiner 
here produced a tracing showing a section of a wall without 
any damp-proof course.) 
A.—No; the wall requires a damp-proof course, and a dry 
area, or a cavity wall if the basement floor is below ground 
level. 
7 Q.—What are damp-proof courses for ? 
A.—To prevent the damp in the soil or ground rising up the 
walls into the rooms and to the floor timbers, 
8 Q.—What are they made of 2? 
A.—Lead, slates laid in cement mortar, asphalt, pitch and 
tar, several kinds of felt, &., also, ventilated stoneware 
slabs. . 
9 Q.—How would you test a new drain? 
A.—By the water test. 
10 Q.—An old drain ?

12 Q.—How would you test the quality of drain-pipes if you 
had to pass them ? 
4.—Examine them carefully to see that they were straight in 
length, truly circular in section, well glazed (especially 
‘inside) and had no firecracks or air (or pin) holes; also tap 
them with a hammer and hear them give out a true ring. 
13 Q.—How would you judge a piece of meat as to its 
soundness ? 
A.—By carefully examining it, and if not satisfied by sight 
and smell outwardly, thrust a knife or sharp instrument 
right to the bone, withdraw it quickly and smell. 
14 Q.—How would you proceed if you found a nuisance to exist 
on any premises ? 
A,—If the owner or occupier would not remedy it, by seeing 
him and asking him to do so; I should report it to the 
Sanitary Authority at their next meeting, who should pass a .
-P-A-G-E-163
152 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
resolution to serve a notice upon whoever is responsible. If 
a structural nuisance, the owner ; if not, the occupier. 
15 Q.— What should be done to the notice to make it legal ? 
A.—It must be signed by the clerk or inspector to the Local 
Authority, and a resolution must have been passed (by the 
Local Authority, before it is sent) ordering a notice to be 
served. 
Note,—All the above were asked of one of my students at 
the Viva-voce Examination at Manchester in 1898, and as 
many of the above questions were asked of other students at 
this, and subsequent examinations, I will only give those that 
differ from the above. 
16 Q.—What flush would you give a w.c. ? 
A.—Three gallons. 
17 Q.—Can you get that at your place ? 
A.—Yes. 
Note.—In the case of this student he came from a place 
where three gallons were allowed, I might say, even insisted 
upon. 
18 Q.—But do you know you cannot get three gallous in a large 
number of places ? 
A,—Yes. 
19 Q.—What size of a pipe would you allow to be fixed between 
the cistern and w.c. basin. 
A.—One and a half inch diameter lead pipe. 
20 @—Would not less do ? 
A.—-No; not to efficiently flush the w.c., unless the cistern 
was over six feet above the w.c. pan. Then one and a quarter 
inches would do. 
21 2. —What would you call heating a room by means of a stove? 
A.—Convection. 
22 Q.—How is the room warmed by convection ? 
A.—The air in contact with the stove becomes warm, and, 
being lighter than the cold air, it then rises and the colder 
air descends to become warm in its turn, and so the moving 
masses of air become warmed throughout.

A.—Use patent joints, so that no cement need be used, as the 
Stanford, Doulton, Hassell, Sykes, &c., or, if ordinary pipes 
are used, lay them on 11 inch by 8 inch planks, if necessary 
supported on piles driven into the soft ground and sawn off 
level, or rather to the proper inclination ; or, if possible, 
conerete under the pipes by making a trench and sump for 
the water, clear of the pipe track, keeping the water down 
by pumping. 
28 Q.—Will the velocity be the same in. large sewers as in small 
ones ? : 
A.—It depends upon what quantity of sewage is running 
through them, and on the fall and roughness of the interior. 
With the same volume of sewage and the same. fall and 
roughness, the velocity would be greater in the smaller sewer, 
_ because it would be flowing more full. 
29 Q.—A sketch was shown to this student showing a sink waste- 
_ pipe, trapped by a dipstone trap inside the house, bath 
waste-pipe not trapped, no damp-proof course, nor open 
area, and the soil-pipe terminating near windows in roof. 
The student was asked to point out defects and remedies, As 
T have mentioned the defects, the remedies are : 
A,—The sink and bath-wastes should be trapped inside by a 
5 or P trap, and be taken immediately through the wall, and 
cut short off over a channel leading to a gully at least
-P-A-G-E-165
154 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
18 inches distant. The dipstone trap and drain inside the 
house should be taken up, and all soiled ground around same 
taken away. A damp-proof course should be inserted in 
the wall below the lowermost floor, and if this floor is below 
the ground outside, a dry area should be made between the 
ground and the wall, if possible; and if not, where there is 
no garden or spare land, cement the face of the wall, or 
build a 44-inch wall 1 inch from the face of the house wall, 
and fill up the space with asphalt or hygiene rock. The upper 
end of the soil-pipe should be taken clear above, or far 
removed from all windows that open and from chimneys. 
30 Q.—Three small quantities of some powdered material on 
pieces of paper were here shown to this student, and he was 
asked to name them. They would most likely be Portland 
cement, roman cement and lime, or, perhaps, fine sand. 
31 Q.—A sketch section of a house was shown to this student, 
showing ground and first floors, joists, roof and ceilings. 
On the ground floor was a sink with 8 trap on waste-pipe, 
but no gully outside, so of course it was not disconnected 
from the drain. On the first floor there was a w.c, properly 
connected to a soil-pipe outside, but no separate water-waste- 
preventing cistern to flush w.c. These should be mentioned, 
as the candidate was asked to point out what was wrong and 
how it could be remedied. 
32 Q.—The examiner, when the candidate had pointed out the 
above defects, asked what was the use of the small cistern to 
the w.c.? 
A.—To prevent the fouling of the drinking-water in the 
storage cistern, and also to prevent the waste of water. 
33 Q.—(Wote. The examiner here asked the candidate how, or in 
what way, the w.c, could foul the water in the cistern above.) 
A,—By the odour ascending the flush-pipe, and gaining access 
to the water above when the chain is pulled. 
34 Q.—What would you do with the overflow pipe from the 
storage cistern ? 
A,—Take it straight through the external wall and cut it off 
short in the open air.

35 Q.—What is the meaning of ground air, and how can it gain 
access to a dwelling-house ? 
A,—Ground air is the air in the ground or soil between the 
level of the subsoil water and the surface, and it gains access 
to dwelling-houses when there is no concrete or asphalt 
covering over the whole site of the house. The inside of the 
house being warmer, usually, than outside, attracts or draws 
the air; also the rising of the subsoil water discharges the 
ground air into the atmosphere, and into houses where the 
covering mentioned has been omitted. 
36 Q—What is a drain ? 
A.—According to the Public Health Act, 1875, a drain is 
any drain which takes the sewage from one house or building 
only or from premises in the same curtilage. 
37 Q.—-What is a sewer ? 
A,—AIl sewers which take the sewage from more than one 
house or premise, except sewers made by any person for his 
own profit, or made and used for draining or irvigating land, 
or under Commissioners of Sewers appointed by the Crown. 
38 Q.—What is this? (Wote——The examiner here showed the 
candidate a rough sketch, showing two houses connected to 
@ passage sewer, and pointing to the sewer in the passage 
  asked, “ What is this?” See Fig. 48.)

39 Q.—What is the pressure of water at a point in a pipe like 
this? (Wote.—A sketch was shown to the candidate showing 
a cistern full of water, and a pipe from the bottom taken
-P-A-G-E-167

vertically down for a distance of 20 feet, then horizontally 
for a distance of 20 feet, and the point marked X.) 
A,.—It is only the vertical height that is taken into account 
for pressure, so '433 x 20 = 8°66 Ibs. per square inch pressure 
at point X. (See Fig. 49.) 
  Fie. 50. 
A,—Add the three sides together, divide the result by two, 
then from the half sum of the three sides subtract each side 
separately ; multiply the three results together and extract 
the square root, which gives the area required. The formula 
being area=,/8 (S-a)(S- 6) (S—c), then where S=} the 
sum of the three sides, and. a, 6, c=the three sides, 
area= /15(15 — 1015 - 1015 — 10)= JIB x 5x 5X5 
= ,/1875 =43°3 (approximately) feet, if the length of the 
three sides are in feet, or inches, if the sides are given in 
inches, &e.   
41 Q.—Supposing a man had a cart-load of cheese which was bad, 
under what section and Act could you seize it ? 
A.—The cheese could not be seized unless the Public Health 
(Amendment) Act of 1890 had been adopted, which Act, 
by section 28, includes all articles used by man as food,
-P-A-G-E-168
VIVA-VOCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 157 
The Public Health Act, 1875, mentions certain articles of 
food which can be seized, but cheese is not mentioned, nor 
eggs, so the Inspector must proceed under the Amendment 
Act if adopted, and if not he could not seize the cheese. 
42 Q.—Supposing a man had a farmyard full of poultry which 
was a nuisance, would you ask him to remove the same, or 
how would you do? 
A,—I should ask him to remove the nuisance, but he could 
not be made to remove the poultry. I am supposing the 
nuisance to be from smell, caused by neglect of cleansing 
after the poultry and, perhaps, decayed vegetables, fish, fruit, 
and flesh lying about; if he did not do so, I should then 
report the matter to the Sanitary Authority, who should order 
a notice to be served on him and summon him before a Court 
of Summary Jurisdiction, if he did not abate the nuisance 
in a given time stated in the notice. 
Note.—If the nuisance is caused by noise only, the Inspec- 
tor of Nuisances has nothing to do with the matter, and the 
person annoyed must take proceedings himself. 
43 Q.—How many persons will it take to consume the same 
amount of air as one gas burner? 
A.—An ordinary gas burner will consume about four cubic 
feet of gas per hour: and will, therefore, require a supply 
of about 6000 or 7000 cubic feet of air per hour, or as much 
as required by two adult persons. 
44 Q.— What is a model bylaw ? 
A.—It is a bylaw made by the Local Government Board for 
the guidance of Local Authorities in the making of bylaws. 
45 Q.—How would you disinfect a drain ? 
A.—I should have it well flushed, by suddenly pouring down 
it alarge tub-full of water, to which has been added a solution 
of carbolic acid or some other disinfectant. The best way 
would be to stop the drain by means of a plug at its lower 
end (say in a manhole), then fill it with a solution of 1 in 
1000 of corrosive sublimate and let it stand awhile, then well 
-flush afterwards with clean water. 
46 Q.—How many gallons would a 4-inch drain 20 feet long 
contain ? 
A,—Square the diameter of the pipe in inches and multiply
-P-A-G-E-169
158 LESSONS ON SANITATION 
by ‘034, which gives the gallons (approximately) in 1-foot 
length of pipe, then multiply by length of pipe in feet: thus 
4x4 = 16x -084 = -544 x 20 = 10-88 gallons in the drain 
(approximately). 
47 Q.—Why multiply by -034 ? 
A.—It is the quantity or amount in gallons (or part of a 
gallon) contained in a pipe 1 inch in diameter and 1 foot long. 
48 Q.—What is Condy’s Fluid composed of ? 
A.—It is said to consist of solutions of the alkaline man- 
ganates and permanganates. The manganates (which are 
green crystals) are soluble in water. ‘The permanganates are 
deep purple crystalline salts. 
49 Q.—How many gallons of water would a bucket hold? 
A.—This depends upon the size of the bucket. An ordinary 
sized bucket holds about two gallons. The way to find the 
quantity by calculation is to find the cubic contents in feet, 
and multiply by 6-25, the quantity of gallons (approximately) 
in a cubic foot. A bucket is a frustum of a cone, and 
the formula for a frustum is: 1/3 H (A+a+,/Aa), where 
H=height of frustum, A=area of base or large end, and 
a=area of top or small end. : 
50 Q.—Whait is the weight of one gallon of water ? 
A.—Ten lbs, 
51 Q.—How many cubic inches are there in a gallon of water ? 
A.— 277274, 
52 Q.— What is water composed of ? 
A.—By weight: Sixteen parts of oxygen and two paris of 
hydrogen. By measure: One part of oxygen and two parts 
of hydrogen. The latter is generally expressed by the 
chemical formula, H,0. . 
53 Q.—What is the weight or pressure of the atmosphere ? 
A.—14-706 lbs. per square inch, usually taken at 15 ibs. per 
square inch, 
54 Q.—How do you test drains by the “ scent,” or “smell,” test ? 
A.—There are several ways: (1) By pouring down the drain 
or soil-pipe a solution of oi] of peppermint or some other
-P-A-G-E-170
; eal 
a 
Ml VIVA-VOCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 159 
strong smelling liquid in water; (2) a better way is to use 
a “Banner's” drain explorer, by introducing a glass grenade 
through the water seal of a trap, such as a gully or w.c., 
and then to break the glass grenade and release the substance 
it contains, which gives off a pungent odour, 
55 Q.—Describe a “ Banner’s Drain Explorer,” and a “ Glass 
Grenade.” 
A.—The “ Explorer ” consists of a grooved wooden ball, about 
24-inch diameter, containing a strong spiral spring, fixed in 
the ball in a hole bored down to or below its centre. The 
glass grenade is a hermetically sealed tube of thin glass, 
about 2 inches long, which contains a chemical possessing a 
powerful and penctrating odour ; in shape it is like a spirit 
level tube. 
56 Q.—How do you fix the glass grenade in the “ Explorer,” 
and how do you use it when fixed ? > 
A.—The spring inside the ball is first compressed by means 
of a short lever, which is fixed or pivoted at one end toa 
  Fre. 51. 
brass or copper wire (which encircles the ball) sunk in-a 
groove. The free end of the lever is held down by a clip 
(which is also hinged or pivoted on the wire); to the free 
end of the clip is fixed a Jong cord for the purpose of pulling
-P-A-G-E-171
160 LESSONS ON SANITATION ~ 
the clip off the lever, and releasing the spring, thus breaking 
the glass grenade; the cord is also used to draw back the 
« Explorer ” after the test is complete. A glass grenade is 
then placed under two wire staples on the top of the 
“ Explorer,” and across the portion cut away for the lever 
to work in, the grenade is held in position by an india-rubber 
band. All being ready, the ‘‘ Explorer” is placed gently in 
the water in the gully or closet trap, and the free end of the 
cord secured. The “Explorer” is then washed over the 
trap by means of a bucket of water (hot water is best), a 
slight pull or jerk is given to the cord and the clip is pulled 
off the lever, the spring sends the lever upwards and thus 
breaks the glass grenade, releasing the chemical. The 
  Fie. 52. 
“ Explorer ” should be left in the drain or soil pipe until the 
~search for leaks is completed, as, if it is withdrawn, the odour 
from it, or from some fragment of the glass grenade, may 
permeate the room. 
Note._I give sketches (Figs. 51 and 52) of explorer and 
glass grenade, 
57 Q.—What is this? (Note——The Examiner here showed the 
candidate a Smoke Rocket, used for testing drains where a 
proper machine cannot be obtained for the purpose.) 
A.--A smoke rocket for testing drains. 
Note.—For the information of students who have never 
seen one, I may explain that the rocket is a cylindrical case, 
about seven to ten inches long, and two inches in diameter, 
One or two strips of wood are attached to the rocket to keep 
it clear of the drain invert, thus allowing any water which 
may find its way into the drain a clear way under the rocket. 
58 Q.—What is the advantage of egg-shaped sewers ? 
A,—The velocity of flow is greater when a small volume of 
sewage is in the sewer than it would be in a sewer of a 
circular shape of the same sectional area, as the sewage is
-P-A-G-E-172
VIVA-VOCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 161 
deeper and there is less friction against the bottom and 
sides of the sewer. 
9 Q.—What is meant by the hydraulic mean depth ? 
A.—The hydraulic mean depth is the cross-section of the 
stream (or sewage) divided by the wetted perimeter, 
O Qi—What is the wetted perimeter ? . 
A.—The portion of the circumference of the pipe (or sewer) 
wetted with the sewage (or stream). 
31 Q.—How do you find the velocity of. flow ? 
i.—It is determined by the fall, the smoothness (or other- 
wise) of the inside of the pipe (or sewer) and the hydraulic 
mean depth, A common and much used formula is 
« Parke’s,” which is: V = 55 x /2DF, per minute where 
V = velocity in feet per minute, F = the fall in feet per mile, 
D = the hydraulic mean depth, in feet. 
Note.—This latter is one-fourth the diameter of the pipe 
when running full or half full. 
Q.—How do you find the cubic feet discharged per minute ? 
A,—Multiply the velocity in feet per minute by the sectional 
area of the sewage (or stream) in feet. 
Q.—Give the formula for finding the quantity of air that 
would ascend a flue or shaft per hour? 
A,—De Chaumoni’s is the most convenient; this is as follows: 
200 (/ & ( - t) (002 P.A) = D, where 
h=height of flue or shaft in feet, 
= temperature within shaft. 
t = temperature of outer air, 
002 = rate of expansion for each degree Fahr. 
P = area of shaft in square inches. 
A = factor for friction, generally 3. 
D = delivery in cubic feet per hour, 
64 Q.—How would you disinfect books, boots, a fur muff, or a 
sealskin jacket without damaging them ? 
A.—Expose them freely in a gas-tight box or case to formal- 
dehyde vapour, about one cubic centimetre of formalin to 300 cubic centimetres or less of air, The books should be so 
suspended that the leaves fall open.

65 Q.—How should a screw-down tap be repaired ? 
A.—A screw-down tap is an ordinary tap for house service; 
and the only repair it usually needs is a leather washer being 
putin, Any other repair would most likely need a plumber 
and a new tap. 
66 Q.—What is an iron tie for bonding hollow, or cavity, walls? 
A,.—These are made of both wrought and cast iron and even 
iron wire ; they should be twisted or drooped in the middle 
to prevent moisture being conveyed along them from the 
outside portion to the inside portion of the wall ; they should 
algo be well tarred and sanded or galvanised to prevent 
rusting. They are either rough or turned down a little at 
the ends or, sometimes, split and widened out to allow of a 
grip in the mortar-joint. 
Note.—See Fig. 53 for Bonding or Iron Tie,

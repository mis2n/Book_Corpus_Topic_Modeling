PREFACE 
Tuts book is a systematic treatise neither on psychology 
nor on education. It endeavours to set forth the rela- 
tion between them. This relation must be found in 
the actual lives of individual children, and it is to help 
people engaged ‘in education to study those lives that 
I have written. I have endeavoured to keep as free 
as possible from technicalities, and throughout to deal 
with life as a developing whole. Though the treat- 
ment is psychological, the selection of topics has been 
determined by educational considerations. The end 
sought is a presentation of the general form in which 
efficiency of life develops through ever-extending pur- 
poses. The various human faculties are regarded as 
factors inter-mingled, in an indefinitely large variety of 
ways, in every piece of life, and are, therefore, not 
considered apart and in themselves. Similarly, little 
or nothing is said of elements of experience which are 
merely constituent of fuller forms of life. 
That a much more extensive and exact knowledge of 
facts must be attained before the course of mental 
development can be set forth with scientific precision 
and completeness is certain. But for the purpose here 
in view this is not altogether a disadvantage. The 
main lines are, I believe, sound, and the reader is, by 
the very generality of the treatment, forced to recognize

that he cannot get all he wants by reading, but that 
a substantial part of the work is left for him to do. 
Moreover, if a detailed chart of life could be laid 
down the temptation to forget that it could be only 
an abstraction and to consider it as a kind of biography 
of every child would be one which many would be 
unable to resist. Then the study of psychology would 
tend to make educative work unpsychological. For it 
is individual lives with which the educator has to deal, 
‘not generalized averages. Still, more detailed know- 
ledge is wanted. But it is knowledge of concrete 
pieces of life, not of isolated facts torn from their 
vital context. If, to any degree, this book should 
inspire those who find it helpful to publish precise 
records of careful observations on points which especi- 
ally interest them it will be of some service to the 
cause of psychology as well as to that of education.

CHAPTER I 
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 
Many teachers contemn psychology, . : : . . 
but are good practical psychologists; . 
educative power. is dependent on psychology ; 
generalizatiori of practical prychology needs guidance and 
verification. 
Current theoretical psychology is too intellectualistic : . . 
its unrecognized influence on education ; 
the hypothesis of independent faculties ; 
the Herbartian psychology. . . : . . 
Psychology of the adult and of the child: . . . 
nature of child-experience ; . : . 
nature and extent of mental advance; . . 
need for understanding one’s own life ; . 
recognition of social character of experience... 
Education is more than applied psychology ; 
for psychology cannot decide its purpose, . . 
nor evaluate its means, whether of matter or method ; 
teaching method is both psychological and logical ; 
education uses psychology but is not limited by it. . 
CHAPTER II 
THE STUDY OF MENTAL LIFE 
Books are helpful as guides and commentaries, . . 
but the real material of study is experience, . . . 
which should be traced in retrospect. .

GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 
General function of instinct. .  .  . . oe 
Instinct in the lower animidls. ‘ . . . 
Instinct is not mere behaviour. . 7 6 . 
but includes mental prompting. . . : 
Human instincts are proclivities to classes of actions, . 
develop in experience, . . . 
are brought under the direction of intelligence, . 
and may be modified by education, . . . 
but are operative throughout life. 
Instincts show adaptation by increased range of origin, . 
and modification of reaction; . . . . 
and become fused. . . . 
The number of human instincts must be determined by the 
number of primary emotions; —. . : . 
for instincts are complete mental processes, . . 
The human instincts: 
hunger and thirst; . . . . . 
fear ; . . . . . “ . .

LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 
Learning is constant in life, . : . 
and is guided by the doings and the speech of others 5 3 
dangers of neglecting either personal experience or in- 
struction ; . 
all learning should promote ‘efficiency, : : - . 
and should, therefore, be the outcome of effort, . . 
to which teaching prompts ; : 
teaching both follows and guides natural development. . 
The natural process of learning is the basis of teaching : . 
it does not build wholes out of elements, . . . 
but analyses apprehended wholes, . : : - 
and forms habits—or organs—of knowing. . - . 
Recognition is interpretation of signs, . . . - . 
involving implicit expectations, . : : . 
and taking for granted results of experience ; ; 
organs of knowledge are effective in proportion to fallness 3 
the test is power to use. . 
All knowledge contains perceptual and conceptual material 5 
teaching helps to make the latter explicit; . . . 
early apprehension of causality, space, time, number; . 
facts are of value only as related, . . - 
and relations without facts are useless ; . : 
relations implicit before they are explicit. . “ . 
Growth of perceptual knowledge: . . . . . 
involves acquired limitation of attention; . : . 
pleasure of acquiring perceptual knowledge ; . . 
clear percepts necessary to intelligent concepts ; 
perceptual knowledge results from doing and is tested ty 
doing ; : : 
examples from drawing and painting ; 3. : . 
need for training in discriminative observation. . .

CHARACTER 
Ambiguous use of ‘character’ in writings on education. 
‘Character’ in common speech implies : 
kind of moral value ; . 
extent of outlook, or practical knowledge of life, 
but not amount of information ; . . . 
strength and stability of purpose ; : . . 
causes of weakness of character; . . . . 
gradual formation of character; . : 
the essence of character is organization of life, . 
but this does not imply uniformity, 
at which education should not aim. PAGB

CHAPTER I 
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 
A scHooLMaSTER once caustically described psychology 
as ‘putting what everybody knows in language which 
nobody can understand.” Although it cannot be 
granted that this somewhat cynical estimate is “‘the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth” yet 
it must be confessed that it has a specious plausibility. ° 
For the whole subject-matter of psychology is our own 
inner experience, than which nothing can be more 
familiar, and it is as natural as it is mistaken to assume 
that the familiar is always understood. Yet, in truth, 
most people are so engrossed in living that they find no 
time to understand life. 
The tyro in psychology, then, finding that the 
topics discussed are old acquaintances, is apt to think 
that there is nothing new except the names by which 
these old friends are called. Here he finds some 
familiar terms used in ways not so familiar and generally 
with a stringency to which he is unaccustomed, and 
some strange terms which seem to him only to express 
facts about which he has been accustomed to think and 
speak without their help. By each use he is more or 
less repelled. 
This is, no doubt, an attitude not uncommonly taken 
by students who are required to read psychology as part 
A §

of their training for the work of teaching. The very 
fact that they approach the subject, not as one of which 
their own experience has made them feel the need but 
simply as one required for a certain examination, tends 
to make them regard it as matter to be understood and 
remembered indeed, not to be practised. As well 
might one attempt to become a botanist from the study } 
of books alone. The result is apt to show itself in 
a greater or less facility of writing and talking empty ; 
verbosity adorned with tags of psychological nomen- 
clature. In a practical mind this breeds disgust. 
Doubtless, the culmination of such an experience was 
marked by the heartfelt exclamation of a student at 
the close of his course of training: ‘‘’Thank heavens! 
Pve done with psychology at last.” 
Of course there is an obvious retort. When such! 
a person affirms in after life that he has never found 
the psychology he studied as a student of any use to 
him in his professional work, it would be both true and 
pertinent—if impolite—to reply ‘But you never did 
study psychology, and the fact that you speak of your 
study as in the past proves it.’/ Yet, to point out that 
many have made a particular mistake does not prevent 
others from falling into the same error. 
I by no means wish to imply, however, that all teachers, 
who contemn psychology do so because they have never] 
really approached it. Some of those, indeed, of whom| 
we have just been speaking become good psychologists 
despite themselves and without recognizing it. Often, 
no doubt, the term carries for them such unpleasant 
associations, as denoting an empty and soul-deadening’ 
verbalism, that they would repudiate with scorn and| 
indignation the charge of being psychologists. Psycho-

logy to them still means analyses and tabulations of 
certain abstractions, and they seldom bridge the chasm 
which stretches between that pedantic erudition, as it is 
to them, and the living knowledge of the children they 
teach which has been attained by constant sympathetic 
intercourse. Yet this is the real psychology which alone 
is of worth to the practical educator. 
Despite their outspoken attitude of contempt towards 
theoretical psychology, probably no teachers in the world 
take more personal interest in their pupils, and gain a 
more real and intimate knowledge of them, than do many 
in our own country. Boys and girls are to them not 
merely pupils, not simply pegs to be fitted with more or 
less violence into more or less wrongly shaped holes ; 
they remain throughout and under all the school routine 
just boys and girls. And the aim of the master or 
mistress, like that of the parent, is first and foremost to 
make out of those boys and girls men and women who 
will live noble and useful lives in their various callings. 
To secure this all kinds of influences are brought to bear ; 
and many an hour does the good teacher, like the good 
parent, spend in thinking how Tommy is going wrong, 
and how best to lead him back to the right way ; how 
Jack’ is falling off in enthusiasm for sport or lessons, 
the reasons for this declension, and the course which 
in view of those reasons it will be wise to adopt: 
for what kind of occupation Harry is showing most 
aptitude. Such problems as these loom at least as large _ 
in the mind of every true educator as do those of instruc- ~ 
tion. Even in the latter the good teacher is always 
seeking fresh ways to evoke the desire for knowledge, to 
stimulate and encourage effort, to cultivate taste, to 
direct and strengthen purpose. ‘These are all psycho-
-P-A-G-E-24
4 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
logical problems, for they all involve meditation on the 
nature of the child’s experience, and on how the teacher, 
by regulating his own actions, can modify that experience. 
In such ways experienced teachers often attain a very . 
remarkable amount of pertinent psychological know- 
ledge and insight, and are, indeed, among our best 
practical psychologists. They can teach the beginner 
much, even though they may never have heard such 
blessed words as psychosis and apperception, nor have 
made experiments with chronoscopes, kinetoscopes, and 
ergographs. Nor can any beginner in teaching ever be 
as good a child-psychologist as are these veterans, even 
though he may have mastered all the text-books on the 
subject that have ever been written. 
~’ Yet these experts in child life are often the very people 
who assert most strongly that they find no help in the 
books. To advance against their position the argument 
that as psychology is the study of experience it must help 
those whose work it is to mould and direct experience is 
obviously beside the mark and has more than a suspicion | 
of begging the question. For it assumes that the | 
psychology which is helpful is the psychology which they | 
reject. Really it is not so atall. _ The psychology which | 
is useful to them they have studied—as only can it be | 
truly studied—by direct, sympathetic and intimate | 
observation of the young.} True, they do not call it’ 
psychology, but it is psychology all the same, for it is an | 
understanding of mental life,,/ 
When due weight is given to such considerations as | 
these it will, I think, be evident that no one can educate | 
without a real practical psychology, that is, a true | 
knowledge of his pupils. Teachers and parents in| 
so far as they lack this are nothing better than

external forces which define more or less narrowly 
the course of the child’s life; they are not, and never 
can be, agents influencing that course of life from 
within so as to make it richer and fuller. Such 
practical psychology can be_gained only through 
that real sympathy with the young which involves 
not only kindly feeling but power to understand, 
which is an insight into the child’s desires, his plans, his 
thoughts—an insight which grows by successful practice 
till at times it becomes almost uncanny. Some people _ 
have such insight by natural gift, others have not; the — 
majority have a little of it which can either be cherished 
or smothered. The first are the heaven-born teachers ; 
and they are few. The second are people—also few, but 
by no means unknown—who never can become educators 
nor ever learn to teach well. These ought never to 
enter, or if they have unwittingly entered should leave as 
quickly as possible, the profession of schoolmaster, for 
no amount of training or experience can fit them to do 
their work with satisfaction to themselves or with profit 
to their pupils. For the great majority the primary duty 
is to cherish and foster that innate divine spark of sym- 
pathetic insight which alone will enable them tb become 
“artists in the souls of children.” 
- We seem, then, to have come to this: that the heaven- 
born teacher becomes a-psychologist because he cannot 
help it; that the average teacher can only develop into 
the good teacher by becoming a psychologist ; that the 
person who cannot by any means become a psychologist 
must always be lamentably out of place in school. 
There is little doubt that the many practical psycho- 
logists among our teachers will grant freely the value 
here claimed for a knowledge and understanding of
-P-A-G-E-26
6 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
children’s lives. They know that all their successful 
work is built up on such insight. ‘Will they not follow 
usa step further and grant that from much specific know- 
ledge of individuals they draw more or less wide-reaching 
generalizations? But these are of the nature of science. 
Psychology as a science must, like every other science, 
rest upon careful examination of facts, and consist of 
valid inductions from them. Really, each true educator 
has formed his own science of child-experience ; he not 
‘only knows his own children but he has, more or less 
consciously, generalized from them. This is, however, 
a slow process to most, and one attended by many mis- 
takes. In teaching and in influencing and guiding 
others the ordinary man or woman often goes wrong 
before learning to go right. Life must have brought 
home to all of us the truth which Roger Ascham long 
ago pointed out: “Learning teacheth more in one yeare 
than experience in twentie.... He hasardeth sore, that 
waxeth wise by experience... We know by experience | 
it selfe, that it is a mervelous paine, to finde oute but a | 
short waie, by long wandering.” + ; 
(In the study of the young nothing can take the place. 
of ‘experience; but will not the individual experience | 
accomplish its work more perfectly and more rapidly if | 
it be guided and tested by the accumulated experiences of , 
others? Even with such guidance every educator will’ 
make mistakes in dealing with the young. But the 
experienced man avoids, as it were by instinct, errors 4 
which cause the beginner much trouble at the time and | 
much discouragement and weariness of heart. Could} 
the beginner avail himself of the other’s experience he, 
might avoid many such pitfalls.

EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 7 
To give such guidance, then, should be the aim of 
theoretical educational psychology. It should consist of 
generalizations from an experience wider than that of any 
individual educator, but of the same kind as those which 
each real educator makes. The collation of these will 
separate the usual from the exceptional, and will trace the 
broad outline of normal development from childhood to 
manhood. But the exceptions also will demand careful 
study, for every abnormal case is an extreme develop- 
ment of something which, in a lesser degree, is found in 
the normal human being. The study of such a psycho- 
logy cultivates a certain kind of outlook, gives some 
familiarity with broad and common features of mental 
lite, indicates methods by which that life may be most 
fruitfully studied, lays down some general canons of 
interpreting the actions of others, enables us to test our 
results by comparison with those of other observers, and, _ 
perhaps more important than all, puts us on our guard 
against applying to the conduct of the young the maxims 
of adult life. ’ 
Such a psychology is only in the making. That in 
the ordinary theoretical treatises is of a very different 
character. It may, indeed, without serious exaggeration 
be said to be the psychology of the adult philosopher. 
The reading of such treatises leaves the impression that 
intellect is the all important factor in life, and that 
emotion and will are much less worthy of attention. 
Now, even the adult only occasionally guides his conduct 
by the light of pure reason ; the young child never. A 
psychology which implies that reason is the lord of 
conduct treats what is in most lives the exceptional as 
if it were the general rule. Most emphatically unreal 
is such a psychology when the life of the young is in
-P-A-G-E-28
8 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
question. Nothing more unlike a child can well be 
imagined than the smoothly working thinking-machine 
there set before us. No wonder that few educators find 
such books helpful, or that the ordinary cultivated man 
prefers to pursue his studies in human conduct in the 
company of such psychologists as George Meredith or 
Thomas Hardy who show the actual play of forces in 
real human lives. 
Yet the influence of this intellectualistic adult psycho- 
logy is everywhere to be seen in education, and is every- 
where unfortunate. Certain psychological conceptions 
are current in every society. This, indeed, must be so, 
for men and women do know something of their own 
lives, and do talk about them. This involves the use 
of certain terms to which a general, if vague, meaning 
attaches. The implications are usually accepted with 
the terms, and in that way everybody is some sort of 2 
psychologist. There is, so to say, a psychological ele- 
ment in the general intellectual atmosphere. The only 
escape from being obsessed by this vague current psycho- 
logy is by strenuous and persistent thought to attain a 
truer conception of life, and one less liable to be full of 
those inconsistencies which are the ordinary marks of 
general notions unconsciously derived from current 
modes of speech. 
Will anyone deny, when he thinks over the idea of 
education current in England, that it is dominated by 
a much too exclusively intellectualistic view of mental 
life? Is not education made synonymous with schooling, 
and schooling with instruction? When the numerous 
orators on public platforms talk of improving education, 
do they not nearly always mean the learning of some’ 
new subject or the study of an old one in a new way? |
-P-A-G-E-29
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 9 
Do not many people imply by ‘educational teaching’ 
simply the training of various intellectual powers? 
We must, indeed, go further. Not only does the 
vague current psychology of the day give a definite bias 
to practical education, but the hypotheses of professed 
psychologists show a great inherent vitality as maxims 
of education long after they have been decently buried 
by the psychologists themselves. May we say that this 
is a natural result of the general neglect of theoretical 
psychology by the very people who, as practical psycho- 
logists, could give to it that contact with aspects of real 
life which it is apt to lack? 
We still hear people talk of training various ‘ faculties* 
by special kinds of mental work, as if these mysterious 
powers were independent organs which could be trained 
separately by exercise—as, for instance, the arm could 
be trained apart from the rest of the body—and, once 
trained, could be used to do any form of appropriate 
work. We are still told that ‘‘ Jack remembers his 
lessons well because he has a good memory,” though 
the professed psychologist would smile a kindly if rather 
superior smile, and point out that the supposed explana- 
tion simply states the explained fact in other words. 
Jack remembers well what he remembers well. ‘True! 
But there is little ground here for making Jack learn a 
mass of things by heart in order that he may in future 
remember other things. ‘‘ But,” it will be urged, ‘‘ the 
mind should surely be trained.’ Most certainly, and 
an educational psychology ought to take as its topic 
this—how the mind can best be trained. But then, 
mind is not equivalent to intellect, nor is the exercise of 
isolated powers the same thing as the training of the 
mind.
-P-A-G-E-30
10 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
The essential aim of most adult psychology has been 
analysis, and through analysis a clearer comprehension 
of the modes of mental action. Though this method 
has many advantages for its own end, it is most mis- 
leading when its abstract results are regarded as actual 
mental processes. Mental life isa whole, and as a whole 
education has to deal with it. It is a growing and 
developing whole, and education should promote that 
growth and direct that development. As we shall hope 
to show later the question to be asked of an educational 
instrument is not——Will it train the observation, the 
memory, the imagination, etc. ? but—How will it enlarge 
and enrich the experience of children who have reached 
this particular stage of development, and so help on their 
advance to the next stage? To this the analysis of 
mental powers or faculties can give no answer. 
If, indeed, the educative aim were to train these 
powers, and if the training could be given them in 
isolation, then there would be obvious advantages in 
studying them in the most perfect form accessible to us. | 
The results of our investigations into our own powers - 
would be checked by the testimony of those whose 
powers were greater. We should regard ourselves as 
imperfect in so far as we fell below the highest standard, 
and the children as more imperfect still. In a word, 
we should look upon them as very incomplete and even 
fragmentary men and women. Such an attitude towards 
them does indeed show itself continually in the treatment 
of even quite young children both by parents and by | 
teachers. The little ones are assumed to act from adult | 
motives, are asked why they did this or that, why they | 
prefer this to that, and generally are regarded as some- | 
what badly made reasoning-machines. In so far as this 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY II 
attitude is taken the child’s natura] growth receives no 
help. On the contrary there is cultivated in him a kind 
of pose—an assumption of feelings and motives which 
he never has. 
This faculty-training hypothesis is evidently most 
operative in teaching. Some say that the great thing is 
to exercise the will, so that it does not matter what a boy 
learns so long as he dislikes doing it. Others advocate 
concentration in mathematics on the ground that it trains 
good reasoners. Some urge the study of natural science 
in order that the children may become proficient in obser- 
vation and inference, others claim that learning Latin 
gives the most complete exercise to all the important 
intellectual faculties. In each case the belief is implicit 
that a power once acquired will be operative in every 
sphere of experience, and not simply in that in which it 
was trained. The results do not bear out this expecta- 
tion. The impotence, moreover, of the theory as a 
guide to the choice of subjects to be taught was made 
very plain in the great struggle between classics and 
science to be the chief element in school work ; for the 
advocates on each side for years based their arguments 
on exactly the same psychological assumptions of faculty 
training. 
This old and discredited hypothesis is implicitly 
accepted by many teachers who are in other ways true 
educators. In matters of influence and discipline they 
are not obsessed by a futile psychology, and they act on 
the basis of the true psychology they have learnt from 
intercourse with their pupils. But in teaching they 
follow a tradition which rests on a psychology implicitly 
taken for granted, but which is a mischievously false 
guide. Hence, their teaching is often much weaker
-P-A-G-E-32
12 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
than their general educative influence. Hence, too, q 
arises the separation of the work of the school from the | 
real interests of life. For, if the school concerns itself | 
only with the exercise of mental powers it naturally } 
plans its curriculum with the consideration solely of the | 
kind of exercise each subject can furnish, and is satisfied 
when it has provided for each of the arbitrary list of 
powers. The relation of those powers to the interests | 
and requirements of the world around is branded as 
‘utilitarian? and dismissed as ‘ uneducational. | 
Fhere_is, however,~o “usa psychology which 
explicitly rejects the faculty hypothesis. This is associ- 
ated with the honoured name of Herbart, and also dates 
from the days before the theory of evolution became a - 
living force in men’s minds. Most modern Herbartians * 
reject their master’s metaphysical assumptions, but the | 
whole framework of their theory of education is based . 
on his conception of life. + (Chere is no need to examine | 
it here in detail, because as an essentially intellectualistic | 
psychology of adult life it is open to the same funda- © 
mental objections we have already considered) The | 
Herbartian theory of apperception does, undoubtedly, | 
describe one aspect of the growth of experience. But | 
it assumes that organs of knowledge already exist in . 
the mind it is considering, and it maintains that these 3 
intellectual organs operate by their own inherent power. | 
From their action both feeling and will are said to arise. | 
This psychology is, therefore, even more emphatically 
intellectualistic than is the faculty psychology, for the 
latter did regard the will as an independent faculty. 
Of course it follows from this conception of mental | 
life that the Herbartian regards instruction as the one 
essential instrument of education. ‘Teach a boy to  
-P-A-G-E-33
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 13 
understand morality and he will act morally” is quite 
a legitimate deduction from the doctrine that will grows 
out of the connexion of thoughts. Here, again, experi- 
ence fails to uphold the theory; and psychological 
theory, like all other theory, is condemned if facts 
contradict it. , 
Once again, then, we are driven back to the child 
himself as the one and only source of our facts, the one 
and only birthplace of our theory. ‘‘Study the child, 
for it is certain you do not understand him” said 
Rousseau, and since his time something has been done. 
Yet it is evident that if this study be approached with 
a pre-conceived adult theory its results will be of little 
worth. Too often this has been the case. The observer 
has started with the categories of adult life obtained from 
such analyses as we have mentioned. One of two 
opposed errors results. 
The one—to which we have already referred—is to 
read into the child-life an experience fuller and more 
definite than it can possibly have. For example, to 
assume that when a boy of ten does a cruel act he has 
the same ill-feeling which would lead an adult to act 
cruelly, or that when a child makes surreptitious use of 
his neighbour’s work he is guilty of the same kind of 
deliberate fraud as an adult forger, is to assume that the 
young offender looks at his relations to others from the 
standpoint which only long years of intercourse have 
made possible to his adult judge. 
There is, however, a more insidious, and at the present 
day a more fashionable, danger than this looking upon 
the child as a miniature adult. This is the assumption 
that the child’s mind is different in kind and constitution 
from that of the adult. The higher faculties, such as
-P-A-G-E-34
14 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
reason, conscience, will, and the more refined sentiments, 
are denied him. His mind is thus regarded as an 
imperfect fragment of an adult mind, and the observer 
asks such questions as—When does such and such a 
power manifest itself? that is, taking the results of the 
analysis of adult consciousness—When does each of the 
classes thus obtained first appear in the child’s history? 
Such an error vitiated the child psychology, and through 
it the general educational scheme, of Rousseau. 
There is at the bottom of both these errors the same 
false assumption—that analysis of adult experience gives 
a classification of powers which are similarly differenti- 
ated from each other in the child. The one error assumes 
that they are innate; the other that they appear serially 
like the leaves and fruit on a tree, and the task of 
genetic psychology is then supposed to be to find in 
what order, and at about what age, they manifest them- 
selves. 1 
The results thus obtained are of little interest and of 
less value. The problem is approached in a wrong 
way—the question asked is in false terms. It is true 
that the child will become an adult, and that when he 
reaches maturity the categories of maturity will apply | 
to him. But it is not true that his progress is from 4. 
mutilated and incomplete mind to one which possesses | 
all its organs. At every stage of his development 2 | 
child’s experience is as full and satisfying to him as is | 
that of a philosophical psychologist to himself. ‘That 
is, he is always in full relation to his world, he puts forth 
all his powers, he is only prevented from accomplishing | 
all his desires by obstacles similar to those which equally | 
hinder the adult. The child feels no sense of incom-| 
pleteness different in kind from that felt by any adult, 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 15 
who finds that there are limits to his knowledge and his 
power. 
The essential difference between the experience of the 
youngest child and that of the philosopher is that the 
former is vague and undifferentiated both in its outer 
reference to the world around and in its inner mode of 
affecting him. The philosopher thinks, that is, he sub- 
sumes his experiences under certain abstract ideas which 
both individualize and connect its elements; the young 
child feels, that is, he is vaguely aware of himself and 
his surroundings, but at first neither separates nor relates. 
them. Progress from the one stage to the other is a 
gradual and continuous awareness of complexity—of at 
once separating elements of experience and connecting 
them in definite relations with each other. On this road 
individuals advance at different rates and to various 
points. The real problem of genetic psychology is to 
enquire how such development is brought about. In 
other words it is a causal enquiry, the object of which 
is to discover what kind of influences lead most suitably 
from any one stage to that which naturally grows out 
of it. It is true that when a new step is clearly made 
it is often possible to classify it under one of the cate- 
gories of adult life. But even so the name really denotes 
modes of experience of very different value and function 
in the child and in the adult. The vital problems are— 
How did it gradually grow out of past experience and 
to what will it develop in future experience? 
Nor must it be forgotten that not only do adults differ 
in the total amount of advance in mental life but that 
each one of us at any one time would find himself at 
many different stages of advancement, if the point were 
decided by abstract conceptions of such typical activities
-P-A-G-E-36
i6 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
as understanding, reasoning, and so on. Are there not 
some books and arguments which we can understand 
perfectly ; that is, their constituent parts stand clear | 
before us and we appreciate fully their relations? And 
are there not others before which we find ourselves ina | 
mental fog which all our efforts fail to dispel? ‘‘ We 
cannot follow the argument” we say, and this means that 
we cannot grasp the force of the distinctions made, nor 
their relations to each other and to the whole discussion. | 
If in such a case we wish to understand we have a 
feeling of unrest, but often we do not care whether we | 
understand or no, and at times we think we understand 
when we really do not, because, perchance, some of the | 
elements are clear to us, or because the whole is familiar, | 
at any rate in name. To all these forms of adult con- 
sciousness the child presents us with parallels. The | 
things which arouse the various states are different with | 
him and with us, but that does not affect the mental | 
character of the experience. Sometimes, even as to the | 
object the experiences are very similar. For example, | 
if an adult whose knowledge of French is small is travel- | 
ling in France he understands but little that is said— 
a word here and there stands out as familiar. His power | 
of expressing his wants is equally imperfect. His know- | 
ledge of French increases as, little by little, words and | 
phrases stand out more distinctly, and as their combina- 4 
tion and their reference to reality becomes clearer. This 1 
means a growth not merely in knowledge but in power | 
of action and of enjoyment so far as these depend on | 
intercourse with French people. But no new power has’ 
been born in him, nor has the number of French sounds 
which fall on his ear of necessity been increased. It is 
simply that his experience in this respect has resolved | 
       
    
        
   
   
-P-A-G-E-37
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 17 
itself moreand more into distinct elements, and that these 
more and more hold together in relations which have a 
meaning and, therefore, a value for him, in that they 
make clear experiences which before were confused. Of 
the same general order and character is the child’s 
acquirement of his mother-tongue. Further, the process 
is typical of all mental advance. For it shows us how 
experience is enriched by the separation and relation of 
elements, how this increases at once knowledge and 
power, and how the whole of the mental life is every- 
where in play in every step of the advance. 
. The study of children must, then, be approached with~~

children to be unprepared by any kind of pertiri 
knowledge. Now, the study of the inner life of anot| 
whether adult or child, is indirect. What is dire: 
given to the observer is conduct. Outwardly life 
presses itself in action and in speech, which is itself ak: 
of action. The psychological observer tries to gel 
the meaning of these outward manifestations. Onl, 
can he influence conduct by modifying motives, 
evoking purposes, and by all the other means which 
summed up in the word education. 
Now, the passage from outward conduct to inner 
meaning can only be mediated by a middle term which 
includes them both. That middle term each one of us 
can find only in himself. For each has a direct and 
immediate experience both of his own inner life and of 
the outward expression of that life. In that experience 
inner and outer are conjoined. But their relation is 
made explicit only when it is deliberately investigated.

18 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
One who has never been accustomed to ask why he 
acts in such and such ways is generally astonished, when 
he does make the enquiry, at the difficulty he finds in 
giving full and satisfactory answers. As that admirable 
philosopher, the late Master of Balliol eloquently tells 
us: ‘‘There is a strange mixture of the conscious and 
the unconscious in our mental history. Our life is not 
unconscious like the plants’; we see clearly what we are 
doing from day to day. We are aware always of the 
immediate interest that is occupying us, the immediate 
object we have in view. But we are seldom aware of 
the general current and tendency which these particular; 
acts are contributing to form within us. Each act, taken| 
by itself, does not seem of much importance. We seem. 
continually to be dealing with small details, and rarely, | 
if at all, with great and momentous issues.... The’ 
little exigencies of every day—whether we shall go tof 
see a particular friend, or read a particular book, ot 
devote particular time to this object or to that—it seems 
often indifferent whether we decide them in one way | 
the other; and often it is indifferent. But we are apt 
to forget that life masks its great issues under the appear’, 
ance of a series of unimportant circumstances and events; 
in each of which, however, there is some opportunity; 
for the exercise of courage or cowardice, truthfulness 0 
untruthfulness, magnanimity or meanness, justice of 
injustice, charity or uncharitableness, love or hated 
Steadily, silently, the inevitable process of change got 
on, and neither the individual himself, nor any of thos 
nearest to him may notice how, in the one case, hig 
character is being strengthened and elevated, and, in the 
other case, is being weakened and lowered. And theny 
if a great issue does come, and he is put to a decisive

trial, neither his friends nor he are able to comprehend 
how it is that, in the one case, he rises to the occasion 
and shows a strength and resource for which beforehand 
no one would have given him credit; or, in the other 
case, betrays a weakness and poverty of character, which 
no one, and he himself least of all, had suspected.” + 
The first step, then, on the road to becoming a psycho- 
logist is to obey the old adage “‘ Know thyself.” Truly, 
this is of little practical use in life unless it be conjoined 
with the yet more important command ‘‘ Govern thyself.” 
To know oneself weak in any point and yet to lack the 
self-control to adopt the means which will strengthen 
the weak place is evidently futile. Self-command, as 
well as self-knowledge, is required of one who would 
train others, for much of his training must work through 
example. Granting this, however, let us ask what is 
the kind of psychological knowledge that will be of most 
direct value in the study of children. 
Probably it will be agreed that the essential psycho- 
logical questions are—How did such and such an 
experience originate, and from what did it grow? 
What value has it in the present? What is likely to 
be its influence in the future? The adult must recognize 
that his experiences are not those of the child, but at 
the same time he knows that there has been no breach 
of continuity in his life since he was a baby. This means 
that his experiences have evolved from each other in an 
unbroken stream. Some had a very transitory effect, 
others have been much more enduring; some have 
proved fruitful of good, others of evil; some have 
affected his life in one way, others in different ways. 
Just as far as a man really understands this stream of

life which he calls himself, will he approach intelligently: 
the study of another stream of life of the same nature 
but of different composition and at a different part of | 
its course. He knows that when his experience is of a| 
particular kind his conduct shows certain characteristic, 
features, and as the former changes the latter is modified.’ 
He knows, for example, that certain modes of experience 
rouse his anger, and that anger always prompts him 
various expressive acts, though he may at times restrain| 
them. When he sees similar acts he infers anger in) 
another and he looks for its origin in experiences broadly 
analogous to his own. When he is interested in a pur| 
suit he gives time and energy to it. So when he sees 
a boy throwing himself energetically into some activity, 
he assumes the presence of an interest ; and, conversely 
he assumes the absence of interest when these outward 
signs are wanting. Such interpretations are, of cours 
only the first step. The really important enquiries c 
to the origin and the influence of the experience follow 
Sometimes we are told that a true educator “ putf 
himself in the place” of his pupils, ‘becomes a chilg 
among children.” This is surely a very foolish ang! 
perverse reading of psychology, though doubtleg 
inspired by the best of motives. If what has been sai 
is true it is evident that no adult can become a child 
among children or take a child’s point of view. if

itimpossible. One can no more hark back to the ment] 
than to the physical life of a child. And if one coulg 
one would, of course, in doing so, divest oneself of one 
character and office of educator. For a child does nf 
educate his fellows though he may influence them 
Education implies training, and that involves the actio
-P-A-G-E-41
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 21 
of the mature mind upon the immature. What is 
required is that the educator can appreciate the outlook 
of the child, can understand it and sympathize with it, 
but that, at the same time his own wider outlook shall 
enable him to use this childish experience as a stage in 
the continuous progress towards manhood, so that it may 
be neither wasted nor turned in a wrong direction. The 
educator must know both himself and his charges if he 
is to do the best educative work. That is the psycho- 
logical knowledge which he needs; without it, indeed, 
he is helpless. 
This leads to the consideration of a further important 
point. When one simply asks what is in one’s own 
mind, and tries to analyse it, one is shut up, as it were, 
in oneself. Here we meet another reason why the 
traditional theoretical psychology has been of so little 
service to education. ‘Till quite recently it has been 
essentially individualistic. From an individualistic 
psychology, indeed, the eighteenth century evolved a 
thoroughly individualistic theory of life and conduct, 
with ‘Liberty? as its watchword. The educational 
deduction was made by Rousseau, who aimed at pro- 
ducing a man independent of his fellows. The same 
theory still survives, though often strangely mixed with 
views of social relations which are quite inconsistent 
with it. 
When, however, one seeks to discover the origin, the 
growth, and the effect, of one’s experiences, one is led 
at once to constant and continual relations with the 
surrounding world of men and things. One finds that 
experiences of similar general character differ according 
as they are solitary or social; that, for instance, the 
pursuit of any purpose is fuller, stronger, more conscious,
-P-A-G-E-42
22 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
and less likely to be checked by doubts when it is under- 
taken in conjunction with a party or society organized 
for that end than when it is pursued alone. Thus we 
learn to look upon our experience as a relation between 
ourselves and our surroundings, and to realize the 
enormous influence the life around us has upon our 
thoughts, feelings, desires, and actions. So we are led 
to adopt a true attitude for the direction of the lives 
of others. For though education is in a sense a 
personal training, yet most of that training is given 
through groups and classes. Such groups may be a 
great help or a great hindrance to the personal influence 
of the schoolmaster. If he is wise they are the 
former ; just as, broadly, with wise parents a large family 
is a better educative organ than is a small one. But 
wisdom in this case means insight into the relations of 
individuals to groups—in a word, a grasp of social ot 
collective psychology. , This, again, is quite a new 
branch of investigation, and the study of its special 
reference to education has hardly been begun. 
Our argument has aimed at establishing that the work 
of education is always in fact based on psychology, 
though often implicitly ; that much of this psychology 
is unsuited for the purpose in that it is too intellectual 
istic, too individualistic, and gathered from analysis of 
the adult mind; that the psychology which is needed 
is genetic, in that it traces the gradual evolution and 
enrichment of experience, and social, in that it considers 
the common life of groups and the relations betweet. 
groups and individuals as well as the lives of individuals; 
that such a psychology is only in the making, but that 
many experienced educators have a great deal of this kind 
of knowledge which guides them in their work and is4
-P-A-G-E-43
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 23 
main reason of their success. Could these empirical 
and scattered pieces of knowledge be collected and col- 
lated a sure and long step would be taken in the formation 
of a body of theoretical educational psychology which 
would furnish a safe and pertinent propaedeutic to the 
actual study of children, and would regulate and enlighten 
that study itself. 
Pestalozzi’s desire “‘to psychologize education” is 
still far from being accomplished. But let us be quite 
clear as to what this should mean. It implies that the 
natural mental history of the child is known so that he 
may never be called upon to do anything which would 
hinder his growth and starve his experience, or any other 
thing which would be possible to him only if he had 
advanced to a further point than he has actually attained. 
It involves, too, that the educator secures that the child 
has all the kinds of experience necessary for his growth, 
and has them in the most fruitful way. But with more 
than this psychology cannot deal. It is, therefore, a 
grave error to speak of education as merely ‘applied 
psychology.? Such exaggerated claims do not dispose 
those who are already prejudiced against everything 
which is called psychology to think more favourably of 
its advocates. 
( A merely psychological education is really a contra- 
diction i in terms, for it would leave the child to develop 
freely as a wild animal. “Psychology can say nothing 
as to what is good and what is bad., For it, as a natural 
science, facts exist, but they are “in no wise valued. 
Psychology has no moral preferences. Its scientific 
interest is as much excited by monstrous moral depravity 
as by saintly holiness. For it they are equally forms of 
experience. Not psychology but ethics condemns the
-P-A-G-E-44
24 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
one and approves the other. ( Psychology, therefore, can | 
say nothing as to the ultimate question of education 
that of end to be sought. 
Such considerations show us the futility of defining 
education in psychological terms, as, for instance, ‘the 
harmonious development of all the powers of the child” 
In the first place, ‘harmonious’ is a vague and ambiguous 
term, and, consequently, it presents no definite aim ; and, 
in the second place, ‘development? is devoid of any real 
meaning. For a power may be developed in a variety 
of ways, and many of these we condemn as immoral. 
We do not, for example, wish to develop a child’s intel- 
lectual powers so that he becomes a skilful forger or 
a promoter of bubble companies, nor his power of self- 
assertion till it appears in bullying and tyranny, and, 
perhaps, finds its fruition in murder; nor his power of 
emotion so that he grows up a sentimentalist or a man 
dominated by his passions. It may be objected that 
none of these cases would show a ‘ harmonious’ develop- 
ment ; but this is not obvious. The murderer may plan 
his crime astutely and may be urged towards it by feelings 
and emotions which are well under control. The 
sensualist may have persuaded himself that in sensuality 
is to be found the greatest pleasure, and that to get as 
much pleasure as possible is the real aim of life ; to that 
he may skilfully address both his will and his intellect. 
If, then, such development be condemned as wanting 
in harmony, it is because under that term there is tacitly, 
and perhaps unconsciously, introduced the idea of har- 
mony with established standards; that is, of harmony 
with something outside and independent of the indi- 
vidual life. This is obviously a very different thing 
from harmony among the several elements of that life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 25 
‘Harmonious development? may also be interpreted 
—and often is interpreted—to refer to a kind of typical 
‘well-balanced’ or ‘well-proportioned’ mind, in which 
no power stands out prominently. That a large number 
of such minds are desirable in the interests of social 
stability may be granted. But it may also be urged that 
nature is never likely to fail in the production of 
mediocrities. Such minds, however, do little for human 
progress. ‘‘ A plain man is very much like a plain cook, 
unable to cope successfully with anything beyond the 
commonplace.”? All the great achievements of man- 
kind have been due to men whose minds were in this 
sense ill-proportioned. ‘‘Genius is akin to insanity” 
expresses just this fact that some one power or set of 
powers dominates the life, and is not tied down by other 
powers. Of course there is a limit beyond which this 
one-sided ruling of the life is good neither for the indi- 
vidual nor for the community. But it by no means 
follows that an educator is justified in attempting to 
stunt the growth of some special power for fear it should 
tun to excess. It is not the task of education to deprive 
the world of its geniuses, its heroes, and its saints. ‘‘A 
well-proportioned mind is one which shows no particular 
bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never 
cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured 
as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer. Also, on the 
other hand, that it will never cause him to be applauded 
as a prophet, revered as a priest, or exalted as a king. 
Its usual blessings are happiness and mediocrity. It 
produces the poetry of Rogers, the paintings of West, 
the statecraft of North, the spiritual guidance of Sumner; 
enabling its possessors to find their way to wealth, to

wind up well, to step with dignity off the stage, to die 
comfortably in their beds, and to get the decent monu- 
ment which, in many cases, they deserve. It never 
would have allowed Yeobright to do such a ridiculous 
thing as throw up his business to benefit his fellow- 
creatures.””* 
As psychology cannot decide the end of education it 
is, of course, unable to evaluate the means. It may 
show us that a child is actually interested in this or that, - 
or make it probable that in such and such a way his 
interest will be aroused. But as to whether it is well | 
that he should be so interested psychology isdumb. For 
guidance as to the kinds of experiences he should try 
to induce in his pupils the educator must seek elsewhere. - 
To look to psychology leads directly back to the training | 
of individual faculties. 
Nor can psychology dictate the method of teaching, 
that is, of leading a child into an experience. It is, 
indeed, fashionable to say that teaching method should 
not be logical but psychological. This is pure muddle- 
headedness. Every process of thought is a fact in 
mental life, and is, therefore, a fact for psychology. If 
the reasoning be bad the fact may, indeed, be psychologi- 
cally more interesting than if it be good; for then both 
the passage of thought by which the conclusion is reached 
and the origin of the error have to be investigated, and 
the psychological problem is so far a richer one. But 
the intellectual aim of teaching is to train in correct 
thought and in the legitimate use of evidence. This, 
of course, is logical, ‘Logical? does not denote one 
kind of thought-process and ‘ psychological’ another and 
opposed process. All thought is ‘psychological’; the 
1 Thomas Hardy : The Return of the Native, Bk. iii. ch. 2. 
J
-P-A-G-E-47
EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY 27 
aim of teaching is to give it the further quality of 
‘logical? Psychology, therefore, can neither lay down 
methods nor test their results. All it can do is to help 
the teacher to decide what kind of logical thought he 
may expect pupils of a certain age and advancement to 
be capable of experiencing. 
Method in teaching, then, must be in harmony with 
the forms of mental activity appropriate to the particular 
pupils, but it must also be an orderly process towards 
a pre-determined end ; an end which must be felt to be 
of worth by the pupils, or there will be no real process 
on their part. Hence, the teacher cannot teach effectively 
unless he can set before himself the pupils’ process of 
thought in each piece of learning. Here is the great 
difference in attitude of pupils and teacher towards any 
lesson or set of lessons—the pupils think the matter 
under consideration, the teacher thinks the pupils’ process 
of thought in thinking that matter. ‘This thinking of 
the teacher is both psychological and logical. It is 
psychological, in that he has to grasp Aow the pupils 
think ; it is logical, in that his aim is so to direct the 
pupils’ activity that, out of the many ways in which they 
could think the object, they do think it in one which 
will lead to systematized experience. In brief, the 
teacher has to plan how to incite his pupils to a logical 
train of thought, and this obviously demands that the 
teacher knows both the character of such a train and the 
possibilities of this pupils in that respect. But it further 
implies that he knows what mental processes in himself 
will excite the desired process in his pupils. This also 
is psychological knowledge, for it is insight into the 
relation of mind to mind. The teacher, then, first thinks 
the steps to be taken by the pupils and then he so adjusts
-P-A-G-E-48
28 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
the external means of teaching, of which the chief is 
himself, that the pupils actually take such steps. He 
applies his psychology and his logic both in preparing 
his lessons and in giving them. 
Education, then, should use psychology but not be | 
limited by it, for the very purpose of education is to 
interfere with natural development so as to secure a 
richer experience and a fuller exercise of the higher 
powers. Such interference should be guided by psycho- 
logical knowledge, or it is likely to stunt growth instead 
of promoting it. But to make education mainly a 
looking on while the child follows. his spontaneous 
impulses is to condemn him to reach but a low stage of 
development. The child’s spontaneity is the beginning 
of activities which it is the function of education to make 
more definite and more persevering than they would be , 
if left undirected and uncontrolled. The difference 
between a cultured man and one of the same time and 
country who is uncultured is due to differences in the 
amount and kind of directive influences which have 
been brought to bear. Psychology is quite unable to 
explain it.
-P-A-G-E-49
CHAPTER II 
STUDY OF MENTAL LIFE 
Ir is not in giving rules or directions for specific edu- 
cative: processes that psychology has its value for the 
teacher. The book which sandwiches educational plati- 
tudes between mental analyses, and describes the result 
as specially adapted for teachers is, indeed, still with us, 
and is responsible for not a little of that hostile attitude 
of the practical teacher towards psychology which we 
have lamented. For these commonplaces of the school- 
room really owe their being about as much—and as 
little—to the psychological analyses as, when they 
appeared in the Didactica Magna of Comenius, they did 
to the wonderful analogies, such as hatching an egg, 
with which that writer connected them. If psychology 
can give the educator no more than this he cannot be 
blamed for pursuing more profitable studies. 
But if, as I have argued, every true educator is always 
making use of real psychology then the value of a 
theoretical study of that subject is apparent. It will 
guide the beginner and be a help to the experienced. 
Of course the study of books is not enough. ‘‘ Books 
are only the gloss of life, they are not the text. Its 
secrets must be read in the living world, with much pain 
and sleeplessness and wearied eyes.”? Reading and 
IW. J. Locke: 4 the Gate of Samaria, ch. 9.

30 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
reflexion will no more make a psychologist than a 
physician or an engineer. But as these are welcomed 
as preliminaries and auxiliaries in the latter cases so they 
will be, when rightly conceived, in the former. It is 
true that a complete genetic psychology cannot yet be 
produced, but neither can a complete treatise on medicine 
or on engineering. In every department of human 
knowledge and practice advance is possible and is desired. 
But such advance must start from the standpoint already 
reached. As the would-be physician learns what he can 
from books as well as from hospital practice, so should 
the would-be educator. In the one case as in the other 
a few will make discoveries and push forward the 
boundaries of knowledge. The many, who are not the 
original minds, will apply the knowledge gained in their 
daily practice, and will at least try to keep abreast of the 
advances made by others. 
It is true, as we have claimed, that many experienced 
teachers attain much psychological knowledge with- 
out any study of books. But are there not yet more 
whose life-long experience in school has never given 
them a glimpse into the real lives of those whom they 
are claiming to educate ; who remain to the end what 
they were at the beginning, external forces striving to 
form the young life, and succeeding only in deforming 
it? 
In reading a book on psychology it is absolutely 
necessary that the reader test every one of its discus- 
sions by examination of his own consciousness. It is 
further advisable, not only for the sake of checking 
the results of his own introspection, but also as a first 
step in observation of the lives of others, that he should 
compare his results with those of other workers. A 
a
-P-A-G-E-51
STUDY OF MENTAL LIFE 31 
small group of fellow-students working in this way 
makes surer and quicker advance than would be possible 
to their isolated efforts. From such work they should 
amongst other things have made clear to themselves what 
is the true force of such words as ‘interest,’ ‘attention,’ 
‘memory, ‘desire, ‘purpose’—terms continually used 
in educational writings and discussions, and too often 
employed confusedly and ambiguously. They should 
also have discovered the general conditions under which 
such aspects of mental life show themselves, and in what 
way they affect one’s relation to the things around one. 
When the educator wants to use the psychological 
knowledge obtained by self-examination and reading to 
give insight into the mental life of a child, he is obviously 
dealing with a life which, in many essentials, is different 
from his own. A further step in his preparation, there- 
fore, is to recall as clearly and precisely as possible 
temembrances of his childhood and youth, and to see 
how they are related to what he has discovered of his 
adult experiences and how the latter have gradually 
sevolved, from them. — 
This also gives a clue which will help him when he 
tries to foresee the results of certain of his efforts, though 
such prediction is peculiarly liable to error. A subject 
of study which attracts one boy may repel another, an 
exertion of influence which in one case is thankfully 
received may in another case be resented. General 
psychology, even when enlightened by intimate know- 
ledge of his own life, can do little more than make him 
aware of these divergent possibilities. No doubt, in 
dealing with groups and classes the average result can 
be more frequently anticipated, for the opposed effects 
may be discounted or may even counterbalance each
-P-A-G-E-52
32 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
other. But even here we can look but a little way ahead. 
For this takes us into the nearly untrodden realm of 
social psychology. There the problems are evidently of 
the utmost difficulty and complexity. ‘‘I need not say,” 
remarks Leslie Stephen, ‘‘how shortsighted are the 
ablest statesmen, and how constantly that which happens 
is precisely the one thing which nobody foresaw, but 
which, after the event, appears to have been just what 
every one should have foreseen... Will the increase 
of knowledge make men content or ‘discontented ? ? Will 
it confirm or shake the beliefs upon which the social order 
sélf-i ues and weaken the bonds of discipline? If 
we can give some vague answer to such questions it is 
clearly not such an answer as can be called scientific, or 
as enables us to give any definite prediction of results.”? 
{Every beginner in psychology, then, must start with 
an examination of his own conscious experience. This 
involves analysis, but the object of the analysis is to 
trace back each form of complex experience so as to 
discover which are the simpler elements ; that is, which 
show most distinctly in earlier forms of the process. For 
the educator the main interest is in the course of mental 
life. Nor need analysis be pushed into the minute detail 
which is so valuable and necessary for the pure psycho- 
logist.“/By such tracing backwards of his own life the 
future educator will best fit himself to observe and under- 
stand the reverse process in the lives of his charges. 
What would each one of us name as the essentially 
human element in human life? What raises man in 
kind above the lower animals? Certainly not the powers

of sight or smell or hearing or physical strength or 
endurance. In all of these he is easily surpassed by 
eagle, by dog, by deer, by elephant, by camel, and by 
many other animals. Surely it is in the > guiding of 
gonduct by intelligence and will. If we examine this 
we find it means that we are able to set up before our- 
selves in imagination a more or less distant end towards 
which we feel emotionally drawn—that is, we have a 
sense of its value for us—so that we are not content to 
rest as we are without making effort to attain it; and 
that we have, as a result of past experience, such a 
knowledge of the mode of action pertinent to the case, 
and of the possibilities of pursuing such a course, having 
regard to the actions of others, the nature of the physical 
conditions, and our own powers, that we can plan the 
means to reach our end and fulfil our purpose. 
Into the actual attainment there enter other factors. 
Many a course of action thus planned fails because of 
want of perseverance and staying power; or because of 
inability or “unwillingness to bear discomfort, to over- 
come opposition, or to surmount difficulties due to the 
stubbornness of the physical things we have to use or 
to our own want of skill in managing them. 
This last named characteristic of our actions—skill— 
taises a further analytic question as to its nature and 
origin. Let each reader take any acquired aptitude— 
¢g. power to play the piano, to write, to skate, to. dance, 
to ride a bicycle—which he can plainly remember learn- 
ing. Let him recall the process as clearly as he 
can. He will find that at first his whole will was fixed 
and his whole attention concentrated on the various 
details of the required movements, and that even so 
they were not successfully made. But this means that 
Ww. c
-P-A-G-E-54
34 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
movements other than those desired were made instead, 
In other words, though the main idea of purpose was 
plain, the intellectual organization of means was imper- 
fect, and the physical co-ordination of movements was 
more imperfect still’ Now, when this is compared with 
the carrying out of the process after skill is acquired it 
becomes apparent that all this detail which took up so 
much attention has become automatic, or nearly so. The 
skilled pianist reads the notes, and his fingers strike the 
keys without any definite attention being given to their 
movements; indeed, such attention will be found to 
disorganize them. The bicyclist steers his course with 
his eye on the road, and avoids obstacles and turns 
corners without thinking of the complex and co-ordinated 
movements of legs, arms, and body which cause the 
machine to obey his will. 
Having carried our minds backwards step by step 
from the present to the very beginning of a special 
acquirement, by reversing the process we set before our- 
selves a picture of the mode by which every child has to 
learn to do such things, and we see that it is only by 
carrying out such an analysis in each case as far as we caf 
that we are in a position to observe intelligently the early 
stages in the acquirement by the child. | Certainly much 
has been done in observation of the very earliest years of 
childhood, and of the facts recorded we can avail our- 
selves; but we should always interpret them by what 
introspective memory reveals to us of our own beginnings. 
And always we should keep to the only safe rule that when- 
ever the assumption of a more elementary mental process 
is sufficient to explain the observed facts we are not justi- 
fied in assuming a more complex pfocess, even though 
that might be the true explanation in our own adult life.

Though, however, we may claim that rational regula- 
tion of life is the essential human characteristic, yet not 
much study of our own life is required to show us that 
this quality is by no means always apparent. We have 
already seen that even when we are following a course 
laid down by reason the executive processes have become 
mechanical. I wish to refer to a book on the shelves: I 
get up, walk across the room and fetch it, my thoughts 
fixed all the time on the point on which I am about to 
consult it, not at all on the bodily movements I make. 
This is obvious, but educationally it rather needs insist- 
ing on, because the reaction against unintelligent learning 
has shown signs of undervaluing the automatic element 
which is so important in all the executive activities of life. 
One cannot easily express one’s thoughts in writing, for 
example, unless one can form the words automatically, 
and this involves both writing and spelling ; one cannot 
develop mathematical relations if one has to attend to 
the simple arithmetical processes. Often a child is 
hindered in progress because he has not made the spelling 
of ordinary words, or the multiplication tables, automatic. 
So far from executive automatism being opposed to 
intelligent regulation of life it is its indispensable 
condition. 
Only self-examination, however, will bring home to 
any one how large a part of his life has become a routine 
business into which intellect enters at the most to deter- 
mine subordinate steps. The end is fixed, and so are the 
general means. A teacher goes almost automatically to 
school and passes through the arranged routine without 
continually deliberating whether to do the one or the 
other. Obviously, this too is good; for it leaves free 
all his powers to do well the actual work in hand. The
-P-A-G-E-56
36 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
end was decided when he determined to become a teacher, 
the routine when he drew out the time-table. If he is 
wise he gave much earnest consideration to both these 
points. . 
The intellectual regulation of life, therefore, is seen 
not to mean the continual deciding on each particular 
action. That would, indeed, be an ineffective life, partly 
because it would accomplish so little as each step would 
be delayed, and partly because what it did accomplish 
would not be related as a systematized set of efforts. It 
means the deciding of purposes—some wide as life, others 
subordinate though related to these most embracing ones; 
the devising of means ; the carrying out of those means 
as efficiently as possible. And when the maximum of 
such efficiency is reached all that is mechanical is left to 
an acquired automatism. The function of intellect is to 
make use of its tools, not to be continually forging them. 
It is quite possible, then, for an adult life to be asa 
whole rationally directed ; but such possibility necessi- 
tates that the dominant purpose, or harmonious purposes, 
of life have been cordially accepted, and that there is 
sufficient strength to keep broadly and generally to their 
pursuit. Can it be affirmed that this is descriptive even 
of the majority of adults? Have many persons the 
wide and comprehensive outlook on life which is implied? 
Have many sufficient strength of purpose to keep for 
long to the path they have traced out for themselves? 
Each reader must apply such enquiries to himself, and 
if he would make any advance in psychology he must 
answer them honestly. He may find that he has such 
purposes, but that they are ‘castles in Spain,’ and that his 
actual life is determined by much more immediate con- 
siderations. Or he may find that he has lived on from
-P-A-G-E-57
STUDY OF MENTAL LIFE 37 
childhood without ever having given serious thought to 
what his life as a whole is to mean, content to do the task 
and to seize the pleasure immediately to hand. 
Whatever he may now be able to say of himself, 
according to our plan he must carry his thoughts back 
into the past. Starting from the present, after he has 
distinguished his purposes let him go on to enquire when 
and how those purposes began to take form, whence they 
were derived, what vicissitudes in influencing his life 
they have undergone. Has one of them grown up with 
his growth, unnoticed and perhaps unsuspected, till now 
this introspection has brought it to light as one of the 
dominant factors in his life? If so, can he trace it back 
to the influences exerted on him by parents, relatives, 
and friends? Did another spring up, as it were full- 
grown and armed, as the result of an inspiration received 
at some specific time from book or lesson or suggestion? 
Not that he is to expect to find the same purposes, 
originating in the same way, in those whose lives he 
will try to understand, but that he may appreciate the 
various possibilities of the genesis of life’s influences. 
This enquiry will surely bring to light the fact that, 
however wide and comprehensive his present purposes 
may be, they were not always thus. They have been 
gradually evolved, and, doubtless, he can go back in 
memory to a time when he had no purposes which were 
not bounded by the immediate future. Much earnest 
thought and careful separation of actual remembrance 
ftom flattering imagination is necessary before any adult 
succeeds in laying before himself anything like an 
accurate map, even in outline, of the purposes of his 
life up to the present, tracing them back like rivers to 
their sources, showing how, when, and why, they united,
-P-A-G-E-58
38 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
became larger, stronger, and more absorbing, till they 
have reached the present point, which itself is not the end 
of their course. 
In such an examination of one’s past life one becomes 
aware that at no time has there been a thorough-going 
co-ordination and combination of purposes. Many have 
referred to the present or to the very immediate future 
and have, indeed, scarcely been consciously adopted at 
all. The apprehension of the result and of the means 
is sufficient by itself to evoke the action, provided there 
bea sufficient spring of emotion behind it. Such actions 
we call impulsive, and most people do many impulsive 
actions to the end of their lives. Well that it is so. 
For when such deeds spring from warm and kindly affec- 
tions they have a geniality which is apt to evaporate 
during a protracted process of intellectual deliberation. 
Moreover, immediacy is often essential to the beneficent 
effect of the act. 
The motive power, then, in an impulsive act is an 
emotion raised by some immediate perception, together 
with an equally immediate apprehension of the action 
which will meet the situation. For example, I see 4 
child in danger of being run over in the street ; im 
pulsively I rush forward to drag him back to safety. 
But impulses do not always tend to deeds with happy 
results. JI am angered and I impulsively strike a blow 
of which the effect may be the serious injury, or ever 
the death, of the offender. In such a case the impulsive 
act is probably felt at once to be in opposition to a much 
wider life-purpose, and there follows remorse. In the 
future I am likely to abstain from blows when roused 
to sudden anger. As we should say, I have learned mj 
lesson. Of course, each reader must analyse a numbet
-P-A-G-E-59
STUDY OF MENTAL LIFE 39 
of impulsive experiences of his own, and note carefully 
the various modes in which many of them are checked. 
What, then, do we find has happened in our own 
lives? Surely this, that as life goes on there is a con- 
tinually increasing regulation of impulses. We still feel 
the emotion, we still see the direct means to express it, but 
often we inhibit that expression inoutwardact. We shall 
do well to give some time to studying the part played 
by this process of inhibition in our lives, for inkibition 
is nothing but self-control. Such an investigation soon 
brings out that inhibition is itself an activity; that is, 
it is a putting forth of energy. We inhibit the hasty 
blow in anger. How is this marked? Is it not by 
clenched fists, tightly locked jaws, and a general tension 
of muscles similar to what we find when we are resisting 
a physical force? If we ask ourselves why this effort 
is made we find the answer to be—because there is 
dominant in our minds an idea contrary to the impulse 
and stronger than it. It may be a feeling of former, 
or even present, affection towards the person who has 
roused our anger, in which case one impulse meets and 
conquers another: both are on the same plane. Such 
inhibition, however, could never be more than occasional 
and uncertain. The more important cases are those in 
which the opposed idea is of a wider and deeper character 
—that is, touches more of life—than the impulse. Such 
may be an idea of duty, or of prudence, or of regard 
for personal dignity. 
If we then ask ourselves whence came these wider 
ideas we shall discover that we owe them mainly to the 
teaching and guidance of others. They were at first 
Imposed on us, but we have accepted them, passively 
perhaps ; at any rate we have allowed them to influence
-P-A-G-E-60
40 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
us. In other words, the regulation of impulse is mainly 
due to education. Those who have been allowed to 
follow their own ‘spontaneity’ from infancy remain the 
creatures of impulse throughout life, unless, indeed, they 
are those exceptional natures in which there is an 
unusually strong personality which works out its own 
salvation. 
Our investigation into our own experience will, how- 
ever, bring to light yet a third ruler of conduct, which 
we all know as instinct. Often, indeed, we use the 
adjective ‘instinctive’ to characterize many of those 
automatic executive activities of which mention has been 
made, or to denote impulsive actions. We say, for 
example, that we instinctively turned to the left when 
riding a bicycle, or that we instinctively rushed forward 
to drag a child from danger in the street. So too acts 
are at times spoken of as instinctive which are mere 
physical reflexes, such as winking the eyes at the near 
approach of any object. In all such cases ‘instinctive’ 
is used as synonymous with ‘immediate, and simply 
implies the absence of deliberation. 
There is, however, a more exact use of the term to 
which we shall do well to confine ourselves—a usage 
which limits instincts to specific tendencies which are 
part of the original nature of all men. They are born 
in us in the sense that they do not owe their origin to 
our experience, but certainly not in the sense that they 
are in full’operation at birth.} In such endowment nian 
at first sight shows inferior td the lower animals. Their 
instincts guide their conduct very soon and very com- 
pletely. This is not, however, because man is inferior 
to them in instinct, but because he is superior in reasop-

brought out by Wundt: “‘Suppose a bird were to 
become interested in zoological investigation ; he might 
well regard, mankind as the richest of all creatures in 
instincts. Man shares with the birds the instinct to live 
in wedlock ; like the fox, he educates his children ; he 
has the beaver’s impulse to build houses, and the bee’s 
custom of founding states and sending forth colonies ; 
while he has in common with the ant.a-pleasure in war,

Man’s instincts, however, develop slowly and in con- 
hexion with his powers of thought and understanding, 
so that they can be held in subjection, modified, and 
utilized. (Instincts are thus the servants of man while 
they are the masters of the lower animals.| In examining 
our experience we continually find an instinctive basis, 
which we detect by*the impossibility, so to say, of 
imagining any other kind of response to the situation. 
At the same time we find that this instinctive basis is 
continually so adapted as to fit in with our designs and 
purposes. The simpler and more immediately organic 
instincts, such as hunger, we find operative in every part 
of our experience, and we recognize that we can control 
even an instinct so fundamental to the preservation of 
life by a regard for the rights of property. That is, 
instinct, like impulse, can be subordinated to wide 
tegulative ideas. Another fundamental instinct—that 
of sex—develops at such a time of life that adults can 
recall with considerable accuracy its beginnings and 
development, as well as examine the mental states and 
tendencies to which it gives rise—the way in which it 
influences thoughts and imagination and prompts to

42 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
action for its satisfaction. Here again introspection 
shows the possibility of checking the action, and even 
of diverting the thoughts and imaginings, and may also 
bring home the difficulty of doing so—a difficulty 
undoubtedly felt more by some natures than by others. 
Further, examination of such instincts will lay bare 
how strong a part emotion plays in an instinct, and how 
in instinctive action it is not our reason but a felt organic 
need which dictates the end. We may use intelligence 
in planning means for the gratification of the instinct 
if such means are not immediately available. Or we 
may deny it satisfaction, when our whole strength has 
to be exerted to turn the energy of life into another 
channel. 
In an endeavour to discover which of our emotional 
tendencie§ are instinctive we cannot be sure of absolute 
success. Still, ‘the quest is its own reward, for in that 
“way alone shall we reach an understanding of the causes 
of special emotions, and of their relations to each other. 
Those which we find composite—as, for example, 
revenge, which involves both anger and desire for retalie- 
tion, if not also hatred—are, of course, not instinctive. 
Our aim is to reach those elements which will not yield 
to further analysis. Every step in our enquiry, when 
tested by our own remembered experience, shows us 
that many emotions are only possible to adult life, 
others to adolescence, others again to late boyhood and 
girlhood. Only the simplest and most direct are possible 
to early childhood. If those we reach in our analysis 
are not all absolutely instinctive, yet they are, at any 
rate, likely to be of so simple a nature that they may be 
expected to show themselves in the lives of even the 
youngest children who attend school.
-P-A-G-E-63
STUDY OF MENTAL LIFE 43 
So far we have tried to trace backwards in retro- 
spection the springs of our conduct and the way in which 
it is regulated, and we have made clear to ourselves that 
the further we go back the less share reason and intelli- 
gence have in the matter. (Intelligence can only grow 
through a relation of understanding with men and things 
around us, and this is acquired gradually. It is the 
special function of teaching to help to develop it. ; If 
we ask how intelligence does direct our actions we’ may 
make clear to ourselves the real nature of knowledge. 
We may also bring home to our convictions that much 
of what is commonly called knowledge is mere erudition 
which has no bearing of any kind on life, whether 
practical, intellectual, artistic, moral, or religious. I 
believe it is only when a teacher recognizes by investi- 
gation of his own experience that much which he has 
learnt has neither enriched nor guided his life that he 
will address himself seriously to eliminating from his 
own teaching all such useless lumber. 
Turning, then, to the real knowledge he has acquired, 
it is essential that he should find out how it developed 
in his own life. For, as Bacon says, the teacher’s task 
is t “transplant knowledge into the scholar’s mind as 
it grew in his own.” } He may take any typical pieces 
of knowledge—gathered from direct observation and 
thought, from books, from reasoning—and in each case 
ask himself what activity of his own was concerned and 
what part that activity played in the acquisition ; whether 
the knowledge would have been more real and-effective, 
or the acquirement more rapid, had other forms of 
personal activity been brought into action; what share 
was taken by his teacher. In such a determination he 
should at each point consider whether a change of
-P-A-G-E-64
44 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
emphasis or proportion would have improved the result. 
He may, for example, in the case he is investigating 
find that his teacher actually gave him a great deal of 
1:8 help and guidance. He should then try to decide how 
_amuch of that was necessary, how much not actually 
+" necessary but decidedly acceptable and helpful. All 
: the rest he may mark as mistaken zeal, and try to 
f, avoid similar errors in his own dealings with his 
"pupils. 
In such enquiries as these he will find comparison 
with the results of others similarly engaged not so much 
useful as indispensable. For we do not all learn alike, 
and we are apt to think wedo. To take what is certainly 
one of the most commonly ignored points of difference. 
Some people build up, retain, and recall much of their 
knowledge in the form of vivid mental pictures. They 
see the scene described, the Page of the book on which 
the mathematical problem is worked, the map of the 
country. They are apt to believe that all other people 
do the same, and to base much of their teaching on that 
supposition. For example, this assumption underlies 
what is known as the Gouin method of teaching foreign 
languages. But the assumption is not true. Many 
people can only visualize dimly, some not at all. I 
generally find at least half of a class of university 
students among the former, and I myself belong to 
the Jatter. The common tendency to assume that 
others are mentally like oneself was charmingly illus- 
trated by the artless enquiry made of me in private, and 
in all good faith, by a student after a class-discussion 
in which I had confessed and tried to explain my 
deficiency in this respect: ‘“ But, Professor, you cam 
think, can’t you?” So by consultation the student will
-P-A-G-E-65
STUDY OF MENTAL LIFE 45 
find that there is individuality in learning as in other 
forms of human activity, and he will endeavour to adapt 
his teaching so as to catch all in his net. 
If one approach the examination of mental life in 
this way one is not in danger of ignoring the all- 
important fact that real learning is. only-_possible.through 
sclf-activity. And self-activity is activity directed by 
pupose and prompted by desire. This general attitude 
towards the subject studied is what is properly called 
interest? Let the reader ask himself what he really 
means when he says he is interested in this or that. Is 
it pleasure? or amusement? or entertainment? When 
am I interested in solving a problem? Surely, defore 
Thave solved it. And if I am really interested in the 
thing at all, my state of mind during the solution is 
one of unrest and tension, by no means one of quiescence 
and enjoyment. I keep on because I value and desire 
the end, not because I enjoy the means. If I do enjoy 
them so much to the good, but really the matter affects 
me but little. 
That, the reader will agree, is interest in adult life. 
Let him now look back, calling to mind the pursuits 
which engrossed—that is, interested—him in earlier 
years. Let him make clear their nature and their relation 
to his life at the time. In a word, let him ask why he 
was interested in them. Let him then consult with 
others who have made similar private investigations. 
There can be little doubt that he will then appreciate 
the fundamental difference between ‘making lessons 
interesting to children, and making the children inter- 
ested in the subjects on which the lessons are given. 
Further, he will have gained some accurate, if not 
adequate, idea of the kinds of pursuits into which
-P-A-G-E-66
46 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
children at various ages throw themselves most whole- 
heartedly. 
I hope I have succeeded in making clear what is the 
kind of introspection that is helpful to one who is aboutto 
enter on a study of the main lines of mental develop- 
ment. It must be a preliminary to such study, or the 
knowledge derived from books will be mere erudition, 
not a living influence in the work of education. But 
it is not done once for all. Thetrue psychologist never 
ceases to look within himself for help in understanding 
others. Always it is introspection into life, and conse- 
quently it is mainly of the nature of retrospection over 
the past. Not, however, of fixed points in the past— 
“mental states? as they are called—but always into the 
living process of growing experience. One must con- 
stantly bear in mind the fundamental character of mental 
life. ‘It does not consist in the connexion of unalter- 
able objects and varying conditions: in all its phases it 
is process ; an active, not a passive, existence: develp- 
ment, not stagnation. The understanding of the basa 
laws of this development is the final goal of psycho- logy.” 1 
The psychological equipment of an educator is evi 
dently a task of much difficulty. But if the reader be 
convinced that such preparation will vastly contribute 
towards efficiency he will surely not shrink from the 
strenuous and deep thinking which it demands. 
Everything which throws light on mental life will be 
welcomed, whether it appear under the name of psycho- 
logy or not. Indeed more real insight of the kind the 
educator needs is often to be obtained from such a pro- 
found study of human character and motive as The Egoist 
1Wundt : Op. cit. p. 454.
-P-A-G-E-67
STUDY OF MENTAL LIFE 47 
of George Meredith than from works on abstract analytic 
psychology. 
Nor will the fact that, after all, the best psychological 
knowledge he can gain is imperfeet-and-full of gaps and 
obscurities discourage him As Froude puts it: “Our 
knowledge of any man is always-inadequate—even of 
the unit which each of us calls himself; and the first 
condition under which we can know a man at all is, that 
he be in essentials something like ourselves; that our 
own experience be an interpreter which shall open the 
secrets of his experience; and it often happens, even 
among our contemporaries, that we are altogether baffled. 
The Englishman and the Italian may understand each 
other’s speech, but the language of each other’s ideas 
has still to be learnt. Our long failures in Ireland have 
risen from a radical incongruity of character which has 
divided the Celt from the Saxon. And again, in the 
same country, the Catholic will be a mystery to the 
Protestant, and the Protestant to the Catholic. ‘Their 
intellects have been shaped-in-oppasite moulds; they 
are like instruments which cannot be played in concert.” * 
The educator will recognize not only that suéh imper- 
fection in knowledge of others is inevitable, but that we 
should not desire to have so thorough an insight into 
the lives of our children that nothing lay hid from us. 
Tn every soul there are sacred recesses into which the 
intrusion of even the most sympathetic friend is a pro- 
fanation. Such knowledge as will make us serviceable 
we do well to seek, but to that we should limit our 
desires. 
This raises in many minds an objection to a method 
1The Dissolution of the Monasteries in Short Studies on Great Subjects, 
vol. i. p. 407.
-P-A-G-E-68
48 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
of trying to gain general knowledge of the inner lives 
of children and young people by getting a large number 
of them to answer_sets.of “qtiéstions. Great care is 
certainly needed when such a procedure is followed that 
the questions are such as a stranger has a right to ask, 
such as can be answered without morbid introspection, 
such as give no temptation to posing, and such as are 
not likely to yield answers vitiated by imperfections of 
memory. Great caution is also demanded in drawing 
inductions from the answers to decide whether they come 
from really typical young people or whether the replies 
of those who are somewhat excessively emotional, if not 
morbid, preponderate. Many of the researches on 
adolescence which have been made by this method seem 
peculiarly open to these objections. 
But probably the educator to whom this book appeals 
will leave such investigations to those who have more 
leisure than himself. Nor is it likely that he will takea 
personal part in the experiments of a psychological labora- 
tory. He will welcome any fresh light which may come 
to him from either of these modes of enquiry, or fromany 
other which psychologists may invent. But his own 
energies will be directed to gaining a serviceable know- 
ledge of his own charges by observation of their daily life 
both as individuals and in the communities of class and 
school. Were he to publish the results of such study in 
educational journals or as monographs both a rapid anda 
safe advance in educational psychology might confidently 
be anticipated.
-P-A-G-E-69
CHAPTER III 
BODILY ENDOWMENT 
Tur most obvious thing about ourselves is that we each 
have both a body and a mind or soul. Common speech, 
indeed, often distinguishes further between mind and 
soul, using the former term to denote our intellect— 
that is, our power to think, reason, and the like, and 
restricting the latter to our higher and more spiritual” 
selves—our ability to love and seek the good. Some- 
times the division is expressed differently, and man is 
divided into body, soul, and spirit, where soul seems 
to correspond with ‘mind’, and spirit with ‘soul’, of 
the former distinction. Psychology, however, needs no 
such three-fold division. For it ‘soul? or ‘mind’ is 
indifferently the name of all in human nature that is not 
body. 
Philosophers have disputed for thousands of years as 
to the ultimate nature of both soul and body, and as to 
the relation of those ultimate natures to each other. 
Into such metaphysical questions—profoundly interest- 
ing as they are—there is no need for us to enter. We 
know quite well enough for the purposes of education 
what we mean by mind and what by body. We find 
ho practical difficulty in drawing the line between them, 
and we recognize that, whatever may be the meta- 
physical explanation, mind and body, as given in direct 
w D
-P-A-G-E-70
s0 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
experience, act upon each other. Our wishes are carried 
out through bodily actions; our feelings are shown in 
gesture and facial expression ; sudden violent emotion 
may kill; long continued thinking makes us bodily tired 
and, it may be, gives us a headache ; bodily fatigue due 
to physical exertion unfits us for mental work ; the 
breathing of vitiated air renders us intellectually dull as 
well as physically anaemic ; illness overthrows our mental 
powers ; a blow on the head may cause unconsciousness; 
various drugs produce hallucinations ; the general state 
of health and of the functioning of the organs of respiri- 
tion, circulation, digestion, secretion, and excretion, is 
reflected in the hopefulness or mournfulness of our 
outlook. We know it is better to ask a favour of a man 
after a good dinner than before it, that irritation is most 
readily aroused, whether in another or in oneself, during 
fatigue. Some people are much affected emotionally 
by states of the weather—are happy in sunshine and 
more or less miserable and despondent in dull, foggy, 
or rainy weather, or are made morbidly irritable by heavy 
wind. 
Though this kind of general connexion is commonly 
recognized as a fact, yet its importance for all that con- 
cerns mental life, and therefore for education, does not 
seem ever to have been fully acknowledged in practice. 
That severe illness incapacitates for mental effort is 
not questioned ; but that every change of health and 
of general bodily condition carries with it a correspod- 
ing change in mental health and power has not beeo 
given its full importance. 
The schoolmaster of tradition was apt to show his 
appreciation of the influence of bodily feelings on mental 
life by a free use of the birch, but he was much less ready
-P-A-G-E-71
BODILY ENDOWMENT 5z 
to trace stupidity to bad ventilation or to impaired 
health, due, it may be, to overwork. Yet performance is 
limited by capacity, and capacity is far from being a fixed 
quantity. We all know that there are times when we 
get through our work both quickly and efficiently, and, 
withal, with enjoyment ; and that there are others when, 
strive as we may, but little is accomplished, and that 
generally of inferior quality. The cause of such differ- 
ences may, indeed, be mental. They may be due to 
some brooding trouble which hinders us from throwing 
ourselves fully into our task. But much more often our 
minds are at rest; it is our bodies that are in some 
way out of order. 
Children, who have not attained the adult’s stability 
of organization, either in mind or in body, are even more 
affected by external influences than we are. That their 
minds may work easily and effectively their physical 
surroundings must be such that the vital bodily processes 
arenot hindered. Happily, this is being more and more 
recognized in respect to the hygienic conditions of 
schools. Probably but little fault in this respect can be 
found with the majority of recent buildings, but economy 
still retains in use thousands of others which stand con- 
demned before the most obvious requirements as to light 
and air and warmth. 
Similarly, the need of children for bodily activity is 
being increasingly acknowledged in practice, though 
slowly and somewhat grudgingly. Despite all the indi- 
cations of nature, children of five years old and upwards. 
are still made to sit for long hours in desks, mainly look- 
ing and listening. Public opinion is satisfied if a few 
minutes daily be spent in the playground and-if, two

52 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
form of bodily drill. Even these deliverances from the 
desks are, however, advocated purely from a physical 
stand-point. Consequently, as long as bodily growth 
goes on normally everything is regarded as satisfactory. 
“‘Gymnastic for the body and culture for the mind” is 
now, as in ancient Athens, the accepted distinction. 
Plato pointed out that gymnastic also has an educative 
effect on the soul, in the development of such excellent 
qualities as courage and fortitude. Modern knowledge 
SnaBIES Ws to go further and to affirm that the relation 
between body and mind is so intimate and constant that 
the intelligence is dwarfed whenever the demand for 
bodily activity is not suitably met. 
So far as many a child escapes such dwarfing it is due 
to his play-time and to his holidays. But these are not 
directly educative, for they give a merely haphazard 
exercise to the bodily powers. A real education employs 
those powers so as to train and develop bodily aptitudes 
and bodily skill. It is this development which is most 
closely connected with mental growth. : 
Of course it is possible to go to the other extreme 
and to regard the cult of the body as the one true note 
in education. This exaggeration must be judged worse 
than the other by all who regard man’s spiritual nature 
as higher than his animal nature. To forget to train 
the mind is far worse than to neglect to train the body. 
For mind directs life, and body carries out its decrees. 
Moreover, as has been said, body does generally take 
some care of itself out of school, but mind left to itself 
usually makes but little advance towards the full stature 
of a man. 
It must be remembered that mind and body start in 
human life on an equally low scale. Though the new-
-P-A-G-E-73
BODILY ENDOWMENT 53 
born babe shows no signs of mental life yet the potenti- 
alities of such life are there. And can more be said of 
the bodily life? True, the existence of the body is 
obvious to sight, to touch, and, it may be, to hearing. 
Yet what is obvious is just that and nothing more. The 
baby has no more human bodily powers than it has 
human mental powers. Each is potential; neither is 
real. Each will be; neither is. The babe can no more 
walk or talk or use its hands skilfully than it can form 
the purposes and plan the conduct which would require 
such bodily manifestations. The physiologist tells us, 
too, that bones and muscles, and, above all, nerves and 
brain are in arudimentary stage. The child will mature 
as a whole human being, mind and body developing in 
close relation. Education to do its true work must 
always be guided by this knowledge. ‘‘’Tis not a soul, 
tis not a body, that we are training up, but a man ; and 
We ought not to divide him into two parts.”? 
We are all familiar with the fact that there is a close 
connexion between the brain and the mind. Indeed, 
we are often not careful to discriminate between the two 
terms. We say a boy or a man has a good brain when 
we wish to praise his intelligence. It is often assumed, 
too, that mental capacity is indicated by weight of brain 
and this by size of skull, so that a person with an 
unusually large head is expected to show more than 
ordinary mental powers, though this, if it be a rule at 
all, is one honoured by many exceptions. 
No clearer proof of the connexion between brain and 
mind could be conceived than the fact that injuries to 
the brain have mental effects which vary with the part 
of the brain affected. For example, a severe blow on 
\Montaigne : Essay on the Education of Children.
-P-A-G-E-74
54 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
the back of the head may produce blindness; damage 
to the lower part of the temple may result in loss of 
control over the organs of speech ; an injury to the top 
of the head has been known to produce such general 
disorders of consciousness that the victim has quite lost 
his personality—his attitude towards his surroundings 
is changed, so that what before he liked now he shuns, 
while he seeks that which he has hitherto avoided. 
Such facts make it clear that the brain can exert 
influence over the whole-body. It is the central organ 
of the nervous system and its essential function is to 
establish connexions between various parts of that sys- 
tem. Into the structure of the system this is not the 
place to enter. The reader, however, who is not fairly 
familiar with it will be well advised to study it in one 
of the many excellent modern books which treat of the 
subject. Suffice it here to note that the nerves form a 
network throughout the body. They are not, however, 
continuous like telegraph wires, nor is the surface or 
cortex—which is the operative part—of the brain, a kind 
of plate of homogeneous and continuous matter like the 
skin of an apple. On the contrary, throughout the body 
the nervous system consists of a number of nerve-cells 
or neurones, which, though they vary a good deal in 
size, are all in form like thin pieces of thread, frayed 
at each end and at intervals along their length. These 
do not grow out of each other, but the ravelled threads 
of one lie very close to those of others, and mixed up 
with them. The connexions between them are those of 
proximity not of structure. 
The special marks of neurones, as distinguished from 
the other cells of which the body is composed, are three! 
they are specially sensitive to excitation ; they transmit
-P-A-G-E-75
BODILY ENDOWMENT 55 
or conduct this excitation though always in one and the 
same direction ; they are modified by their own activity 
so that when two sets of neurones have once acted 
together they are more ready to act together again, and 
this tendency is increased with every repetition. These 
characteristics show at once that the nervous system is 
not a ready-made mechanism but a living community of 
cells which by its own life, and by that alone, grows into 
an organism. 
The excitations in any neurone are, we have said, 
transmitted in only one direction. There are those 
which pass inwards and carry messages regarding the 
state and experiences of the body. An important mass 
of these run from the great internal organs, and their 
combined reports are represented in consciousness by 
that vague yet very real feeling of well-being or its 
opposite which is the main constituent of our moods 
and a chief ingredient in our cheerfulness or gloom. 
Others go from the various organs of sense, each of 
which is constituted so as to react to one kind of impres- 
sions from the external world. All this group, because 
of the direction in which they transmit are called 
afferent, and because of the kind of message they 
convey, sexsory. Those which conduct in the other 
direction are named efferent, and because of their 
effects, motor, for they connect with the muscles and 
excite them to contract or to relax. Hence they mediate 
both movement and the inhibition of movement. From 
the muscles also run sensory nerves which convey the 
message that the movement has been made or inhibited. 
The activity of the motor neurones is dependent on 
that of the sensory : action is in response to impression. 
There is thus needed a third set of neurones whose
-P-A-G-E-76
56 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
function is to connect motor with sensory groups. This 
is the essential work of the neurones which compose the 
cortex of the brain, but there are other connecting 
neurones, especially in the spinal bulb and the spinal 
cord. When the connexion is made in the cortex of 
the brain we are conscious both of the stimulus and of 
the reaction ; when it is made in the cord it is immediate 
and independent of consciousness. Here we reach the 
physiological side of the process of making executive 
actions automatic. The connexion between a certain 
group of sensory neurones and a certain system of motor 
neurones has been made so often that the motor group 
is set in action in the lowest of the connecting neurones 
which lie near them both. 
The development of the nervous system is, then, 
emphatically an organizing of reactions, so that the 
various situations of life may be met by appropriate 
conduct. Very few definite connexions are innate, and 
these are made through the lowest centres. A sharp 
impression on a limb leads to its withdrawal, a sudden 
loud sound induces a start or a cry, a whiff of pepper is 
followed by a sneeze whether we will or no, the eye 
automatically adapts itself to distance, heart and lungs 
respond by quickened or diminished action to various 
impressions. These reflex reactions involve only a 
simple response to a simple stimulus. They have been 
formed in countless generations of our ancestors, and 
the origin of each may be found in some form of 
immediate protection against threatened injury. 
Far more important are the instincts, which through- 
out life play so fundamental a part in determining 
conduct. These also are due to ancestral experience and 
make for the preservation and advantage of the indi-
-P-A-G-E-77
BODILY ENDOWMENT 57 
vidual. But they are both less fixed and more complex 
than are the reflexes. They are represented in the 
nervous system less by definite connexions than by 
strong predispositions to connexions between groups of 
sensory and motor neurones, and the whole circuit always 
involves connecting neurones in the cortex of the brain 
as well as in the lower centres. Hence it is that con- 
sciousness is an integral part of every instinctive act. 
For example, the enjoyment a baby manifests when 
absorbing nourishment shows that sucking is not a mere 
reflex action but is the expression of an instinct. In a 
true reflex if consciousness be present at all it is as. 
an accidental addition, not as really a part of the act. 
I may be conscious that I have sneezed, but the sneeze 
was not the outcome of a desire, nor can a desire not to 
sneeze usually inhibit the explosion, certainly not if the 
stimulus be at all strong. Of many small reflex acts we 
are quite unconscious. Many people, for example, are 
quite unaware, till their attention is drawn to the fact, 
that they are continually blinking their eyelids. 
The instinctive reactions, being as a rule complex, 
have to be organized out of movements which at first 
are purely random. ‘These ‘spontaneous? or ‘impul- 
sive? movements, as they are called, attain no definite 
end. They are simply the outlet for the activity of a 
nervous system as yet unorganized. Whether any of 
them are outside the sphere of instinct is doubtful. In 
any case they are the raw material out of which purposive 
action has to be built. 
By far the largest number of our deeds, then, are 
made possible only by the education of the nervous 
system. In life we have circuits of sensory-connecting- 
motor neurones of all degrees of complexity, from
-P-A-G-E-78
58 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
a simple act such as raising the hat, to the carrying out 
of wide and far-reaching purposes, such as making a 
fortune or writing a book, where, indeed, a whole 
multitude of smaller circuits are united in a regular 
hierarchy to realize one dominant idea. 
We need neither fear nor hope that the organization 
of any individual nervous system will ever reach its 
theoretical limits. The possibilities of connexions in 
the brain are far greater than any one life can realize. 
“Even if we knew the exact arrangement of each 
neurone in a man’s brain it would take a model as large 
as St. Paul’s Cathedral to make them visible to the naked 
eye, a model with whose details only years of study 
would familiarize us. Consider that counting at the 
rate of fifty a minute it would take a man working twelve 
hours a day over two hundred years merely to count the 
nerve-cells of one man.” 
In general plan such a nervous system is common to 
all. But only in general plan. Individuals have no 
more the same possibilities of nerve and brain develop- 
ment than of muscular and osseous development. Con- 
jointly with such differences will be found differences 
in mental qualities. We are, therefore, interested to 
enquire whether any general relation can be established 
between physical and mental attributes. Certainly we 
are all more or less influenced in forming our first opinion 
of another’s intelligence and disposition by his physical 
appearance, though we should generally be at a loss to 
say exactly what signs had influenced us, and in what 
way they had done so. Facial expression and brightness 
or dullness of eye have, no doubt, much to do with out 
estimate. 
1Thorndyke : The Elements of Psychology, p. 151,
-P-A-G-E-79
BODILY ENDOWMENT 59 
Can we then find a bodily measure of intelligence? 
The idea is a tempting one, for bodily qualities can be 
measured and reduced to scale. Roger Ascham ap- 
parently thought that only boys of ‘“‘a cumlie counte- 
nance, with a goodlie stature” were worthy to receive 
learning, and the old aphorism ‘‘a sound mind in a sound 
body” expresses the desired relation more generally. 
Yet when we pass in review our acquaintances we are 
bound to admit that the bodily side of the relation is not 
to be found in height or girth or muscular development. 
We all know instances of children and of adults whose 
physical size is by no means in accord with their mental 
powers. ‘‘Great men have been small, and small men 
great” is no paradox if the adjectives be rightly appor- 
tioned, Researches on normal children support this result 
of general experience, and give no ground for expecting 
any connexion between size of body and power of mind. 
When, however, small size of body is conjoined with 
general feebleness of vital functions we may expect 
to find it combined with some mental deficiency. Such 
feebleness and under-growth are all too frequently due 
to the physical conditions under which the child lives— 
to insufficient or improper nourishment ; to inadequate 
clothing; to want of cleanliness, of fresh air, and of 
health-giving play. Then it is quite the general rule 
that the unhappy little victim shows an arrested mental 
development. Both in body and in mind he is frequently 
two or three years behind the standard of his age. Nor, 
while the same unfavourable physical conditions continue 
to exert their maleficent influence, does he ever make up 
the lost ground. On the contrary, the retardation 
increases. 
When, then, a child generally shows less mental power
-P-A-G-E-80
60 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
than do most children of his age, of similar social rank, 
and attending the same kind of school, the cause should 
be sought first in physical conditions. Too often a child 
is simply classed by his teacher as ‘dull? or ‘inattentive’ 
or ‘a dunce,’ and it is left at that. This is to take far 
too fatalistic a view of the immutability of what is 
assumed to be an inborn defect, and far too pessimistic 
an estimate of the possibilities of education. The first 
step is surely to discover the cause of the mental back- 
wardness, Is it physical, or moral, or mental? Does 
the child suffer from some unsuspected physical defect, 
such as imperfect vision or hearing, adenoid growths, a 
general state of physical weakness, or the presence of some 
congenital disease? Or, is he wanting in perseverance 
and honesty of effort, and in constancy of purpose? Or 
lastly, is he really of poor natural intelligence, and, if 
so, is the defect general or particular? Many a child 
shows poorly at lessons which require even simple 
abstract thought or sympathetic imagination who is 
nevertheless exceptionally good in all practical occupa 
tions. It is to be feared that the school estimates of 
children which are based on lessons are always in grave 
danger of being one-sided and of doing little justice to 
individuals who will yet play a successful part in life 
That, however, as far as it goes, condemns the school, not 
the child. It is only when such questions are asked and 
answered that the real education which that particular 
child needs can be effectively given. 
Of these enquiries, those into physical states should 
be made first. Happily, the medical examination of 
school children will bring to light most of the physical 
defects. It remains for the teachers to recognize practi- 
cally their mental bearings. Nor need teachers wait for
-P-A-G-E-81
BODILY ENDOWMENT 61 
the doctor’s visit to test those of sight and hearing— 
frequent causes of apparent dullness in children really 
of normal intelligence. Indeed, the medical tests are 
often not directly relative to the conditions of the class- 
room. What the teacher needs to know specifically is 
whether each child can read Ais writing on the blackboard 
and can distinctly hear Ais words when he is teaching. 
These points are easily—if not very exactly—tested by 
placing each child at the back of the class-room and 
requiring him to read from the blackboard, and to write 
from dictation, a number of disconnected words which 
do not suggest each other. Of course, the teacher 
should be careful to write in his ordinary style and size, 
and to speak in as even a tone as possible, and with no 
more distinctness than marks his customary speech. The 
children who fail in the test should be brought forwards 
until they reach a part of the class-room in which they 
can hear and see clearly and without strain. Such a 
test may further have the often desirable result of leading 
the teacher to write more legibly on the blackboard, and 
to speak more distinctly, and with a more ‘thrown- 
forward? voice, than he has been accustomed to do. 
There is no doubt that these defects in hearing and seeing 
must be discovered in such a way as this. The children 
will not announce them. Often, indeed, they are 
unaware of them, but even when they know them they 
usually try to hide them. 
Other defects of sense organs also have an effect on 
the mental life. Quite a considerable number of people 
are colour-blind; to them red and green are indis- 
tinguishable, and in extreme cases all colour appears as 
a dull lifeless prey. When we consider how much of 
our enjoyment is due to appreciation of colour we
-P-A-G-E-82
62 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
recognize how much such unfortunate persons lose. Of 
course, this defect is immediately made manifest in a 
class in which the children are taught to draw in coloured 
crayons ard to paint in water-colours, and are allowed— 
as they always should be—to select their own colours. 
An analogous defect on the side of hearing is tone- 
deafness. Just as those who are colour-blind may have 
excellent vision for all but colour, so the tone-deaf may 
be quite sharp of hearing. They are deaf not to sounds 
but only to differences in pitch. For them the charm 
of melody and the majesty of harmony do not exist. I 
once knew a very worthy clergyman who could not 
distinguish between the Dead March in Saul and 
Mendelssohn’s Wedding March. Such complete tone- 
deafness is rare, but between it and the sensitive ear of 
the born musician are many gradations, all of which are 
represented in human lives. Obviously it is mere waste 
of time to attempt to teach music to a child with this 
congenital defect at all strongly marked. 
Defects of taste and smell have little educational sig- 
nificance, and defects of sensations of movement are not 
usually of a very serious character. Still it should be 
borne in mind that individuals do differ in this as in 
other bodily endowments. Manual dexterity which is 
delightfully easy to one child remains always impossible 
to another. ‘‘ His fingers are all thumbs” as we say; 
and though practice and training will do much they 
will never give him the deftness which comes natural to 
another. 
It is evident that unless a teacher take note of such 
bodily peculiarities of his individual pupils he may, quite 
unintentionally and unknowingly, do some of them very 
serious injustice, and he may in some cases waste some
-P-A-G-E-83
BODILY ENDOWMENT 63 
of his own time and much of theirs in trying to do what 
nature has made for ever impossible. The decision 
whether a defect may be decreased by suitable exercises 
or is unalterable is evidently one which demands serious 
consideration, and at times medical advice. Broadly 
speaking, defects of hearing and sight are less amenable 
to remedial treatment than are motor defects, which, 
indeed, can in nearly all cases be lessened.
-P-A-G-E-84
CHAPTER IV 
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 
Man, like all other animals, is the outcome of a long 
line of ancestry, and his nature, to some indetermined 
extent, has been modified by the lives and experiences 
of his forefathers. In the history of any race of animals 
natural selection has been at work, so that those most 
adapted to their conditions of life have had the best 
chance of surviving, and the kinds of reactions which 
most effectively meet the requirements of life have, in 
the course of time, become embodied in the nervous 
system. 
The more simple the life to be led the fewer are the 
reactions needed. If such reactions be not made the 
animal perishes. \The more complex the life the greater 
necessity is there for the adaptation of reactions, the same 
in kind, to circumstances more or less different. Again, 
if the animal fail to make the adaptation he will suffer 
or die, according to the importance of the reaction. 
Here we have the respective functions of instinct, of 
the innate adaptation due to ancestral experience, and of 
intelligence, or the personal power of adapting action to 
more or less new conditions. Obviously, as man, even 
in the savage state, leads a far more complex life than do 
any of the lower animalsintelligence must play a larger ~ 
proportionate part in the determination of his conduct
-P-A-G-E-85
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT | 65 
than in that of any other being. Similarly, instinct is 
less exhaustive of the life of a monkey or of a dog than 
of that of an insect. Generally, the period of imma- 
turity of any animal, relatively to its whole life, is a 
rough measure of the respective shares of instinct and 
intelligence in determining his conduct. \ In that period 
of preparation man learns by experience to undertake 
that guidance of life which in the animal that matures 
nearly at birth rests in the sphere of instinct. 
Instinct appears in its most undiluted form among the 
insects, and some instructive and interesting studies of 
the instincts of insects have been contributed to com- 
parative psychology. Many of the lines of action ob- 
served would demand a very advanced degree of intel- 
ligence and reasoning were they planned by the insect; 
but this supposition is negatived by the fact that no such 
intelligence is shown in any other acts of its life. Yet 
instinct is by no means as unerring as has frequently 
been assumed. For instance, ‘‘The larvae of our 
common oil-beetle (Melo#) are parasitic on the bee, 
Anthephora, It deposits its ten thousand eggs without 
observable discrimination ; but the active young larva 
instinctively seizes and attaches itself to any hairy object. 
Thousands must go astray. They have been found on 
hairy beetles, flies, and bees of the wrong genus. Some, 
however, become thus attached to the one suitable 
Species, and are conveyed by the Anzhophora to her nest, 
where they promptly eat the egg she lays.?? Even 
when instinct seems most perfect the ‘survival of the 
fittest’—or hickiest >—is secured at a heavy cost. 
_ When we pass to the vertebrate animals we still find 
“instinct playing a great part in the control of life, though 
1Lloyd Morgan: Animal Behaviour, pp. 81-82. 
Ww Ez
-P-A-G-E-86
66 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
the traditional assumptions that instinct and intelligence 
are incompatible, and that while man is ruled by the 
latter all other animals are left to the former, are shown 
by careful observation to be untenable. More than a 
century ago that great naturalist Gilbert White remarked 
that “the maxim that defines instinct to be that secret 
influence by which every species is compelled naturally 
to pursue at all times the same way or track without any 
teaching or example, must be taken in a qualified sense, 
for there are instances in which instinct does vary and 
conform to the circumstances of place and convenience,” 
and the more numerous, though not more careful, obser- 
vations of later years have established the point. Darwin 
noted that ‘‘a little dose of judgement or reason... often 
comes into play, even with animals low in the scale of 
nature.”* And Dr. Wallace wrote: ‘Much of the 
mystery of instinct arises from the persistent refusal to 
recognize the agency of imitation, memory, observation, 
and reason as often forming part of it. Yet there is 
ample evidence that such agency must be taken into 
account. Both Wilson and Leroy state that young birds 
build inferior nests to old ones, and the latter author 
observes that the best nests are made by birds who 
young remain longest in the nest. So, migration is now 
well ascertained to be effected by means of vision, long 
flights being made on bright moonlight nights when the 
birds fly very high, while on cloudy nights they fly low, 
and then often lose their way. Thousands annually fy 
out to sea and perish, showing that the instinct to migrate 
is imperfect, and is not a good substitute for reason and 
observation.” 3 
These conclusions of modern naturalists have a very 
Lester 56. 2 Origin of Species, ch. 8. 8 Darwinism, ch.
-P-A-G-E-87
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 67 
direct bearing on the only instincts which concern us— 
thoseof man. Biologists have naturally studied instinct 
where they have found it most free in its operations and 
least liable to modification by any possible interference 
of intelligence. This has, however, resulted in concen- 
trating attention on the outward action or series of 
actions. What mental process accompanies such actions 
in an insect it is impossible to say : one cannot enter into 
the mind of a caterpillar. The practical result has been 
that determined activity has been made the one essential 
characteristic of instinct. In a word, instinct has been 
confined to instinctive behaviour ; mode of conscious- 
ness has been ignored. It is true that none now go so 
fr in banishing mind as the Elizabethan writer Owen, 
who spoke of ‘‘a naturalle Instincte engraffed in the 
stones or lyme...against any wett weather to sweate 
with great dropps of water.” But the limitation of view 
does lead to an undue insistence on the blindness of 
instinct, as, for example, when Hamilton spoke of in- 
stinct as “Yan agent which performs blindly and ignorantly 
a work of intelligence and knowledge.” An insect 
Which does an instinctive act once, and then dies, cer- 
tainly does not learn from experience, but a dog, though 
guided mainly by instincts, yet learns to follow their 
Pomptings in many different ways adapted to various 
Circumstances. And, as we saw in the quotation from 
Dt. Wallace, practice improves the nest-building of 
birds, 
Now, improvement and adaptation clearly imply the 
Striving of a conscious being to improve its condition. 
Thus, the higher the animal the more important in the 
‘stinct is the mental prompting which finds expression 
in the instinctive act. The neglect of this element of
-P-A-G-E-88
68 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
instinct accounts for the common opinion that man has 
few instincts, the lower animals many. What is really 
meant is that manXhas few instinctive actions which are 
nearly or wholly reflex in their nature* and which, con- 
sequently, show little or no improvement through 
practice. This, of course, is true; and it is well for us 
that it is so, as, evidently, the more of mechanical 
organization is inherited the less possibility is there of 
improvement. Civilization was born and has grown 
just because man does not come into the world a perfected 
mechanism. . 
The ordinary literary use of the word ‘instinct’, how- 
ever, refers primarily to the mental tendency, and only 
secondarily to the act in which it finds expression. It 
was not at all a bad definition given by Paley over a 
century ago that ‘‘an instinct is a propensity prior to 
experience, and independent of instruction.” The pro- 
pensity is the essential point, and that springs up in 
appropriate circumstances without help from experience 
or from instruction. But whether the propensity cam 
find one outlet or many depends on the complexity of 
the nervous system. The simpler such system the mort 
the nerve-circuit may be expected to be limited, so that 
one definite motor reaction which, though it may be 
complex is always the same, follows on one definite kind 
of sensory impression. This is what we find in insects. 
With man there is, as we have seen, an indefinite 
number of possibilities of motor reaction on any particulat 
sensory impression, and though the existence of a0 
instinct means that there is a predisposition towards 
certain classes of motor response to certain forms of 
sensory impressions yet these innate tendencies to t 
sponse are not fixed and definite reflexes. They aft
-P-A-G-E-89
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 69 
classes of activities rather than determined single actions 
or seties of actions, 
Further, man’s instincts are not mature at birth. 
The undeveloped character of his brain would make this 
manifest if the baby’s behaviour did not do so. *It is as 
the nervous system matures that, one by one, impulses 
and propensities begin to manifest themselves for which 
nothing in the child’s experience can account,and which 
are further proved to be the outcome of human nature 
by the fact that they appear in all normal children. 
Throughout childhood quite up to adolescence new ‘ 
instincts appear at intervals and old instincts take a new © 
and more leading part in life. Thus, when an instinct 
Tipens there already exist many organized lines of action 
through which it can find expression. Moreover, it 
tipens when intelligence is already active in directing 
conduct. “Fhe instinct gives the propulsive force, the 
intelligence may add the directive ruling.~ 
This is by no means to confuse instinct and intelli- 
gence. On the contrary it is to distinguish them more 
carly by finding the difference in their mental nature 
instead of in their outer manifestations. Many an 
instinctive action of a lower animal attains its purpose 
better than an intelligent act of a child, or even of a 
man, A beaver builds its house and a bee constructs its 
tomb with much greater success than would be attained 
bya child even after much practice. Yet the child is 
More intelligent than bee or beaver. And it is intelli- 
gence which counts. 
Now, instinct as @ proclivity is more or less blind: it 
does not foresee consequences. But such an impulse, 
fist arising in a life under the control of intelligence 
and in which many lines of action are already established

while others are barred, does not issue in a blind action, 
but in one determined by habit or by planning. The 
control of intelligence may grow gradually. The innate 
proclivity may find satisfaction only in an end which is | 
beyond the present and which can be reached onl 
through a series of intermediate steps. To these it 
prompts, and intelligence may at first see but a short | 
way ahead. A“To the evolutionist, the youth courting 
the maid is merely obeying an impulse cunningly cor 
trived by Nature for the preservation of the species¥! 
Yet “‘we may say that the youth’s consciousness, when 
he first goes courting, is to be expressed, not in the 
form, ‘I want a wife and family’, but in the words, ‘I 
must just see her to-day’? But, as the appropriate 
lines of conduct are more and more followed, the view 
ahead becomes longer and wider, till at length the whole 
meaning of the behaviour and of its emotional spring is 
seen. So intelligence arises in the sphere of instinct, and 
plays its true part of direction. 
It is well to draw attention to the fact that an instine 
tive propensity becomes a powerful force in life only on 
condition that it is given frequent and appropriate outlet 
in action. Here we have the possibility of education 
For, when vent is refused to an instinctive impulse it 
gradually loses its vitality and at last becomes atrophied. | 
On the other hand, by calling forth an instinct frequently 
and strongly we increase its power. The decision as t0 
which instincts in any individual case the educator should 
wish to cultivate, and which to discourage and repress 
cannot be given by psychology. The considerations 
operative in such questions belong to ethics and 
sociology.

Another point has a similar educational bearing. It 
is that instincts are stronger at one period than at another, 
and if they do not lead to action when they are in the 
nascent and growing stages any later attempt to evoke 
them is likely to fail. A child who has never been called 
on to let his altruistic instincts find expression in deeds 
of kindness is likely when a man to experience no sym- 
pathetic emotions strong enough to call forth much effort 
for the good of others. 
Unless in the various circumstances of life inner 
impulses were felt, life could not even begin. And 
unless each of those impulses had a specific, though not 
a particular, direction, energy would be frittered away in 
ineffective outputs of activity, for we cannot act in 
general. Thus, instinct is fundamental and permeates 
alllife. It is instinct which supplies the motive power ; 
it is intelligence which more or less directs that power 
into effective channels. * Especially is this manifest with 
achild, in whose conduct intelligence counts but little in 
comparison with impulse. But even with the wise adult 
instinct has sway, though it may be overlooked because 
teason guides the conduct to which it impels. Always 
there is something more than reason in the attraction we 
feel towards particular lines of action. ‘‘ Speaking 
generally, man is only in part conscious of his own pur- 
poses in their real meaning and value. It is his own 
nature—of which, after all, he only knows the surface— 
which sets him his purpose, and impels him to carry it out? 
NEvery instinct is more or less specific. * It is a special 
method of meeting particular situations, or calls for 
action, The adaptation due to intelligence takes the

two-fold form of increasing the range of origin and of 
modifying the mode of reaction. 
Events do not happen in life in isolation, nor do they 
disappear and leave no trace behind. Thus, our experi- 
ences get bound together, and a recurrence of one may 
recall to mind others which in some points resemble it, 
or which formerly occurred with it. Nor is this result 
merely intellectual. If the original experience moved 
us, we are moved similarly, though generally less 
strongly, by its recall. In this way an instinct may be 
aroused by some thing or event or even remembrance 
which did not originally awaken it. A picture of a loved 
friend will, for example, immediately evoke the instinct 
of tenderness, while something which reminds us of an 
enemy may arouse anger. The remembrance of an occa- 
sion when one made oneself conspicuously ridiculous 
gives one a very effective repetition of the feeling of 
shame which attended the original mistake. A horse 
shies at a coat by the side of the road: the original 
instinct was to avoid a crouching animal, but it has 
acquired a sufficiently wide reference to be called into 
play by anything which has the same general appearance. 
Such extensions greatly enrich our lives. The original 
reference of our instincts was, doubtless, in every case to 
something which affected our bodily welfare. By exten- 
sion to associated and analogous experiences they are 
made responsive to what may be called moral, as distinct 
from physical, occasions. 
The corresponding increase on the side of expression 
has been more generally recognized. It is, of course, 
limited by structure. In fleeing from a pursuing dog a 
rabbit does not take to the water nor attempt to climb @ 
tree. But within such limits the more intelligent the
-P-A-G-E-93
RR GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 73 
animal the greater is the variety of instinctiveresponse. A 
dog when threatened with a whip will make a great many 
different movements, all expressive of the instinctive fear 
which animates him. With man the forms of instinctive 
reactions are often determined by social customs. When 
the instinct to fight seeks to find expression in act, an 
Englishman raises his fists, an Irishman flourishes his 
shillelagh, an American draws his revolver, an Italian flies 
to his knife, a Frenchman arranges a duel with swords or 
pistols. In more sedate circles the same instinct may 
find expression in a law suit, while among the saints of 
the earth it may take the negative form of “‘ heaping 
coals of fire on the enemy’s head.” 
Thus, in the ever-changing life of man, while the 
emotional nucleus of an instinct remains broadly con- 
stant, both the means of arousing the instinctive feeling 
and the forms in which it finds expression are very varied 
and are much generalized. This is important in the 
development of human experience, for it may happen 
that several instincts are evoked by a given set of circum- 
Stances, and then tend to become compounded or fused. 
Thus arise more and more complex emotions influencing 
Conduct in more and more complex ways, sometimes, 
Indeed, impelling one in incompatible directions,__ It is, 
then, to the emotional impulses we must look if we 
Would understand the instincts of man. 
Perhaps the time may come when these instincts may 
be thought as worthy of careful and systematic study as 
those of spiders or of ants, At present the amount of 
Sientific observation which has been devoted to the 
human instincts is much smaller than has been lavished 
on those of the lower animals. So much, indeed, is this 
the case that there is no thorough-going agreement as
-P-A-G-E-94
74 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
to what instincts man has. Darwin, taking instinctive 
behaviour as the test, thought that “man, perhaps, has 
somewhat fewer instincts than those possessed by the 
animals which come next to him in the series.” On 
the other hand, the late William James, holding that 
every innate tendency is an instinct, wrote “‘no other 
mammal, not even the monkey, shows so large an 
array.?? 
Certainly, taking account of the adaptations of which 
we have just spoken, man’s modes of instinctive be- 
haviour are very varied, but, as has been said, this does 
not carry with it an equal diversity in the emotional 
propensities which are the central and constant parts of 
instincts. Failure to connect instinctive actions with 
primary emotions has led both to disagreement as to the 
number of human instincts and to the frequent reduction 
of the psychology of the emotions to little more than 
hortatory description. M.Ribot? and Dr. McDougall‘ 
have done good service in insisting that the emotion 
and the instinctive act are always parts of one and the 
same life-process, and to their writings this part of our 
discussion owes much. The attempt to classify instinc- 
tive acts is, then, subsumed under that of trying to 
distinguish the elementary emotions, that is, those which 
cannot be reduced to simpler forms. The number of 
these is certainly limited. 
We see in every original human instinct a full mental 
process which develops with experience and repetition till 
it is easy to find within it the aspects of knowing, feeling, 
and willing, which at first are obscure and confused. 
Even in adult life these are not separable in fact but only

distinguishable in thought. We cannot feel emotion 
without being prompted to act, and we can neither feel 
nor desire except in reference to something of which we 
are cognisant. One factor, no doubt, may be tem- 
porarily dominant. A burst of emotion may sweep 
away all considerations of prudence and cause one to 
depart altogether from the line of conduct one has deter- 
mined to follow. Or a feeling which has become the 
tuling passion in life may bind both will and intelligence 
to its chariot wheels so that they are used mainly, if not 
exclusively, in its service. Yet though intelligence and 
will then play less than their normal parts, in neither 
caseare they absent. They put the brake on the violent 
emotion, and they keep the passion within more or less 
ltgitimate bounds. Similarly, a student at work may 
be mainly putting forth an activity essentially intellec- 
tual, yet his impulse to do this work remains throughout 
an undercurrent which really determines the course of his 
thoughts, And that impulse is both emotional and 
volitional. Or lastly, a person may be fully engrossed 
maamying out a purpose, say, in winning a race. Yet 
intelligence is there as a quiet guide, leading him to 
avoid obstacles and to make the required turns; and 
unless he were impelled by such feelings as desire to win, 
0 surpass his competitors, or to test or exhibit his speed 
and endurance, he would not have engaged in the race 
at all, 
In every act, then, all three fundamental aspects may 
bedistinguished. But they are not independent elements 
tntering in various proportions into different combina- 
tons. Each is dependent on the others and interpene- 
trated by them, and in themselves they are nothing 
but the abstract results of our analysis of concrete mental

life’ Often, indeed, we cannot make the distinction 
with any certainty or definiteness. Take one’s attitude 
towards a beautiful work of art. Can one separate the 
emotional from the intellectual elements in one’s admira- 
tion, or say how the whole is permeated by volition? 
As life develops the connexion between intelligence 
and instinct becomes closer. *The instinctive propulsion 
towards certain modes of acting remains, but experience 
and intelligence act upon it till blind craving becomes 
deliberate purpose and impulsive act is absorbed in 
planned conduct. ‘‘So that human life is permeated 
through and through with instinctive action, determined 
in part, however, by intelligence and volition.”* 
The most elementary instincts are those directly con- 
nected with the preservation of life, and these are the 
first to show their presence in the life of the infant. The 
earliest of all is the instinctive seeking for food prompted 
by the feeling of hunger. It may be objected that 
hunger is not an emotion but an appetite. The distinc- 
tion implied is that emotion is mental and appetite 
bodily. It has, of course, long been recognized that 
when an emotion is experienced there are bodily mani- 
festations, either in outward act and gesture or in some 
kind of disturbance of the vital processes. But these 
were held to be the results of the emotion, and to follow 
it. A recent theory—associated with the names of 
Lange and James—exactly reverses the traditional order. 
According to this theory the outward event or inward 
thought which occasions the emotion first leads to bodily 
disturbance, and the emotion is the echo of this in con- 
sciousness. Each theory seems to set the mental and the 
bodily too far apart. It would seem a truer view that 
1Wundt: Lectures on Human and Animal Psychohgy, p. 397.
-P-A-G-E-97
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 77 
the mental and the bodily disturbances arise together, 
and that each is one half of the total reaction of the whole 
man on the circumstances. Adopting this view the 
distinction between appetite and emotion becomes 
merely one of origin. An appetite is due to a certain 
state of some of the vital organs: an emotion arises on 
the presence to consciousness of something in the 
external world, or of the memory of such an external 
stimulus. Each is a disturbance both of mental calm 
and of regular vital functioning. 
urther, it may be remarked that such an appetite as 
hunger and thirst develops in the course of life to what 
is undoubtedly emotion. As experience widens the 
impulse to seek food for oneself enlarges, by union with 
other instincts, into all those wide-reaching desires and 
purposes which are connected with the support and 
advancement of one’s family. Of course, the primordial 
appetite remains, but it is only the nucleus of a broad 
set of tendencies. 
The second instinct surely seen in the infant is that of 
fear. This manifests itself in a shrinking from the 
feared object and in a cry which the mother can dis- 
tinguish from those of anger and of bodily discomfort. 
As soon as the child can run the shrinking develops into 
fight and concealment. There is thus a double bodily 
taaction ; for while fear by itself tends to paralyse activity 
and is marked by lessened heart-beat and respiration, 
flight needs increased activity which causes accelerated 
tespiration and circulation. Yet this increase is not 
normal. The heart throbs painfully and the breath is 
short and hurried—the child running away in fear pants 
rather than breathes. This shows that both the stimu- 
ting influence of rapid movement and the inhibition
-P-A-G-E-98
78 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
which attends the fear are operative and are inter- 
fering with each other. When the fear is intense, the 
inhibition may prevail. Birds are said to be ‘ fascinated’ 
by certain snakes, which means that fear has entirely 
inhibited flight. So a man stands appalled before a 
great and irretrievable disaster. If the heart be weak 
great fear may cause death, and even with normal lives 
the same extreme case of inhibition is not unknown. 
Fear is provoked by what seems to threaten, but it 
is proportioned not only to the amount of danger appre- 
hended but to the extent of loss the feared act would 
bring if it were accomplished. For example, a man is 
apt to fear robbery more than usual when he has a con- 
siderable sum of money in his possession, even though 
the real danger is no greater than at other times. Simi- 
larly, ‘‘ whether the height on which we stand be elevated 
only a few feet, or have beneath it a precipitous abyss 
of a thousand fathoms, our footing, if all other circum- 
stances be the same, is in itself equally sure. Yet, 
though we look down without any fear on the gentle 
slope in the one case, we shrink back in the other case 
with painful dismay.” + 
Fear has played an important part in the history of 
the race. In our admiration of courage we are apt to 
lose sight of the fact that at times “‘discretion is the 
better part of valour,” and that to avoid dangers is 
sometimes the only way to escape them. If this be so in 
civilized society it was obviously yet more so in those 
early days when each man carried his life in his hand, 
threatened not only by his fellows but by beasts and by 
forces of nature of the powers of which he was ignorant 
and behind which he imagined spirits generally malig-

nant. Hence arose that instinctive dread of the un- 
known which still shows itself plainly in children, which 
ever predisposed mankind to superstition, and which still 
to some extent haunts the minds of most of us. Many an 
adult who really disbelieves in ghosts would yet shrink 
instinctively—no matter what his intelligence might say 
—from passing a night alone in a room in which a foul 
murder is known to have been committed and in which 
the victim is reported to appear at a certain hour. The 
fear of ignorance is often apparent in the vague antici- 
pation of hardships and dangers which many a timorous 
woman feels on behalf of a relative or friend who is about 
to go into a distant land. 
As fear is an original part of our nature it isimpossible, 
even were it desirable, to eradicate it. The educational 
task is to attach it to those things, and to those only, 
that are worthy of being feared. Thus from physical 
shrinking it may be developed into moral sensitiveness. 
Intelligence, exercised on increased knowledge and 
prompted by example and suggestion, is the one instru- 
Ment for effecting the transformation. 
This leads us to the social value of fear. -Had man 
not known fear, society would have been impossible, 
for society involves the enforcement of obedience to laws 
and rules. It has been said that all society rests ulti- 
mately on force. Certainly with all promiscuous societies 
the world has yet seen this is the case. Some members 
are restrained—if restrained at all—from violence and 
lawlessness only by fear of imprisonment or of execution. 
Only in more select and smaller communities is the 
moral fear of social disapproval of wrong-doing a 
sufficient curb, while only the choicest spirits are inde- 
pendent even of this, and feel fear only at the wrong-
-P-A-G-E-100
80 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
doing itself. In most minds these two forms of mon 
fear are combined in varying proportions. Whether or 
no the fear of physical force be present, this moral fear 
is essential to every society. In primitive communities 
it 1s connected with the dread of the unknown, “‘that 
awe of the Divine Nemesis which was felt by religious 
pagans, and, though it took a more positive form under 
Christianity, is still felt by the mass of mankind simply 
as a vague fear at anything which is called wrong-doing. 
Such terror of the unseen is so far above mere sensual 
cowardice that it will annihilate that cowardice: it is 
the initial recognition of a moral law restraining desire, 
and checks the hard bold scrutiny of imperfect thought 
into obligations which can never be proved to have any 
sanctity in the absence of feeling. ‘It is good’, sing 
_the old Eumenides, in Aeschylus, ‘that fear should sit 
as the guardian of the soul, forcing it into wisdom— 
good that men should carry a threatening shadow in their 
hearts under the full sunshine; else, how should they 
learn to revere the right?? That guardianship may 
become needless; but only when all outward law has 
become needless—only when duty and love have united 
in one stream and made a common force.” ! 
Fear has its place, then, in school as in other com- 
munities. But it should be fear of wrong-doing, not 
mere fear of personal suffering. It should rather be 
an unconscious factor in the determination of conduct 
guarding from wrong acts, than a dominant and insistent 
motive prompting to right acts. For we have seen that 
fear tends to inhibit activity, and that is even more true 
of the mental than of the bodily forms of activity. 
A child terrorized by threat of punishment—which all

too frequent experience assures him may be confidently 
expected to be carried into execution—is simply inhibited 
from thinking or remembering. His brain is numbed. 
And it must be borne in mind that there are weak as well 
as strong natures, and that defect of physical tone predis- 
poses to all the emotions characteristic of weakness. 
“In a weakened organism fear is always in a nascent 
condition.”? On the other hand, on some children such 
threats may have no other effect than to arouse resent- 
ment. These are the matter-of-fact little people who 
do not bother their heads with representations of the 
future. Always they despise every danger which is not 
immediately present, for they really do not see the risks. 
Much of what is commonly called physical courage, as 
distinguished from moral courage, is rooted in such 
insensibility. ‘‘In many persons the absence of fear 
only amounts to the absence of imagination.” ? 
Lastly it may be noted how an attitude of fear towards 
Parent or teacher shuts out the child from that intimate 
personal communication without which there is no real 
training of character. In other words, a parent or 
teacher who inspires real personal fear has little or no 
ttue influence over his child. Dickens has well re- 
marked; ‘‘ Few people know what secrecy there is in the 
young under terror. No matter how unreasonable the 
terror, so that it be terror.’’® 
What threatens does not, however, always arouse fear 
or prompt to flight. If the danger seem small, or if 
the individual threatened be bold and energetic, he feels 
anger, and is prompted to express that feeling in some 
form of aggressive action. This pugnacity is much

more marked in some races than in others—in the Sikhs, 
for example, much more than in the Bengali. Nor do 
individuals of the same race differ less among themselves. 
Thus, what provokes fear in one may arouse anger and 
resistance in another. 
The organic concomitants of anger are the opposite 
to those of fear. There is acceleration of respiration and 
heart-beat, the face generally flushes, the muscles are 
braced, often the teeth and the fists are clenched. A 
general appearance of restrained tenseness marks the 
emotion so long as it does not find vent in violent speech 
oraction. Yet the innervation is spasmodic, as is shown 
by the raucous voice, by the abortive movements of the 
hands and arms, and sometimes by the pallor of the face 
following upon, or taking the place of, the usual flush- 
ing, Tracing these back to their origin in the history 
of the race Spencer says: ‘‘ What we call the natura 
language of anger is due to a partial contraction of 
those muscles which actual combat would call into play; 
and all marks of irritation down to that passing shade 
over the brow which accompanies slight annoyance, ate 
incipient stages of these same contractions.” + 
No emotion is so liable to get beyond control as that 
of anger. The reference to the self is extremely inti- 
mate, and the instinct of self-assertion, with which we 
shall deal presently, is likely to be awakened with it and 
to add a cumulative force. Nor can anger be directly 
and immediately controlled by reason. True, its mode 
of expression may be changed, but in the change the 
two instincts together are likely to develop into such 
complex and more permanent emotions as hatred or 
envy, and the impulse to aggression to be transmuted 
| Principles of Psychology, part ix. ch. 7.
-P-A-G-E-103
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 83 
into the purpose of revenge. The only effective way 
to check anger is to arouse another and opposed instinct, 
such as the general one of tender regard for others or 
the more specific one of love for an individual, each of _ 
which finds expression in acts of kindness instead of in” 
those of hostility. The struggle of anger and love in 
a passionate soul is powerfully exemplified in Othello: 
“« ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night; for 
she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to stone; I strike 
it, and it hurts my hand. O the world hath not a sweeter 
creature.” 1 
And again, when he kisses Desdemona immediately 
before he smothers her: 
“Ah, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade 
Justice to break her sword ! One more, one more : 
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, 
And love thee after; one more, and this the last : 
So sweet was ne’er so fatal. I must weep, 
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow’s heavenly 3 
It strikes where it doth love.” 2 
When restrained within due limits, however, anger 
plays an important part both in the individual life and 
in social relationships. As self-control is developed, the 
emotion, when excited by non-personal obstacles, be- 
Comes a source of energy and an impulse towards the 
overcoming of difficulties. In common parlance we 
Should not speak of it then as anger; indeed we have 
no special name for it. But the action to which it 
Prompts is aggressive, and the feeling towards what 
hinders us is always of the same general nature, whether 
the hindrance be due to the action of another or to the 
obstinacy of things.

The extension of anger to acts which do not affect 
oneself is commonly called indignation. At the root this 
is anger compounded with tenderness for the sufferer. 
“If it were in our power to trace back our emotions 
through the whole long period of our life, to our boy- 
hood and our infancy, we should find, probably, that 
our most vivid feelings of early resentment, if I may 
use that term in such a case, were not so much what is 
commonly termed anger, as what is more commonly 
termed indignation. Our deep and lasting wrath in our 
nursery is not against any one who exists around us, 
but against the cruel tyrant, or the wicked fairy, or the 
robber, or the murderer, in some tale or ballad. Little 
generosity in after-life can be expected from him who, 
on first hearing, as he leans on his mother’s knee, the 
story of the Babes in the Wood, has felt no swell of 
anger, almost to bursting of the heart, against the 
“guardian uncle fierce’, and who does not exult in the 
punishment which afterwards falls on that treacherous 
murderer, with a triumph more delightful than is felt 
by the most vindictive in the complete gratification of 
their own personal revenge.” ? 
When it is considered further that similar feelings 
may be excited in all, or most, members of a community 
when a cruel crime is committed, and that what we feel 
in common with others we feel most strongly, we see 
how this generalized anger takes the form of social 
punishment, or retributive justice. 
The existence of the next two instincts was first recog- 
nized by M. Ribot, who called them positive and 
negative self-feeling. They play, however, a very 
important part in the development of life. We get

nearer to ordinary speech if we term them self-assertion =~ 
and self-abasement. They are somewhat akin to anger 
and fear respectively, and are often excited with them. 
But they are by no means the same; for while anger and 
fear are centred in others these are essentially concerned 
with the self. The former has for its organic concomi- 
tants a general heightening of vital functions, and 
expresses itself in an expansion of the whole body which 
“swells with pride”. The latter has exactly the opposite 
characteristics. Each is excited by comparison of oneself 
with some other person or thing. In the one case we 
feel ourselves superior, in the other case inferior. The 
cock strutting in the farm-yard and the child calling 
upon all and sundry to ‘‘see me do this” are examples 
of simple forms of self-assertion. The same child 
shrinking under reproof and the shame of detec- 
tion in a forbidden deed manifests the opposite 
Instinct, 
The former is obviously the root from which may 
spting pride and vanity as well as true self-respect. 
United with the energy of pugnacity it brings man into 
tivalry with his fellows. "Then we have emulation, or 
the impulse to try to excel, which is so important an 
incentive to effort. The boy learns to delight in his 
superior strength and skill, as does the man in his 
eminent intellect or in his conspicuous worldly success. 
Unmodified by kindly feeling towards others emulation 
may easily degenerate into envy and malice, but kept 
Within legitimate bounds it is a spur which is needed 
by the vast majority of mankind. 
Self-abasement has its part to play as a corrective to 
excess of self-assertion. To esteem oneself at one’s 
teal worth—neither over-estimating in pride nor under-
-P-A-G-E-106
86 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
estimating in unreal humility—is the true wisdom of 
life. 
Individuals. differ in the strength of these two 
instincts. "The well-balanced mind which estimates both 
self and others at their real relative values is rare. 
Education should try to reduce undue self-confidence 
and to mitigate undue self-depreciation. In each case 
the means is obviously such comparison with the work 
of others as will bring home to the child the true worth 
of his efforts. For a morbid self-assertiveness renders 
a man anti-social. Too high an esteem for self easily 
passes into contempt for others which is akin to hatred. 
On the other hand, no energetic service is to be expected 
from an individual who hesitates constantly in self- 
distrust, shivering on the brink of every enterprise. He 
also, in his negative way, is an ‘‘enemy to the republic.” 
As at times each one of us is brought into relation 
both with our superiors and with our inferiors it is 
certain that in every life there is occasion for the activity 
of both these instincts, It is evil, however, when the 
one takes the form of bullying the weak and the other 
that of cringing to the strong. Few people are more 
contemptible than the Uriah Heeps of this world. 
The primary emotions we have so far considered ate 
egoistic. They make for the good of the self but do 
not prompt to action for the good of others. The latter 
tendency is, however, as innate as the former, and shows 
itself very early in the baby’s smile of recognition of 
its mother and in the caressing touch. The child then 
gives the first sign that it is beginning to distinguish 
between itself and its surroundings. Hitherto its 
experience has not made even this primary differentia- 
tion.

In the history of the race, and in comparison with 
the lower animals, the original form of a tender regard 
for others is found in maternal love. That this, in its 
primitive form, is still a strong impulse in girls is proved 
by their delight in ‘mothering’ children younger than 
themselves and in playing with dolls. 
The first extension of this maternal instinct probably 
made it parental. Little paternal love exists among the 
lower animals, and in the primitive races of mankind the 
tie is very weak. It would thus seem to be an extension 
of the primary instinct of maternal love, originating 
through the establishment of permanent family relations. 
Similarly, extension to other members of society could 
only be made when mankind began to live in peaceful 
communities bound together by relations of mutual 
help. 
Many attempts have been made to deny that altruism 
isa true spring of conduct, and to reduce every act to 
one of self-love. “Self-love is the spring of all our 
actions and determinations” said Voltaire, and this was 
the favourite doctrine of those eighteenth century philo- 
sophers who proudly called themselves the ‘Enlightened.’ 
The same doctrine has been advanced many times since. 
“Tender feeling is as purely self-seeking as any other 
pleasure, and makes no enquiry as to the feelings of 
the beloved personality,” wrote Dr. Bain.1 Of course, 
ait isa primary emotion, it can only be known by being 
felt, If any individual can truly affirm that Ze has never 
felt any tenderness towards others, obviously no one can 
confute him. But if he imagine that he has thus estab- 
lished a general truth it is as if a man born blind were’ 
to deny the existence of light and colour and all that

sight gives the normal man. Human nature would, 
indeed, be a poor thing were altruism not an original 
ingredient in it. Out of so simple an emotion develops, 
in various circumstances, sympathy, gratitude, pity, 
benevolence: indeed, all that really binds man to maa 
and makes life worth living. 
2 The close connexion of tender feeling with pugnacity 
must: be noted. When the chicks are attacked the 
mother-hen, timid as she usually is, will show fight 
The same holds throughout. Anger and indignation 
are as surely moved by an injury to one we love as by 
an attack on ourselves. If, in addition to love, there 
is also a protective feeling due to the weakness of the 
loved one as compared with ourselves the anger is even 
more easily aroused and is less easily abated. Do not 
our hearts burn within us when we hear of cruel treat- 
ment of a child? Indeed, do we not so overflow with 
tender emotion and anger that we are indignant with 
any cruelty, whether its object be one of ourselves of 
one of the lower animals? Who has not seen the little 
child weep in compassion over an injured toy? Was 
such weeping due to self-love? we would ask the 
advocates of universal egoism. 
We have, then, in the union of anger and tenderness 
those outpourings of indignation which we have already - 
considered. Anger guards what tender feeling cherishes. 
The last of the instincts to be developed is that of 
sex. This, like hunger, has its basis in an organic 
appetite, and with many of the lower animals it has not 
advanced beyond that stage. In the higher vertebrates, 
however, there is conjoined with it that attraction of 
individuals of opposite sex for each other which among 
men has always been one of the most powerful motive-
-P-A-G-E-109
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 89 
forces of conduct, and one of the greatest and most 
frequent causes of individual happiness and misery. 
The connexion with pugnacity is even more obvious 
than in the case of the tender emotion. For sexual love 
has an element of self-feeling which is powerful in 
proportion as the appetite enters into it. Thus, rivalry 
rouses anger against a personal injury and not merely 
because of a conviction that the happiness of the loved 
one is threatened, though this, well or ill founded, is 
regularly present. The jealous man or woman is, of 
necessity, an egoist, though the egoism may be mixed 
with regard for another, and even concealed by it. 
The appearance of this, the most powerful of the 
instincts, at the comparatively late age of puberty enables 
its manifestations to be studied with greater ease than 
those of instincts which are developed earlier. The 
child is quite devoid of the instinct ; in the young boy 
or girl it is nearly inoperative. At puberty it begins 
to show itself by a vague emotional unrest, of the nature 
and object of which the boy or girl is naturally unaware. 
There is some disturbance relatively to the other sex. 
The boy, when not in the presence of girls, is full of 
self-assertion in his imagined intercourse with them: in 
their presence this commonly gives place to confusion 
and bashfulness. The girl generally becomes coy and 
self-conscious. In the case of each sex there are occa- 
sional lapses into the attitude opposite to the prevalent 
one. 
Emotionally sex is the richest of the instincts. Con- 
sequently, its emergence into activity carries with it a 
deepening of the emotional life, a tendency to self- 
analysis, a longing for wider and deeper realms of feeling. 
So adolescence is the age for enthusiasms ; and, amusing
-P-A-G-E-110
go THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
as the enthusiasms of youth may be to the cold-blooded 
cynic, ill is it with the soul in which they are not felt. 
For enthusiasm supplies a vent for the overflowing 
emotions and thus hinders them from being turned back 
on themselves and developing that morbid self-con- 
sciousness which is the characteristic danger of the years 
when the new force within is too great to find issue in 
the accustomed channels. If only the enthusiasms be 
healthy and be concerned mainly with others they are 
good. 
An important safeguard, too, is a healthy interest 
in bodily activities, especially in organized co-operative 
games. Nor should the effect of giving the elder boys 
authority and responsibility in the school community, 
and thus supplying a continual outlet for their exuberant 
energy, be overlooked. 
The instincts of maternal love and of sex are the 
foundation on which the whole structure of the family 
has been built. In the family the tenderness for others 
which first appears as the love of the mother for her 
offspring finds its most natural extension. 
The union of the two instincts of tender emotion 
and anger is increased in strength and force by that innate 
tendency of animals of the same kind to live together, 
which is found not only in man but in many of the lower 
animals, and which, for want of a more beautiful name, 
we must perforce call gregariousness. The herrings 
swim in schools, the bisons roam in herds, the British 
workman foregathers at Margate or at Blackpool, society 
has its crushes, and generally, people go where others 
go, often for no better reason than that the others do 
go. Few can enjoy a solitary country walk, no matter 
how beautiful the scenery, and many cannot endure their
-P-A-G-E-111
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 91 
own company even for an hour. Even without conver- 
sation the presence of others is felt to be ‘company’. 
Of the ordinary man it is true that ‘‘to be alone is one 
of the greatest of evils for him. Solitary confinement 
is by many regarded as a mode of torture too cruel and 
unnatural for civilized countries to adopt. For one long 
pent up on a desert island, the sight of a human foot- 
print or a human form in the distance would be the 
most tumultuously exciting of experiences.”? The 
hermit has always been so much the exception among 
men that he who avoids the crowd is looked upon with 
suspicion and dubbed misanthrope, even though his 
heart may overflow with the milk of human kindness 
and his good deeds be many if secret. 
This instinct of attraction of like for like does not 
imply sociability or sympathy, though it is the basis on 
which both those complex emotions must be built. The 
masses of people that in the evening crowd certain streets 
in every large town are not drawn together by kindly 
feeling for each other : they are, indeed, a herd of 
strangers. Nor are they there because of a common 
attraction, such as rows of well-lighted shops, for they 
are most in evidence after the shops are closed. It is 
simply the same primary impulse which leads sheep to 
crowd together in a field. Dr. McDougall pertinently 
asks ‘‘ What proportion of the ten thousand witnesses 
of a football match would stand for an hour or more in 
the wind and rain, if each man were isolated from the 
rest of the crowd and saw only the players ?””* 
We all know, too, the difference it makes to a body 
of actors whether the house be full or empty, to a

preacher whether a crowded congregation or an array of 
empty benches be before him, to a speaker whether he 
address a large body of his fellows or have before him 
two or three small boys and a dog. It is not that in the 
unfavourable cases there is a deliberate choice not to 
play or speak well. It is that in the favourable cases 
one’s powers ate really greater. And further, each of 
the hearers is affected in a similar way. Men appreciate 
best what they hear or see in company. So there is 
unconscious emotional interaction, and, as we say, the 
general atmosphere is favourable or unfavourable to an 
effective result. 
The instincts hitherto considered are concerned with 
the personal life and with relations to other human 
beings. Those we have now to glance at are primarily 
operative in dealings with things rather than with people. 
The earliest to appear, and the most wide-reaching in 
its scope, is curiosity. It may be excited by anything 
‘strange in a familiar setting, and it prompts to a neat 
and thorough examination of the novelty. Of course, 
the new element must not appear to threaten, or fear 
will be aroused. Indeed, in the behaviour of a young 
child in presence of an unfamiliar person or thing an 
alternation of curiosity and fear is often shown. Curiosity 
prompts approach ; fear induces withdrawal : we see the 
child drawing near and shrinking back as the one of 
the other instinct comes to the front. 
The essential mental attitude in curiosity is interroge 
‘tion. The instinct, therefore, prompts to the activity 
of discovery. It is the spring of all desire to know, 
the origin of all science. For all science is an attempt 
to answer the two fundamental questions: What is it? 
What is its use? To foster, guide, and originate
-P-A-G-E-113
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 93 
curiosity is the essential work of teaching. Left to 
itself, curiosity will fritter away time and energy in 
dealing with the new and the trivial. As is admirably 
said in an article in The Times* on ‘ Vulgar Curiosity’ - 
“Curiosity is neither a virtue nor a vice, but one ¢ 
the chief forces in human nature, to be praised or blamea 
entirely according to the use that is made of it. Like 
fire, it is a good servant but a very bad master. It 
is a powerful aid to wisdom in those who have a serious 
purpose in life; for without it they are not enriched by 
experience or disinterested observation. They make up 
their minds too quickly about everything and are apt 
to become fanatics. They grow mannered in their 
thought, as artists who do not study nature grow man- 
nered in their execution. But curiosity is a no less 
powerful aid to folly in the frivolous. For in them it 
is wandering and uncontrolled. They rely on it to 
preserve them from the boredom that is always threaten- 
ing them. Provided they are amused by it, they make 
no distinction in its object. All they ask is continually 
to see some new thing that will divert them, without 
calling upon their minds to make any effort. There is 
no system in their curiosity, and no connexion between 
their experiences. They will turn from one to another, 
4s monkeys will turn from a nut to a piece of glass, and 
ftom a piece of glass to scratching themselves. All they 
ask is that the new stimulus shall be stronger than the 
old; and to each stimulus they present passive minds, 
making nothing of any experience. Thus their taste in 
experiences grows continually coarser, like the taste of 
drunkards in alcohol; and, like drunkards, they must 
satisfy it at all costs. Curiosity, in a mind altogether

-P-A-G-E-114
94 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
mastered by it, is cruel as the grave, cruel without 
passion or pretext... 
“We cannot, nowadays, look on at bodily torture; 
but there is a large public that will go to any trouble to 
witness mental torture, and that cares nothing how much 
it may increase that torture by its curiosity... Thus 
they are as cruel as children that pelt a frog, and for 
the same reason—namely, that they put their own 
pleasure before everything else. This kind of cruelty 
comes mainly from want of imagination, and it isa 
signal proof that curiosity does not quicken the imagina- 
tion unless properly controlled and directed. Yet some 
degree of imagination is needed before curiosity can 
exist at all. The heartless curiosity of a crowd is 
altogether different from the heartless indifference of 
animals or idiots. They flock to see a murderer because 
murder is a crime that appals them, because they have 
a human interest in the extremes of human nature. But 
their imagination, like their curiosity, is passive, not 
active. It will make no effort on its own account, but 
can be quickened only by external excitements ; and 9 
the noblest of human faculties is perverted into a kind 
of intellectual prurience more repulsive than the indiffer 
ence of animals, as ‘lilies that fester smell far worse than 
weeds.’ 
“Vulgar curiosity is a besetting sin of our time 
because now we hear so much about everything that 
happens. Where a hundred years ago people gossiped 
only about their own village, they can now gossip about 
the whole world. Village gossip may often be cruel; 
but at least it is gossip about people well known to the 
gossipers ; and the curiosity that is satisfied by it must 
be to some extent humanized and controlled by sympathy
-P-A-G-E-115
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 95 
and friendliness. But, when we gossip about people 
whom we have never seen, it is very easy for us to forget 
that they are human beings and to regard them as mere 
spectacles for our amusement.” 
It is, therefore, a mistake, as serious as it is common, 
to believe that the only function of the educator with 
regard to children’s curiosity is to stimulate it. The 
effect of the encouragement of childish curiosity without 
any attempt to direct and prune it is shown in the prying 
and impertinent questions asked by badly brought-up 
boys and girls who are old enough to have learnt that 
every personal matter is not common property. Some- 
times it takes the more objectionable forms of reading 
private letters, of listening at doors, of peeping through 
keyholes. Here, as elsewhere, education has to use 
the innate impulse, but in using it to prune and 
direct it. It is an organ of intelligent knowledge which 
is needed, not a mere instrument of sensational enter- 
tainment. 
Closely united to curiosity are surprise and wonder. 
The former has no characteristic emotional tone and no 
endurance, It is a mere shock in the presence of the 
unexpected. Wonder is often regarded as identical with 
curiosity, and the word is at times used to imply that 
questioning attitude which marks the full instinct. 
Sometimes, however, the questioning is either absent 
altogether or very vague and undefined, and this seems 
to be the mental attitude to which we most commonly 
apply the term ‘wonder? as a noun rather than as a 
verb, ‘‘I wonder how that is made’ at least suggests 
some impulse to find out ; but ‘The peasants were full 
of wonder at the eclipse? does not imply that they sought 
an explanation. Wonder in this sense is content to
-P-A-G-E-116
96 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
accept the unknown as the inexplicable. From it is 
easily developed the emotion of awe, which arises when 
the unknown and not-understood impresses by its power. 
From curiosity, on the other hand, develops admiration, 
which implies appreciation of beauty or skill. There 
is thus in admiration an intellectual element which is 
not present in awe. In other words, admiration is made 
possible by enquiry, awe is content to accept without 
question. 
Of course, surprise and wonder may be preliminary 
stages in the development of curiosity. The skilful 
teacher often thus uses them with young children. He 
introduces unexpectedly that about which he wishes 
them to learn, and awakens surprise. By a question or 
two he shows them that they do not understand the 
matter. All that is easy. The real educative work is 
in the next step—the transmutation of the static wonder 
into the dynamic curiosity. When this is not done in 
the case of any child the knowledge conveyed to him 
belongs to him in the sense in which an adhesive stamp 
belongs to the envelope to which it is affixed, not in 
the sense in which the new wood belongs to the tree 
which makes it. 
Very early in life the baby shows an impulse to retain 
things which attract him. He cries when the watch 
with which he has been playing is taken from him. Of 
course, he soon forgets the deprivation, as he will equally 
soon ignore the restitution if the object be given back 
to him. That is because his mental life is in so formless 
a stage; in the ordinary sense of the word he has 10 
memory, but is altogether held by the present. In this 
acquisitive instinct, however, we have the root of that 
desire to obtain and to hold from which has arisen all
-P-A-G-E-117
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 97 
man’s economic advance. ‘There is no need to teach a 
child the idea of personal property ; education has only 
to guide it and to bound it by regard for the rights of 
others. 
The most elementary mode in which personal property 
can be acquired is to gather what is valued wherever 
it may be found. This tendency is strongly shown in 
nearly all boys. In girls it is less frequent and less 
permanent. When it does appear in a girl it is often, 
perhaps usually, not so much due to an instinct as to 
imitation of her brothers. ‘This, presumably, is the 
result of evolution. The man has for ages acquired the 
family property, while the woman has mainly been 
engaged in applying it to the family needs. 
The collections which boys make when they are left 
to themselves are generally quite worthless; for even 
if the objects themselves be of any value for knowledge, 
there is little or no attempt to use them as material to 
be studied. The work of education is not to discourage 
the instinct to collect, but to unite it with that of 
curiosity. Almost any collection can be made of some 
use in this way. Even the stamp album may suggest 
many questions about the peoples of other lands; an 
atrangement in order of time may yield historical 
suggestions, a comparison of face-values may lead to 
enquiries as to the postal relations between different 
countries. 
The collecting form of acquisition when dominant in 
adult life becomes a kind of mania. It is an abnormal 
and pathological continuation of a youthful form of the 
expression of the instinct. The blue china monomaniac, 
or the man who spends most of his time and substance 
on the acquisition of old Italian violins, is as far removed 
Ww. G
-P-A-G-E-118
aN 98 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
from sane mental development as is the miser who denies 
himself the comforts and even the necessaries of life 
in order to hoard money. In him the instinct of acquisi- 
tion has been diverted from its end to its means; for 
the end is provision for self-conservation. 
United with strong self-assertiveness and unchecked 
by altruism acquisitiveness leads to inroads on the pro- 
perty of others, either directly, as with the thief or the 
burglar, or indirectly, as with the promoter of bubble 
companies or the fraudulent tradesman. Combined with 
the primary appetite for food, with the tender and sexual 
emotions, and with self-assertion and pugnacity, it is 
evident that it spreads far into life; it enters strongly 
into the desire ‘to found a family’ and to leave one’s 
descendants well provided with this world’s goods. 
Man’s instinctive dealings with the world are not 
exhausted by the desires to know and to possess. He 
is further impelled to turn to use. It is evident that 
without this instinct civilization could never have begun. 
The savage scoops out a cave, then he builds a hut, he 
digs out a boat, he makes tools and weapons. ‘That was 
the beginning. The fruition is seen in architecture, in 
mighty ships, in wonderful machinery. The instinct to 
construct has made possible a development and a satis 
faction of the desire to possess which would have been 
otherwise impossible. 
In studying the stages of the advance of constructive- 
ness we have one of the most easily followed charts of 
the way in which an instinctive mode of activity is 
modified and extended by the growth of intelligence. 
We see further that the growth of knowledge has beet 
made possible only by the advance of constructive ability. 
What is the scientific investigator without his instru-
-P-A-G-E-119
GENERAL MENTAL ENDOWMENT 99 
ments? Slow and halting was the advance of knowledge 
before man’s powers of intelligence were applied to the 
construction of telescopes, microscopes, and balances. 
It would seem, then, that the instinct of construction 41. 
is of the very first importance in the life of man; that 
without it man could have advanced but a very little 
way in knowledge or in wealth. How strange a com- 
mentary on this truth——proved abundantly not only by 
psychology but by history—is the traditional practice of 
schools. They appeal simply to mental activity, ignor- 
ing the child’s instinct to deal actively and constructively 
with things and in so dealing to satisfy and excite his 
curiosity at one and the same time. This has for cen- 
turies been the common scholastic practice, and because of 
it most of the real education of man has been attained!’ 
outside the schools. When boys after leaving: school 
went, as a rule, to learn some more or less skilled handi- 
craft, and girls were trained in household work by their 
mothers, the constructive instinct was not without an 
educative outlet. Now, when so many lads become 
etrand boys and girls learn to despise housewifery, this 
Provision for the activity of the instinct is withdrawn 
from many, especially of those who live in towns. The 
country child is called on out of school to do many 
things about farm or garden which bring the instinct 
into play, and if he remain in the country after his school 
days are ended he is much more likely to learn some real 
constructive work than is the town boy. During school- 
days the latter roams the streets when not in school; 
after school-days he too often drifts by insensible degrees 
towards the unemployable. The application of psycho- 
logy could not take a more fruitful form than the 
recognition in practice that intellectual activity divorced
-P-A-G-E-120
roo THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
from physical dealing with things loses half its strength 
and more than half its utility. 
All the above innate impulses seem to be certainly 
instincts, as each of them fulfils the conditions of show- 
ing a definite emotional state as its nucleus and of having 
specific, though in some cases wide, modes of excitement 
and of expression. Other innate tendencies which are 
sometimes classed as instincts are wanting in this specific 
quality. Such are play, imitation, and sympathy. So, 
too, joy and sadness are not specific emotions, but are 
rather qualities which attach to any and every emotion. 
There may be a sad curiosity, as when one asks about 
the death of a friend, or a joyful curiosity, as when one 
enquires into the particulars of some unexpected good 
fortune. A youth in love is sad or gay according to 
the demeanour of the fair one. Certainly, few people 
can easily imagine a joyous hunger, yet, I suppose, such 
a condition would not be strange to many a fasting 
ascetic. A kind of delicious fear is also by no means 
an unknown state of feeling, as when one reads or hears 
a thrilling story 
. “of most disastrous chances, 
Of moving accidents by flood and field, 
Of hair-breadth ’scapes i’ the imminent deadly breach, 
Of being taken by the insolent foe, 
And sold to slavery.” 1 
In discussing instincts, then, we have not exhausted 
inborn tendencies, but only those of which the special 
character indicates physiologically a predisposition to 4 
specific nerve-circuit, and psychologically a tendency 
to meet certain kinds of situations in certain broadly 
definite ways.

CHAPTER V 
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 
Tuar all the instincts and general tendencies discussed 
in the last chapter are common to normal men is in no 
way inconsistent with the patent fact that mankind pre- 
sents much diversity. Indeed, the explanation of natural 
endowment by heredity accounts for such differences. 
For an individual inherits his qualities from the whole 
line of his ancestry. Only brothers and sisters have 
the same ancestral line, and in each case this is crossed 
with another line for their children. Nor does heredity 
mean that a child reproduces one of its parents, or presents 
acombination of both. It may show some qualities of 
one remote ancestor, some of another, always in a fresh 
combination. The transmission of qualities and pro- 
pensities should be thought rather under the figure of 
continually new chemical combinations than under that 
of a series of mechanical mixtures in which units of 
endowment are united into various totalities. Hence, 
we may be confident that no two persons will be exactly 
alike, : 
On the other hand, it follows that people descended 
ftom ancestries that have much in common will exhibit 
certain general characteristics. Here we have the ex- 
planation of the marked distinctions between races and 
tations, A people living in a limited area, intermarry-
-P-A-G-E-122
102 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
ing much among themselves and little with the outside 
world, would of necessity find a good deal in common 
if the ancestral trees of all its members could be traced 
back for several centuries. ‘Take the case of our own 
country. For eight and a half centuries England has 
suffered no foreign invasion, and peaceful foreign immi- 
grations have been fewand local. The present population, 
then, must be descended from ancestors whose number 
would form but a very small percentage of its own. 
The smallness of this number cannot be estimated from 
the totality of population at any former period, for from 
that would have to be deducted all those whose lines 
of descent have died out. Although, then, it is not 
possible to draw out such a plan of the ancestry of any 
Englishman of to-day as would trace back his descent in 
every possible ramification, yet it is obvious that such 
a scheme would meet and intermingle with those of other 
Englishmen in an indefinitely large number of points. 
We may go further and explain in the same way the 
general resemblances which mark the inhabitants of one 
part of the country and separate them from those of 
another—the men of Yorkshire from those of Devon. 
Till recent years interchange of inhabitants between 
different parts of the country was rare, and still is com- 
paratively infrequent in rural districts. So, while the 
inhabitants of our great towns, drawn as they are from 
all quarters, show many common characteristics and 
continually fewer peculiarities, the peasantry still offer 
examples of the old local colour. 
Further, during centuries a nation lives under the 
same human conditions. Each generation enters into the 
whole systems of ideas, beliefs, interests, and sentiments, 
accepts them, and passes them on. Thus in course
-P-A-G-E-123
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 103 
of time is built up the soul or mind of the nation, as 
distinct from the minds of its individual citizens—that 
national way of viewing life, which more or less orients 
each individual outlook. Here, then, is another way 
in which heredity works. Each individual inherits not 
only his personal qualities and impulses but the spiritual 
air in which they will be exercised, the intellectual and 
moral nutriment they will receive, the ideas with which 
they will be clothed. 
How great in fact is the conjoint result of these inter- 
acting forces is seen at once when we call to mind the 
very essential and fundamental differences between the 
Eastern and the Western worlds. We are friendly allies 
of the Japanese, but anyone who has studied Bushido 
must realize—without at all prejudicing the question of 
better or worse—how different are the Japanese concep- 
tions of life and of duty from our own. 
When we come nearer home we recognize that each 
nation of Western Europe has specific characteristics, 
each lives its life in a different spirit. This determines 
the genius of the national languages, and explains how 
it is that a translation can never give the essence of 
literature which expresses not facts but aspirations, not 
teasonings but ideals and longings. Not the speech of 
the mouth only but the very hopes of the heart are 
diferent by just those impalpable shades which refuse to 
be conveyed in any idiom but their own. 
How far national mental and moral tendencies, as 
distinguished from the forms in which they find expres- 
sion, are transmitted by heredity, and how far they are 
simply absorbed afresh by each new generation, is a 
matter of doubt and dispute. Dr. Archdall Reid says: 
“If the child of refined and educated English parents
-P-A-G-E-124
104 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
were reared from birth by African cannibals, then in body, 
when grown, he would resemble his progenitors more 
than his trainers. Does anyone believe that the‘ same 
would be true of his mind?... The English child we 
imagined as reared by African savages would certainly 
display no hint of the language and general knowledge 
of his parents, no tincture of their moral, social, religious, 
and political ideals and aspirations. He would ruth- 
lessly murder and enjoyingly eat the stranger. He 
would harry the stranger’s property and annex the 
stranger’s wives by the wool of their heads whenever 
practical. He would treat his own wives:as beasts of - 
burden, and perhaps thrash them as a matter of routine. 
His aesthetic ideals would be satisfied by a little paint, 
some beads, and plenty of grease ; his moral ideas bya 
homicidal devotion to the tribal chief. His god would 
be the tribal fetish, to whom he would offer human 
sacrifices. He would go naked and unashamed.”? 
This may largely be granted, for it specifies modes and 
fashions of outward conduct. There can be no doubt 
that the hypothetical individual would be a savage, with 
savage ideas and customs. Yet the question seems to 
remain whether there would be no difference between 
him and the other savages, whether he would not be an 
English savage after all. Would he, for example, be 
more easily and thoroughly converted from his savagery 
than his companions who were descended from genera- 
tions of savage ancestry? I do not pretend to answer 
the question, and yet it seems that by analogy such an 
expectation would not be in any way absurd. A French 
child, born and brought up in England does not become 
an English child. It indeed speaks English, and may

be English in all that it has received from without. But 
it has received all in a French mind, and there remains a 
subtle differentiating shade which we recognize as the 
French spirit. An intensely interesting field of enquiry 
is here open to competent observers. Moreover it is a 
most important field ; for no adequate understanding of 
the individual is possible unless his development can be 
examined in both its factors—the inherited nature and 
the inherited society with all its traditions, its views of 
life, its aspirations. It is, however, a region into which 
very few such enquirers have as yet ventured. 
Even were I able, it would not be necessary to try to 
set forth the mental qualities even of the chief nations of 
Western Europe. Our aim is to gain such an under- 
standing of English children as will enable us to educate 
them as well as in us lies. This purpose is here met if 
we have some working knowledge of the general mental 
characteristics of Englishmen ; that is, of the general mind 
Which is so potent in moulding each individual mind. 
Burns’ aspiration was 
“Oh wad some power the giftie gie us 
To see oursels as ithers see us!” 
We can have that advantage, for that pioneer of social 
psychology, Dr. Gustave Le Bon, has given a sketch of 
What appear to him to be our national characteristics. 
He says: ‘‘ The dominant notes of this mental constitu- 
tion from the point of view of character are: a mass of 
will which very few peoples, save perhaps the ancient 
Romans, have possessed, an indomitable energy, a very 
strong initiative, an absolute self-mastery, a sentiment 
of independence pushed even to the verge of excessive 
unsociability, a forceful activity, very active religious
-P-A-G-E-126
106 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
feelings, a very stable morality, a very precise idea of 
duty. 
“From the intellectual point of view, no special char- 
acteristics can be given, no peculiar elements indicated 
which cannot be found in other civilized peoples. 
One can scarcely note more than a sound judgement 
which seizes on the practical and positive side of things 
and does not lose itself in chimerical researches, a very 
lively interest in facts and but a moderate taste for 
general ideas, a certain narrowness of mind which makes 
it difficult to see the weak sides of religious beliefs, and 
so removes those beliefs beyond the range of discussion. 
“To these general characteristics must be added that 
complete optimism of the man whose path in life is 
clear, and who never imagines he could choose a better, 
who always knows what his country, his family, and his 
gods expect of him. This optimism is pushed to the 
point of regarding as well worthy of contempt all that is 
foreign.... This contempt for the foreigner is doubt- 
less, from a philosophical point of view, a sentiment of 
a very low order: but from the point of view of the 
prosperity of a people it is of the greatest value.... 
‘All the qualities which have just been enumerated 
are found in the most diverse social classes ; no element 
of the English civilization can be discovered on which 
their solid impress has not been stamped.” + 
Perhaps we may add to this, as one of the elements of 
national character of which we are most proud, that love 
of ‘ fair play? which we like to think flourishes among us 
more strongly than elsewhere—an idea which certainly 
derives some support from the fact that no other language 
has an exactly equivalent term. 
1 Lois psychologiques de Pévolution des peuples, pp. 107-109.
-P-A-G-E-127

The educational bearings are two-fold. In the first 
place, having decided how far this picture of ourselves 
isa true one, we are at least conscious of the points of 
national character all would wish to see strengthened, 
and of those which it would be well to try to soften. 
In the second place, the recognition that other peoples 
have equally well-marked national characteristics should 
make plain to us the futility of trying to transplant in 
their entirety foreign educational ideas and methods to 
our own land. We may get suggestions from Germany 
or ftom France, but the application must be determined 
by our own national needs and our own national char- 
acter. ‘The education of one people evidently cannot 
be adapted in all its details to another, but one may 
always learn much by studying those details.” ! 
The distinctions of race are generic. We know that 
within them there is infinite individual variety. ‘‘ Not 
only one man is unlike another, but every man is essen- 
tially different from every other, so that no training, no 
forming, nor informing, will ever make two persons alike 
in thought or in power.” 
No one, probably, is less liable than a teacher to be 
\ed away by sentiment to accept that most fantastic of 
al the eighteenth century philosophical fables—that all 
men are equal. He has constant experience that the 
children before him are unequal in all bodily and mental 
qualities, and that as they grow older these inequalities, 
far from disappearing, accentuate themselves. But 
Personal differences cannot be separated from life. The 
boy who is healthy and able, of strong will and of per- 
severing character, earns more of the good things of the

school than does his weaker school-fellow. The same 
qualities will mean greater success for him in the world, 
While the weak and vacillating man is waiting fa 
‘something to turn up”, the strong man bends the 
present to his will, and presses forward to his object, 
As Bacon said, ‘‘A wise man will make more oppor- 
tunities than he finds.’ So nothing can make men 
equal either in their nature or in their opportunities; 
for what is opportunity to one is impassable barrier to 
another. Nor can the output of their lives be 
equalized except through the suppression of al 
those activities which do the most for the worlds 
welfare. 
It is no more true of individuals than of nations 
that the differences simply result from surroundings 
We do not grow up alike because we are not bom 
alike. No one would deny this with respect to the 
body, and the more complete becomes our knowledge 
the more it is established that bodily functional differ 
ences imply mental differences. That one boy becomes 
strong and active while his brother grows up weak and 
sluggish is not attributed to differences of physical cate 
Yet nothing is more common than the doctrine that whata 
child becomes mentally and morally depends entirely 00 
the training he receives. That is as false as would be 
a similar statement about the body. Children come into 
the world with some tendencies much stronger that 
others ; with some, perhaps, unduly weak. In extremt 
cases the weakness is so marked that for practical pur 
poses the tendency scarcely exists. Thus we have 
hereditary geniuses and hereditary fools; hereditary 
criminals as well as hereditary saints, and perhaps 9 
greaternumbers. ‘‘ Moral insensibility is usually innatt,
-P-A-G-E-129
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 109 
and coincident with other symptoms of degeneracy. 
Among several children of the same family, brought up 
in the same surroundings, having received the same care, 
a single one may differ from all the rest, be amenable 
neither to gentleness nor to force, and manifest a pre- 
cocious depravity, which will only strengthen as he grows 
older.” 
Certainly, as we said, it is impossible to set out such 
achat of the ancestry of any one as would account for 
all his personal characteristics. Nor is it claimed that 
one can lay all one’s sins and shortcomings on one’s fore- 
fathers, Surroundings do count for much, and they can 
and do modify in many ways the inborn nature. Yet 
the modification is in detail rather than in essence. As 
Ruskin eloquently says: ‘The greatness or smallness 
of a man is, in the most conclusive sense, determined 
for him at his birth, as strictly as it is determined for a 
fruit whether it is to be a currant or an apricot. Educa- 
tion, favourable circumstances, resolution, and industry 
tan do much; in a certain sense they do everything 3 
that is to say, they determine whether the poor apricot 
shall fall in the form of a green bead, blighted by the 
@st wind, and be trodden under foot, or whether it shall 
expand into tender pride, and sweet brightness of golden 
velvet. But apricot out of currant,—great man out of 
small,—did never yet art or effort make; and, in a 
general way, men have their excellence nearly fixed for 
them when they are born; a little cramped and frost- 
bitten on one side, a little sun-burnt and fortune-spotted 
on the other, they reach, between good and evil chances, 
such size and taste as generally belong to men of their 
alibre, and, the small in their serviceable bunches, the

great in their golden isolation, have, these no cause for 
regret, nor those for disdain.” + 
Zoologists and botanists, however, find it possible to 
establish intermediate classes between the individual 
and the wide genus of which it is a member. If this 
can be done, even roughly, with human beings, it will 
tend to give a similar clearness to our thoughts and 
a similar guidance to our observations of children as the 
doctrine of species gives in the study of animals and 
plants. 
I suppose we all do roughly classify people 
round a few more or less explicit types. ‘“‘We 
pass instantaneous judgements on strangers every 
day. THlere’s a gull, and here a fox, here a sulky 
brute, and here a right good fellow; here a maa 
with a will of his own, and here a man without one... 
Women whose faces are an index of meanness, weakness, 
vanity, spite ; women whose faces tell you at a glance that 
they have spent their lives in the love of home and 
children.”? The teacher sorts his pupils in his own 
mind according to their mental qualities. ‘These are the 
‘good? boys in a class, those the ‘average’, and those 
others the ‘dullards’. Often, as I have already hinted, 
the judgement is fallacious, for the test of school lessons 
is too narrow and too arbitrary. Nor is such a classifica- 
tion—even were it true in every detail—of real practical 
help outside the school walls. It is to be hoped that the 
scholars will find something better to do in after life than 
to learn lessons, and it is safe to prophesy that if 
they do not they will discard the lessons all the 
same.

VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 111 
Education should, at least, find out broadly what each 
child is fit for, so that some, at least, of the deplorable 
waste of ability due to putting boys to callings for which 
they have no aptitude may be avoided. At present a 
boy’s career is often determined by the kind of opening 
which chances to present itself, entirely regardless of its 
possibilities, and with no question as to its relation to the 
boy’s powers. When not pressed to an extreme point 
there is truth in M. Binet’s contention: ‘‘I believe that 
the determination of children’s aptitudes is the most 
important business of instruction and of education; 
according to their aptitudes they should both be taught 
and be directed towards an occupation.”+ Any such 
determination must result from the careful and systematic 
study of individuals; to this the first step is the con- 
sideration of leading characteristics, and this resolves 
itself into a grouping round types. 
Such a classification was attempted by Galen nearly 
two thousand years ago, and was based on current physio- 
logical theories. He assumed that four humours were 
Present in different proportions in each person, and that 
they gave a certain colour and form to the mental consti- 
tution. Thus there were four temperaments. When 
the blood was dominant there resulted the sanguine 
temperament, marked by brightness, optimism and 
instability. Did the gall—or black bile—rule, the result 
was the melancholic temperament, with the qualities of 
depression, proneness to brooding, suspicion, irritability, 
and obstinacy. When the bile was the most powerful 
the temperament was choleric, and the individual showed 
tnergy, impatience of opposition, and strong will power. 
lastly, if the lymph was the determining humour the 
1 Les Idées modernes sur les enfants, p. 11.
-P-A-G-E-132
112 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
lymphatic or phlegmatic temperament, with its 
characteristics of tranquillity, lassitude, and inertia, 
appeared. 
The physiological basis has long been abandoned, but 
the distinctions drawn—which indeed were based on 
observation of well marked modes of behaviour—have 
remained, and the names of the temperaments have 
passed as descriptive terms into common speech. 
It may be noted, however, not only that the classifica- 
tion refers to adults, but that the normal person passes 
to some extent through all the temperaments in turn. 
The child is naturally sanguine, the youth melancholic 
in so far as he is inclined to introspection and emotion- 
alism, the mature man energetic or choleric, and the old 
man who has lost the fire of youth shows the leading 
qualities of the phlegmatic temperament. Such an 
evolution was, indeed, traced by Aristotle long before 
Galen set forth -his doctrine of temperaments. The 
same idea is involved in Shakespeare’s well known Seven 
Ages of Man.' Omitting 
‘the infant, 
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms,” 
and the two last stages, which are those of incipient and 
developed senile decay, we have 
“the whining school-boy, with his satchel 
And shining morning face, creeping like snail 
Unwillingly to school,” 
a picture which, indeed, does not flatter the Elizabethan 
school, but which shows the cheerfulness and suggests 
the versatility of the boy. 
1As you ike it, act ii. se. 7.
-P-A-G-E-133
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 113 
Then we have the stage of strong emotion in 
“the lover, 
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad 
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow.” 
In early manhood there is overflowing energy in the 
* soldier, 
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, 
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, 
Seeking the bubble reputation 
Even in the cannon’s mouth.” 
Then comes the age of sage counsel pictured in 
“the justice, 
In fair round belly with good capon lined, 
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, 
Full of wise saws and modern instances.” 
Nevertheless, throughout each life this sequence is shown 
inwayscharacteristic of one or other temperament. The 
difference of nature is innate, and can be traced under- 
lying the variations due to age. Some people retain 
throughout life the vivacity and inconsequence of child- 
hood; some children show much of the sedateness of 
maturity. These are the more extreme cases, but such 
differences are always apparent in some degree. As we 
Pass through life we show in turn some of the character- 
istics of each temperament, but always in terms of that 
temperament in which our nature is moulded. 
When we seek to base a classification of tempera- 
ments on modern physiological knowledge we are met 
by difficulties at present unconquered. That differences 
in temperament depend on differences in bodily organi- 
vation may be taken as established, but what exactly 
w H
-P-A-G-E-134
114 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
those differences are is an extremely difficult and obscure 
question : various hypotheses have been suggested, but 
all have been met by serious objections. We are, there- 
fore, driven back on empirical observation and generaliza- 
tion. Here the divisions of the traditional scheme will \ 
serve as a basis, though we shall not adhere closely to 
them. The traditional temperaments do distinguish the 
modes in which various people meet the calls of life. 
The sanguine or volatile react rapidly but without any 
continuing force, the phlegmatic slowly and feebly, the 
choleric rapidly and strongly, the melancholic slowly and 
strongly. The beginnings of such differences are seen 
among children at quite an early age, and they become 
accentuated as life advances. 
We all know the child of quick apprehension but 
feeble retentiveness, him who is forward to perform 
immediate service but who soon tires, him of quick but 
shallow sympathies. In a word, the sanguine person is 
responsive and fickle. There must be a good deal of 
this in every child just because everything is so new to 
him, and experience has not taught him which things are 
of most worth. But in an adult the predominance of these 
characteristics is a sign of some arrest of mental develop- 
ment, whether it be due to innate defect or to defective 
training or to both. The mind is a childish mind, no 
matter what the age may be. 
Quick and strong reaction implies that the individual 
is always ready to be up and doing—to meet the situa 
tions of life with energy. To see an evil is to long to do 
something to remedy it. The impulse to act is strong 
enough to induce action without much previous time 
given to deciding whether to act or not. This is the 
basis of the practical man. He must act, but mere action
-P-A-G-E-135
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT irs 
does not satisfy him. He requires further that it be 
successful action. 
Of course, this active nature may be united with all 
degrees of intelligence, as well as with considerable 
strength of the more outward-looking emotions. The 
instinct of pugnacity is strongly developed in it; and, 
as we have seen, this instinct is often found in close ~ 
relation with those of altruism and love. But the intel- 
ligence is dominated by the practical outlook. Thought 
for its own sake no more appeals than does emotional 
dreaming. The essential characteristic is that the man 
or boy wants to be up and doing. These are the boys 
who delight in all forms of bodily skill, whether in games 
orin manual work. In school lessons they often do not 
delight, just because the fundamental spring of their 
natures finds little in those lessons to which it can 
respond. 
The practical temperament, then, is marked not only 
by the predominance of will but also by the direction of 
will. There is concentration of energy in great strength, 
but it is centred on some practical result, not on the 
solution of a theoretical problem. In pursuit of its 
purpose it may become hard and callous. When the 
altruistic emotions are not operative and the instinct of 
slf-assertion is united with that of pugnacity, the prac- 
tical person is apt to press forward to his own ends, 
ttampling down on his way the feelings and the rights of 
others, 
Further, when this strong and practical temperament 
is of only low intelligence the will often shows as 
obstinacy. A path once entered on is pursued just 
because it has been entered on, even though experience 
shows it to be an unwise one. Here, it is evident, self-
-P-A-G-E-136
116 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
assertion dominates pugnacity. Obstacles are attacked, 
not because they are in the way of the external 
purpose, but because they are in the way of the will. 
A similar obstinacy is-often shown without any marked 
strength of purpose, especially by children who in their 
earliest years have not been subjected to a judicious 
discipline. The attainment of anything on which such 
a child sets its capricious desires is to him a personal 
matter, in the sense that a feeling of deliberate and inten- 
tional personal injury arises if the attainment be hindered 
by the act of another. Here again is apparent an un- 
desirable strength in the instinct of self-assertion. 
When this kind of self-will appears in the sanguine or 
volatile child it can usually be much modified by a kindly 
but firm discipline. But when it is united with strength 
and persistence the product is the sullen child whom 
it is impossible to drive and very difficult to lead. The 
natural defect is primarily emotional but often secondarily 
intellectual. The line of treatment is thus indicated, 
though the carrying it out in any case is not likely to be 
at all easy. 
The ‘contrary’? boy is a rather extreme, but by 10 
means very uncommon, type of the self-willed. He is 
one of those people whom nature seems to have designed 
to be in permanent opposition. There may be con- 
siderable intelligence, though it is generally of a narrow 
type. But the peculiarity is that the line taken by such 
a person is largely determined by his surroundings, 
though determined negatively. The surest way to 
secure that he does something is to command him not 
to doit. Great care is obviously needed in dealing with 
such natures to suggest rather than to command when- 
ever it is possible, and when it is not to see that the
-P-A-G-E-137
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 117 
command be reasonable and be made as little private in 
its application as possible. For, it may be noted, certain 
people have a way of issuing commands, and even of 
giving advice, that would induce a worm to turn. Ifa 
parent or a teacher finds that his suggestions to children 
generally produce opposition, he had better seek “the 
fountain and origin of the evil” in himself. 
The traditional school provides little opportunity for 
the essentially practical child to show what is in him. 
If he be intelligent as well as practical he does pretty 
well at lessons, and is probably sent when school is over 
to some sedentary occupation which suits him not at all, 
and which really mars his life. If he be only practical— 
dever only with his hands—he is condemned as a dunce. 
Yet there may be in him the potentiality of a fine crafts- 
man, For there is no real test in school lessons as to 
whether the practical child’s apparent want of intelligence 
isa real deficiency, or only a limitation of range. He 
may be dull at lessons and yet capable of a very high 
order of intelligence in practical work. 
Is there not a call that schools of all grades should 
make adequate provision for the practical natures among 
their scholars? Not on the ground that they are inferior 
to those who learn the traditional lessons more readily, 
but on the ground that they are different. Have they 
not a tight to the training that will develop their 
Capacities, and is it not a waste in every sense of the word 
to insist on confining them to one which does not, and 
cannot, make the most and the best of their powers? 
It surely would be possible in most places, and easy in 
large towns, to have either special ‘sides? for all children 
above eleven or twelve years of age, or special schools 
‘a which the practical children, while not neglecting
-P-A-G-E-138
118 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
studies which call forth the emotions and the imagi- 
nation, should yet spend a large proportion of their time 
in various forms of practical pursuits, and should do their 
thinking with their hands as well as with their heads. 
When the response to impressions is slow and yet 
strong there is implied a considerable amount of internal 
elaboration, which may, indeed, be itself the chief element 
in the reaction. This may be either emotional or intel- 
lectual. In the former case we have a temperament 
which may be styled emotional or sensitive, in the latter 
one which is appropriately named contemplative. 
When impulses from without do not lead to definite 
activity, but spend themselves in the inner life itself, we 
have the nature which lives essentially in its emotions. 
This mental type is usually conjoined with a highly 
strung nervous system, so that it is generally spoken of 
by doctors as the nervous temperament. It would seem 
probable that the sensory excitations discharge into those 
parts of the brain-cortex which are closely connected with 
the organic life of the body rather than with the motor 
areas. 
It is evident that such a life as this is more moulded by 
its surroundings than is the practical nature. It may, 
indeed, show bursts of energy, but they seldom last long. 
The key-note of the temperament is that perseverance— 
which means disregard of present impressions—is want- 
ing. ‘The emotional person is easily roused to fury, and 
in the first impulse of that passion may take up some 
course of action with great vigour, but it soon dies dows. 
The emotions are sincere enough, but they do not find 
their true outlet in action. 
The operations of intelligence in an emotional tem- 
perament are given a certain form by the prevailing caste
-P-A-G-E-139
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 119 
of mind. Things and persons are esteemed chiefly 
according to their value for the feelings. This is apt to 
affect the view as to their worth as elements of know- 
ledge. We all know how facts are distorted by the pre~ 
judices and preferences of even the most level-headed. 
Much more is it so when feeling is the very core of life. 
When the intelligence is great and original in type this 
working within the realm of feeling gives the artistic 
temperament. The artist or the poet sees things 
diferently from other men because, though he also looks 
at them from a practical or a theoretical standpoint, yet 
he sees into their relations to the innermost sanctuary 
of the heart. So he often reveals to us what otherwise 
we should never see. 
“For, don’t you mark ? we’re made so that we love 
First when we see them painted, things we have passed 
Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see ; 
And so they are better, painted—better to us, 
Which is the same thing. Art was given for that; 
God uses us to help each other so, 
Lending our minds out.” 
When the intelligence is small, either absolutely or 
telatively to the strength of the emotional tendency, we 
have sentimentalism, which is near or over the verge 
which separates the healthy from the pathological in 
mental life. Then we have dreamy sentiment and 
morbid self-consciousness—a brooding over imaginary 
joys and sorrows, a heart which feeds on itself, and is so 
satisfied with unrealities that life becomes a mere world 
of shadows. In the sphere of conduct this shows: itself 
ina weak power of self-control, in a constant yielding to 
the solicitations of the moment.

120 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
It is evident that in trying to prune the excrescences 
and exuberances of an emotional temperament great care 
is needed lest the delicate bloom of fancy and the fine 
flower of sensitive feeling be also lopped off. It is not 
the depth and delicacy of feeling that education should 
seek to lessen. On the contrary, it should aim a 
making these more real by bringing them into actual and 
close contact with the joys and sorrows of life. En 
couragement of action so as to avoid unhealthy intro- 
spection and dreaming is the true path. Especially 
needful is this in the years of adolescence when the 
emotional nature is generally more insistent than at other 
periods. 
As it seems advisable that the practical natures should 
receive a good deal of their training through theit 
practical activities, so the children who show signs of 
artistic or literary talent should be given abundant means 
and opportunities for its development. 
When the response to suggestions from without takes 
the general form of intellectual enquiry we have the con- 
templative nature. There is no lack of activity, but it 
is mental rather than bodily. The feelings and emotions 
are calm, but they may be intense ; they do not easily 
interrupt the train of thought, but they may determine 
its course. 
' The cold intellectual person is certainly somewhat 
unattractive in youth or in age, yet he may do much for 
the world by enriching it with thoughts of the utmost 
value. He is better for the community in general and 
for posterity than for those of his contemporaries who 
have to live with him. But though the contemplative 
temperament is never gushing it is quite compatible with 
warmth of heart and a genuine regard for others—#
-P-A-G-E-141
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 121 
regard, moreover, which is likely to live on unchanged 
through all the vicissitudes of intercourse, for it is 
founded on the rock of conviction of worth not on the 
shifting sand of transitory feeling. 
The thoughtful child is apt to reply to questions and to 
arrive at conclusions much less quickly than his sanguine 
companion, but his results are generally sounder, and 
are based on reasons satisfactory and clear to his own 
mind: they are not mere guesses at truth or hasty 
intuitions. So when a child of this temperament gives 
a mistaken explanation or reaches an invalid conclusion, 
it is always worth the teacher’s while to trace back the 
train of thought till the initial error is laid bare. But 
the unconsidered answers of the quick and superficial 
child of sanguine temperament seldom repay investiga- 
tion. This was excellently put by Roger Ascham—an 
illustration, by the way, that the application of real prac- 
tical psychology to education is not so modern as many

The child who at first view appears by his brightness 
and quickness in response the most intelligent is on 
further acquaintance more likely to show the inconstant 
sanguine temperament which Ascham so scathingly 
described than to be really thoughtful and intellectually 
capable. But not always. The distribution of marks is 
not always slow and deep against quick and shallow. 
There are intellects, and those of the very first order, 
which are both quick and deep. ‘These are the penetrat- 
ing minds that see at once into the hearts of things 
True, they are rare; but one would be mistaken who 
should suppose that by measuring the time two children 
take to reach a result he has an inverse measure of the 
solidity of their intellects. The slow and shallow child 
is not unknown—nor is the slow and shallow man. 
Still waters run deep”, but a very shallow pool 
may also be still. 
Extreme cases of mental incapacity are recognized #8 
abnormal and are provided for in special schools. Ought 
not suitable provision to be made also for those who att 
abnormal in the other direction—those children of excep 
tional ability who now gain so little from our schools? 
True, they are at the head of their forms, but they ate 
1 The Scholemaster.

VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 123 
there without serious effort. Thus the school does not 
all forth their capacity. Nor is the plan of promoting 
them more rapidly than usual satisfactory, any more than 
the analogous plan of slower promotion would meet the 
case of the abnormally dull. They need a mental diet 
which would cause chronic mental dyspepsia in their 
class-mates. Without this they not only do not gain 
the knowledge they should, but, what is of infinitely 
more importance, they are learning the worst of all lessons 
—that real work is not needful. So they are trained 
to become vain and idle. Thus it may very well be that 
the school spoils its best material, and yet rests satisfied 
because the very material it is spoiling makes at present 
its fairest show. The idea of the provision in all our 
large towns of special schools for the specially gifted as 
well as for the specially deficient is worthy of considera- 
tion, It seems deplorable that while money and care are 
lavished on those who can never do much in the world, 
nothing more is done for those who are capable of the 
highest and best service than is done for the ordinary 
Capacities which will always do hodman’s work. No 
one, of course, can suppose that our present system of 
Promotion to secondary schools at all meets the case: the 
Standard of ability for admission is far too low. Indeed, 
itis true to say that, speaking generally, the average 
“Apacity in a school is not a function of its rank. It is 
interesting to note that M. Binet in his recent work 
Les Idtes modernes sur les enfants advocates such pro- 
vision, As he pertinently says, ‘‘A child of superior 
intelligence is a force which should not be wasted.” ! 
We now turn to consider the saddest and most hope- 
less cases with which the educator has to deal—the 
1p. rog,
-P-A-G-E-144
124 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
apathetic. The old classification included under the “phlegmatic’ both this and the contemplative nature. 
Yet there is a great inner difference between them, 
though outwardly they may agree in showing a certain 
bodily inertia, With the intellectual person that inertia 
co-exists with a very intense vitality of thought. But 
the apathetic child shows a general sluggishness of mind. 
Frequently this is conjoined with a general lowness of 
physical tone. There is a want of vital vigour, express- 
ing itself in both mental and bodily inertia. Here we 
have not a normal nature at all, but one defective in life. 
Sometimes the weakness is innate ; then in the strict sense 
of the words we have the apathetic temperament. More 
often the temperament is less the original nature than that 
‘second nature’ which comes from constant habit. It is 
due ‘to unfavourable conditions of life and is modified 
when those conditions are changed, though it is plain 
that the longer the change is delayed the less modification 
in the child’s nature will follow. : 
This is all plain sailing. But we hear of apathetic 
children whose bodily health and strength leave nothing 
to be desired. That some children in vigorous health 
are apathetic over their school lessons is certain, and it 
may be suspected that this is what is meant. One wants 
to know whether the same apathy is shown outside 
school. If not there is clear proof that the school is 
doing that particular child little or no good. Fora child 
profits by his school work just in proportion as it calls out 
some form of energy. But if the apathy extend both 
to games and to other forms of outdoor pursuits as well 
as to lessons, then it is surely time to consult a medical 
man. Muscles and flesh may look robust to the un 
skilled observer, and yet there may be organic defect.
-P-A-G-E-145
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 125 
To healthy children activity is natural. Even the con- 
templative child should love to play as well as to think. 
“In the early period of life...to suspend the mental 
cheerfulness, for any length of time, is as difficult as to 
keep fixed, for any length of time, those muscles to 
which exercise is almost a species of repose, and repose 
itself fatigue.” ! 
It is evident that such a survey of types as we have just 
made is of worth only as suggestive. Nor is tempera- 
ment in one sense unalterable. It is probably true that 
the form cannot be changed: that both the absolute and 
the relative strength of will, emotion, and thought, are 
immutable. But the direction and the nourishment of 
the inborn nature are given from without. It is here 
that the power of the school for good or for evil comes 
in, Temperament is the basis of character, but on that 
basis many a superstructure may be raised. Tempera- 
ment also fixes the limit of possible development for the 
individual; but education is responsible for his reach- 
ing that limit, or at least drawing near to it. 
In considering temperaments we are occupied with the 
relative strengths of the fundamental factors of mental 
lif. But will, feeling, and thought vary not only 
in their absolute and relative strengths but also in their 
mode of dealing with the things of life. It may, then, 
be profitable to note some of the most important formal 
matks of activity under each head. We will give the 
characteristics in pairs, but it must be clearly understood 
that the first member of any pair can be joined with the 
second member of any other pair which is not incom- 
patible with it; that any number of the qualities under 
tach head may be conjoined, and that in any strength ; 
1Brown : Philosophy of the Human Mind, Lects 526
-P-A-G-E-146
126 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
and that similar combinations of qualities under the 
separate heads are to be found. Indeed, every permuta- 
tion and combination of the qualities given which is 
not self-contradictory is not only possible but actual. 
Under will we may enquire whether the child is docile 
or stubborn, active or inert, persevering or unstable ; or, 
combining these three pairs in one, industrious or idle; 
lastly whether he is directive or executive, that is, 
whether his energy sets its own ends or accepts the ends 
set by others. When origination is combined with 
industry we have the finest type of the practical will. 
Under feeling it may be asked whether the individual 
has sympathy and kindliness or is selfish and self-centred, 
whether his feelings are easily raised or are dull and 
stagnant, whether he meets situations boldly or is kept 
back by timidity, whether his temper is equable or 
irascible and variable, perhaps even violent, whether 
he is generally cheerful or sullen, whether he is idealistic 
or materialistic in choice of objects on which to lavish 
his affections. 
Under intellect the most pertinent questions seem to be 
whether the intelligence is deep and thoughtful or shallow 
and superficial, whether it is quick or slow, whether itis 
retentive or elusive. Again combining these three pairs 
we get on the one hand the person of superior mental 
ability and on the other the stupid person. Lastly, in 
harmony with the last pair under each of the other heads, 
we have the distinction between the inventive and 
originative intellect and that which is merely receptive, 
interpretative, and reproductive. 
Temperament refers to the mode in which the indi- 
vidual reacts on his surroundings. From this must be 
distinguished disposition, which is the general product
-P-A-G-E-147
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 127 
of his emotional tendencies. Thus we speak of a cheer- 
fal or a gloomy disposition, but not of a cheerful or a 
gloomy temperament ; of an active or emotional tempera- 
ment, but not of an active or emotional disposition. 
Disposition is the resultant of the composition of 
instincts regarded as modes of feeling : temperament the 
resultant of them regarded as types of reaction. 
Disposition does much to shape life. Whether a 
person has a kindly or a morose disposition, whether he 
views events and people through smoked glasses, 
through rose-coloured spectacles, or in the clear light of 
reality, not only affects his inner life, but does much to 
decide the form and the amount of his activity, both 
mental and physical. Our feelings cannot be separated 
ftom our thoughts and our actions. So, throughout life 
disposition as well as temperament is operative. Nor 
tan innate disposition be absolutely changed, though 
doubtless it can be modified by the firm exercise of the 
personal will. We can inhibit the impulses in which one 
emotion manifests itself and give free play to those 
Which spring from an emotion of opposite character. 
Whatever is refused expression becomes atrophied ; 
whatever is encouraged increases in strength. Thus a 
great change can, by perseverance, be wrought in our 
outward behaviour, and, through that, a less though 
very real change in the inner disposition itself. But the 
natural pessimist never becomes a real optimist, nor can 
continuous disappointment destroy the buoyant disposi- 
tion of the born optimist. 
_ Underlying differences of temperament and disposi- 
tion is the yet more fundamental distinction of sex. It 
is not so much that the various temperaments and 
dispositions are found in different proportions in the two
-P-A-G-E-148
128 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
sexes, as that the same temperament or disposition shows 
important variations in men and women. Tempera- 
ment and disposition are embedded in sex and developed 
in sex. 
The profound physiological differences which distin- 
guish the sexes are the correlates of equally important 
mental differences. Nor is the one unlikeness any more 
than the other merely the result of unlike training and 
education. The functions of men and women in the 
world are, and always have been, essentially distinct. 
Now, the whole course of evolution makes clear that 
progress involves increasing differentiation of function, 
and consequent increasing divergencies of organization. 
So that the higher the level reached, either by indi- 
viduals or by societies, the more strongly marked become 
essential differences, Neither the obscuring nor the 
attrition of differences due to sex can, then, be expected, 
unless the future retrograde from civilization towards 
savagery. Among savages the distinctions are less 
marked than among peoples which have advanced far on 
the road of civilization, and among the lower animals 
they are still less emphatic. It is not the identification 
of sex qualities to which evolution points the way, but to 
their more perfect mutual adaptation. Equality i 
value of complementary functions, not the obscuring of 
differences already established, is what the whole course 
of man’s evolution leads us to expect. 
Speaking generally, woman’s outlook on the world is 
more determined by feeling than is that of man. She 
approximates the emotional temperament even when she 
does not show it in all its fullness. It follows that she 
regards things and events as wholes which have a value 
for feeling. She is more sensitive to their beauty and to
-P-A-G-E-149
ane CF VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 129 
their harmony with their surroundings than isman. On 
the other hand, she does not care for abstract thought. 
It is not that she does not generalize, but that she 
generalizes without preparatory analysis, and, conse~ 
quently, often wildly. This dislike for the exact logical 
analysis by which man reaches science is one of the most 
characteristic intellectual differences between the sexes. 
Even so able a woman as Mme. de Sévigné acknow- 
Iedged that “‘abstract reasonings were repugnant to 
her”! Here is the root of the difference between the 
reasoning of man and of woman. Man analyses and 
applies principles deductively ; woman takes the special 
wase and its value for feeling. Hence she is less judicial 
than man in the sense of a rigid application of Jaw. Yet 
she may reach substantial justice when man fails to do so, 
for general principles can never exhaust a concrete case. 
So, man’s justice often seems unjust to woman, and 
Woman’s justice appears to man as mere caprice, because 
te cannot reduce it to rule. 
These intellectual differences between the sexes have 
been well and picturesquely put by the late Mr. F. Marion 
Crawford: “There must be some original reason why 
all boys call girls silly, and all girls think boys stupid. 
It must be part of the first manifestation of that 
tnormous difference which exists between the point of 
view of men and women in after life. 
“Women are, in a sense, the embodiment of practice, 
While men are the representatives of theory. In prac- 
tice, in a race for life, the runner who jumps everything 
in his way is always right, unless he breaks his neck. In 
theory, he is as likely to break his neck at the first jump 
48 at the second, and the chances of his coming to grief 
’ Quoted by Fouillée : Tempérament et Caractere, p. 237. 
. I
-P-A-G-E-150
increase quickly, always in theory, as he grows tired. So 
theory says it is safer never to jump at all but to go round 
through the gates, or wade ignominiously through the 
water. Women jump; men goround. The difference 
is everything. Women believe in what often succeeds 
in practice, and they take all risks and sometimes come 
down with a crash. Men theorize about danger, make | 130 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION | 
elaborate calculations to avoid it, and occasionally stick 
in the mud. When women fall at a stone wall they 
scream, when men are stuck in a bog they swear. The 
difference is fundamental.” ! 
The characteristic concrete outlook of woman causes 
her estimate of truth to be different from that of man. 
The true is to woman the harmonious—to man the 
actual. In other words, woman sees things and events 
differently from man, and consequently both thinks and 
reports them differently. She cares more for the look of 
things, less for their intrinsic nature. This is shown in 
small matters by her liking for sham jewellery, and for 
imitations generally, when the real is not easily obtainable. 
The point with her is that their effect harmonizes with 
their setting. So, too, the tendency to tell ‘ white lies’ 
which represent her conduct as more harmonious and 
more consonant with the wishes or ideas of her hearer 
than it really has been ; often, no doubt, more consonant 
also with her general idea of herself. 
From the general greater impressionability of woman 
by her surroundings it follows that she has less initiative 
than man. It is not that she necessarily has a weaker / 
will, but that her strength of will is rather passive thaa 
active. She may be strong in resistance, but she is 
seldom strong asa leader. This is, doubtless, related to 
i ' The Heart of Rome, ch. 5.
-P-A-G-E-151
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 131 
her inferior muscular strength and to her superior 
physical power of enduring long continued pain and. 
privation. Woman makes a good executant, but she 
has produced scarcely any original work of the first rank, 
especially in science and mechanical invention, where the 
abstract analysis which is so foreign to her is indis- 
pensable. Woman, indeed, accepts the customary 
without question. The continually recurring events in 
nature do not come before her mind as problems but as 
agreeable or disagreeable experiences. 
In the union of impressionability and power of endur- 
ance may be found the source of that devoted patience 
and that tender sympathy which combine to make woman 
so generally superior to man as nurse in sickness and 
comforter in sorrow. 
Many other consequences could be instanced of the 
fundamental differences between the outlooks of the two 
sexes, but enough has probably been said to bring home 
the point that in every relation of life there is a diverg- 
ence between the attitude of man and woman. 
The differences, however, are in kind, not in rank. As 
M. Fouillée says: ‘The intellectual instinct of woman 
does not result from the inferiority of her evolution, but 
ftom the meaning and the normal direction of that 
evolution itself. ‘Woman has not ‘remained behind’, 
she has advanced, but in the direction which her nature 
imposes on her.” ! 
To measure woman’s intellect by that of man, and to 
deduce mental inferiority from woman’s inaptitude for 
abstract thought is to apply a false standard and to reach 
a wrong conclusion. To value general principles and 
to value concrete wholes are different, but neither is 
1p. cit. p. 238 note.
-P-A-G-E-152
132 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
inferior to the other. Each is essential in life, and in 
this difference of attitude, as in all that follows from it, 
man and woman are complementary. There is no ques- 
tion of superiority or inferiority, and any course of action 
based on the assumption that woman should try to 
become intellectually like man rests on a very insecure 
psychological foundation. 
Like all differences between human beings, those due 
to sex become accentuated as childhood passes into 
maturity. Between young infants there are few differ- 
ences of any kind, and those vague and indecisive, and 
the younger the babe the more it is like other babies. 
Quite early in life, however, the fundamental character- 
istics which distinguish the sexes begin to appear. A 
little girl of four is essentially a little girl; a little boy 
is a little boy. Nor could any but the most casual 
observer confuse them, even though the results of the 
differences lack that precision which increasingly marks 
them as the years pass on. The girl is usually more 
precocious in speech than the boy, and is less often 
troubled with stammering. The neural connexions 
which govern speech are matured in her earlier than in 
her brother. She already plays differently from the boy 
when playing by herself or with other girls. Her 
play lacks the force and the expansion of movement 
which characterizes the boy’s; it is quieter, and sooner 
shows a definite meaning. The girl reaches the stage 
of imitative play earlier than the boy and persists in it 
longer. She delights in dolls’ parties, in nursing ‘baby’ 
and putting him to bed, in keeping school. Here the 
susceptibility to outside influences shows itself in the 
most spontaneous form. Afterwards it will lead her to 
dress according to the fashion in all its possible vagaries
-P-A-G-E-153
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 133 
of ugliness as well as in its occasional deviations into 
beauty. 
It is noticeable that this same susceptibility shows 
itself in greater demonstrativeness on the part of the 
gil From an early age she cries and laughs more than 
the boy, and, generally, gives more violent outward 
expression to her feelings. Any one who has remarked 
the conduct of adolescent girls who have not been 
trained to self-control will have been impressed by their 
apparent inability to inhibit nearly all modes of muscular 
movement when they are amused. They laugh with 
the whole body and with intermittent shrieks and 
squeaks, 
The differences in the expression of will are also 
plain in childhood. The boy becomes violent when 
opposed ; the girl sulks. That is the tendency, though, 
of course, in neither case is it always actualized. Passive 
Tesistance is the refuge of the girl; active aggression the 
solace of the boy. 
In their mutual relations, too, girls differ from boys. 
Boys fight ; girls nag. The sequel to a fight is a hearty 
hand-shake and a re-established friendship. But with 
gitls the tendency to inwardness of life expresses itself 
in brooding over the offence, and this at times develops 
into a seeking for revenge by ways which a boy would 
stigmatize as mean and sneaking. Emulation among 
gils is more likely to be coloured with envy and to 
lead to dishonourable forms of competition, and more 
apt to prow into a long continuing hatred, than with 
boys. Even quite little girls frequently show ill-feeling 
towards other children who attract notice which they 
desire to be lavished on themselves. 
When we turn to the intellectual distinctions we find
-P-A-G-E-154
134. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
that they colour the learning of the two sexes as soon | 
as the matter studied gives opportunity for the two 
modes of apprehension. Girls do well in all that 
demands neither originality of thought nor abstraction. 
Thus, they quite keep pace with boys, or even surpas 
them, in the earlier school studies, which deal essentially 
with concrete wholes. They learn by heart with ease, f 
they delight in neatness and in the embellishment of their 
written exercises, they work out with accuracy of detail 
processes with the general form of which they are familiar 
or which they can imitate from an example. They 
appreciate beauty of feeling and of form, and so they ; 
can enter with advantage on the study of literature at 
an earlier age than is beneficial to boys. Their earlier 
attempts at composition are superior to those of boys, 
because they are more imitative of what they have read | 
in books, whereas the boy gives direct expression, in 
the briefest and baldest way and in the ordinary colloquial 
language of his life, to what he has to say. He does 
not embroider; girls do. This particularly shows itself 
when the matter in hand is the production of an account 
of an imaginary event. The boy’s story will probably 
lack conviction, and will not improbably be incoherent, 
if not inherently contradictory. The girl will produce 
a much better constructed plot, and it is seldom that 
any striking inconsistency will be found in it. Un 
happily, she is apt to carry this power of romancing 
into real life ; and, when occasion seems to her to demand 
it, to substitute what should have been for what really 
was. Boys lie, but as a rule they lie clumsily; girls 
lie artistically. And much experience and observation 
seem to show that girls lie more frequently than boys 
and from more personal impulses. A girl appears 
L
-P-A-G-E-155
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 135 
seldom to lie to save another, a boy often does. Indeed, 
that is almost the only occasion.on which a decent boy will 
lie. The very want of skill and assurance with which 
boys usually lie, as compared with the ease and grace 
with which girls tell their well-invented fables, is an 
early illustration of that difference between man’s and 
woman’s estimate of truth to which reference has already 
been made. 
It is doubtful whether sufficient attention has been 
paid to such considerations as these by the advocates 
and promoters of joint schools for the sexes. That boys 
and girls may be taught together in the earliest stage— 
say, up to ten years of age—may be granted. The 
matter put before them gives little scope for their char- 
acteristically different modes of apprehension. But the 
farther that early stage is passed, the more do the intel- 
lectual differences of the sexes become operative. Soon 
boys and girls begin to retard each other’s progress— 
the girls being held back for the slower boys in some 
subjects, and, in their turn, hindering the advance of 
the boys in other subjects. Of course, this could be 
met by separating the sexes for all subjects in which 
collective advance is desired. In small schools that may 
be the only alternative to teaching them together. But 
in towns the traditional distinction of schools according 
to sex would seem to give the best intellectual results. 
Certainly, that is very markedly the outcome of my own 
somewhat extended observations. 
There seems, however, to be a yet more serious defect 
in the mixed school as a place of education for all but 
quite young children. It is that, as the psychological 
differences between man and woman are so intimate, so 
deep, and so all-pervading, the real training in character
-P-A-G-E-156
136 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
and in outlook on life of the one sex cannot be given 
by the other. This consideration is especially important 
when the age of adolescence is reached, but it has much 
force years before that. A man cannot be a reilly 
sympathetic guide to a girl, nor a woman to a boy, no 
matter how kindly disposed, simply because the man 
has never himself been a girl nor the woman a boy. 
Neither can find in personal experience the thread which 
leads into the labyrinth, neither has the key to the living 
puzzle. In short, the mixed school seems in this respect 
deliberately to dispense with the most essential of all 
educative instruments. Doubtless, if both men and 
women be employed on the staff, and if each class have 
a fair alternation of men and women teachers, the evil 
may be lessened though not removed. But, as a matter 
of fact, mixed. schools become increasingly officered by 
women. In the United States of America, where such 
schools are nearly universal, considerably over ninety 
per cent. of the teachers are women, and the few men 
are generally principals of large schools. So that, evet 
in the high schools, which are attended wholly or mainly 
by adolescents, the majority of the teachers are women. 
The argument that as nature has made the two sexes 
to live together therefore boys and girls should attend 
the same school, though specious at first sight, has no 
teal force. It ignores the important fact that boys and 
girls need to be trained for very different functions in 
life, and that in fulfilling those functions as men and 
women they will surely not be always together. Thus, 
it may be retorted, not only that single sex schools by 
no means negate the natural association of boys and 
girls in the family circle and among friends, but that 
they train boys to work and compete with boys, and
-P-A-G-E-157
VARIATIONS IN MENTAL ENDOWMENT 137 
girls with girls, without the interference of the other 
sex; and that this, too, is part of the training for life. 
Really, at the bottom of the advocacy of mixed schools 
lies the idea which, for the reasons I have given, I believe 
to be profoundly mistaken, that true evolution means 
the gradual elimination of the differences of sex. "When 
we consider what those differences are, and rid ourselves 
of the suspicion that, intellectually, woman is an imper- 
fectly developed man, and when we remember further 
that women teachers cannot enter into the life of sport 
and games which is so important to the boy and the 
youth, it becomes clear that if mixed schools are to 
be justified it must be on grounds other than psycho- 
logical, and that those grounds must be overwhelmingly 
strong to justify the ignoring of the by no means weak 
psychological objections.

CHAPTER VI 
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 
“Everyruine is in the child and education has only 
to draw it out” is as true—and as false—as ‘‘ Everything 
is outside the child and education has only to put it in” 
Each is true in what it explicitly affirms, and false in 
what it implicitly denies. Each by itself is one of those 
half truths which when they masquerade as whole truths 
are most mischievously false. The former would mea 
that one’s surroundings have no influence on one’s real 
self or on the essentials of one’s life and character; the 
latter that one’s inborn nature is not a determining factor 
in one’s life, but is absolutely plastic to all its surround- 
ings. Rigid adherence to the one would lead to the 
abolition of education altogether, on the ground that it 
could do nothing ; strict application of the other would 
attempt to make its work co-extensive with life. In 
education, however, as in other matters, people do noh 
as a rule, attempt to carry their theories into practice 
with logical implacability. Happy is it for mankind 
that they do not. For a general principle is an abstrat- 
tion, and, as such, omits much in the reality of life. 
Unless practice take account of the omitted elements its 
effects are likely to be disastrous. 
Although this is so, yet these one-sided theories do
-P-A-G-E-159
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 139 
influence both thought and practice. The doctrine that 
human nature develops from within is urged as the 
justification for that fashionable distrust of authority 
which encourages the child as far as possible to follow 
his own inclinations, and tries to bribe him to learn by 
various forms of sugar plums. ‘The hypothesis that man 
is formed by his surroundings leads to an exaggerated 
estimate of what the school can do, and to the traditional 
practice of regarding the scholar’s attitude as one of 
passive receptivity. ‘‘I have no conception of educa- 
tion without instruction” wrote Herbart,! and the 
schoolmaster, with a natural tendency to magnify his 
office, has been only too ready to interpret this narrowly, 
and further to agree with Helvetius that ‘‘ education 
makes us what we are.’??_ Education in accordance with 
each of these hypotheses fails in giving systematic 
training of the will; the former by denial of discipline, 
the latter by limitation of liberty. 
If education is to deal with actual life it must come 
to some clear conclusion as to the parts played in it by 
the inborn nature and by surroundings. To lean now 
to the one extreme theory, now to the other, according 
to the convenience of the moment, is one of those 
practical compromises which may be aptly described as 
acombination of the evil elements in two opposed plans. 
The child, now indulged, now subjected to unaccustomed 
restrictions, is trained neither in self-control nor in . 
strength of will, while his temper is-spoilt and his respect 
for authority destroyed.

influence on life does not, of course, deny that they enter 
into it. But, for it 
“The mind is its own place, and in itself 
Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.”? 
So far we can but feel that there is a noble stoicism in 
the view, an ideal of independence of circumstances 
towards which we can, and should, approach. But the 
theory goes much beyond this. It denies that man’s 
relations with his fellows are essential, or, in other words, 
that his nature is social. It regards each as an inde- 
pendent unit which can enter into many forms of 
combination with other units without internal change. 
Such a person we cannot really imagine, because the 
concept does violence to the human nature in which we 
all share. We-see that our own lives are linked in 
innumerable ways with those of our fellows, that our 
thoughts and hopes are bounded by our associations with 
men and things : 
“ Man is all symmetrie, 
Full of proportions, one limbe to another, 
And all to all the world besides : 
Each part may call the farthest, brother : 
For head with foot hath private amitie, 
And both with moons and tides.” ? 
We cannot cut ourselves off, even in our minds, from 
all our surroundings, simply because no thought, no 
feeling, no desire, would then be left. To be inde- 
pendent of circumstances in the sense of having out 
course unaffected by the allurements and undeterred by 
the hindrances they may offer us is not the same thing

as to be independent of them in the sense that we should 
be what we are had they been other than they have been. 
Nor is the former independence the result of unhelped 
inner growth. The child deprived of external control 
neither resists the allurements of pleasure nor despises 
the obstacles of pain. Each turns him aside, so that his 
life is really developing as a series of reflexes to his 
surroundings. Thus it is that negation of authority in 
early life cultivates subjection to capricious impulse in 
maturity. The basis of the educational mistake is an 
inadequate psychology. 
The opposite theory—that man is formed by his 
surroundings—has never been stated with greater 
lucidity than by Helvetius: ‘ Everything that we have, 
and everything that we are, we owe to the external 
world; nor is man himself aught else but what he is 
made by the objects which surround him.”? 
The external world enters our life most obviously by 
the gates of the senses. In all our relations with external 
things—whether direct or indirect—there is either sen- 
Sttion or reminiscence of sensation. The task was so 
to analyse the whole of our conscious life into these 
sense-elements as to show that it contains nothing else. 
Much ingenuity and great acuteness in analysis have 
been devoted to this; for this hypothesis of the nature 
of mental life was dominant, especially in England and 
France, for more than a century. 
If that analysis could account for all the facts we might 
be driven to accept the hypothesis, however much we 
might feel that it makes man a very poor creature. 
Certainly we could not affirm its falsity. That, how- 
ever, is not the case. It fails most signally to account 
1 De Pesprit, vol. ii. p. 306.
-P-A-G-E-162
142 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
for the most characteristic features of all experience— 
the power of holding persistently to a deliberately 
adopted purpose. Our own consciousness—and that is 
the ultimate court of appeal—tells us that this is the very 
essence of life. But no permutations and combinations 
of sensations, no matter how ingenious and complicated, 
can yield on analysis either the feeling of initiative 
power, or the persistent disregard of sensations for the 
sake of an anticipated future or in accordance with a 
past resolve. The theory reduces man to a reflex auto- 
maton, responding with every appearance of spontaneous 
activity to his surroundings, but really passive all the 
time. What we take for will is, it says, simply the 
victory of one set of impressions, or the memory of 
such a set, over all others. To put it quite frankly, all 
that is to us of the essence of life is a delusion. ‘We 
are such stuff as dreams are made of ” in very sooth. 
But, ingenious theorizing as this may be, it is not psycho- 
logy. Psychology, like other sciences, must adapt its 
hypotheses to the facts, not the facts to its theories. And 
no facts are more stubborn than those we class under 
will—tresolvée, disregard of obstacles, persistence, forti- 
tude, struggle. 
Of course the theory can find no place for the native 
proclivities and inherited differences we discussed in the 
last chapter. It demands a mind like a wax tablet— 
to use Locke’s simile—on which surroundings will trace 
the inscription we call life. This is, of course, to assume 
that all men are born mentally equal. So, with his usual 
consistency, Helvetius wrote: ‘‘I shall conclude that the 
superiority of the understanding is not the produce of 
the temperament nor of the greater or less perfection 
of the senses, nor of an occult quality, but of that well-
-P-A-G-E-163

known cause, education...in which I comprehend the 
situations in which chance has placed them.”? This, 
as was argued in the last chapter, is irreconcilable with 
the actual facts of life. So, by every test known to 
science, the hypothesis that man is merely the creature 
of his circumstances falls to the ground. 
In seeking the true nature of human life we must, 
therefore, accept each of the two aspects as true determin- 
ants. Inborn nature, as we have described it, is a reality. 
The influence upon us of the external world of men 
and things is equally a reality. But the reality of each 
is found only in combination with the other. The 
former alone is mere capacity and proclivity—the promise 
of life, but not -life itself. The latter gives occasion 
for activity, but cannot give it birth. Life is through- 
out that interaction between the individual and his 
surroundings which we call experience. The springs of 
action are from within, whether they be the spontaneous 
Promptings of instinct or the impulsion of matured 
purpose ; the opportunities for action are given by sur- 
toundings. True, we may seek opportunities ; there is 
our free initiative. But unless we find them we cannot 
act; there is external limitation. We may speak of acts 
of thought or of will, of choice and determination, and 
the like, apart from their objects. But these are abstrac- 
tions, If we decide to act, it is in a certain definite 
way, in certain determinate circumstances. If we think, 
it is about some definite element in our experience. 
Everywhere and always we find the filling of the thought 
or of the determination is given from without. From 
within comes the mode in which we deal with the situa- 
1De Phomme, de ses facultés et de son éducation, sect. ii, ch. 1 and 
Recapitulation.
-P-A-G-E-164
144 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
tion. May I so far put it technically as to say that the 
form of experience is from within, the content from 
without? Of course, the two cannot be separated. We 
know no activity apart from surroundings, and we know 
no surroundings apart from our activity. They may 
be distinguished in thought, and the error of each of 
the two theories we have rejected lies in supposing that 
this distinction implies separation in reality. 
It is with such experience that the educator has to 
deal. He is part of the outer factor for each of his 
pupils, and as such, he must try to influence the mode 
in which the inner factor of the child’s nature interacts 
with other elements in the outer factor of his surround- 
ings. 
Certainly, in the constant interaction between nature 
and surroundings the part played by each in determining 
the actual life varies with individuals. That we have 
already seen. The strong nature bends his surroundings 
to his will; the weak is more or less at their mercy. 
But strength of purpose is itself a product of life. We 
may start with the possibility of developing it, but not 
with its actual development. For purpose implies 
experience and the power of using experience in fore- 
sight. So we may say that dominance over surroundings 
comes only with life. 
The relative part in experience of the outer factor 
is, then, greatest in childhood. Yet, even in its earliest 
days, the baby is not a mere passive recipient of impres- 
sions. He puts forth activity to receive them, and by 
activity he responds to them. It is true that such 
activity is at first quite independent of previous experi- 
ence. It is, however, the activity of his inborn nature, 
and the groundwork of experience. When random
-P-A-G-E-165
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 145 
movements are followed by satisfaction of instinct they 
tend to be repeated. When such movements fail to 
atisfy the vague longings of instinct, or lead to positive 
discomfort, they tend to be inhibited. Each experience 
leaves a trace behind it in the nervous system in which 
the reaction has initiated a circuit, and in the mental 
system in vague reminiscence. 
We cannot, indeed, put ourselves in imagination at 
a baby’s mental outlook. We can only judge what it 
is by his acts. Not by isolated movements, for they 
may easily give an accidental appearance of meaning 
which they do not possess, but by the extent to which 
his acts are organized into series with distinguishable 
aims. When we thus study the baby, the mental 
characteristic which stands out most clearly is that, 
far fom recognizing separate sensations and then build- 
ing them up into more and more complex combinations, 
his whole consciousness is a vague sentience. In it are 
at first no distinctions at all, either of things or even 
of himself from his surroundings. The whole course 
of life is a progressive analysis of that primary experience. 
This process goes on throughout by activity. The child 
finds that certain acts bring certain satisfactory results— 
that looking, grasping, carrying to the mouth and suck- 
ing, result in pleasant tasting. The whole set of actions 
adheres together by repetition into a recognition, say 
of sugar, of which afterwards the name is both a con- 
venient label and a permanent bond. Thus, from the 
fist, experience develops as the result of personal activity. 
But the baby’s consciousness is not limited to the 
Parts of his experience which are gradually beginning 
‘ostand out as distinct. ‘These are only little quivering 
Poiats of light in a great plain of misty obscurity. And 
| ¥ K
-P-A-G-E-166
146 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
it is the whole plain which is the child’s life. Though 
its elements are not separated from each other yet he 
feels pain or pleasure, vague impulses and aversion 
all the reactions of his nascent but as yet indefinite 
instincts on the totality of his surroundings. They ar 
part of his conscious life, though only as a vague 
undifferentiated mass. Out of this obscure totality 
arise, slowly but surely, the definite explorations whic 
lead to knowledge. A great step is taken when he 
learns by the results of his actions to distinguish himself 
from his surroundings. ‘That, as it were, cuts the whole 
of his experience into two parts, and makes possible a 
apprehension of the effects of his own efforts. 
To enter in detail into the psychology of the baby 
is outside our scope. But it is obvious that this proces 
of sorting out the elements of his surroundings and of 
learning their relations to himself is a slow one. Itis 
much accelerated when he learns to talk and to under 
stand the speech of others, as he can then profit mort 
fully by their experience. Then, too, he soon becomés 
capable of noting some of the relations of things © 
other things as well as to himself. But if the reader 
will ask himself how much there still is in his dail 
surroundings of which his knowledge is only of a ve 
superficial kind he will grant that the process of clearing 
up experience is one which life is not likely to see cou 
pleted. This means, however, that there is always? 
great deal in our experience on which we are bit 
imperfectly informed. Only to the extent to which # 
‘do know anything can we make definite use of it.

part of life as well as that which has been made explidi 
and clear. This we are apt to ignore both in plannisg oe eS

our own lives and in trying to influence the lives of 
others. We think only of the comparatively narrow 
field of explicit attention and definite purpose. So we 
determine to do something which, when the time comes 
we do not do because we no longer feel the same about 
it, So, too, we expect to regulate the conduct of 
children by appeals to understanding and clear thinking. 
Of course, we are continually disappointed, just because 
with them, even more than with us, that which is clear 
in consciousness now does not long remain so, and even 
while it does is not always the final determinant of 
action. 
Let us examine what this vague background of con- 
Siousness contains. My attention may be strictly 
concentrated on writing this chapter, or my reader’s on 
reading it. Yet there is a vast mass of other life-process 
going on as well. Impressions of all kinds from the 
body itself and, through the sense organs, from the 
surroundings, though not individually strong enough to 
force themselves into notice, are collectively giving a 
colour and a tone to the whole life of the present moment. 
If all the bodily functions be going on well, and the 
surroundings be inoffensive, then I write with a sense 
of ease and freedom very different from the heaviness 
and dullness which mark intellectual effort when the 
bodily organism is deranged or the surroundings uncom- 
fortable, as when, for instance, one feels too cold or too 
warm. Usually the emotional life is thus only dimly 
conscious. Even when a particular emotion fixes itself 
on a perfectly definite object its strength lies largely in 
this mass of undiscriminated experience. 
Further, when we have deliberately made up our 
ttinds to a course of action we do not keep on thinking
-P-A-G-E-168
148 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
and remembering that we have done so. We simply 
go on to do it, and we direct our energies towards its 
accomplishment. The successive steps we take ‘fill our 
minds’ as we say. Yet itis notreally so. They fill only 
the region of clear awareness: behind, in the dim back- 
ground, is the purpose. Though it is not continuously 
in our thoughts yet it guides and determines thos 
thoughts and the actions to which they lead. This 
retirement of the purpose into the background explains 
. why it is not always operative after an interval. The 
new situation may call into play other springs of activity 
to which, deliberately or implicitly, we entrust the 
direction of our conduct. 
Both purpose and emotion, then,—the two great 
springs of action, the higher development of inborn pro- 
pensities—lurk in the background of consciousness. 
They are, as common parlance very well has it, ‘at the 
back of our minds. 
This vague background is the representation in cor 
sciousness of those parts of our surroundings to which 
we are not definitely attending. We must not, how- 
ever, confine this to present impressions. Day after day 
the same general scheme of things is about us. Now 
and then we notice one or other element in it. But, 
as a rule, the vast mass of our daily environment draws 
our attention only when there is some change. Ifa 
picture gets awry, for instance, we remark it, though 
it is by no means sure that we pass on from putting it 
straight to considering its artistic merit. And to most 
of the pictures in our house we may very seldom give 
more than a casual and non-seeing glance. So it may 
be said generally that most of our habitual surroundings 
enter our life only in the dim way of which we a
-P-A-G-E-169
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 149 
speaking. That they do thus enter it makes them pretty 
constant constituents of that dim background which is 
our mood at the moment and, in its prevailing customary 
tone, our disposition. Their effect is, of course, cumu- 
tive; for no impression can be made without modifying 
at once the nervous system and the consciousness that 
corresponds to it. 
Further, in receiving these experiences we are much 
more passive than in those of which we are clearly 
conscious. I cannot, for example, make the aesthetic 
effect of my surroundings different from what it is so 
long as I remain amid those surroundings, and other 
considerations may render that imperative. Evidently 
some environments are much more favourable to the 
growth of a full and rich experience than are others, 
though all give at least some occasion for the exercise 
of all the powers with which the individual is endowed. 
It follows that no man is the same as he would have 
been had he been brought up amid totally different 
swroundings. Take an English baby and let him grow 
up ina Hottentot kraal, and his ideas of life, his modes 
of thinking and of acting, will be very different from 
what they would have been had he lived in England. 
Or take him from the class in which he is born and let 
him be brought up in a family of quite another social 
tank, and again the difference will be real though not 
so marked as in the former case. Surroundings are 
always affecting the dim background of consciousness, 
and so influencing mood and disposition, and instilling 
through the influence of habituation certain standards 
of taste in reference to all the customary things of life. 
A person who grows up and lives amid squalid surround- 
ings and rude manners becomes accustomed to them.
-P-A-G-E-170
iso THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
They fix his standard without conscious thought, and 
that standard governs his own mode of life and behaviour. 
One, on the other hand, who has had the happiness to 
be born and to live in a refined circle, gets with equl 
absence of effort a standard of good breeding. 
Surroundings, then, come as influences into our lives 
both with and without our full knowledge. As giving 
scope for our conscious activity of body and of mind, 
and at the same time limiting it, they enter the fully 
conscious life. As moulding our moods, our disposi- 
tion, and our taste, they enter the sub-conscious life. As 
constituents of the latter they are a powerful factor in 
determining the former. 
In trying to understand the experience, then, of any 
individual, account must be taken not only of his inborn 
nature and of the deliberate attempts made to shape 
it to which we usually restrict the term ‘education’, but 
also of everything which in any way comes into his life. 
The man is the concrete being who has become whit 
he is because of the continuous interaction between his 
inherited nature and the whole of his surroundings 
Some, indeed, have preferred to include this whole 
environment under education. Thus, Rousseau wrote, 
“Education is given by nature, by man, and by things 
‘The internal development of our powers and of our 
organs is the education of nature ; the use we are taught 
to make of this development is the education of man; 
the gaining of our individual experiences of the objects 
which affect us is the education of things.”+ Joho 
Stuart Mill expands the same idea—‘‘ Not only does 
education include whatever we do for ourselves, and 
whatever is done for us by others, for the express purpost 
1 Bmile, livee i,
-P-A-G-E-171
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 1g 
of bringing us somewhat nearer to the perfection of our 
nature; it does more: in its largest acceptation, it 
comprehends even the indirect effects produced on char- 
acter and on the human faculties, by things of which 
the direct purposes are quite different; by laws, by 
forms of government, by the industrial arts, by modes 
of social life ; nay, even by physical facts not dependent 
on human will; by climate, soil, and local position. 
Whatever helps to shape the human being; to make 
the individual what he is, or hinder him from being 
what he is not—is part of his education.” ? 
Obviously, in this wide application ‘education’ 
includes elements which tend to deform as well as those 
which make for improvement. As Mill adds: ‘‘ And 
avery bad education it often is; requiring all that can 
be done by cultivated intelligence and will to counteract 
its tendencies.” 
. It is, I think, generally convenient to use ‘education’ 
in its more customary and restricted sense, because it is 
impossible to give any practical rules to govern the wider 
and vaguer influences on life which are so largely outside 
human control. But in doing so it is vital to remember 
that we are excluding from the term a great deal that 
is formative. In so far as an educator can modify or 
determine any of those factors of experience which are 
hot part of education in the narrower sense, to that 
extent his efforts are indirectly educative. 
By far the most important of the formative influences 
which mould us more or less without our knowledge 
and independently of our will is the general view of 
life, or the public opinion, of the people among whom 
welive. ‘‘In every age it has constituted an important

element of the social life of modern Europe. Who can 
say whence it arises, or how it is formed? We may 
regard it as the especial product of that community of 
interests and feelings which binds together societies; as 
the clearest expression of their inward movements and 
revolutions. It derives its origin and its nutriment 
from hidden sources, and, requiring little support from 
reason or from evidence, takes possession of the minds 
of men by involuntary conviction. Yet its apparent 
uniformity is in fact confined to the most general out- 
lines ; for in the innumerable circles, wide and nartow, 
of which human society is composed, it reappears under 
forms the most various and peculiar. New observations 
and new experiments are constantly flowing into it; 
original minds are ever arising, which, affected by its 
course, but not borne along by its stream, react forcibly 
upon it; and thus it is in a state of incessant flux and 
metamorphosis. It is sometimes more, sometimes less, 
in accordance with truth and justice ; being rather a 
tendency of social life and an impulse of the moment, 
than a fixed system.” ! 
The minds which are at once original and powerful 
are few. Consequently, most adults and all children and 
youths owe to their human environment much mote 
than they give to it. Within the broad general limits 
of accepted custom they may shape their own lives, but 
they never escape the moulding restraint of the com 
munity. 
When we turn to more specific classes of surroundings 
we have as the chief differences those of social class and 
of locality. Neither can, as a rule, be changed by the 
individual educator. Yet it is well that he should 
VRanke : History of the Popes, tr. by S, Austin, vol. i, p. 38.

NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 153 
recognize the kinds of modification of development 
which naturally result from such differences in environ- 
ment. 
Of the former mention has already been made. It 
affects the bodily health and development, the general 
outlook on life, and the conception of the relation of 
the individual to his fellows. Careful measurements 
show that children in elementary schools are appreciably 
less in height, in weight, and in general vital power, 
than those of similar age in schools which draw their 
pupils from the wealthier classes; and that children in 
the country are in these points superior to those in the 
towns, though in a less degree. 
Obviously, in very poor homes the town child is at 
a disadvantage as compared with the young countryman. 
The latter at least gets fresh air, one of the necessaries 
of a healthy life, in much greater quantity and of much 
purer quality than does the former. 
It is, however, a common opinion that the town is 
at least as much superior for mental life as is the country 
for physical life. All considerations of mental develop- 
ment lead me to the opposite conclusion. For, putting on 
one side the close relation between physical vigour and 
mental vitality, it may be pointed out that the country 
ismore favourable to manifold activity than is the town. 
Through the varied dealings with things which fill much 
of the life of a country child while the town child is 
idling round street corners or playing in the gutter, the 
former learns much. Again, the wide vistas of the 
country are more favourable to the cultivation of good 
tyesight than are the cramped spaces of the town. Like 
every other organ the eye develops by exercise, and when 
Practically the only long outlook available is up into
-P-A-G-E-174
154 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
the sky, the natural result is some degree of near- 
sightedness. Doubtless the country school does as 
much as the town school to injure eyesight. In each 
children are too exclusively engaged in reading and 
writing, and in each there is far too little insistence that 
the eye shall be kept at a distance from the page which 
minimizes the evil. But the country offers compensa- 
tions which the town does not. Whoever will consider 
how much of our knowledge of the external world comes 
to us through sight will at once see that this limita- 
tion of vision is a mental loss as well as a physical 
injury. 
If it be considered further how the life of intelligence 
and purpose develops by the gradual sorting-out of the 
items of experience, it will be apparent that a smaller 
number of impressions continually repeated is mort 
desirable than a larger number constantly changing. 
Here, again, the country or small quiet town has an 
advantage over the large town. (The town child is 
acquainted with more persons and things, but he knows 
less about them. \So grows up that superficiality and 
shallowness, leadirig often, even as early as adolescence, 
to the feeling that nothing is worth much trouble and 
that all has been experienced, which increasingly char- 
actetizes our town youth. “Children whose first 
remembrances ate full of new impressions grow old 
quickly, while those to whose perceptions little is offered 
grow up more slowly and more naturally. Other con- 
ditions being the same, these latter will be calmer, 
healthier, and more reasonable.” ! 
The guickness of the town child is more than compen- 
sated by the greater solidity of the country boy or girl

It is a case of Ascham’s “‘quicke and hard wittes”, 
artificially induced by surroundings. 
Morally, as well as intellectually and physically, the 
country is preferable for a child. ‘He knows few people, 
. but he knows all he meets and he learns to sympathize 
with them. /The town child, though he lives amid the 
citizen crowd, yet knows and cares for few. In the 
country the young boy or girl is not an unregarded unit 
to the great majority of the people he meets, but to 
the town child it has never been matter of surprise 
“how men lived 
Even next-door neighbours, as we say, yet still 
Strangers, not knowing each the other’s name.” 1! 
The village child grows up in some consciousness of the 
brotherhood of man; on the town child is much more 
impressed a selfish ignoring of others. 
Doubtless country life is open to the danger of stag- 
nation and narrowness of interest. But these are evils 
for the adult rather than for the child. Life needs to 
be deep before it is broad, or its breadth is but shallow- 
hess, 
All such arguments as these are in favour of the 
position that the bustle of a large city is the worst 
environment in which a child can be brought up. 
Probably a small town is best of all, as it widens experi- 
ence without scattering it. 
It is now evident that surroundings count for much 
in life. Were it not so man could learn little from his 
fellows, They do not count for all, because human 
nature is essentially active. In addition to the instinc- 
tive proclivities discussed in an earlier chapter, we are 
1 Wordsworth : The Prelude, bk. vii. ll. 116-118,

all born with an innate tendency to become like our 
‘fellows. This has of late years been called by some the 
instinct of imitation, and the application of the term 
has been stretched so widely that practically the whole 
of mental life is included in it. But the very generality 
of the tendency removes it from the class of true instincts, 
all. of which have a definite emotional centre, as well 
as more or less defined modes of reception and reaction. 
In contrast with this, the assimilative tendency appears 
in activities of all kinds, and is devoid of characteristic 
emotional tone. It is preferable, then, to regard it as an 
innate tendency and not an instinct. 
The wide extension of the term ‘imitation? is open 
to more serious objections both psychological and edu- 
cational. Imitation thus used, is essentially a judgement 
of the observer passed on actions because of theit 
resemblance to actions previously perceived by the actor. 
From this external standpoint it is evident that at least 
an element of imitation can be found in all we do. But 
when we turn from this external character of the acts 
to their meaning in the life of the actor we find that the 
similarity has disappeared. Except, perhaps, in early 
life, to make a copy is seldom the object in view, and 
only in so far as it is can the act be classed as imitative 
in intention. Psychologically what is needed is an 
examination of the internal springs of action, not an 
obscuring of their differences because of an entirely 
external and, it may be, accidental resemblance. Nor is 
it convenient to depart so far from the ordinary use of 
words’ as to speak of imitating the thoughts, desires, 
and resolutions of another ; or to say that each successive 
time we do an action we imitate our previous efforts. 
Still further is it removed from the language of the plain
-P-A-G-E-177
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 157 
man to call the formulation of a scientific law an imitation 
in thought of the workings of nature. 
Educationally also the wide and loose use of the term 
is unfortunate. For one of the most important and 
difficult tasks education has to perform is to decide how © 
far a child shall act on its own initiative and how far on 
the lines laid down by another ; to determine the respec- 
tive parts of originality and copying. To lump both 
the processes under one term can only obscure the issue. 
The general tendency of man to assimilate his mental 
life to that of his fellows shows itself not only in act 
but in feeling and thought. The gregarious instinct 
prompts human beings to gather together. Each feels 
a satisfaction in being with his fellows, even though they 
are all strangers to him and there is no common purpose. 
Now if there be added anything in the nature of such 
4 purpose—anything which in any way binds the col- 
lected units into a group—there appears this assimilative 
tendency. A crowd hearing an impassioned orator 
becomes swayed by emotion much more violent than 
any one individual in it would have felt had the same 
oration been addressed to him privately. Moved by 
such emotion the crowd will often commit deeds which 
the majority at any rate of its constituents would not 
have done had they not been part of the crowd, but in 
which, it may be, they take an active share. This 
induction of feeling through a group of people is well 
named by M. Ribot ‘emotional unison” In the etymo- 
logical meaning of the word it is ‘sympathy’; that is, 
agreement in feeling. But ordinary usage has restricted 
“sympathy? to a much more advanced and complex 
sentiment, implying in addition to this foundation of 
emotional unison some tenderness towards the individual
-P-A-G-E-178
158 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
with whom we sympathize and some power of intellectual 
representation of his condition. 
The importance of the tendency to unison of feeling 
is obvious when it is borne in mind that emotion prompts 
to action. Many actions really owe their external 
resemblance not to imitation but to such a common 
emotional origin. Let us take a school example. Every 
teacher knows the difference between a class in which 
there is a general spirit of work and one in which the 
prevailing sentiment is towards ‘rotting’. Each boy 
is infected with the general spirit, so that in the one 
case the naturally idle puts forth effort, and in the other 
the naturally industrious relapses into frivolity. It is 
not that individual boys set themselves to imitate their 
fellows in these matters, but that, being in the class 
they have this innate tendency to assimilate themselves 
to its standards. The same thing is true in that wider 
sense in which it is customary to speak of the ‘tone’ 
of a school or class. Here again the fundamental factor 
is the assimilation of the individual to the common life. 
It may be noted in passing that the teacher is subjected 
to this influence as well as the pupils, and if he bea 
weak person or one who is aiming at popularity or at 
cultivating a kind of artificial sympathy his efforts to 
“take the boys’ point of view” as to the value of work 
may lead in time to his adoption of it as his own. 
The more society is divided into groups with little 
contact with each other the more each group tends to 
have a marked class-feeling. Separation of classes means 
that each is ignorant of the ways in which the others 
look at matters common to the whole community. 
Hence is very likely to arise some amount, at any rate, 
of class-suspicion and even of class-antagonism. Here
-P-A-G-E-179
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 159 
again becomes apparent an evil of large towns in which 
the working classes are segregated from the more wealthy 
classes to which the employers of labour belong. In 
the country social ranks are brought much more into 
contact with each other, and from their intercourse 
springs at least some mutual understanding with its 
natural outcome of mutual esteem and respect. When 
many individuals live wholly among their own class their 
outlook and sympathies tend to be narrowed down to 
that class. Both sympathy with other classes and regard 
for the wider interests of the nation as a whole are 
gradually atrophied. 
It may be said, and justly, that in such cases there is 
not only emotional but intellectual assimilation—the 
acceptance of ideas as well as the sharing of the common 
emotional relation to conduct and things, and, conse- 
quently, an assimilation of purpose. Certainly it is so, 
for life isa whole and the distinction between its various 
aspects is only a convenience of discussion. It is, 
indeed, in this general assimilation that we find the 
explanation of much, if not most, of what from the 
outside standpoint would be called imitation. 
It would be strange indeed if a child did not assimilate 
his thoughts to those of the people around him. From 
them he learns his language, and that acquisition is not 
merely of words but of ideas and of ways of thinking. 
A boy who hears his family circle discuss theft as a matter 
of course will regard it in that light unless, or until, 
other surroundings impress the opposed view upon him 
with sufficient strength to oust the original doctrine. 
So, too, the boys in the classes we have supposed will 
assimilate to each other in their estimate of the worth 
of lessons in general and of their class lessons in par-
-P-A-G-E-180
160 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
ticular as well as in their feeling towards them. And 
the two together involve the participated tendency which 
manifests itself in their actions. 
The whole mental attitude may modestly remain in 
the background of consciousness where it always origin- 
ates, but it is not the less effective for that. If the 
tendency be an undesirable one, as in the case of the 
“slack? class, the only effective cure must begin by 
dragging it from its lurking-place. When people realize 
the nature of their behaviour it challenges their approval 
or condemnation. Only when it is condemned will any 
effective change be made. But most boys are decent 
fellows and quite fair-minded enough to acknowledge 
that ‘rotting? is hardly worthy of them. 
In addition to this kind of general absorption of the 
opinions of those around us, there are innumerable cases 
in which ideas are definitely and explicitly suggested to 
us by others, Now the characteristic mark of sugges- 
tion is the omission of proof or reason, as is seen most 
clearly in cases of hypnotism. But we are all liable to 
such suggestion, especially when it comes to us saturated 
with emotion; though the suggestibility of individuals 
varies, as does that of the same individual at different 
times. Generally we may say that everything which 
decreases the dominance of clear purpose, or which 
increases the influence of the background of conscious 
ness relatively to the clear centre of attention, increases 
suggestibility. So, as we might expect, sensitive 
emotional temperaments are the most apt to absorb 
their thoughts from others. In our individual lives 
fatigue increases our liability to accept suggestion. So, 
too, does limitation of knowledge. In a subject 
with which I am familiar I naturally require proof
-P-A-G-E-181
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE — 161 
before accepting a new proposition. But in one in 
which my knowledge is vague I shall be likely to receive 
without demur ideas suggested to me, especially if the 
suggestion comes from a person whom I respect, and 
more especially still if I believe him to be an authority 
on the subject. 
The bearing of this on teaching is not difficult to 
see. Despite the ardent advocates of the view that 
every child should find out every thing for himself the 
practical teacher knows that he must tell his pupils many 
things, not only some which they cannot find out, but 
some of which the proof would be unintelligible to them. 
He acts on their suggestibility. So, indeed, do the 
preachers of the new doctrine act on the suggestibility 
of the general public. With teachers, practical experi- 
tnce forbids the reception of the suggestion; so, of 
tourse, practical teachers are condemned by these 
enthusiasts as fools or knaves or both. 
The effect of suggestion is not a mere shaping of a 
pasive and inert mass of information. Real ideas are 
parts of life—tendencies, direct or indirect, to action. 
Most obviously is this the case when the idea suggested 
is dosely connected with conduct. One suggests to a 
child that something is worth doing or worth learning. 
If the suggestion works he proceeds to do or to learn 
it. Or one suggests that such and such is the best way 
of accomplishing his purpose; if the suggestion is 
adopted he tries that way. A suggestion differs from a 
command in the kind of appeal it makes. The ensuing 
behaviour may be identical in the two cases; the char- 
iter of the act is entirely different. One displaces the 
thild’s initiative ; the other prompts it. Certainly there 
we occasions, especially in early life, when definite 
¥ L
-P-A-G-E-182
162 THE. PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
command alone is adequate to meet the situation, 
Equally certain is it that suggestion should be increas 
ingly the rule, command more and more the exception, 
as the child increases in intelligence, foresight, and 
self-control. Command means control from without; 
suggestion cultivates control from within. 
Some individuals, as we have already seen, receive 
most suggestions negatively. They are the contray 
people whose delight it is to be different from others 
A good many children go through a temporary period 
of contrariness—often about ten or eleven years of age— 
and grow out of it again. It is due, probably, to the 
vague consciousness of increased power which seems to 
mark this period. Others, however, are born so, and 
continue so till the end of the chapter, to the combined 
amusement and annoyance of their friends and acquaint 
ances. This opposition to the suggestions of others s 
not strength of will, as the individual fondly believes 
it to be. Indeed, the more cantankerous he is the mor 
suggestible he is. The only peculiarity about him is his 
mode of reaction. Those who know his foible find # 
quite easy to manage him. ‘They simply urge him nek 
to do what they wish him to do. 
It is evident that suggestibility has a legitimate pat 
to play in every life: it is further obvious that ali 
governed by suggestion would be a pale shadow of i 
surroundings. Self-confidence and  self-initiative * 
needed. Of course, it is arguable that in the mos 
original thoughts of men there is always something ut 
to others. It is a matter of degree. But it is bet 
to restrict ‘suggestion’ to the offering for acceptan® 
definite ideas without proof. This grows out of Y 
general influence of the intellectual life of the comm NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 
upon the individual intellectual life, but should not be 
identified with it. And it is from the general intellectual 
heritage that the original thinker has drawn some of his 
material much more than from definite suggestions of 
others. 
Suggestibility implies the activity of the instinct of 
self-abasement ; self-confidence springs from that of 
self-assertion. The due union of the two gives the 
sane mental life of him who is prepared to listen to all 
sides, but who himself pronounces judgement. 
Itis plain that the origin of many actions which out- - 
vardly appear as imitative has already been found. It 
will add to clearness if we use the term ‘imitation’ very 
strictly. What do we mean when we say we will imitate something ? Surely, this—that we will make a copy of 
t In other words, ftom the standpoint of the doer Imitation is intentional. In so far as our copy departs

Granduca? I should be little pleased were he to show his originality by making alterations. No doubt there Would be differences due to want of skill, but the artist 
Would deliberately set himself to imitate the original, 
and would make those differences as few and as small 
whe could, Let us take another case. Suppose I do 
‘tonjuring trick before an appreciative group of small

howtodoit”. I show them, and they all try to perform 
the tick. They fail at first because their imitation is 
ot close enough, but, when their copying of my actions 
eomes exact they succeed. 
Here we have two typical cases of imitation. In the 163 
aiff} te the product, in the other the process, is copied. The
-P-A-G-E-183
164 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
latter imitation is direct; the former is indirect, for to 
produce the copy a similar use of paints and brushes 
must be made as Raphael himself made. The actu 
‘painting of the master is not available as a model, and 
the requisite skill has to be otherwise acquired. Taking 
the whole process, it is apparent that in the copying of 
a product, as distinct from the imitation of a mode of 
action, there is a considerable element which is sugges 
tion and not imitation at all. The picture to be copied 
suggested the actual process of painting, yet it suggested 
it within most explicitly marked limits and on mot 
definitely laid down lines. The result was determined in 
detail, not simply as a whole. 
In the copying of the conjuring trick, however, 
have imitation pure and simple. Both result and procs 
are to be reproduced as nearly as possible. Any vatit 
tions that may actually occur are involuntary. The

the contrary, the whole wish is to do the trick corre.

has attained power to express himself in his art. Bi

in the powerful suggestive power Raphael exercises o# 
him.

In the second case let us imagine that one of our 
young friends is of an ingenious turn of mind, and that 
on the basis of the trick he learnt by imitation he invents 
another trick. Were again we have suggestion, not 
imitation, and here again the strength or weakness of 
the suggestion will appear in the less or greater divergence 
of the new trick from the old. 
Process necessarily precedes result. Consequently, 
imitation of process is earlier than imitation of result. 
The latter is impossible without skill already acquired, 
the former helps the acquisition of that skill. But even 
imitation of process is impossible unless the kinds of 
movements and co-ordinations of movements in the action 
we already under control. In the acquirement of these 
What is often called ‘unconscious imitation” plays an 
important part. Now, ‘unconscious imitation’ is a 
description in which only the adjective refers to the mind 
of the actor, while the reference of the noun isto the mind 
of the onlooker. This is both confused and confusing. 
When both adjective and noun are referred to the mental 
omigin of the action their combination is a contradiction 
‘a terms. When both are referred to the external 
appearance of the action the adjective is devoid of mean- 
ing, for the suggested distinction between conscious and 
Unconscious imitation does not appear in the character 
of the act looked at from without. If a baby, or an 
adult for the matter of that, unconsciously does an action 
Which another has just done, it is a contradiction in terms 
o speak of him as unconsciously imitating. Wee all 
know how contagious is a cough in church, and, to a less 
degree, a sneeze. Is it not an abuse of language to say 
tat all who cough or sneeze are imitating the first 
sougher or sneezer? Do we not try, on the contrary, to
-P-A-G-E-185
166 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
resist the impulse, though it is often too strong for 
us? 
That a baby does make movements which it sees 
others make is certain. But at first it assuredly has no 
intention to copy, nor even a recognition of the resem- 
blance which is apparent to the onlooker. Until it does 
make the movements as intentional copies there is no 
imitation. As soon as it does so make them, we havea 
proof that its purposive life has begun. To take another 
case of what is often called unconscious imitation. Each 
person learns not only to speak the language of thos 
around him, but to adopt their mode of pronunciation 
Remove a child, say of ten years old, to another distric, 
and after a few months his speech will be a quaint com 
bination of the two dialects, old habit contending with 
new influences and gradually yielding to them. Yet he 
has never set himself to acquire the fresh pronunciation, 
as, for example, a schoolmaster who learnt Latin with the 
traditional English pronunciation may deliberately st 
himself to produce the sounds at present judged ortho 
dox. Similarly, the general modes of behaviour which 
we embrace under the head of ‘manners? result from 
our surroundings, but are not gathered by imitation 
The difference between assimilation and _ imitation 
becomes very apparent to any one who deliberately set 
himself to acquire the conventions of a higher class 
society than that to which he has been accustomed. 
The child’s first movements are in part purely random, 
and in part due to that unconscious assimilation of ont 
self to one’s surroundings which underlies all consciov 
attempts to enter into the feelings, thoughts, and pu 
poses, of those around us. Such unconscious assimil 
tion, as has been pointed out with respect to feeling asd
-P-A-G-E-186
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 167 
thinking, can only be modified by changing the sur- 
roundings or by awakening a definite desire for change— 
such as is aroused when a youth deliberately tries to 
improve his manners. 
The function of real imitation in life is now laid bare. 
It is to help in the acquirement of skill. Combined 
with suggestion it may give an object of pursuit. In 
the former case it works immediately ; in the latter it 
really gives an ideal to which the nearest possible approxi- 
mation is desired. Throughout it is purposive. Long 
ago, indeed, it was classed by Plato under “‘ productive or 
creative art.” Of course, one’s purpose may be to do 
something one has seen another do, and in doing it one 
may copy his mode of action. Then the imitation is 
intentional though the main purpose is not to imitate. 
One imitates as a means to the desired end, but every 
such end carries with it the definite intention to follow 
out the necessary means. For example, a boy moulds 
himself on his favourite batsman. But his real purpose 
'sto become a good batsman himself—if possible better 
than his model. He uses that batsman’s style as a 
foundation for his own, and, the more skilful he becomes 
the more does imitation fade into suggestion in the 
tegulation of his own style by that which inspires it. But 
throughout, the purpose was the development of power 
for himself. 
The place of imitation in education follows. So far 
imitation helps in the acquirement of any form of skill 
it is good; so far as it checks initiative it is bad. In 
any case it is preferable to compelled uniformity of action. 
One of the chief educational objections to the external 
test of imitation is that under one term are massed 
1 Sophist, 219.
-P-A-G-E-187
168 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
together such outwardly determined uniformities and 
the uniformities which spring from the inner desire to do 
what somebody else has done. It is excess of the com- 
pelled uniformities in school which is to be regretted and 
combated. True imitation is the expression of a felt 
need, and will be resorted to no more when the need is 
satisfied. It is always a tool, never an end in itself. 
Children, like adults, differ in the extent to which 
they imitate. That is a matter of temperament, and 
is only one special aspect of the general tendency to be 
more or less formed by surroundings which meets us in 
every department of life. A wise educator tries to 
reduce excess on the one side or the other in this as in 
other forms in which the general assimilative tendency 
. shows itself. The fundamental mistake possible in the 
matter is an assumption that imitation and originality 
are essentially opposed to each other in practical life. 
No doubt they are from the point of view of the 
observer; by no means so from that of the child. In 
each case he has a purpose to fulfil, and that originates 
his action. Whether the result has been achieved before 
is, psychologically, a small point. Most of us never do 
achieve a result that is quite novel. Even with the most 
imitative child the purpose is generally to achieve or to 
become something, and that something is not yet in his 
life. He may imitate in reaching his purpose, but the 
imitation is only a subordinate intention. The whole 
activity is directed to the ideal suggested from without, 
as all our ideals more or less are. Imitation of imita- 
tions, however, can only develop executive skill, and is 
thus ancillary to the free use of imitation in the pursuit of 
purpose. The method of teaching drawing recently 
current in England failed because it ignored this.
-P-A-G-E-188
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 169 
To forbid a child to imitate is to prevent him from 
getting help from others of which he feels the need, 
and which his own being prompts him to seek just in 
that way. The often expressed objection to imitation 
always assumes that in an imitative act the child is 
passive, and that imitation and origination are incom- 
patible. I trust that on each count I have shown that 
the objection springs from the unfortunate custom of 
deciding the nature of imitation by the appearance of 
the act or result, instead of by an analysis of the con- 
sciousness in which the act originates. 
All development of life implies that living is a cumula- 
tive process, 
“That men may rise on stepping stones 
Of their dead selves to higher things.” * 
This, indeed, is of the very essence of growth as com- 
pared with mere succession. Did events in life simply 
succeed each other and leave no trace behind, then ‘‘it is 
evident that even life itself, in its worst and most 
miserable state, could not be supported ; since, though 
oppressed with thirst and hunger, and within reach of 
the most delicious fruits and the most plentiful spring- 
water, we should still suffer, without any knowledge of 
the means by which the suffering could be remedied.” ? 
The point needs no labouring. We all know that 
each of our activities, whether of thought or of action, 
is based on simpler activities of a similar kind. One 
must be able to walk on the ground before one can learn 
to traverse Niagara on a tight-rope ; a mastery of more 
tlementary mathematics is an essential preliminary to a

-P-A-G-E-189
170 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
successful study of the calculus; an affection for those 
nearest to us is the only root from which can grow a far- 
reaching benevolence. 
In every case there is in development an increase both 
in differentiation and in complexity. This is most easily 
seen in the examination of a piece of bodily skill. In 
learning to draw, the child can at first make but few and 
simple strokes. The niceties of form escape both his 
observation and his executive power ; if they be pointed 
out to him he cannot represent them. So with learning 
to play the piano. The movements possible at first are 
simple, slow and awkward in execution, often mistaken. 
Increase of skill in each case is the gradual but continuous 
expression of fresh differences, and the equally constant 
combination of movements into more elaborate wholes. 
Such activities are at once intellectual and physical, and 
the elaboration and growing perfection are in apprehen- 
sion as well as in manual dexterity. Activities in which 
bodily movement is unessential follow the same Jaw of 
progress. A child must learn to use the simple opera- 
tions of arithmetic before he can attack problems which 
involve them. He must know, for example, the product 
of seven and each of the first nine numbers before he can 
multiply a longer number by seven. 
In every case there is involved both habituation result- 
ing from past experience and accommodation to meet the 
demands of the new situation. Behind both, as the very 
origin of the whole, is developing purpose. It is because 
the child wishes to meet the new situation that he calls 
into use the skill he has already acquired and uses his 
intelligence to modify it to suit the present case. The 
keynote of all development is purpose. As soon a8 
purpose fails to expand, life ceases to become richer of
-P-A-G-E-190
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 171 
more effective. Then habituation is dominant; the 
adaptations made are of small importance. They are 
only to conditions of like scope; there has ceased to be 
accommodation to wider and more complex demands. 
Habituation is thus seen to be a good servant but a bad 
master. 
There is no need to enter at length into the origin of 
habits. Everyone knows that they result from repeti- 
tion, and from nothing else. 
Any reaction on impression makes a circuit in the 
nervous system ; every repetition of the same reaction 
strengthens it. The circuit may involve a cortical centre, 
in which case we are conscious of the reaction ; or it may 
pass through a lower centre, when we are at the most 
very dimly aware of the act. This is the case with those 
many habitual mannerisms which mark the behaviour of 
every person, but of which there is little or no conscious- 
ness, unless attention be drawn to them by another. In 
such a case the reaction is as nearly automatic as human 
life ever becomes. It has probably originated without 
deliberate intention, and is one of those reflexions of the 
acts of another which are due to unconscious assimilation. 
Such habits are plainly not of vital importance in life. A 
man may be both a valuable and an able member of 
society, though his every-day manners do not satisfy the 
conventional demands of the most refined circles. They 
are, however, among the most difficult habits to break, 
just because of their petty nature. The circuit is so 
simple that nerves and muscles act mechanically, and it 
requires much patience and watchfulness to rid oneself 
of any of these peculiarities. 
These, if the simplest, are the least important 
examples of human automatism. The habits which
-P-A-G-E-191
172, THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
really matter are those which are organized into acts of 
increasing complexity and form the very substance of 
skill. These either originate in such an instinct as 
curiosity or constructiveness and use imitation of 
another’s’acts as a guide, or begin immediately in an 
impulse to copy what another does. In each case the 
form of the activity is(given by imitation. 
Now, the essential point to notice about these habitua- 
tions is that they are continually undergoing modification. 
Take a child learning to write. {He twists his whole 
body, holds his head in many unsuitable positions, very 
likely protrudes his tongue frowns fiercely, and clutches 
his pen with a desperate grip. The motor reactions are 
many more than are needed, and include some that posi- 
tively hinder the desired action. No doubt, if left to 
himself the child will in time get the circuit pretty clear, 
by gradually discovering and discarding the movements 
which are the most inconvenient. But he will do it all 
the more quickly if in the process he is helped by example 
and direction. Imitation here plays an important part, 
not only in initiating the complex reaction but in guiding 
its improvement. The total activity is from the first a 
synthesis of many movements, each of which can be made 
separately. Indeed, when a child performs one part of 
the process worse than other parts the teacher often picks 
it out, shows the child how to do that act by itself, and 
calls on him to practise it—that is, by repetition to bring 
it up to the level of the other links of the chain. 
When the child can write from a copy the first stage 
of the acquirement is accomplished. He now makes 
only the required movements, and he makes them more 
or less continuously. He has not to attend specially 
either to how he sits or how he holds his pen, or to the
-P-A-G-E-192
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 173 
hand and finger movements required to produce each 
separate stroke and curve, though, probably the teacher’s 
voice will at times remind him that perfection has not 
been reached in one or more of these matters. Let it be 
noted, however, that invariability is confined to details. 
The activity as a whole results in a line of writing, and 
has to be adjusted afresh for each different line. The 
power to produce so variable a whole is a gradual acquire- 
ment, and involves throughout the production of simpler 
elements and their appropriate combination. Analysis 
may easily lead a teacher anxious to simplify to think 
only of the elements and to try to build up writing from 
the foundation of various forms of strokes. No doubt 
the child learns to write when he is set to write, but when 
that time comes there is neither psychological nor 
physiological ground for believing that the preliminary 
exercises had any other effect than to rouse his dislike of 
the process by depriving its earliest stages of meaning. 
The unit of understanding to the child is the word, 
and the earliest writing exercises should deal with 
words, united nearly, if not quite, from the beginning 
into simple sentences. Any preliminary training in 
using a pencil and producing simple forms should be 
incidental in his drawing, not put before him as 
drill preparatory to writing. A fundamental error 
which vitiates much teaching of many subjects lurks in 
this method of beginning with abstract elements. It is 
that purpose is eliminated. The object the teacher has 
in view is that the child may acquire the skilled craft of 
Writing, But that is not a purpose to the child so long 
as it is locked up in the teacher’s breast. Nor, indeed, 
even if it be announced in that general form. For the 
child young enough to be beginning to learn to write
-P-A-G-E-193
174 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
cannot work for a purpose to him an illimitable distance 
ahead. To write immediately the name of his friend 
Tom isa purpose he can feel. To make his first writing 
lesson an attempt to produce this interesting word will 
call forth an energy which will disregard obstacles, come 
up smiling after failure, and persevere till the desired 
result is produced. ‘Till teaching shakes itself free from 
the educationally deadly theory that life is directed from 
without it will always lose the greater part of its possible 
effectiveness, just because of this same want of faith in 
the child’s fund of energy ready to rush forward to any 
end which seems to him worth attaining. 
The later stages of the process of learning to write 
develop in the same way. More and more of the execu- 
tive part of the activity becomes automatic; more and 
more the adaptation to new requirements is freely at 
the disposal of the intelligence. The second step is 
obviously writing from memory a phrase containing 
only words which have often been written by imitation. 
Here the form of each word—which we call spelling 
—has to be produced without a copy. It is evident 
that much repetition is a necessary preliminary to that. 
Nor need that repetition have been only with the pen. 
Many minds form habits of utterance, and to such the 
oral spelling of a word letter by letter, whether aloud or 
silently, is a considerable help in forming the habit of 
writing it correctly. Children, like adults, differ in the 
way in which they naturally learn such things, and the 
wise teacher will allow each to follow his bent. Many, 
perhaps most, say the separate letters as they write them. 
That is, they name them. Why not encourage them to 
say the letters as they look at them after they have written 
them if they find it helps them? If the purpose to learn
-P-A-G-E-194
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 175 
to spell the words has been roused in the child’s mind 
he may safely be left to do it in his own way. Doubtless 
the old scholastic tradition of hearing a child say lessons 
he had learnt had its disadvantages, but it did, at any 
rate, leave each free to learn them as he would, and it 
certainly gave him a reason for learning them, though 
not of the best kind. The newer methods tend to take 
this freedom from the children, to make the learning of 
all an imitation of the same method, and thus to keep 
the intelligence in Jleading-strings. By deadening 
initiative such a course deadens effort. So the learners 
have to be stimulated by an external appeal no better, if 
more agreeable, than the old one, for pleasure and pain 
stand on the same moral level. In short, many modern 
methods of teaching, in attempting to make learning 
easy to the child, give so minute a guidance of action 
that they eliminate all virility from the learning by 
banishing purpose, effort, and originality. But without 
the cultivation of these the habit of expecting by one’s 
own efforts to reach better things than those of the 
present cannot be formed. 
The third and last stage in the acquirement of the art 
of writing rests on automatism of formation both of 
letter and of word. The purpose is now to express ideas. 
This leads into all the possible developments of com- 
Position, Into this it is not necessary to enter at length. 
The process is the same throughout—each step secured 
is only the starting-point for a further advance. The 
bald, awkward sentences of the beginner advance little 
by little to the grace and force of style of which each is 
capable. Here, again, the neglect of the appeal to pur- 
Pose is too frequently seen in the very early stage of 
development at which the advance of many a school
-P-A-G-E-195

boy or girl stops. They have no desire to write well: 
they only produce their ‘composition’ because the 
teacher tells them to do so. But to them a composition 
is a composition, and one is as good as another so far as 
form goes. Only in the subject-matter, and that not 
always by any means, is their interest aroused. Again, 
I think, the teaching is vitiated by an inadequate psycho- 
logy ; by a want of recognition of the relative parts of 
purpose and habit in human life. 
Such an analysis as we have here made of writing 
would apply to all forms of executive habituation. In 
some the combination in definite series is more important 
than in others. The multiplication table, for example, 
is not a series operatively. Consequently, it should not 
be established as a habitual series by the writing or 
repetition of ‘tables’, That results in a child being 
unable to give the product of seven and nine without 
saying the whole of the seven times table, if not all those 
which precede it in the books from “‘ twice one is two”. 
Similarly, 2 boy who has learnt the paradigms of the 
Latin declensions as a preliminary to the use of any 
Latin words will begin with the nominative singular 
and say through the whole list of cases till he comes to 
the one he needs, it may be the ablative plural. In other 
cases, as in learning poetry, the correct series is all im- 
portant. The mode of actual future use should always 
determine the mode of learning by heart—that is, of 
forming a habit of doing and saying. 
The value of the development of such automatism as 
we have described is apparent. The adaptation it makes 
possible means that intelligence can get to grips with the 
new, and leave habit to deal with the old. As the newis 
conquered it also becomes old, and is transferred to the
-P-A-G-E-196
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 177 
province of the executive. Of course, the new and the 
old are not separate, standing side by side. They are 
combined in all sorts of ways in reality. Consequently, 
our activity which deals with them is one activity, not 
two. It is impossible to cut off the automatic from the 
originative. The two interpenetrate each other, as will 
be plain to any one who has mastered: such an example 
asthat of writing. We may say, indeed, that the whole 
ativity uses its automatism intelligently. It follows 
that individual habits are not developed by any one of us 
beyond the stage at which that kind of automatism is 
useful in our lives. So that if ever habit comes to play a 
part at all analogous to that of instinct in the lives of the 
lower animals there is arrested mental development, for 
Progress is then no longer held to be desirable. 
This leads us to consider those wide trends of mental 
life which are directive rather than executive, yet are 
lubitual in their constant recurrence. To distinguish 
these from the habits of executive dexterity already 
considered it is well to name them ‘habitudes.’ 
Most of the habitudes of the majority of folk, and 
many of those of all, originate in the cumulative in- 
fluence upon the individual of his surroundings. The 
general modes of belief, of aspiration, of attitude 
towards others, of estimates of worth, are really habits 
of the community, passed on from generation to genera- 
ton, and forming the social tradition. We have seen 
how we draw these in with our earliest breath. They 
we expressed constantly both in the actions and in the 
Speech of those about us. We learn that speech, we 
imitate those actions. That is, we talk of the things of 
life as we understand them from the point of view 
Current in our social circle, we feel and act towards others 
Ww M
-P-A-G-E-197
i178 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
as we see iscustomary. The influence of such habitudes 
in enabling us to enter into the life of the community, 
and to draw spiritual sustenance from it, needs only to 
be mentioned to be obvious. But it carries with ita 
danger. As life goes on these habitudes grow stronger, 
As intelligence develops they may become narrower, 
unless an impulse of feeling lead us to see that our duties 
and relations are not cabined and confined within the 
strait limits of our immediate circle. Such narrow but 
intense habitudes, accepted without individual thought 
from without and operative only in the realm of the 
familiar, into the mould of which they persist in forcing 
everything new and strange, we know as prejudices. 
Each of us is convinced that at the most one person in 
the world is free from prejudice, andjno two agree}as to 
who that person is. - 
It is evidently here that the vital danger of habit 
comes in. The mere arrest of the development of 
executive habituation may make a man less efficient in 
some walk of active life than he might have become, but 
that may be compensated by greater mental productive- 
ness. The excess of mental habituation means the much 
more serious stifling of mental initiative, of originality. 
Such a mind uses executive automatism always in the 
same round of activities. A nation obsessed by mental 
habituation would be stationary in civilization, becaus 
the sterility of the national mind of necessity carries with 
it stagnation both of the applied arts and of all forms of 
spiritual culture. 
How shall mental stagnation be avoided? A habi- 
tude is a trend of life determined by the past. But life | 
is also determined by anticipation of the future, for “ the 
future has generally much more to do with our present 
wf «
-P-A-G-E-198
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 179 
moods than the past.”? So again the answer is—by 
development of purpose. Our purposes, as incentives 
to effort, are affiliated to the propulsive force of our 
instincts. And that propulsion is essentially emotional. 
The instinct is stimulated by something in the situation 
and tends to deal with it in a particular manner. Full- 
grown purpose is a development of this complex process. 
With growth of experience the crude primary emotions 
become combined in various ways, and produce states of 
greater complexity according to our relations to different 
elements in our surroundings. They, therefore, demand 
more complex activities to satisfy them. At the same 
time, growing intelligence is gradually making clear the 
relation of things to ourselves and to each other. Thus, 
“instinct supplies an outline sketch of behaviour, to 
which experience adds colour and shading.”? This 
colour and shading give rise to purpose—the resolution 
toattempt to attain that which seems to be of worth. 
We have seen that imitation originates activities which 
by repetition become at once habitual and adaptive. 
Throughout we have urged the presence of purpose. 
But the purposes which direct any one class of habits are 
all of the same general kind. They are feelings of the 
worth of one type of experiences sufficiently powerful 
to induce effort to realize them. Thus, such a series of 
purposes is a habitude. It is a trend of mental life 
gtowing little by little as the purposes widen, but marked 
at every stage by a characteristic form of expression— 
the habit of action with which in origin it was connected, 
by which it grows, and to which it adds growth. For, 
like every other form of life, a habitude grows by acting, 
VW. J. Locke: Ar the Gate of Samaria, ch. 24.

-P-A-G-E-199
180 THE. PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
and its activity exercises and develops the corresponding 
habit. So we see the force of Plato’s enquiry: “Did 
you never observe how imitations, beginning in early 
youth and continuing far into life, at length grow into 
habits and become a second nature, affecting body, voice, 
and mind? ”? 
There are, then, two main classes of habitudes, or life- 
tendencies, in each one of us. The one makes for 
sterility and increasing narrowness : it is a force of mental 
inertia. The other leads to fertility, increased breadth 
of outlook and of sympathy, a wider range of activities: 
it is essentially dynamic, urging us on to better things. 
These latter habitudes do not tend to keep things as they 
are, but they are habitual trends of mind nevertheless. 
Habitudes may pass from the one class to the other. 
A purpose which has been pursued long enough to form 
ahabitude may be dropped. The habitude still remains, 
but it acts more and more blindly. On the other hand, 
when intelligence tests and tries, by its effects on life, a 
habitude which has grown up from intercourse with 
others and without definite intention, it may adopt it as 
general line in which purpose shall work. Then the 
habitude loses its inert character because it is infused 
with the dynamic power of purpose. It is not the 
origin, but the present condition, of a habitude which 
decides its present effect on life ; though it is plain that 
habitudes which grew up in us unnoticed, and which owe 
both origin and support to the customs amid which we 
live, are less likely to be followed with full intention 
than those which prew round purpose from the begin- 
ning. Yet so many of the most important things of 
life—our religion, our morality, our opinions on all socal 
1 Rep., Jowett’s trans., Bk. iii, p. 395.
-P-A-G-E-200
NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 181 
and political questions—do originate in this involuntary 
way, that when life advances to the stage in which we are 
not occupied solely with the individual things of the very 
neat present, but are able to take an increasingly wide 
outlook on life and see at least some of its meaning, it 
is surely necessary that each one of us should try to 
justify to himself his beliefs on these most essential 
matters, and if they cannot be approved, to modify or to 
reject them as may seem necessary. The result will be 
at once a principle of conduct and a sphere in which new 
or modified habitudes may grow. 
The formation of ‘ general habits’, such as tidiness, 
accuracy, punctuality, and the like, depends on the rela- 
tion between habitude and habit as found in purpose. If 
aparent or a teacher try to form such habits from with- 
out, success will naturally be limited to the particular 
Matter in which they are formed. The whole process is 
made a mechanical reaction to certain circumstances, and 
the teaction will be called forth only by just that kind of 
fircumstances. If, on the other hand, a purpose be 
inspired, and by needful reminders kept clearly in view, 
then a habitude grows up which finds expression in the 
desired acts. But such a purpose, like all purposes, 
* implies not only an emotional spring of individual action 
~such as desire to please parent, or fear of punish- 
ment—but an intellectual grasp of the value of the 
tequired habit. Certainly children differ in these / 
matters, as in others. Especially the differences between’ 
the active and the emotional temperaments are likely to 
give variation both in the rapidity and in the perfection 
with which the habit is formed. So, when no general 
abit is formed it may be suspected that the training has 
been directed immediately to the outward act, and has
-P-A-G-E-201
182 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
failed to attach adequate importance to the determination 
of conduct by purpose. It is habitude that is wanted; 
then habit can be left to take care of itself. To 
regard habit as merely regulative of action is to fall 
into a similar. mistake as to assume acts to be imitative 
simply because they look to us like other acts. Outward 
habit may be either a mechanical reaction or the deliberate 
use of executive automatism. 
The question of changing any form of habituation is 
one of much practical importance ; for there is no human 
being but has both habitudes and habits which it would 
be well to modify or to replace. It must be noted that 
there can be no such thing as simply dreaking a habit 
All habituation is a determination of the direction of 
some part of life. We cannot cut out a piece of life; 
we can only change its form. In every case, great and 
small, the first essential is to evoke—in ourselves or in 
others as the case may be—the purpose to adopt the 
opposed mode of thinking, feeling, or acting. This is 
least difficult in processes that have always demanded 
thought for their execution, that is, in those already 
determined by conscious purpose. For then we have 
only to substitute purpose for purpose. But when the 
habituation has become automatic in its whole operation, 
as in tricks of manner and in prejudices, a conscious 
purpose has to be introduced into a process from which 
itisabsent. In the one class of activities we have always 
used the habituations for our own clearly conceived ends, 
and to these they have been essentially subordinate. In 
the other class the habituations have, each in its owl 
sphere, obtained the mastery of life, and we have to 
awaken and originate purpose, not merely to change it 
Purpose having been evoked, the new habituation cat

q NATURE OF EXPERIENCE 183) 
only grow in the ordinary way—by practice. Thesooner 
occasion is sought for such exercise the better ; for unful- 
filled purpose grows cold and weak. Every repetition 
of acts which tend towards the new habituation, it must 
beremembered, gives to the new purpose all the cumula- 
tive force of the growing habitude. So, too, any hark- 
ing back to the old mode of behaviour must be avoided, 
or the old habituation is revived in all its force, and the 
work has to be begun over again. 
Experience, then, is not simply the course of life; it 
is the organization of life. Throughout we have as the 
two essential elements, purpose and habituation, but not 
unrelated to each other. Purposes, beginning in per- 
sistent imitation, are at first smalland isolated. Habitua- 
tion is at the same time weak and vague. As intelli- 
gence and interest in the surroundings grow, purposes 
draw together, become more related to each other and 
extend more remotely from the present. At the same 
time their realization requires increased. executive 
habituation, But the persistent following of lines of 
purpose is creating habitudes, our relations with our sur- 
toundings are developing others. Here is possibility of 
mental arrest, due to a petrification of mere custom and 
a consequent narrowing of initiation. This, however, 
18 not necessary. We can, by concentration of purpose, 
change or modify a habituation which, for any reason, is 
Tepugnant to us. Such modification still keeps the 
habituation in relation to the life around, but it may, to 
a greater or less extent, modify even the general social 
habit, At any rate, it will so modify it for any one who 
is brought within the sphere of our personal influence. 
So we are responsible not only for our own lives but for 
the kind of impulses we give to the lives of others.

The life process, as we have sketched it, is never com- 
pleted. Whenever development ceases there is mental 
arrest. To some it comes in early childhood, to others 
with the senility of advanced old age. In each case there 
is organic defect beyond the power of the will. But 
in normal life the matter is within our own control, 
There is much both of stimulus and of encouragement in 
the words of George Eliot: ‘Our lives make a moral

be noble.”?

CHAPTER VII 
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 
“Bory pains and pleasures are the unknown principles 
of all human actions.”! In these words did Helvetius, 
with his usual clearness and consistency, state the out- 
come of the theory that human life is built up of the 
sensations received from the surroundings. Both the 
ultimate hypothesis and this practical deduction from it 
still influence education. Formerly the rule of conduct 
was applied in the assumption that only by bodily pain, - 
or the threat of it, could a boy be induced to learn his 
lessons. In these humanitarian days the appeal to 
pleasure is more fashionable. School is to be essentially 
a place of enjoyment; the dull and the difficult are to 
be banished, and a pleasant excitement is to mark every 
lesson. School work is to be made ‘interesting’, then 
children will ‘like? it. 
Old fashioned people recoil from all this. They urge 
tht to make everything enjoyable, and to call for the 
doing of no disagreeable tasks, is but a sorry preparation 
for that later life in which everyone often has to do things 
he detests doing. As is usual with those who recoil 
fom a new doctrine, they often go, at any rate in theory, 
to the other extreme, and practically assert that the dis- 
De Phomme, de ses facultés, et de son éducation, sect. ii, ch. 6,
-P-A-G-E-205
486 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
tastefulness of lessons is an excellent measure of their 
educational value. 
It may be urged that each view rests on two mistakes: 
one common to both; the others complementary. That 
common to both is that children’s activity is only deter- 
mined from without: the one theory relies on allure- 
ment, the other on compulsion. The complementary 
errors are that the one fixes its view exclusively on the 
present life of the child, the other only on its life in the 
years of maturity.. The discussion in the last chapter 
leads to the rejection of all these assumptions. Of the 
first because it fails to find the real spring of activity in 
the child itself; of the last two because they do not 
recognize that experience is a continuous development. 
If one ask another—‘‘ Why do you study psycho- 
logy?” the answer will probably refer to some form of 
interest, it may be in mental life itself, it may be in an 
examination in which questions are set on mental life. 
Evidently we can call the one interest direct or immediate, 
the other indirect or mediate. ‘The connexion of the 
latter with our real purpose is an artificial one. In each 
case, however, interest is given as the explanation of why 
the activity takes that direction rather than another. 
Further, if the interest be indirect, it will not lead to 
the study of psychology when once the examination is 
passed; if it be direct it may influence reading and 
thought for many years. A teacher who is interested in 
his pupils as children to be trained, and not simply as 
phonographs to be furnished with records, will always 
find interest in everything that throws light on their lives. 
We know, however, that the students of psychology 
are far outnumbered by people who take no interest in 
that subject, and who would find such a book as this
-P-A-G-E-206
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 187 
extremely boring. This is a fair example, and it brings 
out that “what is one man’s meat is another man’s 
poison” in intellectual as well as in physical matters. In 
what interests me most I may, indeed, be quite alone. 
It is my own most intimate personal concern. Each one 
of us has such private interests, and they are his dearest 
possessions. 
It is evident then, that neither interest nor its opposite, 
tedium, is a quality of the external object. Often, 
indeed, we speak of a book as interesting or of a lecture 
as tedious. But in doing so we are only transferring 
our own feeling to the object. Another person may, 
with equal justification, reverse our adjectives. Even 
if every reader of a book agreed that it was wearisome, 
there would still be one person who esteemed it interest- 
ing—the author. With real qualities of things it is 
diferent. Everyone with normal senses asserts a 
shilling to be white, circular, and flat. But the judge- 
ment of interest is not thus dependent merely on the 
presence of what may be called the appropriate intel- 
lectual organ. It is true that to find a book interesting 
We must have sufficient knowledge to understand it ; but 
itis not true that we find interesting everything we have 
sufficient knowledge to understand. If we lose our 
interest in a subject—and we all have had experience of 
doing that—we do not then and there lose the knowledge 
we have of it. I may know now all I ever knew about 
kite-flying, and yet no longer desire to fly a kite: my 
interest in that pursuit is dead. 
Tt follows that the idea that lessons can be in them- 
selves interesting or wearisome rests on an inadequate 
analysis. Of course, a heavy manner, a dull mode of 
speaking, a muffled enunciation, are favourable to the
-P-A-G-E-207
188 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
development of tedium, as their opposites promote alert- 
ness. They act on the dim background of consciousness, 
and help or hinder in inverse proportion to the strength 
of the interest. If that be strong these are ignored. 
But if a teacher trust to a bright manner and amusing 
illustrations he is likely to find that the substance of the 
lesson has led to no thought, that is, has aroused no 
intellectual interest. Certainly a teacher may be able to 
choose lessons that are likely to rouse interest in all the 
members of his class. That comes from knowledge of 
them. So that when this is the case it is not the lesson 
that is made interesting but the class that is interested. 
And when children say they have had an interesting 
lesson they of course mean that it interested sem. 
If interest is not a quality of the object, neither is it 
an attribute of our own minds. It can only be found 
in a relation between the two. Everything which in 
any way comes into our consciousness is part of our 
environment, but we are not interested in it all. The 
test of interest is that we dwell on the object ; and we 
neither do nor could dwell on everything. Is, then, this 
relation to be found in the pleasure or pain the objects 
give us? Are we interested only in what immediately 
pleases? If so, the teacher who tries to arouse interest 
through pleasure is right. 
Let us look at the case of a boy trying to make a toy 
ait-ship. Every step in the construction is of interest 
to him because it leads to the fulfilment of his desire, 
the accomplishment of his.purpose. He nails and pastes, 
not because nailing and pasting are in themselves delight- 
ful, but because without nailing and pasting the air-ship 
cannot be made. Does he desist because he bruises his 
fingers with the hammer or cuts them with knife or saw?
-P-A-G-E-208
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 189 
Does a first failure daunt him, or does he start again to 
repair his mistake? Does he, in fact, bother his head 
about the quality of the sensations he is experiencing? 
Or take a boy who is interested in the collection of certain 
water-plants. Does he object to getting wet and muddy? 
Yet these are in themselves unpleasant ; he enjoys them, 
not because of what they are when estimated alone, but 
because they are parts of a whole experience which he 
does not split up in his mind any more than in his 
actions. Do scratched fingers stop the gathering of 
blackberries? Yet not the most hardy boy would say 
that he really likes scratches, or would spend his time in 
deliberately and in cold blood inflicting scratches on 
himself. 
¢ Examples could be multiplied indefinitely. But we 
need not elaborate the matter. We all know that in the 
pursuits each chooses for himself it is the purpose which 
not only directs but supplies the energy. It may be in 
the background of consciousness, but it governs the line 
of conduct, and the sense that it is being gradually 
attained spurs on to further and continued efforts, which 
give joy in proportion as they are successful with refer- 
ence to just that end. Whether this or that portion of 
what has to be done is in itself pleasant or unpleasant 
matters not at all. It is not considered by itself because 
it does not exist for us except as part of the whole pro- 
cess, It is in that, as an expression of the self doing what 
it desires to do, that we delight. Remove the hard parts, 
indeed, and you often take away most of the zest, as 
when a boy is interested in climbing a cliff to gather sea- 
gull’ eggs. One of the real joys of his life is to conquer 
difficulties, and the more he has to strive the more he re~ 
Joices in conquest. No one who knows children could so
-P-A-G-E-209
190 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
libel them as to maintain that they are wholly, or even 
mainly, determined in their actions by the physical pain or 
pleasure those actions bring. Indeed, it takes many years 
of consistent practice to produce a well-developed egoist. 
I suppose everyone would say that a child is interested 
in such pursuits as have been mentioned. It follows 
that this interest has no necessary connexion with 
pleasure. Its relation is to purpose, and when that is 
strong the child is interested in all that relates to it and 
helps to its attainment. | The test of his interest is his 
readiness to put forth effort.'. If this be the case the 
evoking of interest, so far ftom being antagonistic to 
the development of the power to do the distasteful is 
actually the only way in which that power can be 
developed in the child’s own soul. Mere outward com- 
pulsion to do the unpleasant does not arouse any purpose, 
unless it be the purpose to avoid it as much as possible. 
To awaken interest in something which can only be 
attained by doing the unpleasant is the only way to 
inspire subordination of pleasure and pain to the higher 
needs of life. And the subordination is more easily 
made because the sense of conquest over difficulties is 
itself a higher pleasure than any derived from the senses. 
“Work while work pleases you. Love it for its own 
sake. Set a great end before you; but the attaining 
it is the delight, not the ultimate attainment. If you 
think of nothing but the end, the reaching of it is all 
feverish unrest and toil.?? 
This conception of the absence of necessary connexion 
between interest and pleasure is borne out by the uses 
of the word in ordinary life. To take a few examples— 
. “Tt is to his interest to keep on good terms with his

employer, though he hate him.” “‘ Pitt had the interests 
of his country at heart.” ‘‘ The monied interest is at 
times opposed to the landed interest.” ‘‘ Compared 
with discipline, details of curriculum are matters of 
subordinate interest.”  ‘‘ He is much interested in social 
reform.” ‘To love one’s native country...to be 
interessed in its concerns is natural to all men.”? “I 
should be glad... to see you take a little more interest in 
duties which you may be called upon to discharge.” * 
“The mother awaited with breathless interest the 
doctor’s report on her sick child.” 
The shades of meaning are very various, but through 
them all runs the original force of the Latin word— 
that which concerns us or is of importance to us in some 
way. But the idea of pleasure is either absent altogether, 
or present only incidentally and in a subordinate degree. 
This is bound to be so, for the ways in which things and 
events concern us are by no means always pleasant. If 
Tmet a tiger prowling along a country lane I should be 
Interested in his movements, but the interest would not 
be that of calm enjoyment. No doubt a spy about to 
be shot is interested in the proceedings of the soldiers 
who are preparing to carry out the sentence. A man 
who suspects that he is suffering from ptomaine poison- 
ing is interested in his symptoms and in the doctor’s 
teport on them. In neither case would any but a lunatic 
assume pleasure as the basis of the interest. 
We really come to this—that things and events may 
concern us in every aspect of our possible relations to 
them ; and so may be of any and every emotional value 
tous. So it may be said that we are interested in what- 
ever raises in us any emotion. Of course, the emotion.

is not the interest. Iam interested in a case of mis- 
fortune which rouses my sympathetic pity, or in a lawsuit 
in which my anger at another’s conduct towards me is 
finding expression. But, the emotional value the object 
has for me leads me to ‘think about it and to act in 
relation to it. Similarly a boy is interested in the temper 
of a teacher whom he fears, and his interest may lead 
him to learn a distasteful lesson. 
In all such cases it is plain that there is an intellectual 
element in the interest. If the emotion be so strong as 
to carry us away—as in a violent burst of angry passion, 
or of despairing grief—the whole consciousness of the 
relation is absorbed into the emotion. Then the value 
of the experience is not recognized, for there is no room 
for judgement. A man, for example, often declares quite 
honestly that he is not angry, when it is obvious to the 
onlooker that he is in a bitter rage ; and deep grief may 
for the time blot out all surroundings. Then thought 
is in abeyance, or rather is overshadowed by emotion. 
- All emotion prompts to action of some definite kind. 
Thus it follows that when we are interested we act, and 
that the kind of action depends not on the mere fact of 
interest but on the kind of emotional value the thing 
in which we are interested has for us. Vague objectless 
activity implies indifference, which is the absence of any 
one interest. To be interested, therefore, means to be 
urged from within to some course of action with reference 
to the object which interests us. If the interest be one 
of fear, as when one meets a tiger, the activity is flight; 
if that be out of the question, as with the boy and his 
stern teacher, the activity is preventive ; if it be one of 
pity, the activity is benevolent ; if it be one of curiosity, 
the activity is enquiry. In every case, the conduct is

determined by the emotion in relation to the circum- 
stances in which the act must take place. 
The prompting of emotion takes shape in desire. To 
desire is to want—to recognize a need and to imagine 
ameans of satisfying it. Desire grows out of instinct 
and appetite, and is at first quite indefinite in its outlook. 
The baby feels the need and seeks about for the means 
of satisfaction with no guidance except the experience 
of fast satisfactions. It is only, then, as experience 
becomes definite, and understanding of the relations of 
our surroundings to ourselves is attained, that desires 
become clear as to their objects. Now, desire is neces- 
urily an intensely personal feeling ; consequently, the 
tatural outcome is for us to identify ourselves with it 
by resolving to act upon it. Sometimes we do not act 
because several desires, incompatible with each other,

people have so many incompatible desires of 
Practically equal strength—or weakness—that they

deliberation. or vacillation till one decides to follow one 
desire and to reject the other. The attainment of the 
object of the desire chosen is now made a purpose, that 
is, it becomes the aim of endeavour. 
It is seen, then, that purpose, desire, and interest are 
connected. We desire only what we esteem good, and 
we take as purpose only what we desire. When the 
purpose is formed, everything connected with it i 
interesting to us, just because only through knowing it 
can our purpose be amply gained and our desire sufii- 
ently satisfied. Let us examine an example. I desire 
to go to live in Italy. It may be because I believe the 
climate will be more agreeable to me than that of 
England, or because the artistic and historical associations 
of Italy attract me. For a long time the desire may 
be ineffective, for circumstances may make it impossible 
to give effect. to it. Yet it is a real desire if its 
accomplishment only await the removal of those ex- 
traneous hindrances. If really there be no intention to 
go when occasion does offer there is no true desire but 
only a kind of day-dream, intended to find such satis 
faction in itself as one may find in living through 4 
romance. All the time the purpose is in abeyancé 
everything which concerns Italy is of the greatest 
interest to me. I shall read eagerly books which 
deal with the country, its people, its art treasures, 
its archeology ; indeed, all that belongs to it. All this 
has a personal tone quite different from what the same 
matters would have if I were not proposing to go to 
live in the country. In that case the whole interest 
would be intellectual and impersonal, and the purpox 
simply to increase knowledge ; in this it is practical and 
personal as well, and the purpose affects my whole life.

Evidently, too, in the latter case many things will be 
of interest to me to which in the former case I should 
be quite indifferent. 
The consideration of an instance of this kind brings 
out the relation of interest to habitude. When a purpose 
affects a wide stretch of our lives, and especially when 
its fulfilment is possible only in the future, our thoughts 
; often dwell upon it. This develops a habitude of think- 
ing on that subject. When the purpose, though it can 
only be accomplished in the future, is yet being gradually 
fulfilled in the present, as in writing a book, evidently 
the habitude is more quickly formed and more frequently 
dominant when it is formed. Everything then is looked 
at ftom the point of view of the work in hand, and 
interest often finds relations between it and pieces of 
Posience that at first sight would seem far removed 
m it. 
In our first example we saw that the connexion of 
‘nterest with purpose may be direct or indirect. It is 
the former when the means in which interest is taken 
we of the same nature as the purpose, so that the fulfil- 
ment of the purpose is the natural outcome of the means. 
lf one’s purpose is to understand children the natural 
means to adopt is to study them, and anything which 
helpful in such study is directly interesting. If one 
8 going to live in Italy all that bears on Italian life is 
directly connected with the purpose. If a boy desires 
fo make a successful air-ship the parts of physics that 
bdp him are directly interesting to him. 
On the other hand, if one reads a book on physics in 
order to pass an examination the interest is indirect. 
The examination might with equal facility have induced 
astudy of geology or of old English literature. There
-P-A-G-E-215
196 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
is no desire to learn the subject because it will throw 
light on a part of experience. The real purpose is 
to pass the examination, and the student will do the 
least which he believes sufficient. Of course, it often 
happens that a subject taken up for such an extraneous 
motive shows itself of value. Then interest in it 
awakens ; the direct purpose is born, and exists side by 
side with the indirect till the examination. Afterwards, 
if it be of any strength, and worth calling a purpose at 
all, it still guides reading and thought. 
Now it is certain that in life we have to do a good 
many things in which our interest is only of this indirect 
kind. When a man works to earn a living the purpose 
of securing remuneration for his work is artificially con- 
nected with the work itself. The art of the shoemaker 
aims at producing shoes, that of the doctor at curing of 
preventing sickness, that of the schoolmaster at develop- 
ing worthy citizens. When this direct purpose is 
present, well and good: there is direct interest in the 
work as well as indirect interest in it as a means to 
securing an income. But if the latter only be present 
there is no joy in the work itself, and it is degraded to 
mere drudgery. 
Even when the immediate interest in the work is 
strong there are sure to be many portions of the day’s 
task which are not naturally connected with it, and yet 
which have to be done. The doctor has to listen with 
sympathy to the querulous complaints of a wealthy 
patient who imagines himself ill; the schoolmaster has 
to go through routine duties which have no bearing 00 | 
the education of his pupils. In all such cases we att 
much helped by the general habitude of doing whit 
comes in the day’s work without too much enquiry #
-P-A-G-E-216
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 197 
to how we like it. Naturally these extraneous tasks do 
not furnish occupation for our leisure time: if, for 
instance, a schoolmaster marks exercises out of school- 
hours he will doubtless agree that the hours devoted to 
that work, whatever they may be in scholastic theory, 
are not in fact leisure hours. 
Now, suppose we apply these considerations to the 
young. Evidently the habitude of taking calmly all that 
comes in the day’s work is not so strong with them as 
with us. Yet it should be forming, and school should 
help to form it. It is clear that if a direct interest can 
be aroused in a subject the teacher need not be careful 
to remove difficulties, though he must see that they are 
proportioned to the strength which is to deal with them. 
Nor need he try to add adventitious attraction to the 
dull places: an increase of vividness in the purpose is 
much more effective. Further, direct interest should be 
aimed at in all school work. ‘‘For getting a fine 
flourishing growth of stupidity there is nothing like 
Pouring out on a mind a good amount of subjects in 
which it feels no interest?! But any subject may fail 
to arouse direct interest in some of the pupils, and some 
subjects, which yet for good reasons should be studied, 
May not rouse such interest in any. The children must 
not therefore be allowed to neglect them. In these cases 
appeal must be made to the indirect interest of fulfilling 
such purposes as doing one’s best, pleasing one’s parents 
or teacher, winning distinction, not hindering one’s class, 
and even avoiding punishment. The more real and 
Positive such indirect purposes are the better. So, 
merely to avoid punishment is much the least desirable 
of them all. Even when direct interest exists some of 
\George Eliot : The Mill on the Floss, Book v, ch. 2, .
-P-A-G-E-217
198 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
these indirect interests are a great help, and the younger 
the child the more he needs them. Can any one of us 
dispense with them altogether? 
To be interested is to feel that some object or class 
of objects has a value for us, and on that account to be 
prompted to act in accordance with that feeling. Interest 
does not create activity but direct it ; it decides which 
parts of our surroundings shall occupy our lives, and 
which parts shall be relegated to obscurity. Conse- 
quently, in seeking the chief types of interests we must 
not only examine the form of activity to which each 
prompts but the kind of objects with which each deals. 
‘The former consideration is primary, for in it we find the 
value of the interest to our own lives ; but the latter isalso 
important, as it controls the actual filling of those lives. 
The broadest division of our environment is into men 
and things, and that will be sufficient for our purpose. 
Our relations with both men and things are always such 
that we know something of the object, it has a certain 
value for us, and, in consequence, we act—or refrain 
from acting—in reference to it. One or other of these 
aspects may be prominent in any one action ; and one 
or other of them may dominate any one life. Hence 
we get the distinction of practical, intellectual, and 
emotional temperaments. Hence also we may divide 
interests into practical, intellectual, and emotional. A 
life in which one or other of them predominates shows 
by that fact that it belongs to the corresponding temper 
ment. Indeed, there is no other way of determining 
temperament than by reference to prevalent interests. 
Because of the inborn temperament the interests are felt; 
because the interests lead to certain types of acts we 
know the temperament. ’

DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 199 
A practical interest asks—What is the use of it? an 
intellectual interest What does it mean? an emotional 
interest —What is its worth in itself? So, with relation 
to things, the first leads to all forms of invention and 
useful contrivances ; the second to the increase of know- 
ledge; the third to the development of all forms of 
att. In relation to people the practical interest is con- 
cerned with their relations to oneself; the theoretical 
or intellectual interest with their relations among them- 
selves as seen in laws, institutions, customs; the 
emotional interest with the intrinsic nature of their moral 
and social state. The religious interest includes all the 
others. In its highest form its centre is emotional and 
shows itself in love and awe, while the intellectual interest 
of understanding the divine mysteries, and the practical 
interest of one’s own individual salvation or damnation 
are subordinate. ee ay 
In the practical interest knowledge is not sought for ! 
its own sake, but for the use which can be made of it. 
It is not at all that knowledge is despised:’On the 
contrary it is highly valued—but always'as a méahs to 
something else. Without increase of knowledge practi¢ 
tal interests are confined to the repetition of the past. 
So, till some two centuries ago men had made little 
advance in two thousand years in the adaptation: of 
material things to their needs. While the search for 
knowledge was confined to the world of thoughts and 
beliefs its results were of no avail for dealing with the 
things of sense. With the growth of knowledge of the 
physical constitution of things the practical mind has 
been able to invent means of utilizing. natural forces. 
These could only be used when they were known, and 
every machine is simply a contrivance for combining
-P-A-G-E-219
200 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
natural forces which all work in their own way. Mans 
power to do depends on his knowledge. Further, every 
new mechanical contrivance starts with knowledge of its 
predecessor. Invention is built on invention, which — 
means that the starting-point for every new machine is 
the less perfect machine. Even the first machine of a 
kind grew out of knowledge of contrivances more or 
less similar in function and in construction. Anyone 
who will compare an early type-writer with a type-writer 
of to-day will see the advance made in a very few decades. 
The following example is as typical as it is striking— 
‘All the world knows by this time that the great 
Cunard liner Mauretania left Liverpool for New York 
on Saturday evening with the hope and intention, if 
human skill and labour can achieve the feat and are not 
baffled by the uncontrollable vicissitudes of weather, 
_, Wind, and sea—as it now seems not unlikely that they 
ai beat only of reaching New York to-night, but of teaching Fishguard on the return voyage on Thursday, 
December’ 22-that is, on the twelfth day after her 
departure from Liverpool... 
. “She will carry 1,100 passengers out to New York 
-* and 1,800 back to England. As her normal ship’s com- 
pany consists of over 800 persons and she has shipped 
an extra number of firemen, it follows that she will catty 
some 2,000 persons in all on her outward trip and nearly 
3,000 on her return. In order to accomplish her task 
she will have to steam across the Atlantic and back at 
an average speed of 26 knots, or to travel between 600 
and 700 nautical miles a day, and her coal consumption 
will be about 1,000 tons per day, probably rather more 
than less. The earliest steam Cunarder to cross the 
Atlantic was the Britannia, built in 1840. She was4  
-P-A-G-E-220
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS = 201 
wooden paddle steamer 207 feet long, which is less than 
two and a half times the width of the Mauretania, with 
a gross tonnage of 1,154 tons, as compared with the 
Mauretania’s 31,938 tons, and an indicated horse-power 
of 740, not much more than a hundredth part of that 
of the Mauretania. Her cargo capacity was 225 tons, 
and she carried 115 cabin passengers. Her average sea 
speed was 8.5 knots, and her coal consumption was 38 
tons per day. The evolution of less than 70 years is 
here very vividly exhibited.” ! 
The essence of the practical interest is, therefore, not 
that it does not seek knowledge, but that it seeks it 
for ends beyond itself. The purpose is to do some- 
thing ; to that everything isa means. It may be only 
an indirect means, for we may be unable to alter that 
of which we have knowledge, but only to determine 
our own action. For example, we seek knowledge of 
the weather in order that we may regulate our goings 
out and comings in, or if that be not in our power, that 
we may at least make suitable provision against rain or 
snow. Thus, within a practical interest there may be 
an intellectual interest to know. Really the knowledge 
is needed for the practical purpose, but it may be seen 
to be so essential to that purpose that its attainment 
becomes a subordinate end in itself. Then the practical 
purpose is put aside for the time, and energy is thrown 
into the theoretical interest. Often, perhaps generally, 
both practical and intellectual interests are excited by the 
same object, though either may be so dominant, either 
always or at any one time, that it obscures the other. 
Practical interest in its most exaggerated form is seen 
in the desire to use the results obtained by the intel- 
1 The Times, Dec. 15th, 1910.
-P-A-G-E-221
202 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
lectual work of others as mere formulas, without any 
real understanding of them. This, indeed, defeats its 
own object, as there is no flexibility about such borrowed 
summaries, and for all original practical work adaptability 
is essential. So this kind of practical person is the man 
of prejudices and rules of thumb, the convinced lover 
of ‘red-tape’, the fine flower of bureaucracy. 
In social life the practical interest is concerned with 
our relations to others and with their relations to our- 
selves.. It has, thus, an element of egoism. But it is 
not necessarily selfish in the narrow sense. It is founded 
both in the instincts of self and in those which relate to 
others. The interest may be that others should think 
well of one, should love one, should trust one. Such 
practical interests are, we hope and believe, more 
common and more powerful among children than the 
natrowly selfish interests of gaining reward or avoiding 
punishment. In these, indeed, the reference is not only 
to persons but subordinately to things. 
We have considered the working of practical interest 
in adult life where its effects are most obvious. Its 
nature is the same in children, though the objects to 
which it is attached, and the productions to which it 
gives birth, are different. “We have seen that it prompts 
to the doing of something with the hands as well as with 
the head ; that it learns in connexion with such bodily 
activity ; that learning seems of worth just because it 
leads to making. I do not anticipate any contradiction 
when I state that this is the characteristic attitude of 
childhood. But if that be granted the conclusion to 
which it leads is that children will learn best when their 
learning is part of a practical activity. It is true they 
have the instinct of curiosity which prompts them to

-P-A-G-E-222
DEVELOPMENT OF [INTERESTS 203 
ask questions and makes them ready to hear about things 
outside their experience. Even these they delight to 
act, and within their immediate experience curiosity 
works hand in hand with constructiveness. That which 
satisfies both instincts is of more educational worth than 
that which gratifies only one. The influence of an 
exaggeratedly intellectualistic adult psychology on the 
training of the young could hardly be more plainly 
shown than in the practical assumption that the interests 
of children are predominantly theoretical. 
Not only psychology but physiology teaches this same 
lesson. Youth is the time for the organization of 
nervous circuits, and if they are not formed then they 
either cannot be formed at all or they are imperfectly 
formed and that with much difficulty. Further, it is 
established that the large regions of the cortex which 
are primarily concerned with the control and movements 
of the limbs are intimately connected with those which 
specially subserve intellectual operations. If either be 
inadequately cultivated the other also suffers. So that 
exclusive devotion in school to intellectual pursuits 
defeats its own ends, not only directly as failing to arouse 
the most characteristic interests, but indirectly as arresting 
that elaboration of cortical connexions from which intel- 
lectual development cannot be separated. That this is 
Rot mere theorizing has been proved by definite experi- 
ment. In an address to the Scottish Sloyd Association,? 
Sir Harry Reichel gives the following— 
“Cheetham’s Hospital is an old endowed Bluecoat 
School of the higher elementary type. Mr. Mather, 
who was on the Governing Body, paid a visit to the 
United States, and was greatly impressed with the

204 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
manual work carried on in the common schools. On 
his return he proposed that something of the same kind 
should be attempted in Cheetham’s Hospital. To this 
both Governors and staff presented a united front of 
opposition. The former regarded it as a fad. Boys 
went to school to read books and become clever men, 
not to waste their time whittling wood. The latter pro- 
tested that the school time-table was as full as it could 
hold, that they had to satisfy H.M.’s Inspector, and 
that if anything further were introduced, they would not 
be answerable for the consequences. The position 
seemed hopeless enough. Mr. Mather, however, did 
not lose heart. He asked that an experiment should be 
made for one year, of which he would bear the whol, 
cost himself. He would build the necessary workrooms. 
Let half the boys go on as before, and the other half 
spend four hours a week taken from the ordinary school 
hours in systematic Handwork. At the end of the 
school year let all be examined in the book subjects; 
then if it should appear that those who had done the 
Handwork were seriously behind their companions in 
the book subjects, he would admit. that Governors and 
staff were right, and would clear away the workrooms 
and plant at his own expense. So fair and public-spirited 
an offer it was difficult to refuse. The workrooms were 
built, and the dual curriculum was carried on for a year. 
At the close came the test examination, and then it 
appeared not only that the boys who had devoted four 
hours less a week to book study were not behind the 
others in any of the book subjects, but that in the 
Mathematical part they were markedly in front of them, 
more particularly in Geometry. The experiment was 
crucial and decisive.. Handwork has ever since been an

integral part of the curriculum of Cheetham’s Hospital. 
A year or two later I visited the school, and was shown 
round by one of the masters, who enthusiastically con- 
firmed the account I had received. ‘We masters, he 
said, ‘were entirely opposed to it at first ; but now we 
regard it as our best friend.’ We were passing through 
the woodwork room at the moment; he picked up a 
piece of wood which had been cut to the shape of a 
triangle. ‘You see, sir,? he remarked, ‘a boy who is 
constantly making shapes like this gets a much clearer 
idea of what is meant by an angle and a triangle than 
one who merely looks at figures in a book.’ ‘In short, 
I said, ‘it may be regarded as a kind of laboratory 
Practice in Euclid” ‘ Indeed, sir, that’s just about what 
it is?” 
Tt may be noted next that the only interests which 
can be indirectly connected with purpose are practical. 
Of course, if the purpose be to make a box or to cultivate 
a garden successfully, the interest in all the activities 
that lead to the desired result is direct, and the interest 
in the pertinent knowledge is so extremely closely con- 
nected with it that only theoretically can it be looked 
upon as indirect. But unless a direct intellectual interest 
can be aroused in ordinary lessons the purpose itself is 
external, and the interest even in it is only indirect, and 
takes the practical form of avoiding reproof or securing 
the approbation either of another or of one’s own con- 
science. It has already been granted that such interests 
cannot be banished either from school or from life. 
That, however, is quite another thing from consenting 
that they should be given an artificial dominance. More- 
over, let it not be forgotten that a school which cordially 
welcomes a child’s real interests will secure his good will
-P-A-G-E-225
206 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
in those tasks in which such natural interest is not felt 
much more than will the school which ignores them. 
Nor is this a small gain. 
Interest is intellectual when the purpose is to know 
all we can about that part of reality. The interesting 
object will be studied both in its qualities and in its 
relations to other objects. As knowledge increases the 
interest is more and more in wide and abstract relations, 
and it is then that it is most appropriately termed 
theoretical. This is a distinction due only to the kind 
of object to which the interest is attached. From the 
standpoint of the mind which feels the interest 
there is no such difference. The aim is to reach the 
truth. 
Theoretical interest differs from practical interest not 
in its objects but in its purposes. Questions of utility, 
whether wide or narrow, do not concern it. That some 
practical inventor may make use of his discoveries is 
neither here nor there to the man whose interest is 
essentially intellectual. As men are never merely pure 
intellect, however, they cannot be confined to really 
theoretical interests. Just as the practical person must 
have enough interest in knowledge to obtain that which 
is instrumental to him, so the lover of abstract truth 
must have regard to mundane considerations. In most 
cases his interests are probably somewhat mixed. He 
may desire to advance knowledge, but he may at the 
same time be by no means oblivious of the fame or 
wealth it may bring him. If the latter be really domi- 
nant, then his interest is essentially practical, though at 
first it looks as if it were theoretical. His intellectual 
pursuits are means to an end; they are not followed for 
their own sakes. Few men in any age are like Brown-

DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS = 207 
ing’s typical Renaissance scholar who “decided not to 
Live but Know ”— 
«Let me know all! Prate not of most or least, 
Painful or easy !””1 
If this be so with adults, what can be expected with 
children? The argument is not that they are incapable 
of purely intellectual interests, but that it is very 
exceptional, if not quite unknown, that such interests 
should be the chief things in their lives. So the common 
scholastic experience is that extraneous incentives are 
needed in most lessons, and that even then the result 
is no very startling exhibition of zestful energy. 
Let it be noted, too, that intellectual interest can be 
but scant till it has a fair amount of knowledge already 
acquired on which to work. It concerns itself with the 
more hidden qualities of things and with their systematic 
tehtions. It is consequently an interest that we should 
expect to grow with the child’s growth. But it must 
gtow out of the true seed. That is where schools so 
often go psychologically wrong. ‘They are apt to assume 
at if you want a mental process to be operative in 
youth or manhood you should begin practising just that 
form of process in childhood. ‘That implies that the 
child starts with fully competent faculties only needing 
exercise, whereas he starts with a few indefinite instincts 
Which in practice branch out into many more complex 
and more mature forms. The surest way to secure 
intellectual interest in later years is to let it be the flower 
from the root of practical interest. 
The different modes in which the theoretical and 
Practical interests regard the same object may be illus-

trated by the following problem culled from the mathe- 
matical columns of The Educational Times ‘—“ Two men 
wish to buy a grindstone, 42 inches in diameter, and 
1 foot thick at the centre. To what thickness at the 
outer edge should the stone uniformly taper from the 
centre, that each man may grind off 18 inches of the 
diameter and both have equal shares, the central 6 inches 
of the diameter being waste?” It may safely be assumed 
that no two workmen could be found on earth who 
would desire to perform the suggested operation. The 
interest is purely theoretical. Such an example may 
bring home to teachers the truth that the mere clothing 
of a mathematical problem in concrete terms does not 
make it a concrete—that is, a practical—problem. 
That the intellectual interest develops gradually in 
life is evident when we consider its reference to people. 
It begins in the child’s interest in his mother and others 
closely connected with him—an interest springing from 
love. Here it is inextricably combined with the practical 
interest in the effect of their actions on himself. Still 
it is there, and will imperceptibly blossom into interest 
in wider circles as the more complex forms of sympathy 
develop from the simpler kindly emotions. In its 
developed or theoretical form the object of the interest 
is essentially the relations of men to each other as shown 
in institutions, customs, laws, wars, treaties. It is the 
root of all taste for history and geography. 
The severely theoretical interest in institutions of the 
most scientific historian or publicist, then, originates in 
personal interest in those in close relation to us. The 
development from the one to the other is gradual and 
continuous, and is both the child and the parent of 
1 April, 1910.  
-P-A-G-E-228
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 209 
advanced knowledge. A small boy entering a boarding 
school, and finding the rules and regulations of unex- 
pected strictness, will probably infer that the head master 
isa “grumpy old beast”. His interest in institutions 
still concentrates itself in a person, and is still bound 
up with his practical interest in the way those institutions 
ae likely to affect himself. So, too, a boy or girl is 
much more likely to obey rules when the weak academic 
interest in them is strengthened by a more powerful 
personal interest in the teacher. In that case the personal 
interest in the consequences of infringement is much less 
brought into play, and development towards breadth of 
social outlook is so far helped. 
We see, then, that both practical and intellectual 
interests lead directly to activity. In the former case 
the activity is primarily bodily but is guided by intelli- 
gence, which must attain the knowledge necessary for 
the purpose, and which in the course of the activity itself 
increases that knowledge. For it is impossible to have 
dealings with any part of our surroundings, human or 
material, without learning something about it which we 
did not know before. Such knowledge whets curiosity 
and so prompts to further activity for its satisfaction, 
and this further activity, though it may involve dealing 
with material things, is essentially intellectual. This 
isby far the most usual origin of the intellectual interests. 
We may not be able to trace some particular intellectual 
interest to union with a practical interest, but that is 
because it goes back to very early life. The baby’s theo- 
itical interests are all bound up with practical interests. 
The most highly developed theoretical interest 
io involves incidentally some bodily activity. The’ 
Sientific discoverer works in his laboratory, the

210 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
student of humanity in his library. But these prac- 
tical activities are altogether subordinate and ancillary. 
Conversely, in the life of the narrowly utilitarian the 
intellectual activity is incidental. That, above all, 
education should strive to prevent by the cultivation of 
real intellectual interests. It is because we esteem such 
interests highly, not because we fail to appreciate their 
importance, that we urge that practical interests should 
also find scope in school, in order that the intellectual 
interests themselves may be developed naturally, and so 
be more likely to attain their full strength than if they 
be prematurely cultivated in a barren soil. 
By emotional interests we mean those which induce 
absorption in the object itself without directly prompting 
to any practical or intellectual activity. The term is not 
a happy one because, as has been seen, there is a funda- 
mental element of emotion in all interest. The most 
typical form of this interest is the artistic, though it is 
not the only one. In contemplating a work of art one 
gives oneself up to it, and its beauty fills one’s whole 
being. The mind is not passive; but its activity is 
receptive and responsive, not originative or directive, 
as in the other forms of interest. The tendency of such 
a preponderance of emotion is to inhibit as far as possible 
the working both of intelligence and of activity. We 
do not think beauty, we feel it. No doubt, a love of 
pictures may prompt us to study art. Then we have 
a practical interest working through intellectual means 
towards the related purpose of a fuller appreciation of 
pictures. The result may justify the effort. The att 
interest may be increased by the additional knowledge 
so long as this latter be kept in the background. Sup- 
pose, however, that the artistic study develops at 
|
-P-A-G-E-230
a DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS = 211 
intellectual interest in pictures. Then, in looking at a 
picture the two interests may clash. For in so far as the 
intellectual interest is present it prompts to analysis and 
ciiticism, and this attitude is incompatible with that full 
giving up of ourselves to its value for us as a whole 
which is the true form of artistic interest. 
Similarly with music. A knowledge of the structure 
of a symphony may increase a musician’s aesthetic 
enjoyment. But if in hearing it the mind spends itself 
in analysis there will be little artistic interest. 
In literature, intellectual interest can never be entirely 
absent, though artistic interest may be quite wanting. 
To have some understanding of a passage is a necessary 
condition of appreciating its beauty, but enjoyment of 
beauty need not accompany intellectual comprehension. 
Indeed, much literature appeals mainly if not quite 
Wholly to the intelligence. When, however, as in poetry 
and reflective prose, an appeal is made to emotion and 
imagination, the two interests are more or less in conflict. 
Ih teading a romance, for instance, a person whose intel- 
letual interests predominate is inclined to omit the reflec- 
te and descriptive passages—in which, probably, the 
author most fully poured out his soul—in order the more 
tapidly to satisfy his intellectual interest in the develop- 
ment of the plot. When very strong such interest 
suggests looking at the last pages of’a book “‘to see 
how it ends.” People thus inclined seldom have any 
great love for poetry or for any prose which does not 
deal with facts and events, real or fictional. On the 
ther hand, emotional interest would linger over just 
those passages, and delight most in those books, which 
inthe former case were treated as negligible. This, too, 
is why it is that one enjoys such literature more and
-P-A-G-E-231
212 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
more as one becomes more and more familiar with it 
A passage committed to memory no longer rouses intel- 
lectual interest, so the emotional interest has full liberty. 
We give ourselves up to the pure enjoyment, without 
effort to understand because now we understand auto- 
matically, in the same way as we may yield ourselves 
to. a glorious picture or a noble piece of music. 
The emotional interest, indeed, is very jealous. To 
be fully felt it must reign for the time alone. The mind 
must be able to rest content in the presence of the object 
as a whole without enquiry as to its composition. 
It is evident that such an interest is quite individual. 
Two friends may enjoy the same work of art and may 
converse about their enjoyment. But the pleasure of 
each is unshareable with the other. The conversation 
expresses rather an intellectual than an emotional interest 
though emotional interest may have dominated their 
contemplation. 
As an emotional interest may lead to intellectual 
activity in its own service so it may in the same indirect 
way prompt to practical activity. While we are enjoy- 
ing a work of art the only practical interest is the 
inhibition of disturbance and distraction. We would 
resist all that would intervene between us and ouf 
enjoyment. But if the object excite not admiration by 
its beauty but repulsion by its ugliness, the emotional 
interest prompts to active measures for its removal. 
And, of course, it is the same general kind of interest 
in each case, though the one is the antithesis of the other. 
This furnishes another illustration of the truth that 
interest is not a quality of the object; for nothing 
is more proverbial than differences in estimates of 
beauty. |
-P-A-G-E-232
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 213 
In many cases emotional interest prompts to effort to 
produce like objects of emotional value. Thus delight in 
some form of art stimulates a child to learn to draw 
and to paint, to mould figures in plastic clay, to sing 
or to play on some musical instrument, to read or recite 
with elocutionary power. If the effort promise to yield 
but little fruit this derived practical interest soon decays 
—though the emotional interest may remain strong— 
and vain indeed is the attempt to galvanize it into 
artificial life. . 
A further way in which an emotional interest may 
prompt to practical activity is in incitements to search 
for the desired objects. A love of pictures may lead 
toa resolution to visit Italy, an interest in ecclesiastical 
wchitecture may give a sufficient reason for a long 
waking-tour. That, again, is a practical interest having 
asits purpose the satisfaction of aesthetic interest. The 
hatter can only be experienced in the presence of the 
Pictures or the churches, or in dwelling on them in 
imagination. 
In relation to persons the emotional interest attaches 
'o moral qualities. These excite admiration or abhor- 
rence, which are the characteristic colourings of the 
usthetic interest. At first such qualities are known only 
*s found in persons. Later they may become detached 
and idealized. Of course, an interest which leads to 
Nstification or criticism of moral principles is not 
emotional but intellectual. The emotional . interest 
spends itself in its attraction or repulsion towards the 
quality or the principle as it is. So it is the very core 
of the religious interest, though in that case it is not this 
orthat quality or principle, but goodness and beauty and 
‘atelligence combined in a Divine Person, that is the
-P-A-G-E-233
214 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
object of that interest. Its full development is seen in 
the rapt contemplation of the religious mystic—a con- 
templation conscious neither of will nor of thought, but 
only of an ecstatic absorption of the whole being into 
the Divine being. 
The emotional interest in things appears in early 
childhood in the delight of the child in striking colours, 
pleasant sounds, bright lights, sweet tastes, and so on; 
while his emotional interest in persons is shown in 
his fits of abandonment to his love for his mother. 
From these humble beginnings some can advance further 
than others. That is essentially a matter of original 
endowment. Some men never become capable of a 
higher emotional interest than the appreciation of 4 
good dinner ; some women cannot rise above the latest 
fashion in dress. How much of such defects are due 
to original lack and how much to defective training it 
is impossible to say. Certainly an education which 
limited itself to the intellectual and practical interests 
would be lamentably incomplete. 
Their importance in life make the practical and theo 
retical interests essentially those of work, while, # 
subserving our enjoyment, the emotional interests maj 
be looked on as those of play, or of the leisure time of 
life. Of course, in the hands of creative artists the 
artistic interest finds vent in real productive activity. 
The interest in the activity itself is practical, the end i 
the realization of an ideal the contemplation of whit 
will give the highest pleasure. But it is in relation with 
the development of appreciation that the ordinary school 
sets itself to supply scope for artistic interests. It am

soul and the beautiful object must be formed spon- 
taneously ; there is no forging it from without. 
We are led, then, to this: that an education worthy 
of the name must call forth every class of interest, and 
must provide suitable material for its exercise. The 
neglect of any one means a defective life. To emphasize 
one class of interests because they are the strongest in 
the life is justifiable, provided that the others are pro- 
vided for according to their strength. To do more— 
to concentrate in boyhood and youth on some one special 
field in which one class of interests may work—is utterly 
indefensible. The premature specialization to which the 
great division of labour in all branches of learning is 
leading is nothing short of disastrous. Certainly we 
need culture in relation to surroundings, for only in 
teation to surroundings can interests grow. But this 
does not mean exclusive, or nearly exclusive, devotion 
to the pursuits of the neighbourhood. Wherever a 
person lives, he is related by direct and indirect ties to 
all the world. Any part of it may enter into his environ- 
ment through the gate of imagination. This enlarge- 
ment of the realm of interest, which is especially the 
work of the school, is a necessary means to the thorough 
understanding and appreciation of the home surround- 
ings themselves. We know nothing by itself, but only 
in telation to other things. As the home knowledge 
isthe foundation on which knowledge of what is outside 
that range must be built, so knowledge of the latter 
gives fullness and meaning, and so adds interest, to the 
former. Every one who has travelled in foreign 
countries will appreciate the force of these considerations.

216 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
The educational problem, indeed, is the enlargement 
and systematization of interests. To the extent to which 
inner connexion is attained the outer life shows as dis- 
tinctly purposeful. An extreme instance of thorough 
unification of interests is Dr Conan Doyle’s well-known 
creation,. Mr Sherlock Holmes. The whole of life is 
there represented as dominated by the interest of solving 
problems of human conduct, especially those connected 
with crime. Every kind of information which had ho 
connexion with that was dismissed from the mind. 0 
we have a list of Mr Holmes’ acquirements which 
without the knowledge supplied by his purpose appears 
motiveless in its eccentricity. ‘‘ Philosophy, astronomy, 
and politics were marked at zero.... Botany variable, 
geology profound as regards the mud stains from any 
region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, 
anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime 
records unique, violin player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, 
and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.” This main 
interest operated by its general determination of conduct, 
and found expression in the special interests of particular 
cases, Each of these in turn absorbed the whole mental 
energy, to be dismissed when the solution had beer 
reached, 
Similarly, the interest of a barrister or of a doctor ia 
particular cases is a special manifestation of the genettl 
professional interest in law and medicine. Certainly the 
whole of life should not be governed by one profession#! 
interest. Even Sherlock Holmes sought relaxation ia 
his violin and in cocaine injections. On the other hand, 
unless the various classes of operative interests be cot- 
nected together in this typical way life will be desultory 
and ineffective.

DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS = 217 
Interests can only grow in the environment, so that if 
when they ripen a child’s natural activities do not find 
appropriate and varied opportunities to give them full 
scope, development will be arrested or narrowed. It is, 
therefore, of the first importance to know the kinds of 
interests a child instinctively feels at successive periods, 
and the key to this knowledge must be sought in his 
actions. 
The doctrine of evolution seemed to open an attractive 
prospect of studying the development of the child on 
awide and extended scale. May not each child’s life be 
assumed to recapitulate in brief the mental history of 
the race? Certainly our instincts are inherited from our 
forefathers. But they mature in our own lives, in our 
own surroundings, and express our own needs. By 
fixing on some of a child’s activities and ways of looking 
at things a superficial resemblance may be found to some 
of the actions of savages or backward races. The vast 
majority, however, of the acts and thoughts both of the 
child and of the savage are perforce omitted from the 
comparison, for it is evident that the child, simply because 
he is a child with some of his most powerful instincts 
as yet undeveloped, cannot in all points resemble an 
adult savage. A child’s playful forages bear no essential 
resemblance to the hunting expeditions on which the 
sustenance of the savage and his family depends. 
Throughout, the resemblance is in one aspect of an outer 
act, not in motive, nor in interest, nor in the social 
setting in which the activity is exercised. 
To make the theory work it has been necessary to 
construct a primitive man. This Mr Herbert Spencer 
did by an ingenious combination of records gathered 
impartially from prehistoric times and from contemporary
-P-A-G-E-237
218 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
savage life. But, as M. Ribot remarks, “nothing 
proves that this picture will suit all classes; there have 
existed not one primitive man, but primitive men 
differing considerably, according to race and environ- 
ment.”! No further comment seems needed on that 
pedantic German invention known as ‘culture epochs’, 
These begin with this mythical personage and come down 
to the present day, claiming to lead the child by the age 
of fourteen through all the supposed successive stages 
of human development. 
Nothing but careful and wide observation will give 
the required knowledge in any detail, and the records of 
such observations are by no means adequate. Many 
merely give single anecdotes detached from the life and 
circumstances of the child, and recording only age and 
sex. Others are gathered from children’s own answers 
to questions, from which an attempt is made to reach 
a kind of average result. All such records are sus 
ceptible of various hypothetical interpretations. The 
child’s estimate of his likes and dislikes will be coloured 
by the recency or remoteness of the pleasant or unpleasant 
experiences ; and his desire to pose or to give the answer 
he believes to be desired or expected will often distort his 
statements without any deliberate intention to deceive. 
If answering the questions be voluntary there can be 
no assurance that the combined result is typical, for 
children of practical temperament will be likely to appear 
in a much smaller proportion than they are in actual 
life; if it be not voluntary the probability of vitiation 
by deliberate obscuring of the inner life, or by careless- 
ness or forgetfulness, is increased. All results obtained 
by this method must, therefore, be used with the utmost 
Psychology of the Emotions (Eng. trans.), p. 288,
-P-A-G-E-238
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS = 219 
caution. At the best they give suggestions which may 
be of use in our own observations. 
We are left, then, with actual personal study of 
children as the one means of gaining a real knowledge 
of their interests in relation to their lessons. Of course, 
each educator does, with more or less success, gather some 
knowledge of his children’s interests. But the teacher 
is so bound by tradition, often existing in the form of 
pedantic ‘Regulations’ of some Education Authority, 
that his observations on the point are apt to be “‘cabined, 
cribbed, confined.” What is especially needed is careful 
and judicious investigation of what subjects and what 
parts of subjects are found to be most interesting to 
children in general during the successive years of school 
life. This interest must be judged solely by its effects 
on mental and practical activity. It is no use asking 
the children. They will in most cases tell you what 
amuses them most, or has entertained them most recently. 
The only way to get at the truth is to watch their work. 
Ifa child give time to a subject out of school hours his 
interest in it is thereby proved to be alive. In schools, 
and especially boarding schools, in which various leisure- 
hour pursuits—such as some branch of natural history, 
photography, manual work, study of architecture or of 
archeology—are encouraged, the general tendency of an 
individual’s interests are easily seen, and also the possible 
changes they may undergo as he increases in years. 
If teachers in large numbers would collect and publish 
the results of such observations we should be able to 
make some approach to a knowledge much more precise 
than we have now as to the constitution of a really 
educative Time-table. No doubt there would be varia- 
tions in the results observed, according to the skill and
-P-A-G-E-239
220 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
enthusiasm of various teachers. But with a large 
number these would tend to eliminate each other, the 
specially good results in the excitement of interest due 
to the genius in teaching being balanced by the specially 
bad ones obtained in the same subject with similar 
children by less capable teachers. There would remain 
guidance for the teachers who want it most, if only 
because they are the most numerous—the worthy but 
somewhat commonplace folk who form the majority 
in every walk of life. To be of value such reports must 
be definite. They should state explicitly the age and 
sex of the pupils, the kind of matter selected, the method 
in which it is taught, the proofs of interest shown, and 
also the situation of the school, especially with regard 
to town or country and to the social class of its scholars. 
With such real material to guide us we should find, 
I venture to prophesy, that modifications of considerable 
extent, though, perhaps, mainly in matters of detail and 
of emphasis, would be needed to fit schemes of study 
to schools differing much in these respects. 
When we know what the results of the present schemes 
of instruction are, both the need and the direction of 
more fundamental changes will become evident. If it 
be found quite general that certain kinds of lessons fail 
to inspire to any degree the children who have to learn 
them, then those lessons are at least open to grave sus- 
picion, They may not only waste time; they may 
hinder the formation of some other interest. Very 
strong extraneous reasons would be needed to justify 
their retention. Possible substitutes should be tested 
and judged in the same way. So I urge that before 
teachers condemn educational psychology as failing to 
give them all the detailed guidance they wish, they
-P-A-G-E-240
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 221 
should contribute to such psychology the matter which 
they only are in a position to give in the necessary detail 
and with the necessary exactness, and on which alone it 
canwork. Of abstract assumptions and deductions from 
them there have been enough and more than enough. 
Until more exact knowledge, gathered by careful obser- 
vation over a wide area, is available, the exposition of 
the order of the development of children’s interests can 
only be an outline sketch wanting both in precision and 
in definiteness of contents. 
A child’s interests at any time express the degree to 
which he is able to co-ordinate himself with his environ- 
ment. This isa continually developing process, marked 
on the one side by growing power of dealing with 
objects, and on the other by increase in the variety and 
complexity of the objects dealt with as they appear to 
the child. Throughout, the interest advances through 
effort ; that which simply determines movement from 
without awakens no interest, because the movement so 
determined is outside the sphere of desire and purpose. 
The stages of the development are, therefore, marked 
by the characteristic activity of each. To speak of 
‘stages’ implies no precise limits nor any exact uni- 
formity in development among children. Each child, 
indeed, may be said to have three ages—the physio- 
logical, the mental, and that attested by the registrar of 
births—and these three do not always coincide. Still, 
there are periods marked by characteristic activities, if 
not by exact age boundaries, whose names are embedded 
in common thought and speech. 
The age of infancy, up to some two or two and a half 
years, falls outside our province. The baby’s life is 
essentially responsive to outside stimuli. It is learning
-P-A-G-E-241
222 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
to distinguish between itself and objects about it, and 
is busy getting into relation through language with other 
minds. But purpose is not separated from impulse, and 
education, as distinguished from nurture and as meaning 
control through influence on will, can hardly be said to 
begin. Those specially interested in this time of life 
will find several careful monographs dealing with it. 
The stage of childhood, which lasts till somewhere 
between five and a half and seven, is one in which the 
interests centre essentially in personal activity. This is 
proved by the most spontaneous activity of all—play. 
_ At first the play is the mere outpouring of surplus 
energy; it has no meaning beyond movement. Then 
it begins to be symbolic. A little boy of four will 
prance round a room on a walking-stick calling it a horse, 
not because he fancies any resemblance to a horse but 
because the idea of the object is of no importance at all. 
The activity is all that counts, and the whole value of the 
stick is that the child can put a leg on each side of it and 
still move with perfect freedom. Similarly, the interest 
in a rocking horse is in its rocking capabilities, not in 
its greater or less resemblance to a living horse. In so 
far as the latter intrudes into the child’s consciousness 
it prevents the full absorption in activity which is what 
the child instinctively wants.. The uneducative effect 
of elaborate toys is obvious. 
The child chiefly plays alone. He may use other 
persons as objects to call out his own activity, but his 
play is essentially just that activity. When he begins 
to seek the approval and admiration of his elders he is 
beginning to take the next step in his progress. 
This aspect of valuing things as occasions of activity 
is found throughout this period, of which play is the
-P-A-G-E-242
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 223 
characteristic form of expression. Each thing is dealt 
with asa whole and in large and broad movements. The 
nerve co-ordinations formed are those which govern the 
larger muscles. The child is not interested in details 
and is not capable of dealing effectively with them. 
Though the interest is predominantly in the activity, 
and things are valued as they enter into that activity, 
yet this awakens of necessity the instinct of curiosity. , 
The child soon begins to ask questions, though at first _ 
many of them evince no real intellectual activity. Any 
answer suffices, yet the question is often repeated several 
times. Part, at any rate, of early questioning may be 
regarded as only one of the forms of responsive activity 
to which objects stimulate the child. The question is 
often asked more for its own sake than for the sake of 
an answer. 
The transition from childhood to the next stage may 
be regarded as begun when a child shows any sign of 
Wanting to be able to connect things in some sort of 
explanation, The questioning becomes definite and per- 
sistent, and the same tendency to connexion is seen in 
the growing purposiveness of the child’s activity. He 
loves stories whch bring together things in his experi- 
ence, and is content to accept the marvellous. The 
essence of his enjoyment is that the tales show some sort 
of coherence, and bring out strongly simple and appro- 
pine consequences. of actions which he esteems good or 
It is now that the child desires to work as well as to 
play—a desire which should assuredly be gratified. This 
is very well illustrated in a short conversation between 
aprofessor of education anda little boy of barely six years 
old who attended a kinder-garten. ‘Well, Harry, do
-P-A-G-E-243
224 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
you like going to the kinder-garten?” ‘‘'No, I don’t.” 
“Why, isn’t the teacher kind to you?” ‘Oh, yes; 
she’s all right ; but I want to go to school to learn to do 
sums.” As is characteristic of his age he stated sym- 
bolically his wish to work, using a form of school work 
doubtless made familiar to him by his elder brother's 
. home lessons. This wish to work—to act with regard to 
something to be accomplished—may easily be choked. 
In some homes and in some schools it never flourishes; 
the whole activity finds vent in amusement and play. 
_ The product is not usually either a useful or a happy 
citizen. 
On the other hand, the premature inuring to adult 
work from which many of the children of the poor are 
not yet immune can only result in the narrowing of 
interests and a consequent decrease in the joy and value 
of life. The work itself is not that to which their natural 
interests would lead them, but is forced upon them 
entirely regardless of the springs of their own energy. 
A little street arab will fend for himself in a way impos 
sible to the public school boy of twice his age. But his 
life is narrowed to that : inall that makes for nobility and, 
in the best sense of the word, culture—the flowering of 
all his capacities—he is woefully deficient. Of the possi- 
bility of these he has been despoiled. 
The tendency towards purposive activity is see 
in the games. These are now more played in com- 
mon, and are often of a dramatic character. The 
children imitate the occupations of their elders. As 
element of reality is demanded; things and persons 
are still partly symbolic, but the symbolism must 
have some resemblance to the reality. Thus, a little 
girl likes.a doll’s house, a set of toy tea-things; *

DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 225 
boy delights in a Noah’s Ark. But the dramatizing 
must come from within, otherwise it is not an expression 
of living interest which will lead beyond itself. It is 
here that kinder-parten games may fall short by being 
made mere external exercises. Then they secure the 
shell but fail to reach the kernel. These imitative games 
ae more popular with girls than with boys, and persist 
longer in their lives. With boys over six they soon 
begin to lose their zest. 
From about six to seven is usually a time of exception- 
ally rapid bodily growth, but not of corresponding mental 
expansion. It is, indeed, a transition stage, when things 
as well as actions are beginning to press themselves on 
the child’s interest, and he has not yet learnt to accom- 
modate himself to this new point of view. 
During the next few years—those of early boyhood 
and girlhood—physical development goes on more 
sowly, but it would seem that much nervous and 
muscular co-ordination is being effected. This is shown 
by an increasing interest in things and in what can be 
done with things rather than in the doing as mere action. 
The boy more and more admires skill and the success in 
doing to which it leads. This he feels he has not got, 
80 ke sets himself to imitate in order that he too may be 
able to do what others do. ‘These are the years in which 
deliberate imitation, not for its own sake but for the 
tesults to which it leads, is most common. Skill shows 
its growth in power to work with smaller and smaller 
details. Always it deals with single things of no great 
size. The child’s interest is so concentrated in them 
that a great whole, such as a landscape, has no meaning 
for him. 
The child, then, is still physically active, but his 
Ww P
-P-A-G-E-245
226 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
activity is more and more referred to ends external to 
himself. He acts to accomplish something ; he is not 
satisfied unless he accomplish it well; therefore his 
intellectual interests are awakened in the service of his 
practical ends. So he learns eagerly about the objects 
which he can bring into his own acts. 
The same kind of interest, in an extended form, finds 
satisfaction in stories of adventure of all kinds and in 
accounts of how peoples in strange lands do things 
analogous to those he does himself or sees others do 
around him. At first, when the interest is still chiefly 
-in the action, he is not concerned with the truth of the 
stories. But as he more and more esteems his activity 
on account of the actual results it brings to pass he 
wants to know whether what he is told be true. It is 
not that he banishes fiction from his interests, but that 
he wants to put it in its proper place as play ministering 
to emotional interest, not as work nourishing directly 
intellectual interest and indirectly practical interest and 
having a real meaning in life. 
‘The games characteristic of this period show the same 
features. They develop muscular co-ordinations and 
judgement of sense impressions, and they are expressive 
of the growing feeling of the self as producing more‘ot 
less successful results. So there is a great development 
of competitive and emulative games, especially among 
boys. They delight to play together, but not for# 
commonend. The association is one of place and time, 
not one of purpose. They pit themselves against eatt 
other in running, leaping, throwing. They dare each 
other to feats of derring-do. This is charmingly e 
pressed in John Heywood’s Play of the Wether. The 
gods under the presidency of Jupiter are met to decide
-P-A-G-E-246
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 227 
the kind of weather which is best for mankind. Typical 
people are called to give evidence, and at the end comes 
aschool-boy who testifies— 
“All my pleasure is in catchynge of byrdes, 
And makynge of snow-ballys, and throwynge the same ; 
For the whyche purpose to have set in frame, 
With my godfather god I wolde fayne have spoken, 
Desyrynge hym to have sent me by some token 
Where I myghte have had great frost for my pytfallys, 
And plente of snow to make my snow-ballys. 
This onys had, boyes Iyvis be such as no man leddys. 
O, to se my snow-ballys light on my felowes heddys, 
And to here the byrdes how they flycker theyr wynges 
In the pytfale! I say yt passeth all thynges.” 
Such trials of strength and skill bring home to a boy 
his superiority to others. His inferiority he is usually 
less willing to grant. There is always some extenuating 
circumstance. He cannot, indeed, bear to think of 
himself as incapable, and so strong and general is the 
fecling that he quite often receives the comfort of 
acquiescence from his companions when he is on good 
terms with them. When he does not he is apt to try 
at once to prove that at any rate he is superior in the 
noble art of self-defence. 
The same emulative spirit shows itself in school work, 
and it is quite permissible to make use of it. In its 
purely personal form it is characteristic only of this stage. 
As it takes on a more social form in the next stage the 
momentary quarrels to which it here leads are put away 
with other childish things. With girls individual emu- 
lition is apt to take a more bitter form and to be more 
prolonged than with boys. Exceptional care and caution 
in appealing to it are needed.
-P-A-G-E-247
228 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
By about ten years old the child has acquired a fairly 
good control of his bodily movements ; in other words, 
he has the mechanism of skill. His interest is now more 
and more in the relations of things. He delights in 
constructive work in which he can put his skill to 
practical account and see the successful output of his 
efforts. At first he is satisfied that this should be imits- 
tive, for at the beginning of a new mode of acting the 
child of about ten still feels his inefficiency. But soon 
confidence grows, and as it does so his nature more and 
more cries out for freedom of initiative. His interest 
is enormously increased when the result of his labours 
is designed, as well as executed, by himself. As it is 
a capable human being we want to turn out from our 
schools, and not a number of well-made joints or boxes 
or meat-hooks, considerations that he may spoil some 
material in his experiments should not count. What a 
vastly poorer place this world would be had inventors 
feared to spoil material! 
Planning a construction is general thought expressed 
in concrete terms. The boy or girl is, then, capable of 
such thought. But to be capable of it is to have an 
inherent need for it. The same developing power of 
systematizing experience is seen in all departments of 
activity. The boy begins to make collections of stamps, 
of butterflies, of birds’ eggs, or of something else which 
he values, and he makes some attempt to classify them. 
True, the attempts are elementary, and, especially at first, 
apt to be based on resemblances of shape and colour and 
size. Yet this is an advance. Collections made ia 
earlier years are heterogeneous both in matter and in 
arrangement. Naturally the first generalizing bonds 
which appeal to a boy or girl are those of obvious resemb- +
-P-A-G-E-248
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS = 229 
lance. Doubtless that leads to thinking some relations 
which are not justified by the facts, but further experience 
—which the school may well arrange and expedite— 
leads to criticism and revision. 
Early in this period the same love of mental inquisi- 
tiveness is shown in a very general liking for puzzles— 
at first mechanical, afterwards more purely intellectual. 
Such geometrical constructions as cutting a square.in a 
certain way so as to form another figure, or arithmetical 
enquiries like ‘‘ When Jack was asked how much money 
he had he replied, ‘If I had as much again, half as much 
again and four pence halfpenny I should have a shilling’. 
How much had Jack? are eagerly solved. Boys of 
about thirteen have been known to take delight in such 
ingenious manipulations of figures as arranging the nine 
digits in a square of three lines with three figures in 
each, so that every possible line—perpendicular, hori- 
zontal, or diagonal—adds up to fifteen; or in interpreting 
such involved statements of family relation as “If your 
father’s father is my father’s son what relation am I to 
you?” Many, too, feel a keen interest in games of 
draughts or in the solving of acrostics. 
Nothing shows more clearly the growing interest in 
relations than the development, soon after ten, of 
Co-operative games among boys. In the earlier stage 
when children play together it is for their own glory. 
Even when they join in such a game as cricket or foot- 
ball there is a tendency for each to play for his own hand. 
That tendency bit by bit dies out, and the true co-opera- 
tive spirit takes its place. This, too, means that the end. 
is sought outside the personal self. Victory is desired 
for the side, in which only the social self is gratified. 
As this spirit grows stronger the individual becomes
-P-A-G-E-249
230 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
quite willing to sacrifice his own glory—to omit a display 
of his own skill—if the doing so is to the advantage 
of the side. Nowhere but in such games is there free 
scope for the growth of this most desirable interest 
Free gymnastics cannot give it. Indeed, their effect 
on the development of social interest is at the best to 
arrest it at the competitive stage. Still less can any 
form of physical drill give it. Such exercises cannot 
affect the development of interest beyond the point of 
desiring aptitude in free movements, that is, the interest 
of childhood. Beyond that their benefits are physical 
This is the age, too, in which the growing social 
interest begins to show itself in joining, or even in found- 
ing, societies. Such movements as school clubs, scout 
patrols, boys’ brigades, furnish healthy outlets for this 
interest, which otherwise has been known to take the 
form of organizing gangs with various undesirable 
objects. Girls commonly show no great interest in 
either clubs or co-operative games. Their divergencies 
from boys become continually more marked, especially 
in all that affects social relations. 
The demand for a clear distinction of truth from fiction 
persists. Interest is excited by persons and events ; that 
is, more connexion is appreciated than in the earlier 
stage. This develops towards the end of the petiod 
into a deeper searching into relations of events, corft- 
sponding with the attempts to establish causal relations 
among things. But till the following stage both the 
knowledge and the insight stop short of a point which 
can be truly called scientific. The general remains 3 
yet tied to the concrete. 
The greater development of sympathy and under 
standing of others which is shown among other things
-P-A-G-E-250
  DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS = 231 
by the co-operative nature of play is accompanied by 
a dawning power to appreciate beauty. Pictures and 
poetry may begin to mean something more than records 
of incidents, and music more than a mode of giving 
vent to exuberance of feeling. It is not suggested for 
amoment that such things as pictures, poetry, and music, 
should now first make their appearance in the child’s 
life. They should long have been familiar. Only so 
is there much likelihood of the aesthetic value now 
arising. Familiarity as fact normally precedes apprecia- 
tion as beautiful. The emotional interest has never 
been absent. The child began with it, and, throughout, 
things as wholes have had a value for him. This recog- 
nition now takes the definite form of artistic feeling. 
The last stage on which a few words should be said 
is that of youth. The beginning of this is well marked, 
though it cannot be assigned to any particular age, and 
is usually earlier with girls than with boys. It is 
essentially the age of secondary schooling and the time 
when the mixing of the sexes in school is most open 
to question. For the differences between them now 
extend throughout the activities of life; the girls 
developing the feminine characteristics mentioned in an 
earlier chapter and the boys the virile marks of manhood. 
Physically the earlier years are marked by a great 
acceleration of growth as well as by the ripening of the 
new powers and functions of sex. When the intimate . 
relation between bodily functions and the emotions is 
temembered it is not surprising that this should be a 
time of some emotional instability. Injudicious treat- 
ment may do irreparable mischief, and may force the 
soul into morbid introspection or into antagonism to 
all constituted authority. But the educator who under-
-P-A-G-E-251
232 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
stands his business does not find it of excessive difficulty 
to replace command more and more by advice and 
suggestion. He ignores, it may be, sporadic outbursts 
of temper or despondency or extravagant joy, knowing 
that they are symptomatic only of a passing stage, and 
that mental. balance will return with the re-establishment 
of bodily equilibrium. 
The deepening of the emotional life, including a 
higher evaluation of all’ social relationships, is the most 
important characteristic of the period. It has its 
. dangers, for it may run wild in riotous imaginations or 
. in unhealthy sentimentality. A sane and cheerful 
environment, but one which does not stimulate the 
tendency to. self-concentration, provides the best con 
ditions. There is needed, too, abundant scope for the 
outlet in healthy gamés of the abundant energy of the 
boy at this period. . Probably the public school with its 
well organized games and its absence of sentimentality 
of tone is, provided the moral atmosphere be pute, #8 
good an environment as an adolescent boy can have: 
The idea that mental work should be much lightened 
at the beginning of adolescence seems to be quite a 
unjustified by observation as by theory. It is one sound 
outlet for energy, and, especially among girls, an antidote 
to emotional absorption in the self. Moreover, the 
adolescent’s intellectual interests have by no means lost” 
their activity. On the contrary they show a rapid 
extension and an attraction towards inner relations and 
meanings of things which is quite consonant with the 
other notes of the period and which makes possible 
studies which can truly be called scientific. 
Lastly, it may be noted that adolescence is emphatically 
the time when a deliberate decision is most often taken
-P-A-G-E-252
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS 233 
as to the kind of character the youth or maiden intends 
to be. There have been heroes in earlier years, but 
now the hero is consciously identified with the self as 
the ideal towards which the self is to strive. It may 
be a composite hero formed from many sources, and its 
construction may not be deliberate. But however 
formed the ideal has to stand the test of criticism till 
it satisfies the aspirations of the soul. Then, in the 
inmost recesses of the spirit it rests in holy privacy ; to 
expose it:to the world is unthinkable. All the more 
surely does it inspire and shape the life.
-P-A-G-E-253
CHAPTER VIII 
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 
I suppose the teacher who has never had an inattentive 
pupil has yet to be discovered. Admonitions of the 
type ‘‘ Now, Smith, you’re not working; pay attention!” 
or ‘‘I wish you would pay more attention, Brown” are 
more or less frequent in all classes. On the face of 
them they assume that attention is a voluntary act— 
that not only its direction but its amount is within the 
control of the pupil. 
Let us ask whether these assumptions are justified 
by an examination of our personal experience. Any 
example will serve, so we will take the reading of the 
present chapter. Why does the reader read it? The 
answer can only take us back to the reason which 
appeared under interest. He has a purpose in view 
which may be either naturally or artificially connected 
with the subject-matter. Whichever it is, this purpost 
decides that the reading shall take place. “This neces 
sarily involves attention, which is thus seen to be 
connected both with purpose and with interest. These 
are the characteristic notes of our personal activity ; they 
give the value of the activity for ourselves. So long 
as the purpose persists, attention will be fixed on the 
chapter ; in other words, that interest will be dominant 
in consciousness. If the purpose be changed, or simply
-P-A-G-E-254
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 235 
fail to operate, attention will come to an end, Of 
course, such flagging and ceasing will occur if the reader 
feel that the chapter brings him no nearer the accomplish- 
ment of his purpose. This summary examination 
consequently justifies the scholastic estimate of attention 
as a voluntary activity. It also suggests that such 
exercise of effort must be related both to purpose and 
to interest. 
Probably everybody will grant without demur that 
attention is not a constant feature of his mental life. 
There are times when he delivers himself up to simple 
enjoyment of the present, and his interest in the objects 
which fill his consciousness is emotional. He does not 
think about them; he simply accepts them without 
question—with responsive heart rather than with under- 
standing head. 
“Oh! how I love, on a fair summer’s eve, 
When streams of light pour down the golden west, 
And on the balmy zephyrs tranquil rest 
The silver clouds, far—far away to leave 
All meaner thoughts, and take a sweet reprieve 
From little cares; to find, with easy quest, 
A fragrant wild, with Nature’s beauty drest, 
And there into delight my soul deceive.”? 
That is the true holiday mood—the rest for jaded mind, 
tepose as absolute as that of the body stretched on 
the fragrant heather. The spirit is dissolved in calm 
content. ‘The very awareness of the objects around us 
is at such times vague; together they form the whole 
which wraps us round ; separately they do not exist for 
us. Of course, attention may be awakened in such a 
state. The lively manceuvres of a wasp may rouse us 
1 Keats: Sonnets.
-P-A-G-E-255
236 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
to both mental and physical activity ; the arrival of a 
friend may wake us from our mental somnolence. Then 
we have a change of state—passivity has passed into 
activity ; attention has been aroused, for the activity 
called forth has a purpose and expresses an interest. 
In such a case of repose none of the outward marks 
of attention are present, and if we were asked to what 
we were attending the question would seem futile to 
us: we could only reply that we were attending to 
nothing ; that we were not attending at all. 
There are, however, other cases in which we are 
absorbed in the object, look at it intently, and show 
the general outward signs of attention, yet in which 
there is no attitude of enquiry and no directive activity 
of mind. The only way in which we can be said to be 
attentive is that we give up our minds to the influence 
from without. All cases of emotional interest are of 
this kind. The mental activity involved is receptive 
and responsive. It has no object to attain beyond what 
is already present. No effort to understand or to develop 
meaning takes place, or, if it do, it must be practi- 
cally unconscious, or it is antithetical to the emotional 
interest. The mind is held by the object rather than 
holds it. It is not that there is pure passivity, for that 
is incompatible with mental life. In the interaction 
between the self and the environment which forms 
experience neither is ever passive. Each holds the 
other, as both a screw and the inverse groove in which 
it is inserted contribute to the binding power. But in 
such mutual gripping the emphasis of force and strength 
may be in any degree on either side. In pure emotional 
interest the object grips us: in concentrated attention 
we grip the object: but in neither case is the reciprocal
-P-A-G-E-256
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 237 
grip absent. The stronger grip determines the result. 
As when two boys wrestle one may so hold the other 
that he cannot escape while the tension is unrelaxed, 
and yet the one held is not passive but responsive and 
alert to every change in the position, so with the relation 
between inner activity and outer impression. The 
stronger grip decides the situation, but decides it in 
relation to the situation itself. 
When we allow the current of our thoughts to be 
determined by the objects around us we ought not to 
speak of ourselves as attentive. There is no purpose 
working in a line of intellectual or practical interest. 
We make no effort to determine what we shall hear or 
see next; we accept whatever comes. As an instance 
let us imagine ourselves present at a cinematograph 
show. The pictures may be excellent, and may succeed 
each other without breaks and yet without any suggestive 
connexion. Our interest may be intense; our whole 
consciousness may be filled by the show; we are so 
absorbed that we notice nothing else. We are full of 
enjoyment. But we are not full of thought. It is quite 
correct to say we are absorbed : it is confusing and mis- 
leading to say we are attentive. Of course, attention 
may be present. If the pictures raise in our minds an 
attitude of enquiry; if they form a story-series which 
we try to follow and grasp as a whole, then, so far, the 
direction of our thoughts is determined by the desire 
to understand, and we are attentive. Even then, how- 
ever, the attention is quite subordinate to the emotional 
interest. But this need not take place at all: indeed, 
the more usual attitude is one of amused contentment 
and gratified receptive recognition, in which the only 
control of consciousness we exercise is to inhibit
-P-A-G-E-257
238 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
tendencies to wanderings of thought, and these are so 
feeble when we are really strongly held by the show that 
the inhibition is unconscious. 
To bring this home more clearly—for educationally 
it is a point of first rate importance—let us imagine that 
one of the pictures suggests to us either a practical or 
a theoretical problem on which we have recently been 
engaged but which we have not yet solved. Then, 
unless we deliberately inhibit it, our thoughts begin to 
work towards the solution of the problem. Attention 
has arisen, but it has broken the state of absorption. 
It may even have taken the mind away from the pictures 
altogether. The difference between the two states is 
marked. In the one the mind is filled by a succession 
of pictures of scenes immediately recognized and de- 
manding no further effort; in the other the mind 
arranges its own series of ideas in reference to a set 
purpose. One course is accepted from without, the 
other is originated from within. In the one we look; 
in the other we think. In this latter we stretch forth 
in attention towards a desired end; in the former we 
give up our consciousness to the attraction of our sut- 
roundings. 
This determination of mental life by the attractions 
of things around is the only possibility toa baby. With 
the thoughtful adult it is comparatively rare, and is 
allowed as a holiday from the serious business of life. 
‘With many men and women, however, it plays a vety 
large part in life, dominating attention rather than 
dominated by it. People who can find no better employ- 
ment for their leisure time than some form of trivial 
amusement show by their behaviour that in relation to 
their surroundings it is not they who have the master
-P-A-G-E-258
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 239 
gtip. Consider what a vast number of the youths who 
leave school never read a book that demands thought, 
never take up any intellectual pursuit. Their stage of 
mental development is evident. Perhaps parents and 
teachers could do worse than ask themselves the reason. 
What is evidently wanting is the effective combination 
of purpose and interest. Has either home or school 
done all that was possible to cultivate it? Have they, 
perchance, done, all unintentionally, the very opposite, 
under the obsession of the superstition that interest and 
pleasure are synonymous—that absorption means atten- 
tion? 
Even, however, were the best possible means being 
taken to develop purpose and interest, it is clear that 
the younger the child the more he is held by the things 
about him. His attention, indeed, begins at first with 
his own actions. Probably the first sign of dawning 
attention a baby shows is when it begins to follow with 
its eyes a bright light or some other object which attracts 
it, Its interest in the object is emotional ; the impres- 
sion is simply pleasant. The child shows signs of satis- 
faction when the object comes into the field of vision, 
and of dissatisfaction when it is withdrawn. When it 
discovers that its own action can retain the pleasure it 
has made a tiny but distinct step towards control of the 
contents of its own consciousness. 
We saw in the last chapter that the concentration of 
interest in personal movements is characteristic of the 
frst few years of life. The child learns to guide his 
activities so that they bring about the relations he desires 
between himself and different parts of his surroundings. 
Objects are still things to like or dislike, not things to 
understand. But actions are things to master. To
-P-A-G-E-259
“240 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
them his attention is directed with this practical end in 
view. So it is that a child wanders from thing to thing, 
Except as guides or occasions for action they do not 
interest him, and the actions to which each prompts are 
isolated and soon exhausted. The thing he simply 
accepts. His interests are essentially emotional and 
practical, but the germs of intellectual interest are bound 
up with them. The awakening of this intellectual 
interest is shown when a child begins to want to know 
something more about things. Then first he really 
attends to them as things. One of my own earliest 
remembrances is, when three or four years old, cutting 
open a toy drum “‘to see where the noise came from” 
That certainly marked by an act of attention the libera- 
tion of an intellectual interest. Such manifestations at 
first are rare. 
Throughout early boyhood and girlhood interest is 
still felt less in things as they exist than in them as they 
enter into some form of personal activity. It is easiet, 
for example, to secure the attention of a child to at 
account of a tiger as a beast of prey, at one time hunter, 
at another hunted, than to a description, no matter how 
graphic or how brilliantly illustrated by pictures, of 
his appearance and structure. These latter the child 
will be keen on just so far as they are brought into the 
animals mode of life. Doubtless he will look at the 
pictures without this relation, and may even be absorbed 
in them. But he will not stink them, he will only 
receive them. There will be absorption, not attention 
To think them is to relate them to a train of ideas the 
purpose of which is to understand how a tiger lives. 
This continues after the picture is removed. But when 
the interest excited in the picture is exhausted by the
-P-A-G-E-260
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 241 
picture it is merely emotional. It has given pleasure 
or furnished entertainment, but it has not contributed 
to the building up of a structure of knowledge. That 
there is not attention is shown by the child’s indifference 
to all but the picture. 
The inference is obvious. The attention of young 
boys and girls is closely connected with actual or 
imagined activity. If, therefore, that be not appealed 
to, there may be emotional interest, but there will not 
be intellectual interest. I should be the last to assert 
that emotional interest is not worth having. Attached 
to suitable objects it is the beginning of all artistic 
culture. But emotional interest attached to objects 
which are introduced into the teaching with the express 
purpose of arousing thought, is, from the point of view 
of learning, utterly out of place. 
Here comes in the importance of going beyond the 
actual moment for the test. Absorption and attention 
are much alike in outward manifestation. In each there 
is concentration of gaze, intentness of attitude. The 
teal test comes after. ‘The younger the child the sooner 
the absorption is over, and always nothing remains 
behind but a reaction of lassitude. Has not many a 
teacher found his pupils very intent on his pictures or 
his scientific practical demonstrations, but at least equally 
slick in the other parts of thelesson? It shows confusion 
between the two states we are considering to say that 
they were attentive to the things in which they showed 
alertness, Had they been, a train of purposive thought 
would have been started even if it had not been already 
in existence; for the meaning of those things is found 
ooly ina train of thought. The very fact that the spark 
of life died out as soon as the entertainment was over

-P-A-G-E-261
242 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
proves that the interest was only emotional, and not the 
intellectual interest from which attention is born. There 
may even be this absorption in a whole lesson with little 
or no true attention, if the pictures, lantern-slides, 
“experiments,” or anecdotes, be numerous and striking. 
The intellectual value of such lessons is no greater than 
that of a cinematograph show. Unhappily, however, 
the former claim to give intellectual culture, which the 
latter frankly does not. That children should be amused 
and entertained is right enough in its way: only let us 
not think it the same as being taught or trained. 
Tt was seen in the last chapter that both emotion 
and intellectual interest may be excited by literature 
It is essential to good teaching that the teacher should 
be quite clear to which he wishes to appeal in any one 
lesson. If the passage demand thought for its elucida- 
tion, then a lesson appealing to the intellectual interest 
should precede one in which the aim is to awaken the 
emotional interest. In the former lesson the teacher's 
purpose is to arouse in the pupils a desire to under 
stand. This implies that attention must be directed to 
a line of enquiry similar in general character to one which 
seeks to understand the nature of any concrete object 
and its immediate relations to other things. Here the 
object to be analysed is a thought-construction, in which 
the thought-elements hold certain relations, and the 
whole, by poetic figure or allusion, is connected with 
much outside itself. The quest is a quest of thought, 
and the interest is intellectual. It is sometimes sad 
that apprehending the meaning of a passage is a passive 
process. This is seen to be erroneous when it is recog- 
nized that the meaning of another’s expression of bis 
thought must be sought as surely as the meaning of
-P-A-G-E-262
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 243 
physical occurrences. Whoever has tried to master such 
apoem as Browning’s The Ring and the Book, or such a 
philosophical work as Hegel’s Logik will grant that the 
quest may be as difficult as the discovery of the habits 
of wasps or even of the nature of radium. The mistake 
arises from confusion between seeking the meaning and 
contemplating it when found. In each case the mind 
accepts the discovered fact; but also in each case the 
fact has first to be discovered. 
One may hope that in a lesson dealing with the intel- 
lectual grasp of a poem there may be an undercurrent of 
emotional interest at the bottom of many of the pupils’ 
minds. A consideration, however, of the opposition 
between intellectual and emotional interest will lead us 
to the decision that in that lesson it had better rest there. 
Alater reading, when no talk of meaning need be intro- 
duced, should be devoted to stirring this interest strongly 
and making it predominant. In such a reading we aim 
not at attention but at absorption, and attention’ should 
play the very subordinate part of so following the piece 
that the object of emotional interest is formed in the 
mind, Evidently the introduction of questions, which . 
always provokes the intellectual attitude, is fatal to 
Success, 
Further, the antithesis between emotional and intel- 
lectual interest suggests that with younger boys and 
girls the passages of literature intended to rouse an 
emotional interest should be simple in idea and expres- 
sion, so as to require no extended activity of the 
intellectual interest. For this is likely to remain attached 
to the poem and to be fatal to any real emotional effect. 
A silent reading to get the drift of the passage; a 
question or two to make sure that it has been grasped ;
-P-A-G-E-263
244 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
then an impressive reading by the teacher is the most 
probable road to success. Again it is absorption not 
attention that is required. 
When the distinction has been thoroughly grasped it 
will be found to solve more than one scholastic puzzle. 
Children have been absorbed in a lesson or a series of 
lessons, and have shown at the end knowledge neither 
of the facts nor of their relations: the interest excited 
has been more emotional than intellectual; there has 
been little or no attention. Boys and girls who have 
shown a liking for school lessons drop them all directly 
they leave school: again the failure to excite real intel- 
lectual interest is the cause. School children, it is too 
often justly lamented, do not develop persistence and 
perseverance under difficulties : this, too, because absorp- 
tion has taken the rightful place of attention in their 
lives, 
Even when the course of ideas is determined from 
Within it is not always guided by purpose or controlled 
by attention. The most typical case is when ina reverie 
or day-dream we let our thoughts wander where they 
will. Then it is not the present surroundings whic 
hold us, but images derived from the past, now ia 
familiar form, now in new and ever varying combine 
tions. To all around us we may be quite oblivious 
To the onlooker we may seem to be intent on a train of 
thought. Yet we are exercising no mastery over tht 
sequence of our ideas, we are seeking no purpose, ¥ 
are putting forth no directive energy. As before, at anf 
moment the condition of things may be changed. Some 
idea in the train of musing may rouse a dormant interes 
and immediately we may begin to direct our thoughts 
by attention towards a special object.

“« [maginings will hover 
Round my fire-side, and haply there discover 
Vistas of solemn beauty, where I'd wander 
In happy silence, like the clear Meander 
Through its lone vales; and where I found a spot 
Of awfuller shade, or an enchanted grot, 
Or a green hill o’erspread with chequer’d dress 
OF flowers, and fearful from its loveliness, 
Write on my tablets all that was permitted, 
All that was for our human senses fitted. 
Then the events of this wide world I’d seize 
Like a strong giant, and my spirit tease, 
Till at its shoulders it should proudly see 
Wings to find out an immortality.” 
Until attention “‘like a strong giant” does seize the 
direction the state is one of mental play; the mind is 
held by the attraction of its own images. 
If, after a time of musing, one succeeds in recalling 
the mental wanderings in any completeness one is amazed 
to find how extensive and, at first sight, disconnected 
they have been. Yet there has been no break in the 
thin. In all the divergencies every point of new 
departure has belonged in some way both to the preced- 
ing and to the succeeding topic. Both Edgar Allan Poe 
and Conan Doyle have made their ideal reasoners amaze 
their companions by recalling a train of musing which 
observation had enabled them to trace. That we may 
all have the same definite sequence before us I will quote 
Mr Sherlock Holmes’ reproduction of Dr Watson’s 
Feverie, as containing more familiar topics than the more 
ingenious and elaborate train imagined by Poe: 
“After throwing down your paper, which was the action which 
dew my attention to you, you sat for half 2 minute with a vacant 
  Keats: Sleep and Poetry.
-P-A-G-E-265
246 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly 
framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in 
your face that a train of thought had been started. But it did not lead 
very far. Your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of Henry 
Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books, You then 
glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious. 
You were thinking that if the portrait were framed, it would just 
cover that bare space and correspond with Gordon’s picture over there.’ 
’ €You have followed me wonderfully!’ I exclaimed. 
‘So far 1 could hardly have gone astray. But now your thoughts 
went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were 
studying the character in his features, Then your eyes ceased to 
pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was thought- 
ful. You were recalling the incidents of Beecher’s career. I wa 
well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the 
mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of 
the Civil War, for I remember you expressing your passionate 
indignation at the way in which he was received by the mort 
turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it, that I knew 
you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also. 
When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the picture, 
I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and 
when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your 
hands clenched, I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the 
gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. 
But then, again, your face grew sadder ; you shook your head. You 
were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life. 
Your hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered 
on your lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this 
method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your 
mind, At this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous, and 
was glad to find that aJl my deductions had been correct.’ ”? 
An examination of this train brings out very clearly 
the purposeless character of the whole. There are little 
trains of sequent ideas, which ‘‘did not lead very far”. 
Attention, when present at all, was too feeble to keep 
1 The Resident Patient.
-P-A-G-E-266
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 247 
hold of any topic. Some attention certainly did come 
incidentally into the Beecher series, for there was 
deliberate recall of connected events, but there was no 
purpose to reach a definite result, to solve a particular 
problem, or to answer a specific question. Thus the 
train of musing as a whole shows no attention to any 
one matter. It is not fruitful and deliberate thought ; 
it leads nowhere in particular, and were it not interrupted 
it might go on indefinitely with continual changes of 
subject. 
The points of new departure in this train are easy to 
explain. A newly framed picture suggests another and 
unframed picture ; that leads to the ideas of framing and 
hanging. Here this small train naturally ended ; it had 
exhausted itself. So the mind reverted to the previous 
point of departure and from it set off on a new series. 
In this, the picture of Beecher suggested the man, which 
naturally raised in succession the chief everits of his life. 
None was dwelt on till the Civil War was reached. This 
by its emotional interest held the mind. But now the 
general topic war took the thoughts to that other war 
in which Dr Watson had himself been wounded. This 
brought back the memory of the wound, and the un- 
pleasant character of that experience raised images of 
the suffering inseparable from war, and doubts as to the 
general wisdom of international appeals to arms. 
If we consider these junction-points we see that they 
may be of any character, but that each contains an 
element common to the two experiences it unites. 
‘Picture? is a common class with many particular 
instances, so that any one instance may suggest any other 
through this common agreement. It is as if we had 
once suffered ship-wreck. Not only that steamer or that
-P-A-G-E-267
248 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
cape would recall the incident, but any steamer and any 
cape, or indeed any vessel and any coast, might do so 
without any further likeness between them. The 
thought of picture leads to framing, and that to hanging 
because such connexions are common in experience, 
That a photograph recalls its original is due, of course, 
to its resemblance to him; that is its one reason for 
existence. To muse on a man is to bring to mind what 
we know of him, especially if he is not a personal 
acquaintance ; for, indeed, what we know of his life is 
to us the man. When from one war the thoughts 
diverged to another war we have again a similar bond 
to that which connected the two pictures, but here deter- 
mined by personal interest. This striking life-experience 
recalled the wound which was its most intimate personal 
feature, and that led to a logical generalization which 
obviously expressed an opinion already formed. 
Nor is it only in private reverie that our thoughts 
are thus discursive. Consider the conversations of 
every-day life. How many topics are touched on in half 
an hour? What is their connexion with each other? 
Attention is continually losing control and yielding the 
teins to chance. How difficult, too, it is for many 
people to keep to the point in an argument! They are 
always going off at a tangent, till the end of theirremarks 
has nothing to do with the purpose with which they 
started, 
The train we have examined is, of course, an extremely 
simple example. Each reader can find more complex 
ones within his personal experience. That present 
experiences bring to the mind ideas of other things and 
events is the most common fact known to every one of 
us. It is but seldom that we attempt to discover why
-P-A-G-E-268
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 249 
just this thought was raised. When we do we often 
cannot succeed. For it is not always the most prominent 
thought that suggests the next idea. We have all 
known occasions when a train of thought or a conver- 
sation has been broken in upon by the sudden rush into 
consciousness of the idea of something quite different. 
It may, or it may not, be possible to trace the origin of 
such an interruption. If in a conversation with Jones 
I suddenly catch sight of Brown and remember that I 
have forgotten to post a letter I promised to post for 
him, my talk with Jones will be likely to be interrupted, 
and certainly my attention will be disturbed. But in 
many cases it is impossible to find a cause for the new 
thoughts. It may be something which only enters into 
marginal consciousness. 
“Music, when sweet voices die, 
Vibrates in the memory— 
Odours, when sweet violets sicken, 
Live within the sense they quicken.” ? 
Few can recall the scents of flowers as separate and dis- 
tinct remembrances. But that they do linger in the 
memory is proved by our power to recognize them. 
Nor do we as often pay specific attention to such impres- 
sions as receive them as part of the whole mental 
State at the moment. In the dim background of con- 
sciousness they exercise their influence, and if they enter 
there afresh they may bring back to our minds some 
remembrance of the past into which they had also 
entered. ‘A warm draught of air in midwinter, fanning 
the face suddenly and for an instant, charged with some 
exotic scent, may call up a person, incident, or locality, 
connected with a period of one’s life passed years apo 
1 Shelley.

in the South, or it may only create a mood corresponding 
to the sadness or joy of those days.” + 
The last consideration is very important. We have 
seen that the emotional side of life is closely connected 
with the mass of dim impressions in the background of 
consciousness. Some here, some there, of these have 
been similarly present in other moods of like tone. So 
it is inevitable that the thoughts and remembrances 
which come most readily to our minds when we are sad 
should have a mournful tone, while those which occur 
in cheerful moods should themselves be gay and bright. 
How spontaneously this comes about is illustrated by 
the sudden darkening of the present by the sight of a 
funeral; by the cessation of fun on entering a church; 
by the sobriety of mind the well-trained child feels on 
coming into school. 
Such suggestion of ideas by ideas, or of ideas by 
some dim present experience, is not an incidental thing 
in life. It is the texture of life itself. What is 
incidental is the control of the stream by deliberate pur- 
pose. It is only occasionally that we follow such # 
purpose in thought for any length of time. Mort 
commonly we intermix little spurts of attention with # 
good deal of mental drifting. Life is like a river 
Now in narrow bed it rushes on, calm and deep, in the 
irresistible current of inflexible purpose. Now it 
spreads out in shallows, with no perceptible onward 
motion though stirred by breaths of wind to gentle 
surface currents, flecked with the shifting light and shade 
of trivial and transient joys and griefs, here perchance 
bearing on its bosom dead leaves of regret, there broke 
twigs of abandoned ambitions.

This fact of suggestion is of the utmost importance in 
teaching, as in every other form of mental activity. 
Every part of a lesson is apt to start divergent trains. 
of ideas in the pupils’ minds. Often this becomes very 
apparent when they take part in an oral lesson by 
questions, remarks, or even answers. Absolutely to 
bar all such digressions checks thought altogether ; to 
follow them may end nobody knows where. The only 
alternative is to remember that as a divergent train 
started from the original train so it can be bent back to 
it again, and that without discouraging initiative by a 
blank prohibition. 
If we examine an attentive train of thought of our 
own we shall find that such a process is continuously 
going on. Connexion of ideas due to past experience 
is all we have to work with. If it fails our train of 
thought is brought to a standstill. Even the most suc- 
cessful thinker can recall many instances. The con- 
nexion he needs, the indispensable formula, the pertinent 
illustration, will not come. All his seeking is but 
“calling spirits from the vasty deep”. The inter- 
connexions which have been formed in his experience, 
mainly without either effort on his part to form them 
or consciousness that they were formed, for some reason 
temporarily fail him. We all know how fatigue thus 
makes thought difficult or even impossible; how deep 
sorrow not only prevents us from remembering past joys 
but hinders the calm intellectual dealing with subjects 
We are studying ; and how a joyous excitement exercises 
the opposite emotional effect but is an equally serious 
hindrance to thought. 
Systematic thought is, then, the controlling of a train 
of ideas which would flow on in some course if not
-P-A-G-E-271
252 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
controlled, but would not tend towards a predetermined 
end. It is this control which is properly called attention, 
Attention fulfils an executive function. We are inter. 
ested in some branch of knowledge or line of activity, 
and we desire to increase the knowledge or to attain 
some result through the activity. An opportunity 
presents itself for doing so, and we resolve to avail 
ourselves of it. But to fulfil the purpose we must work 
out the appropriate means ; that is, we must secure that 
they occupy our minds to the exclusion of divergent 
thoughts and suggestions. This concentration on the 
means, step by step, from the beginning of the process 
to the accomplishment, is the work of attention. 
But attention can only deal with the material brought 
to mind by that interconnexion of experiences which we 
have been considering. The presence of the interest 
gives.a tone to the whole consciousness, and operates in 
determining the kind of recall in a similar way to the 
emotional tone. Thus the ideas recalled are to a much 
greater extent than would otherwise be the case pertinent 
tothe matter in hand. So long as psychological interests 
are dominant I am not likely in writing this chapter, 
nor is the reader in reading it, to be troubled with mathe- 
matical or historical ideas. If the reader is keeping at 
eye on his own mind he will be conscious that those 
two words did immediately arouse such trains. It is to 
be hoped that he at once inhibited them ; that is, turned 
his attention from them. I made it easier for him to 
do so by prompting two incompatible trains. Had I 
mentioned only one of them the inhibition would have 
been more difficult in a mind in which there is a strong 
interest in mathematics or in history. 
But let us suppose the extraneous suggestions neg?
-P-A-G-E-272
  
  DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 253 
tived, and ask why it was possible to negative them. I 
can hardly flatter myself that in every case the explanation 
would be that the reader is generally more interested in 
my exposition of psychology than in mathematics or 
history. No, the reason cannot be found in comparative 
strength of general interests. It must be sought in 
present purpose. It is purpose which guides attention 
in its rejections and in its acceptances of the ideas 
offered to it by the automatic workings of conscious 
connexions. Purpose itself in the background is the 
touchstone by which every suggestion must be tested. 
It gives a general direction which must be followed 
though it does not immediately dictate each step. As 
the bark of thought glides down the stream of interest 
purpose holds the helm while attention plies the oars. 
Without purpose, therefore, we have no guide to 
attention. Here we doubtless have an explanation of 
much ineffectiveness in teaching. A class too often is 
not inspired by a purpose to master the matter put 
before it. Sometimes it starts with only the vaguest 
idea as to what the lesson is intended to teach. Then 
the only possible purpose is the abstract one of attending 
to the teacher, and this is quite other than attending to 
the subject. It may, and often does, only succeed in 
obtaining that spurious attention which satisfies itself in 
recognizing the ideas the teacher sets forth. The real 
state is that external determination of the course of 
thought without even an intelligent reconstruction of it 
in the mind of the hearers which has already been con- 
sidered. One cannot have real attention without its 
two essential conditions—interest and clear purpose.’” 
It plainly follows that attention is most effective and 
Most easy when both interest and purpose are strongest.
-P-A-G-E-273
254 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
Take as an example the writing of an important letter 
on a subject very near to one, and intended to bring 
about an object one has much at heart. One is not easily 
distracted ; one’s thoughts do not wander discursively 
but keep to the point, one selects and rejects expressions, 
all with the object of accomplishing the purpose. That 
is a simple case in which the act of attention is complete 
in itself. 
When a wider purpose is considered, as, for example, 
the writing of a book, which may extend over many 
months or even years, of necessity there is not such 
exclusive filling of the mind. Here the idea of the 
subject of the book is always in the background of 
consciousness and is ready to seize on anything, even in 
other trains of attention, which helps its development. 
If one reads history or poetry or fiction, passages which 
bear on one’s subject will at once recall it and emphasize 
their relation to it. Further, the purpose also is never 
really out of mind. It leads to certain lines of reading 
and of thought, to certain planning of time, to certain 
general arrangements of life to facilitate its accomplish- 
ment. To all these attention has to be given. Of 
course, they are only means, and the interest in them is 
indirect so far as the purpose of writing the book is 
concerned. In the actual periods of writing, interest 
and purpose dominate the train of ideas as in the case of 
writing the letter. The train itself is largely formed from 
the reading and thought which have previously been 
done under the dominance of the same purpose, but as 
it flows new connexions and relations occur which atten- 
tion judges by the test of purpose, and accepts, modifies, 
or rejects. 
To one who writes much there come times when the
-P-A-G-E-274
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 255 
impulsive strength of the purpose is but weakly felt. 
It may be that the work has been pursued so strenuously 
that there is some physical exhaustion, or it may be that 
new and conflicting interests and purposes have come 
into one’s life. Then the habit of working at the book 
at certain hours does much to supply the impetus and 
to set one down at one’s desk. Professional writers 
usually find that the only possible plan of securing the 
continuity of their work is to make a habit of writing 
between certain hours each day. 
In these cases the difficulty is in beginning. Soon 
after the start is made the interest and purpose which had 
grown faint revive and the work goes on energetically. 
Yet, as we know, it cannot go on indefinitely. After 
atime the power is felt to be diminishing, and if work 
be persisted in it is very unlikely to pass the test of our 
own criticism the next day. There is no need to enlarge 
on this. Everybody knows that real work induces 
fatigue, and that fatigue first spoils work, then inhibits 
it, Yet we do not become really conscious of fatigue 
just anywhere in our work, but only when we come in 
itto a natural halting-place. Then the fact that we are 
tired may suddenly overpower us. The explanation is 
not far to seek. Fatigue is a constituent in conscious- 
ness, and while our minds are full of the topic we are 
Working out, the fatigue, like emotional states in general, 
is thrust into the background. It does not belong to 
the main stream of consciousness, and in intensive atten- 
tion that is all we notice. But when the subordinate 
topic on which we have been engaged is finished there 
isa relaxation of mental tension; attention is over for 
the time, and the character of our consciousness as a 
whole is forced upon us.
-P-A-G-E-275
256 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
All these points are exemplified in working an 
examination paper. The examination is interesting 
because it is the means to a distinction which it is one’s 
purpose to win. ‘To write the appointed paper therefore 
becomes a subordinate purpose. Very likely if we were 
guided by present inclination that subordinate purpose 
would not be energetic enough to set us down at the 
desk in the examination hall at the time appointed. We 
accept that determination as part of the purpose to pass 
the examination, and we accept it so fully that we do 
present ourselves even if somewhat unfit physically. At 
the end of each paper there is a cessation of attention 
to that subject, and possibly a feeling of fatigue. For 
the next paper the whole mental process has to start 
afresh. Further, there are subordinate lapses of atten- 
tion at the end of each answer, for again a special topic 
has been dealt with as far as we propose then to deal with 
it. But at the earlier of these breaks, at any rate if we 
are in good health, we do not feel fatigue; though 
towards the end of a long examination fatigue is felt 
earlier in each paper than it was at the beginning. 
When one considers how one answers a question one 
finds that it takes a little time to call up the desired ideas 
and to send the attention along on the new track. Our 
experience, therefore, tells us that the effectiveness of an 
attentive process rapidly increases at the start, then goes 
on with undiminished vigour for a time, then falls of 
rapidly as fatigue comes on; and that a well-formed 
habit is of the utmost service both in taking up an accus 
tomed task and in keeping to it for the allotted time. 
All these characteristics of attention are, of course, 
found in children. The school habit makes it easy of 
difficult for them to be attentive. In schools one ofteo
-P-A-G-E-276
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 257 
finds a class attentive and industrious with one teacher 
and quite otherwise with another teacher. The children 
are the same; both teacher and subject are different. 
In them one must seek the explanation, and it would 
be wise to look first at the teacher. For children, 
especially young children, are not very fastidious as to 
what they attend to, and easily catch an enthusiasm from 
a strong and sympathetic teacher. They become 
interested by contagion. With at least equal facility 
are they infected by a teacher’s slackness. The older 
they get the less this is operative, but it always has some 
effect in youth, and frequently in adult life. 
The natural cessation of attention at the end of a topic 
should always be regarded in the planning of lessons. 
Lessons which simply leave off anywhere when the clock 
strikes ignore an unalterable law of mental life. A little 
ehsticity in time-tables is consequently a great aid to 
effective teaching. The oncoming of fatigue should be 
carefully watched. But at present the tendency is rather 
the other way. Lessons are so short that the scholars 
are not called upon to concentrate their attention for the 
greatest length of time possible to them without over- 
Pressure. That is to say, they are not trained in per- 
sistence and perseverance. The inordinate number of 
short lessons which most classes receive every day is a 
bad intellectual training both positively and negatively. 
It is bad positively, as it cultivates that volatile super- 
fciality which is a sign of an unregulated and undis- 
tiplined mind ; it is bad negatively, as it makes impossible 
the self-discipline without which strength of purpose is 
impossible. Concentration in successive periods on 
diferent proups of subjects would assuredly give a better 
training of capacity.

-P-A-G-E-277
258 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
In anxiety to guard against undue fatigue, however, 
one must not mistake boredom for it. Boredom isa 
state in which healthy children should not naturally be, 
but it isa very common one in schools nevertheless. The 
chief reason is that the scholars do not see the value of 
their lessons, and that this is not compensated by 
enthusiasm in their teacher. Indeed, it would be almost 
a miracle if an intelligent teacher did become enthusiastic 
over much that it is customary to teach in school. Bore 
dom is the natural attendant of having to do light work 
without interest. If the work be heavy we have not 
boredom but drudgery, soon leading to fatigue. This 
English boys, at any rate, may usually be trusted to 
avoid in their lessons. 
Boredom may also arise in other ways. A scholar 
may be interested in the subject and have the purpose 
of attending to the lesson, but this purpose may be 
balked by the teaching. It may be too quick, so that 
he is called upon to pass on to a new idea before he has 
clearly grasped the present one; or it may be too slow, 
so that his mind is continually left unoccupied; or it 
may be confused and obscure. In each case the result 
is either boredom while the pupil is still following, of 
the dropping of the purpose and a mental rambling to 
more interesting subjects. Most people who have 
listened to lectures or to sermons, or who have read 
books, will be able to find examples in personal expeti 
ence of all these varieties of effects on mental activity of 
faulty presentation of matter which is itself of interest. 
Perhaps nothing is more fatal to the cultivation of 4 
habit of attention among children than the well-meatt 
but mistaken custom of many teachers of incessatt 
talking. How far the idea that their scholars should
-P-A-G-E-278
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 259 
attend zo them, instead of attend to the subject with . 
them, is at the bottom of this practice it is impossible to 
say. But a false conception of the nature of attention 
is certainly operative as well. However it originates 
its results are disastrous. The pupils are never set to 
work out a train of thought—to govern and direct their 
own ideas in reference toa determined end. Theteacher 
fixes the end, and often keeps it an inviolable secret 
locked up in his own breast. That is the first fatal error, 
and it leads to all the others. The scholars having 
nothing to work towards are simply taken on inch by 
inch by questions just looking forward that inch. They 
may begin at last to guess the direction in which they are 
going, but few take the trouble to do so. Why should 
they? That is the teacher’s affair, as every lesson im- 
presses on them. The result is that if any child learns 
to think it is in spite of his school work. The essence 
of thought is self-direction of ideas. That cannot be 
cultivated by carefully preventing the children from ever 
having the direction of a train of thinking in their own 
hands. No doubt, teachers are afraid that they would 
hot cover so much ground unless they thus kept their 
scholars in leading-strings. They do not ask themselves 
the very pertinent question—What does that matter? 
Surely a boy or girl who can think, and who has learnt 
by thinking all that has been learnt, is better than one 
who has been personally conducted through wider tracts 
of knowledge, but who has sought and found nothing on 
the way, 
The case when attention is working in the realm of 
adirect purpose which grows out of the means, and in 
which the interest is immediate, is the normal one. Then 
the energy of the whole self goes out on a path which
-P-A-G-E-279
260 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
directly leads to a fuller and better self. The whok 
activity rather makes us more than brings us more; so 
that every step in advance is itself a personal advantage. 
Throughout there is a feeling of self-satisfaction and 
enlargement of power. Then indeed the will and the 
desires are unified, and the greatest energy of which we 
are capable is thrown into the whole process. It is 
different when the purpose is only artificially connected 
with the means by which it must be attained. Then 
each advance is valued only as an advance; it has no 
worth in itself. If we stopped before reaching the end 
we should be none the better, whereas in the former case 
no matter where we stopped we should have gained part, 
though not all, of what we were seeking. Take as an 
example the learning of a foreign language. If our 
purpose be really to know the language every advance 
partly fulfils that purpose. But if it be only to pass an 
examination in the language then if we cease to study it 
at a stage obviously beneath that required by the exam 
nation we can but judge our labour as lost and our time 
as thrown away. By ignoring the language in the future 
we bring our minds as soon as possible to the state they 
would have been in with respect to it had we nevet 
started learning it. 
It has already been said that we cannot get through 
life without many such indirect purposes. Happy 
indeed are they whose main occupation is not one of 
them. According to their strength such purposs 
prompt attention. Many boys and girls will work 
devotedly to win a prize, although the subject worked 
at has no special interest for them. Many a man has 
made a fortune by assiduous attention to an occupation 
to which in his heart he has a strong aversion. All of
-P-A-G-E-280
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 261 
us have duties of which the fulfilment calls for the 
putting on one side of direct interests. 
That we can and do give attention to parts of our 
work which in themselves have no attraction for us no 
teacher is likely to deny. The marking of examination 
papers is not a very delightful occupation even when we 
have the interest of discovering the effect of our own 
teaching, and when the papers are those of strangers 
even this bond of direct interest is absent. True, there 
are occasional bright spots when a particularly engaging 
‘howler? appears—as when a small boy once translated 
for me ‘humanum est errare? by ‘Humanity is a mis- 
take’ But such reliefs are rare, and no one would 
undertake to mark several hundred papers for the joy of 
finding a few. Still less possibility is there of direct 
interest in filling up the numerous ‘Forms’ which 
delight the official soul. These take one away from 
one’s real work of education, and therefore interfere with 
one’s greatest legitimate interest. Nor is there usually 
the consolation of believing that the records called for 
tither are or ever can be of the smallest service to educa- 
tion. Yet one does such work, and one does it care- 
fully. That is, one really attends to it, simply because 
it is part of the routine work which is inseparable from 
the general work of teaching. We like teaching, and 
we take the rough with the smooth, convinced that every 
calling has its own collateral drawbacks. 
In such matters it is not adequate to say that we do 
violence to our interests. Life is never so simple that 
only one interest at a time is alive in it. Continually we 
have to inhibit desires and tendencies because a wider 
purpose calls us. In these cases we certainly inhibit 
actions which, taken by themselves, we should find agree-
-P-A-G-E-281
262 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
able. But we do so because a stronger interest calls us 
another way. True, this interest is indirect, but it is 
none the less real. Without it the purpose cannot be 
attained, and with that attainment we have identified our 
whole being. We may wish that the available means 
were different, but we recognize that they are not, and 
so we throw ourselves into them. No doubt, when the 
purpose is weak or of small importance our energy in 
attending to the means is less. That is only an example 
of the general rule that we put forth the strength we 
deem necessary, but no more, whether that strength be 
bodily or mental. But when the purpose is strong our 
indirect interest in the means is also strong, and out 
attention is then fully concentrated. Ranke incidentally 
givesan admirable example. Atter describing the devo- 
tion to State affairs of Queen Christina of Sweden he 
remarks: “It was not inclination for business which 
precipitated her into it with such ardour ; she was urged 
on by ambition and by a sense of her sovereign power 
and dignity—but she found no pleasure in it.”? 
No doubt when the means give pleasure, or pain, ia 
themselves, when they yield a subordinate emotional 
interest, it is easier to maintain attention. Then out 
mental grip of the subject is reinforced by the subject’s 
grip of us. But then there is usually a direct intellectul 
interest as well as an indirect. Then the subjectis studied 
for its own sake as well as for the external purpose. 
The only means of developing true attention to4 
pursuit not in itself interesting is to make it a means to3 
purpose felt to be of value. The more toil is required 
the greater that felt value must be. But to try to deck 
the undesired means with fruits and flowers to makt

a
-P-A-G-E-282
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 263 
them attractive is quite ineffectual. The fruits and 
flowers are seized, that which they decked is rejected. 
In this matter of indirect interest the force of habitua- 
tion is of particular worth. That a child should think 
of certain subjects in school, that he should try to direct 
his thoughts in certain well-marked paths, that all his 
surroundings suggest work by their constant association 
with work, that the presence and acts of the teacher 
strengthen the suggestion, that the parents desire him to 
work, that all his class-mates are similarly affected and 
all adopt the attitude proper to school—all these and 
many similar small influences, not thought but felt, put 
the child’s mind in the proper attitude of preparedness 
and readiness to attend to what the lessons may put 
before him. The manner in which he is required or 
encouraged to learn influences, as has been said, the kind 
and amount of attention he puts forth. That also is habit. 
Among habits helpful to attention in school is cer- 
tainly that of general bodily quiescence. A pupil con- 
stantly moving about is a distraction to his class-mates 
if not to himself. Too often, however, this outward 
help is taken by teachers as the essential mark of atten- 
tion, and much insistence is placed on perfect immobility. 
The result is that inhibition of spontaneous movements 
becomes the children’s purpose. So attention is to some 
extent withdrawn from the lesson. Learning ceases to 
be the main object. Moreover, the concentration of 
attention on the machinery of movement so innervates 
that machinery that the tendency to movement is in- 
creased. ‘‘In illustration... we may compare the atten- 
tion repeated from time to time in holding a glass of 
water in the hands for a short period: if we pay 4 
moderate amount of attention we can hold the glass when
-P-A-G-E-283
264 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
it is almost full, but if we pay too much attention to our 
hands the tone of the muscles becomes altered, and the 
water runs over. None feel so restless as those who try 
to stand still.’+ Many children are naturally restless, 
and their movements by no means imply idleness or 
wandering of attention. Nor is immobility in the case 
of children, especially those naturally phlegmatic, incom- 
patible with absolute absence of attention: the mind 
may be wandering far in the realms of fancy, or may beas 
near perfect immobility as is the body. A wise teacher 
will judge the attention of his pupils by very different 
signs—by their mental alertness, not by their bodily 
repose. The absence of the latter is to be regretted only 
when its opposite becomes a hindrance to the former. 
Attention is made difficult to all not only by poor 
health or temporary bodily derangement but by outside 
distractions. Young children taken into an unaccus 
tomed room to be taught are attracted by the surround- 
ings because of their novelty. They have little power 
of concentrating attention, and until they have satisfied 
their curiosity it is not of much use to expect the exercise 
of even that power. As age increases the distraction has 
to be more pronounced to draw our minds away from 
the line of interest. Of course, every such case is 4 
struggle between attraction from without and attention 
from within. The issue depends partly on strength of 
present interest, but a great deal more on cultivated 
power of inhibition. One who has formed the habit can 
work amid surroundings that would render concentration 
impossible to another who might yet be able to attend 
equally well were he free from distractions. The differ- 
ence, however, is in the nervous organization as well as 
1R, Verdon, Article on ‘ Forgetfulness’ in Mind, vol. ii, p. 450»
-P-A-G-E-284
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 265 
in past experiences: some can cultivate the habit more 
successfully than others. 
Let us ask what happens when a distraction breaks in, 
Suppose one is answering an examination paper—a case 
in which the limitation of time makes it especially impor- 
tant that all of it should be devoted to the work in hand. 
The insistent sound of a gramophone in the street breaks 
on the ear. There are surely three possibilities. One 
may yield oneself to the distraction, and lose one’s grip 
of the examination work. Attention to the one thing 
has been succeeded by absorption in the other without 
any attempt to inhibit the change. This may involve so 
much attention to the gramophone as is needed to follow 
the tune, but that is only ancillary to the enjoyment. . In 
the second place, the gramophone may raise a new train 
of ideas, as, for instance, the idea of a friend who delights 
in such strains, and who has some business relations with 
one; then one may begin thinking about that business. 
In this case attention to the examination has been suc- 
ceeded by attention to another subject suggested by the 
distraction: again the change has taken place without 
inhibition. ‘Thirdly, one may keep in mind the import- 
ance of the examination, remember the limitation of 
time, and thus strengthen the original purpose, so that 
one is able to inhibit the giving of the mind to the 
disturbance. Then attention is kept on the original 
subject. One cannot exclude the sound, but one arrests 
every incipient trend of the thoughts in that direction. 
One puts all the more effort into answering the questions, 
and as one concentrates one’s thoughts, more and more 
ideas cognate to the work in hand rush into consciousness 
and make the task easier. This is shown to be so by the 
fact of common experience that the more we are engrossed
-P-A-G-E-285
266 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
in an answer the easier is this inhibition. If we feel that 
we are really writing round the subject, and that the 
ideas we are expressing are of little worth, or if we are 
between two answers or just beginning a new one, then 
inhibition is more difficult. 
But distractions come not only from without. We 
all know what it is to wander in thought. Sometimes 
when reading a book one only discovers that one has 
reached the bottom of a page by the nearly automatic 
action of turning over, and one wonders what the page 
has been about. Though one’s eyes have followed the 
words one’s thoughts have gone off on another track. 
The fact that attention always works with connexions of 
experiences already formed, and largely outside our con- 
trol, makes it easy to understand this. Of course, it 
only occurs when the purpose has for the time but litte 
strength. Yet that is likely to happen, because, as we 
have seen, the purpose which directs a train of thought 
is always in the background. It is, I believe, common 
experience that we are more liable thus to lose our way in 
following another’s thoughts than in working out out 
own ; and least likely of all to do so when the working 
out of our own thoughts is attended by some bodily 
activity, such as noting down our ideas as they come to 
us. Great, too, is the influence of habit. A person 
who drills and disciplines himself can do much to form 
and strengthen the habit of concentration. If he find 
that reading without note-taking means wandering 
thoughts he will be wise to take notes. If he can keep 
his own thoughts fixed best when he jots them down he 
will be foolish to omit that help. It is, after all, a matter 
of self-control. If we cannot become perfect we can at 
least improve.
-P-A-G-E-286
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 267 
To sum up our results. Attention is occasional, not 
constant, in life. With some men and women it plays 
an important part; with others a comparatively small 
one. It is indispensable to the carrying out of purpose, 
immediate or remote. A purpose which remains in idea, 
but to the attainment of which attention is never bent, 
isa mere delusion and dream. Attention guides all 
reasoned conduct. It is essentially intellectual in its 
working, but it takes for its objects not only thoughts 
and lines of reasoning but things and modes of dealing 
with them. Thought deals primarily with the world 
and only secondarily with itself. Attention cannot be 
separated from interest or from purpose. But the 
interest may be indirect, and then greater strength of 
purpose is needed to make possible as thorough a con- 
centration of attention as when the interest is direct. 
The effectiveness of attention and the power of concen- 
tration are decreased by ill health and by outward 
distractions. Attention to a topic fails when the topic 
is exhausted, when fatigue becomes pronounced, when 
boredom results from the mode of presentation. 
When attention is thus looked at it becomes plain 
that power of attention is a matter of gradual growth, 
and that it grows within the development of purpose. 
It is further obvious that such development must be 
helped by guidance and discipline if it is to attain its full 
stature. Though some children are naturally of stronger 
will than others yet all are dominated by their surround- 
ings, and, without training and restraint their strength 
of will is likely to show itself only in asserting a right 
to the most pleasant things immediately at hand. Every 
child needs help in the passage from absorption to atten- 
tion. Of course, it is not meant that absorption ceases
-P-A-G-E-287
268 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
It is operative throughout life, for life is not all work 
and struggle. But some of it is; and he who cannot 
disregard at need the attractions of his surroundings 
will make a poor thing of life. The transition is made 
through the incitement of purposes—by suggestion, by 
example, by habitude—adapted to the stage of mental 
development the child has reached. 
It may, then, fairly be said that the essential task of 
education is to promote the purposive element in life. 
The baby has it not at all. The young child shows its 
beginnings. It has desires which prompt action, but it 
has no persistence. It is drawn away continually from 
one element in its surroundings to another. It has no 
plans beyond the immediate present. As intelligence 
develops, knowledge increases, and desires widen, the 
future is more and more constructed in imagination. In 
such construction the educator can play an important 
part. So actions are related to each other in a chain 
reaching to a foreseen and wished-for end. The process 
is continuous. Its outward expression is in the relation 
of acts to each other ; in other words, in the organization 
of life round purpose: its inward force is the increasing 
meaning life is felt to possess. 
Though the exposition of attention in the preceding 
pages appears to me to be in harmony with the facts of 
mental life and in accordance with ordinary thought and 
speech, yet I must confess that it differs somewhat widely 
from that current in most present-day writings on psycho- 
logy. It, therefore, seems advisable to state briefly my 
reasons for rejecting the latter view. The most funds- 
mental is that the doctrine treats attention as a form of 
cognition instead of as volition. It is affiliated with 
the hypothesis that all mental life is built up from sensi
-P-A-G-E-288
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 269 
tions. From this it logically follows that sensation and 
attention are but different names for the same thing. 
This was explicitly stated by Condillac, probably the 
most philosophical thinker of that school: ‘‘ As soon as 
Ifix my eyes upon an object the mass of sensations which 
I receive from it is the very attention which I give to 
it”! Though such an identification is not usual now, 
yet when attention is regarded as the reflex of conscious- 
ness on whatever is presented to it, it is made just as 
much the slave of its surroundings as in Condillac’s more 
direct statement. 
It necessarily follows that whenever we are aware of 
anything we are held to be attentive to it in some degree. 
This usage, therefore, extends the application of the 
term attention ‘‘so as to include what we ordinarily call 
inattention’? ‘This is obviously inconvenient. There 
isno need for another term to designate what we already 
know as awareness or consciousness. But there is need 
for a distinction in terminology between awareness due 
to our own efforts and awareness in the sense of passive 
reception and recognition of what comes into our minds 
Without any controlling effort on our part. The use of 
‘attention’ in common speech does broadly recognize 
that distinction, in that it regards attention as self- 
directed thought. 
That concentration of attention on any object of 
thought does make it more distinct and prominent is 
certain. But to regard vividness in consciousness as a 
proof of attention is just as much to confuse result with 
origin as is the inclusion under imitation of all acts which

oth ed. p. 41 (b).
-P-A-G-E-289
270 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
resemble those of other people, without consideration 
of the motive which led to them. ‘‘ All attention in- 
creases vividness” cannot be converted to ‘‘ All vividness 
is due to attention.” Anyone who has suffered froma 
tooth-ache when writing an examination paper is aware 
that the tooth-ache was vivid enough all the time his 
attention was engaged with his answers. The difference 
between the two mental attitudes is surely clear, and it 
is equally evident which application of the term ‘atten- 
tion? agrees with ordinary usage. 
It is because the common meaning of attention will 
remain in mind that the popular classification of ‘kinds 
of attention” into Involuntary, Non-voluntary or Spon- 
taneous, and Voluntary or Volitional, strikes one as so 
remarkable. If in each case we substitute ‘awareness’ 
for ‘attention’ we see what ismeant. For wecan bemade 
aware of things against our will—as of a tooth-ache. 
Or we may be aware of pleasant things which are present 
to our senses, or of agreeable thoughts which come into 
our minds without any effort on our part—that we have 
seen in absorption and in reverie. Or, lastly, we may 
have to put forth effort to get clear and vivid in our minds 
something of which we desire to be more fully conscious. 
In ordinary speech only the last of these would be called 
attention. To speak of ‘involuntary attention’ seemsa 
contradiction in terms, and, indeed, is so if ‘attention’ 
mean anything more than awareness. 
We have already examined, in the example of the 
distraction of a gramophone, what may happen to the 
course of thought when something is presented to 
consciousness against our will. There may be attention 
from the distraction, or there may be absorption init with 
subordinate attention to it, or there may be attention to 
|
-P-A-G-E-290
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY 271 
something suggested by it. But none of these is un- 
willing attention #0 it. If we attend at all to it, or to 
something suggested by it, we do so willingly ; if we 
inhibit attention from it we evidently do not attend w it. 
Under ‘non-voluntary attention? is included not only 
absorption, in which attention is absent or is at its mini- 
mum and then only instrumental, but also that full and 
perfect attention in which the whole energy goes out in 
accomplishment of purpose through means in themselves 
directly interesting because each step partly fulfils the 
purpose. To speak of this most complete and powerful 
outpouring of our personal energy as ‘non-voluntary’ 
isa strange and misleading use of terms. When our 
whole will is engaged in bringing before us certain ideas, 
how can it be said that the appearance of those ideas in 
consciousness is independent of our will? Interest, we 
are told, explains the mystery: when we are interested 
mental activity is spontaneous. That is an ambiguous 
tem. It may mean that the activity is an instinctive 
impulse not controlled by purpose ; or it may mean that 
it arises and flows on without our recognizing how, when 
it may be due to habitude or to unnoticed impressions ; 
or it may mean that it is an activity which causes pleasure 
or is not checked by pain. In one or other of these 
senses the flow of ideas which is constant in mind may, 
if it be so desired, be called spontaneous. But if that 
be made equivalent to attention then it would seem that 
consciousness of such uncontrolled streams of ideas as 
pass before us in reverie is attention, for to introduce 
direction of the stream is surely to make it voluntary. 
This makes ‘non-voluntary attention’ include inatten- 
tion in the usual acceptation of that term, and so classes 
together two states essentially antithetical.
-P-A-G-E-291
272 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
Indeed, this view of attention divorces it from pur. 
pose. It seems to imply that the will is a power external 
to the act of attention and independent of it, so that it 
can bring pressure to bear upon it. This comes out very 
clearly in the current exposition of what is called 
‘voluntary? or ‘volitional? attention, which means 
bringing an obscure thought or impression to greater 
clearness in consciousness by our own action. Then we 
are told we exercise a direct act of will to attend. Doubt- 
less we can decide to attend to a definite topic. Doubt- 
less also, it is difficult at times to do so ; that is matter of 
universal experience and has already been considered. 
Our energy is not a. constant quantity, and all things do 
not attract usequally. So it is harder to concentrate our 
thoughts at one time than at another, and that fora 
variety of reasons, some in ourselves, some in the objects 
to which we attend, and some in the conditions undet 
which the attention is given. Doubtless, too, this isa 
voluntary activity. But it differs from that willing 
attention which is classed under ‘non-voluntary’, 
not by the presence or absence of will, but by the pre- 
sence or absence of obstacles to be overcome. We att 
more conscious of the effort we make, because it is but 
imperfectly successful, and meets with obstacles, and 
always the overcoming of an obstacle makes very plain 
the effort we are putting forth—indeed, often demands 
an increase in that effort—because it seems to meet and 
overcome an effort exerted in opposition to us. Stil, 
no one would say that if a door sticks when we go to 
open it the opening is a voluntary act but if it yields 
easily we open it non-voluntarily. In each case the act 
is voluntary because it is done deliberately to accomplish 
a set purpose. It is exactly the same with the mental
-P-A-G-E-292
DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY = 273 
activity of attending. ‘The opposition makes our effort 
more explicit, but does not change that relation to pur- 
pose which distinguishes the voluntary from that which 
isnot voluntary. It is not that we put forth two efforts: 
one to make ourselves attend, the other in the actual 
attending. All the effort is in the latter. Weare aware 
of it, but the awareness is not a second effort. We 
do not—even if we could—divide our effort into. two 
streams, one of which compels the other. 
We are further told, and that with emphasis, that 
“there is no such thing as voluntary attention sustained 
for more than a few seconds at a time. What is called 
sustained voluntary attention is a repetition of successive 
efforts which bring back the topic to the mind.”? I can 
only say that if it be so, in my own case I am not generally 
conscious of these very ineffective efforts. One can 
Work at a distasteful task for a long time without any 
such continual use of the mental lash. The habitude of 
doing what has to be done keeps many a clerk attentive 
for hours to an occupation which in itself can hardly be of 
engrossing interest. If his attention ebbs and flows 
every second or two it does not affect his work, and he is 
hot conscious of it. Attention regarded as the putting 
forth of effort may, of course, not always be the same 
amount of effort. But that is so whatever the topic or 
work attended to may be. That experiment may show 
thythm of ebb and flow in clearness of cognition is not 
to the point when we are considering the question of the 
possible duration of sustained effort at a disagreeable 
task, 
The classification thus seems open to attack even when 
interpreted as referring to modes of becoming aware, 
1James : Principles of Psychology, vol. i. p. 420. 
Ww s
-P-A-G-E-293
274 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
for several such modes are included under one head. To | 
regard it as a classification of modes of voluntary mental 
activity leads to inextricable confusion. The educational 
applications made of the doctrine certainly show such 
confusion. The chief is that as ‘voluntary attention’ 
is only possible to adults for a few seconds at a time itis 
practically impossible to children altogether. Therefore 
the teacher’s aim is to secure ‘non-voluntary attention’. 
That, as has been said, includes both real attention and 
absorption. But, as the emphasis is placed on present 
interest, in practice it is too often identified with the 
latter. So entertainment and amusement take the place 
of purpose in lessons. Indeed, appeal cannot consistently 
be made to purpose, for to seek a purpose can never bea 
non-voluntary proceeding. Thus children are trained to 
live for the gratification of the moment, but they are not 
trained to strenuous and persevering effort. The doc 
trine which interprets attention as mode of becoming 
aware is transferred to the self-directed activity which 
ordinary speech calls attention. So, because the doctrine 
says ‘voluntary? attention is a very infrequent thing in 
life, effort is made a very infrequent thing in education. 
Education to be real must work with a doctrine of 
attention which takes account of the most characteristic 
of all human activities—the subordination of the preseat 
to an esteemed good in the future.

CHAPTER IX 
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 
“Live and learn” says the proverb, expressing with the 
greatest possible brevity a truth which has been abun- 
dantly manifest thgoughout the foregoing discussions. 
Liying is learning, and we are assured that even fools 
profit by the lessons of experience. In the most funda- 
mental matters of life a man devoid of knowledge is an 
impossibility, and when we speak of ‘an unlearned man’? 
we do so in an artificial and a conventional sense. 
All informal learning by experience is, in the fullest 
sense, real. It is absorbed into the very texture of life 
and has the most direct bearing on its needs, out of 
which, indeed, it arises. One aspect of the life of every 
one is 
“Getting increase of knowledge, since he learns 
Because he lives, which is to be a man, 
Set to instruct himself by his past self: 
First, like the brute, obliged by facts to learn, 
Next, as man may, obliged by his own mind, 
Bent, habit, nature, knowledge turned to law.” ! 
This informal learning which goes on throughout life 
isnot acquired by the unaided efforts of the individual. 
Those efforts are guided and helped by the instinctive 
assimilation and deliberate imitation of the doings of 
1Browning: 4 Death in the Desert,
-P-A-G-E-295
276 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
those around us. Further, learning to talk is not only 
a new form of physical activity, or even of expression of 
thought or wish ; it is also of necessity a means of gather- 
ing both information and guidance from others. The 
whole forms one stream of experience continually being 
enriched by new activities, new enjoyments, new desires, 
new thoughts. 
_ From the speech of others a child learns in two chief 
ways. ‘That speech may direct and guide his activities 
so that what he does leads him to new experiences, ot it 
may give him information about what he does not him- 
self experience. It thus enters into the two ultimate 
modes of acquiring knowledge. It will make for clear- 
ness if we consider these separately. 
It will be obvious to all that the former is primordial, 
for no words can convey information except in so far as 
they are filled with meaning derived from direct personal 
experience. The neglect of this truth has long been the 
besetting sin of schools. ‘Too often they have adopted 
the position of Mephistopheles—

On words ’tis excellent believing ;

On the other hand such a reaction as would lead tc 
neglect of communication as a means of knowledge, and 
so would limit, as far as it is possible, each individual to 
his own experience, and even in that minimize the help 
given by the guidance of others, is equally to be depre- 
cated. All human advance is a co-operative movement 
in which the discoveries of each are available for all. To 
attempt to put back each child into the position as 
regards learning he must of necessity have occupied had 
human knowledge never grown to what it is, is to fly in 
the face of nature, not to take it for a guide. Nature 
itself prompts us to make use of others, for human 
nature is essentially social. 
The fine art of instruction is to attain the due balance 
between direct personal experience and communication 
of the knowledge attained by others, to secure that these 
not only balance but amalgamate, and to provide. that 
the resultant knowledge is as copious and effective as 
possible, 
With the advance of civilization the demand for 
wisely determined learning becomes more and more 
pressing. The more complex is the life to be led the 
greater need is there for knowledge to meet its various 
calls effectively. Not that knowledge alone isdemanded. 
Efficient life is a matter of purpose and perseverance as 
well as of knowledge and intelligence. Yet these are 
not isolated in life and cannot be isolated in a true educa- 
tion. Our purposes and desires are limited by our 
knowledge, and our perseverance is largely the outcome 
of the manner of our learning. Because, then, educa- 
tion seeks efficiency in life as a whole, one of its most 
difficult practical problems is always the determination 
of what the young shall be required to learn. Noor is it
-P-A-G-E-297
. 278 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
one to which a general answer can be given. So longas 
we keep to the abstract, and really, though perhaps un- 
consciously, have in view the community as a whole, 
good deal may be said for almost any subject. For 
evidently in a civilized community there is a place for 
every kind of knowledge which mankind has yet 
attained. Yet it is obvious that no one can learn every- 
thing that is known. 
The question must, indeed, be approached quite 
differently—from the point of view of the pupils really 
concerned, whose efficiency or inefficiency will be largely 
determined by the answer. Only by a careful considers 
tion of the relative claims of various forms of experience 
to emphasis in the training of particular classes can 
even an approximately correct practical solution be 
attained. 
Nor does a valid answer long remain valid. The. 
needs of each generation differ from those of its pre 
decessors, and its own will not be identical with those of 
its successors. Were there not continual evolution of 
knowledge and of conditions of life this would make the 
task of education a hopeless one. As it is, the two 
opposite mistakes of a slavish adherence to tradition and 
a revolutionary disregard of the work of the past have 
to be avoided. The former is most often made by the 
school, the latter by enthusiastic and theoretical advocates 
of change. 
The real problem for education is so to arrange those 
experiences of each child which are under its direction, 
and so to select the knowledge which shall be imparted by 
communication, that the individual life may be made 
efficient as possible. Time and human energy are both 
too valuable to be wasted in learning what certainly, of
-P-A-G-E-298
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE. 279 
even probably, can add neither to the joy nor to th 
usefulness of life. . 
Efficiency, it need hardly be said, should not be inter- 
preted narrowly. Too often this error has been made, 
and men have shown a lamentable tendency to limit 
capacity to one special sphere. At one time the effici- 
ency sought was confined to facility and ingenuity in 
empty disquisitions of formal logic, at another to mastery 
of the Latin language, at another to dialectical skill in 
controversial theology, and often in our own materialistic 
times to commercial or industrial efficiency. None of 
these is adequate, because none takes account of the chief 
occupation of each one of us—to be a man or a woman. 
Efficiency is co-extensive with living, and in the normal 
life it grows in width as well as in depth. This is t 
that efficiency is not something we possess but sometismy, 
weare. It is the product of our original capacities and 
of the whole of our experience. It is continually de- 
veloping, for it is continually being nourished. But 
only when acquirement is taken up into capacity does it 
develop efficiency. Learning which does not increase 
the power to deal with some of the calls of life—whether 
moral, mental, aesthetic, physical, or what not—does not 
add to efficiency, and is, therefore, worthless. 
It is evident, then, that the method of learning is as 
important a factor in true education as is the matter 
which is learnt. 
“What good of giving knowledge if, because 
©’ the manner of the gift, its profit fail?”} 
The fact that learning is guided by teaching tends to 
obscure in practice the truth that it is a living, assimila- 
1Browning: 4 Death in the Desert.
-P-A-G-E-299
280 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
tive, process on the part of the taught, and one in which 
the teacher can only provide nutriment and inducement. 
The power the young have of learning by rote state- 
ments they do not realize or understand still further 
obscures the fact that from many of their lessons they 
gain no real knowledge. The true learning which is 
increase of efficiency is always the result of real seeking 
—the satisfaction of an inner desire, not the imposition 
from without of an obnoxious burden. True teaching 
stimulates such seeking in ways adapted to the require- 
ments of the pupils. 
“So, minds at first must be spoon-fed with truth: 
When they can eat, babe’s nurture is withdrawn. 
I fed the babe whether it would or no: 
I bid the boy or feed himself or starve.” } 
Prompting is necessary because we are naturally 
satisfied to know our experience just so far as it serves 
our present needs. A child’s knowledge looks to us 
very fragmentary, trivial, and ineffective. As a wholeit 
by no means so appears to him: did it do so his life must 
be one of unsatisfied longing, and this is certainly not 
the characteristic of childhood. We may bring the 
need for external stimulus home to ourselves yet 
more directly by considering how very incomplete 
and imperfect—probably also inaccurate—is our own 
knowledge of many things with which we are quite 
familiar. My own knowledge of the mode in which the 
electric current moves a tram-car is assuredly of this 
nature. Yet I use the cars constantly without the 
slightest feeling of regret for the inadequacy of my 
knowledge or of desire to extend it. All of us can find 
1 Browning : 4 Death in the Desert.
-P-A-G-E-300
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 28: 
an indefinitely large number of such cases. We feel our 
defects only when in some way we are called upon:to do. 
something which those defects hinder us from doing. 
The call may be mental or it may be physical, When it 
comes and is accepted it leads to effort to increase know- 
ledge in that respect. But many of the calls made upon 
each one of us by our surroundings are disregarded. 
Indeed, this must be so, as they do not always come singly. 
The call of the tram-car to me to understand it is ignored 
because other and incompatible calls seem more impera- 
tive. Iam more interested in my fellows than in tram- 
cars, and they challenge me abundantly to mental 
activity. 
The calls to which we respond are those which interest 
us; that is, they come from things which we regard as 
of value for us. ‘The world of knowledge we make for 
ourselves is not a kind of picture on which we placidly 
fx our gaze, but is a system of values—a mass of calls to 
which we find satisfaction in responding. So each one 
of us makes his world by-his own activity : it is he who: 
gives relative value to this or that kind of experience, 
and the mass of experiences, direct and indirect, are his 
world, and, in a sense, are himself, for the world of each 
one of us is the whole system of his own known and 
evaluated experience. 
Looked at in this way it is seen that teaching is 
stimulus and direction, and that learning is enrichment 
of life which can only be attained by response to calls 
which are felt to be worth meeting. The function of 
teaching is to increase the number of these calls and to 
systematize them, and that in such a way that they may 
appear in life as a demand of the inner spirit and not 
only or mainly as a requirement of an outer authority.
-P-A-G-E-301
282 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
In this way teaching both follows and guides the 
pupils natural development. It follows it, because it is 
quite hopeless to attempt to make a child feel a call to 
learn which does not arise easily within his range of 
interests. It guides it, because by its provision of such 
calls it causes those interests to expand and to deepen 
in a way they would not do if left to themselves. 
One of the most important, and surely not the least 
frequent, of a teacher’s tasks is to awaken a child from 
the complacency of ignorance—an awakening made pos- 
sible because the child is endowed with curiosity. We 
all know how our own interest has often been aroused by 
the suggestion to us by another of a problem of which 
we had never thought, and, very possibly, never would 
have thought. To make such provocation to enquity 
regular and systematic is a teacher’s most delicate and 
most important task. Curiosity easily gets into a groove 
of habit as do all our other activities, and without dis 
turbing stimulus from without it would become narrow 
in its scope, and the individual would slowly petrify into 
the prejudiced pedant. 
But merely to propound a problem is not of necessity 
to make it a felt and accepted call to enquiry ; it must be 
so propounded that it arouses desire and stimulates 
activity, and this it can only do if the desire and the 
activity are, as it were, the next step in the direct line 
of growth from the intellectual position already attained. 
If that be secured it depends on the teacher’s personality, 
tact, and manner, whether the call be felt so feebly that 
no response, or a very anaemic response, takes place, of 
so strongly that it becomes an impulse to strenuous and 
persevering effort. So it is that teaching can nevef 
become a mere mechanical adherence to rules of method.
-P-A-G-E-302
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 283 
It is throughout a living intercourse of mind with mind, 
and the vital essence of its success is found, not in. * 
technical skill, but in the contagion of enthusiasm. . 
Successful teaching, then, must be based on knowlelge © 
of the natural mode of learning. One cannot stimulate 
a mind to an activity which is foreign to it; So it is 
that the successful teacher is always one who has a true 
insight into the workings of his pupils’ minds. Doubt-~ 
less these all differ, but they differ in detail only; the 
general mode of mental activity is common to us all, 
just as are the general modes of walking, breathing, and 
digesting. A clear apprehension of this general form of 
learning by experience should safeguard a teacher against 
fundamental mistakes; a misapprehension of it will 
surely lead him into error. One must have some idea of 
how one’s pupils learn or one cannot set out to teach 
them at all. In other words, every person who tries to 
teach has a theory of teaching. He may never have 
made it the object of explicit consideration, and so may 
be unable to expound it. But it reveals itself in the 
actual teaching of which it is implicitly determinative. 
Without clear thought on the nature of knowledge and 
learning, however, we are very apt to make false assump- 
tions which may go far to vitiate our teaching. 
The most common, and, perhaps, the most natural of 
such mistakes is that our thoughts are copies of the 
things we think about. Then it is easily assumed that 
such thoughts are built up little by little out of the 
elements into which at a later stage we can analyse them. 
The inference that teaching should begin with such 
elements and gradually combine them seemed obvious. 
So we had the maxim ‘‘ Proceed from the simple to the 
complex” interpreted to mean that the starting-point in 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
   284 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
teaching should be such elements studied in isolation, 
and the goal the concrete and complex whole. In har. 
mony with this, reading in the mother-tongue began 
with letters, then proceeded through syllables to words 
and thence'to sentences ; a foreign language was started 
by a study of its structure as set forth in its grammar; 
drawing by making simple straight lines, then curves, 
writing’ by practising separately the elements into which 
a perverted ingenuity could resolve each letter, and even 
the dictation of these elements. 
: It would be difficult to find a more striking example 
~ of the evils of a false theory. And the theory was false 
because it was not the outcome of a searching examina- 
tion of what exactly does go on in our experience when 
we learn something. It implied in its essence the 
confusion into which the uncritical mind so easily falls 
between its own thoughts and the things to which those 
thoughts refer. Its practical results were to divorce the 
teaching in school from the natural learning of the 
children, and thus to reduce school culture to the partot- 
like memorizing of words very imperfectly understood, 
and to delay the acquisition of all such arts as reading and 
drawing. Reading the child really had to learn in despite 
of his teacher’s method ; drawing, as a mode of express- 
ing ideas and of representing visible things, he very 
seldom learnt at all. Moreover, the separation of school 
lessons from actual life put the former into the class of 
things that do not really matter, and so they failed to 
evoke interest and energy. 
We may easily see how learning naturally goes on by 
examining how we make more precise and more complete 
our knowledge in some direction in which we are con- 
scious that it is defective. We find that the process is
-P-A-G-E-304
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 285 
not a putting together of elements each of which is first 
clearly grasped, but that it is the successive unfolding of 
the contents of a whole apprehended as such from the 
beginning. Suppose one knows little about a flower, 
and one sets to work to learn more, it may be by oneself, 
it may be under guidance. One’s very first apprehen- 
sion takes the flower as a whole, but a whole in many 
ways obscure and confused. Its general shape and colour: 
are clear; its composition is obscure. In other words, 
not the elements but the whole as such is clearly appre- 
hended first of all, and the aim of learning is to find more 
and more elements in the whole, and to discover the 
relations they hold to each other. As the object studied 
remains a whole, so our thought of it always holds it as 
a whole, and as we distinguish element after element we 
yet think them together as well as apart ; not as separate 
things but as separated constituents of one thing. 
Learning is, however, not a set of single acts without 
bearing on each other, but a continuous life-activity. In 
considering such examples as the above we are apt to 
forget this, and so to lose sight of the most important 
factor of all—habit, which is just as operative in mental 
as in physical acquisitions. Indeed, the latter are at the 
same time also the former, and the former always involve 
the organization of nerve-circuits even when they do not 
also carry with them series of muscular activities. We 
acquire skill in learning as truly as we do in acting, and 
in the same general way. Continued experiences of the 
same things do not succeed each other like reflexions in 
a mirror, each leaving no trace of itself. On the con- 
trary, each remains as a contribution to a gradually 
gtowing organ of knowledge. It is usually quite impos- 
sible to recall to mind the separate experiences, and so
-P-A-G-E-305
286 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
we do not in ordinary speech speak of them as remem- 
bered. But really they are retained in the most effective 
way. Had I to run through a long series of recalled 
meetings, and then compare the actor in each with the 
individual before me, before I could recognize a friend, 
the friendships I could form in life would be very few. 
And as the same process would be needed before I could 
recognize any object it is evident that my life could not 
go on. 
What does happen when we recognize a friend? | 
may safely defy any one of my readers to write down all 
the evidence. We see a person, it may be only his back, 
and immediately a thought of our friend prompts our 
actions: we go up to him and greet him. We do this 
without any deliberation, and at times we find that out 
interpretation of what we saw was wrong. But the 
question now is—What caused the recognition? A 
whole set of visual impressions related to each other in 
4 certain way and in their combination making a char- 
acteristic whole, but by far the greater part of which we 
are unable to indicate explicitly. So with all recogni- 
tion : it is the whole, as such a whole, which is recognized, 
and the recognition is immediate. If we find the char- 
acteristic marks at all it is afterwards, and that we 
generally do only when we have made a mistake, and 
seek to discover what led us wrong. The following 
anecdote will bring out the point : ‘‘ There is in Bristol 
a church which has a clock without any figures: in the 
places where the figures should be there is, in each cast, 
a single line; in fact, it looks as if the maker had put 
twelve ones, instead of the proper figures. I have asked 
a good many Bristol residents if they had noticed any- 
thing peculiar about the figures of the aforesaid clock,
-P-A-G-E-306
es LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 287 
and they have all with one accord replied, ‘No; they 
are just the same as any other clock.?”* 
Experiments on the recognition of letters and words, 
whose constituent elements can be separated out with 
absolute certainty, have added explicit proof. It is 
found that familiar words are recognized as quickly as 
single letters when exposed to sight for so small a fraction 
of a second that only one momentary act of perception is 
possible, and that longer and more unfamiliar words take 
but little longer. It is found further that when certain 
letters only of a word are shown, they are seen as the 
whole word ; that is, they are not seen to be an incom- 
plete group, but actually the missing lettersare perceived. 
Examination of our recognition of more complex 
objects, as a friend, bears out the suggestion here made 
that salient features act as the cue which starts the act of 
tecognition, and that they are not regarded or valued for 
themselves. Their whole function is that of suggestion 
or stimulus. ‘ . 
But the signs must be arranged in a certain way 
‘Ch r ct r* shown in this form would probably be read 
as‘character’. But if the order of the letters were wholly 
changed no such recognition would take place. The 
same, of course, is true if all the letters of a word are 
printed, but ina wrong order. If the right order be but 
litle changed we may in a rapid glance fail to notice the 
deviation from the ordinary form, which as a whole is so 
little altered that the word is recognized, even as we might 
Tecognize a friend though some change in his appearance, 
such as the removal of a beard, had been made. But 
if the order depart widely from the correct one recogni- 
tion is only possible after the letters have been sorted out 
1Edridge-Green : Memory and its Cultivation, p. 150.
-P-A-G-E-307
288 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
and re-arranged. Puzzles which have for their aim the 
formation of as many words as possible from a given set 
of letters illustrate the point. The ease with which in 
reading proofs one overlooks printers’ errors shows that 
the unit of recognition with a practised reader is not 
even the word but the phrase or sentence. In sucha 
case deviations of words are analogous to deviations of 
letters in the recognition of single words. The bearing 
of all this on that perceptual aspect of reading which 
consists in the recognition of printed symbols is obvious. 
Recognition is not always by sight. We hear a voice, 
and we know that a friend is near though we do not se 
him. All that is explicit in consciousness is the sound 
of his speech. But there is implicit a great deal more— 
‘a knowledge of his appearance, manner, and customary 
mode of behaviour. These things are not clearly in 
mind ; in no adequate or definite sense can they ever be 
so with those who cannot visualize the appearance to 
sight. They are there as expectations more or less clearly 
felt, and their presence is most easily detected indirectly 
by the surprise we feel when they are not fulfilled. If, 
for example, the occasion leads us to expect to see our 
friend in evening dress or in academical costume, though 
we have not had explicit thought of him as so attired we 
yet feel a shock of surprise if the unformulated expect 
tion is disappointed. 
Whatever the expectation may involve implicitly, 
explicitly it is that we shall see a certain person if we 
turn in the right direction. The heard voice, then, 
means to us the friend; because it revives the effect of 
past experiences as expectations which take a more or less 
specific form, not according to former experiences: but 
according to the present situation. To hear a clergy-
-P-A-G-E-308
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 289 
man’s voice at one time may mean to us the preaching 
of a sermon, at another the delivery of a lecture, at 
another a friendly chat. 
But there is a good deal behind all this, which has 
resulted from experience but which is not part of the 
expectation of the present moment, and, therefore, 
cannot be said to be even implicit in the present thought. 
Our friend means a good deal more to us than we expect 
to verify at any one time. We have built up our idea 
of him as a man; of his character, his disposition, his 
oddities, his pursuits, his likings and dislikings, and so 
on. These are all latent in our knowledge of him ; that 
is, they enter into the substance of that mental habit 
which relates us to him. But any of them may be absent 
from our thought of him on any one occasion, though, 
of course, on other occasions just those things may be 
the most prominent. 
Our mental habits or organs of knowledge, then, adapt 
themselves to the occasions which call them forth. Ina 
way my idea or knowledge of my friend is always one 
and the same; that is when it is withdrawn in thought 
fom real life and looked at as an abstraction. In 
another way—and this is the only way in which it is 
actual and concrete—it is always changing, for the 
emphasis is now here, now there, as the reference is now 
to this situation, now to that. 
It is evident, however, that the extent of this adapta- 
tion is determined by the number of elements to which 
at one time or another attention has been explicitly 
directed. For adaptation means that a certain aspect is 
Prominent, and that the relative clearness or obscurity 
of all others is determined by that. So we see that the 
total process of learning is to make explicit what is at 
w, T
-P-A-G-E-309
290 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
first implicit in thought, and then by familiarization to 
convert that explicit object of attention into latent know- 
ledge—a part of what we ‘take for granted’, to ux 
Professor Mitchell’s happy expression—whenever we 
use our knowledge in actual life. It is the recognition 
of the importance of this last element which led Dr Le 
Bon to say that ‘‘education is the art of converting the 
conscious into the unconscious.” Much of the ordinary 
talk about school teaching fails to grasp this and keepsits 
attention fixed on the conscious contents of the children’s 
minds, judging those contents by the expression of 
what is at the time uppermost. This leads to supet- 
ficiality. In their reaction from the abuse of learning 
by rote schools have shown a lamentable tendency 
to substitute intelligent inaccuracy for unintelligent 
thoroughness. What is wanted is intelligent thorough 
ness. 
Let us look at it in this way. Knowledge is a part of 
life, and is shown most truly in action. To be able to 
talk of anything is to know about it : to be able to doit, 
or to use it in our thoughts and acts, is to Anow it. It 
is the latter at which real learning aims, and the former 
is of value only as far as it testifies to the existence of the 
latter. The natural tendency of the school is to rely 00 
the former, and to be satisfied when that is more or less 
completely secured. That is only an instance of the 
proneness to deal with words rather than with actualities, 
and is consequently always to be suspected. Efficiency, 
however, is a matter of doing, not of talking, To be 
unable to describe is not of necessity a proof of inability 
todo. This is evident in all cases of bodily skill, butt 
is scarcely less true in cases of mental dexterity. A 
good bowler could not tell another person exactly how
-P-A-G-E-310
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 291 
he sends down the balls which are the despair of the 
batsmen. No matter how much he “bowls with his 
head,” he uses his intelligence to decide the kind of balk 
he shall send down, not to determine the various 
muscular movements by which he delivers just that kind 
of ball and no other. It would be a gross misuse of 
language to say that he does not know how to bowl 
such balls because he cannot describe the process in 
words, and probably has never in thought sorted out the 
elements of muscular movement involved and made 
them separately explicit to himself. As combinations of 
movements and result, distinguished by very slight 
differences of sensation, he has made them explicit in his 
practice. Only so could he adapt his movements so 
nicely to the attainment of the result he desires. His 
knowledge is the result of a long experience, and by that 
experience it continually becomes more precise, more 
sure, and more adaptable. He shows his knowledge in 
his act, and that act takes a vast amount for granted. 
Much of our knowledge remains always in this execu- 
tiveshape, in which the interest is essentially practical : so 
we may callit practical knowledge. It should be noted that 
itincludes all regulation of conduct, and not simply that 
kind of controlled action which is commonly termed skill. 
It isa practical judgement which tells us what to do in 
certain circumstances, and if the judgement be right and 
the action good it matters not at all whether it was the 
implicit adaptation to the situation of an organ of know- 
ledge of such a line of conduct, or the result of a 
theoretical deliberation ; unless, indeed, the call were for 
immediate action, in which case it is obvious that the 
need for the latter alternative is to be regretted. 
Generally it may be said that in actual life the practical
-P-A-G-E-311
292 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
judgement is continually called into play; theoretical 
deliberation only when the situation is beyond the 
immediate grasp of our pertinent knowledge, and that 
shows some defect in that knowledge. The time’ for 
action is not the time. for theoretical consideration, and 
the function of the latter is to enable the former to take 
more for granted than it otherwise could. 
Our knowledge, then, of anything whatever is never 
confined to what we have explicit in consciousness at the 
moment, or even to what is implicit. A great deal we 
take for granted, and that is not directly under the contra 
of will. We cannot remember it at the time, yet tht 
it was not forgotten is often proved by its explicit recur- 
rence to consciousness at a later time. Most people 
who have answered examination papers can verify this 
from their own experience. The process of passing it 
review all we know of a certain subject, and that of 
using such knowledge implicitly either in practical lift 
or in thinking, are quite distinct, and it is remarkable 
that the power to do the former should be regarded # 
an infallible test of ability to do the latter. To expound 
the various compositions of forces which are employed 
ina game of billiards and to be a good billiard player 
are quite different things. Yet in examinations we cot 
tinually test only the former kind of power, and 9 
encourage the common but erroneous idea that know 
ledge is a possession and not a capacity. 
I have assumed, what is indeed the truth, that in actu 
learning attention may be given at will either to things 
as wholes or to separate qualities and relations of them. 
It is a common error, but a most mischievous one, 10 
assume that a child does not use general ideas. The 
mere fact that he has a large number of experiences of
-P-A-G-E-312
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 293 
the same person or thing, and that these all become 
absorbed in his knowledge, means that that knowledge 
is sufficiently general to cover not only all the divergencies 
already experienced but others which are not too widely 
diferent from them. He sees his mother doing now 
this, now that; he hears her in affection, in direc- 
tion, in prohibition, in reproof, or talking to someone 
not himself. His idea of his mother includes all this: 
this is all either explicit or implicit or taken for granted 
in his thought of her at any moment. In other words, 
his idea of his mother is a general idea though referred 
toa particular person. 
Of course, immediately he learns to speak he finds 
different objects combined under one name, but not 
arbitrarily, The name helps him, indeed, but it helps 
him only along the line of the advance he is already 
making. The similarities of things which have the same 
tame have been operative in his growing thought, not 
because he has said to himself ‘‘ This is like that”, but 
because the fact of likeness has caused him to take 
“this” as something which can be substituted for 
“that” for certain practical purposes. 
Logically, the recognition of things and the practical 
dealing with them is precedent to general notions of 
them. But in the actual life of the soul the two are 
ever present—~at any rate after the first few months of 
life—one being explicitly attended to, the other being 
implicitly thought or assumed. 
Now, the natural interests of the child cause him to 
value things for their practical uses. Their qualities and 
relations to each other are thought only in their bearing 
on the activity in hand. It is essentially the function 
of the school to intervene in the natural learning-process
-P-A-G-E-313
294 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
in such a way that these qualities and relations may be 
felt to be worth considering in themselves. This means 
that the instinct of curiosity should be made independent 
of that of constructive activity. But the new interest 
must grow out of the old, or it will be but a sickly plant, 
if, indeed, it be not a mere artificial parody of the reality. | 
In the earlier years, as has been seen, the child’s interests 
centre in his own actions. To him the really important 
question about anything is—‘‘ What can I do with it?” 
But this question shows that the most fundamental generd 
idea which he will need in reaching a knowledge of the 
reality which surrounds him and of which he formsapat, 
is already nascent. For he regards himself as an efficient 
cause, able by his actions to exercise power over some 
thing not himself, and so to make such change in ita 
seems to him good. His frequent failures bring home 
to him the intractability of matter as well as its tracte 
bility, and so develop the idea of things as existing 
independently of himself, but as opposing his efforts 
by their own. This idea develops, as we may say, within 
the implicit apprehension of causality, and in its develop- 
ment it little by little clarifies that apprehension. 
Similarly his dealings with things causes the idea of 
space to grow implicitly as part of his thought of his 
own actions. He can move some things from one plat 
to another, he can approach others or withdraw further 
from them. As these acts are done the visual impret 
sions he receives change. So all these experiences grow 
together into his thought of actions, and any one of 
them may act as a cue to him to do this or that, in the 
doing of which he takes for granted more and more of 
the relations of space as his knowledge grows. 
In an analogous way he begins to distinguish pas
-P-A-G-E-314
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 295 
present, and future, and that very early. All expecta- 
tion, no matter how vague, points to the future; all 
recall, no matter how hazy, refers to the past. Satis- 
faction, and yet more disappointment, make the expec- 
tation definite. What was looked for in the future is 
now in the present regretted as an unfulfilled longing 
of the past. 
Lastly, long before he learns to count—that is, to 
attend explicitly to number as such—he has learnt to 
distinguish as wholes groups which differ in number up 
to four or five. 
Thus, all the fundamental ideas which articulate a 
general conception of reality are very early operative in 
the child’s thought. They are known implicitly, and 
that they are so known is shown by the fact that they 
guide actions. Like the bowler in bowling, so the boy 
in flying a kite or in whipping a top, shows a working 
knowledge of certain laws of physics which he acts upon 
though he does not, and perhaps can not, separately 
think of them. 
To ignore in teaching this very obvious and very 
important fact is positively to hinder mental develop- 
ment. Constant attention to the insignificant is not the 
true method of teaching or of learning, Observation 
of details is carried too far immediately the knowledge 
of those details is made an end in itself. It never is 
such an end in the natural and informal learning of the 
child: he wants to use everything he learns so as to 
satisfy some impulse or to attain some purpose. Nor 
is it, according to any rational conception of knowledge. 
For knowledge means apprehension of meaning, and 
Meaning is found in relation. This, we have seen, is 
implicit with the child. But it will not be made
-P-A-G-E-315
296 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
sufficiently explicit without the prompting of the teacher, 
Real advance in learning is the increased ability to think 
reality as a systematic unity in which every part holds 
its true place and fulfils its true function. This means 
explicit apprehension of relations, but not encyclopaedic 
apprehension of facts. A fact is of worth for knowledge 
just to the extent to which it has a meaning ; and mean- 
ing is, as has been seen, what past experience has enabled 
us to take for granted. Into a really systematic thought 
of reality new facts are easily absorbed. And this is 
true of partial as well as of complete thoughts. Consider 
the ease with which a zoologist sees the function and 
place of a new species of animal, whether now living 
or long since extinct. 
On the other hand, an undue haste to think relations 
as such leads to emptiness of knowledge. Too often 
it has produced systems of supposed reality constructed 
out of the inner consciousness of some philosopher, and 
having little affinity with the actual nature of the world. 
To teach children general ideas as such is to train their 
minds to bé sounding brass and tinkling cymbals. 
The illustration supplied by the method of teaching 
geometry, first by learning statements of the most general 
truths and afterwards certain applications of those truths 
will occur to every reader. The empirical modem 
methods seem in danger of falling into Charybdis in theit 
‘avoidance of Scylla, and of setting forth a geometry 
devoid both of precision of idea and of rigidity of proof. 
“Proceed from the concrete to the abstract” says the 
old tag, giving advice incompatible with the other direc- 
tion to ‘proceed from the simple to the complex”, s0 
far as each is understood in the same reference, For the 
‘abstract? of the former is the ‘simple? of the latter if
-P-A-G-E-316
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 297 
the reference be to the matter to be studied. But in 
truth, no matter how it is interpreted, it is difficult to give 
this maxim a true meaning. For though attention may 
be explicitly fixed on a relation or a quality yet the rest of 
the concrete must be implicitly thought at the same 
time. On the other hand, when the concrete whole is 
explicitly attended to its qualities and relations are 
implicitly held in thought. In each case the whole of 
knowledge—which is both abstract and concrete—must 
be thought. The real progress is from a concrete 
vaguely apprehended to the same concrete more com- 
pletely known and more exactly thought. True, the 
means is by a successive study of qualities and relations ; 
but always as qualities and relations of the whole in 
question, not as independent existences. In a word, 
knowledge is always of the concrete, for it is always of 
reality or of a part of reality, and all reality is concrete. 
But the concrete is a system of relations, each of which 
may be separately attended to while explicit thought is 
abstracted from the rest. Thus, every abstract is a 
partial view of a concrete, and every concrete is a syste-. 
matic whole in which it is possible to take many such 
views, 
Life, however, is always concrete. It is the doing 
of real things by a real person amidst real surroundings. 
And true knowledge is a constituent of life. Know- 
ledge of relation can, then, be nothing more than the 
explicit attending to relations which are already implicitly 
known or have already been taken for granted and acted 
upon, Teaching does not change the nature of the 
evolution of thought, but only stimulates and accelerates 
it. It follows that no true teaching of abstract ideas 
can be given to children who have not a sufficiently wide
-P-A-G-E-317
298 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
and copious practical experience embodying those 
ideas. 
The first function of a school as a teaching institution 
is, then, to secure that the child’s practical knowledge is 
exact and full. Of course, much of it is acquired out 
of school, and can only be acquired there. But the 
schoo] can both systematize that knowledge and make it 
more definite in its reference. 
If our knowledge of things were a set of copies of 
them and a mere composition of sensations, then the 
presence of any object to our senses would ensure that 
we had knowledge of it. That this is not so everyone 
is well aware. Many things are present to the sight of 
each one of us daily and yet we get no knowledge of 
them. Only when we make definite acts of attention 
do we get knowledge, and acts of attention imply some 
purpose more or less clearly felt which limits the range 
of what we notice. Thus, ‘the training of the obser- 
vation’ which it is so fashionable now-a-days to recom 
mend to teachers is a very mischievous thing if it mean, 
as very often it seems to do, an encouragement of indis- 
criminate looking at all and sundry. From that, indeed, 
the school has to start, for that kind of scatter-brained 
observation is natural to young children. But the 
school’s starting-point is not the end of its endeavour. 
Nor is that end found by simply increasing the range of 
the child’s observations, but rather by developing their 
character in intensity and accuracy. Truly we have to 
learn to perceive, and that seems to be one of the most 
difficult ideas to get into people’s minds. ‘‘If it was 
there I must have seen it” men often say, and yet hourly 
hundreds of things are ‘‘ there” and we do not see them. 
Even what we do see we often see wrongly. Every
-P-A-G-E-318
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 299 
mistake in recognition is a case in point, and conflict of 
testimony between two quite truthful eye-witnesses of 
an event is quite a normal occurrence. 
Learning to perceive is learning to concentrate atten- 
tion on certain things and to ignore everything else. 
The power of such selection does not come by nature. 
It has to be laboriously learnt just like any other form 
of skill. Attention seeks its objects and at first often 
errs. Gradually more and more signs are absorbed in 
the growing aptitude, more and more is taken for 
granted, till the selection of the pertinent is immediate 
and largely automatic. This is most admirably put by 
Mr S. E. White in a chapter “On seeing Deer” in his 
book The Mountain— : 
“Tn the elimination of the obvious rests the whole 
secret of seeing deer in the woods. 
“In travelling the trail you will notice two things: 
that a tenderfoot will habitually contemplate the horn 
of his saddle or the trail a few yards ahead of his horse’s 
hose, with occasionally a look about at the landscape ; 
and the old-timer will be constantly searching the pros- 
pect with keen understanding eyes. Now in the 
occasional glances the tenderfoot takes, his perceptions 
have room for just so many impressions. When the 
number is filled out he sees nothing more. Naturally 
the obvious features of the landscape supply the basis for 
these impressions. He sees the configuration of the 
mountains, the nature of their covering, the course of 
their ravines, first of all. Then if.he looks more closely, 
there catches his eye an odd-shaped rock, a burned black 
stub, a flowering bush, or some such matter. Anything 
less striking in its appeal to the attention actually has 
not room for its recognition. In other words, suppos-
-P-A-G-E-319
300 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
ing that a man has the natural ability to receive » visual 
impressions, the tenderfoot fills out his full capacity with 
the striking features of his surroundings. To be able 
to see anything more obscure in form or colour, he must 
naturally put aside from his attention some one oranother 
of these obvious features. He can, for example, look 
for a particular kind of flower on a side ‘hill only by 
refusing to see other kinds. 
“Tf this is plain, then, go one step further in the logic 
of that reasoning. Put yourself in the mental attitude 
of a man looking for deer. His eye sweeps rapidly over 
a side hill; so rapidly that you cannot understand how 
he can have gathered the main features of that hill, let 
alone concentrate and refine his attention to the seeing 
of an animal under a bush. As a matter of fact he pays 
no attention to the main features. He has trained his 
eye, not so much to see things, as to leave things out. 
The odd-shaped rock, the charred stub, the bright flower- 
ing bush do not exist for him. His eye passes over 
them as unseeing as yours over the patch of brown ot 
gray that represents his quarry. His attention stops on 
the unusual, just as does yours; only in his case the 
unusual is not the obvious. He has succeeded by long 
training in eliminating that. Therefore he sees deer 
where you do not. As soon as you can forget the natut- 
ally obvious and construct an artificially obvious, then 
you too will see deer. 
“These animals are strangely invisible to the untrained 
eye even when they are standing ‘in plain sight” You 
can look straight at them, and not see them at all. Then 
some old woodman lets you sight over his finger exactly 
to the spot. At once the figure of the deer fairly leaps 
into vision. I know of no more perfect example of the
-P-A-G-E-320
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE jor 
instantaneous than this. You are filled with astonish- 
ment that you could for a moment have avoided seeing 
it. And yet next time you will in all probability repeat 
just this ‘puzzle picture’ experience... 
“To enjoy the finer savour of seeing deer, you should 
start out definitely with that object in view. Thus you 
have opportunity for the display of a certain finer wood- 
craft. You must know where the objects of your search 
are likely to be found, and that depends on the time of 
year, the time of day, their age, their sex, a hundred 
little things.” 
Here we have the whole theory of perception described 
in a case in which it is impossible to avoid recognizing 
that the power is only attained as, the result of much 
learning through practice. The essence of that power 
is the ability to ignore and omit by far the greater part 
of what is present. ‘The perceptive activity is dominated 
throughout by the purpose in hand, and under that 
guidance the organ of knowledge adapts itself with great 
nicety and nearly automatically to the demands of the 
sccasion. The observation is good in proportion as it 
18 not diffuse. When this is grasped—and the reader 
will do well to examine examples from his own experience 
of successful and unsuccessful looking for things—the 
futility of cultivating gaping under the cloak of training 
the observation becomes evident. That process, so far 
from developing a faculty of fruitful, that is, purposive, 
observation, forms and strengthens its very antithesis 
~—the habit of glancing at everything and really seeing 
nothing. It is plain, too, that nobody can train the 
observation even of a child in matters of which his own 
knowledge is essentially superficial. 
In these practical matters one feels the growth of
-P-A-G-E-321
302 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
one’s knowledge and capacity because one can do better 
what one wishes todo. This consciousness of increasing 
power is itself one of the greatest and most spontaneous 
delights of life—a delight especially felt by the young 
—and is itself a sufficient motive to action independently 
of the result the action actually attains. This we see 
in every boy engaged in manual construction, practising 
at the nets, or, indeed, engaged in any occupation which 
demands skill. He finds delight in the activity and not 
only in the result. This again is well illustrated by 
Mr White in the chapter from which I have already 
quoted— 
“Suppose you've been climbing a mountain late in 
the afternoon when the sun is on the other side of it. 
It is a mountain of big boulders, loose little stones, 
thorny bushes. The slightest misstep would send 
pebbles rattling, brush rustling ; but you have gone all 
the way without making that misstep. This is quite 
a feat. It means that you've known all about every 
footstep you've taken. That would be business enough 
for most people, wouldn’t it? But in addition you've 
managed to see everything on that side of the mountain 
—especially patches of brown. You've seen lots of 
patches of brown, and you’ve examined each one of 
them. Besides that, you’ve heard lots of little rustlings, 
and you’ve identified each one of them. To do all these 
things well keys your nerves to a high tension, doesn’t 
it? And then near the top you look up from your last 
noiseless step to see in the brush a very dim patch of 
brown. If you hadn’t been looking so hard, you surely 
wouldn’t have made it out. Perhaps, if you're not 
humble-minded, you may reflect that most people 
wouldn’t have seen it at all. You whistle once sharply.
-P-A-G-E-322
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 303 
The patch of brown defines itself. Your heart gives 
onebig jump. You know that you have but the briefest: 
moment, the tiniest fraction of time, to hold the white 
bead of your rifle motionless and to press the trigger. 
It has to be done very steadily, at that distance,—and 
you out of breath, with your nerves keyed high in the 
tension of such caution.... The reason I can bear to 
kill deer is because, to kill deer, you must accomplish a 
skilful elimination of the obvious.” 
Only by careful practice does our perceptual know- 
ledge attain clearness and precision—a clearness and pre- 
cision shown in our practical use of it, not in our talking 
about it. Evidently only from such clear and precise 
knowledge can we develop clear and precise thought of 
qualities and relations. Our concepts or general ideas 
cannot be more accurate than the perceptual knowledge 
in which they are studied. 
Apply this to certain traditional methods of teaching. 
A short time ago I was showing a party of some score 
of boys of eleven to thirteen years old over an old abbey, 
and I asked them to estimate the length of the ruined 
church. Only one was approximately right, the others 
without exception estimated it at less than half its actual 
length. ‘These boys could work all sorts of sums involv- 
ing questions of length and area. What relation can 
such exercises have to their real life when the numbers 
are so devoid of real and true meaning for them? The 
general and abstract relations of numbers which we call 
Arithmetic are significant to a child exactly in the degree 
to which they can be referred to real experiences of 
Movement. From such experiences they must, there- 
fore, be developed if the teaching of arithmetic is to be 
more than a drill in the more or less skilful manipulation
-P-A-G-E-323
304 .THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
of the elements of an artificial world of empty names 
and symbols. 
So it is with geometry. The aim is to examine certain 
relations of space, and to do this the relations must be 
attended to by themselves and apart from things in which 
they are embodied. But they must be implicitly known 
as embodied before even a beginning can be made with 
considering them apart. ‘The mind which is to consider 
them must be the mind to find them where alone they 
can be found—in the real world of experience. 
Perceptual knowledge is the result of doing, and its 
test is in doing. Let us apply that to the study of form 
and colour. There is a doing by the eye in both cases. 
So there is in such a series of perceptual acts as was 
described in the last extract from Mr White. But that 
series was made real by being experienced not only by 
sight but by climbing. Similarly, the visual perception 
of form is made more exact and explicit by modelling 
and drawing, and that of colour by painting. I am not 
speaking now of these exercises as developing artistic 
taste, but simply as helping and expressing visual per 
ceptions. I have seen two sets of drawings from two 
neighbouring schools produced by children of six of 
seven years of age, who had been given similar amounts 
of instruction in drawing. The one class had from the 
first drawn the objects they were attending to by sight, 
and had been led to look for inaccuracies in representa” 
tion and to correct them. The other poor little souls 
had been put through the weary and soul-killing drill 
of lines straight and curved, representing nothing 10 
heaven or in earth. In each case a lady teacher w® 
asked to stand before the class, and the children wer 
told to draw a picture of their teacher. ‘The formet

produced quite respectable sketches showing the char- 
acteristic features of dress and attitude. The latter sent 
in nothing but the outline skeletons which are character- 
istic of the untrained drawings of young children and 
of savages. In other words the lessons they had under- 
gone in drawing had not advanced them one single step 
in the power of representing by the pencil the appearance 
an object present to sight. Translate this into the 
language of our present subject and there can remain 
no doubt that the former children had learnt to see more 
and to see better than the latter. In no way can we 
avoid the conclusion except by assuming that to see is 
only to use the eyes and not yet more to exercise the 
intellectual power of noticing distinctive marks. 
Similar remarks apply to the assistance given by 
painting to the discrimination of colours. This is by 
no means a mere matter of sight. No young child, no 
matter how excellent his eyes, can discriminate all the 
shades which to an adult are quite distinct. The effort 
to match the colours of the paints with those of the 
abject to be copied means the very definite fixing of 
attention on that point, and concentration of attention is 
the one and only mode of securing increased accuracy 
and precision. 
All ideas of natural objects and phenomena must 
similarly be founded in accurate observation. Often the 
thildren have already made some observations of the 
facts required ; it is for the school to make those obser- 
vations more purposeful, more exact, more systematic. 
“Few {young children] have not seen at least a small 
brook; but many vague and often erroneous notions 
have probably found their way into their minds through 
lack of guidance in observing. They have probably an

exaggerated notion of the permanence, not only of its 
general form, but even of details, such as the pebbles in 
its course and the soil on its banks. They assume 
uniformity where there is really diversity, as, for instance, 
they imagine its course to be normally straight, whereas 
bends are the rule, and straightness the exception ; they 
suppose the rate of flow to be uniform, both as regards 
various parts of its course, and as regards the cross- 
section at any point; and they project the width and 
depth of the point at which they are most familiar with 
it, both to its higher and its lower reaches. These 
wrong impressions concerning the local stream will 
naturally be transferred to their idea of the larger rivers 
of which they hear in the Geography lesson. The work 
of [teaching] will be devoted to correcting these false 
impressions by sight of the actual facts, and by such 
guidance in their observations as will lead them to notice 
what might otherwise pass unnoticed.” ! 
The points to which explicit attention is directed will 
necessarily vary-with the psychological age of the children, 
and with the amount of cognate knowledge they already 
possess. Every real challenge to enquiry is in the form 
of an unexpected difference. Thus discrimination pro- 
ceeds step by step. A child who cannot distinguish red 
from yellow certainly cannot perceive orange as different 
from both and intermediate between them. So such 
observations on a stream as are suggested in the passage 
quoted would at first be purely qualitative. Only, for 
example, when it is seen that speed does vary will the 
problem of measuring the different rates arise. 
If the doctrine of the preceding pages be accepted it

will, like other doctrines, be seen in practice. Schoolsare 
too bookish, and in that they are so they defeat their own. 
object. Granted that that object is to give their pupils 
systematic knowledge, and that systematic knowledge of 
necessity involves the study of abstract relations, yet it 
is now clear that the best progress will be made by 
following the natural order by which such relations are: 
developed in concrete experience. Then from the very 
first they are full of meaning, and meaning really implies 
some form of usefulness. The knowledge of them thus 
gained is real, because it results from the normal working 
of the intelligence in solving the problems life presents. 
to it. Of course, without the school many of these 
problems would never have been presented in such a. 
way as to evoke desire and effort for their solution. 
That gives the teacher the fundamental criterion of the 
value both of the subject-matter and of the form of his 
teaching. But to insist on the study of abstractions 
which are presented to the minds of the pupils as arising 
ina vacuum, and which suggest no problem felt as an 
intellectual need, is to strangle curiosity, to starve the: 
desire for knowledge, and towturn the ordinary healthy 
mind from such skeletons to the real interests of life. 
Thus it has come to pass that the out-of-school interests 
have often been a boy’s only salvation from intellectual 
atrophy, and that many of those men who have made 
the greatest advances in human knowledge have had no 
connexion with the orthodox places of instruction. 
School and life must be in the closest contact if school 
is to do its true work. 
The direct study of things is, then, needful from two 
points of view—~as bearing on those practical activities 
which make up so much of life ; and as providing occa-
-P-A-G-E-327
308 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
sions for the development of theoretical interest, or the 
desire to know because to know is itself a human good, 
This conceptual knowledge begins to arise whenever in 
thought we set ourselves to examine the qualities of an 
object separately. In perceptual knowledge each thing 
is taken as a whole, and what we so unify depends on 
the object in view. A ‘thing, for example, may bea 
school, a class, a boy, or a boy’s arm or hand or finger, 
according as the practical activity is concerned with one 
or other of these groups. For always a ‘thing’ isa 
group in the sense that from it we can get a variety of 
impressions. In practical activity the group is the unit, 
and it is as a whole that it prompts to further action. So 
in climbing a mountain-side a stone is a thing on which 
one can place one’s foot, and its relation to the rest of 
the slope suggests the next movement. We are not 
then interested in the composition or origin of the stone, 
but only in its function as a support. When, however, 
there is no such practical end in view, or when its accom- 
plishment is not pressing, the interest may be drawn 
to the stone itself. A geologist’s attention, for instance, 
may be awakened by such a stone, so that for the time 
his practical purpose of getting up the mountain falls 
into abeyance, and the theoretical purpose of finding out 
the stone’s nature and origin takes its place. 
In every case such a theoretical purpose involves 4 
different attitude of mind from that in a practical pur 
pose. The object is no longer a unit amid other units 
and related to them in terms of the practical activity of 
the moment. It is now a system in itself, and the 
question is as to the composition of this system. This 
means that we hold apart in thought what is not sepat- 
ated in space or in time. In perception each object is 
ee ef ....
-P-A-G-E-328
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 309 
seen as separate in space from every other, and as in some 
definite relation to it. So the objects come into the 
practical experience successively in time. But when we 
separate in thought the colour from the form of an object 
we hold apart as objects of attention what in reality are 
never apart. Nor is the separation absolute. While 
form is explicit colour is implicit, though, it may be, 
only in the vaguest and faintest way. So, although 
we may attend to form and to colour successively, 
yet we are aware that they co-exist in time as well as 
in space. 
Such concentration of attention on an element which 
cannot be detached in space or time from the system of 
which it forms a part is much aided by the use of 
language, if, indeed, it would be possible without such 
help. A sign of some sort to give a kind of artificial 
independence to each element seems necessary, and such 
signs are given, most conveniently to most of us, by 
words. If I can mark the colour of the grass by the 
word ‘green? and the colour of an ivy-leaf by the same 
word Iam greatly helped in relating the two colours, 
imespective of the great differences in general appearance 
of grass and ivy. Generally it may be said that com- 
patison and the noting of difference is the mode in which 
the general ideas connoted by words become precise and 
explicit. 
There is, however, a danger in this use of words. 
Words are themselves separate objects of perception ; 
as such we see them printed or hear them uttered. So 
We are apt to attribute a similar independence to the 
qualities they name. The step from this to imagining 
things as built up of their qualities, as a wall is built up 
of bricks, is an easy one. ‘The results of taking it are,
-P-A-G-E-329
310 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION” 
as has already been said, fatal to any true idea of know 
ledge. 
A further result is yet more disastrous. General 
terms are looked upon as signs not only of the existence 
of certain qualities in things, but as implying some other 
kind of existence of which each is the name in the same 
way as ‘Queen Elizabeth? was the name of an actual 
person. So duty and virtue are regarded as existing 
in this world of shadows instead of being found—and 
found only—in definite concrete acts. But, so far as we 
can ever know, the only existence corresponding to a 
general term is the presence of a certain quality or set of 
qualities, relation or set of relations, in the real things of 
the world, all of which are objects of concrete perceptual 
knowledge. The world of conceptions is the mode in 
which we think the real world of experience, not another, 
a higher and sublimated world, whose relations to the real 
world of things and deeds is shadowy if not unknows. 
If this be grasped it will surely be impossible to try t 
teach abstractions apart from perceptual reality and out 
of connexion with it. 
All theoretical knowledge, then, begins with analysis 
of a thing into its qualities, and the result is an ide 
which is potentially general. It is used in a general 
way—that is, as applicable to other things of the same 
kind—long before it is consciously thought as general. 
A child will, indeed, generalize his terms too widely, and 
will call every man ‘papa’ or every flower a ‘rose’; 
certainly not because he has analysed and found generdl 
qualities, but simply because he has no appreciation of 
the differences which exclude things from the range of 
a term which applies to other things in some way simile. 
“When this stage is passed a very little similarity wil
-P-A-G-E-330
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 311 
still lead a child to use a term generally. But it is only 
when the similarity has been definitely attended to that 
this extension of the application of the term is conscious. 
To think the term as general, apart from any immediate 
all for its application, is to take the further step of 
making explicit the generality which before was implicit. 
It is the same mental process as we have already traced 
in perception, but it is now exercised on objects separated 
by thought and not by mode of existence. 
This further step grows out of comparison, or the 
noting of similarities. It must be remembered that 
similarity is implicitly operative long before it is itself 
made the object of explicit thought. Throughout life 
this is so. We often class things together on account 
of a felt similarity without asking ourselves in what the 
similarity consists. Indeed, this is nearly always so in 
clss recognition as distinguished from individual recog- 
nition, We feel no hesitation in saying of an object 
we have never seen before that it is a church or a watch, 
and in such cases we do not set before ourselves its 
quilities side by side with those remembered as belong- 
ing to other churches or watches. Similarly, if we 
see a box which we wish to open we assume it to be like 
other boxes in that respect. It is only when we are 
balked that we set ourselves to examine this special box 
to see in what way its resemblance to other boxes fails. 
The discovery of the difference does not destroy our 
general idea of a box, nor does it limit it. On the 
contrary it enriches it, as we now include in it a new 
possibility of mode of opening in addition to those we 
already knew. 
Here again we are brought face to face with a danger 
arising from the use of language. We find it con-
-P-A-G-E-331
312 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
venient to express the most essential marks of a gener 
idea in words, and we call the statement a ‘definition’, 
Then we are apt to think the definition is a statement 
of the meaning. Buta definition can only state qualities 
which are found in every instance of the general term, 
and that in the same general form. So any quality in 
which a variation is found must be excluded. For 
example, as not all tables are square, ‘ square’ cannot be 
part of the definition of table. Nor, for the same reason, 
can any other shape; and yet every table must have 
shape, and some shapes would be felt to be excluded. 
It follows that the more variations we know the more 
meagre becomes our definition. But at the same time 
the fuller becomes the implicit meaning of the term, 
and the more knowledge we take for granted in using 
it. A definition, then, is a purely artificial skeleton of 
meaning, not the real living tissue of meaning which 
alone can function in the life of the soul. 
The bearing of this on much common teaching is 
obvious. The teacher too often confuses definition with 
meaning, and as a result teaches mere empty words 
Meaning comes only from experience ; definition may 
be taught to a parrot, and it would be little more difficult 
to teach young children definitions in Greek or in Chinese 
than to teach them in English when the definitions ate 
not the outcome of their own thought on their own lives, 
and the result would be nearly, if not quite, as valuable. 
Almost every ‘howler’ in an examination paper isan indi- 
cation that the child has tried to learn symbols which to 
him symbolized no living reality. 
No examination into the nature of objects goes far 
without bringing into prominence some relations to 
other objects. These, as has been seen, are al] implicit
-P-A-G-E-332
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 313 
in practical knowledge. The most important of them 
is causation, and this is very early the object of interest, 
because it lies at the root of success in every thing the 
child attempts todo. Yet there are writers who tell us 
that a child cannot grasp the causal relation. That he 
is unable to understand it as a metaphysical conception 
wegladly grant. So, to say the least, is the vast majority 
of adults. But as a practical idea it is clear enough to 
him, and nothing delights him more than to discover 
the causal bond in any particular case in which he is 
interested. 
The natural appetite for effective knowledge of cause 
should be fed and encouraged in every possible way. 
But it cannot be satisfied with words; they only drug 
it If a boy desire to know the cause of any event it 
is because he already knows something of the nature 
of that event and wants to know more. This more he 
should discover for himself. The utmost'a wise teacher 
will do will be to suggest lines of enquiry. Unless the 
boy conduct the enquiry the whole process is worthless 
as a development of efficiency in thought. It is in 
this regard that so much ‘science teaching’ fails to be 
scientific teaching. Boys work indeed in laboratories, 
but they commonly work under so minute direc- 
tion that they never feel the spur of an unsolved 
problem. Consequently they never exercise analytic 
thought in an attempt to solve such a problem. They 
Manipulate apparatus, which often embodies a whole 
system of knowledge of which they are ignorant and 
which consequently they could not have invented for 
themselves, and they watch results. The whole process

open to the charge that it concentrates attention on the

insignificant, and does so with the greatest possible waste 
of time. Laboratory work is only profitable when it 
is a definite and conscious seeking by each individual 
pupil of the answer to a problem which he himself has 
felt as such, though probably he would not have so felt 
it without his teacher’s suggestions. If a pupil is not 
old enough to work in this way he is not old enough 
to work in a laboratory at all; there is much mor 
profitable work which he can do outside. 
The use of complicated apparatus ina school laboratory 
is to be deprecated whenever the pupils are too young 
to grasp the systems of knowledge embodied in them. 
A great difficulty in scientific advance is always the 
invention of apparatus fitted to test a hypothesis. The 
great discoverers have always at first used apparatus 
which, as compared with later developments, was simple 
and rough. Scientific advance means increased perfec- 
tion of apparatus as well as of thought. With rough 
apparatus no doubt the results are rough. But the educa 
tive aim is not a precise result in the demonstration, but 
improvement in the capacity of the pupil. To advance 
along the actual lines on which knowledge of scienc 
has advanced, to follow in the footsteps of the great 
pioneers, gives, moreover, a human stimulus which is 
otherwise wanting. If a student feel that he is cot 
fronted with a problem with which Faraday was cor 
fronted the character of his work as an advance into new 
fields of knowledge is much more apparent to him. 
Yea, and his failure to succeed where Faraday did succeed 
will be a wholesome curb to the spirit which is apt t0 
be developed by exhortations—too often given—to 
believe only on the evidence of his own experience. Let 
him learn that
-P-A-G-E-334
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 315 
“knowledge means 
Ever-renewed assurance by defeat 
That victory is somehow still to reach.” 
Nowhere, perhaps, do we see the evils of seeking the 
effect of instruction on the side of the matter so plainly as 
in much of the teaching of science. The visible ‘result’ 
which can be directly appreciated is accepted as a substi- 
tute for, or at least as a measure of, the educative result 
in the development of mental efficiency which it seems 
so hard to gauge. Yet really it is not so. Increased 
efiiciency shows itself in increased power to do appropri- 
ate things. A boy’s real advance in any course of 
lessons, whether in ‘science’ or in any other subject, is 
exactly measured by his power to work independently 
of guidance in that subject. 
All knowledge, then, is one. Whether we look at it 
perceptually or consider it conceptually it is the under- 
standing of our own experience. Separated from that 
itis nothing. If it enter not into our lives it is of no 
effect. Its explicit forms alternate according to the 
needs of the moment-—now we dwell on the actual doing, 
tow on the theoretical considerations. But whichever 
is foremost in thought the other aspect is in the back- 
ground. Moreover, we have seen that growth in 
knowledge does not mean the amassing of an increasing 
heap of facts, but a richer, more vigorous, and more 
powerful organ of knowledge—of matter which we take 
forgranted and which operates immediately and efficiently 
in giving meaning and direction to our lives. 
Tt is in this undiscriminated manner that most of our 
personal experiences are retained and recalled. The 
explicit setting before consciousness of a memory of

316 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
some definite past act or event is exceptional. Onlya 
very small proportion of our doings and sufferings are 
thus individualized. Let the reader test this by trying 
to recall the sequence of his acts and thoughts during 
the last week. He will find that comparatively few of 
them can be made explicit. He may be able to sy 
generally what he did on a certain day, but much of this 
is inference from the habitual ordering of his life. He 
went to school and taught, and he will remember in 
general outline what he taught. Even this he finds him- 
self unable to do if he take for consideration a day ina 
more remote past. He may possibly know that ona 
definite day ten years ago he went to school and taught, 
but he knows it, not because he recalls the event as such, 
but because he knows the routine of his life at the time 
and does not remember any deviation from it. We 
remember deviations from routine because, being excep- 
tional, they arrest more attention to themselves, and thus 
add a vividness and intensity to the experience. ‘“Per- 
versely enough the times when you did sof see deer are 
more apt to remain vivid in your memory than the times 
when you did”, says Mr White in the chapter from 
which I have already quoted. ‘This is only an example 
of the general rule that what impresses us most at the 
time is most easily recalled. Disappointment by its 
emotional shock adds enormously to the impression made 
by the event. It is the unnatural and unexpected out 
come of a process of activity intended to secure quite 
another end. So the even flow of mental life is broken 
and checked, and such arrest makes a deep impression. 
Similarly, a person will remember vividly an occasion 
on which he made himself conspicuous by some breach 
of the conventionalities, while he will forget innumerable 
|
-P-A-G-E-336
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 317 
instances in which he fell into no such unpleasant 
mistake. 
Much of our definite recall of our past is, then, a 
construction, in which a few really recalled events are 
built into a framework of general knowledge of the 
habitual ordering of life. So it is that the older we get 
the less we remember the ordinary every-day events as 
such. They have become matters of routine and of 
habit, and so no special call on the attention has been 
required to secure that they were done. We remember 
an illness because it broke such routine as well as because 
its value for our emotional life caused it to make a deep 
impression on us. But we do not remember the common 
round of duties done and tasks fulfilled except as a 
pervading feeling of self-satisfaction. 
Such schematic recall is obviously subject to inac- 
curacy. If a variation was not important or striking it 
may be forgotten, and we may believe that no deviation 
ftom routine took place. Here we have one cause of 
the mistakes of memory. What happened is not re- 
called, but assumed as an inference from a general rule 
which in this case did not wholly apply. Or, on the 
other hand, the exceptional is assumed to have been the 
normal. Thus are explained the beliefs of many old 
people that in their childhood all English winters were 
full of snow and frost, and all summers warm and sunny 
—a belief in no way borne out by meteorological records. 
A yet more serious source of error is that, quite 
unconsciously to ourselves, we may colour the events of 
the past and fill in details from imagination, or even 
substitute imaginations for the actual. This may be, 
and often is, also done deliberately. Every case of lying 
about one’s experiences is such a falsification in the
-P-A-G-E-337
318 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
communication of the products of memory. And 
repetition of the false may in time become so familia 
that it is even mistaken for the true. To deceive others 
is a first step towards deceiving ourselves. But so long 
as we know we are falsifying it cannot be said that our 
memory is at fault. Frequently, however, this is really 
the case ; and what is imagined is, quite unintentionally, 
substituted for what should be remembered. Many of 
the false statements of children originate in this way. 
Their imaginations are vivid, and the distinction between 
their images and the real world is not so clear-cut as is 
ours. So they romance in good faith. Of course, habit 
counts here as elsewhere, and the educator is evidently 
called upon to bring home the inaccuracy whenever he 
detects it, and to insist on precision of statement in all 
narratives and descriptions. Such an evil habit a 
exaggeration, to which untrained minds are peculiarly 
liable, should be checked ; for it leads to a failure to 
realize exactly what truth is, and strengthens the tendency 
to make loose statements, which itself reacts on the inner 
life and cultivates loose and inaccurate thinking. 
The belief that a child must surely and easily recall 
anything it has done is, therefore, for all these several 
reasons, devoid of foundation. ‘The ordinary mode in 
which memory works with our past is quite otherwise. 
It is by strengthening and developing appropriate organs 
of knowledge, or habits of thought. In such organs 
the individuality of the acts is lost. Each is absorbed 
in the whole and plays its part in that whole. Repetition 
of an act promotes not the ability to recall the separate 
acts but the power to do the act easily and well. Repeti- 
tion forms habits, and habits are organs of knowledge 
which operate as wholes and in which attention is n0

longer paid to the detailed doing. And this is well. 
Effective life does not consist in re-living the past but 
in grappling with the present. The value to us of our 
past is to make this grappling more successful. So the 
proof of learning is increased ability to do. 
Again, then, we see that facts and separate experiences 
are of value to us not in themselves and as individual 
possessions but as nutriment. “ Personal experiences may 
be forgotten in the sense that we cannot recall them 
individually. They are never forgotten in the sense that 
they leave no trace behind. 
‘When definite personal experiences are recalled the 
recall is in its essence a bringing to mind of certain rela- 
tions between ourselves and some part of our surround- 
ings. This may, or may not, be accompanied by a 
visual image of the event. One person will see a mental 
picture of himself missing the deer and of the animal 
fleeing away. Another will remember his failure just as 
vividly, and yet have no such mental picture or only a 
very vague and blurred one. The event, as an event, 
is remembered with equal clearness in each case. But 
in the former the recall of the scene is undoubtedly more 
particular. The setting of the event stands out dis- 
tinctly, while in the other case this setting is remembered 
only i in the kind of schematic way which can be expressed 
inwords. It may be noted that the former mode of recall 
gives much the greater scope for the confusion of real 
memory with imaginative substitutions. So long as the 
picture as a whole satisfies by its familiarity the details 
are largely accepted as equally certain. | Very detailed 
tecall is not the same thing as very accurate recall.) 
So with the other senses. One musician may recall

-P-A-G-E-339
320 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
in imagination. Another may recall it more as an intel. | 
lectual construction than as an emotional reception, 
though this seems to be less common. 
When a class of children is set to reproduce from 
memory a drawing of something they have already drawn 
in the presence of the object, one child may see the object 
visually and copy his visual picture ; another may repro- 
duce mainly by remembrance of the movements of the | 
hand, and a kind of geometrical grasp of the space 
relations involved. The latter will be unlikely to pro- 
duce as convincing a drawing as the former, because the 
result of his efforts will probably be little more thana 
general schematic sketch of that kind of object. The 
former will present an individual object even though 
some of the details are different from those in the mode, 
So this looks more true to reality, especially when the 
original is not available for comparison. Suchan example 
makes it clear why we tend to be impressed by the apparent 
truth of a statement of past happenings which is marked 
by much consistent detail. Yet some of that detail is 
practically certain to be the product of conscious of 
unconscious imagination. Often even the narrator is 
unable to distinguish between these details and thos 
which are really remembered. / Practically it is much 
safer to trust to our memory that a certain event did 
happen than to trust to our present impression of exactly 
how it happened. / 
The motor memory just spoken of may be trained to 
considerable accuracy within its own general limits. I 
myself, for example, can draw from memory a very fait | 
sketch map of almost any part of the world, though | 
cannot see a mental picture of any kind. This, how- 
ever, has only resulted from much practice in map
-P-A-G-E-340
| LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 321 
drawing in earlier years. If I set myself to draw such 
acommon object as a hen or a horse, I immediately 
become aware how. schematic is my memory ¢ of such 
accuracy their particular features. From my own ex- 
perience I should judge that defect in the power to 
visualize is correlative with a tendency to general rather 
than specific observation. So it comes about that the 
organs of knowledge which enable one to recognize 
one’s surroundings are very general, and one has great 
difficulty in recognizing particular persons or things, 
unless one sees them very frequently, and sometimes 
even then. Dr Edridge-Green records the case of “a 
professional man of exceptional ability? who “fails most 
lamentably to remember names or forms. So great is 
his deficiency... that he is unable to recognize his best 
friends (until they speak). He has got-into an omnibus 
and sat opposite his mother, and thought to himself that 
he seemed to know her face. He has met his brother or 
sister in the street, looked them straight in the face, and 
failed to recognize them. Hie says that he should not 
like to have to identify his wife in a court of law (if he 
had to judge of her by her features), and thinks it 
incredible how a witness can swear to another person. ... 
He has the same difficulty in remembering names, and 
finds the greatest trouble in recollecting them, until they 
become associated with a definite idea or fact.”! This 
extreme case has been a source of comfort to me ever 
Since J first read of it. 
It is evident, then, that the cultivation of distinct 
memories is limited by innate capacity. But it is essenti- 
ally the recall of particulars as such which is affected.

The formation of the all-important organs of knowledge | 
is not, I believe, hindered by such defects as inability to 
visualize. But the power of definite recall of person 
experiences cannot becultivated equally in all individuals, | 
Nor is such a power by itself an unmixed blessing, 
Like a highly developed habit of observing as many 
items as possible in the surroundings, a highly cultivated 
power of recalling the items of the past may positively 
encumber the path of effective thought. As has been 
seen, it is in the pertinence of knowledge to the present 
situation that its value lies. A memory very tenacious 
of details is apt to bring up before the mind eveats 
trivial and important, pertinent and impertinent, just a 
they occurred. Such a perceptual memory is happily 
illustrated in Miss Bates, a character in Jane Austen's 
Emma, Asa fair specimen of her conversation we may 
take the following : 
“Twas so astonished when she first told me 
what she had been saying to Mrs Elton, and when 
Mrs Elton at the same moment came congratulating 
me upon it! It was before tea—stay—no, it could 
not be before tea, because we were just going to cards~ 
and yet it was before tea, because I remember thinking— 
Oh, no, now I recollect, now I have it: something 
happened before tea, but not that. Mr Elton was called 
out of the room before tea, old John Abdy’s son wanted 
to speak with him. Poor old John—I have a great 
regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty- 
seven years; and, now, poor old man, he is bedridden, 
and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints | 
T must go and see him to-day ; and so will Jane, I am 
_ sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John’s son cam 
to talk to Mr Elton about relief from the parish; heis
-P-A-G-E-342
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE 323 
very well-to-do himself, you know, being head man at 
the Crown—ostler, and everything of that sort—but still 
he cannot keep his father without some help; and so, 
when Mr Elton came back, he told us what John ostler 
had been telling him, and then it came out about the 
chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr Frank 
Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened 
before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs 
Elton.” co 
Still worse is the discursive memory which, equally 
trivial in its contents, has not even the merit of keeping 
to the attempt to recollect a definite event. Such recall 
isas unguided by any intelligent purpose as is the most 
vagrant of reveries. It is, indeed, spoken reverie. Per- 
haps the best example of this in fiction is Mrs Nickleby. 
Thus she meanders on: 
“Kate, my dear,’ said Mrs Nickleby ; ‘I don’t know 
how it is, but a fine warm summer day like this, with 
the birds singing in every direction, always puts me in 
mind of roast pig, with sage and onion sauce, and made 
gravy. 
“That’s a curious association of ideas, is it not, mama?? 
“Upon my word, my dear, I don’t know,’ replied Mrs 
Nickleby. ‘Roast pig; let me see. On the day five 
Weeks after you were christened, we had a roast—no, 
that couldn’t have been a pig, either, because I recollect 
there were a pair of them to carve, and your poor papa 
and I could never have thought of sitting down to two 
pigs—they must have been partridges. Roast pig! I 
hardly think we ever could have had one, now I come 
to remember, for your papa could never bear the sight 
of them in the shops, and used to say that they always

put him in mind of very little babies, only the pigs had 
much fairer complexions ; and he had a horror of littl 
babies, too, because he couldn’t very well afford any 
increase to his family, and had a natural dislike to the 
subject. It’s very odd now, what can have put that in 
my head! I recollect dining once at Mrs Bevan’s, in 
that broad street round the corner by the coachmaker’s, 
where the tipsy man fell through the cellar-flap of an 
empty house nearly a week before the quarter-day, and 
wasn’t found till the new tenant went in—and we had 
roast pig there. It must be that, I think, that reminds 
me of it, especially as there was a little bird in the room 
that would keep on singing all the time of dinner—a 
least, not a little bird, for it was a parrot, and he dide’t 
sing exactly, for he talked and swore dreadfully ; but! 
think it must be that. Indeed I am sure it must?”? 
Such memories are by no means uncommon. Indeed, 
when one hears an uneducated person, especially * 
woman, relating a conversation, one notes how frequently 
come the ‘said he? ‘I said? ‘she said.” There is m0 
power to give the gist of what was said, but only to go 
through it in all its pettiness, and that seldom or nevet 
without conscious or unconscious distortion. 
When one considers such memories one sees that they 
simply waste life. The trivialities recalled are not of 
sufficient worth to justify their occupying two spaces of 
time. The first occasion cannot, perhaps, be avoided; 
the second can. Doubtless, too, the indulgence in this 
kind of reminiscence strengthens the tendency to bt 
interested in the infinitesimally unimportant and 0 ! 
neglect any meaning of things which does not lie on tht 
surface.

The great truth which such considerations bring home 
tous is, it seems to me, the value and the blessedness of 
forgetting. Very few of our past experiences are worth 
recalling as such; their true legacy is in our increased 
power. 
Yet forgetting is not wholly in our power. That 
fact, too, has a value for life. For the things which we - 
find it quite impossible to forget are generally those 
which stand as warnings and sign-posts to direct us on 
our way. They are the experiences which had a strong 
emotional effect upon us at the time, and this usually 
means that they had an important bearing on our lives. 
The one common characteristic.of the personal experi- 
ences which each one of us remembersisseenhere. They 
ae all experiences which intensely interested us in some 
way—often a very unpleasant way. This is, of course, 
only a special case of the rule which finds its most general 
application in the fact that we advance best in the know- 
ledge of what interests us. The general experiences in 
an interesting activity grow together into the strong 
common tendency or aptitude; the exceptionally vivid 
ones not only affect this but gain a kind of more or less 
permanent independence of their own. What one is 
interested in one observes and attends to; consequently 
one remembers it more or less distinctly for a longer or 
shorter time. 
In the course of life we have many interesting experi- 
ences, and they are not all of one type. Naturally we 
recall at any moment those which agree most closely with 
the dominant note of our intellectual life at the present.

such reminiscences will stand more or less explicitly and 
clearly before me. ‘This means that the mental life iss 
far organized that experiences relating to the same kind 
of topic have become connected together. The mor 
perfect the organization, therefore, the more fruitful wil 
be the effort to recall. Such organization can, however, 
only come from attentive study of the relations which 
exist between the cognate items of experience. So we 
see again that power of pertinent recall is not only atten- 
tion-working-in a definite sphere at the present, but that 
it-also-implies_a_previous-synthesis of the contents of 
that sphere in the past... 
gS important is the influence of emotional tone 
~ in determining the kitid of experiences recalled. If 1 
am joyous I naturally dwell on reminiscences of past 
happiness ; if I am sad I with equal facility revive my 
former sorrows. In either case it would be practically 
impossible to recall the other class of experiences: their 
emotional nature is incompatible with the preseat 
emotional tone, and they can enter consciousness only if 
that tone be changed. ‘True, when I am sorrowful | 
may remember that at former times I have been glad, 
but this is not recalled as gladness, but rather by contrast 
to deepen the present grief. So, too, events in them 
selves indifferent may be given a very definite emotional 
colour if they be recalled in a state of violent passion, 
such as jealousy, anger, or love. ; 
It follows that my power of recalling my past exper 
ences depends on my mental preoccupation and on af 
emotional tone. What I can recall at one time J cannot 
recall at another. ‘‘ The memory has as many moods 
the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama.”'

Moreover, as my interests differ from those of others, 
so the kinds of things I naturally remember are those 
another will equally naturally forget. “‘Let four men

ments, door- and window-fastenings, and other useful

so wrapped in his own subjective broodings as to tell 
little more than a few names of places through which he 
passed. Each has selected, out of the same mass of 
presented objects, those which suited his private interest 
and has made his experience thereby.”? 
It is now plain how much it obscures the facts to speak 
of memory as if it were an independent power, able 
to deal equally well and quite mechanically with any- 
thing entrusted to it, and only needing to be exer- 
cised in any one department of learning to grow strong 
for all. We all have many memories, even in reference 
to our own personal lives, and some of these are stronger 
than others : we all remember some kinds of experience 
better than others. , “But memory is nothing mysterious. 
It is simply attention directed to the past, and, like atten= 
tion directed to the present, it works in the sphere of 
Itis evident, then, that to deepen i interest i is to improve 
memory for that in which the interest is felt. Further, 
it has been seen that the mere memory of facts, with no

selection on grounds of importance or pertinence, and 
with no systematization according to their bearing on 
each other and on the occasion which calls them forth, is 
of very small value at any time, and far more often isa 
positive hindrance to effective thought or action. 
_The training of the memory is, therefore, essentially 
a __atraining. jn power of | synthesis and of seeing relations of 
“worth and pertinence. To practise children in giving 
detailed relations of their experiences—as in the ridicul- 
ous proposal I once saw that every day they should be 
asked to enumerate in detailed sequence the things and 
persons they had passed on their way to school—is to 
take a very certain way of equipping them with the 
worst possible mental habits both of attention to the 
present and of making use of the past. On the con- 
trary, everything which exercises them in judicious 
selection, rejection, and arrangement of their remem- 
bered experiences round certain topics, is of value; for 
it really trains the mind in that critical power of dealing 
with its thoughts which is the very essence of good 
judgement and which, like other mental powers, with 
wise practice becomes largely automatic. 
At the same time it should be borne in mind by every 
teacher that only so far as a past experience is helpful for 
the present situation is it worth recalling, and that the 
gteat majority of such experiences do their appropriate 
service without enjoying an individual immortality.

CHAPTER X 
LEARNING THROUGH COMMUNICATED EXPERIENCE _ 
Tue very meaning of education is that the young should 
profit by the wisdom, knowledge, and experience of 
their elders, and the chief function of schools is to make 
that profit as great as possible. The fact that we are by 
nature social and are all born into a social environment 
would by itself ensure that we are helped by others in 
the guidance of our lives. Our innate sociability 
prompts us to assimilate our conduct to theirs, to accept 
their views, and generally to mould ourselves upon 
them. 
The very learning to speak is at the same time a 
leaning of the thoughts of those around us. Even 
words imply classifications of the objects of experience, 
and we learn speech not in words but in statements, 
commands, directions, and expressions of approval and 
disapproval. So the child accepts the jhdgements of 
value on things and acts which are current in his little 
circle, and learns to regulate his doings not only by 
explicit directions and prohibitions but through -the 
description of acts as right or wrong, good or naughty. 
He learns too, with equal unconsciousness, many of the 
more common relations of familiar things to each other 
and to himself. He is warned that fire burns, and that.
-P-A-G-E-349
330 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
he must not simply avoid touching it but must refrain 
from putting many things in close neighbourhood to it; 
that clothes may be torn and spoilt by spilling ink upon 
them ; that porcelain is breakable. No doubt personal 
experience would bring most or all of these home to him 
in particular cases, but the instructions and prohibitions 
of his elders accelerate such learning as well as make it 
more definite. 
There is, then, much informal learning from others 
going on from almost the beginning of life, just as there 
is much informal learning by personal experience. The 
two often unite, as when a direction to do, or to refrain 
from doing, both regulates personal experience and adds 
to it a reason based on the knowledge of others of some 
relation that has not yet come into that experience. 
Such communicated knowledge, however, deals with 
the child’s immediate environment, and, consequently 
rather deepens the knowledge given by personal experi- 
ence than extends its scope. Yet the direct surroundings 
of every one are so limited, while the assumptions of 
knowledge in ordinary civilized life are so extended, 
that the young can only be fitted to take their part i 
such a life if the range of their knowledge be extended. 
To live effectively we must profit by the experiences of 
our forefathers and by ‘the wisdom of our contem- 
poraries. Life is not merely here and now. For each 
one of us is a fuller life of the spirit, and unless to some 
extent we enter into that we cannot share the best the 
world can offer us, nor can we realize our own possibilities 
This wider experience, however, must be made ou 
own, or it profits nothing. Merely to learn statements 
of what has been done or thought in the world, and 
never so to take them into our own thought and feelings
-P-A-G-E-350
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 331 
and aspirations that they help us to judge more justly 
and more correctly in the situations of actual life is 
worthless. The accumulation of a mass of such dead 
bones of information may be erudition but, though it is 
commonly called ‘knowledge’, it is not knowledge in 
the true sense of a living factor in the guidance of life. 
Its outcome is pedantry, not wisdom. Communicated 
experience and knowledge must be made our own 
experience as fully as it is possible so to assimilate it. It 
becomes ours only when in imagination and thought we 
ourselves live through the experience, or reconstruct the 
edifice of knowledge. It shows its value, just as does 
direct experience, in an increased power to deal with 
actual situations of life of whatever character they may 
be, not in the ability to repeat in words an account of it. 
We learn—or we should learn—in order to increase our 
wisdom in the conduct of our lives and in the taking 
of our proper share in the social life around us, not that 
we may lay out in order the skeletons of the past. “Can 
these dead bones live??? must be answerable in the 
affirmative if the ‘‘dead bones” are to justify their 
inclusion in what is taught to the young. “Best of 
all is he’ said Hesiod, ‘‘who is wise by his own wit ; 
next best is he who is wise by the wit of others; but 
whoso is neither able to see, nor willing to hear, he is a 
good-for-nothing fellow.” 
“Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for 
ability”. So does Bacon begin his well-known essay. 
For the purposes of education we may omit the second” 
heading. The time of youth is too short and too valu- 
able to be spent in acquiring that which adds to neither 
the joy nor the usefulness of life. But each of the two 
other considerations should be remembered, or. the
-P-A-G-E-351
332 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
education will deform and narrow the expanding life. 
Together they demand the inclusion of as much as time 
permits to be attempted; they leave no leisure for 
learning the worthless. 
This has always been one of the chief stumbling-blocks 
of schools. We have already seen that in giving oppor- 
tunity for guided personal experience schools have often 
not done all that it is reasonable to demand of them. 
Too often, indeed, they have done nothing, but have 
confined themselves to communicating statements of the 
knowledge of others. The selection has been deter- 
mined by custom and tradition, and supported by argu- 
ments directed to a pre-determined end and not to an 
investigation of what that end should be. Historically. 
the concentration of schools upon the teaching of Latin 
was due to the simple fact that Latin was the common 
language of cultivated Europe, so that in teaching it 
the schools trained a capacity which was of immediate 
and first-rate importance in the lives of all who to any 
degree would engage in scholarly pursuits or retain 
scholarly interests. Under those conditions the teaching 
of Latin was abundantly justified, and its obvious beat- 
ing on life seems to have secured that a large number 
of school-boys really attained a fair mastery of the 
language. But the classical curriculum was maintained 
long after Latin as the language of culture had been 
supplanted by the various modern languages. At first 
this was merely the inertia of school tradition, but when 
it was challenged arguments in its favour were sought 
from the faculty hypothesis of psychology, and it was 
urged that the classical languages were unrivalled instru- 
ments for training the intellectual powers. Yet it could 
not be denied that this hypothetical value was invisible
-P-A-G-E-352
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 333 
to the vast majority of boys, and that, with the exception 
of those who had a special aptitude for such studies, or 
who saw in them the road to academical distinction— 
and these two incentives generally coincided—they 
studied Latin with so little enthusiasm that they certainly 
did not derive the expected benefits. It was impossible 
to deny the truth of the picture Huxley drew some forty 
years ago: “‘It means...that after a dozen years spent 
at this kind of work, the sufferer shall be incompetent 
to interpret a passage in an author he has not already 
got up; that he shall loathe the sight of a Greek or 
Latin book ; and that he shall never open, or think of, 
a classical writer again, until, wonderful to relate, he 
insists upon submitting his sons to the same process.” * 
The knowledge the schools attempted to communicate 
did not enter into the intellectual life-blood of most of 
their pupils, among whom there consequently arose the 
idea not only that the school life outsidé the class-room 
was very important but that it was practically the only 
important part of the school. Indeed, for a great many 
of them this was absolutely true, simply because the work 
of the class-room did not enter their real lives at all, for it 
aroused neither interest nor desire. 
Itis not merely a matter of subject however. Schools 
innocent of classics may equally fail to lead their pupils 
into wisdom through the gate of knowledge. The root 
of the mischief is always the same. ‘It is that ‘‘in this 
world the gift is valued according to the standard of the 
teceiver—not according to the standard of the giver; 
men judge us not by effort, but by result. It is not 
what a thing has cost, but what a thing will fetch, that 
decides its market-price ; it is the scored success, and 
VEssay on 4 Liberal Education and Where to Find it,

334 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
not the secret struggle, that wins the crown.”? In 
harmony with this general method of estimation, we 
seek the results of teaching in the wrong place and 
in the wrong way. The school loves examinations, and 
examinations mainly appeal to memory of verbal state- 
ments. If what has been told is reproduced as nearly 
as possible in the same form, then the actual—f 
unavowed—scholastic aim is too often attained. The 
greater the mass of such reproductions the more dis 
tinguished the scholar. Still in our own days the 
complaint of Montaigne is too often justified: “We 
only toil and labour to stuff the memory and in the mean 
time leave the conscience and the understanding unfur- 
nished and void.”? Yet it is only so far as learning does 
enter into the conscience and the understanding that it 
becomes part of the experience of the scholar, and so 
is of value to him in life. 
Happily an improvement is everywhere visible, but 
reform has to struggle against the scholastic conscien- 
tiousness which rightly desires thorough work and which 
is unable to cut itself adrift from the traditional tests of 
thoroughness. 
No one can pretend that the test of value for efficiency 
in life is an easy one to apply in selecting matter for 
instruction or in determining the method of teaching. 
On the other hand, no one can doubt that if it be con- 
scientiously applied the result will be a wiser and better 
one than if subjects or facts are taught as a matter of 
course, simply because they have hitherto been taught. 
So, too, if the same test be applied to method of learning, 
and if it be kept in mind that it is the learning which 
4 Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler : Kate of Kate Hall, ch. 18.

-P-A-G-E-354
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 335 
is of primary importance, and that the teaching is 
important only so far as it determines the learning, then 
there is greater hope that the test of success may be 
placed in the increase of aptitude, not in the amassing 
of intellectual lumber. 
Astudy of the mental process involved in assimilating 
knowledge communicated by others should be helpful 
to the teacher who desires that the learning of his pupils 
shall be real and fruitful. It will not by itself decide 
what they shall be set to learn: that involves considera- 
tion of their interests in relation to the requirements of 
their lives. But it will throw light on how they must 
learn if the learning is to result in true spiritual growth. 
In understanding the possibility of one entering into 
the experiences of another we may, perhaps, find a 
starting-point in the fact that quite instinctively a child 
implicitly assumes the existence of familiar people and 
things when they are removed from direct experience. 
He may picture his mother as doing this or that though 
he does not see her: he assumes that his toys will still 
be found where he left them. These implicit assump- 
tions are made because only by assimilating the existence 
of others to his own continuous conscious existence can 
he understand it. Without conscious thought, then, 
personal experience is from the first a key to the experi- 
ence of others. So, too, a child learns to read approval 
or disapproval, joy or sorrow, encouragement or anger, 
in his mother’s face, partly because he himself instinc- 
tively shows such emotions by similar modes of expres- 
sion, but mainly because those signs of her attitude 
towards him do not stand alone, but are always parts 
of fuller dealings with him which as a whole make the 
situation quite clear. ‘The former factor is implicit: the
-P-A-G-E-355
336 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
latter is more or less explicit, but with a tendency to 
become implicit and immediate. As experience of 
emotional attitudes grows the child more and more takes 
for granted the meaning of the earliest signs say of 
displeasure or disapproval, and he shows his under- 
standing by the regulation of his behaviour. 
An excellent example of how accurate and complex 
such interpretation of the outward actions of others may 
be without the intervention of speech is found in those 
plays in dumb show—such as L’ enfant prodigue—which 
a few years ago were generally popular. By clever acting 
the whole story was made plain without a single word 
being spoken, and that not only as a series of events but 
as an emotional drama. A well-acted charade provides 
a simpler example of a somewhat similar character. 
Such a drama would be unintelligible to a savage from 
Western Africa, simply because it depicts a life out of 
relation with his own experience, and emotional values 
to which he is a stranger. Similarly, a religious dance 
of savages appeals to those among whom it is one of 
the highest forms of emotional expression in a very 
different way from that in which it appeals to a European. 
Even if speech be added, no matter how frank and 
straightforward it may be, the difficulty still remains 
We cannot enter into the feelings and thoughts of the 
savage, nor he into ours, simply because our whole lives 
have been different from his. And because he and we 
cannot enter into each other’s feelings we cannot interpret 
each other’s mimetic art. 
Probably the next step in the representation of ex 
perience is found in pictorial art. It needs no words 
to prove that the same picture means very different 
things to different minds. This implies that different
-P-A-G-E-356
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 337 
minds bring to its apprehension very different systems of 
evaluated knowledge ; for the mere sense impressions 
are the same for all who can perceive them. It is needful 
to add this saving clause, for the very seeing is a matter 
of understanding and insight. A simple example of 
this is any ‘puzzle picture’. When we have found the 
hidden object it stands out clearly, but we may have 
looked long before we found it at all. So on a higher 
plane, there are often parts and details of a picture which 
take a very new and often a very suggestive significance 
as the meaning of the composition guides our study. In 
truth, we come to see what before we did not see. The 
lines and colours combine into previously unseen rela- 
tions, giving a wider and deeper value to the whole. 
True as this is even of what appeals directly to sight 
it is yet more true of all that the seen means to us 
emotionally and spiritually. According to the wealth 
and depth of our experience are we able to use the picture 
a a bridge of communication between our own soul 
and that of the artist. Show a child of six such a picture 
a Millet’s ‘ Angelus’ and he will see in it a man and a 
woman, a wheelbarrow, a basket and a fork. Probably 
he will enumerate all these: perhaps only the man, the 
woman, and the wheel-barrow. That is all the picture 
Means to him. A child of twelve will give a fuller 
description of the visible features represented. He will 
see the field, will note the dress, attitudes, and relative 
Positions of the figures ; he may remark that it is sunset. 
He may possibly notice the colour-tone of the whole. 
Further than this the ordinary child will not go: further 
than this many an adult cannot advance. But to the 
seing eye the picture means much more than this; 
indeed, it does not mean this at all. It means simple-

-P-A-G-E-357
338 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
hearted devotion sweetening arduous and humble toil; 
it means all the glorious spiritual richness of Christianity, 
If we consider examples of less obvious art, such as 
Watts’ ‘Love and Death’, or still more, his ‘Hope’, we 
see even more clearly how much the meaning they have 
for us depends on the spiritual experience, the living in- 
sight, we bring to the contemplation of them. It may 
be that the language of the artist is unfamiliar to us; then 
we misinterpret. Many people, for instance, can find 
nothing but bad drawing and worse anatomy in mediaeval 
pictures or painted windows, not understanding that the 
figures were not intended to be copies of nature but 
symbols of spiritual qualities. Once that key is really 
seized the richness of spiritual experience suggested 
becomes more and more evident. 
The greatness of a picture consists above all in its 
wealth of spiritual suggestion. But only when the 
meaning conveyed is the direct expression of the spiritual 
life of the artist does it appeal to the soul of another 
When it is merely the setting forth of a conventional 
idea, or the representation of a borrowed thought, it 
leaves us cold and untouched, no matter how great 4 
technical skill it may display. It cannot connect soul 
with soul because it did not originate in soul. Whe 
the thought burns for expression it finds it in the most 
direct and simple means. If one compares, for example, 
the ‘Death of St Francis’ of Giotto with the treatment 
of the same subject by Domenico Ghirlandaio one sé 
how simply and directly, yet how powerfully, Giotto 
brings home to one the emotional value of the scene- 
the sorrow, not devoid of hope, of the disciples, the 
calm trust of the dying saint. The later -painte, 
obviously taking his inspiration at second-hand from tle
-P-A-G-E-358
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 339 
earlier—for the general composition of the picture is the 
same—has no such clear and direct spiritual meaning to 
convey. One feels that he paints his fresco for adorn- 
ment, and so he overloads it with ornamental accessories 
so incompatible with the scene that they not only distract 
the attention but positively hinder, if they do not render 
impossible, any such emotional effect as Giotto so surely 
attains. 
A picture may, of course, give simple sensuous 
enjoyment by its beauty of line and colour, but if it 
mean no more than this to us it is on the level of a sweet 
smell or an exquisite wine. Great art does mean’ more 
to the artist: it expresses his soul. So it means more 
to him who has the seeing eye and the understanding 
heart. This is not to say that art is necessarily didactic. 
That implies the suggestion of a message more or less 
foreign to itself. It degrades art from being the direct 
&xpression and interpretation of life to being a mere 
channel for another’s dogmas. 
When we consider how little there is in a picture 
looked at merely as a coloured surface, and how much of 
spiritual meaning it may have for him who can read it, 
the great and fundamental principle of all learning from 
others is made abundantly manifest—that such learning 
is proportioned to our power to find an interpretative 
meaning within ourselves, a meaning which will ever 
after be richer for this experience. 
It is evident that children and boys and girls cannot 
tnter far into the meaning of art. As contemplative 
poetry bores and repels them so they turn away from 
all but obvious pictures. Yet unless they begin with 
simple works of art which are easily grasped and inter- 
preted they can never develop that insight and power of
-P-A-G-E-359
340 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
interpretation which will open to them the more hidden 
recesses. Certainly, the mere study of pictures will not 
do this, but only life in all its fullness. As no one can 
become a great artist who has lived a starved life, so no 
one can fee] the depth of meaning of great art whos 
outlook and experience have been narrow or sordid. 
It is of no use to tell another what to admire. Yet 
children may be tactfully led to feel art by a teacher who 
has the real spirit within him. Always largely true, 
here it seems to me to be wholly true, that ‘‘ one’s power 
of teaching increases not by teaching but by learning”’ 
All will not feel art equally : many, perhaps, but slightly. 
Yet to awaken even a glimmer of inner light is worth 
doing: without it one great realm of spiritual life is for 
ever unexplored. 
Art, however, because of its very intimateness is 
strikingly personal in its appeal. It adds to the joy and 
beauty of life; it extends the sympathies by making us 
capable of truer and fuller feeling ; it ennoblesand vivities 
the springs of conduct. Ina way it makes us understand 
more truly both our fellows and the world of natur, 
because understanding is always as much of the heat 
as of the head. But it does not directly give knowledge 
in the ordinary intellectual sense of that word. That 
the function of language, which is, before all else, 4 
means of communication. On that the school must 
always largely rely, though it will not educate well unles 
it avoid that exaggeration of the function of langugt 
of which mention was made in the last chapter. 
Into the earliest development of language in childhood 
Ido not propose to enter. It has been traced with great 
care in several monographs on the psychology of infanch 
VE. F. Benson: The Challoners, ch, 5.
-P-A-G-E-360
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 341 
and it is mot necessary to recapitulate the: results. 
Details are of value to us only as indicating and throwing 
light upon the general form of the process of learning 
both to understand and to use speech. Of course, that 
form is the same throughout life: it is the filling which 
grows in richness and fullness. 
It should first be noted that speech is not only a means 
of communicating a knowledge of the experiences of 
one to another, but it is also a direct experience of the 
latter. When a child hears words he has a perceptual 
experience ; when he tries to utter words he is attempt- 
ing to do what he hears others do. Psychologically, 
then, there is nothing exceptional about language. 
Advance in the understanding of it is only one form in 
which perceptual knowledge grows. That form has 
been seen to be a gradual accumulation of meaning 
which leads us not only to recognize but to understand 
the perceived object. We saw also that this meaning 
does not appear in consciousness separate from the thing 
tecognized, but is a latent expectation of what, by 
appropriate acts, we could bring into direct perception. 
Further, it was pointed out that perceptual activity deals 
not with single things in isolation, but with chains of 
acts dealing with many things successively. ‘The separa- 
tion of things and the recognition of each as having: 
an existence of its own is an act of perceptual analysis. 
lastly, we saw that when these perceptual objects are 
examined in themselves and in the relations to other 
things which make them what they are, our thought 
becomes conceptual ; but that this is only making explicit 
the meaning which was hitherto implicit, and without 
which no recognition or naming of objects would have 
been possible.
-P-A-G-E-361
342 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
Every word of this applies to the learning of speech, 
Little by little the child separates out words from con- 
tinuous speech. The same sound, with the same general 
reference, occurs again and again, and so gradually gets 
an independent existence of its own—that is, a meaning 
of its own, though that meaning is not thought by itself 
but only enters with other similar elements to form the 
general meaning which the whole speech has for him, 
He thus learns to recognize before he can produce, just 
as in all other modes of knowing and doing. For the 
former involves only one form of growing skill; the 
latter adds to that a further and more difficult form, in 
that to recognize is always easier than to produce. We 
see the same throughout life and in every department 
of activity: our ideas are in advance of our doings, or 
our doings themselves are poor stuff. ‘‘Do as I say, 
not as I do” is usually excellent advice, for we can all 
see, at any rate in imagination, something better than 
our own performances. In language in particular we 
know that the vocabulary we use in speech or writing 
is always less extensive than the vocabulary we can 
understand. Perhaps this is brought home to us most 
clearly when we apply the test to a foreign language. 
We find that we can read it much better than we can 
speak it. 
A child’s earliest speech names his own desires and 
actions and the things with which these are concerned. At 
first the name is no more separated from the thing in his 
mind than are such qualities as taste, colour, or texture. 
Often, his single-word utterances express more that 
mere recognition. With the child, as with the adult, 
words are but a part of vocal expression, and ought not 
to be separated from the tone of voice and generd
-P-A-G-E-362
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 343 
manner of utterance, or from the actual circumstances 
which call them forth. A single word may express a 
variety of mental attitudes towards the thing named. 
This is also true of interpretation of the speech of others. 
The mother’s tone of voice expresses approval or dis- 
approval, encouragement or prohibition, as surely as do 
her words; yea, more surely, for a very young child 
knows when his mother is pretending to be fierce towards 
him in play, no matter what may be her words. The 
beautifully natural modulations of the speech of a young 
boy or girl show what a large part mode of utterance 
plays in the expression through speech of thought, of 
emotion, of wish. 
Words are, however, general in their reference, and 
as experience of things widens this generality comes 
more and more to the front. With the use of such 
qualifying words as adjectives and adverbs we have 
evidence of the beginnings of conceptual thought, for 
they indicate that a quality can be given a meaning apart 
from that of which it is a quality. The more difficult 
words expressive of relation are naturally the last a child 
acquires, because relations of thing to thing are not 
directly given to sense observation, but are interpreta- 
tions of what is so given. The child, for example, sees 
a ball lying under a chair. The use of a preposition 
implies that this spatial relation has itself been made the 
object of attention. 
More and more as speech is acquired the reference is 
feed from the immediate surroundings of the: child. 
He can ask for what he desires, though he sees it not. 
Here is a distinct step in advance of asking for it when 
he sees it, for it involves a recall in memory of the desired 
object, arecall which both centres round, and finds expres-
-P-A-G-E-363
344 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
sion in, its name. But he can also understand statements 
about things which are not present to him. What goes 
on in his mind when this happens? We will say thata 
child is told that his dog has been out for a walk. He 
hears the words one by one, yet the meaning is nota 
combination of as many separate meanings as there are 
words, The first words raise in his mind his idea of 
the dog with an expectation more or less vague which 
the other words fill out and make definite. At each step 
the initial idea grows in explicitness of meaning. The 
child has no need to wait till he has separately got ideas 
of dog, going out, and walk, and then to fasten them 
together. It is the dog-idea taking a specific form under 
the guidance of the communication. Now, evidently 
this is possible only so long as the descriptive words have 
meaning for the child. If he were told that the dog is 
a quadruped of the genus canis, the expectation raised 
by ‘dog? would be balked; the words would convey 
nothing to him except that something was said about 
his friend the dog. 
We have, then, two points: that the meanings of 
words in speech do not arise separately in the hearer’s 
mind, and that only words which have gained meaning 
from past experience can evoke response. 
The latter of these two points is easily granted ; the 
former is obscured by the fact that we are so used to the 
separation of words on the printed page that we think 
of them as separate constituents of speech. Yet histori- 
cally speech ante-dated words, and even in writing 
separation into words was at first unknown. There was 
no such separation, for instance, in early Greek manu- 
scripts. Further, earlier languages expressed by what 
were written as single words many ideas which a modert
-P-A-G-E-364
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 345 
hnguage uses several words to express. All the 
inflexions of Greek and Latin are cases in point. 
So it is not true that the word is the unit of speech. 
Speech means the expression of thought, and that as.a 
rule requires several words even when the thought is a 
simple one. We saw that in analysing an object of 
perception the object is yet held in the mind as a whole: 
whatever quality or relation is attended to, there is 
implicit in the thought the unity of the object... More- 
over, though no analysis exhausts it, yet we do not lose 
any of the object, no matter how inadequate our analysis 
may be. 
Exactly the converse is true of constructing a meaning. 
The enumeration of elements is never complete, and yet 
the idea raised is of a complete object, because the words 
used do not stand simply each for one naked element, 
but each is a suggestion of the meaning of a whole, to 
which every added qualification gives precision. If, for 
example, I hear or read the words ‘The king raised in 
his hand a heavy golden cup richly set with jewels’, the 
meaning starts with ‘king’ and an expectation which is 
given definiteness by the word ‘raised’, a definiteness 
increasing with each added word. My idea grows in 
clearness little by little: it is not built up at the end. 
Indeed, it is evident that ‘heavy’, ‘golden’, ‘richly set 
with jewels’ cannot be thought apart from something 
of which they are the qualities. 
This is the process in all interpretation of speech— 
the giving increasing precision to an indefinite whole. 
All that has been said gives meaning to what is being 
said, and at the end we have a systematic whole of mean- 
ing, not a series of meanings like beads ona’ string. 
The proof that we have assimilated the earlier steps is
-P-A-G-E-365
346 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
our increased power of assimilating the latter. Then, 
indeed, we have made the communicated knowledge pat 
of our own thought-experience, for we use it to interpret 
other presented ideas. 
Several suggestions as to teaching here offer them 
selves. The first is that the presentation of the matter 
the pupils are to learn should be systematic in arrange. 
ment, and given at such a rate as to keep intellectual 
effort on the stretch, and yet allow time for each new 
element to be received into the growing whole of mea 
ing. Another is that to require pupils to repeat ina 
series the various ideas or facts which have been told 
them is to take to pieces again the mental construction 
which the whole teaching should aim at securing. 
Worse still, evidently, is the common plan of the teacher 
taking it to pieces himself and asking various pupils to 
pick up a stone here and a balk there, with the result 
that all which remains is a heap of mental débris, The 
true test of successful teaching is the increased power 
to deal with similar matter, and that should be tested 
by the amount of intelligent anticipation during the 
exposition itself and by giving similar matter to be deal 
with. Learning should develop intelligence, and to this 
remembering is auxiliary. But remembering here, s 
in the case of personal experience, by no means nects 
sarily implies recall of individual items. 
We must now face the fundamental question of 
communication—how is it possible to give new know- 
ledge though we are understood only when our spect! 
__ raises in our hearers’ minds meaning derived from thei 
own experience? The answer is to be found in a cor 
sideration of that very generality of words which bas 
been signalled as the chief characteristic of the acquit

LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 347 
ment of spéech. A child may never have seen a king 
ora golden jewelled cup. Yet he has heard of kings, 
and has doubtless seen pictures of them. Probably 
while he is young he imagines them as always wearing 
a crown and clothed in gorgeous, if inconvenient, robes. 
As he grows older that meaning will be rectified. For 
our present purpose it does not matter whether the king 
isso thought or no, except that with a young child any- 
thing which makes the idea vivid is to be welcomed. 
So, too, the child has had experience of raising things 
in general and cups in particular: he knows gold, and 
he has probably seen jewels. If he has not, that part 
of the meaning will remain dim to him till he does see 
some gems. Every element, then, is familiar to him, 
and as he has learnt that ‘golden’ may be a quality of 
many things he is ready to imagine a golden cup, even 
though he has never seen one. From familiar elements 
a new compound has been formed. Here again it 
should be noted that we have no new form of mental 
process. It is only a special case of the general rule 
that new knowledge grows out of old acquisitions. 
The most elaborate new mental constructions we can 
make are subject to exactly the same conditions. Unless 
the elements are known the combination cannot be made. 
Of course, this also is a progressive achievement. Every 
new combination is a possible element in a further com- 
pound. Just as in the acquisition of some form of 
bodily skill the mastery of one simple combination of 
movements makes possible the acquisition of a more 
complex combination, so it is with that increasing skill _ 
in knowing which we call intelligence. Intelligence is 
the functioning of past acquirement in the presence of 
anew situation, that past acquirement being, of course,
-P-A-G-E-367
348 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
the present form of an individual human capacity and 
not a piece of lifeless mechanism. 
We all know from our experience both as teachers 
and as learners that the great drawback to knowledge 
received at second-hand is that it is too often wanting in 
_vividness and clearness. There are many reasons for 
this, of which the two most important are want of interest 
in the subject and poverty in the meanings attached to 
the speech. The want of interest may be in the teacher; 
then assuredly it will be reflected in the class. We are 
too apt to forget that teaching is the contact of mind 
with mind, and that all such contact which is alive and 
enlivening is emotional as well as intellectual. A mere 
cold and bloodless presentation of almost any matter will 
make it dry and repellent to children. Even adults have 
been known to condemn sermon or lecture as tedious, 
although its matter if differently presented might have 
roused them almost, if not quite, to enthusiasm. With 
young boys and girls, lack of enthusiasm on the part of 
the teacher is the most frequent cause of intellectual 
‘inertness on the side of the scholars. Older boys and 
girls, no doubt, require, in addition to stimulating teach 
ing, to see some value in what they are asked to lean 
before they will throw themselves into it with energy. 
Closely connected with want of interest is poverty of 
meaning. This also is often due to a faulty presentation, 
especially in oral teaching. Words are abstract, and ia 
teaching we want them to suggest concretes. Evidently 
if the teacher’s exposition be couched in general terms 
the concretes called up will be sketchy and thin in meat 
ing. If a scene or an event is being described the mor 
particular the words used the more definite the meanings 
they evoke. ‘The king raised a cup’, for instant,
-P-A-G-E-368

LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 349 _ 
cannot mean as much as ‘ The king raised a heavy golden 
cup richly set with jewels’. It is detail which makes a 
mental construction clear and precise. And to give 
appropriate and effective detail presupposes very con- 
siderable knowledge of the subject on the part of the 
teacher. But this does not mean verbosity. It is quite 
easy to bury the whole under a mass of detail, like the 
fresco of Ghirlandaio to which reference has already been 
made. How simple yet how adequate is Tennyson’s 
description— 
“a chapel nigh the field, 
A broken chancel with a broken cross, 
That stood on a dark strait of barren land: 
On one side lay the Ocean, and on one 
Lay a great water, and the moon was full.”* 
Yet the clearest and most precise exposition will fail 
if the experiences of the children, including all they have 
really learnt and thought through the instruction of 
others, do not supply full and accurate meanings. This 
shows that neglect of the guidance of direct active experi- 
ence by schools is a misfortune not only on account of its 
limitation of the children’s lives but even in relation to 
that very intellectual culture for the sake of which it is 
put out of court. To name a cornfield to a child who 
has never been in the country, or a storm at sea to one 
who has never seen the sea, is to utter words which 
aise in the minds of the hearers but vague ghosts of 
meanings. Even with the most vivid verbal descriptions 
assisted by good pictures the significance of the words 
must fall far short of a remembrance of the actual 
experience. Perhaps the greatest difficulty in teaching 
young children is that teacher and taught almost speak 
1 The Passing of Arthur. :
-P-A-G-E-369
350 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
different languages, for though they use the same words 
the meanings implied are far from being the same, 
One can never give good oral teaching till one has 
mastered with approximate accuracy the real speech of 
one’s pupils, so that one knows what kinds of meanings 
one’s words will call up in their minds. Then only can 
one set oneself deliberately to develop those meanings by 
inducing in the children either direct experiences ora 
living in imagination through the experiences needed. 
To live in imagination often carries with it the seeing 
in a series of mental pictures of the things or events 
described. In this case greater vividness is secured 
than when such visual pictures are absent or are obscure 
and blurred. It is probable that the young have usually 
some power of visualizing, though it is by no means as 
general as is sometimes assumed that the pictures are 
sufficiently clear and definite to be of much value. Of 
course, those who visualize their memories of their own 
past experiences will also visualize the scenes they con- 
struct mentally under the guidance of descriptions, 
whether heard or read. In such visualizing there is the 
same general process that has been already discussed 
under meaning. The picture, like the meaning, begins 
by being vague, and gradually gains in definiteness and 
clearness as the description proceeds. It is like a land- 
scape coming into view as the sun dissolves the morning 
mist. There are not imaged in succession a number of 
qualities which are afterwards fitted together like the 
pieces of a Chinese puzzle. Whatever results in out 
minds from hearing a description, then, is from the firsta 
form of apprehending the whole, which is filled out, and 
it may be modified, as the guiding speech goes on. 
Pictures add vividness to meaning, but they are not
-P-A-G-E-370
  LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 351 
themselves meaning. They play in communicated ex- 
perience a part analogous to that which direct presenta- 
tion to sight plays in personal experience. To be familiar 
by sight with an object does not guarantee that we know 
much about it, and even when it enters into some 
perceptual activity it does so in its meaning for that 
activity. In climbing, for instance, the sight of a ledge 
or a projecting stone suggests to us that it will, or will 
not, support our weight, and on that meaning we act. 
The seen qualities are not attended to in themselves, but 
simply as indicating firmness or looseness. On the other 
hand, when we come to conceptual analysis the seen object 
is regarded primarily as a bundle of examples of general 
qualities and laws ; that is, each seen quality is a cue to 
aline of thought and a suggestion of a general and far- 
teaching meaning. 
Everybody seems ready to grant that objects of per- 
ception are not our thoughts of them. Yet many con- 
fuse visual images, which are only copies of objects as 
seen, with thoughts or meanings. In truth, like their 
originals, such images are merely pegs round which 
meanings cluster, and cues which prompt us to think 
those meanings. Some people, it appears, cannot get 
the meanings clear without the images. George Mere- 
dith depicts a common type of mind, especially among 
women, when he says of Cecilia Halkett: ‘‘A political 
exposition devoid of imagery was given to her next 
day...when it was only by mentally translating it into 
imagery that she could advance a step beside her intel- 
lectual guide”! But it is obvious that unless the 
abstract words had suggested a meaning the translation 
' into imagery could not have been made. The imagery 
1 Beauchamp’s Career, ch. 28,
-P-A-G-E-371
352 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
did not make the meaning, but was born from it and 
vivified it, So long as it only does this, well and good. 
But vivid imagery may so concentrate the meaning in 
itself that that meaning is distorted. For all images are 
particular, while the meaning is often general. If the 
whole discourse is meant to give knowledge of a pa- 
ticular thing, then any important distortion due to 
imagery arises from faulty or inadequate description. 
But if the whole thought to be conveyed is a general 
one then if it be limited by the force of the image the 
distortion may be extremely serious. Here we see the 
danger attending the use of concrete illustrations to 
make clear general truths—the danger that the similitude 
may be mentally extended beyond its proper range, which 
is usually a narrow and special one. 
Still more insidious is the danger of allowing trains 
of imagery to be substitutes for thought. To look is 
much easier than to think. But we may look at many 
things without deriving the slightest benefit, as witness 
the mode in which a large number of people pass through 
a picture gallery or a museum. Only when we lock 
for a purpose, and when what we see prompts thought 
and effort to find meaning, do we profit intellectually. 
The mere amusement of looking is quite other than the 
true interest of thinking. This distinction is often over: 
looked in lessons based on observation ; it is equally 
often neglected in lessons of narrative and description. 
Children absorbed in a series of mental pictures may 
enjoy such a lesson without putting forth any energy of 
thought. There is emotional interest, but little or n0 
intellectual interest. Such teaching is no more a trait- 
ing of the mind than basking in the sun is a training of 
the body. Each is recreation, not work. In order that
-P-A-G-E-372
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 353 
teaching which communicates knowledge should be 
educative it must evoke thinking and not simply 
encourage gazing at a mental panorama. How far it 
does so is tested by the amount of intellectual appre- 
hension and anticipation shown by the pupils. The 
teacher should have his finger on the pulse of meaning, 
and not be satisfied with the rapt attitude which may 
indicate mere sensuous enjoyment. 
It may be noted that description leads only to visual 
imagery. ‘‘I should not acquire any real knowledge of 
the Scotch air ‘‘There’s nae luck? by being told it was 
like ‘Auld lang syne,? or ‘Robin Gray; and if I said 
that Mozart’s melodies were as a summer’s sky or as the 
breath of Zephyr, I should be better understood by those 
who knew Mozart than by those who did not.”? 
Nor can speech directly communicate emotion. It can 
only raise in the hearer’s mind ideas favourable to the 
appearance of the emotion, but the latter can only be 
directly communicated from one mind to another by con- 
tagion. If a teacher desire his pupils to feel that a deed 
he is describing is hateful and despicable, it is useless for 
him to present that view merely as an intellectual judge- 
ment which awakens no corresponding feelings in his 
own breast. As well might he hope to inspire admiration 
of a work of art by casually remarking that it is beautiful, 
and then immediately turning away. 
The use of pictures to illustrate descriptive and narra- 
tive teaching is evidently of most value to the pupils 
who visualize badly. But when historical accuracy in 
the way in which places and things are thought is 
important they may be regarded as necessary to all. 
When, on the other hand, the scene is imaginary they 
1J, H. Newman: The Grammar of Assent, p. 26. 
z
-P-A-G-E-373
354 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
should be used so as not to limit the pupils’ freedom of 
interpretation. This is probably best secured by exhibit 
ing them after the description has been given. Even 
then, though they help the unimaginative they tot 
infrequently decrease the interest of the imaginative, 
Great tact and insight into the particular pupils concerned 
are needed to use illustrative pictures with a really educa- 
tive effect. 
The whole of the preceding discussion of the com- 
munication of knowledge by speech applies to its 
communication through books, which are only speech 
made visible. Words read act just as do words heard. 
Indeed, with many people they are faintly heard in 
imagination ; and with all, probably, reading is attended 
by some incipient utterance. The meaning is appre 
hended with growing clearness. Each new chapter is 
taken up into the growing whole of meaning, and $0 
the understanding becomes fuller and richer as we go 01. 
Often, indeed, our grasp of the whole meaning is made 
evident to us by our correct anticipation of parts we 
have not yet read. One can frequently see what the 
end of a novel will be long before reaching the last page 
This intelligent anticipation is due not only to the pat 
already read, but also to experience of the ordinary 
course of events in novels. The more novels one reals 
the less novelty one finds in them. This varied expett 
ence gives us not a definite knowledge of the exact court 
of the particular novel in hand, but an expectation which, 
though undetermined, is fairly definite in general form 
When we wish to read and to master more difficult 
matter we shall do well to take a hint from this experient 
of novel reading. If we read through the treatmett 
of the whole subject first, with attention indeed, but
-P-A-G-E-374
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 355 
without stopping to master the details, we provide our- 
selves with a general idea of the whole meaning which 
will help us to assimilate the matter ona second and 
more detailed study, in a similar way to that in which 
the novel reader is aided by his past readings of 
novels. The second reading should master the details, 
and their relation to each other and to the whole. To 
master them severally and fail to grasp the part each 
plays in the whole is a most worthless form of cram. 
Unhappily, it is too much cultivated by the scholastic 
habit of questioning much on separate details and little 
or not at all on relations and wholes. Yet only as a 
whole can the matter be thought, and if it be not thought 
the labour has produced nothing but a memory of empty 
phrases, which will soon be partly forgotten and partly 
confused. A third reading is most valuable if during 
it the attention be engaged with these relations; most 
valueless if it only attempt to fix more firmly the memory 
of disconnected details. The wrong way of reading is 
as common now as it was two centuries ago when Locke 
wrote: “‘ The mistake here is, that it is usually supposed 
that, by reading, the author’s knowledge is transfused 
into the reader’s understanding ; and so it is, but not 
by bare reading, but by reading and understanding what 
he writ? Or, as he says in another place, “ Reading 
furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge ; it 
is thinking makes what we read ours.”? 
In reading we have to struggle, and to teach our pupils 
to struggle, against ineffective work. Every mind has 
a good deal of mental sloth, and we all know how easy 
it is to run over page after page without bothering our- 
selves much about what it all means. Much reading of 
1 Conduct of the Human Understanding, sect. 24. 4 Ibid., sect. 20.
-P-A-G-E-375
356 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
light literature cultivates this habit of mental surface- 
scratching. Its best result is a certain amount of super- 
ficial inaccurate information ; its worst a state of mental 
stupor. Just as an oral lesson which to the pupils is 
only a succession of visual pictures is of no educative 
worth, so such reading, in which there is perception of 
the words attended only by faint adumbrations of mean- 
ing, and it may be by some visual imagery, is little but 
a waste of time. As students we can cure ourselves by 
watchfulness and self-examination on what we have read, 
As teachers we can at any rate help to cure our pupils 
by applying similar remedies to them. 
The earnest student, however, has to struggle rather 
against a wrong direction of energy than against a failure 
to put it forth. He feels that there is much to do and 
that the time is short. So he believes he has not time 
to stop to think : he must simply try to remember. One 
of the most valid and most serious charges against the 
custom of regarding preparation for examinations as the 
chief work of school and university is just this sense 
of want of time, and the consequent intellectually breath- 
less study. Certainly it is true that in the long run 
the method of learning by thinking is the more rapid. 
But it is apparently slower at first, and the earnest 
student is afraid to trust to the long run lest it should 
be too long for him. He has to keep up with his class 
now at the beginning, and the teacher of the class has 
too often not arranged the work so that progress, though 
beginning slow, is gradually but surely accelerated. 
‘Whatever the reason, the prevalence of such a mode 
of learning in any place and at any time is absolutely 
incompatible with true intellectual education. For such 
knowledge only makes the pedant, who can, perhaps
-P-A-G-E-376
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 357 
talk about many things, but whose mind has not been 
trained to deal with the real concerns of life, whose 
so-called knowledge is mere lumber which has not 
increased his efficiency because it has not been taken up 
into original capacity and, by feeding it, developed 
aptitude. “The judgement is little better, and the 
stock of knowledge not increased, by being able to repeat 
what others have said or produce the arguments we 
have found in them.” ! oo 
Whether, then, knowledge be presented by reading 
or by hearing, it is assimilated only when it is actively 
thought, and not passively received by the senses and 
the understanding. Such active thought: shows itself 
in intelligent anticipation. Doubtless, the relative parts 
played by thinking under direction of what is said and 
by intelligent inference as to what will be said will vary 
indifferent subjects as well as in different minds. When 
the record is of facts, as in history or in the description 
of a people, the latter will be relatively small. Still the 
former is also an active process, just as is a physical 
ativity guided by imitation. Thought is directed in 
its activity, but it must be active nevertheless, or there 
is no enteting into the spirit of the new matter, no 
making it part of one’s own life experience. That this 
activity may never cease, the teacher, especially of young 
children, will do well to encourage every possible out- 
ward expression of it. When children are simply asked 
to listen there is always the danger that visual imagery 
may supplant thought instead of being auxiliary to it. 
When, however, the communicated knowledge is less 
of fact than of relations, the activity required is the 
grasping of a demonstration. Here the aim should be 
TLocke : Ibid. sect. 20.
-P-A-G-E-377
358 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
to make originative suggestion play as large a part as 
possible. Direct guidance of thought should be 
subordinate to intelligent anticipation, whereas in the 
former case the opposite relation holds good. 
In speaking of reading I have, of course, meant the 
gaining of the thought of another through the printed 
or written page. In this process the whole function of 
the printed words is to suggest meaning. That is to 
say, the explicit direction of attention is conceptual, 
while the perceptive process of recognizing the printed 
symbols is implicit. We are at once aware of this if 
an unknown word suddenly wrenches attention from 
meaning to visible form. The fact that the meaning 
raised in our minds may be of a concrete thing or event, 
and that we try to think it in a way which approaches 
perception as nearly as possible, is not at all inconsistent 
with the statement that attention to meaning is com 
ceptual. For the percepts in reading are of letters and 
words, and when the meaning suggested is concrete it 
is because the reading calls up the thought of a concreté 
fact or event, not because it makes us think of the letters 
or words. 
Reading to oneself for meaning has all the character 
istics of a process in which the percepts are only cuts 
to meaning. The practised reader when he is running 
over matter very easy to him by no means says all th 
words to himself, or, indeed, sees all the words 
separate things. He reads in phrases or in sentences 
or even in longer divisions. A few salient words stand 
out, as we saw salient letters do in the recognition of 8 
familiar word, and they are sufficient as indications of 
the general meaning of the passage. If the meaning 
be at all obscure more detailed examination is necessary’
-P-A-G-E-378
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 359 
each word may be read, the relation of clause to clause 
may be definitely attended to, reference may even be 
made to an earlier passage, until the whole meaning 
stands clear. But the perception is still purely instru- 
mental, and its extent is still determined by the facility 
and completeness of the appreciation of the meaning. 
Very different from this process is that of reading 
aloud. Here there are two perceptual processes, The 
one is that of recognition of printed symbols: the other 
is the utterance of sounds corresponding to those sym- 
bols. It is this latter process that sets the purpose, and 
toit effort must be given. True, apprehension of mean- 
ing must be present if the reading is to be really intelli- 
gent, for, as has been already pointed out, not the words 
only but the way they are uttered compose expressive 
speech. Yet a general grasp of meaning is often 
sufficient to enable a practised oral reader to phrase, to 
modulate his voice, and to mark relative emphasis in a 
broadly intelligent way ; though he will only read ex- 
quisitely if the full force of the passage determine his 
utterance. But this possibility shows that reading aloud 
is no real test of the power of getting intellectual nutri- 
ment from books. I once asked a university student 
who had just read aloud a passage with considerable 
expression his opinion of its truth. His reply was 
instructive: ‘‘ Let me glance through it first to see what 
it is about.” 
Reading aloud is a form of practical skill, and its per- 
fection depends even more on the organs of speech than 
on the intelligence. A good elocutionist is not of neces- 
sity a very intelligent reader, and, on the other hand, a 
reader who profits much by what he reads may be unable 
to read it aloud so as to give pleasure to his hearers.
-P-A-G-E-379
360 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
Indeed, when we realize the different ends in view in 
the two cases we shall see that much practice in reading 
aloud, especially when not preceded by reading for 
meaning, is likely to form a habit which will interfere 
with that full and explicit attention to meaning whic 
is of the very essence of true reading. 
It is really unfortunate that because these two forms 
of activity are classed together under one name they are 
commonly regarded as identical. It is easy for a teacher 
to judge how well his pupils read aloud ; not nearly 9 
easy to test their skill in understanding what they read. 
Too often he confuses the one exercise with the other, 
and regards good elocution as evidence of power of 
reading, though in the latter meaning is the centre of 
interest, in the former it is ancillary to utterance. An 
analysis of the processes involved indicates that there 
is no such necessary connexion as is commonly assumed, 
and experience supplies examples of the evil effects of 
the confusion. Sir W. H. Broadbent has recorded the 
following case— 
“T was informed that a boy of fourteen, of superior 
intelligence, was kept in a lower class at school because 
he could not read aloud, and that his prospects in life 
were likely to be injured by his not reaching the proper 
standard. 
“I found him to be remarkably alert intellectually, 
fond of reading, particularly adventures and travels, full 
of information, ready and apt in conversation, and 
altogether a very interesting boy. He could not explain 
his difficulty in reading aloud. I gave him two long 
and rather complicated paragraphs from the Times to 
read, and asked him to tell me what they were about. 
This he did readily and clearly. I then asked him to
-P-A-G-E-380
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 36: 
read them aloud. His face at once took on an expression 
of anxious effort. He did not read even short words 
fluently, but uttered two or three with the slight hesi- 
tancy.and uncertainty of a beginner, and was then 
brought to a standstill for a moment by some longer 
word, not because it was difficult or unfamiliar, but 
apparently as if he had to grasp its meaning and pass it 
through his mind for utterance. Sometimes it seemed as 
ifhe were on the point of substituting another word. ... 
“There was clearly no word-blindness in the true 
sense of the term, since that is a purely sensory defect, 
and this was a motor failure, nota sensory defect. Words 
printed or written reached his mind with normal readi- 
ness, and were perfectly understood. There was no 
fault in the mechanism of speech or intellectual expres- 
sion.... The afferent and efferent paths, and the 
sensory and motor centres concerned in language as an 
intellectual process, were intact. It was utterance in one 
particular respect which was interfered with—the trans- 
lation of visual characters into the articulate sounds 
which they represented. 
“This boy ultimately gained the faculty of reading 
aloud fairly well, but with great effort, and when he read 
aloud the attention was so concentrated on the task that 
he did not understand what he read.”} 
The practical conclusion is obvious. Reading aloud

nered in books. It, too, has to be learnt, for it also is 
skill. It must therefore be practised, for only by practice 
is any form of skill, be it physical or be it intellectual, 
attained. 
The rule that communicated knowledge should make 
for efficiency, and that this is possible only so far as the 
information can be taken up into personal experienc 
by thought, makes it clear that it is useless to require 
the learning of facts which are simply facts. Only » 
far as facts can be related to each other can they be 
thought ; only so far as that relation can be extended 
to ourselves can they be used. Whatever increases 
understanding of the world around has value, whether 
it throw light on material things or on human societies 
Whatever is mere fact may have an incidental use a 
detail to add vividness to a general meaning, but is not 
worthy of retention. I remember being told, when a 
small boy, by one of my teachers that Everest was 29,002 
feet high. I asked whether that included the snow, 
and was told that it did. I then enquired whether 
melting at one time and a prolonged fall at another would 
not cause this height to vary. My teacher’s reply ws 
more forcible than satisfactory to my thirst for undet- 
standing ; for the question had been asked in all good 
faith. Whether it was the emphasis of the answer of 
the absurdity of the statement I know not, but I hat 
never forgotten it. Nor has it been useless to me, # 
it has supplied me with a good illustration both of what 
not to teach and of how not to teach. 
This anecdote illustrates the complaint humorous] 
put by Mr Arnold Golsworthy : “‘ The great fault about 
geography is that the details don’t seem to lead any 
where when you've got them. I could not, for instant
-P-A-G-E-382

say at this moment, without reference to the encyclo- 
paedia, how many feet Snowdon rises above the sea, 
but I can still follow the ordinary run of commer- 
cial and political life, and my digestion and general 
health seem in no way affected by the want of these 
figures. ... 
On the other hand, I know that the river Thames rises 
in the neighbourhood of the Cotswold hills, but I am 
not disguising the truth when I unhesitatingly assert 
that the possession of this knowledge, acquired at great 
pains in my boyhood, has never been of the slightest 
usetome. I cannot look to it to heighten my happiness 
in hours of sunshine, nor can I turn to it for sympathy 
and consolation in times of depression and liver trouble. 
It is nothing more than a bald, empty fact, that I could 
have acquired at any moment by referring to my table 
atlas, and I have given it house room for years in my 
mental fit-up, and have looked in vain to see anything 
grow on it or out of it. It has always seemed a little 
strange to me that the average school-boy should be 
inflated with jetsam of this kind, and yet never have so 
much as hinted to him a few of the peculiarities of the 
law of his country, or the scope of his future duties as 
4 man and a citizen.” * 
Geography should induce in the pupils an interest in 
the common natural phenomena around them, and an 
ability to apply such knowledge to the understanding 
of natural phenomena similar, and yet different, else- 
where. Above all, it should extend the range of their 
human sympathies, and this it can only do on condition 
that it represents vividly the life of other lands. Names 
should always mean much more than marks on a map:

364 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
those to which it is not necessary to give any further 
meaning should be rigorously excluded. 
Similarly, history should aim at increasing the under- 
standing of life, and to do this it must lay bare the way 
people lived, felt, and thought in earlier days. To teach 
the young that happy and useful lives were lived under 
conditions very different from those of to-day is todo | 
them no small service. That this may be real to them 
it must be so presented that the conditions of life are 
within their comprehension, Thus, the presentation 
will necessarily be different at one age from what it is 
at another. The essential thing is that it be alive. A 
host of dates accompanied by bald statements of ‘import- 
ant events’ is mere worthless lumber which buries 
thought under a dust-heap. Whether in history or in 
geography the pupils must live in imagination in con- 
ditions different from their own, and must think out how 
those conditions would affect life. 
The teaching of history raises of necessity the question 
of the apprehension of time. Personal experience gives 
us at the best but a small grasp of time-relations. We 
all know how untrustworthy our personal estimation of 
time often proves when tested by the clock. Memory of 
our past is not much more definite. We may remember 
the sequence of important events pretty accurately, yet 
there seems no subjective distinction between how an 
event of thirty years ago appears in memory and how 
one of twenty-five years ago does so. We fix our past 
largely by associating events with the dates of the years, 
sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. ‘‘ I remember 
that in 1887 I did such a thing, because I did it in the 
same year as I did something else, and that was in the 
year of Queen Victoria’s first jubilee” is the kind of 
y
-P-A-G-E-384
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 365 
combination we often find helpful. If we went by 
vividness, indeed, many an event of childhood would 
seem more recent than the doings of a year ago. 
We may say, then, that our time arrangement of our 
own past is essentially conceptual. Our grasp of the 
time-series of history is only an extension of this. We 
cannot get a vivid and perceptual grasp of those rela- 
tions: in that sense we certainly cannot realize them. 
But we can think them conceptually as separated by 
greater or less intervals and as less or more remote from 
our own days. True, our generalizing habit leads us 
toclass under single ideas long periods which we happen 
to have marked by a single name. But such classing 
was induced by some real similarity, and so long as we 
bear in mind that this similarity yet showed itself in 
successive diversities no harm is done. . 
Evidently, then, a history without dates would be a 
history not articulated into a whole. Dates must be 
learned, but every date should be full of meaning ; that 
is, should be the cue to thought and imagination to 
traverse a well-known country. 
Conceptual thought on any kind of matter means 
examining the forms and relations of the objects of per- 
ception. In language, grammar has this function. The 
learning of it should, therefore, follow the general lines 
of conceptual investigation. Now, conceptual thought 
is only prompted in matter which is already familiar in 
Perception, not only as objects which can be recognized 
but still more as means which can be used ; for the per- 
ceptual interest is alwayS practical. It is in opposition, 
then, to natural mental development to teach grammar 
to children who have not attained a good working 
mastery over language. In the next place, it is to be
-P-A-G-E-385
366 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
noted that the relations of words are abstract, and will 
appear devoid both of interest and of real meaning if 
the apprehension of them is not seen to be of value in 
interpreting the language of others or in the personal 
use of language. ‘‘ Why is this passage obscure although 
its words are all familiar?” That, with a carefully chosen 
passage, will give a prompting to a study which will 
clear up such obscurities and explain their origin. Only 
if in some such way the desire to examine the relations 
of words—which express relations of thought—is 
aroused, will children take up the study in the spirit 
which alone can make it educationally profitable. This 
would point to having very few set grammar lessons but 
to investigating problems of speech-construction when- 
ever they occur. Nor should the grammatical investigs- 
tions be pushed beyond the point at which they elucidate 
thought and the expression of thought in language. 
It is the failure to keep to such lines as these which 
has made grammar so much disliked in schools. There 
hangs round it a tradition of being both worthless and 
repulsive, which is passed on from generation to gener 
tion of pupils, and which induces a prejudice at the very 
first which is seldom overcome, and which, indeed, the 
teaching too often is by no means calculated to overcome. 
If a teacher would succeed he must adopt the line of 
stimulating a felt need, and he will perhaps be wise to 
drop the name ‘grammar? altogether though he retain 
the thing. 
When a foreign language is learnt it should certaialy 
be learnt as a language, that is, as a means of vod 
communication of thought. When this is not done 
there is, psychologically speaking, no learning of 4 
language at all. Much of the traditional teaching of
-P-A-G-E-386
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 367 
Latin taught what had been a language in such a way 
that it never became a language to the learners. Take 
a boy trying to puzzle out the meaning of a Latin page 
before him, on which the majority of the words are 
unknown. What goes on in his mind? He perceives 
each word asa word. It would probably be impossible 
to find in human life a nearer approach to pure percep- 
tion, for these words which he can pronounce with more 
or less accuracy raise in his mind no ideas. One by one 
he seeks equivalent words in a Latin-English dictionary. 
Often he writes them down without any apparent idea 
that their combination is meant to convey a meaning. 
I remember once asking a class of boys in a school I 
was examining whether they supposed that boys had ever 
ued such words in their play, their quarrels, or their 
lessons. They evidently thought me either insane to 
imagine such a thing or a grim humorist who was trying 
to see how foolish they could be. Anyway they were 
not to be caught, and greeted the suggestion with 
derision. Of course, in the same school the following 
year I received a different answer ; but that was because 
Thad converted not the boys but the teacher. Probably 
this was an extreme case ; the boys were young and had 
never heard of Roman history. But it illustrates my 
Point that it is possible to teach what is technically a 
linguage in such a way that it is not accepted as a 
language by the learners. 
If the guiding principle of teaching a language as a 
language be borne in mind the method will be one that 
will carry that language into the pupils? actual lives. It 
will, therefore, take advantage of all they know in their 
mother-tongue so far as it helps the mastery of the new 
language. If they have studied English grammar it is
-P-A-G-E-387
368 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
absurd to refuse to refer to grammatical relations; if 
they read English well so much the earlier can they with 
profit begin to read French or German or Latin. 
_ Farther, the teaching will recognize that in internal 
“speech the constant and most important element is 
incipient utterance of words, and that the memory of 
language is essentially the acquisition of a motor habit. ': 
Whether this be accompanied by a mental hearing of 
the words, a mental image of them as written, or a visual 
picture of something which exemplifies their meaning, 
is accidental, in the sense that none of these things either 
takes place in all minds or is necessary in any. Speech, 
in short, should be taught as essentially spoken, not as 
more or less artificially connected with a mental picture 
gallery. 
, Nothing is worth learning which is not in some sense 
; worthy to be a permanent possession. In considering 
this in connexion with personal experiences we saw that 
the most important mode of retention is absorption in 
a growing intellectual or physical aptitude. The expeti- 
ence does not retain an individuality for memory, but 
we are richer than we should have been without it ; able 
to act or to think more successfully. It is exactly the 
same with those communicated experiences which we are 
now considering. They enrich our lives if they att 
really made part of our lives by imagination and thought, 
warmed with that emotion without which they must 
remain really outside us. Again, just as the individual 
personal experiences which can be separately recalled 
are those which for some reason had an exceptional 
emotional value for us, so we best remember what we 
were most interested in learning. If that interest be 
very strong, one hearing or reading may be sufficient
-P-A-G-E-388
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 369 
to enable us to recall an idea or a narrative. A child 
really interested in an account of some heroic deed will 
remember that deed probably for life, certainly for years, 
Of course, items of knowledge which are thus retained 
arenot isolated. They are parts of organs.of knowledge 
in which many other less striking items have been more 
ot less completely absorbed. They are characteristic , 
features of such organs, and they have their,value for us - 
in proportion as the systems of thought and feeling of 
which they form parts are strong and active. In these 
organs they are united with personal experiences to form 
determining factors in our present and future lives. 
Too often, however, learning at school has meant the 
getting by rote of that which has in no way been taken 
up into the life. Here, as we know well, much repeti- 
tion is necessary, and even then the possession in neither 
sure nor permanent. The explanation is very simple. 
Learning by rote is little or nothing more than the for- 
mation of a mechanical habit of utterance or of visualiz- 
ing or of both combined, when the matter learnt is read 
off from the mental picture. Like all such habits much 
practice is needed to perfect it. Think how many times 
one must throw a ball before one can send it unerringly 
through a ring but little larger than itself, suspended a 
couple of yards in front of one. This practice we should 
not undertake unless for some reason we desired to attain 
the skill. In much school learning such an incentive 
is wanting. Many a boy, for instance, does not desire 
to know the intricacies of Latin grammar, and he is only 
induced to give the requisite practice in repeating 
declensions and conjugations by quite extraneous 
appeals, So, too, it is with lists of kings and queens 
and dates, with statistics of population, heights of moun-

tains, lengths of rivers, and all such scholastic rubbish. 
These things are incapable of provoking interest because 
by themselves they are devoid of meaning, and the child 
has not within him the intellectual setting which alone 
can give them life. Such learning is, then, a mechanical 
process. It forms a habit which gradually dies away as 
soon as the activity ceases to be practised. The decay 
is obvious from the first, for every error is apparent 
more clearly than it is in a similarly acquired activity 
of movement only visible to sight. In a letter to The 
Times* objecting to compulsory Greek at Oxford, Mr 
A. C. Benson incidentally gives a striking instance of 
how far such mechanical acquirement may be, and 
actually has been, carried: ‘‘The other night a parent 
was telling me what his boy did to pass the Cambridge 
Little-go. He was a boy with a gift for mechanial 
science and a strong visualizing faculty. He learnt a 
crib by heart, and he learnt the Greek interlined with the 
crib, not as language at all, but as a series of meaningless 
pictures or friezes. His careful tutor first eliminated 
from his crib all pieces set in the two previous years, and 
thus nearly upset the affair, because a piece was set of 
which the first two lines were the last two lines of a 
piece that had recently been set; so that when the boy 
looked at the piece to his horror he could not recognize 
the frieze! However, after a moment he saw the well- 
known forms a line or two further down, and at once 
rolled off his lesson.” 
From the standpoint of efficiency such learning is 
absolutely worthless. ‘‘To know by rote is not to 
know” truly said Montaigne. Nor do observation and 
experiment give any sure ground for believing that

-P-A-G-E-390
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 371 
such exercise strengthens even the power of learning by 
rote. Certainly I myself was compelled to learn many 
hundreds of dates in English history when I was a boy. 
Equally certainly my power of recalling dates is abnorm- 
ally small, and to the best of my remembrance it has 
sheen so always; assuredly ever since I reached man- 
hood. 
In rejecting such mechanical learning, however, I by 
no means declare against all learning by heart. Two 
conditions may be laid down—that what is so learnt is 
needed and that it is understood. Under the former 
head come all such things as the multiplication table, 
spelling, and, generally, the merely executive elements in 
our knowledge. Unless these are perfectly at command 
thought is continually baffled. They are, indeed, 
mechanical in their nature and should be made automatic 
in their operation. But even they should be practised 
in matter which has value and in ways which by their 
variety evoke interest in the results they are the means 
towards attaining. 
Under ‘need? I would assuredly include beautiful 
passages which, in Bacon’s words, ‘‘serve for delight.” 
They are learnt with avidity if they give delight 
tow, and a wise teacher will choose no others. Real 
poetry and beautiful prose-sayings do not lose either 
their force or their savour as we grow older. On the 
contrary we find in them ever more and more as experi- 
ence gives them ever a wider setting. To them, too, 
may be applied Emerson’s words: ‘‘ Nature and books 
belong to the eyes that see them. It depends on the 
mood of the man, whether he shall see the sunset or the 
fine poem.?? 
1Essay on Experience,

So we reach the negative rule that nothing should 
be learnt by heart without justification. This means 
more than that the teacher should not set such tasks 
unnecessarily. It implies that he should be on his guard 
lest his pupils learn by heart instead of thinking and 
understanding. For, in early life at any rate, perceptual 
activity is naturally preferred to conceptual. So boys 
and girls find it easier to learn words by rote than to grasp 
thoroughly the meaning those words should convey. 
They will often, then, rest satisfied with that vague 
apprehension of meaning which attends perceptual read- 
ing, and which is all they get even when they read to 
themselves unless they are taught and trained to think 
what they read. They will repeat phrases and state 
ments, and even believe they understand them, just 
because they have not critically examined their own 
thought, and so do not know how superficial and imper- 
fect it is. If, then, they are told to prepare a chapter 
in a book they will, if not trained to do otherwis, 
commit to memory as many of the striking phrases # 
they can. The attempt at reproduction often shows 
fantastic blunders, 
“But though they wrote it all by rote, 
They did not write it right.” 1 
Really, though in a sense it is natural to man to think, 
yet it is only through much training that he deliberately 
sets himself to think when he sees some easier way of 
getting a simulacrum of knowledge. But of cours 
without the awakening of thought there is no red 
interest, just as without interest it is impossible to pre 
voke real thought. Thought is the means by which the

intellectual purpose given by interest strives to attain its 
end. 
Very little of what is learnt from books needs to be: 
verbally retained. Consequently it is a mistake to 
encourage reproductions of the expressions of the book 
or even of the order in which topics are there treated. 
Areproduction in the pupil’s own words, and centred 
round a given thought, is the most valuable... 
Thoughts by their very nature enter into relations 
with other thoughts, for thinking is essentially a seeking 
for relations. The more completely this is accomplished 
in any mind the more fully is that mind able to bring out 
of its treasury things new and old which are pertinent 
tothe actual situation. It follows that memory improves 
with life. The common belief that it is strongest in 
childhood is based on the restriction of ‘ memory’ to 
the recall of specific items, especially of some definite 
form of words. It is in the essential sense that memory —~ 
improves—the sense which sees in it the whole process 
of the storing of experience, and the slow gathering of 
wisdom and understanding. The power of memory in 
life is shown much more in ripeness of judgement than 
in facility of remembering items either of. personal 
cuperience or of knowledge derived from others. The 
litter may be copious and yet the man be far from wise. 
His acquired information has not entered into the life- 
blood of his experience, which is his trae memory. 
Yet there are times when we do require to recall some 
patticular item, and, as we all know, we often are unable 
todo so. Left to itself our train of ideas ows on in 
hverie, unguided by any specific purpose and not limited 
toany one topic. We cannot tell beforehand what line 
| our musings will follow. ‘‘ The first line of a poem, if
-P-A-G-E-393
374 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
I have previously read the poem, may suggest to me 
the second line, by its relation of former contiguity; it 
may suggest, by resemblance of thought or language, 
some similar line of another author ; it may suggest, by 
contrast, some of those ludicrous images which constitute 
parody ; or it may suggest some image in harmony with 
its own subject, and some appropriate language with 
which to invest it, as when it suggested to its author 
the second line, and all the following lines of his poem” 
The extent to which we can determine these sugges 
tions is the extent to which we can command our 
remembrances. It is an analogous case to solving 
a new problem. The thoughts in our mind give us 
many suggestions, and we choose among them one on 
which we concentrate attention. This in turn raises 
other suggestions from among which choice is agai 
made. Now, whether we are trying to solve a problem 
or to remember something, we are able thus to selec, 
because the absence of the solution or of the remem 
brance is not a bare absence. It is an expectation, 9 
vague that we cannot see the solution, or recall whut 
we wish, and yet sufficiently definite in its general form 
to negate suggestions which do not satisfy it. Weal 
know the strange elusiveness of the thought which we 
cannot recall, but which, as we say, ‘‘is on the tip of out 
tongue.” 
All we can do, then, when we try to recollect some 
thing we wish to recall is to select among our thoughts 
that which this vague expectation best accepts, and to 
dwell on it in the hope that, directly or indirectly, it 
may mediate the recall we desire. When the recall is 
made we sometimes can, but more often cannot, specify 
1 Brown : Philosophy of the Human Mind, lect. 42, |
-P-A-G-E-394
LEARNING FROM COMMUNICATION 3975 
all the successful suggestions. Especially do we fail to 
do this when the recalled thought comes suddenly i into 
mind long after we have ceased to search for it and have 
turned our minds to something else. If we could make. 
such an analysis of the process of recall as would lay bare 
every detail of its working, we should have taken 
a great step towards putting recollection in our own 
power ; for to know exactly how suggestion has operated 
would indicate to us how to set to work to secure such 
operation in the future. Such a task is hopeless, for the 
mode of connexion is different in every special case. 
Our psychology can never cope with the rich complexity 
of our mental lives. 
However, inability to recall a separate item is seldom 
of serious import. It may, indeed, be a temporary 
inconvenience, as when one meets a person and cannot 
recollect his name. But in the essential matters of life 
itis not recall of particulars but organized and meditated 
experience which counts.

CHAPTER XI 
CRITICAL THOUGHT 
Erriciency of life means power to deal with the various 
situations of life as they arise—to see what each requires 
and how such requirements may best be met, to dis- 
tinguish what is essential in it from what may be disre- 
garded. In short, life is a continual solving of problems 
of all degrees of difficulty in all spheres of human 
activity, moral, practical, and intellectual. Nor, especi- 
ally in moral and practical matters, can time always, or 
even generally, be spared for pondering over various 
possibilities. We must often act at once, or action will 
be of no use. Yet, unless that action be guided by 
knowledge and insight into the circumstances it is more 
than possible that it will be disastrous. Soundness of 
judgement, or practical intelligence, must be an immediate 
perception of the nature of the call made upon us, carry- 
ing with it the expectation of how acts of our own will 
modify the situation. This is a work of skill, for skill 
is trained capacity to do the right thing in the right way 
at the right time, whether the doing be bodily or mental. 
In this aspect of life we find the justification of the old 
Greek view that living is a fine art. 
When we examine skill in living more closely we see 
that it is at once knowledge and active intelligence. 
Intelligence faces the present with the guidance derived

from the stored experience of the past. The more:nearly 
that experience corresponds to the present position the 
more immediately can the nature of the action required: 
be discerned. So a boy finds no difficulty in solving'a 
mathematical problem of the same general kind ag many 
others which he has already solved. So, too, we-act 
almost automatically in the customary affairs of life. It 
is when there is something new and strange. in’ the 
occasion which calls for. our action that: we: havé-to 
deliberate and weigh possible alternative courses against 
each other. 
Even here it is plain that the suggestion of courses 
is altogether determined by our experience of possi- 
bilities. We seek some analogy in the past to guide us 
in the present. Not that we stickle for a precedent in 
the same strict sense as is demanded in constitutional and 
kgal matters, for our decision will not form.a general 
tule for the future guidance of others. Yet it is only 
inour past experience that we can find anything to throw 
light on our present needs. 
The pondering on what we are to do causes suggestion 
ter suggestion to come hefore-us. It is not-a mere 
matter of memory, for then we recognize at once which 
suggestions fit the case. Here we have to look forward 
into circumstances which are not yet real, to see in 
imagination the result of an action, to harmonize it 
with principles which we accept as true. Ina word, we 
have to weigh and compare various suggestions, reject- 
ing at last all but one. This we may do on several 
grounds. We may be swayed by the emotions and 
Passions of the moment, by our own present wishes, or 
hy the persuasions of others. Or we may try to estimate 
«itically the alternative courses and to come to a decision
-P-A-G-E-397
378 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
on more permanent grounds than those of present feeling 
and impulse. This is, of course, the only safe course 
to take in cases which are really difficult. I do not mean 
at all that in such deliberation intellectual considerations 
should be regarded as the only determinants of rational 
conduct. Due weight should be given to such factors 
as sense of duty, social solidarity, emotional bonds ° 
Man is not mere intellect, and all attempts to regulate 
his life by purely intellectual principles are doomed to 
ultimate failure, and during the time they are accepted 
yield an abundant crop of human trouble and sorrow. 
The abstract economic theory which dominated much of 
English economic and political life in the first half of the 
nineteenth century furnishes a case in point. Looking 
only at the economic side of life it assumed individual 
material self-interest as the one motive-power of men. 
So long as one keeps to its abstractions its conclusions 
follow as certainly as do those of mathematics. But 
they have even less relation to actual life, in which the 
motives to action are very various and in which men do 
hot exist as independent competitive units. 
Sound judgement in human affairs, then, means aa 
lligence which, as far as it can see them, fries 
count of all the factors, and to allow each i its 
due weight. Such mental alertness is a habit, and grows 
in efficiency by practice. Like other habits also, it decays 
if not in constant activity, and in its place we have a 
slavish following of precedent, or acting blindly accord- 
ing to rule without regard to changes in the conditions 
under which the act is to be done. The efficient mind 
is avid of new experiences which will bring new know- 
ledge. To learn is as essential to it as to breathe, to 
act on its learning as necessary as bodily movement.

This mental activity is shown in various forms. ‘We

Further, however strong may be one’s special bent, 
the satisfaction of it cannot fill the whole of life. If, 
indeed, it fill too large a proportion of our thoughts, 
and govern too exclusively our actions, we become 
narrow specialists, whose special work itself will suffer 
from its isolation from the rest of the field of experience. 
In the conduct of life we need wide and varied knowledge 
both of men and of things, or many are the practical 
mistakes we shall make. 
It follows that as education seeks to prepare for life 
it should secure a wide range of knowledge, both for 
its direct bearing on life’s problems and because only so 
can occasion be given for calling out the special interests 
of a number of pupils taught together. But it follows 
with equal truth that this knowledge must really enter 
into experience so as to form organs adapted to meet 
and deal with a variety of calls. We may try to give .

knowledge and intellectual skill apart from each other, 
and to some extent we may succeed. But neither is real 
and fruitful. Knowledge which does not light our path 
gives us no help in difficulty ; it is at best a source of 
delight in times of ease: skill which has no material of 
knowledge to work upon is only a kind of conjuror’s 
adroitness applied to ideas specially made for its purposes, 
Mind does not grow by its own activity, nor by what 
it absorbs, but by its own working ; and working implies 
both activity and material. Its growth is gradual and 
continuous, nor can we lay the whole process bare. We 
judge the stage it has reached by the kind of problems 
it attacks and by the kind of solutions it suggests. 
A young child often asks ‘‘ Why?” but it is satisfied 
with any kind of answer, for its brief and meagre 
experience does not enable it to test the answer critically 
by other and pertinent knowledge. So, too, its very 
lack of knowledge allows its interest to be satisfied 
almost as soon as it is awakened, and it turns its enquiries 
towards the next thing that arrests it. Indeed, in early 
years there is no true seeking for knowledge, but only 
a preliminary glance at what there is to know. 
So, too, there is no power to determine conduct except 
in customary circumstances, where adherence to simple 
rule or the following of impulse enables the child to act 
without seeking special guidance. Often he finds he has 
made a mistake, and that what he has done is condemned. 
By such experiences. he gradually builds up a greater 
skill in acting so as to win the approval of those he loves. 
This means that he is becoming more critical of his 
impulses, and is learning to try them at the bar of con- 
science by the regulations laid down by authority. A 
further advance is marked by a growing power of
-P-A-G-E-400
CRITICAL THOUGHT | 38x 
adapting the interpretation and application of the. rules 
to more varied cases, and consequently an increasing 
insight into both the motives and the consequences of 
various modes of behaviour. A much later stage is the 
explicit study of the rules and maxims he has hitherto 
received, so as to determine their real meaning and scope. 
This can hardly be effectively entered upon much prior 
to adolescence. The ultimate stage of criticism of the 
tules themselves—trying them by some more ultimate 
standard and affirming, modifying, or rejecting, them— 
requires for its profitable undertaking a fullness of 
experience, a ripeness of judgement, and a control of 
passion, which are not to be attained before manhood. 
Growth in judgement, then, is marked by increasing 
depth of comprehension. ‘This can result only from 
increasing power to keep the same topic before the mind ; 
so that, perhaps, the most obvious sign of mental growth 
is extension of the period during which the attention is 
concentrated in one line of interest, and the frequency 
with which it returns to it after any distraction. For 
strength of interest is not to be gauged merely by the 
concentration of attention at the moment, but yet more 
by its recurrent power. 
Increase in the duration of attention implies that the 
object attended to becomes more and more full of 
challenge to the mind. For when there is no question 
to answer there is nothing to which to attend. Thus 
there is increasing richness in suggestion from past 
experience ; more analogies occur to the mind, more 
meaning is in the thought. It is this, indeed, which 
leads to the fuller comprehension, for every such sugges- 
tion is an expectation prompting to its own realization. 
But some of them prove unacceptable, impossible, or
-P-A-G-E-401
382 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
inconsistent with what is already known. So grows that 
power of discrimination and choice of suggestions as 
deserving further trial in which the child is so deficient 
and which in the skilled worker in any department has 
become almost automatic. An expert student of science 
seeking an explanation of an observed phenomenon 
rejects many suggestions before they have really taken 
form in his thought. Their unsuitability is felt, and so 
need not be thought. But the immediacy of the rejec- 
tion is the effect of skill, perfected by long practice, and 
involving both abundant pertinent knowledge which is 
taken for granted and the trained intelligence which 
can act on this knowledge without making it explicit, 
or, indeed, in many cases, implicit. 
This power of critical discrimination can only act in 
the material in which it has grown ; for its very essence 
is the immediate feeling of incompatibility or compati- 
bility with knowledge which is taken for granted or is, at 
most, implicit. If that knowledge be small, the judge- 
ment has no guarantee of soundness. No matter how 
perfectly one has been trained in mathematics, in the 
grammar of the classical languages, or in some branch 
of physical science, yet that training can not fit one to 
decide justly in matters in which one is devoid of this 
organ of knowledge. It is because this concrete nature 
of mental criticism has not been recognized that it has 
been believed that the judgement is a faculty independent 
of knowledge. 
In so far as education is the training of sound judge- 
ment it obviously continues throughout life. After our 
days of formal education by others we must take up the 
task ourselves. For it is very evident that compara- 
tively little progress can have been made by the time
-P-A-G-E-402
i RR CRITICAL THOUGHT 383 
the days of formal education are over, even when they 
are extended to the university stage ; while for the vast 
numbers of children, whose real training by others ceases 
at thirteen or fourteen, only the first steps can have been 
taken. So we must not say that it is the duty of the 
school to form a sound judgement, but only to begin that 
formation in such a way that it may be continued on 
right lines. Children of school age have but little know- 
ledge and but little intellectual skill. The question 
whether that knowledge and skill are to atrophy after 
school days are over or are to continue to grow in a sane 
and healthy way is of the utmost importance. Growth 
there will certainly be, but it may be distorted, and in 
ihsequence lead to a useless or, possibly, a mischievous 
life. 
Evidently the direction growth will take is a matter 
of interest and habitude. A teaching which ensures that 
the learning shall be the real work of the mind which 
learns, that the learner shall test his own advances, and 
that he shall be accustomed to detecting and rejecting 
the errors to which the human intelligence is most prone, 
will gradually develop a cautious and critical attitude, 
and cultivate an interest in really seeing the bearings of 
things, 
Without the guidance of teaching, such learning could 
make, at the best, but a very small advance. It is only 
when a challenge from without is felt that mind turns 
its activity in that special direction. Such a challenge 
appears as something novel and strange. But mind has 
an almost unlimited power of becoming accustomed to 
its own surroundings. These are full of matters not 
understood, though every one of them is a possible 
problem. They do not become actual problems till in

384 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
some way they interfere with our activity. Intelligence 
first develops within the scope of instinct when an 
instinctive movement is in some way hindered, or an 
instinctive impulse disappointed. And afterwards in- 
telligence works only when automatism fails. If we 
were left throughout life to such accidental spurs to 
curiosity our enquiries would go but a little way. 
Indeed, the very superficial character of our understand- 
ing of most of our material surroundings is sufficient 
proof of this. The most familiar is often the most 
imperfectly known. How many of us, for example, can 
say off-hand how many steps there are in the flight of 
stairs up and down which we pass many times a day? 
Most of the challenges to enquiry come to us from 
others, and come in many ways. Imitation, from our 
present point of view, is an enquiry into the reason and 
the value of an act we have seen done by another. The 
ordering of our lives while we are young is full of such 
implicit challenges to us to understand why we are $0 
tuled. These, however, are desultory and unsystemattt, 
and the mental alertness which they awaken is easily 
satisfied. The very essence of definite teaching is con- 
tinually to challenge the mind of the learner by showing _ 
him problems which it is worth his while, and within 
his power, to solve. In this way instruction fulfils its 
educative task of accelerating and improving tht 
development and growth of intelligence, which without 
it would be arrested at a much earlier stage than that 
which it may reach with this external stimulus. 
Instruction, then, fulfils its true task only when its 
pupils grow in real intelligence; that is, both in the desi 
arid in the power to solve increasingly difficult problems 
of conduct and of knowledge. That this has not always

been the outcome of school instruction is but too certain. 
Instruction which does not develop intelligence must, 
in one way or another, hinder its growth, simply 
because the school occupies so much of a child’s time 
and determines so largely the mental habits he forms. 
An instruction which takes no account of its pupils’ felt 
needs, which compels instead of inciting, develops 
stupidity instead of intelligence. For stupidity is the 
opposite of intelligence. It is the lack of both the wish 
and the ability to solve problems whether of life or of 
thought. The stupid person fails very often even to 
see that there is a problem, for his mind is not alert and 
% it does not notice how this situation differs from 
previous ones. In practical matters he acts on rule or 
on impulse. In intellectual matters he cannot be con- 
vinced, because he cannot see the force of arguments 
which make against his own wishes or preconceptions. 
Or he is frivolous and flippant, and can interest himself 
nothing which demands real thought. In any case 
there is an absence of critical power, and this absence 1s 
txactly proportioned to the degree of stupidity. 
No doubt stupidity may be innate, and, in some 
degree, it frequently is. But when we meet a stupid 
person it is impossible to say how the responsibility for 
his dullness should be shared between nature and nurture. 
“There is abundant evidence that a child of normal 
“pacity may be trained to a degree of stupidity resemb- 
ling innate feeble-mindedness, or to a degree of wrong- 
headedness resembling insanity, or, on the other hand, 
toa degree of intelligence which, relatively speaking, 
tesembles genius.” 1 
The normal child is the material with which the 
lArchdall Reid: The Laws of Heredity, p. 477

educator has most commonly to deal. Of course, there 
are an indefinitely large number of gradations within 
the range of normal capacity, and it is impossible to lay 
down the precise boundaries which, on the one hand, 
mark off the genius, and, on the other, the fool. A 
school failure, then, is a far more important matter than 
a paucity of remembered facts. It is an unfitting for 
life. Nor is there then any remedy. A school must 
cultivate either intelligence or stupidity : in so far as it 
fails to do the one it assuredly does the other. 
Though teaching accelerates development it does not 
change its course. This is where the unintentioml 
cultivation of stupidity so often comes in. Lessons fail 
to evoke desire, either because they present matter out 
side the range of natural—that is, possible—interest, or 
because they either confuse learning by rote with think 
ing, or actually regard the former as the right mode of 
acquisition. This is only to say that teaching is mis 
chievous when it is not the application of psychological 
knowledge. The application may be implicit, or the 
teacher may be so familiar with the working of his pupil’ 
minds that the psychology can be taken for granted. 
That, indeed, is when it is most effective. Skill 
in teaching does not differ from other forms of skill in 
its practically automatic use of the knowledge most 
essential to it. 
There is no need to repeat the analysis of the mode 
in which knowledge which is also intelligence grows 
Suffice it to recall its essential features. It is throughout 
an individual work. A teacher can make his pupil sy

looked for in Ais deeds, mental or physical. So, too, 
it is throughout a process in which everything that can 
be made the explicit object of attention must first be 
implicit in some whole which is explicitly attended to. 
Thus, all advance in understanding is/an advance towards 
systematic knowledge. Relations between objects of 
perception are at first implicit, and are next explicitly 
thought as holding in the case or cases studied, then 
generalized and thought as holding between all such 
objects. For instance, a child strikes a match to get a 
light long before he explicitly thinks of the striking as 
an efficient cause of the lighting. That may become 
explicit to him if he want to strike a match but can find 
no suitable rough surface handy. If left to himself he will 
probably generalize that all matches will light by striking 
ona rough surface, but only implicitly and practically ; 
that is, he will so proceed whenever he wishes to light a 
match. But if a definite question be put to him as to 
how to light a match he will at once explicitly state his 
generalization. So far there has been no critical thought. 
If now he try to strike a safety match on a rough 
surface which has not been suitably prepared he fails to 
achieve the desired result. What happens? If left to 
himself, and if he cannot light it after several trials, he 
Probably assumes that the match has something wrong 
With it, and throws it away. If, however, someone ask 
him why the match did not light, then a problem is 
placed before him which to some extent he can solve. 
It may be assumed that he cannot make a chemical 
analysis either of the match or of various surfaces, and 
that, moreover, he has not the preparatory chemical 
knowledge of the constituents required to secure lighting 
without which such analysis would be meaningless and
-P-A-G-E-407
388 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
unguided. But he can suggest certain reasons on the 
level of his kngwledge and intelligence, such as—the 
match might be wet, or there must be something peculiar 
in a surface on which striking it produces a light. He 
can also test these suppositions ; the former one fully, 
the latter one sufficiently to attain practical certainty. 
For he can ensure that the match is dry, and finding that 
still it will not light on ordinary rough surfaces he rejects 
the first suggested explanation of his previous failure, 
Then, by trying many rough surfaces, including that 
provided by the match-box, he is satisfied by the evidence 
that there és some peculiarity in that surface. Comparison 
with the striking of an ordinary match will lead him to 
the further conclusion that there is also a peculiarity in 
the safety match itself, and that the two peculiarities 
work together and are related to each other. Another 
problem may thus be presented by the difference between 
the striking of a safety match and that ot an ordinary 
match, and he may infer, reasonably enough, that in 
some way these two peculiarities are combined in the 
ordinary match. 
So far we keep close to the perceptual and practic 
level. Though we are dealing with general relations 
we are presenting them in one concrete case. That 
further problems are left unsolved is evident, for the 
nature of the peculiarities has not been investigated. 
Nor could a child at the early age assumed profitably 
investigate them. That this is so is shown, indeed, by 
the fact that though he may recognize that this further 
enquiry might be made he has no desire to make it, He 
has carried explanation as far as he is capable of using it

\ the great majority of people never do attempt to attain 
\ more perfect explanation. 
Only so far as a mind is set to test its own suggestions, 
either by comparison with what it already knows or 
by a comparison of its own results. with independent — 
facts, is it trained in critical thought, or learning to 
estimate evidence. Here is a fruitful source of scholastic 
eror. For a young man it is certain that physical 
science is a most valuable mental discipline. In study- 
ing it he not only acquires knowledge which plays an 
incteasingly important part in modern life, but his learn- 
ing can, and should, be throughout a solving of problems, 
anda testing of his own suggestions. To assume that 
the subject will have the same value for mere boys is to 
ignore the essential differences between the stages of 
development reached by the two classes of pupils. 
A boy’s suggestions are mere guesses at truth, 
fowing naturally from the tendency of the undeveloped 
mind to generalize every one of its experiences—a ten- 
dency due to the fact that differences have not been 
thought explicitly. ‘To allow such guessing is to train 
in uncritical thought, that is, in the acceptance of any 
evidence which first comes to hand, without enquiry 
into its relevancy or adequacy. Yet, if the guessing be 
not permitted, the generalizations must be given by the 
teacher simply as statements of fact. If it be urged that 
generalizations should be excluded altogether, the answer 
is that this is hardly possible, and, if it were, the root of 
the objection would not be met. For such exclusion 
would reduce the aim of the teaching to the formal one 
of making the observations of the children more exhaus- 
tiveand more precise. This is to secure the learning of
-P-A-G-E-409
390 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
mere facts, and it must be insisted that unrelated facts 
are equally valueless whether learnt from observation or 
gathered from the speech of another. Facts, as facts, 
are only mental lumber, no matter whence the knowledge 
of them is derived. Only as they can be thought into 
a growing system of knowledge are they of any worth. 
It is because it is hard to teach thinking and easy 
to teach facts that schools have often cultivated stupidity 
instead of intelligence. ‘‘ The best of all teachers is one 
who does not merely state, nor even explain, the relations 
between facts, thereby doing little more than adding new 
facts to the rest, but who so guides his pupils that they 
are led to do their own thinking and make their own 
discoveries.” It is true that all teachers cannot become 
“the best,” but all can teach on the lines which lead to 
that pre-eminence. 
Stupidity may, then, be directly cultivated by making 
"a full memory of facts the one thing needful in school. 
It may be cultivated nearly as readily by calling for no 
real effort on the part of the pupils. This is a very 
prominent danger in the present day. The popular con- 
fusion between interest and recreative amusement, 
combined with an unduly low estimate of children’s 
powers and a kindly desire to avoid intellectual over- 
pressure, is responsible for much wasting of time and 
strength, and for much failure to train both character and 
intelligence. Intellectual over-pressure doubtless is 
possible, either because the memory of too many facts 
or the second-hand acquirement of too many demonstra 
tions is demanded. But when the work is the solving 
of problems felt as such by the mind of the learner, intel 
lectual over-pressure is scarcely possible with the young, 
1Archdall Reid : op. cit., 481.
-P-A-G-E-410

who are over-pressed from without, not from within. 
It is dad learning, not too much learning, which causes 
over-pressure ; and the over-pressure is then itself a.sign: 
of relative stupidity : it means that the mind fails to deal 
with what is presented to it. It is over-loaded because 
it is not nourished and exercised. : 
The calling for effort, however, must be for effort 
which is possible. Nothing develops stupidity more 
readily than a conviction of stupidity, and this soon arises 
when the problems set are outside the range of the child’s 
powers. Unhappily it is not superfluous to remark that 
for the teacher ever to express a judgement of stupidity 
is often unjust and always unwise. The apparent 
stupidity may be the result of bad teaching—bad in not 
being adapted to that individual capacity, if for no other 
teason. Moreover, it may be only apparent, and in any 
case its one possible cure is hopeful effort. To assure a 
. boy that he is dull discourages and impedes his efforts. 
If the assurance is believed the child is injured for life, 
for the very spring of effective action is weakened in him. 
Educative effort is, therefore, proportioned to the 
pupil’s strength. On the one hand, the requirements of 
learning should not be so small that he can master his 
lessons without real work, nor, on the other, so large 
that he stands confused and helpless before them. Here 
is one of the chief practical difficulties of teaching. It 
iseasy enough to lay down an abstract rule of graduation 
according to strength, but the virtue of such a rule—as 
of all educational maxims—lies in its application. No 
matter how well a teacher knows his pupils, it is not an 
tasy task to arrange that while one js not left to the 
frivolity of what to him is mere intellectual child’s play, 
another is not asked for efforts beyond his powers and
-P-A-G-E-411
392 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
which, therefore, he cannot put forth. To set always 
the same intellectual problems to a whole class, or to 
expect the same type of solutions from all its members, 
is to secure one, if not both, of these evils. 
All teaching which does not stimulate real and careful 
thinking makes for stupidity. It may be the stupidity 
which in later life shows itself in obstinate prejudice. 
Often this euphemistically disguises itself under the 
name of conscience, or of party loyalty. Its essence is 
that the mind is closed against all considerations which 
oppose its belief. Even facts must give way before it, 
or at any rate the record of unpalatable facts is not 
accepted. ‘‘The testimony is, in the receiver’s mind, 
of a low order ; the proposer is a radical, and the receiver 
is of opinion that a radical would pick a pocket ; or else, 
perhaps, the proposer is a tory, and the receiver is of the 
belief that a tory must have picked a pocket.”* 
Such an attitude of mind takes conviction as a test of 
truth, ignoring the fact that others hold exactly the 
opposite view with equally firm assurance. This form 
of stupidity is the natural outcome of too dogmatic a 
teaching. It is not merely that the teacher sets forth 
what he believes to be true, but that he encourages no 
investigation into the evidence on which that conviction 
rests. Such investigation is not a questioning of the 
truth itself. When a child who has learnt by various 
measurements certain geometrical relations is led to seek 
for the evidence on which he may safely believe that those 
relations hold universally, he is not questioning theit 
truth. Owing to the immaturity of the young and their 
little knowledge and experience their questionings must 
usually take this form. The attitude which is critical

-P-A-G-E-412
CRITICAL THOUGHT 393 
not only towards evidence but towards generally accepted 
truths comes later, when it comes at all. 
Yet it is good for even boys and girls to know that 
in many matters there is much to be said on both sides: 
in other words, that all opinions are not guaranteed 
truths. Immersed as they are in a definite social 
atmosphere, in which certain views of life and conduct 
ate accepted as matters of course, they are, of necessity, 
growing a fine crop of prejudices. It is. of no use to 
trust that the study of some rigidly demonstrative sub- 
ject, such as mathematics, will cultivate a suspicion of 
ungrounded assumptions in matters of life and conduct. 
It is just because mathematics is so. rigid that the form 
of reasoning cultivated by it is not easy to apply to the 
affairs of life, and when it is applied is more likely to 
lead us wrong than right. In this it is like formal logic. 
Life is too full and complex to be expressed in syllogisms 
So it is that quite reasonable people feel a distrust of 
such logic. ‘They recognize that inevitable as its con- 
clusions may be on the assumption of the truth and 
adequacy of its premises, yet that truth and adequacy 
generally cannot be granted. For example, setting forth 
with the assumption that cheapness is the greatest 
economic good, the advocates of Free Trade argue that 
competition open to the whole world will secure the 
greatest cheapness ; that, therefore, there should be no 
hindering custom duties. On the other hand, those wha 
advocate the imposition of import duties urge that abun- 
dance of regular employment is the greatest economic 
good, that such duties would encourage home produc- 
tion and so would necessarily increase employment ; 
therefore, that such duties should be levied. Each 
syllogism seems irresistible when taken alone and in
-P-A-G-E-413
394 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
detachment from the actual conditions of life. Yet we 
know that each conclusion is rejected by many of those 
who have really studied the subject. Of course, those 
who merely shout on the one side or the other because 
these matters have been made party cries simply 
exemplify the evil influence of prejudice. They count 
not at all at the bar of reason ; only at that of the polls. 
When we ask why either of these syllogisms fails to 
convince an opponent we find the first answer to be that 
its assumptions are not granted. The two major pre- 
mises are obviously incompatible, and each of the minors 
may bedisputed. The advocates of duties may urge that 
cheapness ultimately results from supply being in some 
excess of demand, and that if the imposition of import 
duties increase production at home it is quite possible 
that this increase may more than compensate for the 
foreign goods excluded. Or, on the other hand, the 
free traders may argue that duties by decreasing import 
trade would necessarily decrease the export trade which 
pays for it, that it is the export trade which gives most 
employment to our manufactures, and, therefore, that 
such duties would decrease employment. This is not 
the place to work out all the possible ramifications even 
of the economic arguments, and even if we did so the 
matter would still be unsettled, for no account would 
have been taken of national] or imperial sentiment. 
In such a case we feel that abstract arguments are 
mainly of worth for overthrowing an adversary, and that 
in this they are most effective when we first provide him 
hypothetically with the arguments we then proceed to 
refute. So it is in all that concerns the real affairs of 
life. Strictly logical argument is always abstract ; life 
is always concrete.
-P-A-G-E-414
CRITICAL THOUGHT 395 
It does not follow that the rigid reasoning rightly 
called logical: should be omitted from teaching; only 
that it should be confined to matter to which it is really 
applicable, and that its abstract and hypothetical character 
should be made plain. It is abstract in that it takes no 
account of any conditions which may interfere in reality 
with the aspect or relation it is examining. It is hypo- 
thetical in that its whole validity rests on certain assump- 
tions. To be clearly conscious of all we assume is neither 
usual nor easy. For example, the recognition that any 
assumptions have been made is often a real difficulty 
with children in solving geometrical problems or estab- 
lishing geometrical theorems. Good teaching makes a 
point of laying bare every assumption and of enquiring 
into its justification. 
So, too, the abstract character both of a strictly logical 
process and of its conclusions should be made quite 
explicit. The laws of motion, for example, are never 
really proved directly. Friction and the resistance of 
the air always interfere. But it can be seen that the 
more these are reduced the nearer the actual concrete 
results approach the hypothetical results of the abstract 
laws. Further, that from the assumption of the truth of 
these laws consequences can be deduced to which again 
experiment yields approximation in proportion as inter- 
fering agents are excluded. Thus it may be made plain 
that real concrete cases only approach the theoretical 
result, and that the degree of nearness could be calculated 
if we could measure the influence of all the interfering 
conditions. Then the use of delicate instruments 
becomes more apparent. 
In such a process of learning the pupil criticizes first his 
theoretical result, then his experiments, then the actual
-P-A-G-E-415
396 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
result they yield. Throughout he is trying to seck 
explanation, not in the loose sense of a broad and un- 
tested generalization, but in the application of such 
a generalization to facts. He does not doubt the law, 
but he examines critically the evidence which supports it. 
When, before working an experiment he predicts the 
result, not in general terms but with precision, he recog- 
nizes that his prediction is only probable, and that the 
degree of its probability depends on the accuracy with 
which he has gauged all the operative forces. 
Now, reasoning in concrete affairs is always of this 
probable character, and when the matter includes men 
and women as factors the task of setting forth all the 
conditions and estimating each at its true value is one 
which cannot be performed with precision. True, the 
mathematical theory of probability can deal with cases 
where all the possible alternatives can be known, as in 
the tossing of a coin or the casting of a die. But we 
cannot express human motives and deeds in fractions. 
All we can say as evidence accumulates in support of a 
certain proposition is that it becomes increasingly prob- 
able, till a degree of likelihood is reached which we 
commonly speak of as practical certainty, because it is 
universally regarded as a sufficient ground for action. 
“Te is by the strength, variety, or multiplicity of pre- 
mises, which are only probable, not by well-connected 
syllogisms,—by objections overcome, by adverse theories 
neutralized, by difficulties gradually clearing up, by 
exceptions proving the rule, by unlooked-for correlations 
found for received truths, by suspense and delay in the 
process issuing in triumphant reactions,—by all these 
ways, and many others, the practised and experienced 
mind is able to make a sure divination that a conclusion is

inevitable, of which his lines of reasoning do not actually 
put him in possession. This is what is meant by a pro- 
position being ‘as good as proved’, a conclusion. as 
undeniable ‘as if it were proved’, and the reasons for it 
‘amounting to a proof’, for a proof is the limit of 
probabilities.” 2 . 
In what way do schools begin to train the young in 
the estimation of such evidence as this? Generally, it 
is to be feared, the answer would be discouraging. Yet 
Ido not doubt that, even in primary schools, very valuable 
work can be done, mainly in connexion with the reading 
of books. The general mental attitude of the unprac- 
tised reader towards a book is one of receptive successive 
understanding ; the efforts of the learner are directed 
towards remembering the whole as fully as possible. 
This attitude becomes habitual unless some stimulus 
awaken the mind to the recognition that “‘some books 
ae to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few 
tobe chewed and digested ; that is, some books are to be 
read only in parts ; others to be read, but not curiously ; 
and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and 
attention.» 2 
Such stimulus it is the teacher's function to supply. 
When a passage in a book of Bacon’s last class is to be 
studied it should not simply be given out for reading, 
but the reading should be made a search for the answers 
to questions set by the teacher—questions which cannot 
be answered by merely copying a sentence or two from 
the book. The search for such answers trains the pupil 
to have a definite object in reading and so to put forth a 
more complete activity, to distinguish between what is

important for the purpose in hand and what is unessential, 
and so to get an idea of what constitutes evidence. The 
answering is a far surer test of what has really been learnt 
than is a reproduction of the whole, which may result 
from an activity little more than perceptual. 
In his very suggestive book, Srudies in the Teaching 
of History, Mr. Keatinge has given a number of 
examples of this kind of exercise applied to extracts from 
original historical documents, and in several places he 
has reproduced the actual answers written by pupils of 
thirteen years of age and upwards. The variety of 
problems that may be suggested is very great. After the 
pupils have learnt to find an answer to a direct question 
they may be set to estimate the worth of a piece of 
evidence by considering whether the writer shows party 
bias. For example, it is an easy matter, and one within 
the power of children of twelve or thirteen, to discover 
the nationality and the profession of the writer from the 
following extract from Roger of Wendover’s Flowers of 
History, of course given to the pupils anonymously : 
“Very grievous indeed was the downfall of our dear country 
England. . . . As aforetime on the inroads of the Danes, so now on 
the expulsion of the English by the Normans, the destruction of the 
people of the land was for the punishment of their sins; for the 
nobles, becoming enslaved to extravagance and the luxuries of the 
table, did not according to Christian custom seek the church of a 
morning. . . . The clergy too, and others in orders, were so wanting 
in learning that one who had learnt grammar was an object of 
wonder to all the rest ; all classes were alike given to drinking, and 
in this pursuit they spent days as well as nights. . . . However, these 
bad reports are not to be understood as referring to everybody.”! 
A direct problem suited for somewhat older pupils would 
be to find the purpose and the mode of the constitution

Exercises in comparison of evidence should not be 
given till some degree of expertness has been attained 
in more direct work. They should, however, never be 
omitted. The tendency to believe everything which 
appears in print, combined with the bias which keeps a 
man from reading anything which is opposed to his 
party views, is the foundation of the pernicious 
influence of party hacks of the baser sort, and accen- 
tuates the evils which a general power to read should 
mitigate. 
That even eye-witnesses may in all honesty give 
accounts of the same scene which differ a good deal even 
on important points can often be illustrated from school 
life. A simple exercise will, however, bring home the 
treachery of memory quite definitely. Let the teacher 
read inf private to one pupil a fairly long anecdote, and 
then request-him to write it out as accurately as possible, 
and desire him not to communicate with any of his class- 
mates on the subject. Let his written account be then 
read privately to the next boy and the same instructions 
be given to him, and so on till every boy has written 
what he remembers of what was read to him, each exer- 
cise being numbered according to its place in the series. 
We then have a series of versions, each of which was de- 
rived only from the preceding one and was the sole source 
of that which follows it. The reading to the whole class 
of the original story and of the last reproduction will bring 
home to its members with irresistible force that despite 
their efforts to be exact, much alteration has been actually 
made in the story. This will help them to conceive 4 
very healthy distrust of rumour and common report. If 
it be desired, the gradual rise of the error can be traced 
by comparing the exercises in order, but if this be done

great care must be taken not to throw suspicion: onthe 
good faith of any individual. reek 
Let it not be thought that this would be a waste a 
time. The lesson in the need of a critical attitude” 
towards testimony is invaluable. From many careful 
examinations of depositions made upon oath, M. Binet 
concludes that “‘it is established that when the deposition 
is made in good faith it is never entirely false, but only 
contains false details ; neither is it ever entirely exact from 
beginning to end. There is always a.mixture of truth 
and error ; and if the amount of error may become very 
small in many cases yet it hardly ever falls to,zero; and 
all the witnesses who have been tested are found to have 
afirmed upon oath false facts, in a proportion which may 
be approximately put at twenty-five per cent.”*~ To 
bring home to our pupils that the most perfect good faith 
cannot be taken as absolute proof of accuracy of state- 
ment is an admirable corrective to the natural: feeling 
that to doubt a piece of evidence in any one point is.to 
teject it as a whole, and to throw a doubt on the honesty 
of its author. 
To lead them by further comparison to see that bias 
will colour statements—whether consciously or uncon-- 
siously need not be determined, for that is'a matter of 
indifference in estimating the value of evidence—is still 
more to put their minds in that alert attitude which alone 
even attempts to sift the reports and current statements 
which play so large a part in our lives. A simple exercise 
of this kind would be to seek probable truth from a 
comparison of the two following extracts, the pupils 
knowing that the first is from a letter ‘of one of the 
most zealous of English bishops to the Pope, and the

second from a satirical poem written about a century later 
and intended rather to expose abuses than to paint a 
scrupulously fair and accurate picture— 
A. From a letter of Bishop Grosseteste to Pope Gregory IX. 
“Your Holiness may know of a surety that inestimable service hath 
been done in my diocese by the aforesaid brethren [#e. the Friars], 
For they enlighten our whole land with the bright light of preaching 
and doctrine. . . . O that your Holiness could see how devotedly 
and humbly the people run to hear the word of life, to confess their 
sins, to be instructed in the rules for daily life, how much profit the 
clergy and the monks take from the imitation of them ; you would 
immediately declare that to them that dwell in the shadow of death 
hath the light shined.” 
B. From Langland’s Vision of Piers Plowman, 
“1 found there Friars all the four orders, 
Who preached to the people for profit of themselves, 
And glozed the gospel as seemed good to them, 
And for covetousness of copes construed it as they wished. 
Many of these Master-Friars may clothe themselves as they pleas 
For their money and their merchandise march together.”! 
It is not only in history that material for training 
in the critical consideration of evidence may be found. 
Travellers’ tales furnish similar problems, especially whes 
an earlier is compared with a later writer, and the question 
arises how far the differences may be due to the lapse of 
time. In solving such problems the pupils should always 
be encouraged to bring to bear all of their knowledge 
which seems to them in any way pertinent, and not to hold 
themselves confined to the limits of the passages before 
them. That would be to fall into the same kind of 
narrow limitation of reference which causes formal logic 
to be so suspect in reference to the actual affairs of life.

CRITICAL THOUGHT © - 403 
Professor A. C. Bradley’s Lectures in Shakespearean 
Tragedy are full of literary problems arising out of | 
Shakespeare’s four greatest tragedies, many of. which . 
could profitably be studied by the older pupils in. .: 
secondary schools, and a few by the younger boys and ©. 
gil. As an example of the simpler we may take the 
discussion of the question whether Othello was black or 
brown— 
“Now I will not say that Shakespeare imagined him 
asa Negro and not as a Moor, for that might imply that 
he distinguished Negroes and Moors precisely as we 
do; but what appears to me nearly certain is that he 
imagined Othello as a black man, and not as.a light- 
brown one. 
“In the first place, we must remember that the brown 
orbronze to which we are now accustomed in the Othellos 
of our theatres is a recent innovation. Down to 
Edmund Kean’s time, so far as is known, Othello was 
always quite black. This stage-tradition goes back to 
the Restoration, and it almost settles our question. For 
itis impossible that the colour of the original Othello 
should have been forgotten so soon after Shakespeare’s 
time, and most improbable that it should have been 
changed from brown to black. 
“If we turn to the play itself, we find many references 
to Othello’s colour and appearance. Most of these are 
indecisive ; for the word ‘black? was of course used 
then where we should speak of a ‘dark® complexion 
tow; and even the nick-name ‘thick-lips’, appealed to 
% proof that Othello was a Negro, might have been 
‘plied by an enemy to what we call a Moor. On the 
other hand, it is hard to believe that, if Othello had 
hen light-brown, Brabantio would have taunted him
-P-A-G-E-423
404 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
with having a ‘sooty bosom’, or that...he himself 
would have used the words, 
“her name, that was as fresh 
As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black 
As mine own face.” 
“* These arguments cannot be met by pointing out that 
Othello was of royal blood, is not called an Ethiopian, 
is called a Barbary horse, and is said to be going to 
Mauritania. All this would be of importance if we had 
reason to believe that Shakespeare shared our ideas, 
knowledge and terms. Otherwise it proves nothing. 
And we know that sixteenth-century writers called any 
dark North-African a Moor, or a black Moor, or a 
blackamoor. Sir Thomas Elyot, according to Hunter, 
calls Ethiopians Moors ; and the following are the first 
two illustrations of ‘ Blackamoor’ in the Oxford English 
Dictionary : 1547, ‘1 am a blake More borne in Bar 
bary’; 1548, ‘ Ezhiopo, a blake More, or a man of 
Ethiope.”” Thus geographical names can tell us nothing 
about the question how Shakespeare imagined Othello... 
“ Titus Andronicus appeared in the Folio among Shake- 
speare’s works. It is believed by some good critics to 
be his: hardly anyone doubts that he had a hand in it: 
it is certain that he knew it, for reminiscences of it art 
scattered through his plays. Now no one who reads 
Titus Andronicus with an open mind can doubt that 
Aaron was, in our sense, black ; and he appears to have 
been a Negro.... Yet he is “Aaron the Moor’, just 
as Othello is ‘Othello the Moor’.... Shakespeare hin 
self in a single line uses ‘negro? and ‘Moor’ of the 
same person (Merchant of Venice, 11. v. 42). 
“The horror of most American critics... at the ideaof

ablack Othello is very amusing, and their arguments are 
highly instructive. But they were anticipated, I regret 
to say, by Coleridge, and we will hear him. . ‘No.doubt., 
Desdemona saw Othello’s visage in his mind; yet, as. 
we are constituted, and most surely as an English | 
audience was disposed in the beginning of the seven~" - 
teenth century, it would be something monstrous to 
conceive this beautiful Venetian girl falling-in love with 
averitable negro. It would argue a disproportionate- 
ness, a want of balance, in Desdemona, which Shake- 
speare does not appear to have in the least contemplated. 
Could any argument be more self-destructive?’ It 
actually did appear to Brabantio ‘something monstrous 
toconceive’ his daughter falling in love with Othello,— 
s0 monstrous that he could account for her love only by 
drugs and foul charms. And the suggestion that such 
love would argue ‘ disproportionateness’ is precisely the 
suggestion that Iago did make in Desdemona’s case: 
“Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank, 
Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.” 
...Thus the argument of Coleridge and others points 
straight to the conclusion against which they argue.”? 
The greatest benefit from such a passage will not 
result from its direct study. To the teacher it will be 
invaluable as a guide, but with this help he should 
endeavour to lead his pupils to attempt_to do the work 
of collecting, comparing and weighing the evidence as 
fir as possible by themselves. The point to be decided 
canbe set asa problem. The references to it in the play 
should then be hunted out and set forth as arguments on 
the one side or the other. ‘The teacher can then add to 
1 Shakespearean Tragedy, pp.. 198-201.

406 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
the evidence by giving the illustrative passages from 
Elyot and the English Dictionary. Each pupil will by 
this time lean to one side or the other. The teacher then 
states the evidence about the custom of the theatre, but 
leaves his pupils to estimate its bearing on their pro- 
visional conclusion. If as a result all do not draw the 
same conclusion as probable, the position of the minority 
may be discussed. At the end it may be well to sum 
marize the arguments somewhat as Mr Bradley has done. 
But it is not at all the teacher’s place to insist dogmati- 
cally on the acceptance of his own conclusions: that 
would be to hinder, not to aid, the growth of critical 
power. 
The attempt to decide literary questions largely on 
grounds of literary taste is, of course, only possible with 
pupils old enough and artistic enough to feel the con- 
sonance or incongruity of passage with passage. Again 
to take an example from Professor Bradley. Is the 
Fool’s prophecy in rhyme at the end of King Lear, Act m. 
sc. ii, genuine or spurious—an addition made by the 
‘players? Professor Bradley holds it to be spurious on 
the following grounds, in addition to the fact that “the 
speaker remains behind alone to utter the words after the 
other persons have gone off °— 
“(1) The scene ends characteristically without the 
lines, (2) They are addressed directly to the audience. 
(3) They destroy the pathetic and beautiful effect of the 
immediately preceding words of the Fool, and also of 
Lear’s solicitude for him. (4) They involve the ab 
surdity that the shivering timid Fool would allow his 
master and protector, Lear and Kent, to go away into 
the storm and darkness, leaving him alone. (5) It is 
also somewhat against them that they do not appear in

the Quartos. At the same time I do not think :one. 
would hesitate to accept them if they occurred at any 
natural place within the dialogue.” * 
Such an instance of reasoning which is felt by a come 
petent critic to be conclusive admirably illustrates the” 
impossibility of expressing all the factors which influence 
our judgement in the explicit terms demanded Py formal 
logic. 
Another advantage which results from: such a critical 
thinking of books is a nicer perception of the exact force 
of words. The enormous increase in the output of 
printed matter during the last century has led to.a very 
considerable lowering of the standard of precise expres- 
sion among public writers. This has naturally reacted 
on the readers, till many words are commonly so general- 
wed that they cease to mean anything in particular. 
What sense can a rational mind attach to a statement 
that something is “‘awfully nice?? While writing this 
thapter I saw a newspaper placard announcing an article 
on “State Organization the Secret of Germany’s Pros- 
perity,” where, presumably, “‘cause” was meant, for 
certainly the State Organization of Germany has nevet 
been, nor could possibly be, a ‘‘secret”. 
It is difficult to say how far a loose use of language 
teacts on thought, but it is certain that it does so react, 
and that it tends to form a habit of slovenly thinking 
and of being satisfied with a grasp of meaning which 
is more often than not distorted as well as superficial. 
A minute examination of isolated words by way of 
definition helps but little to correct the fault. As has 
been already pointed out, a definition is quite a special 
and technical abstract of meaning. ‘‘No one from the 
106. cit., pp. 451 and 452.

408 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
sight of a horse or a dog would be able to anticipate its 
zoological definition, nor from a knowledge of its defini- 
tion to draw such a picture as would direct another to the 
living specimen.”' The attempt to express the real 
meaning of a passage by a synthesis of definitions of the 
words employed is in essence the same as dealing with 
thought on concrete subjects by formal logic alone. 
Indeed, formal logic actually makes the demand that each 
term shall be used in an unvarying and abstract sense. | 
But real thought uses language rather than words; and | 
in language the sense is found as a whole in the whole. 
It is not an artificial building up of separate stones of | 
meaning each with its own unvarying shape. In any 
fine expression of thought the change of a single word 
affects the whole sense, and the whole sense colours the 
meaning of each single word. The artistic use of 
language, therefore, does not depend on a clear appre- 
hension of definitions but on a sense of the appropriate- 
ness of each word in some particular context. In this 
connexion I cannot refrain from quoting an admirable 
passage from Guizot’s History of Civilization in Europe: 
“There is almost always in the usual acceptation of the 
most general terms more accuracy than in the definitions, 
apparently more strict, more precise, of science. It is 
common sense which gives to words their ordinary sig- 
nification, and common sense is the characteristic of | 
humanity. The ordinary signification of a word is 
formed by gradual progress, and in the constant presence 
of facts; so that when a fact presents itself which seems 
to come within the meaning of a known term, it is 
received into it, as it were, naturally ; the signification 
of the term extends itself, expands, and by degrees, the

CRITICAL THOUGHT .*:" 409 
various facts, the various ideas which from ‘the nature 
of the things themselves men.should include under! this 
word, are included. a 
“When the meaning of a word, on the other handy 
is determined by science, this determination, the work of: 
one individual, or of a small number of individuals, takes 
place under the influence of some particular: fact which 
has struck upon the mind. Thus scientific definitions 
are, in general, much more narrow, and, hence, much less 
accurate, much less true, at bottom, than the popular 
meanings of the terms. In studying as a fact the mean- 
ings of the word civilization, in investigating all the. 
ideas which are comprised within it, according to the 
common sense of mankind, we shall make'a much greater 
progress towards a knowledge of the fact itself, than by 
attempting to give it ourselves a scientific definition, 
however more clear and precise the latter might appear 
at first? 2 
The very exercise, then, of finding an exact meaning 
ina given passage and of expressing it tersely and 
accurately ensures that care is taken to use language with 
some precision. ‘The teacher in criticizing the pupils’ 
answers should always be on the watch to detect looseness 
and ambiguity, and should lead the writer to enquire and 
to discover how the words he has used have distorted or 
misrepresented his meaning. 
The loose use of words to which we are 1 unfortunately 
so much accustomed is a sure sign of the wide diffusion 
of loose and superficial thought. People who have no 
clear meaning to convey do not feel the need for a delicate 
instrument of expression. One does not require a 
Sientific balance to weigh a pound of sugar or a ton of

coals. This superficiality is a mark of stupidity just as 
surely as is narrow prejudice and the vitiation of thought 
by strong party bias. For stupidity is always inability 
to deal with problems. The prejudiced man cannot see 
the force of arguments which make against his convic- 
tions; the superficial man cannot see the force of any 
arguments at all which go beneath the surface of things. 
The prejudiced man can only draw conclusions in his 
own mind from premises in harmony with his preposses- 
sions: the superficial man cannot really reason at all ; he 
either accepts the opinions and adopts the conclusions 
of those immediately about him, or his shifting views 
are tinged by his moods and whims. He is a veritable 
mental chameleon. 
Whether a teaching which does not call forth thought 
produces the narrow or the shallow type of stupidity 
depends upon its character. Dogmatic teaching which 
bases every statement on authority and allows no investi- 
gation of evidence tends to develop the former. Teach- 
ing which aims at outward brightness—interest, falsely 
so called—and at removing all difficulties and calls for 
effort, with equal certainty cultivates the latter. In each, 
the nutriment offered to the mind consists of facts; in 
the one case stated, in the other observed. But as in 
neither case are the facts made into problems the solution 
of which is to be sought by the personal investigation 
of the pupils, so in neither case is intelligence cultivated. 
Each in place thereof cultivates stupidity in an approptt- 
ate form; though, doubtless, some individuals subjected 
to the one form of teaching may show in later life mainly 
the other form of stupidity. That simply means that 
inborn nature has been too strong for artificial training, 
and that, consequently, that training has rather passed 
over the mind than entered into it.
-P-A-G-E-430
CRITICAL THOUGHT . 41 
Inborn stupidity shows itself in a marked mental 
inertia. When this is really general ordinary education 
aan do very little. But more often it appears only in 
cettain directions, and these not infrequently coincide 
with the traditional school studies. The remedy is. to 
find in what ways natural interest shows itself, and to 
make those the fulcrum of efforts to move the mass. It 
cannot be too strongly urged that to neglect*this is to 
develop general stupidity instead of what is, at the worst, 
pattial stupidity. Practical intelligence is often found 
united with theoretical obtuseness, just as a keen intel- 
lect is not infrequently accompanied by practical inepti- 
tude. A sane judgement despises neither. Nor is it 
reasonable that scholastic opinion should confine its 
admiration to intellectual acuteness and should brand as 
stupidity all failure in that, quite regardless of the possi- 
bility of an equally important excellence on the practical 
and constructive side. A real study of psychology 
should help teachers to see that the traditional intel- 
lectualism of the schools is narrowly one-sided, and so 
is itself a sign of stupidity. And perhaps no stupidity 
isso hard to overcome as that intellectual stupidity which 
takes intellect as the one measure of life. This pedantry 
of the schools must be overthrown before a really syste- 
matic attempt will be made to check the cultivation of 
stupidity among the people.

CHAPTER XII 
IDEALS 
Man is not bound down to the hard reality of the 
present. Amid much that is petty, even it may be 
sordid, in the daily task, much that dulls by its mono- 
tony, and much that depresses by its failure, he yet looks 
forward with hope and aspiration to brighter visions. 
Whatever his present condition 
“Man partly is and wholly hopes to be.” ? 
Even the dullest clod has his fairy vision. It may bea 
narrow, even a degrading, one; yet it is to him the 
light which brightens his path, for it shows him a picture 
which to his mind is better than the reality of his life. 
He may limit his hopes to sensuous pleasure, to increase 
of wealth, to ignoble revenge ; but the hope inspires him 
whatever it may be. On the other hand, one’s aspira- 
tions may soar to heaven and inspire the earnest struggle 
of the saint, or seek in highest art the realization of 
supremest beauty, or in social service the noblest per- 
fection of human life. 
Hope, then, is a reaching forward in spirit to some- 
thing which is different from the actual, yet which we 
can see in imagination. We can imagine absent scenes ” 
and things when they are vividly described tous. Then

the imagination works under direction:; it, as it were, 
imitates the description given. The scene we imapine, 
however, exists for us not only in imagination but/in 
belief. We picture it, and on the evidence of others we ~ 
pronounce it real either in the present or in the past. 
This, too, is the nature of the imaginings of young 
children. They picture in fancy all kinds of objects 
and events, to us incongruous and incredible, but by no 
means impossible to them, nor, indeed, ‘to our fore- 
fathers. The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries found 
no difficulty in believing as well ‘as imagining such 
descriptions as—‘‘ The griffin is a beast-with wings, and 
is four footed: and breedeth in the mountains Hyper- 
borean, and is like to the lion in all the parts of the body, 
and to the eagle only in the head and wings. And 
gtifins keep the mountains in which be gems and 
precious stones, and suffer them not to be taken from 
thence.» The twentieth century smiles in tolerant 
pity at the ignorance and credulity of the middle ages, 
which could accept such tales. . But really the only 
foundation for our own want of faith is increased know- 
ledge of the earth and its inhabitants. Despite that, 
an immense number of people a few years ago accepted 
without demur the “flying wombats” of that inventive 
author of travellers’ tales ‘‘ M. de Rougemont.” 
The mental process of constructing in imagination 
such a picture is the same whether it represent a reality 
ora fancy. Indeed, it would be impossible to decide 
which it did represent unless it could be constructed ; for 
till that has been done we have not the object present to 
our criticism.

Such a mental construction is essentially a combination 
of meanings. Whether it take the form of a visual 
image is, as has already been pointed out, a matter of 
individual idiosyncrasy. 
Our belief in our constructions is, then, limited by 
our knowledge, or, perhaps it would be more accurate 
to say, by our other beliefs. For, indeed, most of us 
would have to use ‘knowledge’ very loosely to say that 
it is knowledge which prevents us individually from 
believing in the existence of the griffin. 
It is a different question, however, as to how the 
fiction of a griffin first arose. Was it deliberate inven- 
tion? Did some poetical traveller or writer of travels 
imagine it by putting together qualities and attributes 
of known beasts? That seems certainly to have been 
the genesis ‘of the flying wombats. If so, probably the 
origin was a desire to amaze the credulous, or to givea 
touch of life to a picture of strange lands, unchecked by 
adequate knowledge of the actualities of nature. Ordid 
the griffin result from an imperfect perception—a per- 
ception, it may be, obscured by terror? We all know 
how terror, especially of the unknown, makes people see 
the non-existent, and changes the most harmless objects 
into the most fearsome portents. Historically we cannot 
answer the question as to the griffin, or in any other 
particular case. But when one reads the travellers’ tales 
of a few hundred years ago one is inclined to adopt as 
the most plausible hypothesis that both mistaken per- 
ception and deliberate enrichment of reality had been 
at work, 
The point is this. Whatever origin we may think 
most probable for such imaginings, we must note that 
the creature imagined was never outside nature in aoy

of its qualities, but only in their combination. Assum- 
ing, as we must surely assume in some cases, the 
deliberate fabrication of monsters, and remembering that 
| the ignorance of geography in the middle ages, the 
traditional belief in magic, the absence of scientific 
explanation of the most ordinary natural phenomena, 
all made people eager for marvels, we may regard it as 
cettain that the constructed creatures were made as 
terrible and fantastic as possible. The conclusion that 
al human imagination is bound to reality is irresistible. 
It may, indeed, see reality transfigured with a glory not 
itsown—a glory which the divine light of hope sheds on 
our path. Has not each one of us imagined a coming 
event—a holiday, it may be, or the making of a speech— 
and seen it in colours much more roseate than the actual 
event justified? Have we not, on the other hand, 
anticipated evil which has never come, or which coming 
has proved to be by no means unbearable? “‘ Coming 
events cast their shadows before”, but the shadow is not 
always of the same colour as the event. 
It is by no means implied that increase of knowledge 
checks imagination. As the raw material of every 
imagined product is simply the known, it follows that 
the greater the knowledge the wider the possibilities of, 
imagination. So, for the crude suggestions of the savage 
ae substituted the wide hypotheses of modern science, 
and the simple expressions of primitive emotions of 
early writers are replaced by the complex analyses of 
tharacter of the modern poet and novelist. ‘‘ The great 
dramatist makes none of his characters out of nothing. 
If they live, they must all be based upon what he knows 
of other men and what he knows of himself. And his 
knowledge of other men is, in turn, based upon his
-P-A-G-E-435
416 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
knowledge of himself. For that is the only complete 
knowledge of human nature that he can attain to. He 
observes, and divines the meaning of what he observes, 
by a scientific process, for in other men he sees only out- 
ward symptoms. In himself he can connect these 
outward symptoms with the inward operations of his 
mind ; and so he comes to understand the inward opera- 
tions of other men’s minds by supposing the same 
connexion. ‘Thus his experience helps his observation, | 
and his observation helps him to understand the signifi- 
cance of tendencies in his own mind that are perhaps | 
constantly suppressed. Out of those suppressed ten- 
dencies he will make many of his characters, imagining | 
them not suppressed but favoured by circumstances 
different from his own and free from his own inhibitions. 
-..For imagination is encouraged and enriched by 
knowledge of all kinds, and flags for the want of it 
Knowledge is, as it were, the soil by which the flower 
of imagination is nourished ; and, the greater the writer, 
the greater his passion for knowledge and the more ust 
he can make of all that he knows.” 
The play of imagination round the circumstances of 
our life is as natural as is the perception of the objects 
actually present to us. Certainly, as with every other 
human power, there are personal variations both in its 
strength and in its form, but absent it never is. It is 
impossible to limit life to reality and to banish all imagi- 
nation. To do so would, indeed, even if it were possible, 
be the most cruel blow that could be inflicted on man- 
kind. Take away all we hope and long for, hide from | 
our spiritual gaze all that is nobler, better, and more 
beautiful than the common things of our work-a-day

life, and we are reduced in all essentials to the level of 
the beasts. For us, as for them, this life is all, and this 
life is confined to the sensuous experiences of the 
moment. The most distinctively human gift of 
tumanity is the power to conceive a good not yet 
attained ; perhaps never to be attained. So for each one 
of us it is a ‘‘ great truth that it is our best moments— 
not our worst—that reveal our real selves: that if we 
would judge righteous judgement, we must appraise a 
man according to the good that he would and did not, 
nther than according to the evil that he would not and 
yet did”? Indeed, the whole progress of the human 
nace has been due to its imaginings of better things, and 
its efforts to make those imaginings'real. The treasures 
ft us by the past—whether it be art or literature or 
music or law or social organization or morality or religion 
~are all embodiments of imagination. Without imagi- 
tation man can conceive nothing higher than himself. 
To him God Himself could not reveal Himself, for 
the revelation could neither be received nor under- 
stood. 
If, then, imagination be an integral part of human 
tature, and so valuable an one withal, if it can work only 
with what it knows, if its direction be determined by the 
desires and interests of life, then education fails woefully 
fit neglect to deal with it. For, like all our powers, 
ttmay be exercised on unworthy matter.

Thus fallen have earth’s greatest Gogmagogs, 
Who dazzle us, whom we can not revere: 
Imagination is the charioteer 
That, in default of better, drives the hogs.’’! 
A sadly inadequate apprehension of human nature 
and its needs underlay the so-called ‘ practical? conception — 
of education which was so prevalent in the middle of the 
last century, and which in its spirit and essence was not 
exaggerated by Charles Dickens when he made Mr 
Gradgrind expound his views on the subject— 
“Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and 
girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in 
life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. 
You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon 
Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them.... 
“You are to be in all things regulated and governed... 
by fact....You must discard the word Fancy alto- 
gether. You have nothing to do with it. You are not 
to have, in any object of use or ornament, what would 
be a contradiction in fact. You don’t walk upon flowers 
in fact ; you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in 
carpets. You don’t find that foreign birds and butter- 
flies come and perch upon your crockery; you cannot 
be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon 
your crockery. You never meet with quadrupeds going 
up and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds 
represented upon walls. You must use... for all these 
purposes, combinations and modifications (in primary 
colours) of mathematical figures which are susceptible 
of proof and demonstration. This is the new discovery. 
This is fact. This is taste.” ? |

We smile now at the philistinism of it all. But it 
was a very real thing to millions of children whose 
mental food was, in deference to the prevailing material- 
istic utilitarianism, restricted to the ‘‘three Rs”, and 
even what they read confined as closely as possible to 
bald statements of fact. What could be the result but 
alowering of the love of all that is bright and beautiful, 
and an increased tolerance of all that is ugly and dismal? - 
One does not find many traces of “‘ merrie England” in 
the slums of a big manufacturing town, and too often 
one sees the imagination acting, in one way or another, 
ws the “‘charioteer that drives the hogs.” 
Amid the squalor and hideousness which surround 
thousands of lives it is hard indeed for the divine spark of 
imagination to fly upwards. Imagination can only work 
with materials gathered from experience, and so for many 
achild it is confined to the sordid and the base, except so 
faras the school supplies the deficiencies of the life outside 
itswalls, For in life what is the present but an incentive? 
“Man never is, but always 0 de blest ;”? 
and the form of the blessing he desires and esteems is moulded by his daily experiences. To seize the best 
tlements in the present and to make them the stepping- 
Stones to the future is the true secret of life. 
“He fixed thee mid this dance 
OF plastic circumstance, 
This Present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest :

Yet how seldom does the future fulfil our anticipations, 
Are we then to despair? Many do, and forget that 
what was future is now present, and, like the former 
present, infused with promise of a further future. 
“Ah, but a man’s reach should exceed his grasp, 
Or what’s a heaven for?” 
‘is true at every moment. 
“Then life is—to wake not sleep, 
Rise and not rest, but press 
From earth’s level where blindly creep 
Things perfected, more or less, 
To the heaven’s height, far and steep.”? 
All despair, all turning aside from the narrow way of 
the struggle towards perfection, means a failure in imagi- 
nation—a losing hold of what we have hitherto regarded 
as for us the ideal of life. To put it in another way: it 
is the strength of our ideals which is transfused into our 
efforts. So that, while an ideal is imaginative in its 
transcendence of reality yet it is at the same time inspitt 
tion. We may, indeed, say that every ideal is a purpose 
embedded in feeling and transmuted by imagination into 
something higher and better than experience has given 
us. Of course, the ideal of one may be the realized 
present of another, and the ideals of a child are neces 
sarily below the accomplishments of mankind. But to 
him whose ideal it is, an ideal is always beyond the reality 
of his experience. So it is the spur of his efforts. 
The loss of ideals is, then, the loss of power and, 
what is worse, the loss of desire for power. This is the 
very essence of degradation of life.

“Let a man contend to the uttermost 
For his life’s set prize, be it what it will! 
And the sin I impute to each frustrate ghost 
Is—the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin.” 
Yes, “‘the unlit lamp” of imagination means “the 
ungirt loin” of noble effort. 
Yet there is a temptation to those of emotional and 
sensitive temperament and in whom the spring of action 
is weak to rest content with beautiful imaginings. Their 
souls are satisfied with unreality ; they love to be specta- 
tors at a beauteous phantasmagoria, not combatants in 
the fierce turmoil of life. Such persons often find it 
tasy to take a cheerful view of life, because they instinc- 
tively turn from what is painful and distressing to them. 
Not because they have faith in the ultimate triumph of 
good over the actual evil of the present, but because 
they ignore that evil, they are able to say 
“T find earth not grey but rosy, 
Heaven not grim but fair of hue. 
Do I stoop? I pick a posy. 
Do I stand and stare? All’s blue.” ? 
A far saner optimism may be felt by him who yet 
Weeps over the actual evil, but whose soul is sustained 
by the living faith that 
“‘God’s in his heaven— 
All’s right with the world!” 8 
The mere fact of optimism is not a proof of any 
such living faith. But that alone it is which drives to

effort to help to accomplish the Divine purpose to right 
the wrong. 
The difference, then, between an imaginative painting 
of life and an ideal is of the utmost importance. The 
former refuses to see things as they are and rests un- 
moved amid evil and misery, because, real though they 
are, they are excluded from the fancy picture. Such 
imagination inspires to no effort, because it does not 
represent something different from the actual and more 
desirable than it, but, on the contrary, pretends to show 
the actual as it is. On the other hand, a true ideal knows 
itself as unreal in the present, but sees itself as a goal 
which by effort may be approached, if not actually reached, 
by setting out from the present, and in no other way. 
Keeping this quite clearly in mind let us now return 
to the sensitive temperament, indisposed to active inter- 
position in the hard facts of life. Without doing despite 
to its nature it may yet be of much service to mankind; 
in inspired souls, indeed, of more service than the active 
brother. For such souls are the poets and the prophets of 
humanity. They, more truly than others, see the ideal 
and the way towards it; their eyes pierce more deeply 
into the mystery of existence, and more effectively do 
they hold a light to guide men’s steps. The practical 
man works here and now; the poet also works, but he 
works for all time and for every place. 
“Tis one thing to know, and another to practise. 
And thence I conclude that the real God-function 
Is to furnish a motive and injunction 
For practising what we know already.” 
So it is that the poets have formed men’s lives much 
1 Browning: Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day, xvii. 
 
-P-A-G-E-442
IDEALS 423 
more than the philosophers. Their appeal has been 
universal, to all that is in men, while that of the philo- 
sophers has been almost entirely addressed to the intellect. 
The poet, too, has the insight that comes by divine gift 
to see into the heart of things. And what he sees he 
utters, regardless of whether he can give a logical 
demonstration of it. But philosophy must be proved, or 
itis put out of court. So it is only when a philosopher 
is also a poet, as was Plato, that he has exercised much 
permanent influence over the mass of mankind. 
Nor is the poetic soul confined to those whose power 
of tuneful expression of the thoughts and imaginings 
within them has won general attention and earned the 
name of poet. All emotional temperaments are in their 
degree poetic. All can sing— 
“Thoughts hardly to be packed 
Into a narrow act, 
Fancies that broke through language and escaped ; 
All I could never be, 
All, men ignored in me, 
This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped.” ! 
Yet day-dreaming is a real danger, for it may lead to the 
sentimentality of which we spoke above. ‘The educator 
must, therefore, try in every possible way to prompt 
hildren of such a temperament to find some outward 
Means of expressing their visions which shall bless others 
4s well as themselves. 
There is no limit to the actual formation of ideals, and 
they are of all degrees of worth and importance. Any- 
thing we imagine as worthy to be done is to us an ideal. 
There is, indeed, a more restricted use of the term whith 
limits it to the great thoughts of life—the ideals of 
1 Browning : Rabbi ben Ezra, xxv.
-P-A-G-E-443
424 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
goodness, of beauty, and of truth. These we think as 
unattainable but not unapproachable, and the essential 
work of humanity is to draw gradually nearer to them. 
Such approach is step by step through smaller ideals. 
Ultimately to the eye of faith they are one, though in 
actual human experience they have hitherto failed to 
coincide. Nay more, these ultimate goods must in some 
way be of a nature identical with the actual world, 
with all its imperfections plain to immediate experience. 
Nor need this stagger us. It is the very essence of an 
ideal to be better than the real to which it is related, and 
to be better by abolishing its imperfections. So, faith 
in the ultimate goodness, truth, and beauty, of the uni- 
verse is in no way inconsistent with a full recognition of 
present evils. It is, indeed, the origin of all striving 
to remove them ; for it gives a spring of action which 
is absolutely inexhaustible. 
“O world, as God has made it! All is beauty: 
And knowing this, is love, and love is duty. 
What further may be sought for or declared ?”? 
Though we have here passed far beyond the ideals of 
achild we have not left our proper subject. For the higher 
ideals may be those of every adult, and should emphati- 
cally be those of every educator, whether parent or teacher. 
For surely it is the essential function of education 
“To have to do with nothing but the true, 
The good, the eternal—and these, not alone 
In the main current of the general life, 
But small experiences of every day, 
Concerns of the particular hearth and home.”* 
1Browning : The Guardian-Angel. 
2 Browning : The Ring and the Book, vi., 2089-2093-
-P-A-G-E-444
IDEALS 425 
To look thus on one’s work, to be surrounded by such 
a atmosphere, to strive towards such ideals is to be a 
true educator and a true inspirer. For the ideals which 
shape the life of parent or teacher are daily more and 
more evident to the child, and help to mould his life for 
good or evil. As like tends to like, the good within 
him feels the attraction of fine ideals; the evil draws 
into itself strength from low and mean ideals. 
So it is that the teacher’s lofty ideals are the most 
powerful influences the school can bring to bear to 
counteract the evil of sordid and degraded surroundings. 
W these be absent all others must be of no effect. 
Most obvious and most true is this in all ideals of 
conduct and of thought—in all those which represent the 
good and the true. In what concerns the beautiful the 
teacher’s own enthusiasms will be wasted unless life 
supply the pupil with materials with which to work. 
He cannot make bricks without both straw and clay. 
Inall that enters through the ear—beauty of thought 
ad expression—the teacher can act. The choice of 
What he reads to the pupils, or allows them to read in 
xhool, depends on him ; if he will he can unobtrusively 
but largely direct their choice of recreative reading out 
of school. This is a vast influence, for from their 
hvourite books many boys and girls gather ideals of 
tonduct more potent than from their personal acquaint- 
aces, For imagination has a freer play round the

hey can more easily be made embodiments of single 
qualities, which thus stand out in all possible impressive- 
tess, and become objects of ardent devotion or of hearty 
detestation. Many children have as many and as well-
-P-A-G-E-445
426 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
known friends in the realm of fancy as in that of fact; 
friends quite as influential on their outlook on life. 
The influence of music is much less definite than that 
of literature. On some, however, its emotional effect 
is very great ; it soothes in trouble, it inspires to effort, 
it fills the heart with vague longings. Such an effect 
cannot be analysed, for it belongs to that half-conscious 
life in which emotion has its seat. On the other hand, 
vulgar, trivial, and insipid music attunes the soul to 
itself. 
The tendency of teachers is to ignore all those in- 
definite effects which cannot be directly estimated. Yet 
it needs but little knowledge of our own lives to assure 
us that we are by no means exclusively guided by what 
is most prominent in our thoughts. Whence comes the 
strength of ourimpulses? Often we cannot say. They 
are rooted in our nature and have gathered force in our 
lives, and with the cumulative strength of many for- 
gotten indulgences they sweep away the barriers of 
caution and raze the dam of new resolve. We cannot 
analyse the influence of music, nor of other forms of art, 
on this underground life of ours—this reservoir of possi- 
bilities which at times bursts forth with volcanic violence, 
at others sends out the steady irresistible overflow of the 
lava stream of firm purpose. But on artistic tempera- 
ments in general, and on those that are musical in 
particular, it is great, while on all not insensible to music 
it counts for something. 
In music, as in more appropriate spheres, schools have 
generally confined themselves to results which can be 
directly appraised. The children are usually taught to 
sing ; often still more attention is paid to practising them 
in reading music. So far this is well, provided that the
-P-A-G-E-446
IDEALS . 427 
music chosen be good. But would it not also be well 
that, whenever means are available, opportunity should 
ve made for the direct influence through the ear of music 
much beyond the children’s executive skill? Some 
suggestiveness may be found in Milton’s proposal that 
the intervals of school life “‘ may both with profit and 
| delight be taken up in recreating and composing their 
tavail’d spirits with the solemn and divine harmonies of 
Musick heard or learnt ; either while the skilful Organist 
plies his grave and fancied descant, in lofty fugues, or 
te whole Symphony with artful and unimaginable 
touches adorn and grace the well studied chords of some 
choice Composer, sometimes the Lute, or soft Organ 
stop waiting on elegant Voices either to Religious, 
martial, or civil Ditties ; which if wise men and Prophets 
benot extreamly out, havea great power over dispositions 
aid manners, to smooth and make them gentle from 
nstick harshness and distemper’d passions.” ? 
In all that instils beauty through the eye the town 
dhild is generally at a disadvantage as compared with the 
country child, and the child from a town slum most 
tmphatically so. It is true that before adolescence most 
thildren have little conscious appreciation of beauty, and 
that they will call a picture of a landscape “‘ pretty” when 
they will pass by the landscape itself without observation 
comment. Their power of seeing wholes is limited. 
The picture is small and within their grasp, the landscape 
istoo large for them ; they appreciate only small pieces 
ofit, and the younger they are the smaller are the pieces. 
Stl there are small beauties in nature as well as large 
ones. No doubt a town child who seldom sees a flower 
tn more easily be roused to explicit admiration of a 
1 Tractate on Education.

428 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
primrose or a daisy than can a country child. That is 
largely the result of novelty awakening surprise and 
wonder, and not mainly the expression of a feeling of 
appreciation of beauty. Even waiving this, the import- 
ant thing seems to me to be not the explicit and transient 
impression but the implicit toning of the mind by sur- 
roundings. Again it is the effect which cannot be 
measured that is most to be desired. As boyhood and 
girlhood give way to adolescence it is especially desirable 
that the growing soul be surrounded by the calm in- 
fluences of nature. 
“From Nature doth emotion come, and moods 
Of calmness equally are Nature’s gift.””! 
Modern life tends to obscure that influence of sur- 
roundings to which the opinion of ancient times attached 
so great an importance. Probably, indeed, it tends to. 
decrease it. We are all so busy that from moment to 
moment the present claims us, and the placid influences 
of nature have little opportunity to work in us. Yet 
surely there is truth in Mr Fotheringham’s words: 
“Those of us who have scarcely ever seen the dawn, 
or felt the freshness of the morning, who have scarcely 
ever stood under the open sky and seen some wide land- 
scape full of light and air, who have never felt the loneli- 
ness and peace of nature in quiet places, who have never 
in some still hour stood under the arch of the midnight 
sky alone—such, and there are not a few of them in our 
towns to-day, miss not only precious knowledge of the 
great world, but knowledge of themselves—of the heart, 
and the high powers of emotion and thought.” ?

The more a child is removed from nature the more 
important it is that he should be open to a similarly 
constant influence of art. The responsibility here thrown 
upon the town school for the children of the poor is 
obvious, especially if the town be of the manufacturing 
type. To live in Oxford is to be surrounded by archi- 
tectural beauty ; to live in a town full of factories, forges, 
ind mean streets, is to be hemmed in by artificial ugliness. 
Even the beauty of sky and fleecy cloud is shut out by 
murky smoke. Often the country is miles away, and 
when reached is scarred by mines if not sterilized by 
wisome fumes. The only spot of beauty is, perhaps, 
apublic park. 
The school in such circumstances has a most uphill 
tuk if it attempt to give its pupils some material on 
Thich imagination may work in constructing ideals of 
beauty of form and colour. At least there should be 
vel-proportioned and well-lighted buildings, cheerful 
and artistic, though simple, in their decorations. Plants 
and flowers tended by the children, and a few good 
pictures and casts within the reach of their appreciation— 
to which more specific attention may be drawn at times by 
informal chats in which taste may be subtly influenced— 
ue probably within the reach of all schools. Certainly 
alcan banish from the walls grisly anatomical diagrams, 
whether of man or beast, and hideous vulgar daubs, and 
il can insist on neatness in everything within the school 
buildings. 
These are, of course, only hints and suggestions. But 
tvidently it is perfectly useless to consider how an ideal 
may develop if there be no material in experience on 
Which the imagination can seize, and which it can trans- 
frm according to its desire. It is from this point of
-P-A-G-E-449

view that surroundings are seen to be so vitally important. 
“We would not”, said Plato of old, “‘have our 
guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity, as 
in some noxious pasture, and there browse and feed upon 
many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little by 
little, until they silently gather a festering mass of cor- 
ruption in their own soul. Let our artists rather be 
those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the 
beautiful and graceful ; then will our youth dwell ina 
land of health, amid fair sights and sounds, and receive 
the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence of 
fair works, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health- 
giving breeze from a purer region, and insensibly draw 
the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy 
with the beauty of reason.” } 
That all ideals are connected primarily with doing, 
with feeling, or with thinking, is a necessary result from 
these being the essential factors in all human activity. 
Which weighs most with any individual is a matter of 
temperament. We all have them all in some degree. 
For we must not think only of the ideals of perfect 
goodness of activity, of perfect truth, of perfect beauty, 
of which we have already spoken. Those are, indeed, 
ideals to but few, and they the noblest souls. If these 
alone could be called ideals, education would have 
nothing directly to say to them, for obviously the young 
are incapable of the highest possibilities of human life in 
any form. The ideals of the work~a-day world may be 
very small and even very low. They may refer toa very 
little piece of life, or they may set its whole tone and 
colour all its effects. Pursued for a long time an ideal 
purpose becomes habitual, and may even drive a man

IDEALS 431 
ot in the accustomed line after he has ceased to value 
itas an ideal at all. 
Without ideals, small and large, effort would lack 
most of its vitality. A boy, in whatever pursuit he is 
interested, has an ideal of excellence which he sets before 
himself and which sustains him through monotonous 
practice. The same boy when set to a task for which 
he does not care has quite another ideal—to get it done, 
not as well but as guickly as possible. In the former case 
the ideal refers to the object the activity is to accomplish ; 
in the latter case the accomplishment has no ideal value. 
Soitis throughout life. Good work always results from 
au attempt to realize an ideal. Remove that spur and 
the product deteriorates. Decrease the responsibility of 
the workman for the outcome of his labours and such a 
lowering of idealism necessarily follows. The pride of 
the workman in his work is the most valuable asset not 
only of him who enjoys the product but of the work- 
man himself. In its absence work becomes drudgery, 
for it is brightened by none of the triumphant joy of 
weing one’s own thoughts taking shape in one’s hands. 
There is much in the modern conditions of industry, 
‘pecially manufacturing industry, which necessarily 
tends to this degradation of work. This makes it all 
the more desirable that the young should be enabled to 
feel in all possible ways in their school exercises and 
scons the ideal of worthy performance, and that other 
| ideals should be assiduously cultivated to fill as far as 
may be the empty place in after-life. 
Good product may be called the ideal of morality in 
work. With an extension of the application of ‘pro- 
duct? it may further be said to be the ideal of all conduct. 
| The primary spring of good work is the instinct of 
1 a
-P-A-G-E-451
432 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
constructiveness, and the root of all conduct which affects 
others is found in the personal instincts, especially those 
of altruism and of self-respect. As intelligence de- 
velops the relations of self to others become clearer, so 
that they are no longer approved or disapproved by the 
gratification or dissatisfaction they produce in ourselves, 
The rights of self are transferred by analogy and sym- 
pathy to others, and hence arises an ideal of justice. Of 
course such a development could not take place out of 
society. As in all other forms of spiritual growth the 
opinions and the actions of those around us guide our 
modes of thinking, feeling, and willing. 
The ideal is at first involved in the actual events to 
which it is applied. The boy judges such an act just, 
and such another unjust, without having a formula 
expressive of the nature of justice ready to produce on 
demand. With many people such moral ideals remain in 
this intuitive stage throughout life. Especially, as we 
have seen, is this so with women, who, it has been well 
said, “are moralists, from the best to the worst of 
them.”? But they do not, as a rule, express their 
morality in abstract propositions, nor judge actions by the 
extent of their coincidence with such axioms. Rather 
they base their judgements on their impression of the 
suitability of each act as a whole to the circumstances 
which called it forth. 
The first step in the disentanglement of such an ideal 
as that of justice is its personification in a typical hero. 
Such embodiment is a characteristic of early adolescence, 
especially among boys. Later the ideal becomes more 
detached, and at least reaches the stage of current moral 
principles. The final step to critical thought exercised 
1 Anthony Hope: The Intrusions of Peggy, ch. 1.
-P-A-G-E-452
IDEALS 433 
on such principles is taken but by few; indeed, only few 
ae sufficiently endowed to take it effectively or profit- 
ably. An attempt to secure a premature detachment of 
principles from concrete conduct leads of necessity to 
unteality, or to that ethical precocity we know—and 
dislike—as priggishness. 
It will be seen from what has been said that the ideals 
sought at any time are in the realms of interests. 
Interests develop out of instincts, purposes are related 
tointerests, and ideals to purposes, so that the springs of 
life are gathered into one continuous stream. 
The religious ideal is both more personal and higher 
than any social ideal of the relation of man to man. 
Many writers speak of a religious instinct, but that 
seems a loose use of the term. Though the religious 
feeling i is universal among the races of mankind, yet it 
8a compound in which the instincts of fear, love, and 
elf are associated. The form which the religious ideal 
takes is, of course, determined for a child by the religion 
of those around him, especially by his home and his 
turch. It is at first purely personal—either a loving 
Father or a harsh taskmaster according to the religious 
atmosphere in which the child lives and the teaching on 
rligion which he receives. Later, it expands into a 
"cognition of the brotherhood of others in that Father’s 
family. As intelligence develops the ideal representa- 
tion of the Godhead becomes more and more spiritual. 
At adolescence personal religious feelings are often 
Stirred, but except in cases more or less abnormal, there 
ems no evidence that religious unrest and disbelief are 
common among those whose religion has from the first 
een associated with the corporate: life of a religious 
body, and not made a purely personal matter.

434 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
The school into which religion enters does more bya 
spirit of reverence, by common worship, by the unosten- 
tatious religion of the teachers, than by set lessons; to 
cultivate a religious attitude of mind. Not that exposi- 
‘tions of belief adapted to the pupils’ understandings are 
not needed to give form to the ideal conceptions. Un- 
happily, ‘religious instruction’ is too often only an 
euphemism for the geography and history of Palestine, 
which in themselves have no special spiritual significance. 
When we turn to ideals primarily intellectual we find 
two main classes—the practical and the theoretical. 
The former show their presence and power in life by 
their reference to use. From the simple contrivances of 
the child to the invention of the most delicate, or the 
most powerful, machinery, or of the most elaborate 
instruments for aiding advance in science, each is the 
realization in appropriate material of an ideal plan adapted 
to an ideally conceived end. For such inventions the 
mind must not only be stored with all pertinent know- 
ledge but must have a particular bent. Perhaps in n0 
realm of activity can the natural differences between men 
be more clearly seen. We all make our little inventions 
in daily life, but those who first imagine, then produce— 
it may be in many successive stages, each more perfect 
than the last—instruments that change profoundly the 
conditions of men’s lives or knowledge are few. No 
where can we better learn the lesson that ideals cannot 
be taught. Material, and, it may be, inspiration and 
encouragement, may be given, but the inventive mind 
can only work when free and untrammelled. Again 
the course of the school is obvious. In all constructive 
work it should leave as free a hand as possible in the 
planning; should welcome originality, even if it spoil
-P-A-G-E-454
IDEALS 435 
material ; and should give to those who show that they 
an imagine new constructions genetous opportunity to 
cary out their practical ideals. 
The theoretical ideal of the intellect is the attainment 
of absolute truth. This also we can and should all feel 
inso far as the truth relates to our concerns. Again it is 
pain that the imagination will act only in the domain of 
interest. Whatever branch of knowledge be a ‘subject 
of interest, in that matter the ‘ideal of truth will most 
sek to find realization. This love of truth for its own 
ske is the fine flower which springs from the toot of 
tuiosity. Its growth is of necessity gradual. First, 
it shows as a regard for exactness of statement, then 
wa thirst for explanation, in which possible reasons 
for what is experienced are imagined. This slowly but 
continuously widens till it may try to embrace the 
wiverse in one ideal systematic whole. 
“God’s gift was that man should conceive of truth 
And yearn to gain it, catching at mistake, 
As midway help till he reach fact indeed. 
The statuary ere he mould a shape 
Boasts a like gift, the shape’s idea, and next 
The aspiration to produce the same; 
So, taking clay, he calls his shape thereout, 
Cries ever ‘Now I have the thing I see’: 
Yet all the while goes changing what was wrought, 
From falsehood like the truth, to truth itself.”? 
Always the knowledge is desired for its own sake, as 
We say, That is, explanation is sought without any 
tecessary reference to whether or not it will be useful to 
Win any other way than in increasing our knowledge 
‘ad understanding of things. 
1 Browning: 4 Death in the Desert.
-P-A-G-E-455
436 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
Doubtless, the theoretical and practical ideals of truth 
may be conjoined in any one case, or generally in any 
one person. Then each is of medium strength. When 
either is very strong it dominates the mind. Then we 
may say that one or the other is supreme, because the 
mind is of practical temperament yet well endowed with 
intelligence, or of intellectual temperament with little 
proclivity towards the actual and practical. 
The dominance of an intellectual ideal in life is neces- 
sarily marked by calmness. Yet feeling is by no means 
absent. There is both the joy of search and the joy of 
accomplishment, or, it may be, the sorrow of failure. | 
Of the two joys that of search is the immediate effulgence 
of the ideal, When accomplishment is reached the ideal 
has been realized and inspires to no further effort. Yet 
out of it may grow another ideal prompting to fresh 
striving. Every one who has intellectual ideals feels the 
force of Lessing’s saying : ‘‘If I were offered the choice 
between already ascertained truth and the pleasure of 
finding it out, I would choose the second.” 
It is the severely practical person, whose ideal is to get 
something done, and to whom knowledge is of value 
exactly to the degree to which it helps towards this, who 
prefers his knowledge ready-made. Such narrow utili- 
tarian minds are very rare indeed, if not quite unknown, 
among children. True, some have marked leanings that 
way, and feel much more strongly the value of know- 
ledge which can be put to material use than of that which 
can only be made available in attaining more knowledge. 
But they have curiosity too, and it is not difficult to keep 
that instinct alive independently, so that knowledge is 
sought both when it bears on every-day pursuits and 
when it only enlarges the sweep of fancy. Unhappily
-P-A-G-E-456
IDEALS 437 
the assumption that the amount of information gained is 
the chief test of school work has obscured the truth that a 
nete giving of information not only fails to stimulate 
the intellect to frame ideals for itself but actually 
arophies that power by giving no opportunity for its 
wercise. Certainly information is the necessary material 
with which imagination works. But unless the power 
w form ideals be exercised in youth it will be likely to 
sow itself but a weakly cripple in maturity. 
The word ‘ideal’ is probably more often applied to 
the various aspirations of art than to those of thought 
| which we have just considered. In them, too, it has 
become proverbial that the true artist must be born. He 
weds to be trained to acquire the mechanism through 
which his art works, but the power of imagining the 
bauty he represents can in no way be given him. This, 
indeed, is the case not only in art but in all imaginative 
constructions. Each mind makes its own ideals, and 
most truly do they reflect its character. ~The difference 
isin degree, not in kind ; but that difference sets the real 
atists of the world in a class apart. 
The origin of all art is in the innate tendency to play. 
ltis, indeed, the play of the intellect making construc- 
tions for no ulterior purpose but simply for the joy 
fiven by their mere existence. ‘Supreme art,” said 
Schiller, “‘is that in which play reaches its highest point, 
when we play, so to speak, from the depths of our 
bing, » 
All ideals are in a sense creative, for all inspire activity 
to do something which the doer has not done before. 
By creative art, however, we mean the setting forth of 
‘mething new to the world. In the same way we speak 
ofa new discovery or invention or a new theory of life
-P-A-G-E-457
438 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
as “‘ original”. These are all realizations of the ideals of 
the few. Those of the many are more modest. They 
lead to enrichment of the experience of the individual, 
not necessarily or usually of that of the world. The 
intellectual ideal of the many is simply to understand 
clearly what has already been added to the knowledge 
of the world ; the moral ideal is to live a life which con- 
forms to rules of conduct generally accepted. So in art 
the ideal of the many can only be to appreciate with some 
fullness the creations of others. It should be noted that 
this is a real ideal: it imagines an attitude of mind and 
a power of insight and feeling not yet possessed ; it holds 
this vision to be worthy of attainment, and so it forms the 
purpose of endeavouring to get as near its realization as 
possible. Truly it is a lower ideal than that of the 
creative artist, but it is the only one possible to ordinary 
minds, and without it art is altogether banished from 
many lives. 
Such appreciation is often made truer and keener by 
cultivation of a power of imitative production, and to 
this, most can attain in some modest degree. Indeed, 
in literature the vast majority of people do take the first 
steps, though many stop very near the starting-point. 
Fewer learn to produce with brush and pencil copies 
even of simple pictures and of natural objects. Yet 
those who have learned either to represent a spray of 
flowers with the brush, or to express a body of ideas 
clearly and forcibly with the pen, have done something 
of no little importance in improving their power of 
appreciation of painting or of literature. 
Everyone will agree that ideals of conduct and thought 
concern the school. They belong to the serious business 
of life, whether that business be to earn a livelihood of
-P-A-G-E-458
IDEALS 439 
simply to live as a worthy human being. According to 
the favourite doctrine of the Gradgrinds who are still 
with us, that is sufficient for the school. On the other 
land, Aristotle—whom it is, perchance, permissible to 
hold wiser than any Gradgrind of them all—insisted on 
the Greek view that-we should “‘ choose business for the 
sike of leisure, what is useful and necessary for the sake of 
what is fine.” Both business and leisure are necessary in 
life, “ but leisure is more worth having and more of an end 
than business, so we must find out how we are to employ 
our leisure. Not, surely, in playing games; for that 
would imply that amusement is the end of life... It 
isclear, then, that there are subjects which ought to form 
part of education solely with a view to the right employ- 
ment of leisure, and that this education and those studies 
exist for their own sake, while those that have business in 
view are studied as being necessary and for the sake of 
something else?! These subjects form the domain of 
the muses, summed up by the Greeks in the generic term 
‘Music?, 
We may justify their inclusion in our modern schools 
even more surely than could Aristotle in the schools of 
Athens. For it is allowable, if not always judicious, to 
omit from school elements which are abundantly fur- 
tished by life ; it is not sufferable that those of which 
life is otherwise destitute should be excluded. Art in 
al its forms pervaded ancient Athens; no one could 
escape its influence. It is not nearly so prominent in 
modern life. This reacts on the school, and accentuates 
its inherent tendency to be matter-of-fact and even 
commonplace in outlook. 
The school, however, must direct its efforts essentially 
1 Poktics (Burnet’s Translation) vii, 14 ; viii, 3.
-P-A-G-E-459
440 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
to the training of appreciation. It cannot cater for the 
possible immortal poet or painter or sculptor among its 
scholars. It could not help him if it found him ; though, 
indeed, it might lessen the spontaneity of his utterance. 
For him, as for others, it could only directly teach the 
alphabet of the process of expression. 
We have already seen that power of imitative pro- 
duction develops power of appreciation. Happily, 
schools are more and more giving their scholars oppor- 
tunity to copy in water-colours simple natural objects, 
such as sprays of leaves and flowers. Fewer seem to 
encourage them to paint, from imagination playing on 
past experience, ideal sprays. Sometimes, of course, a 
child can only reproduce baldly and schematically ; but 
often a pretty fancy is displayed. Criticism of such 
efforts should be the child’s own, and should first correct 
anything which is essentially false to nature, and secondly 
deal with the general grouping and effect of the whole. 
In producing such a sketch the child uses past experience, 
but in no wise slavishly. A distinct set of flowers 
formerly seen does not start up in his mind, but he com- 
bines into an imagined whole, without conscious analysis, 
elements which are yet due to analysis. It need hardly 
be pointed out that minds which do not visualize can 
scarcely be expected to distinguish themselves in this. 
Original composition is always a case of ideal con- 
struction. Let the reader examine his own experience. 
There is a topic to be discussed and a desire to discuss it 
well and clearly. As this purpose is dominant in mind 
we find ideas connected with it coming into conscious- 
ness, we know not whence. Some we reject without 
consideration ; they are felt to be incompatible. Others 
we reject or modify after critical consideration. So at
-P-A-G-E-460
IDEALS 44t 
st the theme in outline stands in idea. Then comes 
the expression, which is really the artistic part of the 
whole. Words and phrases come readily enough, but 
without critical selection they are apt to be awkward, if 
not obscure. In time, no doubt, practice may make 
the art of expression nearly, if not quite, as automatic 
as the expert painter’s strokes with the brush. The 
beginner has to give care to both. 
Now, if school children be trained to aim at an artistic 
expression of their ideas whenever they write a com- 
position exercise, they will be learning in the surest 
possible way a little of what style means, when and why 
one style is good, another bad. Of course the style 
cultivated must be natural to the child. Some are 
matter-of-fact in everything. They state an event just 
as it happened, without comment or reflexions; they 
describe a thing as it is in its bald obvious qualities. 
Others are, as we say, more imaginative. They see 
likenesses and analogies; they personify things and 
forces, they reflect and comment, they love metaphors 
and similes. The difference is well illustrated in the 
productions of two girls, of fourteen and thirteen years 
of age respectively, recorded by M. Binet! To take 
one quite characteristic example. The girls were asked 
to write a short passage beginning “‘’ The star ”, 
The elder wrote ‘‘ The Pole Star is a part of the Little 
Bear”; the younger, “The star was shining and seemed 
to lead me; when I felt disheartened I looked up at it 
and once again pursued my lonely path.” 
Nothing could be more matter-of-fact than the former 
production. Probably an attempt to develop in such 
a mind appreciation for any literary qualities beyond 
1 Etude expérimentale de Fintelligence.  
-P-A-G-E-461
442 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
methodical clearness and precision would be hopeless, 
That then—perfect lucidity of arrangement and expres- 
sion—is the true ideal for such a child. 
But many children who write thus baldly are capable 
of better things. The school too often makes no 
attempt to cultivate style, and anything which soars 
above the ground is discouraged by the ridicule of 
scholars, and at times of teachers. If only this negative 
influence be removed, style often bursts out spon- 
taneously. Needless to say that with help and encourage- 
ment it becomes more common. And, surely, to use 
one’s mother-tongue effectively is no small gain. To 
illustrate my point I venture to reproduce a little essay 
written in the ordinary course of the work of a primary 
school by a boy of ten, which I know to have been his 
own production, entirely unaided and unprompted. It 
has its faults, and truly childish ones they are, and we 
can easily trace the source of his general idea and see 
the use of imitation made by originality. But it does 
show the germ of a true literary feeling, and is in every 
way superior to much similar work. 
A Winvy Day. 
“On, On, On, never ceasing in mortal’s eyes, I, Boreas, rushed, 
and.the people of the world said as they felt my breath, ‘Ugh, the 
north wind,’ and shivered as they muffled themselves up, But on] 
went whistling and howling among the trees of a mighty forest, 
tearing up young green saplings like straws, and hurling them 
defiantly at the mighty oak, who groaned in his branches like 2 
wounded man, Then I betook myself to the highway, and tossed 
the thatch off the wayside inn, for I feared no man. Suddenly when 
I was off my guard, the south wind, my eternal enemy, appeared. A 
battle ensued, and the people of earth called it a hurricane, but 
spirits knew it to be a battle of the winds. 
I came off victor, and feeling mischievous, sped away to a distant

town to give vent to my feelings. When I arrived there a carnival 
was being held, and I whisked people’s hats all over the field. I spied 
atent at the farthest end of the field, and puckering up my lips I 
blew a blast which sent tent and all, hurry, scurry over an ice-cream 
«att headlong into a ditch, and I laughed long and merrily, for that 
was indeed a carnival to me, 
But I was growing tired now (for even Boreas grows tired) and 
my cousin the east wind wished to take a journey over the sun- 
scorched deserts of Arabia, so I returned to my home at the North 
Pole, 
Such early efforts are likely at times to show exaggera- 
tion, straining after effect, incongruity of style and 
matter, and, of course, inequality in execution. It 
should be remembered, however, that the children who 
naturally write in this style are the sensitives, that they 
are easily discouraged and their self-respect readily 
wounded. After all, they are only trying their wings. 
We do not ridicule or discourage exuberance of move- 
ment when a child is learning to ride a bicycle ; we know 
that this—like youth—is a fault time will cure. Surely 
the same sympathetic attitude should be taken in the 
matter of composition. Kindly suggestion when meta- 
phor or treatment is out of keeping with the subject will 
be welcomed, but mere exuberances of style may be left 
to cure themselves, unless, indeed, they show a tendency 
to develop into artificiality. Above all, it should be 
borne in mind that what seems redundant ornament to 
One appears apt and charming to another. The teacher 
of matter-of-fact practical temperament should be especi- 
ally suspicious of his judgements on imaginative literary 
productions of his pupils. 
This leads us, indeed, to a very real difficulty in all 
exercise of influence on children’s appreciation. Taste 
must be the spontaneous outcome of the soul or it is a
-P-A-G-E-463
444 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
mere sham. It would be impossible to say how much 
of the general taste of any period is mere following of 
fashion. And fashion itself is often the outcome of 
certain intellectual ideas rather than of artistic feeling. 
This is admirably put in an article in The Times:! 
“Weed is only a bad name we give to a plant when we 
do not want it. If there were no gardens there would 
be no weeds. In fact, it is the law that makes so hand- 
some a plant as the dandelion a sinner, the law that 
dandelions are wild flowers and have no right in the 
garden. A dandelion in a flower border looks positively 
ugly to a gardener, and the sight of it makes his fingers 
itch to pull it up. He has his idea, a purely conventional 
idea, of what flowers ought to be in a border; and this 
idea is so strong that it even controls his sense of sight, 
making him see ugliness where there is beauty, just 
because that beauty is not part of his own design. 
“This fact about the dandelion might be turned into 
a fable for art critics, to warn them that their taste and 
_ the taste of their time is not absolute, that their sense 
of beauty is likely to be affected by circumstances to an 
extent which they cannot realize. There was a time, 
and not so long ago, when Gothic buildings were 
regarded by the man of culture much as dandelions are 
regarded by the gardener. The very name Gothic, like 
weed, was a term of reproach, and it explains why Gothic 
buildings were thought ugly. They were supposed to 
be the work of a barbarous age, which, because it was 
barbarous, could do nothing good ; and every character- 
istic of the Gothic was regarded as a mark of barbarism. 
It was an argument in a circle no doubt, but such argu- 
ments seem most convincing when once a prejudice is 
1 March 28, 1910.
-P-A-G-E-464
IDEALS 445 
thoroughly established. First the eye is influenced by 
the mind, and then the mind reasons from what the eye, 
thus influenced. by it, reveals to it. 
“The contempt of Gothic is only one instance out 
of many of the same kind of prejudice. It acted in the 
other direction in the case of Graeco-Roman art. That 
was supposed to be the product of a great age of civiliza- 
tion, and was therefore assumed to be beautiful. In- 
deed, the Graeco-Roman sculptors were held to have been 
masters of an absolute canon of beauty. The Venus de 
Medici was an ideal, and so was the Apollo Belvedere. 
In so far as any sculpture departed from this ideal, it 
was ugly and barbarous; and the best the modern artist 
could do was to imitate these masterpieces as closely 
as possible. Hence Canova and the classical pictures 
of David and innumerable other works of art, which 
now seem about as interesting as illustrations to the 
classical dictionary.” 
Canons of taste which find acceptance in one age are 
rejected in another. Is it, then, to be held that after all 
there is no real difference between good and bad art ; 
that beautiful and ugly are words whose real meaning 
is prejudice? Such scepticism would strike its roots far, 
and would contradict the constant faith of mankind. 
The lesson rather is that taste cannot be directly taught. 
Such teaching makes us see things through a more or 
less powerful disturbing medium, brings in 
“ The instinctive theorizing whence a fact 
Looks to the eye as the eye likes the look.” ? 
It is not from ideas but from things that taste must 
spring ; for it is things that are beautiful or ugly while 
1 Browning : The Ring and the Book, i, 863-4.
-P-A-G-E-465
446 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
ideas may spring from any source, and have no necessary 
connexion with aesthetic principles. As The Times says 
in concluding the article from which I have quoted: “In 
fact, the sense of beauty seems untrustworthy because it 
is seldom trusted. We talk of bad taste when we mean 
no taste. If we could analyse all the ugliness of att, 
we should find probably that it was the result, not of a 
perverted sense of beauty, but of ideas interfering with 
the sense of beauty; and that the pleasure it gives is 
not aesthetic at all. The difficulty is, not to take pleasure 
in the right things, but to take the right kind of pleasure 
in them. If only we could judge our feelings about 
works of art instead of judging the works of art them- 
selves, we should be much less liable to error.” 
‘Taste is often communicated by contagion of enthusi- 
asm ; never by didactic directions to note the beauty of 
this or of that. Nor is it well to ask for expressions 
of taste. If they come spontaneously, well and good. 
But to demand them is a sure way to cultivate that 
insincerity which leads many men and women to talk 
of art less to express appreciation than to conceal its 
absence. The scholastic mania for putting everything 
into words has strangled many a promising ideal at its 
birth. 
It is, however, quite essential that the material pro- 
vided should be so graduated that each psychological 
age has put before it literature in which it can appreciate 
both the ideas and the form. Art differs from nature, 
real literature from mere narrative or description, in that 
it presents to us not merely facts, but the facts interpreted 
by the imagination of the artist. The true artist-soul 
sees deeply into the inner meaning of things, and detects 
likenesses and relations which the common mind cannot |

see unaided, which the prosaic mind often cannot see at 
all. These last are they who dismiss all poetry as “silly 
suff.” Probably they are the victims of a ‘practical 
education? as well as the possessors of minds originally 
commonplace. To advance in power of appreciating 
literature, especially poetic literature, is to gain increased 
insight into such analogies. This is possible only if the 
amount and kind of insight demanded at any time be 
such as is spontaneously active. 
In all ordinary minds the similarities recognized are 
first those of sense, later those of emotional tone. We 
may see the progress writ large in the development of 
poetry. The imagery of the earliest poets is simple and 
somewhat infrequent ; its appeal to sense is direct. On 
the other hand, the most characteristic and the most 
valued modern poetry makes its appeal to the deeper 
spiritual life, and evokes emotional response by its power 
of filling the soul with living images, all adapted to 
deepen and strengthen that tone. Compare, for instance, 
the simple and direct imagery of Homer—his “Zeus 
the cloud-gatherer”, ‘‘the silver eddies of Teneios”, 
“the stream which floweth on over him like unto oil »— 
with such poetry as 
“All he had loved, and moulded into thought, 
From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet sound, 
Lamented Adonais. Morning sought 
Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound, 
Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground, 
Dimmed the aerial eyes that kindle day ; 
Afar the melancholy thunder moaned, 
Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay, 
And the wild winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay.” ! 
Shelley: Adonais, xiv.
-P-A-G-E-467
448 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
A like development may be traced in poetical form, 
In early English poetry such a mechanical similarity as 
alliteration played an important part. The lines ran in 
couples, and usually two chief words in the first line, and 
one in the second began with the same consonants, as 
“wudu wyrtum fest 
water oferhelmath.”?! 
Some eight centuries later the same form was still 
retained. In Piers Plowman the alliterative rule is very 
generally followed— 
“There preched a Pardonere 
As he a prest were, 
Broughte forth a bulle 
With bishopes seles.” 2 
Though alliteration is still used with considerable 
effect it is no longer subject to definite rules of occur- 
rence. Tennyson often employs it happily, as in 
“The splendour falls on castle walls 
And snowy summits old in story: 
The long light shakes across the lakes 
And the wild cataract leaps in glory.” 
The formal recurrence of the same consonantal sound 
which marked old verse seems to us artificial, just because 
we demand that the effect of alliteration shall be to make 
the verse harmonize subtly with the ‘feeling? of the 
passage. In the example just given, for instance, the 
consonance of the alliterative effect with the general 
atmosphere of repose is perfect.

Now-a-days, we should find nothing to please our 
taste in efforts of perverted ingenuity which in former 
ages won admiration. We read of a Latin poem of 
some hundred hexameters in which every word began 
with P, and of another set of verses in which C was the 
only initial letter—a compliment to Charles the Bold 
to whom they were addressed. Among other recorded 
examples was an Iliad, from each successive book of 
which a corresponding letter of the Greek alphabet was 
omitted. ‘‘The same species of laborious trifling by 
the report of the traveller Chardin, appears to have pre- 
vailed in Persia. One of the poets of that country had 
the honour of reading to his sovereign a poem, in which 
no admission had been allowed to the letter A. The 
king, who was tired of listening, and whose weariness 
had probably too good a cause, returned the poet thanks, 
and expressed his very great approbation of his omission 
of the letter A ; but added, that in his opinion, the poem 
might, perhaps, have been better still, if he had only 
taken the trouble to omit, at the same time, all the other 
letters of the alphabet. ! 
Rhyme in modern verse corresponds broadly in its 
effect to alliteration, for it also appeals to audible con- 
sonance. Like alliteration, rhyme may become weari- 
some if continued through a long poem. In each case 
the mechanism of the verse is too insistent for modern 
tars. Doubtless also it is often a bondage to the poet 
himself, though not many are as frank as was Butler in 
lamenting it— 
“But those that write in rhyme, still make

For one for sense, and one for rhyme, 
I think’s sufficient at one time.”?} 
But that even the greatest poets at times feel themselves 
cramped is evident by such bad rhymes as that of 
Milton— 
“That we on Earth with undiscording voice 
May rightly answer that melodious noise.” ? 
In rhyme, as in alliteration, literature supplies some 
curious specimens of ingenuity, as, for example, George 
Herbert’s short poem Paradise which consists of five 
three-lined rhyming stanzas, in each of which the word 
ending the first line is shortened by omitting its initial 
letter to give the ending of the second line, and the same 
process is repeated for the third time. For instance, the 
second stanza reads— 
“What open force, or hidden charm 
Can blast my fruit, or bring me harm 
While the inclosure is thine arm?” 
The essential elements in poetic form are, however, 
neither alliteration nor rhyme, but metre and rhythm. 
Here also fashion changes. Early English poetry with 
its metre determined by number of accents rather than 
value of syllables sounds uncouth to a modern eat, 
which is only satisfied with syllabic regularity as well as 
regularity of stress. 
Metre is analogous with ‘time? in music. In each 
case certain forms are congruous with some emotions, 
repugnant to others. If this be neglected neither true 
poetry nor true music results. Blank verse suits 
Paradise Lost, but it is impossible to imagine Shelley's 
1 Hudibras, Part ii. Canto i, 27-30. 2 At a Solemn Music, 17-18
-P-A-G-E-470
IDEALS 451 
Ode to a Skylark written in that form. Perhaps as good 
an example of incongruity as can easily be found among 
relly great writers is the metre in which Scott wrote 
Marmion. The form would suit a brief lyric, but in 
so long a poem as that to which it is here applied it 
becomes wearisome and trivial. 
In reading aloud or reciting, both rhythm and rhyme 
should be duly marked. ‘‘ Many reciters seem to be 
ignorant of the fact that rhythm, in all poetry that is worth 
reciting, is a means of expression ; indeed, that rhythm 
and sense are so closely connected that the one cannot be 
understood without the other. Spoil the rhythm and 
you spoil the sense; misunderstand the sense and you 
will mar the rhythm. In fact, good verse is said wrongly 
if it is not said rhythmically ; and any dramatic airs and 
graces which break the rhythm, or even distract the 
hearer’s attention from it, are not merely superfluous but 
mischievous. A reciter of poetry ought no more to 
gesticulate than a violinist ought to wave his bow about 
in the middle of his performance. Music, in the one 
case, and words, in the other, are the only proper means 
of expression; and in good poetry there is even less 
occasion for displays of virtuosity than in good music. 
A reciter’s first aim should be to understand thoroughly 
the poem which he proposes to recite; not merely the 
sense of it, but also the quality of its emotion; for he 
cannot understand the one without understanding the 
other. And he cannot understand either unless he is 
awate of the expressive function of metre and rhythm. 
“We say metre and rhythm, because rhythm is neces- 
sary to preserve metre from mere sing-song. It is the 
peculiar character of each line, expressive of its peculiar 
sense and emotion, which is imposed upon the general
-P-A-G-E-471
452 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
pattern of the metre. A familiar instance is to be found 
in the line~ 
“Of man’s first disobedience and the fruit—” 
Here a reader who does not give careful attention to the 
sense will adhere to the strict metrical pattern, lay no 
stress on the word jirst, and spoil both the rhythm and 
the meaning of the verse. In all good poetry there are 
such delicate varieties of rhythm; and the reader or 
reciter, if he searches for these and uses them as means 
of expression, will find that there is no room in his art 
for dramatic effects. He must know how to manage his 
voice, of course, so that his audience may not be troubled 
by its defects. But when he can do that he has nothing 
to think about but the phrasing of his poetry, which 
should be musical rather than dramatic, and expressive 
as the phrasing of music is expressive. ... 
“The treatment of rhyme is one of the most difficult 
problems in the delivery of poetry. Reciters often say 
rhymed verse as if they were trying to conceal the fact 
that it isrhymed. But poets would scarcely use rhymes 
if they did not mean them to be heard; and it is said 
that many good poets, in reading their own poetry, ate 
apt to lay great stress on the rhymes, as on the rhythm. 
Certainly a reciter should not be afraid of rhymes. 
Where a rhyming word is important in sound or sense 
he should sound it boldly; and even when the sense 
runs over without a break into the next line he should 
not be too anxious to insist upon its continuity. For 
in poetry lines are facts that are not meant to be ignored. 
Indeed, rhymes are there to emphasize them. But the 
good poet usually shows, by the use of strong or weak 
rhymes, how far he means them to be stressed. In the
-P-A-G-E-472
IDEALS 453 
Ancient Mariner for instance, which is a model in 
all the formal excellences of poetry, it is quite clear that 
the rhymes are meant to be stressed in the verse— 
“The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, 
The furrow followed free ; 
We were the first that ever burst 
Into that silent sea.” 
For here the rhyme-words are both important in sense 
and strong in sound. On the other hand, the rhymes 
should be softly sounded in the verse— 
“Sometimes a-dropping from the sky 
I heard the skylark sing ; 
Sometimes all little birds that are, 
How they seem’d to fill the earth and air 
With their sweet jargoning !” 
For, apart from the weakness and imperfection of the 
thyme sounds, the rhythm would be spoilt by any 
emphasis on the last words of the lines. In fact, rhyme 
isa part of metre and, with metre, is always subject to 
thythm. Understand the rhythm of a poem and you 
will know how to treat its rhymes. The more expres- 
sive a poem is, the more it is swayed by rhythm; and 
the good reciter will allow his voice to be swayed by 
thythm as if he were thinking aloud and rhythm were 
the natural expression of his own thought.”} 
In all the formal elements of poetry the direct appeal 
is sensuous. In metaphor and simile the suggestion 
tests in emotional congruity or immediate apprehension 
of relations. Things of sense are made vehicles for 
things of spirit. The metaphor is spontaneous; it 
sptings from an immediate feeling or emotion; it is 
1 Article on The Reading of Poetry in The Times, Sept. rgth, 1910.
-P-A-G-E-473
454 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
essentially the outcome of passion. Hence the ease with 
which metaphors are mixed in an oratorical outburst, 
as when in a debate in the House of Commons a promi- 
nent politician accused the Government of desiring 
“to kill one Assembly by a blow, and to destroy the 
other Assembly by the slow poison of the guillotine.” 
The simile, on the other hand, is a deliberate comparison, 
often of some length. It is a vehicle of description 
intended to induce a quiet appreciation and so to bring 
out some special emotional value. While, then, the 
appeal of metaphor is directly emotional that of simile 
is primarily intellectual. By metaphor we are stirred, 
but on simile we love to dwell. 
To illustrate metaphor and simile adequately would 
be an endless task. Two metaphors that have always 
seemed to me very beautiful and expressive are in a 
Fragment on Music by Shelley. He invokes Music— 
“Silver key of the fountain of tears, 
Where the spirit drinks till the brain is wild; 
Softest grave of a thousand fears, 
Where their mother, Care, like a drowsy child, 
Is laid asleep in flowers,” 
The simile in the last two lines is equally satisfying. 
Of all the metaphors in Jn Memoriam none seems to 
me mote expressive than where Tennyson calls the 
“brief lays” which compose that poem 
“Short swallow-flights of song, that dip 
Their wings in tears, and skim away.”1 
Many boys and girls can feel the beauty and effect 
of such metaphors as these. The teacher must not

IDEALS 455 
attempt to interfere. The whole spiritual exaltation 
evaporates in talk. / 
Metaphors are also to be found in prose. Bacon made 
very frequent use both of them and of similes, often 
quaintly humorous. 
“A king . . . is the fountain of honour, which should not run 
with a waste pipe, lest the courtiers sell the water.” 1 
Far excelling this in elaboration are the metaphors of 
Lyly. His Euphues and his England ends with a long 
eulogy to Elizabeth in which, in one paragraph, we have: 
“This is that Caesar that first bound the Crocodile to the Palme 
tree, bridling those, that sought to raine hir: This is that good Pelican 
that to feede hir people spareth not to rend hir owne personne: This 
is that mightie Eagle, that hath throwne dust into the eyes of the 
Hart, that went about to worke destruction to hir subiectes, into 
whose winges although the blinde Beetle would haue crept, and so 
being carryed into hir nest, destroyed hir young ones, yet hath she 
with the vertue of hir fethers, consumed that flye in his owne fraud.” 
Such writing is as far removed from the true use of 
metaphor as it can very well be. It is as laboured, as 
strained, and as artificial, as the ingenious tricks with the 
alphabet already noticed. 
Of similes I will cite but a very few arranged roughly 
in order of appeal to successive stages of emotional 
development. 
“There is sweet music here that softer falls 
Than petals from blown roses on the grass, 
Or night-dews on still waters between walls 
Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass; 
Music that gentlier on the spirit lies, 
Than tir’d eyelids upon tir’d eyes”?

The pictures raised are simple and clear, and there is no 
appeal to deep or complex emotion. 
But little more difficult, though less immediate and 
intimate to experience, is Keats’ 
“Then felt I like some watcher of the skies 
When a new planet swims into his ken.”? 
Wordsworth’s 
“Thy soul was like a star, and dwelt apart: 
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea.”? 
demands a wider scope of imagination, and its force can 
only be felt by one who has heard much of Milton’s 
poetry well read. The comparison in the first line, 
moreover, has only one of its terms in the realm of sense. 
Shakespeare’s 
“T have ventured, 
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders, 
This many summers in a sea of glory, 
But far beyond my depth.” 
is picturesque, and the simile comes straight home to 
personal experience. But its full force is only felt after 
some experience of wide ambition which o?erleaps itself, 
and that children can have but in a small degree. 
Landor’s beautiful simile 
“The noble mansion is most distinguished by the beautiful images 
it retains of beings passed away ; and so is the noble mind.” 4 
is simple but appeals directly and forcibly only to those 
who have lost some who were dear to them. The

appreciation of boy or girl is, therefore, likely to be 
purely intellectual. 
The following somewhat laboured simile will probably 
appeal to teachers rather than to their pupils: 
“As sickly plants betray a niggard earth, 
Whose barren bosom starves her generous birth, 
Nor genial warmth, nor genial juice retains, 
Their roots to feed, and fill their verdant veins : 
And as in climes, where winter holds his reign, 
The soil, though fertile, will not teem in vain, 
Forbids her gems to swell, her shades to rise, 
Nor trusts her blossoms to the churlish skies : 
So draw mankind in vain the vital airs, 
Unform’d, unfriended, by those kindly cares, 
That health and vigour to the soul impart, 
Spread the young thought, and warm the opening heart: 
So fond instruction on the growing powers 
Of nature idly lavishes her stores, 
If equal justice with unclouded face 
Smile not indulgent on the rising race, 
And scatter with a free, though frugal hand, 
Light golden showers of plenty o’er the land: 
But tyranny has fix’d her empire there, 
To check their tender hopes with chilling fear, 
And blast the blooming promise of the year.”? 
The last example I shall give, exquisite as it is, I 
should not expect many young people to enter into very 
fully. Yet I would encourage all who were caught by 
the beauty of the words to commit it to memory. Years 
will give it a meaning, and such a verbal gem deserves 
to be treasured. It is Shelley’s 
“Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass, 
Stains the white radiance of Eternity, 
Until Death tramples it to fragments.” ?

458 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
The educational point is this. Power of appreciation 
will grow if suitable material be given and judiciously 
used, not as a text on which to examine, but as an 
influence which works mainly in the dark. Of course, 
as the apprehension of relations in a simile is intellectual, 
to that extent help may be given by suggestion or even 
by direct explanation. The error is to dwell on this, and 
so hinder the aesthetic and emotional effect to which 
intellectual grasp is only the hand-maiden. 
Before leaving the subject of literature a few words 
may be said on the use of contrast in making a point 
clear and vivid. Pithy epigrams are fixed in the mind by 
their sharp angles of expression as we may, perhaps, 
call them. Take for example Rochefoucault’s 
“Passion often makes a fool of a man of sense : sometimes it makes 
a man of sense of a fool.”} 
Like every other marked peculiarity of style antithesis 
becomes wearisome if frequently used in continuous 
writing. The mind is made continually to hop and 
skip instead of quietly plodding along. Moreover 
constant contrast of phrases soon loses its effect, and so 
the one justification for its use vanishes. Macaulay’s 
prose is certainly open to the criticism of being too 
antithetical. 
The subject of artistic and literary appreciation leads 
us naturally to say a few words on humour. It isa 
perilously small step from the sublime to the ridiculous, 
and that step is not at the same point for all minds. 
Especially is it placed differently for a child and for a 
cultured adult. Art grows out of play ; so the younger 
the child the more his sense of humour is limited to 
1 Maxim 327.
-P-A-G-E-478
IDEALS 459 
practical jokes. The next stage is when it embraces 
verbal descriptions of such events. The first sign of 
humour with a really literary basis is often the enjoyment 
of puns, and they are only a kind of practical joking 
with words. Nevertheless, the power to see a pun is 
asign that lanouage is beginning to attract attention by 
itself and apart from the meaning it conveys. Young 
children cannot see puns because their minds are wholly 
occupied by the general meaning. The same holds true 
of many worthy, but rather dull and prosaic, adults. On 
the other hand, a constant indulgence in punning— 
especially when youth has been left behind—indicates a 
frivolous cast of mind. Nevertheless, puns are at times 
effective, particularly as a form of gentle ridicule. I 
cannot refrain from quoting a happy instance of this, 
related of the late J. K. Stephen: 
“On a certain occasion a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, 
had been discoursing to an Essay Society on various theories of 
immortality, and had concluded a desultory speech by a quotation 
ftom Wordsworth’s famous poem. No sooner had he uttered the 
line ‘Heaven lies about us in our infancy’ than J. K. S. broke in 
with, ‘Perfectly true, D.; but that’s no reason why you should lie 
about Heaven when you're grown up.’”} 
Doubtless there are children who early see humour in 
many situations which involve no practical joking, and 
soon after get some appreciation of humour in expres- 
sion. But this is exceptional before adolescence. Quite 
commonly the humour of Pickwick fails to appeal to 
children in later boyhood and girlhood. 
Many things, however, excite the laughter of a child. 
The most general condition of the ludicrous seems to 
be the unexpected introduction of an incongruous 
Article in Tie Daily News, Feb, 11, 1901.
-P-A-G-E-479
460 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
element of relatively small importance. For instance, if 
a fierce dog rushed on to a stage during a comedy, sprang 
at the throat of the leading actor and severely injured 
him, it would be quite incongruous with the spirit of 
the scene, but it would by no means be ludicrous. If 
one began laughing, in the belief that the dog’s attack was 
feigned and was part of the fun, he would change his 
attitude immediately he grasped the true situation. But 
if a small terrier ran on to the stage during one of the 
ghost scenes in Hamlet, and began yelping at the ghost, 
most people would find it ludicrous. 
It takes but a very trivial occurrence of this kind 
to move children to laughter, and not much more to 
excite the risibility of adults. This presents a certain 
element of danger in trying to arouse literary apprecia- 
tion in children. For too often, if the desired feeling 
be not stirred, the inclination to laughter is aroused, 
though decorum may induce its suppression. I have 
known a teacher excite a class of boys of about fourteen 
to laughter by a really effective reading of a poem, simply 
because he was a stranger and, therefore, not bound to 
them by bonds of sympathy, and because at that critical 
age they were inclined to look upon all unaccustomed 
expression of emotion with contempt. Obviously, such 
a result hinders the growth of literary appreciation. 
A good parody is an excellent instance of humorous 
incongruity. With adolescents, such efforts may be 
effectively used to aid in the formation of a critical taste 
if they be not introduced too frequently. A parody 
ridicules the weaknesses of the author on whose works 
it is based, but does so indirectly. A judicious use of 
parodies, therefore, cultivates a habit of reflective com- 
parison, and militates against the indiscriminate enthusi-  
-P-A-G-E-480
IDEALS 5 46t 
asm which, by holding to be good all that is written by 
aconfessedly great author, makes real discriminative 
taste practically impossible. Take, for instance, the 
following extract from a parody of Marmion. Of this 
Scott himself is reported to have said to one of the two 
authors ‘‘T certainly must have written this myself, 
although I forget upon what occasion!” 
“Still o’er his head, while Fate he braved, 
His whizzing water-pipe he waved ; 
‘Whitford and Mitford, ply your pumps, 
You, Clutterbuck, come, stir your stumps, 
Why are you in such doleful dumps? 
A fireman, and afraid of bumps !— 
What are they fear’d on? fools! ’od rot ’em! 
Were the last words of Higginbottom.” + 
How happily, too, is the mirror held up to “ the other 
Wordsworth” in the same famous set of parodies— 
“Aunt Hannah heard the window break, 
And cried, ‘O naughty Nancy Lake, 
Thus to distress your aunt: 
No Drury Lane for you to-day!’ 
And while papa said, ‘Pooh, she may !? 
Mamma said, ‘No, she sha’n’t !” 
Well, after many a sad reproach, 
They got into a hackney coach, 
And trotted down the street, 
I saw them go: one horse was blind, 
The tails of both hung down behind, 
Their shoes were on their feet.”?

scious in so much of Wordsworth’s ostentatiously simple

verse, is made conscious, and the real poetic worth of 
such writing becomes manifest. 
Ideals, then, appear very early in life. At first they 
are aspirations to acquire the power to do things which 
others are seen to do. Then, as emulation and critical 
power grow, they become more and more detached from 
actual models. In other words, the individual begins 
to be self-directing—to set before himself things he 
would like to do and to be. Without a luxuriant growth 
of ideals in the soul the life is thin and starved. The 
school cannot plant them, but it can secure that the soil 
is well prepared so that when a seed of inspiration falls, 
it matters not whence, the plant may spring up and bear 
fruit an hundred-fold. At the same time a kindly watch- 
fulness is needed to uproot and destroy, if it be possible, 
evil aspirations. But it is the positive culture that is 
all important, and that demands both insight and tact. 
Action towards ideals is the one unchanging condition 
of a fruitful life. For such action the school should 
provide opportunity and give encouragement in all the 
great spheres of life. So only may its pupils escape the 
unavailing regrets of age, when 
“Suns rise and set and rise, and all is nought, 
The coast of boyhood farther still recedes, 
Age can but marvel why no dreams were brought

CHAPTER XIII 
CHARACTER 
Tuar it should train character is one of the very few 
general statements about education which meet with 
universal assent. I am not sure, however, that it is 
more than one of those platitudes, the oracular enuncia- 
tion of which is, according to Mr. Birrell, “the best 
way of introducing any subject” because ‘‘ they arouse 
attention, without exhausting it, and afford the pleasant 
sensation of thinking, without any of the trouble of 
thought.” For, when some examination is given as to 
what is meant by ‘character? one finds much want of pre- 
tision and much lack of agreement. From the same want 
of clearness of conception it comes to pass that but seldom 
does either home or school make any systematic attempt 
to train towards a definite ideal of character. It results 
that what training is given is not only desultory but 
incoherent, dependent on considerations of the moment 
tather than on fixed principles. 
All discussion of what makes a character morally good 
or bad belongs to ethics. The function of psychology 
is limited to enquiry into the constituents of character 
and their relation to each other, and into the part character 
plays in life. This is, nevertheless, a necessary pre- 
liminary to any practical attempt to influence character.

464 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
An educator must know its nature or he cannot deal with 
it effectively. To desire to train to goodness, and even 
to have a clear idea of how goodness is to be shown in 
act, are in no sense sufficient. Desire here, as elsewhere, 
is a blind and blundering guide unless intelligence trace 
the way. And the way lies through the child’s character, 
in which also is to be found the true end. For only in 
so far as action expresses character does good outward 
conduct show that this end has been reached. 
We will, then, first try to get a working idea of what 
should be included in character, and then ask how far 
that idea applies to the young. Here, as elsewhere, | 
wish to avoid all unusua' or technical use of terms. Let 
us, therefore, approach our analysis from the side of 
common speech, and take as our guide typical current 
expressions about character. 
In the first place we are forced to the position that 
character is not necessarily connected with goodness, a3 
is implied in the educational commonplace with which 
this chapter begins. We accept as rational and con- 
sistent such statements as that ‘X is a notoriously bad 
character’, ‘Robespierre had a character terrible in its 
inflexibility’, ‘The character of Tiberius has attracted 
general execration?; and Keightley wrote ‘thorough 
selfishness formed the basis of Henry’s charactet.”? 
Similarly, we speak of the ‘characters? of a play, and 
include under the term both the good and the bad. This 
comprehensive use of the word will cause no surprise 
when it is remembered that the distinction between good 
and bad is ethical, while the matter named is psycho- 
logical, and that psychology has no moral categories. 
Let us now examine some further expressions. We

-P-A-G-E-484
CHARACTER 465 
may fairly speak of a noble character or of an ignoble 
character ; a spiritual character or a mundane character. 
Washington Irving wrote of ‘“‘the softness and 
effeminacy which characterize the man of rank in most 
countries,” and we may say that the Romans of the 
early Republic were men of hard and warlike character. 
Such expressions imply a particular general attitude to 
people and things, a certain emotional evaluation of 
experiences, definite aspirations and wide-reaching pur- 
poses. Our judgement of the goodness or badness of 
characters largely depends on the nature of such ideals 
of life and conduct as are embodied in them. 
In the next place ‘character? seems always to include 
some reference to the extent of the intellectual outlook, 
as well as to the nature of the purposes and aspirations. 
We speak of some as men of magnanimous character, 
and of others as showing a petty character. So, too, we 
distinguish between characters as unselfish or selfish, just 
or unjust, where in every case the reference includes 
breadth of outlook as well as emotional relation. 
Width of outlook, however, is rather a matter of the 
relation of the self to its surroundings than of extent 
or kind of information. Amount of learning and kind 
of occupation are properly excluded from character. We 
speak of a learned or ignorant man but not of a learned 
or ignorant character. For ‘learned’ and ‘ignorant? 
colloquially refer to certain somewhat arbitrarily selected 
parts of human experience. A ploughman whose appre- 
hension of his relations to his fellows and of his rights 
in comparison with theirs is perfectly clear and just may 
be profoundly ignorant of the sciences and the arts, yet 
deeply learned in what is essential to the conduct of his 
own life. This practical knowledge of life we do include 
w. 26
-P-A-G-E-485
466 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
in character, but we do not commonly call it knowledge. 
So we may find equally admirable, or equally despicable, 
characters in all walks of life. Rank and culture give 
no presumption for or against excellence of character, 
A bricklayer may have as fine a character as a bishop, 
and a duke be as admirable as a docker. 
I no more share the expectation that increased ‘know- 
ledge? will, of itself, improve character, than the exactly 
opposite opinion of Mandeville, who two hundred years 
ago asserted that “‘ Vice in general is no where more 
predominant than where Arts and Sciences flourish... 
and it is certain that we shall find Innocence and Honesty 
no where more general than among the most illiterate, 
the poor silly Country People.” 
It is important to be clear on this point, for on it much 
confusion seems to prevail. Increase of knowledge does 
not necessarily mean increase of worth measured by 
ethical or social standards, It is not through the im- 
parting of information but through the moulding of 
character that general education makes for the good of 
the community. There is no necessary connexion 
between the two. The knowledge which is acquired 
may in no sense enlarge that width of outlook which 
does enter into character, but may simply be an increased 
power of seeing where personal advantage lies, and of 
planning to secure that, regardless of the rights and 
claims of others. Nevertheless, it is true that a usual 
defect of ignorance is narrowness, and this always means 
that personal opinions are exalted into universal truths 
“Intensely, thoroughly ignorant people attain to a height 
of self-esteem that the man who has spent a lifetime in 
amassing knowledge, only to find that all he knows is

-P-A-G-E-486
CHARACTER 467 
but a drop in the full cup of knowledge, can never hope 
to reach.” So knowledge which throws light upon the 
individual’s place in the world and upon his relations to 
his fellows does help him to distinguish between personal 
prejudice and generally received principle. But it is 
evident that much of the information given in school 
does not satisfy this test. So it may be said generally 
that if advance in what is commonly called knowledge 
does make for improvement in character, it does so 
indirectly and because the general trend of the education 
gives it its true position and perspective. 
So far we have considered what may be called the 
wider sense in which ‘character? is used. There is 
certainly a narrower sense implied in such expressions 
as ‘A is a man of much character’, ‘B is wanting in 
character’, or in Pope’s libellous assertion that 
“Most women have no characters at all.”2 
When we examine the context of such judgements we 
invariably find that the reference is to strength and per- 
sistence of purpose. Sometimes this is explicitly stated. 
“The face which character wears to me is self-sufficing- 
ness.... Character is centrality, the impossibility of being 
displaced or overset” wrote Emerson.? Similarly in 
J. S. Mills Essay On Liberty we read : ‘‘ A person whose 
desires and impulses are his own—are the expression of 
his own nature, as it has been developed and modified 
by his own culture—is said to have a character. One 
whose desires and impulses are not his own has no 
character, no more than a steam-engine has a character.” 
That eminent psychologist M. Ribot adopts the same

-P-A-G-E-487
468 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
limitation: ‘‘In order to constitute a character, two 
conditions are necessary and sufficient: unity and sta- 
bility. Unity consists in a manner of acting and reacting 
which is always consistent with itself....Stability is 
merely unity continued in time.?? 
Of course, if this be interpreted literally it results in 
the denial of character to the great majority of adults and 
to practically all children. M. Ribot does, indeed, deny 
that any but the minority have any true character. “It 
is clear that among the innumerable individuals of the 
human species, there must be some, and these by far the 
greater number, who have neither unity nor stability, 
nor personal characteristics peculiar to themselves.”? 
But though this sense of the word ‘character’ is one 
of those sanctioned by usage yet it seems to be elliptical. 
When we speak of a man of intellect we mean a man of 
unusually fine intellect, but we do not intend to deny 
intellect to the rest of mankind. So when we speak of 
a man of character we mean a man of unusually definite 
character. That this does not implicitly class the 
majority of people as characterless seems to be shown 
by the fact that “a weak character” is an accepted 
expression. 
It becomes evident that strength is the especial 
mark of character when we remember that character is 
shown in conduct, and that we judge another’s char- 
acter by his conduct, and by that alone. A man of 
developed character is essentially one whose life is unified 
by a consistent purpose and who does not change that 
main purpose according to the surroundings in which he 
finds himself, though he may modify the mode in which

he strives for its attainment. When a man ignores cir- 
cumstances and pushes on indifferent to them we do not 
call him a strong, but an obstinate, character. Strength 
means making use of obstacles, neither refusing to recog- 
nize them nor being dominated by them. The man of 
strong character develops not by adaptation zo environ- 
ment but by adaptation of environment to himself. 
The weak character develops by adaptation # environ- 
ment. The obstinate character refuses to acknowledge 
the existence of environment in so far as it is distasteful 
to him and can in any way be ignored. 
Consistent striving for purpose—that is, strength of 
character—however, implies not only power to make use 
of circumstances but internal self-mastery. As Emerson 
finely says: “‘ Character is the moral order seen through 
the medium of an individual nature.” External 
matters excite within us various instinctive impulses ; 
and as the external situation changes so do the impulses 
it excites. There are thus two sets of forces always 
acting on a persistent purpose to turn it aside. One is 
the opposition of the external world—the difficulties put 
in our way by people or circumstances, difficulties often 
unforeseen. To overcome them involves struggle, often 
painful and, it may be, attended by frequent failure and 
disappointment. The other is the treachery of our own 
passions and appetites, which incite us to seize the enjoy- 
ment of the moment, regardless both of the present 
neglect of purpose and of the danger of forming a habit 
which can but weaken character. 
Weakness of character may, then, be shown in two 
ways. There is first the individual who has no real 
personality ; who is moulded by his surroundings, who

-P-A-G-E-489
470 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
takes his opinions and his aims from others, who is 
dominated by the external. This is the moral and social 
weathercock, who shifts from moment to moment, blown 
this way and that by every breath of public opinion, 
He is weak because he has no resisting power and no 
initiative. Such a character is an unhealthy and morbid 
development of an emotional temperament blessed with 
neither much will nor much intelligence. 
Then there is the person of volatile temperament who 
has never learned to curb his impulses. He also 
responds continually to his environment, but he does so, 
not in the passive kind of way of the formless character 
we have just outlined, but in the excitable and spasmodic 
activity to which gratification of every impulse leads. 
. He may take up a purpose, but he soon drops it. He, 
like Dryden’s Achitophel, is ‘‘ Everything by turns, and 
nothing long” He is the slave not of his external sur- 
roundings but of his internal impulses. To gratify 
them he will often exhibit feverish bursts of effort to 
change his circumstances. As the former type is want- 
ing in energy, this latter is defective in the control of 
energy. 
This leads us to another important point. Suppose 
the life to be generally ruled by purpose. Are we then 
to stigmatize the character as weak if the individual 
follows the present incitement? It would often, I think, 
be more correct to say that the character is imperfectly 
formed. As the bearing of various purposes on conduct 
is more clearly seen, the character may prove to be of 
considerable strength. The present defect may be one 
of intelligence and experience, rather than of desire of 
will. For it seems to me that it is not the whole of life 
which can be included in character, but only that part
-P-A-G-E-490
CHARACTER 4a7t 
which is known to ourselves. We say sometimes that 
a particular action is quite opposed to a man’s character. 
Yet it may be certain that he did it. No doubt we 
require unquestionable proof when we believe the char- 
acter a strong one; but we acknowledge the possibility. 
Can we not also in our own experience find times when 
we acted in opposition to our general plan of life, and, 
it may be, repented bitterly afterwards? So it would 
seem to be allowable to say that the character may be 
intrinsically strong and yet that the life may show some 
want of harmony. Of course, the older the individual 
the less would this be true, for with extended experience 
and developed intelligence the bearings of actions are 
more and more made manifest. But in dealing with 
the young it is a very important consideration. Not 
every vagary of behaviour is to be taken as a proof that 
there is no sound core of character. 
If we now gather up the threads of our discussion we 
shall say that the dominant note of character is organiza- 
tion, By a person’s character we understand the extent 
to which his life is directed towards a definite end, and 
tuled by definite principle. "We mark our sense of the 
value of that end by adjectives which imply that it may be 
admirable or contemptible, or of any intermediate shade. 
In a perfect character the whole life would be so 
organized ; the aim would be the highest, the outlook 
the most inclusive, the will the most persistent. 
“How happy is he born and taught 
That serveth not another’s will; 
Whose armour is his honest thought, 
And simple truth his utmost skill,”? 
1Sir Henry Wotton,

472, THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
Certainly this would not mean that all such characters 
would be alike. Each would be relative to the life it 
has to live, and each would in addition have its own 
personal idiosyncrasies. The various temperaments if 
perfectly developed throughout life would give different 
types of character, yet each perfect of its own kind. 
There would be the character whose ideals are essentially 
practical but who would seek those ideals in the best 
and most worthy way. There would be that whose 
predominant note would be fine feeling, but in which 
that feeling found expression in noble and beautiful 
deeds. There would also be the character organized, so 
to say, round the intellect, with a keen sense of right 
and truth and duty. 
Nor can our ideals of perfect womanliness coincide 
with those of perfect manliness. Neither a mannish 
- woman nor an effeminate man satisfies the aspirations of 
mankind. 
So, not only is there no uniformity in the actual 
characters around us, but there is no such thing as one 
ideal of a good character to which all should try to 
approach, and all deviation from which is a mark of 
inferiority. Our custom of speaking in general abstract 
terms obscures this. Nor is the result simply theo- 
retical. How many a child has been morally ruined 
because those who brought him up did not understand 
him, did not see what must be his only true line 
of development, and so tried—with the best intentions 
in the world it may be—to force him into a mould 
absolutely foreign to his nature? The first thing it is 
essential to recognize in bringing up a child is that there 
is one, and only one, general way in which He can attain 
his perfect stature, and that that way is determined by
-P-A-G-E-492
CHARACTER 473 
his inner nature, not by the prepossessions of those under 
whose charge and control he lives. 
The actual characters of men, women, and children, 
are never perfect. They therefore differ, not only as 
temperament and disposition would cause them to differ, 
but also in the stage of development they have reached. 
We may go further and say that they are unlike in the 
stage of development they are capable of reaching. It 
would be to shut one’s eyes to facts to deny that some 
children are born with weak wills, with shallow feelings, 
with dull and obtuse intellects. Soon any or all of these 
defects become apparent. They can no more be removed 
than a physical organic defect can be cured. In this 
sense it is true that ‘‘no change of circumstances can 
repair a defect of character.”! Yet it is quite possible to 
mistake what is the result of bad training for an inherent 
defect. Who would venture to say of a vacillating adult 
whom he has not known most intimately from early 
childhood that he was born weak? As an originally 
good bodily constitution is sometimes ruined by riotous 
and irregular bodily living so an originally good: moral 
constitution may be ruined by riotous and irregular 
moral and mental living. 
Moreover, although it is doubtless true that the 
original nature of everyone imposes a limitation on the 
possibilities of his development, yet this by no means 
enables us to determine in any case what that limitation 
is. For each one of us the possibilities of development 
both for himself and for those whom he tries to educate 
must be regarded as boundless. Of course, develop- 
ment will be more rapid in some cases than in others. 
Yet even here it is easy to be deceived. Development 
1Emerson: Essay on Character.
-P-A-G-E-493
474 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
is seldom, if ever, uniform in any aspect of life. So the 
apparently slow development of one as compared with 
another at any one time may be compensated, or more 
than compensated, by 2 more rapid development at 
another time. ‘‘ Nature never rhymes her children, nor 
makes two men alike.’1 And this is as true of their 
mode and rate of growth as it is of the kind of character 
that growth is slowly evolving. 
It follows that in estimating the character of a child 
we must not apply the standard of an adult. That 
would be as absurd and unjust as to test his intellectual 
or physical powers in a similar way. According to his 
psychological age we must judge him. And his psycho- 
logical age, or stage of mental advancement, does not 
always agree with his physical age. A child may be 
either more or less advanced in all that concerns the inner 
life than most children of its age and sex. For all 
educational purposes, it is the psychological age that 
counts. 
It is certain, then, that ‘‘ character is not ready-made, 
but is created bit by bit and day by day”?. But howis 
it created? We are often told that the work of educa- 
tion is to build up character, and the parent and teacher 
are exhorted to form the characters of their children. 
All such suggestions of the passivity and plasticity of 
the child are the outcome of the false psychological 
hypothesis that our being is wholly determined from 
without which we have already rejected as untrue to the 
facts of life. It would be much more true to say that 
each person builds or forms his own character, for char- 
acter develops only in the conscious voluntary life ia 
which we deliberately set up ideals and purposes, and 
1 Emerson: Essay on Character. 2Edna Lyall : In the Golden Days
-P-A-G-E-494
CHARACTER 475 
plan means to realize them. For, as has already been 
said, character is that within us of which we are conscious 
as emphatically ourselves. It cannot begin to develop 
out of original natural endowment till the child learns 
to distinguish between himself and the things around 
him from which he receives impressions, This, how- 
ever, is very early in infancy. It may seem strained 
and far-fetched to speak of the character of a baby. But 
Ido so only in the samie sense in which one could speak 
of the intelligence of the same baby. Neither character 
nor intelligence deserves the name when judged from 
the standard of later life, but in each case there is the 
seed from which alone the fruit can spring. 
From such seed character can develop only in one 
way—through the determinate activity of the child 
itself. But, be it noted, the activity is one of will. Of 
course, the will shows itself in bodily action, but it is 
the will, and not the action, which is the essential thing. 
Will is moreover, as has been shown, opposed both from 
without and from within. The former opposition has 
tither to be taken up into the will itself or to be removed. 
The latter cannot be removed : it can only be overcome. 
Here we have an absolutely fundamental distinction. 
If the hindrances from within are not conquered and 
brought into subjection the child becomes a slave to his 
passions; he grows up vacillating, untrustworthy, and 
ineffective, unable to secure any result worth attaining 
because he has no self-control, no persistence. In a 
word, his character is in a stage of arrested development. 
Among the outer hindrances, however, are those 
which are due to the nature of things, and to these he 
must learn to accommodate his actions if he would carry 
out his will. ‘‘ All our strength and success in the work
-P-A-G-E-495
476 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
of our hands depend on our borrowing the aid of the 
elements. You have seen a carpenter on a ladder with 
a broad-axe chopping upward chips froma beam. How 
awkward! at what disadvantage he works! But see 
him on the ground, dressing his timber under him. 
Now, not his feeble muscles, but the force of gravity, 
brings down the axe; that is to say, the planet itself 
splits his stick.”? 
Yet more important and more directly pertinent to the 
development of character is the recognition that there 
are laws and elements in the human world which can be 
made hindrances and helps to the execution of purpose 
as can those in the physical world. Here is seen the 
psychological explanation of the supposed paradox 
that a child is trained to freedom through discipline. 
Effective discipline works on the core of character. If 
compulsion be appealed to, it is merely to bring home 
to the understanding that human law cannot be violated 
with impunity. That is only the first stage. The 
second is to inspire in the child the desire to be his own 
master. Nor is this difficult if it be done through con- 
crete experiences as they arise. For instance, children 
do make up their minds to work steadily at their lessons 
and yet yield to solicitations to amusement which defeat 
that purpose. A boy is quite capable of recognizing 
that in this he has not been what he meant to be, or done 
what he meant to do. In other words he grasps that his 
action was antagonistic to the character he is forming and 
which expressed itself in the neglected purpose. I have 
little faith in the influence on the development of the 
character of a child of set courses of lessons about 
morality. In the influence of the recognition that he

-P-A-G-E-496
CHARACTER 477 
has, in such and such a particular instance, fallen below 
himself, I have much. The teaching of morality, if it is 
to be successful, must be as concrete as is morality itself, 
and that it can be only when it touches immediately an 
actual piece of child life. Even with adults there are 
few who are really moved to action by abstract ideas and 
principles, and when they are, the action is commonly 
wanting in vigour. With children the moving-force is 
always dyed with emotion. In the formation of char- 
acter the emotion of self-respect plays an indispensable 
part. 
A child’s character, therefore, is not trained by leaving 
him to do as he likes, but by evoking in him by sym- 
pathetic suggestion the desire to obtain thorough self- 
mastery. And, let me add, the stronger the character 
of the suggestor, providing it be not lacking in the 
magnetism of personal sympathy and be kept under wise 
constraint, the more effective will be such attempt to 
tvoke the will. Such evoking is the one and only 
condition on which character can be trained. 
In these considerations, too, we reach the sense in 
which it is true to say that character is a system of habits. 
Evidently the habits which enter into character are those 
established tendencies of will and feeling which we have 
called habitudes; not the various acquired forms of 
automatism of bodily movement. The evil practical 
influence of the false hypothesis of the absolute plasticity 
of the child has nowhere been more amply shown than 
here. Mere drill in matters of outward behaviour has 
been believed to be efficacious in forming character, 
because it induces uniformity of action. The surprise 
has been as real as it has been painful when, over and 
over again, the youth has shown a character quite
-P-A-G-E-497
478 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
antithetical to that which his parents or masters 
had fondly believed they were forming. From our 
point of view this is no matter for amazement. 
Whatever fails to affect the will remains outside the 
formation of character. In the cases we are considering 
the influences which are really operative on will are feel- 
ings of resentment and of antagonism to the restraint, 
and these are easily and naturally transferred to the laws 
and principles which the restraints are intended to 
implant. The mistaken regulation of action has an 
influence on will, but it is an influence exactly opposite 
to that intended and desired. 
The development of real habitudes of harmonious 
will, feeling, and thought, is, on the other hand, the 
formation of the chief element of strength of character. 
With every exercise they increase in power, in pro- 
pulsive force, and in width of reference. So they are 
brought more and more into harmonious relation with 
each other, and collect into a systematic hierarchy. Ina 
mental life thus organized the incidental impulses of the 
moment have but little chance of turning aside the main 
current of purpose. Certainly it must be granted that 
organization may degenerate into mechanism, and so the 
spiritual life be made too automatic. ‘The multitude 
stands by the formulas that profess to solve the eternal 
problem. It follows them blindly, like the schoolboy 
who cares not whether they are right or wrong, of 
whether the answer is conclusive. So long as there is 
an answer of some sort its mind is easy.” This results 
from too narrow a purpose and too restricted an outlook. 
Not intellectual principles but uninformed prejudices 
are embedded in the habitudes of such a life. Real 
IW, J. Locke: 4¢ the Gate of Samaria, ch. 2.
-P-A-G-E-498
CHARACTER 479 
living habitudes are trends of life; they are not the 
cerements of past life. Thus they carry in themselves 
the power of adaptation, and meet new occasions in 
fresh ways. 
It is further true that a character may be admirable in 
its unity and stability and yet far from admirable in its 
totality. That is because its outlook and aim do not 
commend themselves to the moral judgement. Many 
a miser has shown the extreme of self-control and the 
most marked persistence in amassing gold. But such 
an aim has not in it those marks of humanity, that power 
of satisfying human aspirations, which alone can win 
general human approval. 
Character is, then, the true self. It is that which we 
love, or which we dislike, in another. It is that which 
wins love or attracts antipathy to ourselves. For high 
intellect, for artistic genius, for mighty power of com- 
mand, for great oratorical gifts, for wonderful inventive 
ability, for charming manners, we feel admiration. But 
we love and reverence only those whose gifts are em- 
bedded in a noble character. And our reverence and 
love are in proportion to the beauty of character, not 
to the greatness of the gifts. So it is that the great 
changes in the world have been due to men of strong 
character. ‘‘It is indisputable that the preat movements 
which stir society from its very foundations, are invari- 
ably produced by the workings of the living spirit of 
man. The sense of moral and intellectual want which 
disposes men to seize on new opinions often lies for 
centuries fermenting in the fathomless depths of the 
heart of society. At length, in the fullness of time, 
atises one of those master spirits, endowed with the 
genius, energy, and confidence, which fit a man to wield
-P-A-G-E-499
480 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
these moral forces; to reveal to his age the wants of 
which it had but a dim and perplexed consciousness ; to 
interpret to it itsown confused and half-formed opinions, 
and to give them shape, compactness, and strength.”! 
Yet more pertinent to our subject is the consideration 
that such an influence is personal, and is most strong 
over those who are brought into direct contact with it. 
In other words, it is character which counts in influencing 
others, so that men or women of weak character can never 
be really effective influences on the lives of the children 
entrusted to them. On the other hand, the insistent 
dominating character, when through loving sympathy it 
avoids raising opposition, must be always on guard lest 
it also, by blocking the way of all initiative and by culti- 
vating a habit of relying on another instead of on self, 
prove antagonistic to the desired growth of the young. 
Necessary as it is to insist that character is essentially 
formed from within, so that each one of us is responsible 
for the character he-is, that is, for himself, yet it would 
be a mischievous one-sided misrepresentation to ignore 
the constant moulding forces from without. I have not 
so much in mind now the personal influence of indi- 
viduals, often as powerful as it is direct, as the general all- 
pervading tone of society in which each has to live. For 
that determines in a general way the more direct in- 
fluences brought to bear on the child in family and in 
school. They are certainly more operative in the family, 
for the sphere of the school, and consequently its forma- 
tive influence, are more limited than those of the family. 
In the latter, life is lived in all its aspects ; in the former, 
only in some of its relations. ‘The school is an artificial 
group, the family a natural one. While, therefore, both 
1Ranke : History of the Popes, trans. by S. Austen, vol. ii, p. 1.
-P-A-G-E-500
CHARACTER 481 
reflect the tone of the community, the family does so 
more fully and more freely than the school. Moreover, 
in the school that influence is often modified by the 
conservatism of tradition which secures the survival of 
ideas and ideals of the past which, outside the school, 
may have become mere pale ghosts, or specimens of 
social or moral archaeology. 
The mind and character of the nation, then, affect the 
individual child chiefly through the family. But as he 
grows older he enters more and more into direct contact 
with wider circles. From the carefully tended garden 
of the school he goes forth into the open field of life, 
and though he will meet with great variety of opinions 
yet he will find a general tendency to view life in one 
fundamental aspect. The many opinions, though diver- 
gent in innumerable ways, nearly all express the general 
attitude of the community towards life. 
We have seen that character is self-development and 
implies self-knowledge and self-control. We have seen, 
further, that hindrances to the true growth of character 
are all antagonistic to fixity of purpose and consistency of 
aim. It follows that communities which offer many 
inducements to deviation from purpose, and which furnish 
few opportunities for self-communion, are unfavourable 
to the development of strong unified characters. An 
abnormally strong natural will holds on its way with little 
or no regard to continual solicitations to wander. But 
the ordinary person is much affected by his surroundings. 
If conditions be favourable his will may grow strong ; if 
they be antagonistic the development of his character 
will be arrested. In any case there will be imperfection 
which in more favourable circumstances would have 
been avoided. A weak will under favourable conditions

may learn to stand alone; amid adverse influences it is 
bound to suffer moral shipwreck and to grow into one of 
those defective forms of character which we have already 
considered. 
After such general considerations I would ask the 
reader to recall the estimate of our national character 
which I quoted from a most competent French observer.! 
May I then beg him to consider the question whether 
there are not in our present public life many influences 
antagonistic to the preservation of that self-control and 
determination which stand out so clearly in Dr. Le Bon’s 
picture? The following extract from an article on 
Reactions in The Times* certainly deserves serious 
consideration : 
“The Greeks, perhaps, had a peculiar need of the 
doctrine of the golden mean because of the richness and 
instability of their natures. In conduct, in politics, and 
in all kinds of theory, they seem to have been subject to 
violent enthusiasms and reactions. A new idea spread 
among them like fire through stubble; and the very 
eagerness with which they welcomed it made them 
equally ready to forget an old one. ‘They were, for the 
most part, a people of towns and subject to the contagion 
of crowds, that mysterious contagion which seems to act, 
as it were, physically on the mind and to pervert the 
reason so that it turns traitor against itself. In the past 
we have been inclined to despise both the Greeks and 
the modern French for their instability while wondering 
at their intelligence. We might be slow, but we were 
not infirm of purpose. We did not worship a popular 
idol one day and break it in pieces the next. We could 
boast thus of ourselves in the past, but can we in the 
1 See pp. 105-106. 2 Nov. roth, 1910.

CHARACTER 483 
present? We have to remember that in the last hundred 
years or more we have been changing from a country 
into a town people, that we are now subject toa contagion 
of the crowd which is new in our history. We know 
how the Romans changed their nature when they too 
changed from a country to a town people; how they 
acquired the Greek instability without much of the 
Greek intelligence, how the mob of Rome became incap- 
able of governing either the world or themselves. That 
is the fate that threatens us also unless we can by an 
effort of will preserve the ancient firmness of our char- 
acter. In particular we need to be on our guard against 
the swift and incessant reactions that more and more tend 
to waste and distract our energies. We cannot flatter 
ourselves that these reactions affect only the passions of 
the ignorant. They are just as violent and common 
among people of culture, and produce the same incessant 
change in our ideas and tastes as in our popular songs 
and catch-words. Indeed, as the ignorant mob turns 
year by year from one mechanical joke to another, so the 
cultivated mob turns from one set of ideas and from one 
jargon to another. The contagion of the crowd works 
with equal power in both cases and with equal unreason. 
It is not spread by popular assemblies, but by books and 
newspapers ; and the superior people who despise the 
mob are themselves a mob of readers and talkers at the 
mercy of mob reactions. 
“The worst evil of these reactions in morals, in ideas, 
and in art is that they waste the experience of ages. Just 
as the individual who is at the mercy of reactions never 
profits by his own experience, but, as it were, is born 
again a fool with each new infatuation that masters him, 
80 it is with a mob that runs after every new fashion of
-P-A-G-E-503
484 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
thought. Every fresh theory for them cancels all old 
ones. When Nietzsche is the fashionable prophet he 
sweeps away the Commandments, the Gospels, and Kant. 
It is as if no one had ever learned anything about life 
before him. His philosophy is welcomed for the mere 
pleasure of the shock which it gives; and when that 
shock has spent itself the philosophy will be dropped, as 
a monkey drops one nut to clutch at another. The 
wisest men know that in all things there is an orthodoxy 
of the ages, which should be modified and strengthened 
by the experience of each new generation. They react 
only against the errors of the past, and they are careful 
not to react too far. But the cultivated mob is tired of 
all orthodoxy, and it reacts against it for the mere pleasure 
of reaction. Thus it falls a prey to the oldest of heresies, 
even the heresies of Thrasymachus, if only it has never 
heard of them before. And by its absurdities it confirms 
dull men in their dullness and brings all speculation into 
disrepute. Nowadays there is in England a solid mass 
of Philistines who profess that they have no interest in 
discovering the truth about anything, because ideas 
about the truth are incessantly changing. Their 
scepticism is not philosophic, but lazy; yet it is the 
intellectuals who provide them with their excuse. Truth 
is, indeed, undiscoverable by those who grow tired of it 
if it is not-new; for they do not even look for it, and 
do not know it if they find it by accident.” 
Happily it seems established that the fundamentals 
of national character do not change so rapidly that a new 
kind of nature is at once transmitted to succeeding 
generations. But if the national life in the present culti- 
vate qualities antagonistic to those inherited from the 
past the formative effect on each new rising generation
-P-A-G-E-504
CHARACTER 485 
will be cumulative. The disease may first attack the 
surface of the national character, but if it be unchecked 
it will surely eat into its heart. 
I believe nobody will deny that our age is marked by 
hurry and bustle, by love of novelty and of excitement, 
by constant occupation with the outer things of life. 
“ The world is too much with us; late and soon, 
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers :”1 
wrote Wordsworth, and it is certain that the century 
which has since elapsed has not diminished the ground 
of his lament. 
It would be futile to gird at the actual course of things. 
One should, however, try to recognize what is harmful 
in influence and in tendency, so that amid the gains which 
time brings we may not lose the treasure passed on from 
the past. 
The one constant determining feature in all the 
developments of the life of our age is the continuous 
increase in the demands made by external affairs on our 
time and energy. It is true that there are powerful and 
successful movements for reducing the hours of manual 
labour. But from the standpoint of the development of 
character the allurements of pleasure are more dangerous 
than the demands of work. Of course, all must recog- 
nize that there is need for recreation. That surely goes 
without saying. All that is here urged is that the tendency 
of modern life, particularly in large towns, is towards 
supplying incentives to occupy a// the time and energy 
in ways in which the sole determination of experience 
is from without. It may be a concert, it may be a 
theatre, it may be a music-hall, it may be a football match, 
- 1 Wordsworth : Sonnets.
-P-A-G-E-505
486 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
it may be a political meeting. All these, and their like, 
good as they are in due proportion, so crowd upon each 
other that many people live on from day to day, never 
thinking except about the immediate concerns of their 
families, their business, or their pleasure ; never, that is 
to say, deliberately setting up before themselves an ideal 
of life, never asking themselves what is the value to them 
of those things in which they spend their energies so 
profusely. 
If we apply the analysis of this chapter to such a state 
of mind we see that it means that life is determined from 
without not from within. Either the character has that 
excessive plasticity which makes the man a mere echo of 
the opinions, and a mere copy of the actions, of those 
with whom he associates; or it has the instability and 
the self-indulgence—which of necessity involves the 
crudest selfishness—of the man whose impulses and 
passions rule his life. 
The signs that these elements of weakness are widely 
diffused in our day seem to me both numerous and insis- 
. tent. The entertainments which are most popular are 
becoming increasingly frivolous and meaningless. They 
attract through an obvious kind of trivial prettiness 
when they do not appeal through a vulgar suggestive- 
ness. Nor is there force in the contention that the 
audiences have so exhausted their minds in thought that 
they are too tired for any but the lightest stimulation. 
‘Without want of charity it may be suggested that an 
equally tenable hypothesis is that their minds are numbed 
and atrophied from want of exercise in anything out- 
side the immediate demands of their material lives. 
“Machines have not yet come to life among us, but they 
are beginning to exercise a tyranny which is the more  
-P-A-G-E-506
CHARACTER 487 
oppressive in that it is mechanical and blind. There is 
no tyranny so hard and intimate as that which controls 
amusements, and this mechanical tyranny is changing 
the nature of our amusements in every direction. If a 
tyrant of flesh and blood tried to do this we should 
instantly rebel; but we submit to the tyranny of 
machinery without a murmur; indeed, we seem scarcely 
to be aware of it. The reason is that it appeals to all the 
lazy and negative part of our minds.... 
“The growth of mechanical amusements is only a 
natural development from the purely passive enjoyment 
of art. There was once a time when the artist was not 
specialized in England, when most people, both high and 
low, rich and poor, were trained to amuse each other 
and themselves. Music and dancing and acting in the 
age of Elizabeth were arts practised by the people, not 
by professionals for the people. Shakespeare laughs in 
4 Midsummer Nights Dream at the amateur players 
of the time, just as amateurs are laughed at in the amus- 
ing Pantomime Rehearsal. But there is this striking 
difference between the two plays, that in the one the 
amateurs are of the people, and in the other they are of 
the aristocracy. Bottom would be an impossibility in 
a modern burlesque because his original does not exist 
now, or is only a romantic rarity in some out-of-the-way 
villages. Indeed, some wise and excellent people are 
trying to revive Bottom as they are trying to revive 
morris dances and folksong. But they have many 
difficulties to contend with. Every class in this country 
has lost the habit of amusing itself artistically. The 
poor as well as the rich look to professionals to amuse 
them, and have a profound distrust of their own artistic 
powers and a false shame in exercising them. The
-P-A-G-E-507
488 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
artist, whether actor, musician, or dancer, is regarded as 
a peculiar person, half admired and half despised. He 
is not, as he once was, merely a2 man who can do what 
every one does, only better. He is a professional enter- 
tainer with mysterious powers of his own, which ordinary 
people do not share and cannot understand ; and they 
would think it indecent presumption to attempt to com- 
pete with him. This has gone so far that they would 
rather hear a professional singer on a gramophone than 
an amateur in the flesh; and now in our villages the 
gramophone on summer evenings pours out trash from 
the music-halls to an audience that has forgotten the 
very names of the old songs and the steps of the old 
dances. Perhaps in another generation, where cricket 
is now played on the village greens there will be cine- 
matograph pictures of matches at Lord’s or the Oval.”? 
The same inertia of the life of thought and activity of 
the life of the senses are shown in a love of excitement 
which is often so artificial as to appear neurotic. For 
example, consider the popular daily press with its 
hysterical comments on passing events and its exagget- 
ated headlines. Consider also the kind of appeal so 
often made to popular gatherings by politicians seeking 
parliamentary honours. Think of the garbled state- 
ments of fact, the suggestion of the false, the suppression 
of the true, the sound and fury of the empty bombast 
and the frothy inflated rhetoric, the violence of personal 
invective, the ludicrous poverty of argument, which con- 
stitute such displays. By partisan journals on the same 
side these effusions are lauded as ‘ great,’ ‘strong’ and 
‘historic’, in sublime disregard of their want of basis 
in fact and yet more striking defects in reasoning. Not

CHARACTER 489 
seldom to the dispassionate observer the greatness seems 
to consist in pettiness of outlook and the strength in 
weakness of logic veiled by audacity of assertion. When 
speeches are made on popular platforms which the orator 
would not venture to repeat in the House of Commons, 
the inference is irresistible that he is trading on the im- 
perfect knowledge, the deficiency in critical power, the 
appetite for excitement, and the susceptibility to the 
moulding influence of mere blind party-spirit, in his 
hearers. In other words, he is taking advantage of the 
weakness of character in those he addresses, as well as 
exhibiting unlovely traits of his own character. That 
he is also helping to accentuate those deficiencies is very 
unlikely to have occurred to him. He, too, looks only 
to the present effect. 
These have only been adduced as signs fairly easy to 
read of a want of stability which the present condi- 
tions of our national life tend to cultivate. Another 
such sign is the feverish haste to get the last new thing, 
or to adopt the last new fashion whether of dress, of art, 
of speech, or of any other mode of activity. Even in 
education there is a dangerous tendency to forget that 
“new? and ‘true’ are neither synonymous in meaning 
nor identical in application. 
Some, with the optimism natural to youth, may think 
that the picture just drawn is too darkly coloured. To 
this I would reply that it is not presented as a picture of 
the whole of the community, but only as a setting-forth 
of features which can surely be found by any one who 
looks for them. I do not contend that the evil is as yet 
deep-seated, though I fear it is wide-spread and still 
spreading. When one believes that one sees a wrong 
which can be remedied, or at least lessened, one’s duty
-P-A-G-E-509
493 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION 
is to point it out. The remedy for this social disease is 
plain to see if not easy to apply. Not easy, because it 
can only be applied by the people themselves, and they 
do not recognize that they are spiritually sick, just 
because the very nature of the disease keeps them from 
pondering such topics. 
Education, especially schoo] education, can do little 
directly. But it must do what it can, and here under 
‘education’, I include all personal agencies for the moral 
improvement and elevation of the people. Everything 
which strengthens self-respect and develops strength of 
purpose, which increases knowledge pertinent to life 
and cultivates critical thought, which broadens the social 
outlook and deepens charity, has an influence in develop- 
ing individual capacity and, through that development, 
in reducing the faults and in strengthening the virtues 
of that soul of the people on which alone the destinies 
of our country depend.
